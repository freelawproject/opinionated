Ms. Tanner alleges that there are genuine issues of material fact as to whether the LCG had knowledge of a dangerous condition of one of its manhole covers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On September 9, 2015, Ms. Tanner was going to the Legacy Bar on Jefferson Street in Lafayette, Louisiana. She forgot her driver's license, so she and a friend went back to her car to get it. She saw a friend across the street and proceeded to go to talk to the friend. The friend walking across the street with her was on her left and slightly behind her. According to Ms. Tanner's deposition, she took a couple of steps into the street. Ms. Tanner claims she stepped on a manhole cover and it popped up, hitting her ankle and leg, at which time her leg went in the manhole. As a result of the incident, she alleges she injured her knee and other body parts. Ms. Tanner stated that her friend said the manhole cover was flat before the accident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Ms. Tanner filed suit against the LCG on July 8, 2016. Subsequently, the LCG filed a motion for summary judgment. A hearing on the motion was held on September 10, 2018. Following the hearing, the trial court ruled that the LCG did not have actual or constructive knowledge of\n   any defects with the manhole cover. Judgment was signed on September 17, 2018, dismissing Ms. Tanner's claims against the LCG. Ms. Tanner then filed the present appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    SUMMARY JUDGMENT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On appeal, Ms. Tanner alleges the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of the LCG. She argues there are genuine issues of material fact concerning the LCG's knowledge of a dangerous condition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The summary judgment procedure is favored and \"designed to secure the just, speedy, and inexpensive determination of every action[.]\" La.Code Civ.P. art. 966(A)(2).

Wyble, the Public Works Civil Engineering Supervisor, project control for the LCG, and Eddie Wiltz, Project Coordinator for the LCG, were taken. Excerpts from these depositions were introduced by the LCG in support of its motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The LCG does not deny that it owns the manhole cover involved in this case. Mr. Wyble, an employee with the LCG for thirty-two-and-a-half years, explained that his department would pick and choose the manhole covers depending on the application it would be used for. This cover was installed in the early to mid-1990s when Jefferson Street was reconstructed. The cover is in an area off the street in a corner by the driveway entrance to a parking lot and next to a fire hydrant. It is a standard manhole cover without vents. The cast-iron cover weighs 120 pounds and requires a special tool similar to a crowbar to lift it. There is no mechanism to keep the cover in place except the weight of the cover. Mr. Wyble stated that a locking mechanism on a manhole cover may be necessary if it is in the wheel path of a vehicle. However, the LCG has no policy of placing locking mechanisms on manhole covers. The LCG tries to keep manholes off travel lanes and out to the edge because it does not want someone working in a manhole in the path of a vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Mr. Wyble explained that water from the street does not enter the manhole but there are lines running under the manhole cover which drains the water. He stated that rainwater collected in the adjacent parking lot drains into lines running under the manhole cover. Mr. Wyble has seen a manhole cover get out of place before and agreed that excessive water in the street could lift a manhole cover, but he never saw a manhole cover in Lafayette lifted by water pressure. He also stated that not enough water gets into the basin to require ventilation. As explained by Mr. Wyble, the LCG does not inspect or maintain manhole covers unless a problem has been reported. There is also no policy in place for the LCG employees to report a dangerous condition, but they will report an issue if they see something.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Mr. Wiltz agreed that the LCG only inspects manholes if it receives a request due to a citizen's concern and there is no procedure in place to see if covers are sitting flush in the frame. He agreed that other employees would report a cover that is not flush in the frame. Mr. Wiltz was not aware of any reports of a cover not sitting flush in the frame. Mr. Wiltz's supervisor notified him of this accident, and he went to check it out a day or two later, but found nothing wrong with the cover. The frame was intact, and there were no breaks or cracks in the cover. There was no water in the drain. If an LCG employee accessed the manhole, there would be an express written order on file. There was none. Mr. Wiltz explained that private contractors are supposed to get permission from the LCG to assess the manhole, but they don't always.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In opposition to the motion for summary judgment, Ms. Tanner introduced the affidavit of Jason T. English, a professional engineering consultant from Texas. He stated that \"[a]bsent of intended removal of the lid with a special tool, the most likely causes for a manhole lid to become displaced are vehicular traffic, internal pressure due to liquid or gas, or damage to\n   the frame due to deterioration, shifting of the ground, or adjacent construction activities.\" Mr. English was critical of the LCG for failing to establish and implement an adequate safety inspection and maintenance program for manholes located in public walkways and streets. He also criticized the failure of the LCG to install a vented manhole lid and failure to install a secured lid. He opined that the lid was in the potential wheel path of traffic. Mr. English never examined the manhole cover.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   We first observe that the LCG's failure to have a plan for periodic inspections does not impute constructive notice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Scott\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7042670\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/52/1068/\">\n    52 So.3d 1068\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Jones v.

Furthermore, there is no evidence that the lid in question was lifted by water pressure. To the contrary, evidence indicated that there had never been a manhole cover displaced by water pressure in Lafayette. Pictures of the manhole cover attached to the depositions of Mr. Wyble and Mr. Wiltz clearly show that it is not in the wheel path of traffic, but in a corner of a raised curb, next to a driveway and fire hydrant, and out of the lane of travel.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Furthermore, pursuant to La.R.S. 32:143, no person shall park a vehicle within fifteen feet of a fire hydrant or in front of a public or private driveway, so that pursuant to the law, there should be no vehicles in this area. Additionally, there was never a report before this accident of the manhole cover being displaced. Following a report of this accident, Mr. Wiltz checked out the manhole cover and found no issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   We agree with the trial court that the LCG was entitled to summary judgment dismissing Ms. Tanner's case, as there is no genuine issue of material fact that the LCG did not have actual or constructive notice of any problems with this manhole cover.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.

The primary distinction is that, under strict liability, the plaintiff does not have to prove the owner or custodian of the thing which caused the damage knew or should have known of the potential risk involved.\n   <em>\n    Campbell v. La. Dept. of Transp. &amp; Development,\n   </em>\n   94-1052 (La. 1/17/95),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7463137\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/648/898/#p901\">\n    648 So.2d 898\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 901. However, under La. R.S. 9:2800, a plaintiff's burden is modified when pursuing a strict liability claim against a public entity (i.e., the DOTD) insofar as the plaintiff must prove \"... the public entity had actual or constructive notice of the particular vice or defect which caused the damage prior to the occurrence, and the public entity has had a reasonable opportunity to remedy the deficiency and failed to do so.\" La. R.S. 9:2800.\n   <strong>\n    While we question the DOTD's assertion that the Clarkstons failed to prove it had actual or constructive notice of a defect in the roadway where the accident took place and failed to remedy such, we nevertheless find the Clarkstons did not have to sustain such a burden. Surprisingly, the Clarkstons did not assert a cause of action under strict liability in its original or amended petitions.\n    <em>\n     As such, La. R.S. 9:2800 is inapplicable.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Therefore, we find no error in the trial court's denial of the motion for directed verdict.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The same is true here. The City's motion for summary judgment, the trial court ruling granting the motion, and the majority's affirmance are premised on the application of the notice requirement in La.R.S. 9:2800 and recovery under La.C.C. art. 2317.1. Nothing in Plaintiff's petition makes any claim or reference to strict liability. This court has recognized a plaintiff's right to \"premise[ its] right to recover on the legal theories of negligence and strict liability\" under either Article 2315 and/or Article 2317 and 2317.1.\n   <em>\n    Petre v.

But even if this were not the case, the trial court judgment must be reversed because of other legal errors, i.e. there are general issues of material fact regarding constructive notice. The majority says that LCG's \"failure to have a plan for periodic inspections does not impute constructive notice,\" citing the supreme court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Jones v.

English (English), opines that the manhole cover in this case should have either been bolted down or tack welded to avoid its coming loose through various occurrences, and it should also be vented to avoid becoming dislodged by water or gas pressure. The majority says \"[Mr. Wyble] never saw a manhole cover in Lafayette lifted by water pressure.\" But that is not an accurate recounting of the deposition testimony. Mitchell P. Wolfe (Wolfe), the Public Works Engineering Supervisor for the City, testified in his deposition that he \"was not aware\" of any \"City of Lafayette manhole cover\" being \"lifted from water pressure\"\n   <em>\n    but\n   </em>\n   <strong>\n    he had seen DOTD manhole covers lifted in the City of Lafayette\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    by water pressure.\n   </strong>\n   He further stated in his deposition testimony:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   A. This manhole cover has no vents.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   Q. Can these manhole covers come out of place by any reason, other than someone actually lifting it?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   A.\n   <strong>\n    Yes, they have.

The force of the water due to inundation of the street will sometimes policy and procedure (sic) the lid up.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Wolfe also testified in his deposition that when a manhole cover is in the path of vehicles it should be bolted down or tack welded in place. He says the cover here, in his layman's opinion, is not in the wheel path of vehicles, but he is not a qualified expert. Moreover, his reference to the cover being \"in the wheel path of a vehicle\" seems to refer to the traveling path of a vehicle on the street. Nevertheless, when pressed in his deposition he admits that vehicles may indeed pass over this manhole cover. English seems to consider the cover being \"in the wheel path of a vehicle\" to include location of the manhole cover where vehicles can roll over the cover. We are not in any position on summary judgment to make the determination of what \"in the wheel path\" means, nor can we reconcile the competing testimony without weighing evidence. English states that this cover\n   <em>\n    is in a wheel path\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    should be bolted down or tack welded to avoid becoming dislodged\n   </em>\n   . Moreover, English further stated in his affidavit, offered in opposition to the motion for summary judgment states (emphasis added):\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   LCG failed to install a secured lid, or secure the existing lid. Manhole lids/frames are readily available in a bolted design that allows the lid to be bolted to the frame to secure the lid from potential displacement. In fact, according to the testimony of the LCG representatives, manholes in their jurisdiction located in vehicular wheel paths are supposed to be a secured or bolted design.\n   <strong>\n    The manhole in this matter is located on the north side of Jefferson Street, in the potential wheel path of vehicles entering the adjacent parking lot from the street, or potential parking vehicles, especially temporary delivery trucks for the adjacent businesses.\n    <em>\n     In this regard, a manhole lid for the underground sewer system within 20 yards of the manhole in this matter is a bolted secured design, with numerous other bolted manhole lids along Jefferson street in this area\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n   LCG failed to comply with their own policy regarding the installation of secured manhole lids in potential vehicular wheel paths.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The majority says that a photo of the manhole cover \"clearly show[s] that it is not in the wheel path of traffic, but in a corner of a raised curb, next to a driveway and fire hydrant, and out of the lane of travel. Furthermore, pursuant to La.R.S. 32:143, no person shall park a vehicle within fifteen feet of a fire hydrant or in front of a public or private driveway, so pursuant to the law, there should be no vehicles in this area.\" This weighing of evidence and speculation by the majority is entirely inappropriate on summary judgment. It is at odds with the expert witness's testimony, and it is at odds with Wolfe's testimony for even he acknowledges \"there's always [the] possibility\" a vehicle could travel over this manhole cover. He clearly testified, as recounted by English in his affidavit, that if the cover is in a wheel path \"you would want to put a bolt down or lock it\" and \"if we, Lafayette Consolidated Government,\n   where going to have a manhole that had to be in the wheel path, we would require it to be a bolt-down.\" He also testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   Q. And on the day of this incident, did the City of Lafayette have anything to block or prevent a car from traveling on top of this manhole cover?\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   A.

Specifically, in his report, Mr. Blanchard noted that the school zone traffic control sign failed due to cyclical loading for which it was not designed. Mr. Blanchard opined that the City-Parish was negligent in purchasing and installing the subject fixture given the wind loads of the Baton Rouge area.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   The City-Parish has not addressed the assertions made in Mr. Blanchard's report that the sign selected was not sufficient to withstand the Baton Rouge area storm and wind conditions and Mr. Barnett's argument that the City therefore created the defect.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Mr. Blanchard's report creates a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether the City-Parish created the defective condition by its own substandard conduct in selecting and installing a potentially deficient sign in the Baton Rouge area. If established, under the current jurisprudence, either actual or constructive notice need not be proven or such knowledge of the hazardous condition could be presumed.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The City's witnesses here also state in deposition testimony that the City is aware of the fact that plumbers and other private contractors employed by business owners in the area need to enter this manhole \"from time to time\" for various purposes. Additionally, Wolfe and Wiltz acknowledge that these third parties are supposed to notify the city when they need to enter the manhole but do not do so. Thus, according to Wolfe and Wiltz, the City had actual notice of these authorized and unauthorized disturbances of manhole covers and yet the City proudly proclaims it does not inspect these manhole covers \"at all unless someone complains.\" Despite notice that third parties from \"time to time\" remove these manhole covers the City did nothing over the course of twenty years or more to determine whether their manhole covers were left in an unreasonably dangerous condition by these unauthorized or authorized third parties. One can easily surmise that one reason the City requires third parties to get permission to enter the manhole covers is so that the City can follow up and make sure the covers are replaced correctly. And yet, the City boldly proclaims\n   <em>\n    it has never made any effort to do so\n   </em>\n   . To add insult to injury, according to Wolfe,\n   <strong>\n    the City not only\n    <em>\n     has no requirement that its employees report any problem with the manhole cover\n    </em>\n    , but Wolfe says there is not even \"an expectation\" that any problem be reported by City workers\n   </strong>\n   . This statement by Wolfe belies the majority's statement that \"He agreed that other employees would report a cover that is not flush in the frame.\" Wolfe says reporting any perceived problem is \"self-driven\" by the employees. Additionally, when asked \"are any City of Lafayette employees trained or educated on at what point a manhole cover becomes a dangerous condition if its not flush with the street and its [not] sitting perfectly\" he replied (emphasis added):\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    No\n   </strong>\n   . I understand where you're coming from. We are not-I don't know of any training about going out and looking for manhole or drain covers that are not flush with the frame. Nine times out of ten, you would not be able to determine\n   that from a drive-by, and we don't inspect them at all that I'm aware of.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   This admitted failure on the part of the City to enforce its own requirements which relate to reasonable maintenance of its manhole covers further indicates that the City is deemed to know of any unreasonably dangerous condition which it could have easily avoided and/or discovered by enforcement of its policy. This bespeaks more than voluntary ignorance, it is willful negligence for which no notice, constructive or otherwise, is required to hold the City accountable.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   The requirement of notice to the municipality is inapplicable to a case where the dangerous condition is attributable to negligent acts of the city or its employees. Only where the negligence relied upon is the failure of the city to repair a defective condition not caused by its own act or\n   <strong>\n    neglect\n   </strong>\n   is the question of notice an essential element.\n   <em>\n    Pickens v.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    St. Tammany Parish,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9667262\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/323/430/\">\n    323 So.2d 430\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (La.1975).\n   <strong>\n    When the municipality creates the defective condition by its own substandard conduct, it is presumed to have knowledge of the hazardous condition.\n   </strong>\n   <em>\n    Toledano v.
