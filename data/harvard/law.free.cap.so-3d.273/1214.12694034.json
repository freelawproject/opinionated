For the reasons assigned, we reverse and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION OF THE RECORD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Mr. Espree, a sixteen-year employee of the defendant, Vanoil Completion Systems (Vanoil), claimed that he suffered a work-related injury, which resulted in the filing of a disputed claim for compensation on October 16, 2017. Mr. Espree was employed by Vanoil as press operator and hydrostatic tester, and his job duties included lifting, turning, and loading extremely heavy sections of pipe, called mandrels. Mr. Espree claimed that during the week of February 6, 2017, he sustained a rupture of a periumbilical hernia, together with lower back injuries, as a result of his heavy and strenuous work activity throughout the week. While Mr. Espree's original disputed claim asserted that the date of the injury was February 6, 2017, and the answer by Vanoil reflects a denial of the claim occurring on this date, his amended disputed claim for compensation, which was filed on March 7, 2018, asserted that the incident occurred on February 10, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Vanoil filed a motion for summary judgment on January 25, 2017. Following a July 30, 2018 hearing, the workers' compensation judge (WCJ) granted Vanoil's motion and signed a judgment that same day. However, the judgment, which was undated, merely stated that the motion for summary judgment was granted, without further decretal language, and was not designated as a final appealable judgment. Mr. Espree filed a petition for appeal, which was granted on September 13, 2018. On the lodging of the appeal, we filed a rule to show cause why the appeal should not be dismissed as having been taken from a judgment lacking proper decretal language. Our rule was withdrawn on the filing of an amended judgment from the WCJ, dated December 12, 2018, which included the proper decretal language, granting Vanoil's motion for summary judgment, and dismissing Mr. Espree's claim with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In this appeal, Mr. Espree asserts that the WCJ \"erred in granting Appellee's Motion for Summary Judgment because the Appellee's Motion did not prove that there was no genuine issue as to material fact, and that the mover is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the issue of whether Appellant suffered a work related accident.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Louisiana Code of Civil Procedure Article 966 provides that summary judgment procedure is favored and \"is designed to secure the just, speedy, and inexpensive determination of every action, except those disallowed by Article 969.\" La.Code Civ.P. art. 966(A)(2). It further provides that summary judgment \"shall be granted if the motion, memorandum, and supporting documents show that there is no genuine issue as to material fact and that the mover is entitled to judgment as a matter of\n   law.\" La.Code Civ.P. art. 966(A)(3). Although the burden of proof rests with the mover, if the mover will not bear the burden of proof at trial, then he need only point out to the trial court \"the absence of factual support for one or more elements essential to the adverse party's claim, action, or defense.\" La.Civ.Code art. 966(D)(1). Once this occurs, the burden shifts to \"the adverse party to produce factual support sufficient to establish the existence of a genuine issue of material fact or that the mover is not entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The supreme court in\n   <em>\n    Smitko v.

Vanoil offered a portion of Mr. Espree's deposition, in support of its motion for summary judgment, wherein he discussed how he was injured.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In his deposition, Mr. Espree stated that he was in pain on February 8 and 9, 2017, but he did not tell anyone with Vanoil about his pain until February 10, 2017, when he told Orell Daigle, Vanoil's quality assurance manager, that he was hurting and needed to see a doctor. He stated that he was unaware that he had suffered an injury until he saw the doctor, who sent him for x-rays and a CT scan. He said that he thought that his stomach and back pain were just age- and work-related. Mr. Espree stated that he felt that his work-related injury was related to a big job that he was working on the week of his injury, although he could point to no specific incident as the cause of his hernia. Although he stated that he did not overstrain, he later said that his doctor told him that he had overstrained.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   Mr. Espree stated:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   A. No. I didn't strain or nothing. It was just consistent - - I don't know the word I want to say.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   MR.

So basically what's going on is that you're doing repetitive type activities for a long time, for years - -\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   A.

Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   Q. - - what you believe is the accumulation of the years and years of you doing this repetitive type activity is what you believe caused you to have your hernia ?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   Q. All right. And that's why, when you went to the doctor on Monday, the - - what can we say, the 13th?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   A. Yeah.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   Q. - - the 13th, that is why at that point in time you, for the first time, realized that you had hurt yourself at work?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   A. Yeah.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   Q. And that's based on the doctor telling you that he was the repetitive wear and tear accumulation type situation?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   A. Yeah. He said that I had over strained.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   Q. Okay. Is there anything you would have brought me to that you think that any one thing that you did that you over strain on, or is it just this accumulation?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   A. Just accumulation. I don't have - - I didn't have two jobs. I only had one job.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   As Vanoil established the absence of factual support for one or more elements essential to Mr. Espree's claim, that an identifiable accident occurred, the burden shifted to Mr. Espree to produce factual support sufficient to establish a genuine issue of material fact as to whether he can prove that he suffered an accident, as defined by La.R.S. 23:1021(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In his affidavit, Mr. Espree stated the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   I was employed by Vanoil Completion Services for 16 years as a Press Operator and Hydrostatic Tester.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   My job duties included lifting, turning, and loading extremely heavy sections of pipe, called mandrels.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   The week of February 6 - 10, 2017, was extremely busy. I was working with 4 \u00bd BRO/SL2 Mandrels, which weigh approximately 800 pounds.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   I had to physically ram, by hand, a 40/50 pound piece of iron, called a \"running tool\" several times into the pocket or entry slot of the mandrel, to force/load a valve through that pocket to the end of the mandrel.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   On February 10, 2017, while I was ramming the running tool against the valve, I felt like I had a knife stabbing me in my lower abdomen and increased back pain. I took a break and then went to the bathroom for a brief rest.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   My brother, Christopher Espree, also an employee of Vanoil, saw me coming out of the bathroom, bent over in pain. He took over my job, as I could not perform my job duties anymore.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   Shortly thereafter, I informed Orell Daigle, the QA Manager at Vanoil, that I needed medical attention. Mr. Daigle instructed me to go to the doctor and get myself checked out.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Mr. Espree further submitted a portion of his deposition, which reads in part as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   Q .... Monday, the 6th, it is a seven on February the 7th, which is a Tuesday. What about on Wednesday, how is it then?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   A. At least a [sic] eight.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   Q. Okay. And then Thursday, what is the pain on the Thursday?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   A.

Yeah.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   Q. - - that's when it gets to a 10?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   A. Yeah. It got real bad.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   Q. All right. And on the Monday, when you started feeling these symptoms, did you communicate anything to the employer about symptoms or injury or accident or anything like that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   A. I called the - - the girl in the front, Amanda, and I told her I was feeling\n   real bad, and I needed to go to a doctor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   Q. All right. And when you say you told her you were \"feeling real bad\" - -\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   A. Yeah.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Mr. Espree also submitted the affidavit of his brother, Christopher Espree, who was also employed by Vanoil:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   I have been employed by Vanoil Completion Services for 14 years as a Robot Operator and Inside Diameter Grinder.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   The week of February 6 - 10, 2017, was extremely busy at Vanoil. We were trying to get out an order of 4 \u00bd BRO/SL2 Mandrels.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   I was sent to help my brother, Gilbert, with completing the order on February 10, 2017.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   Gilbert was working with a running tool, repeatedly ramming the valve through the hole in the mandrel. Each valve has to be rammed with the running tool 8 to 10 times. We were hurrying, trying to finish the last 20 mandrels to complete the order. While working with the running tool, Gilbert stopped suddenly and said, \"Hold up, hold up, I gotta take a break\" and grabbed his stomach. Gilbert leaned on the pipe rack and I could see that he was suddenly in excruciating pain. Then Gilbert walked to the bathroom. When Gilbert returned, I could see the pain on his face. I could tell that something had happened because he could no longer lift or push to help finish the job.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   I heard Gilbert tell Orell Daigle, the QA Manager at Vanoil, that he needed to go to the doctor. Orell replied, \"You need to go check yourself out.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Based on the evidence presented by Mr. Espree, we find that he has presented factual support sufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether he suffered a work-related accident. Despite Mr. Espree's deposition testimony regarding gradual wear and tear, there is evidence, based on his and his brother's affidavits, that he suffered an unexpected actual, identifiable, precipitous event, which happened suddenly or violently, and which directly produced objective findings of a periumbilical hernia. Although Mr. Espree could not point to a particular incident as evidence of an accident, his and his brother's affidavits both indicate that he began experiencing debilitating pain when he was physically ramming a forty to fifty pound piece of iron into the entry slot of an 800 pound piece of pipe.
