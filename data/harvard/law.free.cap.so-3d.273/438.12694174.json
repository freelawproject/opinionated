She claims that summary judgment should be reversed because there are questions of material fact concerning the fault of Jackie Green, a bus driver for the Lafayette Transit System. For the following reasons, we reverse the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On April 18, 2015, Ms. Smith-Asekomeh was a passenger on an LCG bus. Jackie Green was driving the bus on Lafayette Transit System Route #50. She had recently been hired by LCG as a driver so her supervisor, Jason Ledet, was on board the bus to train her. Mr. Ledet explained that they were in the process of route training Ms. Green. She initially trained without passengers, but on April 18 there were passengers on the bus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Mr. Ledet explained that Route #50 starts at the bus terminal. One of the stops is in the Walmart parking lot located on Buchanan Street. Ms. Smith-Asekomeh traveled on the bus to go to Walmart the afternoon of the incident at issue. She did some shopping at Walmart. After Ms. Smith-Asekomeh finished shopping, she got back on the same bus with several grocery bags. Ms. Smith-Asekomeh took the first forward facing seat behind the driver. There were two seats in front of her facing the aisle that could be flipped up to allow for handicap seating. Mr. Ledet was standing on the yellow line in the aisle in the front near the driver holding the post.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After the bus left Walmart, it made a right on Pierce Street. From Pierce Street, the bus would take a left onto Willow Street, which is where the incident took place. Ms. Smith-Asekomeh could not see what was happening because Mr. Ledet was standing in aisle, and the bus driver was seated in front of her. Mr. Ledet testified that they were at the red light in the left lane to turn left onto Willow. The turn lane does not have a green arrow light. When the light turned green, the bus proceeded to take a left.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Ms. Green had to put on her brakes to avoid a collision with a car coming from the opposite direction. Ms. Smith-Asekomeh testified she flew forward, her arm hit the armrest on the chair in front of her, and then she slammed back into her seat.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Ms. Smith-Asekomeh never reported to Ms. Green or Mr. Ledet that she was hurt. The bus continued its route. After she got off the bus, Ms. Smith-Asekomeh dropped her bags off at her house and then walked to her mother's house. Her mother called an ambulance. When the ambulance arrived, Ms. Smith-Asekomeh walked to it and got into the ambulance. Her mother rode with her to the emergency room. Ms. Smith-Asekomeh testified that she was in great pain the next day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Ms. Smith-Asekomeh filed suit against the LCG on October 26, 2015. On February 27, 2018, the LCG filed a motion for summary judgment. A hearing on the motion was held on October 29, 2018. The trial court granted the motion for summary judgment and dismissed Ms. Smith-Asekomeh's petition on November 8, 2018. Ms. Smith-Asekomeh then filed the present appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    SUMMARY JUDGMENT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Ms. Smith-Asekomeh claims the trial court erred in granting the LCG's motion for summary judgment. She argues that there are genuine issues of material fact regarding Ms. Green's fault in performing a left-hand turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The summary judgment procedure is favored and \"designed to secure the just, speedy, and inexpensive determination of every action[.]\" La.Code Civ.P. art. 966(A)(2). Appellate courts review the grant or denial of a motion for summary judgment de novo, \"using the same criteria that govern the trial court's determination of whether summary judgment is appropriate;\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , whether there is any genuine issue of material fact, and whether the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\"\n   <em>\n    Samaha v. Rau\n   </em>\n   , 07-1726, p. 4 (La. 2/26/08),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8391016\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/977/880/\">\n    977 So.2d 880\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 882-83 ; La.Code Civ.P. art. 966(A)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The moving party has the burden of proof unless the mover \"will not bear the burden of proof at trial on the issues that is before the court on the motion for summary judgment.\" La.Code Civ.P. art. 966(D)(1). In that case, the mover need only \"point out to the court the absence of factual support for one or more elements essential to the adverse party's claim, action, or defense. The burden is on the adverse party to produce factual support sufficient to establish the existence of a genuine issue of material fact or that the mover is not entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8391016\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/977/880/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \"The owner and operator of a public bus is considered a common carrier, and owes a heightened standard of care to the passengers he or she undertakes to transport.\"\n   <em>\n    Williams v.

The trial court also concluded that Ms. Green did not make a left turn in violation of La.R.S. 32:101.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Louisiana Revised Statutes 32:101(A)(2) provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    Left turns on two-way roadways.\n   </strong>\n   At any intersection where traffic is permitted to move in both directions on each roadway entering the intersection, an approach for a left turn shall be made in that portion of the right half of the roadway nearest the center line thereof and by passing to the right of such center line where it enters the intersection and after entering the intersection the left turn shall be made so as to leave the intersection to the right of the center line of the roadway being entered. Whenever practicable the left turn shall be made in that portion of the intersection to the left of the center of the intersection.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \"No person shall turn a vehicle at an intersection ... until such movement can be made with reasonable safety.\" La.R.S. 32:104(A).

Explaining, Ms. Green stated, \"I was going to make my turn, but I let him ... [g]o across first, but when I went, he went.\" She proceeded to make the turn, but the car on opposite side swerved his car at her. This is when she applied her brakes and let him proceed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Mr. Ledet knew the bus was stopped at the intersection before turning left, but could not recall if the light was red or green.
