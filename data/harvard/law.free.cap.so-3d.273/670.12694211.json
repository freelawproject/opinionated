Davis, Jr., was charged by bill of information with operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated (\"DWI\"), fourth offense, in violation of La. R.S. 14:98(D) and 14:98.4. Following a jury trial, the defendant was found guilty as charged. He was sentenced to serve 23 years at hard labor, with two years to be served without the benefit of parole, probation or suspension of sentence. He was also ordered to pay a $ 5,000 fine. Further, during the trial, the defendant was held in contempt of court seven times and was sentenced as follows: two six-month periods of confinement in the parish jail, each running consecutively to the sentence imposed for DWI; 10 days' confinement in the parish jail on each of the five remaining counts, for a total of 50 days, all consecutive\n   to any other sentences the defendant may be facing or serving.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   For the following reasons, we affirm the defendant's conviction and sentence for DWI, fourth offense. With regard to the findings of direct contempt, we reverse four findings of contempt, and we vacate the six-month period of confinement and three of the 10-day sentences imposed. The three remaining adjudications of contempt, and the sentences imposed therefor - one six-month sentence and two 10-day sentences - are affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   At the trial, the defendant opted to represent himself with the assistance of \"standby\" counsel. The following testimony was elicited at the trial: on May 15, 2016, Detective Logan McDonald and Corporal Jimmie Minor, of the Shreveport Police Department (\"SPD\"), were assigned to the radar unit of the traffic division. Det. McDonald was operating a stationary radar unit from the parking lot of a funeral home at the intersection of Jewella Avenue and Hollywood Avenue. Det. McDonald testified that he and Cpl. Minor were parked beside each other and they \"clocked\" the speed of vehicles as the vehicles traveled over a hill on Jewella Avenue. Det. McDonald also testified that his patrol vehicle was equipped with a Mobile Video System (\"MVS\"), which captures video and audio, and a \"two-piece\" radar unit, with a radar antenna in the front and rear of the vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Det. McDonald further testified as follows: he observed a pickup truck coming over the hill at a high rate of speed; he visually estimated that the vehicle was traveling at approximately 75 miles per hour (\"mph\") in a 40 mph speed zone; the radar unit confirmed the speed of the vehicle at 75 mph; he activated his lights and pulled out of the parking lot to conduct a traffic stop; both he and the defendant pulled into the parking lot of a gas station located nearby; when he approached the defendant's truck, he detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from the inside of the vehicle; he asked the defendant to exit the truck to verify the source of the odor of alcohol; he detected that the odor was coming from the defendant; he also observed that the defendant was unsteady on his feet, swaying, and his speech was slurred; it took the defendant several minutes to produce his driver's license and proof of insurance; he advised the defendant of his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights and asked him to perform field sobriety tests; he administered the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus (\"HGN\") test and the ABC/Divided Attention test; the defendant performed poorly on the HGN test; he noted nystagmus (jerking activity) in the defendant's eyes; the defendant was unable to follow the pen with his eyes; the defendant performed poorly on the ABC test and was unable to recite the alphabet from A to Z; he observed the defendant \"swaying\" throughout the tests; the defendant's performance on the field sobriety tests indicated that he was intoxicated; the MVS in his police vehicle was activated at the time of the traffic stop and recorded the encounter;\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   he placed the defendant under arrest and transported him to the police station; when they arrived at the police station, he escorted the defendant to the \"DWI interview room,\" where DWI suspects are usually taken, advised the defendant of his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights, including his rights in connection with blood alcohol and Breathalyzer testing; the room contains a\n   camera that recorded the interaction between him and the defendant; the defendant refused to undergo additional field sobriety and the Intoxilyzer testing; and he placed the defendant under arrest for DWI, fourth offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Corporal Jimmie Minor, who is employed in SPD's traffic division, testified as follows: on the evening of May 15, 2016; he was positioned in the parking lot of a funeral home at the corner of Hollywood and Jewella Avenues; he was \"running radar\" with Det. McDonald; he assisted Det. McDonald when he executed the traffic stop of the defendant; he exited his patrol unit when he noticed there was a passenger in the defendant's truck; and his only involvement with the defendant was when he moved the defendant's truck after the defendant was placed under arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Sergeant Danny Duddy, a supervisor with the SPD's Crime Scene Investigation Unit, testified at trial as an expert in the field of fingerprint identification and comparison. Sgt. Duddy testified that he compared fingerprints from three April 21, 2014 convictions (Caddo Parish District Court docket numbers 311200, 311388, and 321995), for DWI first offense, of a defendant named Dennis R. Davis, Jr., with fingerprints obtained from the defendant in the courtroom. Sgt. Duddy concluded that the defendant was the same person convicted in the three prior offenses in 2014.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   He also testified that each conviction reflected in the state's exhibits was within ten years of May 15, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The defendant was the only witness to testify for the defense. He testified as follows: he was not drinking on the night of May 15, 2016; he had not consumed alcohol in the 48 hours prior to being stopped by the police officers; he did not refuse the sobriety tests offered by Det. McDonald; he did not exhibit signs of intoxication when he was stopped; his eyes were not glossy, his balance was not unsteady, his breath did not smell like alcohol, and he did not stagger or fall during the traffic stop; and he was not traveling at 75 mph when he was stopped.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   During the defendant's testimony, he introduced into evidence an amended bill of information for Caddo Parish District Court docket number 32214, which charged him with DWI, second offense on May 5, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   After deliberating, the jury found the defendant guilty as charged of DWI, fourth offense. He was sentenced to serve 23 years in prison at hard labor, two of those years to be served without the benefit of parole, probation or suspension of sentence. He was also ordered to pay a $ 5,000 fine. Additionally, during the trial, the defendant was held in contempt of court seven times and was sentenced as follows: two six-month confinements in the parish jail, each running consecutively to the other sentences imposed; 10 days' confinement in the parish jail on each of the remaining five counts, for a total of 50 days, all to run consecutive to \"any other sentence the defendant may be facing or\n   serving.\" Subsequently, the trial court denied the defendant's pro se motion to reconsider sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The defendant appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The defendant contends the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction for DWI, fourth offense. He argues as follows: the state failed to produce any evidence to show his blood alcohol level; the state relied on circumstantial evidence and \"innocuous observations\" to prove that he was intoxicated; his alleged swaying and slurred speech could have been caused by another reason, such as standing on his feet all day while wearing boots; Det. McDonald had no baseline to observe how the defendant normally reacted after working all day; the perceived redness in his eyes could have been caused by working all day in the elements; the police officers \"allegedly\" stopped him for speeding, which is not an indication of intoxication; there was no testimony that he was driving erratically or swerving; the odor of alcohol, alone, does not prove intoxication; Det. McDonald's testimony that he had \"odor on the breath\" could not be verified by the jury because the jury could not smell the odor just by viewing the videotape; and the state did not exclude every reasonable hypothesis of innocence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The standard of appellate review for a sufficiency of the evidence claim is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\n   <em>\n    Jackson v.

McDonald opined that the defendant was intoxicated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Further, the video and audio recordings introduced into evidence confirmed Det. McDonald's testimony. A review of those recordings reveals that the defendant was unable to recite the alphabet while he was on the scene of the arrest and that he was swaying while attempting to perform the field sobriety tests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   It is apparent from the verdict that the jury found the testimony of Det. McDonald to be credible. In addition, the jury was able to view the video evidence of the defendant's arrest. After reviewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, we find that the record supports the jury's finding of guilt. Further, the evidence of record excluded every reasonable hypothesis of innocence. The jury had sufficient evidence to conclude that the defendant was driving while intoxicated. This assignment lacks merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The defendant also contends the trial court erred in denying his motion for a new trial. He argues that he was entitled to a new trial because the verdict rendered was \"contrary to the law and/or the evidence in that the prosecution failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant committed the crime.\" La. C. Cr. P. art. 851(B)(1). Further, the defendant argues that the trial court used the \"sufficiency of the evidence\" standard, as set forth in\n   <em>\n    Jackson v. Virginia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , to deny his motion for a new trial, rather than reviewing the matter as the \"thirteenth juror,\" as set forth in\n   <em>\n    Tibbs v.

First, when the trial court issued its ruling, defendant did not object on the ground that the court applied the wrong standard. Thus, procedurally he is barred from advancing this argument on appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   LSA-C.Cr.P. art. 841. Moreover, the record does not support defendant's claim that the court applied the wrong standard. The court's comments were brief and do not indicate that the court applied the standards of LSA-C.Cr.P. article 821 in ruling on the motion for new trial.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   In the instant case, the trial court ruled on the defendant's motions for a new trial and post-verdict judgment of acquittal simultaneously. In doing so, the court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   Pursuant to La. C. Cr. P. art. 851(B)(2), the motion for a new trial is denied. Under La. C. Cr. P. art. 851(B)(1), the court does believe that there was sufficient evidence for a reasonable trier of fact under\n   <em>\n    Jackson v.

So I will deny both motions by defense counsel at this time for the reasons orally stated.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Our review of the record reveals that the trial court summarily denied the defendant's motion for new trial without providing reasons. With regard to the defendant's motion for post-verdict judgment of acquittal, the court correctly applied the\n   <em>\n    Jackson v. Virginia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , standard of review. The court also addressed the arguments the defendant urged in his motion for new trial and stated that it had reviewed the evidence, including the evidence and arguments the defendant raised during the course of the trial. We find that the trial court did not err in denying the defendant's motions. This assignment lacks merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The defendant also contends his sentence was constitutionally excessive. He argues that the prior felonies he committed were non-violent offenses, all of which involved some form of substance abuse. Further, the defendant maintains that there was no victim to his crime and his driving while intoxicated did not cause harm to others.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   When reviewing an excessive sentence claim, the appellate court uses a two-prong test. First, the trial record must demonstrate that the trial court complied with La. C. Cr. P. art. 894.1.

C. Cr. P. art. 894.1. The court noted that it had reviewed the defendant's presentence investigation report, particularly observing the defendant's lengthy and detailed criminal history, which included multiple prior arrests for DWI, five of which had occurred within the last five years.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court further stated that the defendant's criminal history indicated that he possessed a disregard for the consequences that his criminal behavior may present for others and a \"disregard for any interest in addressing what may be going on at the root of the problem.\" Additionally, the court stated, \"[T]he Court sympathizes with people with a drinking problem; it does not sympathize with people with a drinking and driving problem[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Further, the court noted the following aggravating factors: the defendant created a risk of death or great bodily harm to more than one person by driving, while\n   intoxicated, at a speed of more than 35 mph over the speed limit; and the defendant utilized a dangerous weapon by operating a motor vehicle at a high rate of speed while \"profoundly impaired.\" Further, prior to imposing the sentence, the court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   The Court does believe that [the defendant] has shown an absolute lack of any remorse or notion that he bears any responsibility whatsoever for operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated so many times, in such a short period of time. * * * [T]he Court believes that the lack of remorse coupled with the short time period in which all of these DWI convictions were amassed - 2012, 2014, 2014, 2015, 2016 - shows a pattern of indifference towards the consequences of drunk driving.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Additionally, the court stated that the defendant's numerous DWI convictions \"suggests to the Court that nothing short of incarceration would keep [the defendant] from driving, whether he's licensed, allowed to do so, ordered not to do so, or not.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   With regard to mitigating factors, the court noted that the defendant's criminal conduct did not cause actual harm to others. The court also noted that the defendant's incarceration would present a hardship to his family and his business. However, the court observed that there was no evidence in the record that the defendant had voluntarily participated in any substance abuse program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   After reviewing the record in its entirety, it is clear that the trial court considered the factors embodied in La. C. Cr. P. art. 894.1. At the time the defendant committed the offense, the maximum sentence for a fourth offense DWI was 30 years in prison and a $ 5,000 fine. La. R.S. 14:98.4. The defendant's sentence of 23 years falls within that statutory sentencing range. Furthermore, as the trial court noted, the defendant has numerous arrests for DWI and has committed multiple traffic violations while operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated. The defendant has clearly demonstrated that he has a disregard for the law.

During the course of the trial and sentencing, the trial court held the defendant in contempt on seven separate occasions. The contempt adjudications were as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   <em>\n    First Contempt Adjudication\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   During Sgt. Duddy's testimony, the defendant objected to the admission of evidence of his prior DWI convictions. When asked about the grounds for his objection, the defendant began to speak about other matters after the trial court had repeatedly admonished that he could not testify at that time. Thereafter, the trial court excused the jury, and the following colloquy took place:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   COURT: Mr. Davis, I find you in contempt of court. I have ordered you not to testify. You have the right to testify and be subject to cross-examination; but you do not have the right, in the form of question or argument, to testify about events outside of the courtroom. Do you have anything in mitigation of your contempt?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n   DEFENDANT: I do because the state is offering these frivolous papers based on a time when I was a free man --\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n   COURT: Do you have anything to offer in mitigation of your contempt?

I will determine sentencing at the conclusion of this trial.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   We find that the trial court did not err with regard to the first contempt adjudication. The court informed the defendant that he had the right to testify, but he could not testify during arguments regarding events outside of the courtroom. The court then afforded the defendant the opportunity to be heard by way of mitigation. Accordingly, we find that the trial court substantially complied with the provisions set forth in La. C. Cr. P. art. 22 with regard to the first finding of direct contempt. We affirm the contempt adjudication and the 10-day sentence imposed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   <em>\n    Second Contempt Adjudication\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   The trial court held the defendant in contempt for the second time by stating, \"[T]he Court would also potentially consider that to be an additional contempt of court, because of the number of times I've had to admonish you about holding up documents.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   We find that the second contempt adjudication did not comply with La. C. Cr. P. art 22. A statement that the court would \"potentially consider\" the defendant to be in contempt of court does not constitute a direct order of contempt. Further, the court did not afford the defendant \"an opportunity to be heard orally by way of defense or mitigation.\" See\n   <em>\n    State v. Woodard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   .

It also argued that the documents were not relevant and the defendant had not established a proper foundation for the introduction of the documents. The trial court explained the rules of evidence and criminal procedure to the defendant and asked the defendant why the documents had not been made available to the state during discovery. The defendant replied, \"I don't care what you do, man. F*ck it. You're going to deny it anyways. Go on. F*ck it. Go on deny it.\" The court held the defendant in contempt, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-110\">\n   All right. He's just used profanity. I want the record to show that. Sir, I am trying to treat you with all the dignity to which you are entitled, but you are showing an obstreperous refusal to comply with the law. You have refused to comply with discovery, under Article 724 and 725, despite my repeated warnings that you don't know the law and that it could cause problems in your efforts to\n   represent yourself. And despite my patience in providing you with standby counsel to answer your questions and try to help you through that, every time I ask you a question or talk to you about it, you tell me that you know better and you refuse to answer my question.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-111\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-112\">\n   And by the way, you are in contempt of court for your outburst, but we'll deal with that later.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-113\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Within minutes of the third adjudication of contempt, the defendant continued to argue with the trial court and repeatedly interrupted the court during the court's instructions. The court again attempted to explain trial procedure to the defendant. The colloquy is as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-115\">\n   DEFENDANT: The court should have made availability to Mr. Prudhomme and told him to -\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-116\">\n   COURT: No sir, you fired Mr. Prudhomme.

The court attempted to explain to the defendant the rules of evidence and trial procedure. The court then afforded the defendant the opportunity to be heard by way of mitigation. Accordingly, we find that the trial court substantially complied with the provisions set forth in La. C. Cr. P. art. 22 with regard to the third and fourth findings of direct contempt. Consequently, we affirm the third and fourth adjudications of contempt and the six-month and 10-day sentences imposed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   <em>\n    Fifth Contempt Adjudication\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   During the defendant's cross-examination testimony, the state began to question him with regard to certain aspects of his business operations,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , his ability to review documents, write checks, paying employees, etc. The defendant objected to the line of questioning. When the state attempted to offer an explanation for the questions, the defendant interrupted the assistant district attorney. The trial court excused the jury and admonished the defendant with regard to his repeated interruptions of the court and the assistant district attorney. When the defendant interrupted the court during its remarks, the court held him in contempt, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-135\">\n   I find you in contempt of court for violating my repeated orders for you to not interrupt; and I will conduct sentencing at the conclusion of the trial on your fourth contempt citation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   The trial court did not provide the defendant an opportunity to be heard or the opportunity to offer evidence in defense or mitigation of his actions. Consequently, we reverse the fifth adjudication of contempt, and we hereby vacate the 10-day sentence imposed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   <em>\n    Sixth Adjudication of Contempt\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Following the defendant's conviction, a hearing was conducted on post-trial motions. During the hearing, the defendant objected to the admission of the bills of information from his prior DWI cases, stating that the bills of information were \"counterfeit,\" and \"frivolous and phony.\" The trial court admonished the defendant regarding \"arguing the facts,\" rather than stating a factual basis for his allegations.

On March 16, 2017, the trial court denied the motion with regard to false imprisonment and denial of bail, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-157\">\n   Defendant argues that he is being held without cause and without bond.

Further, a bond was set, and the defendant failed to post bail. Thereafter, the trial court conducted a hearing and determined that probable cause existed to charge the defendant with the aforementioned offense. This assignment lacks merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   The defendant's next argument appears to stem from the trial court's denial of his motion to suppress. He contends the police officers lacked grounds to conduct the traffic stop which led to his arrest. He argues that the SPD has a history of stopping African American citizens who drive expensive vehicles. According to the defendant, the vehicle he was operating at the time of his arrest was valued at $ 80,000, and was \"loaded with tools on the back.\" Further, the defendant argues that\n   the state did not offer any proof that he was speeding because the reading from the radar detector was not introduced into evidence at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   The law with regard to traffic stops is well settled.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Police officers are authorized to enforce traffic laws governing the operation of vehicles and pedestrians upon all public highways located within the state of Louisiana.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   La.

The defendant did not present any evidence to demonstrate that the traffic stop was pretextual.
