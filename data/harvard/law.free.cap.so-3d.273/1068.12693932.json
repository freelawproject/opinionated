Included in Evans' petition are claims that appellate counsel (1) failed to raise several instances of trial counsel's ineffective assistance; and (2) failed to raise an unpreserved error (the trial court's failure to provide the jury with a written version of the final instructions delivered orally to the jury).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   We deny the petition, as each of Evans' asserted claims is without merit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gomez v.
