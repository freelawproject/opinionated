We have jurisdiction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because the evidence supports the trial court's finding that Appellants waived their right to arbitration, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Appellee, Gail Boylan, lived at the Allegro at Harbour Island assisted living facility for slightly more than one month. She sued the facility's owner, management company, and administrator (collectively \"Appellants\") for negligence and breach of fiduciary duty after suffering injuries from a fall during her stay at the facility. Appellants timely filed a motion to abate and compel arbitration based on an arbitration provision in Boylan's resident agreement with the facility. Pursuant to the parties' stipulation, the trial court entered an order authorizing the parties to conduct limited discovery regarding arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   However, in a subsequent deposition of Appellee's daughter and attorney-in-fact, Appellants' counsel asked numerous questions that went to the merits of the underlying case. As a result, the trial court properly found that the deposition \"cover[ed] matters extrinsic to the limited scope permitted by this Court's Order ... and consequently was inconsistent with the right to arbitrate.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \"The right to arbitration, like any contract right, can be waived.\"\n   <em>\n    Raymond James Fin.
