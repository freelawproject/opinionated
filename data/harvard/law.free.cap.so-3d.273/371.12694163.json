Appellants P &amp; G, LLC; Marsha Jones; and Anne Livaudais (collectively \"P &amp; G\") seek review of the trial court's judgment denying P &amp; G's demand to name it owner of certain batture and granting Appellees' reconventional demand\n   declaring Shingle Point, LLC and First Equity, Inc. (collectively \"Shingle Point\") the owners of the batture.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Finding no error in the trial court's ruling, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The disputed batture is located on land formerly known as the Harlem Plantation, which is situated on the east bank of Plaquemines Parish.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On June 28, 1946, John and Florian Lopez (hereinafter \"the Lopez Brothers\") acquired Harlem Plantation from Terrebonne Land Development Corporation. Later that year, the Lopez Brothers commissioned J.C. DeArmas, Jr., to prepare a survey (hereinafter the \"DeArmas Survey\") subdividing the land into individual lots. Between 1947 and 1951, the Lopez Brothers sold several of these lots and partitioned the remaining lots amongst themselves. On January 14, 1952, Florian Lopez sold his half, on which the lots and batture relevant to the case\n   <em>\n    sub judice\n   </em>\n   are located, to Charles S. Potter (hereinafter \"Mr. Potter\"). The act of sale between Mr. Potter and Florian Lopez stated that the \"tract of land hereby conveyed fronts on the Mississippi River, and this sale covers and includes all battures, accretions, and all riparian rights which appertain or belong to said tract of land.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Between 1952 and 1958, Mr. Potter sold several individual lots. Some of the acts of sale contained specific language transferring riparian rights and batture, while other acts of sale contained no such language.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Through a series of subsequent transactions, Shingle Point ultimately became owner of the lots relevant to this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   P &amp; G filed the instant petitory action alleging ownership of batture emanating from the 1952 act of sale between Florian Lopez and Mr. Potter. In response, Shingle Point filed a reconventional demand seeking to be adjudged the owner of the batture. At trial, the parties stipulated that the acts of sale described the relevant lots as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Lot is designated by Number 1 on the plan of Harlem Subdivision by John de Armas, 1946, according to which said plan of subdivision, the said lot measures 192 feet, front on Mississippi River.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   P &amp; G argues the DeArmas Survey does not reflect the lots' boundary lines as going to the river and that it separately reflects the batture as bounded on all four sides (hereinafter the \"DeArmas Line\"). P &amp; G further maintains that, in the absence of express language granting title to the batture, Mr. Potter retained the batture when the lots were sold.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Following the trial, the trial court ruled in favor of Shingle Point, declaring it owner of the batture and dismissing P &amp; G's claims. While it considered testimony from several lay witnesses who testified regarding the height of the batture at the time of\n   the acts of sale, the trial court ultimately accepted and adopted the conclusion of Mr. Stephen Estopinal (hereinafter \"Mr. Estopinal), Shingle Point's expert in land surveying. In its written reasons for judgment, the trial court found Mr. Estopinal's testimony credible, citing his opinion that the use of the phrase \"front on the river\" evidenced intent to sell all lands up to the Mississippi River. The trial court also cited Mr. Estopinal's testimony regarding the custom of using a meander line stopping at a river road rather than at the river itself. Further, the trial court adopted Mr. Estopinal's opinion that batture was excluded from the sale only if it was specifically excluded. Conversely, when the acts of sale were silent, batture was automatically included.

Accretion formed successively and imperceptibly on the bank of a river is called alluvion. La. C.C. art. 499. Batture refers to lands of alluvial origin formed by imperceptible deposits of material - it has the same meaning as accretion. 2 LA. CIV. L. TREATISE, PROPERTY \u00a7 5:9 (5th ed.). Louisiana jurisprudence regarding land at the water's edge dates back to the nineteenth century and involves property transfers taking place as early as the eighteenth century.\n   <em>\n    Barbera v.

The early cases held that where an estate is bounded by the Mississippi River or is described as fronting on the river, then it is understood to include the rights to any alluvion that may form, at the same time being subject to any diminution from erosion of the banks.\n   <em>\n    Morgan v.

Considering the expert and lay testimony, the trial court found the disputed batture never formed of sufficient height to be susceptible to separate ownership during the relevant time period.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Shingle Point's survey expert, Mr. Estopinal, testified that the phrase \"front on the river\" is understood to mean that an act of sale was meant to grant all property, including the batture, up to the river. Similarly, P &amp; G's survey expert, Jay Dufrene (hereinafter \"Mr. Dufrene\"), acknowledged that, standing on its own, the phrase means the lots would go up to the river. This interpretive concept has been recognized by our Supreme Court for two hundred years.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Morgan\n   </em>\n   , 6 Mart.

As will be discussed subsequently in this opinion, such evidence also assists in the interpretation of the boundaries on the DeArmas Survey.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Further probative of whether the batture was of sufficient height was that it\n   was not indicated as a separate lot or otherwise separately labeled.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Morgan,\n   </em>\n   6 Mart.

Mr. Estopinal testified this was because the land was not useable. Isaac Gregorie, Jr., Shingle Point's title expert, corroborated Mr. Estopinal's opinion that if the batture was intended to be a separate parcel of land, it would have been indicated as such on the DeArmas Survey. Similarly, on direct questioning from the trial court, Mr. Estopinal stated the \"front on the river\" language was sufficient to transfer the batture in the partition between the Lopez Brothers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   As the Lopez Brothers originally commissioned the DeArmas Survey, their partition would have used express language transferring batture to Florian if the height and magnitude of the batture so required. Likewise, Lee Miller, P &amp; G's title expert, conceded that express language was not required to transfer the batture in the Lopez Brothers' partition; otherwise, Florian would not have been able to subsequently sell the batture to Mr. Potter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The lines on a survey are not always indicative of the actual boundary lines of a piece of property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Estopinal explained that it was the customary practice for surveyors to make use of meander lines. According to Mr. Estopinal, meander lines do not indicate the actual boundary but are instead drawn to the edge of usable dry land. This practice was extremely common given the difficulties in surveying batture due to its marshy nature. Mr. Dufrene acknowledged this custom and further admitted he did not know why the DeArmas Line was drawn where it was. He also conceded that Mr. Estopinal had more experience than him in surveying lands on the east bank of Plaquemines Parish.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In light of the above testimony and evidence, we find the trial court did not err in determining no express language was required to effectuate the transfer of the batture. Implicit in its judgment is a finding that, at the relevant time period, the batture was not of sufficient elevation above the water in such a way as to give it a reasonable appearance of permanence. The trial court, relying on Mr. Estopinal's testimony, noted the lack of usable land between the meander line on the DeArmas Survey and the low water mark of the river. It is the province of the trial court to weigh the evidence and to make a factual determination on the susceptibility of batture to separate ownership.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cochran v.

Use of the term \"front on the river,\" the practice of using meander lines, and the fact that the batture was not specifically indicated as a separate lot, served as the basis for his expert opinion. These customs are in accord with the aforementioned legal guidelines for determining boundaries: natural monuments outrank artificial monuments.\n   <em>\n    Meyer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"578038\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/la/147/851/#p857\">\n    86 So. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   309 ;\n   <em>\n    Morgan\n   </em>\n   , 6 Mart.

The trial court, in assessing the credibility of the experts, chose to accept the testimony of Mr. Estopinal. Our review of the record confirms the trial court was within its discretion in making this factual determination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Morris\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7516348\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/584/729/#p731\">\n    584 So.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   730-31 (citing\n   <em>\n    Rosell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   ). We find this argument without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   P &amp; G also maintains the trial court erred by not considering Mr. Potter's intent in interpreting the acts of sale. P &amp; G asserts the express language used in some of the acts of sale evidences Mr. Potter's intent, as a savvy real estate developer, not to sell the batture on the remaining lots at issue - it was an intentional decision on his part to omit its transfer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Contrary to P &amp; G's contention, we find the trial court did take Mr. Potter's intent into consideration. As Mr. Estopinal explained, determining the intention of a seller requires consideration of the language of an act of sale. Mr. Estopinal further elaborated that one cannot perform a survey unless they review the title. P &amp; G acknowledged that the \"front on the river\" language was a holdover from prior transactions. Mr. Estopinal considered this language to indicate Mr. Potter's intent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Morgan\n   </em>\n   , 6 Mart.

As an experienced real estate developer, Mr. Potter would have removed this language to reflect a different intent. Further, Mr. Potter's daughter, Mrs. Marion Giardina, admitted she did not necessarily know what her father's intent was when he sold the lots given that she was relatively young at the time. Accordingly, we find this argument without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    DECREE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   For the foregoing reasons we affirm the judgment of the trial court dismissing the petitory action of P &amp; G and declaring Shingle Point as owner of the batture at issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    Marion Giardina (hereinafter \"Mrs. Giardina\"), sole member of P &amp; G, was voluntarily dismissed from the litigation as a party plaintiff on her own motion.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    At trial, the acts of sale from these transactions were submitted into evidence as joint exhibits.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    Mr. DeArmas' name is styled in varying ways in the pleadings, acts of sale, and other documents in the record.
