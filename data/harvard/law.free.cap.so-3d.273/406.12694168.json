Carpenter (collectively, \"Plaintiffs\") appeal the trial court's September 7, 2018 judgment granting the Motion for Summary Judgment filed by appellees, Treymark Properties, LLC (\"Treymark\") and Mark Morice (collectively, \"Defendants\"). The lawsuit arises from injuries sustained by Mr. Ferguson when he slipped and fell off the roof of a house at 3125-27 Jena Street in New Orleans, which was allegedly owned and maintained by Defendants. When he fell, Mr. Ferguson was helping a friend, Brett Newkirk, who had been hired by Defendants to patch the roof of the house. We find genuine issues of material fact as to whether Mr. Ferguson was a trespasser or an invitee on the Defendants' property when he slipped and fell, and whether the dangerous condition of the roof was open and obvious. Accordingly, we reverse the trial court's judgment and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On September 19, 2016, Mr. Ferguson and Mr. Newkirk were repairing the tile roof of the house, which had a very steep slope. Mr. Newkirk slipped and fell 23 feet from the roof, landing on a concrete sidewalk. After Mr. Ferguson heard Mr. Newkirk scream and went to help him, Mr. Ferguson also slipped and fell off the roof at the same spot as Mr. Newkirk. As a result of his fall to the concrete below, Mr. Ferguson had multiple surgeries and had one leg amputated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On July 21, 2017, Plaintiffs filed suit against Defendants alleging that Defendants failed to maintain the premises in a reasonably safe condition and failed to generally exercise due care. Additionally, the Petition alleged: (1) failure to discover an unreasonably dangerous condition; (2) failure to correct the condition or warn of its existence; (3) failure to warn plaintiff of the defect; and (4) failure to act as a responsible and prudent person under the circumstances. The Petition asserted that Defendants knew, or in the exercise of reasonable care, should have known, of the \"vice or defect\" in the roof.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On May 9, 2018, Defendants filed a Motion for Summary Judgment asserting that the roof was not unreasonably dangerous and that Defendants did not owe a duty to Ferguson. The hearing on the Motion for Summary Judgment was held on September 7, 2018, after which the trial court granted Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment and dismissed Plaintiffs' claims against Defendants, with prejudice. The trial court found that Plaintiffs could not satisfy their burden at trial of proving that the roof was unreasonably dangerous or that Defendants owed a duty to protect Plaintiffs from the harm they allegedly sustained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiffs list three assignments of error:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   (1) Genuine issues of material fact exist which preclude summary judgment;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   (2) There are case-specific issues as to whether there was an unreasonable risk of harm, such that Defendants failed to meet their burden on summary judgment under the \"open and obvious\" doctrine;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   (3) The trial court erred by failing to make reasonable inferences viewed in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   We apply a\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   standard of review in examining a trial court's ruling on summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    Hare v.

According to Plaintiffs, Mr. Ferguson was invited by Mr. Morice to voluntarily assist Mr. Newkirk in repairing the roof. Plaintiffs assert that while Mr. Newkirk and Mr. Ferguson were driving to the property, Mr. Newkirk answered a phone call from Mr. Morice, and reminded him that Mr. Ferguson would be helping with the repairs by acting as a \"gofer.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs contend that Mr. Morice consented.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Mr. Morice, on the other hand, contends that Mr. Ferguson was trespassing, and he had no knowledge that Mr. Ferguson was on the roof.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Before 1976, Louisiana jurisprudence created a strict series of categories classifying persons entering land belonging to another. The comprehensive classification scheme defined a landowner's duty to entrants injured on the premises because of unreasonably dangerous conditions. The three main classes developed were \"trespasser,\" \"licensee,\" and \"invitee,\" and the scope of the duty owed by the landowner to the entrant varied depending on the status accorded the entrant.

The only evidence submitted by Defendants in support of their motion for summary judgment was an affidavit by Mark Morice, the manager of Treymark Properties, LLC, in which Mr. Morice attested in pertinent part: (1) the roof was \"very steep\" and was made of tiles; (2) previously, no one had fallen off the roof of the property located at 3125-7 Jena; and (3) \"Fergusons [sic] slip and fall off the roof could not have been anticipated by Defendants nor prevented by Defendants.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In my opinion, Defendants failed to meet their burden of proof; thus, the burden never shifted to Plaintiffs pursuant to La. C.C.P. art. 966(D). Consequently, Defendants are not entitled to summary judgment in their favor as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    An invitee is \"a person who goes on the premises with the express or implied invitation of the occupant on the business of the latter or for their mutual advantage.\" A \"trespasser\" is defined as \"one who enters the premises without the permission of the occupier or without a legal right to do so.\"\n    <em>\n     Butcher v.
