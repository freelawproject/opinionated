The Appellant, Justo Roque, Jr., appeals the district court's judgment affirming the decision of the administrative law judge (\"ALJ\") that the Department of Children and Family Services (\"DCFS\") correctly determined the amount of his benefit under the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (\"SNAP\"). For the reasons that follow, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In early 2017, DCFS advised Mr. Roque, who was receiving a SNAP benefit, that he was required to recertify his eligibility. In response, Mr. Roque completed a re-enrollment form. Based on the information provided, DCFS approved Mr. Roque's re-enrollment. DCFS also informed him that it had determined his SNAP benefit would be $ 82 per month.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Challenging the determination, Mr. Roque requested an administrative hearing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   After the hearing, the ALJ affirmed the determination. Mr. Roque petitioned the district court for review of the ALJ's decision.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   After a hearing, the district court affirmed the ALJ's decision. This appeal followed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Judicial review of DCFS' SNAP benefit determinations is governed by the Louisiana Administrative Procedure Act, La. R.S. 49:950,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (\"APA\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   La. R.S. 46:107(D) (providing that \"all adjudicatory and review proceedings under this Section shall be governed by the [APA]\"). Under the APA, the standard of judicial review is as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   [A reviewing court] may affirm the decision of the agency or remand the case for further proceedings. The court may reverse or modify the decision if substantial rights of the appellant have been prejudiced because the administrative findings, inferences, conclusions, or decisions are:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   (1) In violation of constitutional or statutory provisions;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   (2) In excess of the statutory authority of the agency;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   (3) Made upon unlawful procedure;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   (4) Affected by other error of law;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   (5) Arbitrary or capricious or characterized by abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted exercise of discretion; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   (6) Not supported and sustainable by a preponderance of evidence as determined by the reviewing court. In the application of this rule, the court\n   shall make its own determination and conclusions of fact by a preponderance of evidence based upon its own evaluation of the record reviewed in its entirety upon judicial review. In the application of the rule, where the agency has the opportunity to judge the credibility of witnesses by first-hand observation of demeanor on the witness stand and the reviewing court does not, due regard shall be given to the agency's determination of credibility issues.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   La. R.S. 49:964(G).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Before addressing Mr. Roque's arguments on appeal, we find it appropriate to discuss the statutory and regulatory framework of SNAP. Under SNAP, funds appropriated by Congress are disbursed to the states, which in turn distribute the funds to qualifying households pursuant to federal regulations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Congress has authorized the states to adopt a simplified SNAP for households with elderly or disabled members who are eligible to receive Supplemental Security Income (\"SSI\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Louisiana has adopted a simplified SNAP, called the Louisiana Combined Application Project (\"LaCAP\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Under LaCAP, SNAP benefits are determined using a three-tiered framework.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Each qualifying applicant is assigned to a tier based on the applicant's shelter costs (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , housing and utility costs), and each tier provides a standard benefit amount.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Mr. Roque applied for, and is receiving, his SNAP benefit under LaCAP.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The gist of Mr. Roque's argument on appeal is that, in determining his SNAP benefit under LaCAP, DCFS was required, but failed, to consider his actual monthly utility and medical expenses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Roque contends that DCFS' failure to consider his actual monthly expenses resulted in an erroneous tier assignment and, by extension, an insufficient benefit, which prejudiced his substantial rights. Thus, he contends, the ALJ's decision affirming DCFS' determination should be reversed. We consider Mr. Roque's arguments regarding his utility and medical expenses separately.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    Utility Expenses\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Federal SNAP Act allows states that have adopted a simplified SNAP to use a Standard Utility Allowance (\"SUA\"), rather than considering actual utility expenses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Indeed, the Federal SNAP Act confers on such states the authority to make the use of an SUA mandatory.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Consistent with these provisions, Louisiana has mandated the use of an SUA for households that incur heating or cooling expenses separate and apart from their rent or mortgage.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In his re-enrollment form, Mr. Roque represented that he incurs heating and cooling expenses separate and apart from his rent. Thus, in determining Mr. Roque's LaCAP tier assignment, DCFS was required to consider only the SUA, rather than Mr. Roque's actual utility expenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    Medical Expenses\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Federal SNAP Act permits consideration only of medical expenses exceeding $ 35 per month.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   During the administrative hearing, DCFS offered\n   pharmacy receipts provided by Mr. Roque establishing that his monthly medical expenses are $ 11.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because Mr. Roque's monthly medical expenses do not exceed $ 35, DCFS was not permitted to consider such expenses in determining Mr. Roque's LaCAP tier assignment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In sum, DCFS' determination of Mr. Roque's SNAP benefit under LaCAP violated no statutory provision and, thus, did not prejudice his substantial rights. To the contrary, DCFS correctly determined Mr. Roque's SNAP benefit. Mr. Roque pays $ 136 per month in rent; the SUA is $ 353 per month-making Mr. Roque's monthly combined shelter cost $ 489.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, DCFS correctly assigned Mr. Roque to the second LaCAP tier, for which the standard benefit is $ 82 per month.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     DECREE\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the district court's judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20273.15\">\n     7 C.F.R. \u00a7 273.15\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a) (providing that \"each State agency shall provide a fair hearing to any household aggrieved by any action of the State agency which affects the participation of the household in [SNAP]\"); La.

Mr. Roque initially filed his petition for review in the 19th JDC. Subsequently, he filed a motion requesting that the case be transferred to the Civil District Court for the Parish of Orleans (\"CDC\")-the district court of Mr. Roque's domicile.
