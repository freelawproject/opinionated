Lopez's motion is facially insufficient because the motion is not under oath and otherwise fails to contain the contents required by rule 3.801(c). As the State properly and commendably concedes, however, the trial court erred by denying Lopez's motion without giving him leave to amend the motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.801(e) (incorporating the amendment procedure under Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.850(f)(2) for timely but facially insufficient post-conviction motions);\n   <em>\n    Belanger v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6916975\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/146/136/#p137\">\n    146 So.3d 136\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 137 (Fla. 3d DCA 2014). Accordingly, we reverse the order under review to allow Lopez to file a facially sufficient rule 3.801 motion within sixty days of the issuance of this Court's mandate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Belanger\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6916975\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/146/136/#p137\">\n    146 So.3d at 137\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Reversed.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
