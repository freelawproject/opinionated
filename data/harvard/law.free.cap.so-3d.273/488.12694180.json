R.S. 14:60 and second degree battery in violation of La. R.S. 14:31.1. For the following reasons, we affirm defendant's convictions and sentences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     STATEMENT OF THE CASE\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On February 17, 2017, the Jefferson Parish District Attorney filed a bill of information charging defendant, Brandon L. Pike, with aggravated burglary of a residence belonging to Shirley Fazande, in violation of La. R.S. 14:60 (count one), and second degree battery of Ms. Fazande, in violation of La. R.S. 14:34.1 (count two). Defendant pled not guilty at his arraignment on February 22, 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On February 24, 2018, defendant filed a \"Motion to Declare La. C.Cr.P. art. 782(A) and La. Const. Art. I, \u00a7 17 Unconstitutional because they Allow for a Nonunanimous Verdict in this Second-Class Case,\" which the trial court denied on the morning of trial. A one-day trial commenced before a twelve-person jury on February 27, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The jury found defendant guilty as charged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On March 15, 2018, defendant filed a motion for new trial and for post-verdict judgment of acquittal. The following day, March 16, 2018, the trial court denied defendant's post-verdict motions and, after a waiver of delays, sentenced defendant to thirty years imprisonment at hard labor on count one and eight years imprisonment at hard labor on count two. The trial judge ordered the sentences to be served consecutively. Defendant's motion to reconsider sentence was denied by the trial court following sentencing. This timely appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The victim, eighty-four-year-old Shirley Fazande, testified at trial that defendant, Brandon Pike, broke into her home on December 31, 2016, and confronted her in her hallway. She recalled that defendant broke through the front door of her home and was approximately three to four feet away from her when he demanded her money. When she informed defendant that she did not have any money, he pushed her into her bedroom and started \"beating [her] in the head,\" rendering her unconscious. Once she regained consciousness, she was able to call her daughter-in-law for help. When her son and daughter-in-law arrived at her home, she told them that defendant, who lived around the corner, attacked her. The victim explained that she knew defendant from the neighborhood commodity store and testified that she would see him three to four times a week when he would pass in front of her house. The victim further testified that the only item missing from her home was her television. On cross-examination the victim stated that she did not know how long she was \"out\" but that she recalled the attack happened at night.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Detective Carl Koppeis of the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office testified that on December 31, 2016, he reported to 6605 16th Street in Marrero, Louisiana, to investigate an aggravated burglary. Upon his arrival, it appeared that the front door had been kicked open. Based on conversations with the victim, her son (Ronald Fazande), and other individuals at the scene, defendant was developed as a suspect. Detective Koppeis testified that he went to the hospital to speak with the victim, and observed substantial swelling to her face, including her left eye which was swollen shut, and dried blood behind her left ear. He further explained that the victim identified defendant from a photographic lineup.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ms. Fazande also told Detective Koppeis that she knew defendant from the neighborhood commodity store and the neighborhood. A warrant was prepared for defendant's arrest, and upon his arrest, scratches were observed on his hands.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Deborah Fazande, the victim's daughter-in-law, testified that she and her husband, Ronald, were shopping when they received a phone call from the victim asking for help. Because she and Ronald were not home at the time, a neighbor, Russell Goff, was sent to check on the victim until they could get there. Deborah identified several photographs depicting the condition of the victim's home upon their arrival, including damage sustained to the front door frame, kitchen door, and several rooms of the house which had been ransacked. Deborah also noted that the victim's television was missing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Deborah testified that prior to the incident, the victim was very active, exercising at the fitness center three days a week, volunteering at Ochsner Westbank two days a week, traveling with a ladies social group, and participating in various social activities in the community. However, since the incident, she explained that the victim has been unable to do any of these activities. Deborah also testified that she now helps the victim with her cooking and drives her to therapy as she is no longer able to do so herself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Russell Goff testified that at around noon on December 31, 2016, he received a phone call to go check on his neighbor, the victim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Upon his arrival, he saw that the front door had been kicked in, the house was in disarray, the television was missing from the bedroom, and the victim was lying on the floor in the den. Russell testified that he gave the victim some juice because she was a diabetic and that once she started drinking the juice, she started to remember what had happened.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Russell recalled that at first the victim thought she might have fallen but then when she began to \"come through,\" she told him that she had been attacked and that her assailant was a guy from the neighborhood-a heavy-set, light-skinned African-American man, who worked at the neighborhood commodity store and whom Russell's mother knew.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Russell's mother, Sabrina Knapper, testified that she was on the phone with her son when he went to the victim's house to check on her. Through FaceTime, Sabrina observed that the victim's face was swollen and testified that she was able to hear the victim's description of the perpetrator. Based on the description the victim provided, Sabrina testified that she knew the victim's assailant was defendant, a neighbor \"from around the corner,\" whom she had known for years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Ronald Fazande, the victim's son, testified that he accompanied his wife Deborah to his mother's house shortly after they received her phone call. He recalled that she was seated in a chair in the den and that her eye was swollen shut with cuts on the back of her neck and ear. He observed that the front door of the house had been kicked in, his mother's room had been torn apart, and her television was missing. Ronald also testified that he heard his mother's description of the perpetrator but did not initially know who she was talking about until Sabrina informed him that it was defendant, whom he recalled seeing in the neighborhood.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On appeal, defendant assigns the following errors: (1) the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to support his convictions; (2) the trial court erred in sentencing defendant for aggravated battery rather than aggravated burglary; (3) the consecutive sentences imposed are constitutionally excessive; (4) the convictions for both aggravated burglary and second degree battery constitute double jeopardy; (5) trial counsel was ineffective for failing to raise a double jeopardy claim; and (6) the non-unanimous jury verdict violates the Equal Protection Clause and is unconstitutional. We address each assignment of error in turn:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In his first assignment of error, defendant contends that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to support his convictions for aggravated burglary and second\n   degree battery, on the sole basis that the State failed to prove his identity as the perpetrator of the crimes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence, an appellate court must determine that the evidence, whether direct or circumstantial, or a mixture of both, viewed in the light most favorable to the prosecution, was sufficient to convince a rational trier of fact that all of the elements of the crime have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\n   <em>\n    Jackson v.

When circumstantial evidence is used to prove the commission of the offense, La. R.S. 15:438 provides, \"assuming every fact to be proved that the evidence tends to prove, in order to convict, it must exclude every reasonable hypothesis of innocence.\" The reviewing court is not required to determine whether another possible hypothesis of innocence suggested by the defendant offers an exculpatory explanation of events. Rather, the reviewing court must determine whether the possible alternative hypothesis is sufficiently reasonable that a rational trier of fact could not have found proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\n   <em>\n    State v.

R.S. 14:60, which required the State to prove the following elements in this case: 1) the unauthorized entering of any inhabited dwelling where a person is present, 2) with the intent to commit a felony or any theft therein, if the offender, 3) commits a battery upon any person while in such place, or in entering or leaving such place; and of second degree battery, in violation of La. R.S. 14:34.1, which is a battery, defined in pertinent part as \"the intentional use of force or violence upon the person of another\" when the offender intentionally inflicts serious bodily injury. Encompassed within proving the elements of an offense is the necessity of proving the identity of the defendant as the perpetrator. Where the key issue is identification, the State is required to negate any reasonable probability of misidentification in order to carry its burden of proof.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Defendant claims that the victim's identification of him as the perpetrator is not reliable because of: (1) the lack of the victim's ability to view her assailant at the time of the crimes given the fact that the time the crimes occurred and how long the victim was unconscious were both undetermined; (2) the victim's history of diabetes and recent cataract surgery might have affected her ability to accurately view her\n   assailant; (3) the victim's lack of attention based on the testimony that the victim does not \"think clearly\" when her blood sugar is \"off\"; (4) the vague and inaccurate description of the assailant provided by the victim; (5) the lack of certainty demonstrated by the victim; and (6) the length of time between the crime and the confrontation after having been repeatedly told by her neighbor, Sabrina, that defendant was the perpetrator. He further contends the photographic lineup was unduly suggestive because it focused solely on defendant, and was presented to the victim at a time when she was injured and not wearing her glasses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In assessing the reliability of eyewitness identifications when reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence, Louisiana courts apply the five factors set forth by the United States Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Manson v.

The testimony further showed that the first person to enter the victim's home after the incident was her next-door neighbor, Russell. The victim informed Russell that although she could not recall her assailant's name, she recognized him and described him as a heavy-set, light-skinned, African-American man who worked at the neighborhood commodity store and whom his mother (Sabrina) also knew. The victim testified that she not only knew her assailant from the commodity store, but would also see him in the neighborhood three to four times a week when he would pass in front of her house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Further, there is no evidence to support any allegation of police misconduct related to the photographic lineup. Detective Koppeis recalled that the victim had \"no problems\" immediately identifying defendant as her assailant from a photographic lineup presented to her. Thus, although Sabrina may have supplied defendant's first name based on the information obtained from the victim, it was the victim herself who provided the detailed description of defendant whom she independently knew from the neighborhood and positively, \"immediately\" identified from a photographic lineup and at trial. As previously set forth, positive identification by only one witness is sufficient to support a conviction.\n   <em>\n    State v. Williams\n   </em>\n   , 08-272 (La.

However, the victim testified that she did not need the juice she was given because her blood sugar was not low, and thus, her faculties were not affected in any way. In the absence of internal contradiction or irreconcilable conflict with physical evidence, one witness' testimony, if believed by the trier of fact, is sufficient to support a requisite factual finding.\n   <em>\n    State v.

This assignment of error lacks merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In his second assignment of error, Defendant argues the trial court erred in sentencing him for an offense for which he was not convicted. Specifically, defendant maintains that he was charged with and found guilty of aggravated burglary and second degree battery; however, in imposing the sentences for these convictions, the trial judge sentenced defendant on count one for \"aggravated battery\" to thirty years imprisonment at hard labor.

However, in\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   , this Court found that although the sentencing transcript did not indicate whether the trial court's reference to the wrong offense was an inadvertent error or an actual mistaken belief, unlike\n   <em>\n    Session\n   </em>\n   , the imposed sentence of life imprisonment did not fall within the sentencing range for both offenses. Thus, this Court found the trial judge had made an inadvertent error when she referred to count one as aggravated battery rather than aggravated rape. Accordingly, this Court found defendant's sentence was not illegal, and the case did not require remand for resentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In this case, the record reflects that the trial judge referred to the wrong offense when sentencing defendant on count one.

It's the sentence of this Court, after consideration under the sentencing guidelines of 894.1, that I can't fathom anybody that would do that to an elderly lady; I can't. I don't even understand what would possess you to do that. People are taught to respect each other, and they're taught to respect their elders; at least that's the way it was-- as you can tell, I have the gray hair, that's the way I was raised. Alright? I was taught to, in any way if I lived in a neighborhood, to help someone who was in need of help, if it be cutting her grass, if it means cleaning her house, if it means taking in her groceries, anything that I could do to help someone in time of need. I can't even understand why someone who lived in a neighborhood could do this; I can't even fathom it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   Therefore, based on the evidence presented to me for what you did to Ms. Fazande, the physical damage and trauma that you caused to her, the fact that she was eighty-four, going on eighty-five years old at that time, that lady shouldn't have to worry about someone that lives in her neighborhood do this to her. She should be concentrating on every day she has left in her life to live it to the fullest that she wants.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   Therefore, I considered the sentencing guidelines under 894.1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Article; and I believe that when you've been convicted of a felony, the Court should impose the sentence of imprisonment if any of the following circumstances exists: I believe there's an undue risk, that during the period of a suspended sentence or probation, you would commit another crime, under A l; A 2, the Defendant is in need of a correctional treatment or custodial environment that can be provided most effectively by his commitment to an institution; and, three, any lesser sentence would deprecate the seriousness of the Defendant's crime.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   Other than certain other crimes that I consider in this Code, I can't imagine any crime being worse than beating an eighty-four year old person in their home to the point where they're unconscious and their face is swollen, and they wake up on the floor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Considering the nature of the crime, the record reflects-as also reiterated by the trial court at sentencing-defendant kicked in the front door to a house of an elderly eighty-four-year-old victim, who was home alone at the time and familiar with defendant from the neighborhood.

R.S. 14:60, and second degree battery, in violation of La. R.S. 14:34.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Aggravated burglary is defined in La. R.S. 14:60 as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   Aggravated burglary is the unauthorized entering of any inhabited dwelling, or of any structure, water craft, or movable where a person is present, with\n   the intent to commit a felony or any theft therein, if the offender,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   (1) Is armed with a dangerous weapon; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   (2) After entering arms himself with a dangerous weapon; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   (3) Commits a battery upon any person while in such place, or in entering or leaving such place.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Therefore, in order to prove the crime of aggravated burglary, the State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant made an unauthorized entry of a structure with the intent to commit a theft or a felony. Additionally, the State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt one of the three aggravating circumstances listed in La. R.S. 14:60. Based on the record, it is apparent that the State sought to prove the third aggravating circumstance under La. R.S. 14:60(3) by proving that defendant committed a battery upon the victim, Ms. Fazande, while in her home, after having unlawfully entered it with the intent to commit a felony or theft therein. To prove a \"battery\" to satisfy the third aggravating circumstance under the aggravated burglary statute, the State must prove \"intentional use of force or violence upon the person of another.\" La. R.S. 14:34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   However, to support a conviction for second degree battery under La. R.S. 14:34.1, the State must additionally prove that said battery resulted in \"serious bodily injury,\" which is statutorily defined as \"bodily injury which involves unconsciousness, extreme physical pain or protracted and obvious disfigurement, or protracted loss or impairment of the function of a bodily member, organ, or mental faculty, or a substantial risk of death.\" La. R.S. 14:34.1(B)(3). Therefore, a conviction for second degree battery requires proof of an \"additional fact\" or element,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , \"serious bodily injury\" as statutorily defined, not required to prove the \"battery\" as contemplated under the aggravated burglary statute, La. R.S. 14:60. Therefore, we find that, applying the\n   <em>\n    Blockburger\n   </em>\n   test, convictions for aggravated burglary and second degree battery arising out of the same transaction or act do not constitute double jeopardy.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

When the trial court asked defense counsel if he had any motions, defense counsel responded, \"[a]t this time, no, Your Honor.\" The court then adopted the verdicts of the jury as the judgment of the court.
