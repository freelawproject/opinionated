Shannon Craig Parker appeals his aggravated-assault conviction and enhanced sentence. We assigned his appeal to the Court of Appeals, which affirmed. However, the appellate court was divided on one of the three issues Parker raised-whether the trial judge abused his discretion in denying Parker's request for a mental evaluation to pursue a possible insanity defense. We granted Parker's petition for writ of certiorari to review this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b62. After review, we hold the trial judge did not abuse his discretion when he denied Parker's pro se motion for a mental evaluation. Although given the opportunity to do so, Parker presented no concrete reason establishing the need for a mental evaluation to assist in the pursuit of a viable insanity defense. Instead, Parker offered only unsupported assertions of diminished capacity-a defense not recognized by Mississippi law. We thus affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    Background Facts and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Shooting\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b63. Eric and Edna Burkett were standing outside their home in Hattiesburg, Mississippi, when a white pickup truck stopped in front of them. The driver got out, and the Burketts asked if he needed help. The man mumbled something, grabbed a rifle, and shot Eric, wounding him. The man also fired shots at Edna but missed. Soon after, the police found the white truck in a nearby ditch. Its tires were still spinning. The driver, later identified as Parker, was in the truck. He was arrested and later confirmed by the Burketts as the man who attacked them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64. Parker appeared to be under the influence. So police waited until the next day to interview him.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Parker, through a written statement, told police \"I don't no [sic] victim. Don't even no [sic] victim. All I remember is sitting spinning.\" At the interviewing officer's recommendation, Parker underwent a mental evaluation. The evaluation was performed by a licensed professional counselor. Parker told the counselor that he had previously been treated for anxiety and depression. The counselor concluded that Parker \"was verbal and responsive\" and that \"[h]is thought processes were rational.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Rejected Plea\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b65. Although indicted on two counts of assault, the State elected to proceed only on the aggravated assault against Eric, with a five-year sentencing enhancement for using a firearm.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2097-3-7\">\n    Miss.

Code Ann. \u00a7 97-37-37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1) (Rev. 2014) (firearm enhancement). A week before the scheduled trial, Parker planned to plead guilty. But at the plea hearing, Parker claimed he had no recollection of the crime. And he maintained he could not verify the State's recitation of the facts. Under the circumstances, the trial judge determined he could not accept Parker's plea. At that point, the judge turned to pretrial matters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b66. One of these matters was defense counsel's prior indication that she did not intend to call an expert. At this point, Parker's counsel clarified that \"this is where Mr. Parker and I disagree on the strategies of this trial.\" While Parker wanted a mental evaluation, counsel advised him he did not fall within \"the parameters that the law requires in order to request a mental evaluation.\" Despite the time limit to make such a request having already passed, the trial judge permitted Parker to file a motion for a mental evaluation pro se. The judge also set the matter for a hearing the following Monday. The judge advised Parker that he may need to bring witnesses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Motion for Mental Evaluation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b67. The hearing began with Parker's counsel confirming she and her co-counsel did not believe they could, as a matter of professional ethics, present Parker's motion. Specifically, counsel stated that, \"I don't believe under\n   <em>\n    M'Naghten\n   </em>\n   that I would be able to present that motion.\" Parker then argued his motion pro se. He first attempted to rely on what he had written in his unsworn motion. The motion cited what the Burketts and arresting officers had allegedly said about this behavior the night he shot Eric. But the trial judge instructed Parker that he could not cite what other people allegedly said outside the courtroom as evidence. The trial judge then asked a series of probing questions about Parker's mental-health and prescription-drug history. Parker recollected he had suffered from anxiety and depression and once attempted suicide. At the end of the hearing, the trial judge concluded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Basically based on what the [trial] Court has to look at in terms of the treatment for anxiety and depression and the unfortunate event with attempting to commit suicide one time, there's nothing in anything, that information or the demeanor I've seen, the motions that have been filed, the court file itself, my interactions\n   with Mr. Parker to lead me to believe that there's any rational basis for appointing a psychiatrist or psychologist to examine him for the purpose of determining either his competency or sanity.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b68. The case proceeded to trial three days later. The jury found Parker guilty of aggravated assault and using a firearm during the commission of his crime. The judge sentenced Parker to twenty years for the assault conviction, with an additional five years for the firearm enhancement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Appeal\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b69. This Court assigned Parker's appeal to the Court of Appeals, which affirmed. Parker presented three issues on appeal: (1) the trial judge erred in allowing the State's firearm expert to testify; (2) the trial judge abused his discretion in denying Parker's motion for a mental evaluation; and (3) the firearm enhancement violated the constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy. While the appellate court unanimously agreed the first and third issues presented no reversible error, the court was equally divided on the second issue. Based on this split, we granted Parker's petition for certiorari review. Although Parker reasserted all three appellate issues in his petition, we limit our review to the issue of Parker's request for a mental evaluation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Guice v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8315124\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/952/129/#p133\">\n    952 So.2d 129\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 133 (Miss. 2007) (recognizing this Court's \"unquestionabl[e]\" authority to limit the question on certiorari review).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Competency versus Insanity\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b610. In his petition, Parker echoes the criticism made in the dissenting Court of Appeals opinion that \"the trial court was focused on Parker's ability to stand trial rather than his sanity at the time of the incident.\"\n   <em>\n    Parker v.

We recognize, without question, that competency and sanity are two distinct concepts.\n   <em>\n    Sanders v.

Competency to stand trial is measured at the time of trial. And its standard is \"whether the defendant has 'sufficient present ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding' and 'has a rational as well as factual understanding of the proceedings against him.' \"\n   <em>\n    Martin v.

By contrast, insanity-or, more precisely, a defendant's affirmative defense of not guilty by reason of insanity-is measured at the time of the criminal offense. And its standard is the \"\n   <em>\n    M'Naghten\n   </em>\n   rule.\"\n   <em>\n    Davis v.

Under this rule:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   To establish a defense on the ground of insanity, it must be clearly proved that at the time of committing of the act the accused was laboring under such defect of reason from disease of the mind as (1) not to know the nature and quality of the act he was doing, or (2) if he did know it, that he did not know that what he was doing was wrong.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7519642\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/551/165/#p173\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Hunter v.

First, we point out that just because Parker advanced his motion for mental evaluation on his claim that he may have been legally insane when he shot Eric does not put the trial court in error for also making an on-the-record ruling on Parker's competency. In fact, then-applicable Uniform Rule of Circuit and County Court Practice 9.06 mandated the trial judge\n   <em>\n    sua\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    sponte\n   </em>\n   order a mental evaluation and conduct a competency hearing if the judge had \"reasonable ground to believe that [Parker was] incompetent to stand trial[.]\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Parker's actions leading up to the motion hearing at least raised the specter of his potential inability to consult with his court-appointed attorneys or understand the proceedings against him.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   So we certainly do not fault the trial court for using the hearing to ensure no reasonable ground existed to believe Parker was incompetent to stand trial and face a jury seventy-two hours later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b613. Further, that the court assessed Parker's competency does not mean it failed to consider his potential insanity defense as a basis for granting a mental evaluation. The record shows the court permitted Parker to file his pro se motion out of time,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   despite Parker's counsel informing the court she could not ethically file a motion for mental evaluation because she did not believe Parker met the conditions to receive one. The court was in fact cautious and set the motion for a pretrial hearing, telling Parker the court \"intend[ed] to take testimony\" and advising him he may have to call witnesses in support.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b614. At the hearing, when Parker directed the court's attention to his claim that he was insane at the time of the crime, the court patiently responded, \"All right, well, I'm here, and I'll sit here as long as we need to sit here to let you offer me proof that you have a mental problem or disease that would-that had some effect on why you don't remember what happened.\" Still, Parker failed to produce any proof. And the trial judge again reassured him, \"I'll let you go and say whatever you wanted to say, and then I'm going to go through this and do what I want to do, and you be thinking, if there's\n   <em>\n    any other proof you want me to consider, any medical records, any witnesses, anything of that nature\n   </em>\n   , I'll sit here ... till [five o'clock]. If we need to reconvene in the morning, we'll do that.\" (Emphasis added.) Despite the opportunity, guidance, and reassurance by the trial court, Parker made no attempt to call any witness. Nor did he attempt to submit any records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b615. After Parker failed to present any proof, the trial judge expressly concluded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   [T]here's nothing in anything, that information or the demeanor I've seen, the motions that have been filed, the court file itself, my interactions with Mr. Parker to lead me to believe that there's\n   any rational basis for appointing a psychiatrist or psychologist to examine him for the purpose of determining either his competency\n   <em>\n    or sanity\n   </em>\n   .\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   (Emphasis added.) Our review of the record demonstrates the trial judge thoroughly considered Parker's request for a mental evaluation to assist a potential insanity defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Unsubstantiated Assertions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b616. As to the merits of this request, we agree with the Court of Appeals plurality that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Parker's motion for a mental evaluation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b617. \"This Court weighs on a case by case basis whether the denial of expert assistance for an accused is prejudicial to the assurance of a fair trial ....\"\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

Parker relied exclusively on (1) his assertion he did not know the victim and could not remember anything about the night of the assault and (2) his own personal recollection about his mental-health history. This history included his taking prescription drugs for anxiety and depression and a suicide attempt three years earlier. But, as the Court of Appeals plurality aptly put it, Parker's history of treatment for anxiety and depression \"has no apparent relevance to his ability to know right from wrong at the time of the offense.\"\n   <em>\n    Parker\n   </em>\n   , --- So.3d at ----,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201602585\">\n    2018 WL 1602585\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sanders v.

As to Parker's other statements-which the dissent suggests should have been considered competent evidence in support of Parker's motion-the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in excluding them as hearsay. Again, Parker did not call any witnesses. Instead, he merely offered an unsworn pleading as support, which contained what he alleged were statements from others. The judge explained that Parker could not offer out-of-court statements from\n   <em>\n    others\n   </em>\n   about how he was acting that night to\n   <em>\n    prove\n   </em>\n   in fact how he acted. As the trial court correctly described it, what Parker was attempting to offer was textbook hearsay. Parker wanted to offer statements by the arresting officers and victims, made out of court, to prove the truth of what they had asserted-namely, that Parker appeared to be \"belligerent,\" that Parker \"appeared to be under the influence of some type of drug or alcohol,\" and that Parker had been \"talking in a strange language\" and \"mumbling.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Miss. R.

The fact Parker himself supposedly could not recollect his behavior or state of mind when he shot Eric does not change the fundamental evidentiary rule that he could not testify about what\n   <em>\n    others\n   </em>\n   witnessed. Of course, Parker could have\n   called the arresting officers and victims to testify about what Parker had said that night to prove Parker's state of mind.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   If he had done so,\n   <em>\n    their\n   </em>\n   testimony would not be hearsay, because it would have been offered not to prove what Parker said was true but instead to prove Parker's incoherence. But, though he was given the opportunity to do so, that is not what Parker did. Instead, Parker tried to shoehorn in unsworn out-of-court statements from others aimed at proving what was asserted about Parker's behavior was in fact true. Again, with respect for the dissent, this is hearsay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b623. The hearsay-exception cases the dissent cites are clearly distinguishable.

This Court affirmed the irrelevance and inadmissibility of this statement in a sexual-battery case.

A police officer testified that, when Parker stepped out of his vehicle, he \"stood there and stared at [the officer].\" The police officer went on to testify that Parker \"was kind of wobbly\" and had difficultly standing straight, ultimately falling to the ground. Parker then was arrested.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b630. At the police station that night, a detective chose not to try to obtain a statement from Parker. According to the detective, one of the reasons she did not interview Parker was because of her belief that his statement could not have been voluntarily or knowingly made at that time. She speculated that Parker might have been under the influence of some substance. No evidence was obtained from the vehicle or the scene that supported this suspicion. Parker's blood was not tested for alcohol or drugs. On the following day the detective obtained a handwritten statement from Parker that said, simply, \"I don't no [sic] victim. Don't even no [sic] victim. All I remember is sitting spinning.\" After meeting with Parker, the detective recommended that mental health personnel evaluate him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b631. A brief evaluation did occur the day after the incident. The report stated that Parker had been treated for depression and anxiety for years and that his current medications were Wellbutrin, Viibryd, and Xanax. The report did not address Parker's mental state on the night of the incident, and nothing suggests that the evaluation was performed to assess his mental competency to stand trial. The report was prepared by a person whose name is followed by \"LPC,\" which I believe stands for Licensed Professional Counselor, and \"NCC,\" which I believe stands for National Certified Counselor. She recommended that Parker be seen by a \"medical provider at the jail for placement on medications treating his [symptoms] of anxiety and depression.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b632. During a pretrial hearing in circuit court, Parker told the trial judge that he had no recollection of the shooting and did not know whether he had committed the crime. Parker told the judge that he wanted a mental evaluation to support an insanity defense. The court gave Parker an opportunity to prepare his motion, which he drafted by 5:00 p.m. the following evening.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   A few days later, Parker argued his own motion to the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b633. Parker began his argument by reading his three-page motion. The motion asserted that, at the time of the offense, Parker \"was in no right state of mind\" and was not \"able to know right from wrong.\" Parker's motion noted that arresting officers had described him as \"belligerent\" and had thought that he \"appeared to be under the influence of some type of drug or alcohol.\" The motion noted also that the Burketts had told police that he was \"talking in a strange language\" and \"mumbling incoherently.\" Parker's motion stated further that he had been treated for depression and anxiety and had been prescribed Wellbutrin, Viibryd, and Xanax. Finally, Parker requested a mental examination and an expert to testify in support of his insanity defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b634. After reading his motion aloud, Parker testified to a history of mental-illness-related hospitalizations, the names or locations of medical facilities at which he had\n   received treatment, a prior suicide attempt, and a number of medications he had taken over the years for anxiety, depression, and psychosis. Parker also testified that, at the time he assaulted the Burketts, he was under a doctor's care and on medication for anxiety and depression. In addition, Parker testified that he received Social Security disability benefits for physical and mental issues. Parker testified he had no idea whether he had been under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b635. Throughout the hearing, the circuit judge focused on Parker's mental competency to stand trial rather than on his alleged insanity at the time of the offense.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Parker made it clear that he was not questioning his competency to stand trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ultimately the circuit court denied Parker's motion: \"I find that Mr. Parker is competent to stand trial at this time, and the trial will go forward on Thursday[.]\" Parker was tried, convicted, and sentenced. A plurality of the Court of Appeals affirmed; the Court of Appeals was evenly divided-almost; one judge voted, without opinion, to affirm in part and dissent in part.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Parker v.

Evidence Considered by the Circuit Court\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \u00b640. As noted above, Parker submitted a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   motion for mental evaluation and testified in support of his motion. Parker testified about his history of mental-illness-related hospitalizations, the names or locations of medical facilities at which he had received mental health treatment, a prior suicide attempt, and a number of medications he had taken over the years for anxiety, depression, and psychosis. Some of the prescribed drugs Parker testified he had taken were Wellbutrin, Viibryd,\n   and Xanax. Parker testified also that, at the time he assaulted the Burketts, he was under a doctor's care and was on medicine for anxiety and depression.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   In addition, Parker testified that he received Social Security disability benefits for physical and mental issues. Finally, Parker testified that he had no recollection of what had happened during the shooting and that he did not remember having been there.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Evidence Not Considered by the Circuit Court\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   \u00b641. The circuit court made no mention of having considered any of the following additional evidence before denying Parker's motion. Parker testified that the arresting officers had described him as \"belligerent\" and had thought that he \"appeared to be under the influence of some type of drug or alcohol.\" Accordingly, law enforcement personnel did not attempt to obtain a statement from Parker on the night he was taken into custody. Parker also testified that Eric Burkett had said that Parker was \"talking in a strange language and mumbled.\" Parker further testified that Edna Burkett had said Parker was \"mumbling\" and had \"continued to mumble someone's name.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   \u00b642. The circuit court did not consider that evidence because it determined,\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   , that all of the statements were inadmissible hearsay: \"[W]hat you've done, Mr. Parker, is [that] you [have] cited a bunch of people and what they allegedly said, but they're not in the courtroom, and that's hearsay.... and I don't see that there's an exception to the rule against hearsay.\" With respect, the trial judge was mistaken in his evidentiary analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   \u00b643. \"Hearsay\" is defined as \"a statement that (1) the declarant does not make while testifying at the current trial or hearing; and (2) a party offers in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted in the statement.\" M.R.E. 801(c). Parker did not offer into evidence the above statements to prove the truth of the matters asserted.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   He was not trying to prove that he was \"under the influence of some type of drug or alcohol\" or that he actually was \"talking in a strange language\" and \"mumbling.\" He offered the statements to prove, as best he could, his state of mind at the time of the offense.

The majority finds that Parker offered the out-of-court statements for the purpose of proving that he was, in fact, belligerent, incomprehensible, and generally unable to control himself,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   . The majority asserts this properly was deemed inadmissible hearsay without exception, and distinguishes the above-cited cases illustrating the state-of-mind exception.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   \u00b646. However, the record makes clear that Parker did not offer the statements to prove truth of the matter asserted, nor did he offer them to prove his sanity, or lack thereof. The out-of-court statements were offered to show Parker's state of mind during and soon after his bizarre, motiveless assault on the Burketts. He had no recollection of the events, but other witnesses did. This was apparent from Parker's testimony at the pretrial hearing:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   [Court]: ... I want you to tell me what it is about this case and your involvement in it that could convince me that you have a mental condition, that leads you to be incompetent to stand trial or to assist your attorneys in the defense of your case?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   [Defendant]: ... I have no recollection of any idea of what I was doing in Palmer's Crossing that night. I don't even remember being there. I don't have any recollection of what happened.\n   <em>\n    My mental capability at that time of said crime, I have no idea. I was not even at myself. I mean there's people that put -- that state this, and me, myself, I have no recollection\n   </em>\n   . That's a 24-hour period of time that when I was brought to Forrest County Jail and then woke up the next morning in the holding cell.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   \u00b647. These contemporaneous statements of Parker's are about his then-existing mental, emotional, or physical condition at the time of the shooting. Parker testified he had no awareness or memory of his actions. It does not follow that the statements were offered to prove the fact of his\n   <em>\n    behavior\n   </em>\n   -as the majority finds. The out-of-court statements provided by several witnesses relate to Parker's mental condition or state of mind at the time of and soon after the tragic shooting. Nor does the fact that Parker testified about what others witnessed preclude the statements' admissibility. These statements are the kind contemplated by Rule 803(3), a well-known exception to the rule against hearsay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   \u00b648. From all indications, Parker was lucid and rational at the time he stood before the trial court and begged for a mental health evaluation by a court-appointed expert. Parker did not claim that he was mentally incompetent to stand trial or to assist counsel with his defense. Thus, the trial judge was addressing a question that was not being asked, while leaving unanswered the all-important question of whether Parker had made a sufficient showing of his state of mind at the time of his assault upon the Burketts to warrant a mental health examination by a qualified, court-appointed mental health professional. The judge's failure to consider Parker's rendition of relevant witness statements made in close proximity in time to the\n   assault was error which was, in significant part, due to the judge's erroneous belief that the statements were inadmissible hearsay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Application of the Rule to the Evidence Presented\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   \u00b649.
