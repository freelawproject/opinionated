The offenses were tried together in a joint trial with codefendant Angel Elvira. A jury found appellant guilty of both offenses and assessed punishment at 30-years confinement on the aggravated robbery charge and 50-years confinement on the aggravated sexual assault charge. We address (1) whether appellant\u2019s counsel was ineffective during the punishment stage of the trial by presenting appellant as a witness, admitting the offenses he had denied during testimony at guilt/innocence and (2) whether appellant waived any error arising from the trial court\u2019s denial of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>appellant\u2019s motion to sever by either admitting guilt at punishment or by not presenting a sufficient record for review. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">The evidence presented at trial showed that, on November 17, 1995, appellant and Angel Elvira robbed a man and his wife at gunpoint in their home. Appellant forced the wife to engage in oral sex at gunpoint. Elvira also sexually assaulted the wife, after they had tied her hands and legs. Elvira was arrested a few hours later when one of the victim\u2019s credit cards was found in Elvira\u2019s possession during a traffic stop. The victims identified Elvira in a lineup and identified appellant from a photo spread. Appellant was arrested at his home, where several items of the victims\u2019 property were found. Both Elvira and appellant confessed to robbing the victims. However, they both denied committing any type of sexual assault. DNA from the semen found at the victims\u2019 home matched appellant\u2019s DNA to a probability of one in 5.84 billion among the Hispanic population. Tests also revealed that hairs found at the scene matched hairs taken from appellant. At the guilt/innocence stage of the trial, appellant testified that he did not rob the victims, that he had never been on their street, and that Elvira had given him the items found in his apartment. However, during the punishment phase of the trial, appellant admitted committing both offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">Denial of Motion to Sever</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">In his second point of error, appellant claims the trial court erred in denying his motion to sever. Appellant argues that, pri- or to trial, the court was informed of the inconsistent and irreconcilable positions appellant and Elvira were to take at trial and that severance was, therefore, mandatory pursuant to article 36.09 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Tex.Code CRIM.P.Ann. art. 36.09 (Vernon 1981).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In addition, appellant contends that the court\u2019s error was not waived by appellant\u2019s admission of guilt at punishment. <em>See DeGarmo v. State, </em>691 S.W.2d 657, 661 (Tex.Crim.App.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-11\">A. <em>DeGarmo </em>Waiver</p>\n<p id=\"b170-12\">Whenever an accused admits his guilt at the punishment phase of a criminal trial, he has, for legal purposes, entered the equivalent of a plea of guilty. <em>DeGarmo, </em>691 S.W.2d at 661. By admitting guilt, the defendant waives all nonjurisdictional errors occurring at the guilt/innocence phase of the trial. <em>Id. </em>The Court of Criminal Appeals recently confirmed the continuing viability of the <em>DeGarmo </em>doctrine in <em>McGlothlin v. State, </em>stating that judicial confessions at the punishment phase must be viewed in the context of the basic purpose of a trial, which is the determination of truth. 896 S.W.2d 183, 187 (Tex.Crim.App.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-13\">Appellant asserts that the <em>DeGar-mo </em>doctrine is inapplicable to this case. Appellant argues that the trial court\u2019s denial of his pretrial motion to sever constituted structural error <em>ab initio. </em>The <em>DeGarmo </em>doctrine is limited by its own terms to waiving error at the guilt/innocence phase. Neither party has cited, and we have been unable to find, a case which addresses whether the erroneous denial of a motion to sever can be waived by an admission of guilt under the <em>DeGarmo </em>doctrine. However, in a case addressing whether the <em>DeGarmo </em>waiver doctrine applies' to errors made during jury selection, the Second Court of Appeals held no waiver had occurred. <em>See Post v. State, </em>936 S.W.2d 343, 348 (Tex.App.\u2014Fort Worth 1996, pet. ref d) (refusing to extend <em>DeGarmo </em>to errors made during jury selection). In <em>Post, </em>the court noted that most cases invoking the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number><em>DeGarmo </em>doctrine have involved challenges to the sufficiency and admissibility of evidence. <em>Id. </em>Errors involving evidence sufficiency and admissibility impact the guilt/innocence phase of a trial. However, the jury selection error at issue in <em>Post </em>involved punishment issues only. <em>See id. </em>While certain pretrial motions concern admissibility of the evidence, thereby presumably falling within the scope of <em>DeGarmo, </em>a pretrial motion to sever such as the one involved in this case affects the punishment phase <em>as well as </em>the guilt/innocence phase. We decline to extend the <em>DeGarmo </em>waiver doctrine to error committed in denying a motion to sever because severance impacts more than just the guilt/innocenee phase of trial. Accordingly, we hold that, by admitting his guilt of the offenses charged in the indictments, appellant did not waive his challenge to the trial court\u2019s denial of the motion to sever.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\">B. Adequacy of Record</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">Appellant filed motions to sever in both cases, alleging a joint trial would be prejudicial against appellant because Elvira would present an inconsistent defense and had a much higher degree of guilt. The docket sheet reflects that the trial court heard and denied these motions, as do the motions themselves. No court reporter\u2019s record of the motion hearing is before this Court. Appellant initially requested that the record be supplemented with the court reporter\u2019s record from that hearing, but later withdrew the request, apparently based on the absence of such a record. Appellant has not alleged that the record was destroyed, lost, or not taken due to no fault of his own.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">An accused cannot rely upon a general allegation in his severance motion that a codefendant has a conflicting or inconsistent defense; he must apprise the trial court of exactly what the inconsistent defenses will be. <em>Silva v. State, </em>933 S.W.2d 715, 719 (Tex. App.\u2014San Antonio 1996, no pet.). Appellant relies upon an offer of proof made at the motion for new trial hearing, in which appellant\u2019s trial counsel would have described his recollection of the evidence presented at the pretrial hearing on the severance motion. The trial court, however, sustained the State\u2019s objection, stating that trial counsel\u2019s recollection was irrelevant because the record would reflect what occurred at the hearing. Later, during the motion for new trial hearing, trial counsel for eodefendant Elvira testified, without objection, that he recalled telling the trial court at the severance hearing that the codefendants were accusing each other of the offenses, thereby presenting inconsistent defenses. Counsel for Elvira did not recall getting into details of the defenses, but remembered stating only that the code-fendants were accusing one another and had irreconcilable defenses. Under this state of the record, we cannot say that appellant met his burden of apprising the trial court of what the inconsistent defenses would be. Accordingly, we overrule appellant\u2019s second point of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">The discussion of the remaining points of error does not meet the criteria for publication, Tex.R.App.P. 47.4, and is thus ordered not published.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-9\">We affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b169-21\">.
