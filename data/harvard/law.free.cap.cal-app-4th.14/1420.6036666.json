The answer is \u201cno.\u201d We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1214-4\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1214-5\">Prior to <em>People </em>v. <em>Howard </em>the requirements of <em>Boykin/Tahl (Boykin </em>v. <em>Alabama </em>(1969) 395 U.S. 238 [23 L.Ed.2d 274, 89 S.Ct. 1709]; <em>In re Tahl </em>(1969) 1 Cal.3d 122 [81 Cal.Rptr. 577, 460 P.2d 449]), at least in California, might accurately have been summarized as follows: \u201cTo protect a defendant\u2019s fundamental rights, we must indulge every reasonable presumption against waiver of fundamental constitutional rights. The record on its face must show, among other things, an express and explicit waiver of rights. Thus, we may not presume a valid waiver from a silent record or infer a waiver from either the entry of a guilty plea after the advisement of rights or equivocal conduct, such as a defendant\u2019s failure to assert his or her rights or a defendant\u2019s silence when defense counsel waives his or her rights. In such circumstances, the record itself does not show that the defendant personally and unequivocally, that is, expressly and explicitly, waived his or her rights.\u201d <em>(.People </em>v. <em>Anderson </em>(1991) 1 Cal.App.4th 318, 324 [1 Cal.Rptr.2d 676]. Internal citations omitted.) And if these requirements were not satisfied then, according to \u201cmost of [the] statements on the subject\u201d by our Supreme Court <em>(People </em>v. <em>Howard, supra, </em>1 Cal.4th at p. 1175), reversal, regardless of prejudice, followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1214-6\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Howard </em>our Supreme Court reconsidered the appellate review standard for <em>Boykin/Tahl </em>error.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It held \u201cthat <em>Yurko </em>error involving <em>Boykin/Tahl </em>admonitions should be reviewed under the test used to determine the validity of guilty pleas under the federal Constitution. Under that test, a plea is valid if the record affirmatively shows that it is voluntary and intelligent under the totality of the circumstances.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Howard, supra, </em>1 Cal.4th at p. 1175.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1214-7\">Although <em>People </em>v. <em>Howard </em>involved the validity of an enhancement allegation admission, not, as here, solely the validity of a jury trial waiver, still <em>People </em>v. <em>Howard </em>is apposite. <em>People </em>v. <em>Howard </em>construed <em>Boykin/Tahl </em>standards. Those standards determine the validity of a jury trial waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b1214-8\">Under <em>People </em>v. <em>Howard </em>it is permissible to review the totality of the circumstances to determine whether a guilty plea, an admission, or a jury trial waiver\u2014despite <em>Boykin/Tahl </em>admonition error\u2014is voluntary and intelligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1214-9\">The Supreme Court conducted such a review in <em>People </em>v. <em>Howard. </em>Howard expressly admitted an enhancement allegation. The Supreme Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1423\">*1423</page-number>found that his admission, \u201cdespite the absence of an explicit admonition on the privilege against self-incrimination,\u201d was voluntary and intelligent <em>(People </em>v. <em>Howard, supra, </em>1 Cal.4th at p. 1180.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1215-5\">However, the error here is not just with admonitions, although there is such error. In fact, there is no jury trial admonition at all. After the trial court stated, \u201cMr. Prosecutor, would you take the jury waiver?\u201d the prosecutor proceeded to question appellants and a third defendant (through an interpreter) only about their right to a separate interpreter and to a speedy trial. Following their waiver of these rights, and without anything having been said about their jury trial right, the matter was continued.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thereafter, the subject of a right to a jury trial was not addressed. On April 9, 1991, just before the court trial commenced, the trial court stated, \u201cOkay, in the matter of Guzman, Correa and Osorio. There\u2019s already been a jury trial waiver in this matter, has there not, Counsel?\" Trial counsel for defendant Osorio <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1424\">*1424</page-number>answered \u201cYes, Your Honor.\u201d Appellants\u2019 counsel, the district attorney, and, of course, appellants, said nothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-4\">On this record, even if appellants <em>had </em>said the words \u201cI consent to a court trial,\u201d any finding that their waivers were \u201cvoluntary and intelligent\u201d would be dubious indeed. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Moore </em>(1992) 8 Cal.App.4th 411 [10 Cal.Rptr.2d 286] [Defendant had a jury trial, was convicted, bifurcated his two priors, expressly admitted one\u2014but without any admonitions\u2014and then, after full <em>Boykin/Tahl </em>admonitions and waivers, admitted the other. Held, his admission of the first prior was invalid under <em>People </em>v. <em>Howard].)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1216-5\">We need not address such a finding because the error here is the <em>absence </em>of a jury waiver. We find nothing in <em>People </em>v. <em>Howard </em>authorizing an appellate court to find \u201cvoluntary and intelligent\u201d a <em>nonexistent </em>jury trial waiver. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Ernst </em>(1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 75 [14 Cal.Rptr.2d 19].) As Chief Justice Gibson said for a unanimous court, \u201cit has been uniformly held that the [jury trial] waiver must be [ ] expressed [in words] and will not be implied from a defendant\u2019s conduct.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Holmes </em>(1960) 54 Cal.2d 442, 443-444 [5 Cal.Rptr. 871, 353 P.2d 583].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-6\">As <em>People </em>v. <em>Howard </em>clearly implies, before a guilty plea, admission, or jury trial waiver may be found \u201cvoluntary and intelligent\u201d (under the totality of the circumstances), there must first <em>be </em>a guilty plea, admission, or jury trial waiver. Here there was none.</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-7\">A reversal being required, we need not address other errors claimed by both appellants and respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-8\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-9\">The judgments are reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-10\">Lillie, P. J., and Johnson, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1213-12\"> A third defendant was tried with appellants but acquitted (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1118).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1213-13\"> Conspiracy to sell or transport cocaine (Pen. Code, \u00a7 182, subd.

(a)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1214-10\"> The context involved defendant\u2019s admission of a prior felony allegation. <em>Yurko </em>error <em>(In re Yurko </em>(1974) 10 Cal.3d 857 [112 Cal.Rptr. 513, 519 P.2d 561]) was committed because defendant was not expressly informed of his privilege against self-incrimination.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1215-6\"> The pertinent reporter\u2019s transcript reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b1215-7\">\u201cThe Court: Mr. Prosecutor, would you take the jury waiver?</p>\n<p id=\"b1215-8\">\u201cMr. Feldstern: Yes.
