(Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 11359, 11360, subd, (a).) On appeal, he claims the court erred in denying his motion to suppress marijuana seized from him. We affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-5\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b965-6\">At approximately 2:30 p.m. on November 26, 1991, Officer Gilbert Torres of the San Jose Police Department was on Welch Avenue, an area known for providing \u201ccurb service\u201d drug sales. He observed defendant make contact with the occupants of three or four separate cars. Each time, defendant would take something from his right rear pocket, give it to the vehicles\u2019 occupants, and receive something in exchange, which he would then place in his wallet. Torres believed defendant was selling drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-7\">Torres radioed Officer Michael Richmond, who was on uniformed patrol nearby, said he had observed some drug transactions, described defendant, and told Richmond to detain him. Richmond drove down Welch Avenue, saw defendant, stopped, and got out of the patrol car. He then asked defendant to come over to him. They approached each other, meeting in the street. Richmond asked defendant for identification, and defendant said he had none. Richmond then \u201casked him if he was selling dope.\u201d Defendant denied selling dope, but did admit possessing dope for his personal use. Richmond then asked, \u201cwhere is your dope?\u201d Defendant pointed to his right rear pocket. Richmond then removed marijuana from defendant\u2019s pocket and arrested him. At some point, Richmond pat-searched defendant, but he could not recall when he did so.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-8\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b965-9\">Defendant contends the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress the marijuana taken from his pocket.  He claims its seizure was the product of admissions obtained in violation of his Miranda<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> rights. In particular, he argues that at the time he made the admission, he was subject to \u201ccustodial interrogation\u201d and, therefore, Officer Richmond had a duty to advise him of his right to remain silent, to consult a lawyer, to have a lawyer present, and to not incriminate himself. We find no merit in this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1162\">*1162</page-number><em>\u201cMiranda </em>requires that a criminal suspect be admonished of specified Fifth Amendment rights. But in order to invoke its protection, a suspect must be subjected to <em>custodial interrogation, </em>i.e., he must be taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom in any significant way. [Citation.] The ultimate inquiry is simply whether there is a formal arrest or restraint on freedom of movement of file degree associated with a formal arrest.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Morris </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 152, 197 [279 Cal.Rptr. 720, 807 P.2d 949], internal quotation marks and brackets omitted; <em>California </em>v. <em>Beheler </em>(1983) 463 U.S. 1121, 1125 [77 L.Ed.2d 1275, 1279, 103 S.Ct. 3517]; <em>Oregon </em>v. <em>Mathiason </em>(1977) 429 U.S. 492, 495 [50 L.Ed.2d 714, 719, 97 S.Ct. 711]; <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, supra, </em>384 U.S. at p. 444 [16 L.Ed.2d at p. 706].)</p>\n<p id=\"b966-4\">We find particularly instructive the United States Supreme Court\u2019s analysis in <em>Berkemer </em>v. <em>McCarty </em>(1984) 468 U.S. 420 [82 L.Ed.2d 317, 104 S.Ct 3138]. There, police effected a traffic stop because defendant\u2019s car was weaving. The officer asked defendant to exit his car, noticed he was unsteady on his feet, and had him perform a field sobriety test, which defendant failed. The officer directly asked the defendant whether he had been using intoxicants. The defendant replied that \u201c \u2018he had consumed two beers and had smoked several joints of marijuana a short time before.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 423 [82 L.Ed.2d at p. 423].)</p>\n<p id=\"b966-5\">On these facts, the United States Supreme Court held that <em>Miranda </em>warnings were not required before the officer questioned the defendant about his use of intoxicants.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-6\">The court acknowledged that a traffic stop is a \u201cseizure\u201d under the Fourth Amendment because it \u201csignificantly curtails the \u2018freedom of action\u2019 of the driver and the passengers, if any, of the detained vehicle.\u201d (468 U.S. at p. 436 [82 L.Ed.2d at p. 332].) Nevertheless, the court opined that a traffic stop did not exert upon a detained person pressures that sufficiently impair his free exercise of his privilege against self-incrimination to require that he be warned of his constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-7\">The court explained that a traffic stop is presumptively temporary and brief and roadside questioning is \u201cquite different from stationhouse interrogation, which frequently is prolonged, and in which the detainee often is aware that questioning will continue until he provides his interrogators the answers they seek.\u201d (468 U.S. at p. 438 [82 L.Ed.2d at pp. 333-334].) The court also noted that the circumstances of a traffic stop \u201care not such that the motorist feels completely at the mercy of the police.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 438 [82 L.Ed.2d at pp. 333-334].) The court further explained that although the \u201caura of authority surrounding an armed, uniformed officer\u201d exerts \u201csome pressure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1163\">*1163</page-number>on the detainee to respond to questions [,]\u201d this pressure is offset by the fact that (1) the encounter is in public, reducing the ability of police to use improperly coercive means to elicit incriminating statements; and (2) the detainee most typically will be confronted by only one or two officers, further reducing any sense of vulnerability. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 438 [82 L.Ed.2d at p. 333-334].)</p>\n<p id=\"b967-5\">Thus, since the \u201catmosphere surrounding an ordinary traffic stop is substantially less \u2018police dominated\u2019 than that surrounding the kinds of interrogation at issue in <em>Miranda </em>itself,\u201d the court held that \u201cpersons temporarily detained pursuant to such stops are not \u2018in custody\u2019 for the purposes of Miranda.\u201d (468 U.S. at pp. 438-439, 440 [82 L.Ed.2d at pp. 333-335].)</p>\n<p id=\"b967-6\">In this case, we focus on the circumstances present when Officer Richmond asked defendant if he was selling drugs. Using no more force than that projected by his uniform, Richmond, who was alone, asked defendant to stop on a public street in broad daylight Defendant was not formally arrested or led to believe the stop would not be brief. Nor was he told he was the focus of an investigation, confronted with incriminating evidence, or informed of Officer Torres\u2019s observations and belief. The length of the stop prior to defendant\u2019s arrest was very short.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-7\">The circumstances here are less indicative of custody than those attending the traffic stop in <em>Berkemer, </em>where an officer followed the defendant, forced his car to stop, and then required him to perform a field sobriety test. In our view, a reasonable person under the circumstances here\u2014a brief Terry<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> stop\u2014would not have understood himself to be \u201cin custody.\u201d Indeed, the court in <em>Berkemer </em>likened a traffic stop to a <em>Terry </em>stop, explaining, \u201cThe comparatively nonthreatening character of detentions of this sort explains the absence of any suggestion in our opinions that <em>Terry </em>stops are subject to the dictates of <em>Miranda.\" (Berkemer </em>v. <em>McCarty, supra, </em>468 U.S. at p. 440 [82 L.Ed.2d at pp. 334-335].)</p>\n<p id=\"b967-8\">Defendant argues that the indicia of a formal arrest were present in that the investigation had focused on him.  Although our Supreme Court has indicated that this fact is a relevant consideration in determining whether a defendant is in custody (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Morris, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d at p. 197; <em>People </em>v. <em>Boyer </em>(1989) 48 Cal.3d 247, 272 [256 Cal.Rptr. 96, 768 P.2d 610]), we recently explained in <em>People </em>v. <em>Bellomo </em>(1992) 10 Cal.App.4th 195 [10 Cal.Rptr.2d 782] that being \u201cthe focus of official investigation is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1164\">*1164</page-number>irrelevant to custody unless it is somehow communicated to the defendant.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at p. 200; <em>People </em>v. <em>Lopez </em>(1985) 163 Cal.App.3d 602, 606 [209 Cal.Rptr. 575]; see also <em>Berkemer </em>v. <em>McCarty, supra, </em>468 U.S. at p. 442 [82 L.Ed.2d at p. 336].)</p>\n<p id=\"b968-4\">Here, as noted above, there is no evidence defendant was aware of the officers\u2019 suspicions or even that Torres had been watching him. Moreover, although accusatory-type interrogation may communicate to a detainee that he or she is the focus of an investigation <em>(People </em>v. <em>Bellomo, supra, </em>10 Cal.App.4th at p. 200), we do not consider the single question asked by Officer Richmond sufficient by itself to do so in this case. (Cf. <em>Berkemer </em>v. <em>McCarty, supra, </em>468 U.S. 420, 423 [82 L.Ed.2d 317 at p. 324] [one question: Have you been using intoxicants?]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Merchant </em>(1968) 260 Cal.App.2d 875, 877 [67 Cal.Rptr. 459] [Are you an ex-convict? Do you have a gun in your possession?]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Aikens </em>(1977) 72 Cal.App.3d Supp. 11, Supp. 14 [140 Cal.Rptr. 135] [\u2018\u201cDoes anybody else have any weed?\u2019 \u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b968-5\">Defendant relies on <em>People </em>v. <em>Sims </em>(1980) 109 Cal.App.3d 900 [167 Cal.Rptr. 506], <em>People </em>v. <em>Herdan </em>(1974) 42 Cal.App.3d 300 [116 Cal.Rptr. 641], <em>People </em>v. <em>Layton </em>(1972) 29 Cal.App.3d 349 [105 Cal.Rptr. 509], and <em>People </em>v. <em>Abbott </em>(1970) 3 Cal.App.3d 966 [84 Cal.Rptr. 40] to support his claim that <em>Miranda </em>warnings were required. These cases are factually similar to this one. We note, however, that in each, the court concluded that warnings were required because, among other things, the defendant had been the focus of official investigation. As noted above, this fact is irrelevant unless communicated to the defendant. It does not appear that such communication occurred in any of these cases. If it did, then, of course, this case is distinguishable on that ground. If it did not, then we would decline to follow these cases because their analysis of custody now appears to be incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-6\">In sum, therefore, we conclude that <em>Miranda </em>warnings were not required in this case. It follows that the trial court did not err in failing to suppress the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1165\">*1165</page-number>evidence obtained as a result of defendant\u2019s answer to Officer Richmond\u2019s question.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b969-5\">\n<em>Disposition</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b969-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-7\">Cottle, P.

A motion to suppress physical evidence may properly be based on a claim that its seizure was improper under the Fourth Amendment because the seizure was the tainted product of an admission or confession that police obtained in violation of <em>Miranda.
