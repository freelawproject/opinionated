J.), P. J.</author>\n<p id=\"A0L\">Appellants/defendants Operation Rescue of Southern California (ORSC) and Greg Aakhus, Anna and Riccardo Lemos, and Garvan Kuskey (Aakhus) challenge the trial court\u2019s order awarding respondent/plaintiff Planned Parenthood of Santa Barbara, Ventura and San Luis Obispo Counties, Inc., attorney fees in the amount of $36,365 pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">Respondent provides medical counseling and services, and when appropriate, performs abortions on its premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">Beginning in 1989, appellants engaged in confrontational conduct at respondent\u2019s Santa Barbara clinic. They chased and obstructed the movement of vehicles of clinic patrons entering and leaving respondent\u2019s parking lot, and attempted to force anti-abortion literature and fetus dolls through the patrons\u2019 car windows. Appellants also chased, insulted and threatened, and photographed and videotaped respondent\u2019s patrons as they entered respondent\u2019s premises. They also entered respondent\u2019s building to convey their feelings to persons inside.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">Respondent obtained an injunction in a federal action prohibiting trespasses upon its property by anti-abortion demonstrators. Respondent sought to have the Santa Barbara District Attorney enforce the federal injunction against appellants herein. The district attorney refused, advising respondent to seek a state court injunction against the offending parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-9\">Pursuant to this advice respondent filed a complaint against appellants in September 1989, asking for damages, a temporary restraining order, preliminary and permanent injunctions, and attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-10\">A temporary restraining order was granted prohibiting appellants from trespassing onto respondent\u2019s property, and from touching or abusing any of respondent\u2019s clients whether on or off respondent\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-11\">Following a hearing on respondent\u2019s request for a preliminary injunction, the trial court found: (1) respondent\u2019s clinic and parking lot were not open to the public at large, but available only to respondent\u2019s patients, staff and invitees; (2) appellants admitted entering respondent\u2019s parking lot and clinic without respondent\u2019s consent; (3) appellants interfered with respondent\u2019s quiet use and enjoyment of its property, \u201cuse\u201d meaning the providing of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>health care services; and (4) appellants had an alternative means of communicating with respondent\u2019s clients by the public sidewalks bordering respondent\u2019s clinic.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">The court concluded in granting the preliminary injunction that \u201c[respondent] has proven that it will suffer irreparable injury to its property rights, and [respondent] and its patients will suffer irreparable injury to their fundamental rights guaranteed by the United States and California Constitutions, if a preliminary injunction does not issue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">Subsequently, respondent filed its first amended complaint asking for damages and a permanent injunction based on causes of action for trespass, tortious interference with business, public nuisance, and violation of state constitutional rights. According to appellants, respondent\u2019s original complaint pled a cause of action for conspiracy to violate federal constitutional laws. Appellants\u2019 demurrer to this cause of action was sustained. Respondent filed its first amended complaint omitting any federal constitutional claim.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">Respondent\u2019s cause of action for violation of state constitutional rights was based on the privacy guaranty pursuant to California Constitution, article I, section l.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Respondent alleged that appellants\u2019 conduct \u201cviolates and will violate a fundamental right to choose and obtain abortions guaranteed to all women, including women patients and clients of [respondent] .... Planned Parenthood has standing to assert and seek injunctive relief to protect the fundamental state constitutional rights of its women patients and clients. ... [][].. . [Appellants], and each of them, have threatened to continue their violation of the fundamental constitutional rights of [respondent\u2019s] women patients and clients.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">Appellants\u2019 answer to respondent\u2019s first amended complaint alleged that respondent\u2019s parking lot was not private for the purpose of exercising First Amendment rights, respondent did not have standing to assert its clients\u2019 constitutional right to privacy, respondent had not suffered any actual economic damages, and appellants\u2019 actions were protected by the First Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">Five months after appellants filed their answers, the parties signed a settlement agreement which resulted in the filing of a stipulated judgment. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>Pursuant to the agreement and judgment, appellants stipulated that a permanent injunction should be issued against them prohibiting them from trespassing onto respondent\u2019s property, impeding or obstructing access of respondent\u2019s clients to its facility, and placing signs or other tangible objects on respondent\u2019s property. The settlement agreement further provided that the trial court retained jurisdiction to rule on respondent\u2019s request for attorney fees in its first amended complaint, which issue was to be determined after a court trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">Following trial on the issue, the court awarded respondent attorney fees pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5.  In so ruling, the judge found that respondent\u2019s action resulted in the enforcement of a right affecting the public interest, the action conferred a significant benefit on the public or a large class of persons, the necessity and financial burden of the suit made an award of fees appropriate, and fees should be paid by the defendants in the interest of justice.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">The sole issue in this appeal is the correctness of the attorney fee award. Appellants Aakhus and ORSC contend the trial court abused its discretion by granting the award because respondent failed to establish that it met any of the requirements for the award pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5 (hereafter section 1021.5). They also argue that the stipulated judgment prevents the awarding of fees, since pursuant to the underlying settlement they admitted to no conduct upon which the award could be factually based.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">\n<em>Section 1021.5</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">Section 1021.5 codifies the private attorney general theory. <em>(Press </em>v. <em>Lucky Stores, Inc., supra, </em>34 Cal.3d 317.) Under the statute, three requirements must be met in order for a successful party to recover attorney fees: (1) the action has resulted in the enforcement of an important right affecting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>the public interest, (2) a significant benefit, whether pecuniary or nonpecuniary, has been conferred on the general public or a large class of persons, and (3) the necessity and financial burden of private enforcement make the award appropriate. (\u00a7 1021.5; <em>Woodland Hills Residents Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>City Council </em>(1979) 23 Cal.3d 917, 933-935 [154 Cal.Rptr. 503, 593 P.2d 200].)</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">Whether a plaintiff has proved each of the three prerequisites for an award of trial fees is a question best decided by the trial court. <em>(Schwartz </em>v. <em>City of Rosemead </em>(1984) 155 Cal.App.3d 547, 555 [202 Cal.Rptr. 400].) Its judgment will not be disturbed unless the appellate court is convinced that it is clearly wrong and constitutes an abuse of discretion. <em>(Inmates of Sybil Brand Institute for Women </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles </em>(1982) 130 Cal.App.3d 89, 114 [181 Cal.Rptr. 599]; <em>Committee to Defend Reproductive Rights </em>v. <em>A Free Pregnancy Center </em>(1991) 229 Cal.App.3d 633, 645 [280 Cal.Rptr. 329].)</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">\n<em>Important Right</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">Section 1021.5 permits an award in any action resulting in the enforcement of an important right\u2014whether constitutional, statutory or other\u2014 affecting the public interest. <em>(Woodland Hills Residents Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>City Council, supra, </em>23 Cal.3d at p. 925.)  Here, there can be no doubt that a fundamental constitutional principle was enforced or vindicated. <em>(Press </em>v. <em>Lucky Stores, Inc., supra, </em>34 Cal.3d at p. 319; <em>County of San Luis Obispo </em>v. <em>Abalone Alliance </em>(1986) 178 Cal.App.3d 848, 866 [223 Cal.Rptr. 846].)</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">Appellants state in their brief that their proscribed activities \u201cwere directed at the clients of respondent who appellants believed were entering respondent\u2019s facility in order to obtain an abortion.\u201d Implicit in this statement is the concession that appellants specifically entered onto respondent\u2019s private property to disrupt the exercise of the right to abortion.  The right to decide whether or not to bear a child is a fundamental constitutional right pursuant to the privacy guaranty of California Constitution, article I, section 1. <em>(Committee to Defend Reproductive Rights </em>v. <em>Myers </em>(1981) 29 Cal.3d 252, 262 [172 Cal.Rptr. 866, 625 P.2d 779, 20 A.L.R.4th 1118]; <em>American Academy of Pediatrics </em>v. <em>Van de Kamp </em>(1989) 214 Cal.App.3d 831, 836 [263 Cal.Rptr. 46].)</p>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">Appellants argue that the enforcement of an important public right did not occur here since this case dealt only with the issue of trespass onto respondent\u2019s property, and consequently, did not involve the constitutional issue of privacy or abortion. Even if an important public right was vindicated, they state it was only an indirect result of respondent\u2019s suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>Appellants misinterpret the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">First, their view that the trial judge remarked this case did not involve the right to abortion is without merit. The court commented only that this case was not concerned with the question of whether the right to abortion was wrong or right.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">Second, the constitutional issue of privacy was pled by respondent. Its first amended complaint alleged two distinct injuries, one to itself for appellants\u2019 alleged trespasses onto its property, and the other to its clients for appellants\u2019 alleged violation of their state privacy right to choose abortion.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">Third, in granting respondent a preliminary injunction, the trial court concluded in a written statement of reasons supporting the injunction that it would prevent irreparable injury to respondent\u2019s property rights <em>and </em>to respondent\u2019s patients\u2019 fundamental constitutional rights. The settlement agreement specifically states that the stipulated judgment shall adopt the \u201cidentical language\u201d of the preliminary injunction. Since the preliminary injunction is based on the aforementioned statement of reasons, we must presume in the absence of a contrary intent that the stipulated judgment also incorporates the court\u2019s reasons for the injunction. <em>(Denham </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 557, 564 [86 Cal.Rptr. 65, 468 P.2d 193].)</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">We conclude that the property issue appellants focus on was inextricably tied to the important state privacy right of abortion.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">\n<em>Significant Benefit</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b193-9\">Appellants next contend that the requirement of a significant benefit on the public or a large class was not met here, since the trial court had no evidence from which to conclude that any particular persons benefited from respondent\u2019s suit. Appellants point out that respondent did not present any data on the number of its clients, let alone those who obtained abortions at its Santa Barbara clinic. Thus, they argue, the stipulated judgment provides no precedential value.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-10\">Appellants misconstrue the law on this issue.  The evidence of the size of the population benefited by a private suit is not always required. The substantial benefit may be conceptual or doctrinal, and need not be actual and concrete, so long as the public is primarily benefited. <em>(Braude </em>v. <em>Automobile Club of Southern Cal. </em>(1986) 178 Cal.App.3d 994, 1011 [223 Cal.Rptr. 914].)</p>\n<p id=\"b193-11\">Although fundamental constitutional rights are by nature individual rights, their enforcement benefits the entire public. <em>(Press </em>v. <em>Lucky Stores, Inc., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number><em>supra, </em>34 Cal.3d at p. 319; <em>California Common Cause </em>v. <em>Duffy </em>(1987) 200 Cal.App.3d 730, 749 [246 Cal.Rptr. 285].) \u201cIndeed, only by protecting each individual\u2019s [fundamental rights] will society\u2019s general interests in these rights be secured.\u201d <em>(Press </em>v. <em>Lucky Stores, Inc., supra, </em>34 Cal.3d at p. 319.)</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">In this case, the benefit to the public was conceptual and overriding. Because respondent\u2019s suit helped to preserve a constitutional privacy right, it necessarily conferred a significant benefit on the public. <em>(County of San Luis Obispo </em>v. <em>Abalone Alliance, supra, </em>178 Cal.App.3d at p. 867.) Specifically, the stipulated judgment prohibited the performance of acts by appellants which were aimed at obstructing the exercise of the right to abortion. This benefits all women in the state by setting a precedent that their right to abortion includes the <em>right </em>in exercising this state constitutional guaranty to be free from interfering acts by members of the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">Appellants further claim that, even if the award of attorney fees had some impact on respondent\u2019s clients, there still was no proof of a significant benefit since none of respondent\u2019s clients failed to receive abortions due to appellants\u2019 conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">This proposition is unavailing. Proof by respondent of the actual deprivation of the right to abortion was unnecessary. Appellants\u2019 conduct, involving physical and verbal confrontations aimed directly at respondent\u2019s patrons and including the tactics of photographing and videotaping them, significantly and adversely affected the right to abortion. Such right would be a mere mockery under the law if the courts allowed its individual exercise to be challenged by organized public campaigns utilizing tactics of intimidation, humiliation and ridicule.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">Furthermore, by photographing and videotaping respondent\u2019s clients, appellants actually did deny them their right to privacy under the California Constitution.  Our state privacy guaranty, which is broader than the federal privacy right, protects information about a citizen\u2019s participation in a medical procedure, including abortion. <em>(Chico Feminist Women\u2019s Health Center </em>v. <em>Scully </em>(1989) 208 Cal.App.3d 230, 241-242 [256 Cal.Rptr. 194].) This protection extends to invasions of privacy by the state as well as private citizens. <em>(Id., </em>p. 242.)</p>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">\n<em>Burden of Litigation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b194-9\">This statutory element requires that the cost of the litigation to plaintiff be disproportionate to plaintiffs individual stake in the outcome. <em>(California Common Cause </em>v. <em>Duffy, supra, </em>200 Cal.App.3d at p. 750.) This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>criterion is met when the cost of the claimant\u2019s legal victory transcends his personal interest in the subject of the suit. <em>(County of San Luis Obispo </em>v. <em>Abalone Alliance, supra, </em>178 Cal.App.3d at p. 868.)</p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\">This element was fulfilled here. Since the district attorney refused to prosecute appellants without respondent first obtaining a state court injunction, respondent\u2019s suit was legally necessary. <em>(California Common Cause </em>v. <em>Duffy, supra, </em>200 Cal.App.3d at p. 751; <em>Save Oxnard Shores </em>v. <em>California Coastal Com. </em>(1986) 179 Cal.App.3d 140, 154 [224 Cal.Rptr. 425].) Further, respondent received no monetary recovery. <em>(Best </em>v. <em>California Apprenticeship Council </em>(1987) 193 Cal.App.3d 1448, 1469 [240 Cal.Rptr. 1]; <em>California Common Cause </em>v. <em>Duffy, supra, </em>at pp. 751-752.)</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">Appellants state that respondent had a sufficient business motive to wage this suit. We agree. Nevertheless, this does not mean that the effects of respondent\u2019s suit should be interpreted solely as a private success story. The interests of respondent and its clients, rendering and receiving reproductive medical care, are mutual and inseparable. This action was brought to protect both respondent and its patrons; consequently, it cannot be exclusively characterized as a self-serving, private dispute commenced by respondent to protect its own pocketbook. <em>(County of San Luis Obispo </em>v. <em>Abalone Alliance, supra, </em>178 Cal.App.3d at p. 868; <em>In re Marriage of McLucas </em>(1989) 210 Cal.App.3d 83, 91 [258 Cal.App. 133].)</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">\n<em>Stipulated Judgment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">Appellants next argue that the stipulated judgment prevents the awarding of attorney fees, citing <em>Isaacson </em>v. <em>California Ins. Guarantee Assn. </em>(1988) 44 Cal.3d 775, 794, footnote 14 [244 Cal.Rptr. 655, 750 P.2d 297], for the general rule that a settlement does not act as an admission of liability. They reason, that since they made no admission of either any <em>conduct </em>or <em>liability, </em>there is no support for the award in the record.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">Appellants appear to base their argument on the language of Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5 that attorney fees may be awarded \u201cto a <em>successful </em>party against one or more opposing parties . . . .\u201d (Italics added.) This provision means that the statutory right to attorney fees is limited to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>successful litigant. <em>(Residents Ad Hoc Stadium Com. </em>v. <em>Board of Trustees </em>(1979) 89 Cal.App.3d 274, 292 [152 Cal.Rptr. 585].) We presume, in the absence of any discussion by appellants as to this particular provision, that they believe respondent was not a \u201csuccessful party\u201d because appellants did not admit to any acts of wrongdoing. This implied position is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">Whether or not a party is successful depends upon whether the underlying action contributed substantially to remedying the conditions at which it was directed. <em>(Folsom </em>v. <em>Butte County Assn, of Governments </em>(1982) 32 Cal.3d 668, 671, 686-687 [186 Cal.Rptr. 589, 652 P.2d 437].) \u201cThe critical fact [establishing the propriety of an award] is the impact of the action, not the manner of its resolution. If the impact has been the \u2018enforcement of an important right affecting the public interest\u2019 and a consequent conferral of a \u2018significant benefit on the general public or a large class of persons\u2019 [fn. omitted] a section 1021.5 award is not barred because the case . . . was settled before trial.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 685.)</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">Here, the goal of respondent\u2019s suit was to stop appellants from entering onto its property and confronting its patrons by verbal and physical acts of persuasion. This objective was entirely achieved by the stipulated judgment which permanently enjoins appellants from trespassing onto respondent\u2019s parking lot, from standing in the driveway to respondent\u2019s parking lot to impede the movement of vehicles entering or leaving, from trespassing into respondent\u2019s building, and from touching or obstructing the movement of respondent\u2019s patrons on or off respondent\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">We conclude that the injunction makes respondent a \u201csuccessful party\u201d pursuant to section 1021.5.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>(Sokolow </em>v. <em>County of San Mateo, supra, </em>213 Cal.App.3d at p. 245.)</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">Appellants also err by focusing the issue of attorney fees on their asserted nonliability. An opposing party\u2019s admission or nonadmission of liability is irrelevant for purposes of an award pursuant to section 1021.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">The statute contains no language requiring as a prerequisite that the opposing party admit to legal wrongdoing.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-9\">Just as significantly, our Supreme Court has ruled that a claimant settling a lawsuit may be a \u201csuccessfiil party\u201d under the statute. <em>(Folsom </em>v. <em>Butte </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number><em>County Assn, of </em>Governments, supra, 32 Cal.3d at p. 671.) Attorney fees are \u201cproperly awarded after entry of a stipulated judgment, unless expressly or by necessary implication excluded by the stipulation.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 678.)  Here, of course, the stipulated judgment expressly preserved subsequent litigation of the question of respondent\u2019s right to attorney fees, so there was no waiver of the fee issue. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 680.)</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">Our decision to affirm the trial court\u2019s award of attorney fees to respondent is <em>not </em>premised, as appellants argue, on an admission of <em>liability. </em>Our opinion is based on the record documenting that appellants committed certain <em>acts </em>on respondent\u2019s property. This does not signify that appellants made any admission of <em>liability </em>for such acts. The words \u201cact\u201d and \u201cliability\u201d are not interchangeable. One may agree that they have engaged in certain conduct without admitting to the legal nature of such conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">The trial court\u2019s award of attorney fees does not constitute an abuse of its discretion; no statute or legal rule or principle prohibits the award, nor does it constitute a miscarriage of justice. <em>(Baggett </em>v. <em>Gates </em>(1982) 32 Cal.3d 128, 142-143 [185 Cal.Rptr. 232, 649 P.2d 874].)</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">The award fulfills all of the requirements of section 1021.5. <em>(Press </em>v. <em>Lucky Stores, Inc., supra, </em>34 Cal.3d at p. 321.) Moreover, it does not chill appellants\u2019 free speech rights, since respondent\u2019s private property is not open to the general public. <em>(Robins </em>v. <em>Pruneyard Shopping Center </em>(1979) 23 Cal.3d 899 [153 Cal.Rptr. 854, 592 P.2d 341].)  Private medical facilities not devoted to general public use are under no constitutional burden to guarantee individuals access for the purpose of physical or verbal expression. <em>(Planned Parenthood </em>v. <em>Wilson </em>(1991) 234 Cal.App.3d 1662, 1674 [286 Cal.Rptr. 427].) The exercise of the right to free speech at private abortion clinics is appropriate only \u201cwithin the traditional public forum of the public sidewalk.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">In addition, since section 1021.5 is applied generally to all government and nongovernment persons and entities in California <em>(County of Fresno </em>v. <em>Lehman </em>(1991) 229 Cal.App.3d 340, 349 [280 Cal.Rptr. 310]), appellants\u2019 status here as private parties is not a reason precluding the award. (See also <em>Luck </em>v. <em>Southern Pacific Transportation Co. </em>(1990) 218 Cal.App.3d 1, 17-18 [267 Cal.Rptr. 618] and <em>Wilkinson </em>v. <em>Times Mirror Corp. </em>(1989) 215 Cal.App.3d 1034, 1040 [264 Cal.Rptr. 194], holding that the state right to privacy in art. I, \u00a7 1 of the Cal. Const, guarantees protection against both governmental and nongovernmental conduct.)</p>\n<p id=\"b198-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>Finally, there is no evidence in this case that the amount of the award itself is improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">Since we find no factual or legal basis for reversing the trial court\u2019s order awarding attorney fees to respondent, the order is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">Costs are awarded to respondent as the prevailing party. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 26(a).) We further grant respondent\u2019s request for attorney fees on appeal, the amount to be decided by the trial court. Respondent\u2019s request for attorney fees concerning its response to appellants\u2019 petition for rehearing is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">Gilbert, J., and Yegan, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">Appellants\u2019 petitions for review by the Supreme Court were denied June 3, 1993. Panelli, J., was of the opinion that the petitions should be granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b190-9\"> Neither respondent\u2019s original complaint nor appellants\u2019 demurrer thereto is included in the record in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b190-10\"> The section reads: \u201cAll people are by nature free and independent and have inalienable rights.

The statute provides in pertinent part: \u201cUpon motion, a court may award attorney\u2019s fees to a successful party against one or more opposing parties in any action which has resulted in the enforcement of an important right affecting the public interest if: (a) a significant benefit, whether pecuniary or nonpecuniary, has been conferred on the general public or a large class of persons, (b) the necessity and financial burden of private enforcement are such as to make the award appropriate, and (c) such fees should not in the interest of justice be paid out of the recovery, if any.\u201d Subdivision (c) is inapplicable if, as here, there was no monetary recovery. <em>(Press </em>v. <em>Lucky Stores, Inc. </em>(1983) 34 Cal.3d 311, 318, fn. 5 [193 Cal.Rptr. 900, 667 P.2d 704].) Therefore, the court\u2019s finding that the interest of justice requires appellants to pay the fees was not mandated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b195-9\"> The claim that appellants committed no acts on respondent\u2019s property is disingenuous and therefore needs no detailed discussion. The facts that appellants entered onto respondent\u2019s property and attempted to dissuade respondent\u2019s patrons from obtaining abortions are well documented by the superior court record as well as both parties\u2019 briefs on appeal. Appellants\u2019 defense in the trial court was not a denial of their acts; instead, they insisted they were simply exercising their constitutional rights to free speech. They further claimed respondent had no standing to assert the constitutional rights of its clients.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b196-10\"> Although respondent asked for damages but received no pecuniary benefit, the thrust of its suit was to stop appellant\u2019s documented activities. Respondent\u2019s request for damages merely constituted an alternative or additional remedial theory to injunction. <em>(Sokolow </em>v. <em>County of San Mateo </em>(1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 231, 249-250 [261 Cal.Rptr. 520].) Since the injunction was achieved, respondent can not be held to have been unsuccessful with regard to the primary objective of its action. <em>(Id., </em>p. at p. 249.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
