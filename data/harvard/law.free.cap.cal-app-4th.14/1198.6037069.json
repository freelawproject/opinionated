J.</author>\n<p id=\"AeV\">Donald Lynn Ellis appeals from the judgment entered following his plea of guilty to driving a motor vehicle with a blood-alcohol level of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1200\">*1200</page-number>more than .08 percent with five prior convictions of driving a motor vehicle under the influence (Veh. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 23152, subd. (b), 23175) and his admission of a prior felony conviction for which he served a separate prison term (Pen. Code, \u00a7 667.5, subd. (b)). Prior thereto, he unsuccessfully brought a suppression motion pursuant to Penal Code section 1538.5. He contends: \u201cThe suppression motion should have been granted because the detention was improper.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-4\">\u201cWe view the evidence in the light most favorable to the order denying suppression which is required by the familiar rule governing appellate review. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Renteria </em>(1992) 2 Cal.App.4th 440, 442 [2 Cal.Rptr.2d 925].) At approximately 2 a.m. on June 13, 1992, Port Hueneme Police Officer Steven Hart was on routine patrol when he saw appellant driving a Jeep Cherokee in a commercial parking lot, near a USA gas station, adjacent to Ventura Road. The jeep\u2019s headlamps were not turned on. Hart used his overhead red lights to attract appellant\u2019s attention to effect \u201c. . . a traffic stop to tell the subject to turn on his lights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-5\">When Hart asked appellant for his driver\u2019s license, appellant replied that he did not have one. Hart noticed that appellant\u2019s breath smelled of alcohol, his eyes were bloodshot and watery and his speech was slurred. Hart asked appellant to step out of his vehicle and appellant said: \u201cYou have got me. Go ahead and take me in.\u201d When Hart asked appellant why he should be arrested, appellant answered: \u201cBecause I am drunk.\u201d After administering field sobriety tests and forming the opinion that appellant was under the influence of alcohol, Hart arrested appellant. Appellant\u2019s blood-alcohol level was subsequently determined to be .24 percent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-6\">Appellant moved to suppress the evidence of his intoxication, arguing that Hart illegally detained him. His theory was that driving without headlamps in violation of Vehicle Code section 24400 is not one of the provisions of the Vehicle Code which can be enforced in privately owned parking lots pursuant to Vehicle Code section 21107.8.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellant\u2019s counsel pointed out that there had been no showing of a sign or an ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-7\">The prosecutor responded: \u201c[Ajssuming that counsel\u2019s argument is correct, and that is not something that the officer could cite for, . . . Nevertheless, I think that the officer certainly had rational suspicion to stop the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1201\">*1201</page-number>defendant, at a minimum to tell him to put on the lights, [ft] . . . The officer would be remiss to sit and let him go out on a city street with his lights off and then decide that he should stop him. If he were to sit and wait for him to actually get on a city street and then effect a stop and an accident were to occur, the ramifications of that would be horrific, [ft] . . . What counsel is saying may very well be a defense to a driving without lights citation in that parking lot. I don\u2019t think it in any way, shape or form says that that\u2019s an illegal detention.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-5\">The trial court stated: \u201cWhat the Court is looking at, and mindful that the test is objective, the Court\u2019s looking at Vehicle Code Section 24400 which reads, \u2018During darkness\u2014\u201cand clearly it was. It was 1:56 a.m.\u201d\u2014every motor vehicle, other than a motorcycle, shall be equipped with at least two lighted headlamps . . . .\u2019 [ft] That\u2019s an infraction and it\u2019s not limited to the highway. So I am basing the denial of the motion on Section 24400.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-6\">Appellant\u2019s counsel asked the court if it felt \u201cthat the 24400 is included in 21107.8[.]\u201d The trial court answered, \u201cI think 21107.8 is not all inclusive. I think it lists specifically the specific Vehicle Code sections that can be enforced, the 23101 [\u2019]s, speed contests, et cetera.\u201d Defense counsel responded, \u201cThe fact that the People made no showing about the ordinance, resolution or posting, it appears that that\u2019s something that they are required to do to justify a stop even for the listed sections.\u201d The trial court replied, \u201cI think it\u2019s of no moment to 24400.1 don\u2019t think the People have to show that for the 24400. At least as I read it.\u201d The trial court denied the suppression motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-7\">Appellant\u2019s contention that the trial court erroneously denied his suppression motion is without merit. Appellant was driving at night without lighted headlamps in violation of Vehicle Code section 24400. Even were we to determine that the trial court erred in finding driving without lighted headlamps in this parking lot to be a citeable traffic infraction, the denial of the motion was justified.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201c[W]e review the trial court\u2019s rulings[,] not its reasoning. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Mason </em>(1991) 52 Cal.3d 909, 944 [277 Cal.Rptr. 166, 802 P.2d 950].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-8\">Hart activated his overhead lights and stopped appellant to remind him to turn on his headlamps, not to cite him for a traffic violation. Stopping appellant was the most effective means to assure that he would turn on his lights before driving on the street. We agree with the prosecutor\u2019s commonsense argument made at the suppression hearing.  In view of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1202\">*1202</page-number>the potential harm to the public if appellant drove on a public street without headlamps on, Hart\u2019s detention of appellant was reasonable.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1006-4\">\u201cIn order to justify a detention \u2018the circumstances known or apparent to the officer must include specific and articulable facts causing him to suspect that (1) <em>some activity relating to crime </em>has taken place or <em>is </em>occurring or <em>about to occur, </em>and (2) the person he intends to stop or detain is involved in that activity.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Aldridge </em>(1984) 35 Cal.3d 473, 478 [198 Cal.Rptr. 538, 674 P.2d 240], italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-5\">Officer Hart was not required to wait until appellant actually drove upon a public street to stop appellant. Just as the decision to detain \u201c. . . need not be supported by the actual belief in guilt required to arrest, book, and jail an individual on a named criminal charge . . .\u201d <em>(In re Tony C. </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 888, 892 [582 P.2d 957]), it need not be supported by the actual belief in guilt required to cite on a named violation of the Vehicle Code. Had Hart waited for appellant to drive on a public street, and had a traffic collision occurred, Hart would have been subject to justifiable criticism. While Hart could not, perhaps, legally cite appellant in the parking lot, appellant\u2019s driving without his headlamps on was activity \u201crelating\u201d to a violation of Vehicle Code section 24400 and it was \u201cabout to occur\u201d on a public street. The suppression motion was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-7\">Stone (S. J.), P. J., and Gilbert, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1004-8\"> Vehicle Code section 21107.8 permits the enforcement in privately owned parking lots, after enactment of appropriate local legislation and the posting of notice, of certain Vehicle Code statutes which specifically refer to conduct on the highway. The statutes which can be so enforced relate to the basic speed law (Veh. Code, \u00a7 22350), reckless driving (Veh. Code, \u00a7 23103), speed contests (Veh. Code, \u00a7 23109), and off-highway vehicles (Veh. Code, \u00a7 38000 et seq.).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1005-9\"> The Attorney General concedes that the officer could not lawfully cite appellant for violating Vehicle Code section 24400 in this parking lot.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1006-8\"> At oral argument, both appellant and the Attorney General agreed that appellant was \u201cdetained\u201d in the parking lot. Notwithstanding the officer\u2019s initial motivation, we also agree that appellant was detained. \u201c[T]he police can be said to have seized an individual \u2018only if, in view of all of the circumstances surrounding the incident, a reasonable person would have believed that he was not free to leave.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Michigan </em>v. <em>Chesternut </em>(1988) 486 U.S. 567, 573 [100 L.Ed.2d 565, 572, 108 S.Ct. 1975].) Where, as here, an officer activates the overhead red lights of his police car, stops the car, and asks the driver for his or her license, a reasonable person would believe that he or she is not free to leave.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
