Plaintiff executed listing agreements, real estate disclosure statements, and real estate purchase contracts which advised him that defendant\u2019s responsibilities as a broker did not include giving advice on tax consequences of the transactions. After the transactions were completed, plaintiff was informed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>by his accountant that plaintiff incurred a tax liability of approximately $34,000 because the transactions were not structured to qualify as tax-deferred exchanges under Internal Revenue Code section 1031. (26 U.S.C. \u00a7 1031; hereafter section 1031.)</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">Plaintiff then brought this professional negligence action, alleging in substance that defendant \u201cfailed to exercise reasonable care and skill in undertaking her duties as a broker\u201d by neglecting to warn plaintiff his transactions could have adverse tax consequences and by failing to structure the transactions as tax-deferred exchanges.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">Defendant filed a motion for summary judgment on the ground \u201cplaintiff cannot establish duty or breach of duty as a matter of law.\u201d The trial court granted the motion, ruling: \u201cDefendant Tortosa was in a fiduciary relationship with plaintiff. This relationship was defined by the documents [executed by plaintiff]. ...[][] These documents evidence the nature of the fiduciary relationship between defendant and plaintiff [which] did not include a separate responsibility on the part of defendant to advise plaintiff Earnest <em>[sic] </em>Carleton on tax matters, but rather, specifically excluded the provision of tax advice from the scope of defendant Tortosa\u2019s duty to plaintiff. Plaintiff Carleton was specifically instructed to look to other professionals for tax advice. Thus, defendant Tortosa had no affirmative duty to provide tax advice to plaintiff Carleton or to structure the escrows of the subject transactions in such a way as to reap the greatest tax benefits to him. Such advice is strictly outside the scope of a real estate agent\u2019s fiduciary duty to her client.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">Plaintiff appeals from the order and judgment. He claims a real estate broker\u2019s duty to exercise reasonable skill and care for the benefit of the client extends to advising the client that a transaction could have adverse tax consequences and recognizing the need for a tax-deferred exchange. According to plaintiff, the use of \u201c \u2018boilerplate\u2019 disclaimers\u201d in the listing agreements, disclosure forms and purchase contracts stating a real estate broker is not responsible for giving tax advice did not relieve defendant of the duty to warn plaintiff that his proposed transactions were in the nature of \u201can IRC 1031 Delayed Exchange and [to advise plaintiff] to secure the assistance of outside professionals in the event that [defendant] could not competently handle the transaction.\u201d (Italics omitted.) This is so, he argues, because any contractual provision relieving a real estate broker of the duty to recognize and alert a client to potential tax consequences of a transaction violates public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">As we shall explain in the published portion of this opinion, aside from obligations imposed by statute and implementing regulations, a real estate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>broker\u2019s duty is derived from the agreement between the broker and client. In this case, the parties\u2019 agreement in effect specified that defendant had no duty to recognize and advise plaintiff regarding the potential tax consequences of his transactions. Contrary to plaintiff\u2019s claim, this contractual provision did not violate public policy because the Legislature has determined that sellers and buyers of real estate should obtain tax advice from professionals other than real estate brokers. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 2375.) In the unpublished part of this opinion, we reject plaintiffs contention that the trial court erred in ordering plaintiff to pay defendant\u2019s attorney fees. Accordingly, we shall affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">Plaintiff is a teacher of high school English and foreign languages with 25 years\u2019 experience in real estate investing. With the professional assistance of defendant, plaintiff had invested in Winters, California, for five or six years prior to the present transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">On April 17, 1990, plaintiff executed an \u201cExclusive Authorization and Right to Sell\u201d (listing agreement) to sell his property at 1028 Adams in Winters. The property was sold and escrow closed on May 29, 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-8\">On April 25, 1990, plaintiff contracted to purchase property at 467 Edwards in Winters. Escrow closed on June 18, 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-9\">On June 14, 1990, plaintiff executed a listing agreement to sell his property at 1001 Adams in Winters. The property was sold and escrow closed on August 15, 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-10\">On July 5, 1990, plaintiff contracted to purchase property at 1103 Hoover in Winters. Escrow closed on August 28, 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-11\">The listing agreements for the sales of the properties at 1028 Adams and 1001 Adams advised plaintiff: \u201cA real estate broker is the person qualified to advise on real estate. If you desire legal or tax advice, consult an appropriate professional.\u201d For each of the four transactions defendant furnished plaintiff a written \u201cDisclosure Regarding Real Estate Agency Relationships\u201d which advised plaintiff: \u201cThe above duties of the agent in a real estate transaction do not relieve a Seller or a Buyer from the responsibility to protect their [sic] own interests. You should carefully read all agreements to assure that they adequately express your understanding of the transaction. A real estate agent is a person qualified to advise about real estate. If legal or tax advice is desired, consult a competent professional.\u201d In addition, for each of the four <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>transactions plaintiff executed a \u201cReal Estate Purchase Contract and Receipt for Deposit\u201d which advised him: \u201cLegal and Tax Advice: A real estate broker or agent is qualified to advise on real estate. If you require legal or tax advice, consult your attorney or accountant. No representation or recommendations are made by the broker, agents, or employees as to the legal sufficiency, effect, or tax consequences of this document or the transaction relating thereto. These questions are for your attorney and or your accountant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">During the course of the transactions, plaintiff asked defendant how many days he had to reinvest the proceeds of the two sales in order to avoid paying capital gains tax. Defendant answered: \u201cI don\u2019t know. . . . Ask your tax person.\u201d Plaintiff called his accountant. \u201c[T]he tax lady that does [his] taxes wasn\u2019t in, so [he] talked to her assistant, and she said [he had] forty-five days [to reinvest].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">After the transactions were completed, plaintiff\u2019s accountant prepared plaintiffs income tax returns and informed him he incurred a capital gains tax liability of approximately $34,000. The transactions failed to qualify as tax-deferred exchanges because they were not conducted through a third party intermediary.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b660-8\">\u201cSince a summary judgment motion raises only questions of law regarding the construction and effect of the supporting and opposing papers, we independently review them on appeal, applying the same three-step analysis required of the trial court. . . .  First, we identify the issues framed by the pleadings since it is these allegations to which the motion must respond by establishing a complete defense or otherwise showing there is no factual basis for relief on any theory reasonably contemplated by the opponent\u2019s pleading. ...[][] Second[], we determine whether the moving party\u2019s showing has established facts which negate the opponent\u2019s claim and justify a judgment in movant\u2019s favor. ...  The motion must stand self-sufficient and cannot succeed because the opposition is weak. ... A party cannot succeed without disproving even those claims on which the opponent would have the burden of proof at trial. ...[][]  When a summary judgment motion prima facie justifies a judgment, the third and final step is to determine whether the opposition demonstrates the existence of a triable, material factual issue. ...  Counteraffidavits and declarations need not prove the opposition\u2019s case; they suffice if they disclose the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>existence of a triable issue.\u201d <em>(AARTS Productions, Inc. </em>v. <em>Crocker National Bank </em>(1986) 179 Cal.App.3d 1061, 1064-1065 [225 Cal.Rptr. 203], citations omitted; see <em>FPI Development, Inc. </em>v. <em>Nakashima </em>(1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 367, 381-382 [282 Cal.Rptr. 508].)</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">Plaintiffs complaint alleges defendant was negligent in two respects: in preparing the deposit receipts and structuring the escrows; and in failing to tell plaintiff of defendant\u2019s lack of expertise in structuring tax-deferred real estate exchanges and by further failing to advise plaintiff to seek other professional assistance in structuring the transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">The issue framed by each theory of liability relates to defendant\u2019s failure to inform plaintiff of the tax consequences of his transactions. Plaintiff contends defendant had a duty to \u201crecogniz[e] a tax-free exchange setting\u201d and to \u201cdirect[] the client to an exchange company if [defendant] did not possess the requisite expertise.\u201d (Italics omitted.)  According to plaintiff, defendant \u201cat least had an obligation to \u2018issue-spot\u2019 or warn Plaintiff about the capital gains consequences of proceeding without adequate advice . . . .\u201d (Italics omitted.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b662-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>In her motion for summary judgment, defendant asserted she negated plaintiffs claims of negligence by showing she had no duty to prepare the escrows and structure the deposit receipts so. as to minimize adverse tax consequences, she had no duty to advise plaintiff of her lack of experience with tax-deferred exchanges, and she fulfilled any duty to advise him to seek other professional assistance regarding the tax consequences of the transactions. In support of her motion for summary judgment, defendant submitted excerpts from plaintiff\u2019s deposition, his responses to interrogatories and requests for admissions, and documentation from numerous real estate transactions in which plaintiff participated as buyer or seller, including those here in issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">We agree with the trial court that defendant\u2019s showing established facts which negated plaintiffs claims and justified a judgment in defendant\u2019s favor. <em>(AARTS Productions, supra, </em>179 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1064-1065.)</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">\u201cThe elements of a cause of action for negligence are commonly stated as (1) a legal duty to use due care; (2) a breach of that duty; (3) a reasonably close causal connection between that breach and the. resulting injury; and (4) actual loss or damage.\u201d <em>(Ahem </em>v. <em>Dillenback </em>(1991) 1 Cal.App.4th 36, 42 [1 Cal.Rptr.2d 339]; 6 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (9th ed. 1988) Torts, \u00a7 732, p. 60.) Failure to prove any one of these elements is fatal to plaintiff\u2019s recovery. <em>(Banerian </em>v. <em>O\u2019Malley </em>(1974) 42 Cal.App.3d 604, 612 [116 Cal.Rptr. 919].)</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">Whether a legal duty of care exists in a given factual situation is a question of law to be determined by the court, not the jury. <em>(Ballard </em>v. <em>Uribe </em>(1986) 41 Cal.3d 564, 572, fn. 6 [224 Cal.Rptr. 664, 715 P.2d 624]; <em>Ahem, supra, </em>1 Cal.App.4th at p. 42; <em>Clarke </em>v. <em>Hoek </em>(1985) 174 Cal.App.3d 208, 213 [219 Cal.Rptr. 845].)  Where a duty is found to exist, a real estate agent must fulfill it by exhibiting the degree of care and skill ordinarily exhibited by professionals in the industry. (2 Miller &amp; Starr, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>\u00a7 3:17, pp. 94-95; <em>Montoya </em>v. <em>McLeod </em>(1985) 176 Cal.App.3d 57, 65 [221 Cal.Rptr. 353]; <em>Timmsen </em>v. <em>Forest E. Olson, Inc. </em>(1970) 6 Cal.App.3d 860, 871 [86 Cal.Rptr. 359]; <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Carman </em>(1960) 179 Cal.App.2d 63, 68 [3 Cal.Rptr. 612].)</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">The degree of care and skill required to fulfill a professional duty ordinarily is a question of fact and may require testimony by professionals in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>the field if the matter is within the knowledge of experts only. <em>(Miller </em>v. <em>Los Angeles County Flood Control Dist. </em>(1973) 8 Cal.3d 689, 702 [106 Cal.Rptr. 1, 505 P.2d 193]; see <em>Carson </em>v. <em>Facilities Development Co. </em>(1984) 36 Cal.3d 830, 844-845 [206 Cal.Rptr. 136, 686 P.2d 656].)  However, expert testimony is incompetent on the predicate question whether the duty exists because this is a question of law for the court alone. <em>(Clarke, supra, </em>174 Cal.App.3d at p. 214.)  Plaintiffs contention that the trial court erroneously disregarded \u201ccustom and practice testimony, i.e., the testimony of other professionals in the same field,\u201d fails because, for reasons which follow, the trial court properly concluded defendant had no duty to structure the transaction to minimize plaintiffs tax liability or to advise him of her lack of expertise with section 1031 exchanges.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">Real estate brokers are subject to two sets of duties: those imposed by regulatory statutes, and those arising from the general law of agency. (2 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>Agency and Employment, \u00a7 253, pp. 245-246.) Plaintiff does not contend defendant failed to f\u00fclfill a duty imposed by statute or implementing regulation (e.g., Civ. Code, \u00a7 1102 et seq. [agent\u2019s duty to inspect property; disclosure requirements]). Thus, he must derive defendant\u2019s duty from the general law of agency, i.e., from the agreement between the principal and agent.  \u201cThe existence and extent of the duties of the agent to the principal are determined by the terms of the agreement between the parties, interpreted in light of the circumstances under which it is made, except to the extent that fraud, duress, illegality, or the incapacity of one or both of the parties to the agreement modifies it or deprives it of legal effect.\u201d (Rest.2d Agency, \u00a7 376; <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Badger </em>(1948) 84 Cal.App.2d 736, 741 [191 P.2d 768]; 3 Cal.Jur.3d, Agency, \u00a7 87, pp. 119-120; cf. <em>Ahem, supra, </em>1 Cal.App.4th at p. 43 [insurance agent owes duties normally found in agency relationship].)</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">Plaintiffs agreement with defendant is contained in the listing agreements, disclosure statements and purchase contracts described above. Plaintiff admitted each document was genuine, stated he read each document prior to signing, acknowledged he understood each document was legally significant, and admitted defendant did nothing to prevent him from reading each document in its entirety. Plaintiff claimed he only \u201cglanced through\u201d some of the documents because \u201c[i]t is a bore to read through these kinds of real estate transactions.\u201d  However, his failure to read the documents does not permit him to avoid their legal effect, and plaintiff does not contend otherwise. (E.g., <em>Bolanos </em>v. <em>Khalatian </em>(1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 1586, 1590 [283 Cal.Rptr. 209].)</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">The listing agreements for sales of the properties at 1028 Adams and 1001 Adams told plaintiff that defendant, a real estate broker, was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>\u201cqualified to advise on real estate,\u201d but informed plaintiff he should \u201cconsult an appropriate professional\u201d if he desired legal or tax advice. The real estate agency disclosure forms advised plaintiff to \u201ccarefully read all agreements to assure that they adequately express your understanding of the transaction,\u201d and reiterated that \u201c[a] real estate agent is a person qualified to advise about real estate. If legal or tax advice is desired, consult a competent professional.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The real estate purchase contracts informed plaintiff that \u201c[a] real estate broker or agent is qualified to advise on real estate. If you require legal or tax advice, consult your attorney or accountant.\u201d Moreover, the contracts specifically advised plaintiff that \u201c[n]o representation or recommendations are made by the broker, agents, or employees as to the legal sufficiency, effect, or tax consequences of this document or the transaction relating thereto. These questions are for your attorney and or your accountant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">These documents negate plaintiff\u2019s claim of duty. His allegation that defendant had a duty to prepare the deposit receipts and structure the escrows in a manner which would minimize plaintiff\u2019s tax liability is negated by the purchase contracts\u2019 provision stating the broker makes no representation or recommendation as to the tax consequences of the transaction. Were defendant subject to the alleged duty, she necessarily would \u201crepresent\u201d she has structured the transaction to minimize any adverse tax consequences. This is precisely what the document states the broker does not do.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">Plaintiff\u2019s claim that defendant had a duty to inform him of her lack of expertise with section 1031 exchanges and to advise him to seek other professional help in that regard is negated by the documents\u2019 provisions stating a broker is qualified to advise on real estate but legal or tax advice should be obtained from a \u201ccompetent professional,\u201d an \u201cattorney and or . . . accountant.\u201d These documents also provide the very advisement which plaintiff claims defendant should have given: that plaintiff should \u201cseek other professional assistance\u201d regarding tax consequences of the transactions here at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">Likewise, plaintiff\u2019s allegation that defendant had a duty to \u201cissue-spot\u201d or warn him regarding tax consequences of the transactions is at odds with the documents\u2019 admonition that plaintiff should get his tax advice elsewhere. (Cf. <em>Ahem, supra, </em>1 Cal.App.4th 36 [absent some conduct on the part of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>agent consistent with assuming broader duties, the agent\u2019s duties are limited to those arising out of the contract].)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">This case is similar to <em>Santos </em>v. <em>Wing </em>(1961) 197 Cal.App.2d 678 [17 Cal.Rptr. 457], where sellers of property were dissatisfied because, as structured, the sale had unfortunate tax consequences. In rejecting sellers\u2019 effort to hold the real estate agents responsible, the court explained: \u201cWe do not find in the evidence any suggestion that the [agents] had any knowledge of the appellants\u2019 tax situation, or what if any tax might result to the appellants from this sale. The [agents] did not attempt to give the appellants any tax advice. On the contrary, they urged appellants to seek counsel; the appellants did have an accountant and they had an attorney, and the appellant Santos held the seller\u2019s instructions in his possession for several days for the announced purpose of seeking legal advice.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 684.) Here, as in <em>Santos, </em>defendant real estate broker did not attempt to give tax advice.  Rather, she repeatedly advised plaintiff in writing to seek tax advice from an attorney or accountant.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">Citing <em>Tunkl </em>v. <em>Regents of University of California </em>(1963) 60 Cal.2d 92, 98-101 and <em>Akin </em>v. <em>Business Title Corp. </em>(1968) 264 Cal.App.2d 153, 158-159 [70 Cal.Rptr. 287], plaintiff contends the disclaimer language in the listing agreements, disclosure statements and purchase contracts should be disregarded. <em>Tunkl </em>and <em>Akin </em>hold that contractual language exculpating a party from responsibility for its future negligence is invalid under Civil Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>section 1668 where the contract affects a public interest. <em>(Tunkl, supra, </em>60 Cal.2d at pp. 96, 101-104 [a release from liability for fiiture negligence imposed as a condition for admission to a charitable research hospital is invalid as contrary to the public interest]; <em>Akin, supra, </em>264 Cal.App.2d at p. 159.)</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">Plaintiff\u2019s reliance on <em>Tunkl </em>and <em>Akin </em>is misplaced. In this case, the contractual language does not exculpate defendant from her negligence, i.e., from her breach of an extant duty of care. Rather, the contractual language in effect specifies that a real estate broker <em>has no duty </em>to provide legal or tax advice. Thus, the failure to provide such information is not negligence, and the rules governing exculpation from negligence do not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">Nevertheless, plaintiff suggests that any contractual provision relieving real estate brokers of a duty to recognize and alert a client to the potential tax consequences of a transaction violates public policy. (Cf. <em>Easton </em>v. <em>Strassburger </em>(1984) 152 Cal.App.3d 90 [199 Cal.Rptr. 383] [holding broker has duty to inspect premises; later codified in Civ. Code \u00a7 1102 et seq.]; see also <em>Schoenberg </em>v. <em>Romike Properties </em>(1967) 251 Cal.App.2d 154, 162 [59 Cal.Rptr. 359] [duty to investigate property to determine its value].) According to plaintiff, \u201ccurrent real estate practice\u201d dictates that a real estate professional has a duty to recognize tax consequences of a transaction and to structure tax-deferred exchanges when appropriate. He points to evidence that defendant was familiar with tax-deferred exchanges, had taken a class entitled \u201cUnmasking and Masking and Creatively Protecting Clients in Exchanges,\u201d and had attended a seminar on \u201cTax Aspects of Real Estate.\u201d Plaintiff claims that, because brokers hold themselves out to the public as possessing special knowledge in real estate transactions and \u201cgiven the evolution of the real estate profession into new and emerging fields (including [tax-deferred exchanges]),\u201d public policy requires brokers to have a duty to recognize and advise clients of the tax consequences of their transactions and of the need for tax-deferred exchanges.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">This contention fails because the Legislature has determined that public policy expects sellers and buyers to obtain tax advice from professionals other than real estate brokers. By enacting Civil Code section 2375, the Legislature has mandated that buyers and sellers be told: \u201cA real estate agent is a person qualified to advise about real estate. If legal or tax advice is desired, consult a competent professional.\u201d We decline to conclude that public policy requires real estate brokers to provide tax advice when the Legislature has determined that such advice should be sought from other competent professionals.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">Plaintiff also claims the \u201cboilerplate\u201d language in his contracts stating defendant was not responsible for giving tax advice is adhesive and, thus, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>should be disregarded.  \u201cA contract of adhesion has been defined as \u2018a standardized contract, which, imposed and drafted by the party of superior bargaining strength, relegates to the subscribing party only the opportunity to adhere to the contract or reject it.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Izzi </em>v. <em>Mesquite Country Club </em>(1986) 186 Cal.App.3d 1309, 1317 [231 Cal.Rptr. 315].)  The contention fails because, even if it is adhesive in nature, \u201cthe contract would remain fully enforceable unless (1) all or part of the contract fell outside the reasonable expectations of the weaker party or (2) it was unduly oppressive or unconscionable under applicable principles of equity.\u201d <em>{Ibid.) </em>Because the Legislature has determined that buyers and sellers of real estate should rely on professionals other than real estate brokers for tax advice, any expectation on the part of plaintiff that defendant would provide such information or \u201cissue-spot\u201d tax problems was not reasonable. Moreover, none of the contractual terms is either \u201cunduly oppressive\u201d or \u201cunconscionable.\u201d <em>{Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">Since defendant\u2019s showing in support of her motion for summary judgment established facts which negated plaintiff\u2019s claims of duty, the final step of our analysis is to determine whether plaintiff\u2019s opposition to defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment demonstrated the existence of a triable, material issue of fact. <em>(AARTS Productions, supra, </em>179 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1064-1065.) It does not. Plaintiffs opposition relied on excerpts from defendant\u2019s deposition which suggest defendant was knowledgeable about the requirements for section 1031 exchanges. While such knowledge may establish an ability to structure the transaction to minimize tax consequences or to warn plaintiff, it does not establish a duty to do so.

Summary judgment for the agent was affirmed because the agent had no duty, contractual or otherwise, to procure the additional coverage or advise the insureds of its availability. Plaintiff claims <em>Ahem </em>is \u201ccompletely different from the instant case\u201d because the insureds \u201ccould have purchased greater insurance coverage than that actually sold.\u201d The asserted distinction has no merit. Plaintiff could have consulted an attorney or an accountant, not \u201cto look for properties to purchase in relation to an anticipated tax-free exchange,\u201d but to ensure that the exchange of properties he had located satisfies the legal requirements for section 1031 exchanges.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b665-8\"> Plaintiff contends <em>Santos </em>does not aid defendant based on an interpretation of the case by commentators. Miller and Starr suggest the <em>Santos </em>court <em>\u201cinfers </em>[sic] that [the broker] had a duty to disclose the tax problems if they knew [of the plaintiffs\u2019 tax situation], but the broker\u2019s duty in that regard was satisfied by urging the sellers to seek counsel from their attorney and accountant.\u201d (2 Miller &amp; Starr, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>\u00a7 3:18, p.

However, <em>Santos </em>did not analyze whether there exists a duty to disclose tax consequences if the broker is aware of the seller\u2019s tax situation, and the court did not consider whether such a duty could be modified or negated by language in the agreements between the broker and the seller. \u201c[C]ases are not authority for propositions not discussed or presented.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hill </em>(1974) 12 Cal.3d 731, 766, fn. 34 [117 Cal.Rptr. 393, 528 P.2d 1], overruled on other grounds in <em>People </em>v. <em>DeVaughn </em>(1977) 18 Cal.3d 889, 896, fn. 5 [135 Cal.Rptr. 786, 558 P.2d 872].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b667-8\"> Plaintiff asks us to augment the record to include plaintiffs and defendant\u2019s depositions in their entirety because the latter \u201cleaves the reader with a clear impression that Defendant, herself, recognized a duty in 1031 exchanges.\u201d Because such recognition would not be relevant to establish any duty on the part of defendant, plaintiff\u2019s request for augmentation is denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b667-9\"> See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 745.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
