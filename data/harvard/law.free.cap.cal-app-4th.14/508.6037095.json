J.</author>\n<p id=\"Axh\">The California Department of Corrections and the director of the department, James Rowland (hereinafter collectively the Department), appeal a trial court injunction that limits the Department\u2019s ability to conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>random searches of prison visitors\u2019 vehicles on prison property. The Department asserts the injunctive conditions effectively prevent it from conducting the vehicle searches, and maintains the injunction is contrary to settled authority holding that prison visitors consent to searches of their vehicles while on prison property. The Department further complains the injunction was premised on stale evidence that did not reflect the practices in effect at the time of trial, and argues the searches ought to be upheld as proper administrative searches. In their cross-appeal respondents assert the searches are unlawful and must be terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">Statement of The Case</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">On February 26, 1986, respondents filed a verified complaint for injunctive and declaratory relief challenging the Department\u2019s program of searching prison visitors\u2019 vehicles for narcotics and other contraband. They sought a preliminary injunction, which the Department opposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">The complaint alleged five causes of action, and asserted violations of visitors\u2019 rights under the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution, article I, section 13 of the California Constitution, Penal Code sections 2600 and 2601 and administrative regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">Following a hearing on respondents\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction the court concluded <em>Mathis </em>v. <em>Appellate Department </em>(1972) 28 Cal.App.3d 1038 [105 Cal.Rptr. 126] required it find the searches were conducted pursuant to the visitors\u2019 consent. However, the court held the Department was required to permit visitors who refused the search to leave prison premises without returning that day. The court thus filed an order that granted in part and denied in part respondents\u2019 requested preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-8\">On May 3, 1988, the Department filed a notice of motion for summary judgment, which was opposed by respondents. After a hearing the court denied the motion on June 30, 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-9\">After a one-month trial, the superior court entered a judgment recognizing the Department\u2019s legitimate interest in searching visitors\u2019 vehicles to stem the flow of drugs and other contraband into the prisons; however, it noted its concern about apparent abuses in the program. Accordingly, the court imposed a number of restrictions designed to cure the problems it discerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-10\">\n<em>The Court\u2019s Decision</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b458-11\">In determining whether the searches qualified as valid administrative searches the court analyzed whether they met the requirements of <em>McMorris </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>v. <em>Alioto </em>(9th Cir. 1978) 567 F.2d 897, 899 [53 A.L.R. Fed. 881].  Under <em>McMorris, </em>a legit\u00edmate administrative search (1) must be clearly necessary to a vital governmental interest; (2) must be limited, and no more intrusive than necessary to accomplish the governmental interest; (3) must be reasonably effective in accomplishing its purpose; and (4) must be conducted for a purpose other than the gathering of evidence for criminal purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">The court concluded the first and third requirements had been met. However, with respect to the second criterion, the court observed that while some institutions had \u201cmaintained a policy of care and consideration toward the visitors,\u201d the treatment of other visitors \u201chas bordered on the abhorrent.\u201d Finally, the court concluded the fourth <em>McMorris </em>condition had been met in most instances, but \u201cgrossly abused\u201d in others. In sum, the court determined that although the evidence showed the existing search policies and practices were flawed, it concluded that if the searches were conducted in accordance with the court\u2019s injunctive conditions they would qualify as proper administrative searches under <em>McMorris. </em>Accordingly, the court imposed the following conditions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-6\">1. All persons eligible to visit inmates must be mailed written notice (in both English and Spanish) of the dog search policy, the reasons for the policy, and the consequences of finding contraband in the vehicle or on the person of a prison visitor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-7\">2. Immediately prior to a proposed search the driver of each vehicle must be informed orally and in writing (again, in both English and Spanish) of what the search will entail, the reasons for it, and the consequences of finding contraband. The notice must advise the driver that he or she has the option of leaving and returning without the car without losing visiting privileges for that day. Searches may be conducted only after written consent for the search is first obtained from the driver.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-8\">3. If the driver decides to leave, passengers may stay and cannot be denied their visit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-9\">4. Local police officers may not be involved in the search process, and may not be present at the search unless there is some valid reason for their presence. Violations of the Vehicle Code may not be reported to any law enforcement agency.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-10\">5. No vehicle may be delayed more than 10 minutes prior to the search.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-11\">6. The search itself may last no longer than 10 minutes. If the drug-detecting dog indicates the presence of drugs the search may be extended by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>five minutes. If contraband is found during the search and is packaged in a manner suggesting it was intended to be smuggled into the prison, additional time for further searches, including unclothed body searches, may be taken.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-4\">7. Dogs must be kept at least 20 feet from visitors at all times.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-5\">8. There may be no reading of books, letters or other documents in possession of visitors that are not reasonably suspected of being contraband.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-6\">9. No visitor may be strip-searched solely on the basis of a positive dog alert unless drugs are found in the vehicle. In the event of a strip search the visitor must be notified orally and in writing of the reason for the search.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-7\">10. If contraband is found the visit may not be denied unless the contraband was packaged in a manner suggesting it was intended to be smuggled into the prison.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-8\">11. No Department employee may damage or soil the visitors\u2019 possessions. If any possessions are removed from any portion of the vehicle they must be returned to the same location at the end of the search.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-9\">12. The Department must adopt regulations encompassing the conditions and must distribute them to all institutions prior to any future search.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-10\">13. The court retained jurisdiction to enforce and supervise the implementation of these conditions and, if necessary, to appoint a monitor to act on behalf of the court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b460-11\">Statement of the Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b460-12\">Prison officials testified that drugs are the central problem confronting California prisons. They described how drugs contribute to prison violence because various gangs fight over control of the drug trade in a particular area. Moreover, an inmate with a drug debt he cannot pay may be attacked or killed. Inmates and their families are sometimes forced to participate in drug smuggling under threat of physical harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-13\">Because existing search procedures were inadequate to detect drugs, prison officials decided to employ drug-detecting dogs to search visitors\u2019 vehicles. In December 1984 a dog-assisted search was conducted at the Correctional Training Facility at Soledad using dogs provided by the United States Customs Office. Every car was searched and a \u201cconsiderable amount\u201d of narcotics discovered. Due to the success of its experiment, the Department purchased two dogs that were first employed at Soledad in August <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>1985. The dogs were not only used to inspect vehicles, but to search work and recreation areas and living units within the prison. .</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">David Reaver, president of a private company that trains dogs used by the Department, testified that the animals are trained to detect marijuana, heroin, cocaine and their derivatives. According to Reaver, a dog\u2019s olfactory ability is \u201cat least a million times better\u201d than that of a human. Reaver explained that his dogs are trained to \u201cpinpoint\u201d the precise spot where drugs are detected and should only require one and one-half to two minutes to complete a car search. Trained dogs are capable of detecting the odor of drugs on a car seat even after the drugs are removed, and can detect the odor of drugs on a seat even if the drugs were hidden in a body cavity of the person who had previously been sitting there.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">The prison searches at issue follow a similar format. At the entrance to each prison a sign is posted warning that possession of weapons, alcohol or drugs on prison property is a felony. On the day of a search a prison staff member advises incoming cars that a random vehicle search is being conducted using dogs trained to detect narcotics. Visitors are told they may decline the search and leave the grounds, but that they will lose the chance to visit that day. As vehicles approach the prison, randomly selected cars are directed to the search area. All occupants are obliged to leave the car and directed to a table on which they must place their personal belongings in a basket for inspection. A staff member obtains identifying information from the driver and records the date, time and results of the search.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">Once the occupants of the car exit the vehicle the dog search begins, and normally takes only a few minutes. At some prisons, the search ends if the dog does not find anything; at other prisons correctional officers conduct a manual search regardless of the results of the dog\u2019s search. If the dog alerts to the presence of narcotics, but none are discovered, the visitor may be asked to submit to an unclothed body search. If the visitor does not consent to such a search he or she is denied a visit for that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">If drugs are discovered on a visitor or in a car, the visitor is generally arrested or referred to local law enforcement. If weapons are discovered the visitor may be arrested or cited, and may be denied a visit for that day. When the search reveals alcohol the visitor may be arrested or cited, or may simply have the alcohol confiscated and then be allowed to visit.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-9\">Numerous prison visitors testified about their experiences with the vehicle search program. Karen Morrison-Stewart testified that on March 30, 1985, she and her nine-year-old son went to San Quentin prison to visit her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>husband. As she approached the prison she was directed into an overflow parking lot. Although she repeatedly asked what was happening, none of the officers offered an explanation and none sought her consent to be searched.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">Ms. Morrison-Stewart and her son were told to assume a searching stance and exposed to a leashed dog. Despite the correctional officer\u2019s attempts to restrain the dogs, a dog approached her and touched its nose to her clothes. Ms. Morrison-Stewart and her son were left standing in the cold damp weather for approximately 10 minutes while their sweaters, jackets and shoes were thoroughly searched by prison personnel. An officer searched her purse and examined personal items such as credit cards, photographs and makeup. During the search the officers broke a speaker cover, left the contents of a bag of trash lying on the floor of the car, and ripped open sealed sterilized items in a first aid kit. No contraband was discovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">Ms. Morrison-Stewart testified that after the search her son was too frightened to visit his stepfather again. As a result, Ms. Morrison-Stewart could only visit once a week, rather than twice, because she could not arrange for someone to watch her son twice a week.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">Kerry Guardiola testified that on December 19, 1987, she drove to Soledad prison to visit a friend. She was directed to a carport area where guards wearing a \u201ccombat type uniform\u201d were waiting. She was not asked for permission to search, and was not told she could refuse to be searched. A leashed dog was brought within a foot of her and sniffed at her body. The officers began searching her car and had a dog search the car. The officers removed bags of Christmas presents and opened sealed toys Ms. Guardiola had purchased for her children.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">Susan Ricker went to visit her boyfriend at Chino East on January 19, 1988. As she approached the prison she was directed to pull off the road. A correctional officer told her she had consented to a search and that they were going to conduct a search that day.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The officers did not seek permission to search, did not explain the need for the search and did not inform Ms. Ricker that she could refuse the search and leave the prison grounds. Ms. Ricker testified she was in the process of moving and had dresser drawers full of clean clothes which the officers inspected and dropped onto the ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">Other visitors testified regarding the searches they experienced. In one instance the discovery of an unopened bottle of champagne prompted an arrest, a strip search and a two-week denial of visiting privileges while the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>alcohol possession charge was processed. During another search, the dogs became excited after sniffing a visitor\u2019s purse. Although the visitor accounted for the dogs\u2019 interest by explaining that her purse was stored near meat in a butcher shop, she was subjected to a strip search and body cavity inspection. No contraband was discovered. Some witnesses testified they felt frightened, violated and invaded by the search process and complained the guards were rude and treated them disrespectfully. Other witnesses acknowledged the officers were polite and \u201cpleasant\u201d during the search.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">Raymond Procunier, who worked for over 40 years in the field of corrections, and had been director of the Department, testified for respondents. He believed the dog search operation was flawed in many respects, complaining the procedure is not effective enough in curtailing smuggling to justify \u201crunning over the rights\u201d of prison visitors. He believed the Department exaggerated the problem of contraband in prison parking lots. In his view, if prisoners regularly received contraband in the parking lots the Department should simply deny inmates access to those areas. Procunier testified contraband could more effectively be intercepted, without intrusion to visitors, through better postvisit searches of inmates and more extensive use of dogs inside prisons. According to Procunier, the visitor searches violate both Department regulations and the regulations of San Quentin, each of which require some reasonable suspicion before a visitor may be searched. He also testified that the gross amount of contraband intercepted is not an effective measure of the program\u2019s success, since most of the contraband seized from visitors was not designed to be smuggled into prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">The Department first contends the court erred in denying its motion for summary judgment because, by entering prison property, prison visitors consent to the search of their person, property and vehicles. In <em>Mathis </em>v. <em>Appellate Department, supra, </em>28 Cal.App.3d 1038, 1040, the court considered whether \u201cthe state or its agencies may validly establish as a condition to entry into a parking lot which is part of a custodial facility that the vehicle be subject to search.\u201d The court concluded that when individuals enter prison property after passing a sign that notifies visitors that entering vehicles are subject to search, they \u201cmay reasonably be deemed to have consented to search . . . .\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b463-9\">The Department emphasizes that all state prisons have posted at their entrance a sign warning visitors they are entering prison property; that drugs, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>weapons and other contraband is prohibited; and that their entry onto prison property is deemed consent to search their person, property and vehicles. The Department claims that, in light of this warning, the court was required under <em>Mathis </em>to hold the Department\u2019s searches were consensual, and thus grant its motion for summary judgment. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">First, as a factual matter, <em>Mathis </em>does not completely legitimate the kind of searches challenged in this case. While <em>Mathis </em>determined that consent could be presumed after visitors pass a sign warning of a potential search, the opinion does not discuss the nature of the searches that can legitimately be conducted pursuant to such implied consent. There is nothing in <em>Mathis </em>to suggest that vehicle searches employing intimidating narcotic-detecting dogs and the possibility of strip searches could be premised on the implied consent found in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">The Department alternatively maintains the dog searches were proper administrative searches.  An administrative or regulatory search is one \u201cconducted as part of a general regulatory scheme in furtherance of an administrative purpose, rather than as part of a criminal investigation to secure evidence of crime.\u201d <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Davis </em>(9th Cir. 1973) 482 F.2d 893, 908.)  Such searches are permissible under the Fourth Amendment \u201cthough not supported by a showing of probable cause directed to a particular place or person to be searched.\u201d <em>(Ibid.; </em>see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Biswell </em>(1972) 406 U.S. 311 [32 L.Ed.2d 87, 92 S.Ct. 1593] [upholding search of firearms dealer\u2019s storeroom under Gun Control Act of 1968]; <em>Wyman </em>v. <em>James </em>(1971) 400 U.S. 309 [27 L.Ed.2d 408, 91 S.Ct. 381] [receipt of welfare benefits can be conditioned on recipient\u2019s consent to periodic home visits by caseworker]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Hyde </em>(1974) 12 Cal.3d 158 [115 Cal.Rptr. 358, 524 P.2d 830] [upholding airport screening procedures].) Administrative searches may be conducted without probable cause in part because they usually involve \u201cless of an intrusion on personal privacy and dignity than that which generally occurs in the course of [a] criminal investigation.\u201d (3 LaFave, Search and Seizure (2d ed. 1987) \u00a7 10.1(b), p. 607.) Furthermore, administrative or regulatory searches are often conducted under circumstances where the burden of obtaining a warrant would frustrate the governmental purpose behind the search. <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 10.1(c), at p. 609.)</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">Witnesses for both sides agreed that the presence of contraband (particularly narcotics) in California\u2019s prisons is a grave and urgent problem. Daniel McCarthy, former director of the Department and a named defendant, testified that the presence of narcotics in prisons is \u201cthe major problem\u201d confronting correctional officers and administrators. He stated that narcotics is the main cause of violence in California\u2019s prisons. The problem also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>affects communities outside prison, he explained, since friends and relatives of inmates may be coerced into illegally acquiring drugs if the inmate is threatened with violence or death within prison if his visitors fail to smuggle drugs to him. Mr. McCarthy testified that, nationwide, correctional administrators agreed that visitors were the main source of contraband within prisons. According to him, conventional visitor screening techniques cannot discover contraband secreted in undergarments or body cavities, as is often the case. Respondents\u2019 witness, Raymond Procunier, also a former director of the Department, acknowledged that the presence in prisons of drugs and weapons presents a \u201cserious threat\u201d to prison security. He stated that some inmates may get violent when on drugs, and others may be hurt or killed if they fail to pay a drug debt. Mr. Procunier described how visitors can smuggle drugs into even maximum security prisons and then pass the contraband on to prisoners.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">In assessing the reasonableness of an administrative search we must \u201c \u2018balanc[e] the need to search against the invasion the search entails.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hyde, supra, </em>12 Cal.3d at p. 166, quoting <em>Camara </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1967) 387 U.S. 523, 536-537 [18 L.Ed.2d 930, 940, 87 S.Ct. 1727].)  The need to search was established in this case by the undisputed testimony concerning the severity of the drug problem and evidence that traditional search or inspection methods could not adequately curtail the importation of drugs into the prisons. Against this need we balance the inconvenience to visitors\u2014the majority wholly innocent of any wrongdoing\u2014who wish to visit friends or relatives in prison. While dog searches of vehicles may be intrusive, we cannot ignore the fact that visitors knowingly and voluntarily enter an area necessarily subject to a level of security unmatched in any other part of our society. (4 LaFave, Search and Seizure (2d ed. 1987) \u00a7 10.7(b), p. 43 [proceeding in the face of known possible search bears on reasonableness].) While we doubt that the type of invasive searches involved here would be justified in many other situations in which administrative searches have been upheld, the level of drugs and violence in our prisons convinces us that these visitor searches, though in some ways unprecedented, may be conducted as proper administrative searches. Moreover, as intrusive as they are, random dog searches of vehicles do not approach the intrusiveness of the strip searching of all prison visitors condemned in <em>Blackburn </em>v. <em>Snow </em>(1st Cir. 1985) 771 F.2d 556.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">As the trial court apparently recognized, however, characterizing the searches as \u201cadministrative\u201d does not end the inquiry. Even if the searches were authorized as regulatory searches, the court was authorized, and indeed obligated, to analyze the manner in which the searches were conducted to insure constitutional safeguards were being met.  \u201cTo pass constitutional muster, an administrative search must meet the Fourth Amendment\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>standard of reasonableness. ...[][] To meet the test of reasonableness, an administrative screening search must be as limited in its intrusiveness as is consistent with satisfaction of the administrative need that justifies it.\u201d <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Davis, supra, </em>482 F.2d 893, 910, fn. omitted; <em>Ingersoll </em>v. <em>Palmer </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 1321, 1329 [241 Cal.Rptr. 42, 743 P.2d 1299] [\u201cThe touchstone for all issues under the Fourth Amendment and article I, section 13 of the California Constitution is reasonableness.\u201d]) Thus, for example, although the court in <em>Davis </em>determined that airplane passengers are deemed to have consented to the customary preboarding search,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> it nonetheless recognized the need under the Fourth Amendment to examine the reasonableness of the search procedure. (482 F.2d at pp. 908-912.) Similarly, in <em>McMorris </em>v. <em>Alioto, supra, </em>567 F.2d 897, 901, the court determined that courthouse visitors impliedly consent to search, yet concluded the search nonetheless must be limited and reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">In this case the trial court refused to grant summary judgment because it concluded there were at least three substantial contested issues: (1) whether the drug smuggling by visitors to inmates constitutes an issue of \u201cgrave governmental concern\u201d; (2) whether the searches are an effective method of addressing this concern; and (3) whether the searches are conducted in a way to minimize interference with individual liberties.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Because these issues were all crucial to a determination of whether the challenged searches were legitimate regulatory searches, the motion for summary judgment was properly denied.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">The Department moved <em>in limine </em>to limit the evidence to events that occurred no more than two years prior to trial. The court denied this motion.  The Department now contends the court erred in issuing an injunction based on evidence of searches conducted long before trial and asserts an injunction must be founded on evidence of abuses existing at the time of trial. <em>(Rosicrucian Fellowship </em>v. <em>Rosicrucian Etc. Ch. </em>(1952) 39 Cal.2d 121, 135 [245 P.2d 481].)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In particular, the Department complains the injunction was improperly premised on testimony concerning abuses involved in the early searches during 1985 and 1986 that, it asserts, have been largely corrected.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">While injunctive relief may not be proper when all past abuses have been remedied, courts have held that such relief may be granted where past practices have been stopped in anticipation of suit, and may be resumed if there is no injunction to prevent it. For example, in <em>Fisher </em>v. <em>Koehler </em>(S.D.N.Y. 1988) 692 F.Supp. 1519, the plaintiffs established Eighth Amendment violations at a New York correctional facility. Pointing to recent reforms, the defendants argued that injunctive relief was unnecessary. The court rejected this claim, explaining that \u201c \u2018[i]t is the duty of the courts to beware of efforts to defeat injunctive relief by protestations of repentance and reform, especially when abandonment seems timed to anticipate suit, and there is a probability of resumption [of the abuses].\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 1565, citations omitted.) Similarly, in <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Phosphate Export Assn. </em>(1968) 393 U.S. 199 [21 L.Ed.2d 344, 89 S.Ct. 361] the appellee asserted injunctive relief was unwarranted because the defendant association (which had allegedly committed antitrust violations) had been dissolved. The court noted that in order to avoid the injunction the burden was on <em>the defendant </em>to show the problem \u201ccould not reasonably be expected to recur.\u201d (393 U.S at p. 203 [21 L.Ed.2d at p. 349].)</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">While in this case there was evidence suggesting some of the most serious abuses had ended, substantial evidence proved some searches still exceeded constitutional limits. The court thus reasonably could have concluded injunctive relief was necessary to prevent the Department from continuing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>its current unconstitutional practices, or possibly resuming past abusive conduct.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">Furthermore, although the court permitted the presentation of evidence concerning the earlier dog searches, there was also substantial evidence concerning searches conducted during the two years prior to trial (and thus within the time frame the Department sought). Seven visitors testified about recent searches at five different facilities and correctional officers testified regarding the practices of the Department during that time. In addition, extensive documentary evidence detailed the search procedures followed at the various institutions. This evidence proved that while some of the early problems may have been corrected, some recent searches were still plagued by abuses, including overintrusiveness,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> lengthy delays,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> lack of consent,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> unreasonable denial of visitation and misuse of dogs.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Thus, even disregarding the older evidence challenged by the Department, there was ample evidence from recent searches that provided a sufficient basis for the court\u2019s decision to impose the search conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">The Department contends that eight of the thirteen injunctive conditions imposed by the court unduly limit its ability to conduct proper administrative searches.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We agree with some of these contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>A. <em>Notice Requirements</em></p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">The Department first maintains the court erred in requiring it to provide contemporaneous oral and written notice of the vehicle searches, and in ordering it to obtain written consent prior to the search. The Department also objects to the requirement that it advise visitors of the right to refuse the search without forfeiting that day\u2019s visit so long as they leave and return without their car.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">The Department\u2019s objection to these conditions is baffling since in its trial brief it claimed visitors already were given the very notice it now seems unwilling to provide: the brief asserted that \u201cvisitors are informed that they have the right to refuse to be searched and to leave if they do not want to be searched.\u201d The trial court found otherwise, and concluded, \u201cthe evidence showed that most visitors were never told that they could leave, and others were denied the right to leave even if they wanted to.\u201d Further, there was evidence visitors were not advised of the purpose of the seaches and not informed of their right to refuse the search even after the court issued a preliminary injunction requiring that such advice be given.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">The notice requirements imposed by the court were a proper device that increased the probability of acquiring informed and voluntary consent and enhanced the deterrent effect of the searches.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">Unquestionably, providing visitors adequate notice of the search procedure and informing them of their right to refuse the search is essential to securing meaningful consent.  As the Department recognizes, the voluntariness of a person\u2019s consent depends on the \u201ctotality of all the circumstances\u201d surrounding the grant of consent. <em>(Schneckloth </em>v. <em>Bustamonte </em>(1973) 412 U.S. 218, 227 [36 L.Ed.2d 854, 863, 93 S.Ct. 2041].)  Some searches were conducted in a coercive atmosphere, with guards wearing \u201ccombat gear\u201d and restraining chained dogs. These conditions, combined with visitors\u2019 desire to see their friends and relatives, provided strong incentive for visitors to sign consent forms. When consent is granted without knowledge that it may be withheld, however, it raises serious doubts whether it is truly voluntary, particularly where, as here, the surrounding circumstances are intimidating.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Davis, supra, </em>482 F.2d at p. 914 [knowledge of the right to refuse consent is to be taken into account in assessing voluntariness of consent].) To ensure that prison visitors receive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>information adequate to support the grant of voluntary consent the court simply required the Department to do what it claimed it had been doing all along, i.e., advise visitors of the nature of the search and of their right to refuse the search.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">The notice requirements presumably also advanced the key objective of the search (stopping the flow of contraband into prisons), since it is likely that after receiving notice visitors carrying contraband would leave, rather than risk search. (See <em>Ingersoll </em>v. <em>Palmer, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d at p. 1336 [advance publicity of the sobriety checkpoint increases the deterrent effect of the roadblock].) The court was well within its discretion in imposing these notice requirements, which complement the prior written notice required to be mailed by the Department to all known persons eligible to visit inmates.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">B. <em>Time Limits</em></p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\"> The Department next contends the court improperly ordered that visitors may not be kept waiting more than 10 minutes, and that searches may not last more than 10 minutes (or 15 minutes if a dog alerts to the scent of narcotics). It complains the limits are \u201cunworkable\u201d and unnecessary for lawful visitor searches.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">In <em>Ingersoll </em>v. <em>Palmer, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d 1321, motorists challenged sobriety checkpoints that resulted in an average delay of 28 seconds (or 6.13 minutes if sobriety tests were administered).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> (43 Cal.3d at p. 1327.) Our Supreme Court observed that the average time each motorist was detained was \u201ccritical\u201d to minimizing the intrusiveness of the stop and justifying it as a proper administrative detention. (43 Cal.3d at p. 1346.) In this case the trial court properly recognized the importance of limiting the duration of both the wait and the searches and thus imposed time limits designed to prevent undue delays for the visitors while allowing sufficient time for complete searches.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">We agree that time limits were needed to avoid the unacceptably long delays and searches proven by the evidence. As a general proposition it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>seems to us entirely reasonable to require that a visitor not be kept waiting for search to commence more than 10 minutes from the time his or her vehicle is randomly selected to be searched. Similarly, we think it reasonable for dog searches ordinarily to be limited to ten minutes, given the expert testimony that a dog only requires one and one-half to two minutes to search a car. (See also <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Taylor </em>(9th Cir. 1991) 934 F.2d 218, 220 [dog search of vehicle for drugs took \u201conly a minute\"].) At the same time, we recognize that unusual factors beyond the control of the Department may in particular instances render it impossible to commence or complete a dog search within the period prescribed by the court. A tired or otherwise distressed dog may refuse to cooperate with his handlers. Additional time may also be required in connection with the search of an unusual vehicle, such as a van or a motor home. In unusual situations such as these, where the exigency is not created by the Department, the search may exceed 10 minutes. In no instance, however, may the wait for search to commence or the search itself exceed 30 minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">The Department also claims it should not be limited to only an additional five minutes for the search if a dog alerts to the scent of narcotics. It argues that because a dog alert to the presence of drugs provides probable cause to believe contraband is in the car it should thereafter be permitted to search without a time limit. This point is well taken: courts have indeed recognized that an alert by a narcotic-detecting dog provides probable cause for a search. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Salih </em>(1985) 173 Cal.App.3d 1009 [219 Cal.Rptr. 603], customs officials opened a parcel from Thailand after a drug-sniffing dog reacted to the presence of narcotics. The court concluded that, \u201c[o]nce alerted by the reactions of the dog, the customs officials had reasonable cause to suspect the international mail parcel might contain contraband and therefore they were authorized to open it.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 1015.) Similarly, in <em>People </em>v. <em>Matthews </em>(1980) 112 Cal.App.3d 11 [169 Cal.Rptr. 263] the court upheld an inspector\u2019s search of a car, based on a trained dog\u2019s alert indicating the car contained narcotics. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 21.)</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">In this case, once a dog alerts to the presence of narcotics the search is no longer an administrative search, confined by the limits of that doctrine, but a probable cause search limited only by \u201cgeneral principles of detention and arrest.\u201d <em>(Ingersoll, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d at p. 1346 [once officer observes signs of driver intoxication further investigation is based on probable cause].) Because the Fourth Amendment imposes no fixed time limits on a search founded on probable cause, the court erred in limiting the time permitted for a search following a dog\u2019s alert to the scent of contraband. As such, that injunctive condition must be stricken.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">The Department also complains the court erred in only allowing the search to be extended beyond the time limits noted if contraband is found <em>and </em>it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>packaged in a manner suggesting it was intended to be smuggled into prison. Respondents maintain this condition was justified because an administrative search must be \u201c \u2018 \u201cstrictly tied to and justified by\u201d the circumstances which rendered its initiation permissible.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hyde, supra, </em>12 Cal.3d at p. 168.) According to respondents, the Department may only conduct searches that may discover contraband intended to be smuggled into the prison, since the dog search program assertedly was implemented for that limited purpose. Where contraband is discovered that is not susceptible to being smuggled, because of its size, weight or composition, respondents maintain the administrative objective of the search has been fulfilled, and the search may not be extended.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">Respondents\u2019 position is premised on an excessively narrow interpretation of the administrative search doctrine.  We are not the first court to recognize that evidence of criminal activity unrelated to the purpose of the search may be disclosed by legitimate, limited administrative searches. The California Supreme Court has expressly concluded, however, that the discovery of such evidence \u201cdoes not alter the fundamentally administrative character\u201d of the search. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hyde, supra, </em>12 Cal.3d at p. 166; <em>Ingersoll </em>v. <em>Palmer, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d at pp. 1331-1332 [airport screening procedure and sobriety checkpoint stops are administrative searches despite likely discovery of unrelated criminal activity].) Although the dog searches were conceived to discover contraband intended to be or least capable of being smuggled into prisons, they may unearth evidence of other criminal activity; under <em>Hyde </em>and <em>Ingersoll, </em>Department officials do not exceed the proper limits of an administrative search if they undertake further investigation based on the discovery of such evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">Moreover, because it is a crime to bring drugs onto prison property, regardless of how they are packaged (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 4573-4573.6), peace officers cannot be limited when conducting a search incident to a valid detention or arrest based on such a violation. The discovery of such evidence provides probable cause to continue the search, limited only by relevant constitutional principles. Accordingly, the court\u2019s limit on such searches cannot stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">C. <em>Distance Between Dogs and Visitors</em></p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">Paragraph 8 of the injunction requires that drug-detecting dogs be kept at least 20 feet from visitors at all times.  The Department contends this condition is \u201cimpracticable\u201d and provides \u201cfertile ground for future contempt proceedings based on observations of violations of the limit by visitors interested in the drug-detecting dogs\u2019 training and work.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>Former director McCarthy testified he instituted a policy of keeping the dogs 20 feet away from visitors, but that this was done to prevent visitors from getting too close to the dogs, and not the reverse. Based on this testimony the Department asserts the policy was implemented to foster its administrative needs, and cannot be interpreted as evidence the Department recognized the need to keep the dogs a safe distance from visitors. Indeed, the Department refuses even to acknowledge the fear its drug-detecting animals may cause visitors and glosses over the testimony of numerous witnesses who expressed the great fear they and, in some cases, their children, experienced during the dog searches.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">The Department seems to us unduly insensitive to the rights of visitors, which can be protected with little inconvenience to prison guards and without compromising the effectiveness of the search. \u201cNeither administrative inconvenience nor lack of resources can provide justification for deprivation of constitutional rights.\u201d <em>(In re Grimes </em>(1989) 208 Cal.App.3d 1175, 1183 [256 Cal.Rptr. 690].) In this case the court simply ordered the Department to resume compliance with a condition previously imposed by a former director. The need for this condition was evident and the court acted properly by imposing it.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">D. <em>Unclothed Body Searches</em></p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">The Department objects to both paragraph 9 of the injunction, which prohibits requests for strip searches based solely on a positive dog alert, and the portion of paragraph 6 that permits strip search requests only if any contraband found is packaged in a manner demonstrating an intent to smuggle. Under the court\u2019s order, an unclothed body search may be conducted only \u201cif drugs or narcotics are found in the vehicle and the contraband is packaged and located in a manner that would cause a reasonable person to believe that it was intended to be smuggled into the prison by that visitor.\u201d The Department argues this condition (1) unnecessarily limits the proper use of strip searches even when probable cause (provided by the dog alert) is present; and (2) imposes an \u201cill-defined limitation\u201d on the searches based on the contraband\u2019s packaging and location.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-8\">1. <em>Paragraph 9</em></p>\n<p id=\"b473-9\">The Department preliminarily contends that, even if a manual search of the vehicle does not unearth any drugs, it should be permitted to request a strip search based on a positive dog alert and that a visitor who refuses such a request may be denied visiting rights and compelled to leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-10\">In <em>Hunter </em>v. <em>Auger </em>(8th Cir. 1982) 672 F.2d 668, 674 [69 A.L.R. Fed. 841] the court considered the constitutionality of unclothed searches of prison <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>visitors based on uncorroborated anonymous tips that a visitor would be carrying contraband. The court concluded \u201cthe Constitution mandates that a reasonable suspicion standard govern strip searches of visitors to penal institutions.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 674.)<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> \u201cTo justify a strip search of a particular visitor under the reasonable suspicion standard, prison officials must point to specific objective facts and rational inferences that they are entitled to draw from those facts in light of their experience.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The Department argues a positive dog alert provides the \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d necessary to at least justify a strip search <em>request.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">In support of its argument, the Department cites <em>United States </em>v. <em>Spetz </em>(9th Cir. 1983) 721 F.2d 1457, 1464, where the court concluded that a dog alert may provide sufficient probable cause for a search warrant. Relying on <em>Spetz, </em>the Department asserts that if a dog alert can provide the probable cause needed for a warrant, it necessarily must be sufficient to support a request to conduct an unclothed body search. In response, respondents rely on <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Renfrow </em>(N.D.Ind. 1979) 475 F.Supp. 1012, affd. 631 F.2d 91 (7th Cir. 1980), where the court concluded school officials had violated a student\u2019s constitutional rights by subjecting her to a strip search based only on a dog\u2019s alert.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">The Department\u2019s argument is persuasive. If a positive dog alert provides sufficient probable cause to support a warrant, then it logically follows that such an alert provides a constitutionally reasonable basis for requesting an unclothed body search which, as we have noted, may be conducted based on the less demanding \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\"><em>Doe </em>v. <em>Renfrow, supra, </em>which involved egregious constitutional violations unmatched in this case, is limited in its application. In <em>Renfrow, </em>school officials conducted a school-wide search using drug-detecting dogs. Students were made to sit with their hands on their desks while dogs sniffed each child. After a dog seemingly alerted to drugs on a 13-year-old girl she emptied her pockets; when no drugs were found she was forced to submit to a strip search, which also failed to uncover drugs.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The court declared this search unconstitutional: \u201cThe continued alert by the trained canine alone is insufficient to justify such a search because the animal reacts only to the scent or odor of the marijuana plant, not the substance itself. . . . Therefore, the alert of the dog alone does not provide the necessary reasonable cause to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>believe the student actually <em>possesses </em>the drug.\u201d (475 F.Supp. at p. 1024, italics in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\"><em>Renfrow </em>is distinguishable. First, the children searched were not provided advance notice and an opportunity to refuse. Further, if a child was the focus of a dog alert, he or she was not simply requested to submit to a strip search, but compelled to do so. In comparison, the searches at issue here are conducted on the grounds of a state prison after substantial advance warning. Based on the trial court\u2019s injunction, most visitors will have received advance notification by mail of the possibility of search, further, no search is permitted until the visitor is provided contemporaneous oral and written notice of the search, and told of the right to refiise the search. Finally, if a dog alerts, but no contraband is found in the vehicle, officials only may ask to conduct a strip search; the visitor is free to refiise and leave the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">Not only is <em>Renfrow </em>factually dissimilar, but the opinion explicitly limits its misleadingly unqualified statement that the dog alert \u201cdoes not provide reasonable cause to believe the student actually <em>possesses </em>the drug.\u201d (475 F.Supp. at p. 1024, italics in original.) In fact, the court signalled that its conclusion was motivated by the blatant violation of the students\u2019 rights, and observed, \u201c[tjhis Court can conceive of many situations where the alert of a trained dog alone can provide the necessary reasonable cause for a more complete but private body search.\u201d (475 F.Supp. at p. 1027.) In our opinion, a limited administrative search of prison visitors aimed at restricting the flow of contraband into a prison is among the unusual situations in which a strip search request (which, it must again be emphasized, can be refused) is justified based solely on a dog alert.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">2. <em>Paragraph 6</em></p>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">The Department also complains the court improperly limited unclothed body searches to situations where contraband is discovered <em>and </em>is packaged and located in a manner suggesting it was intended to be smuggled; it asserts that once contraband is found, a strip search may be requested regardless of its location or the form in which it is packaged.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-9\">The difficulty with this condition is that it is not always possible to determine whether contraband is intended to be smuggled. The Department concedes that possession of certain types of contraband that cannot easily be smuggled into a prison\u2014a bottle of wine or six-pack of beer, for example\u2014 does not provide reasonable cause to believe that the possessor intended to smuggle it into the prison. For that reason, the Department acknowledges it would be unreasonable and unduly intrusive to subject a visitor to a strip <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>search simply because he or she was found in possession of a standard size and conventionally packaged alcoholic beverage or a similar item too large or unwieldy to be smuggled into prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">The situation is very different, however, with respect to narcotics, the type of contraband of greatest concern to prison officials. Even though a package of drugs may be so large and unwieldy that it would be unreasonable to believe the possessor intended to smuggle the entire package into prison, a smaller portion could be brought into the institution by secreting it in a body cavity. Thus a strip search may be requested where the contraband discovered during the search, although not packaged in a manner suggesting the entire amount was intended to be smuggled, exists in a form that can be secreted on the person of a prison visitor.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">E. <em>Denial of Visitation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">The Department also challenges paragraph 10 of the judgment, which prohibits the denial of visitation for a visitor found with contraband unless the contraband is \u201cpackaged in a manner that would cause a reasonable person to believe that it was intended to be smuggled into the prison, or unless the contraband is found on the person of the visitor.\u201d  The Department asserts that, as applied to narcotics, this condition constitutes a \u201cgross invasion\u201d of prison officials\u2019 power to safely manage penal institutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">This condition is not only impractical, but improperly limits officials\u2019 right to investigate and arrest for violations of Penal Code sections 4573-4573.6. First, the condition suffers from the same problem as the strip search condition; although a large amount of drugs, pills or other forms of narcotics could not be smuggled into prison, it is reasonable to suspect that the possessor of such items intended to smuggle a smaller portion into the prison. Further, the condition is inconsistent with the duty of a peace officer to arrest a person in possession of contraband on prison premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">F. <em>Injunction to Prevent Mishandling of Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b476-9\">The Department also claims that paragraph 11, which prohibits the mishandling or soiling of any visitor\u2019s property, and which requires the replacement of any inspected items, is improper and unnecessary. The Department maintains that if a visitor has property damaged or soiled during a search he has an adequate legal remedy, for he may file a claim for compensation with the Board of Control. Under these circumstances, the Department asserts, equitable relief is inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>\u201c[T]here is no right to equitable relief or an equitable remedy when there is an <em>adequate remedy at law.\u201d </em>(11 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (9th ed. 1990) Equity, \u00a7 3, p. 681, italics in original); <em>Brownfield </em>v. <em>Daniel Freeman Marina Hospital </em>(1989) 208 Cal.App.3d 405, 410 [256 Cal.Rptr. 240] [there must be an injury that \u201ccannot be compensated by an ordinary damage award\u201d].)  Respondents maintain, however, that equitable relief is proper where damages are difficult or impossible to calculate. They also assert an injunction may issue where necessary to prevent a multiplicity of separate actions. (See 6 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (3d ed. 1985) Provisional Remedies, \u00a7\u00a7 253, 255, pp. 220-221.) The present record does not show, however, either that damages will be difficult to calculate or that, in the absence of an injunction, numerous visitors will commence litigation seeking compensation for property damaged during searches.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">Concededly, the record shows that Department officials executed some searches with, at best, casual and indefensible indifference to visitors\u2019 property. Nevertheless, the record simply does not demonstrate the inadequacy of existing legal remedies. For this reason, paragraph 11 of the injunction cannot stand. We reach this conclusion with the hope and expectation that those conducting the searches will, regardless of any continuing injunctive order, avoid unnecessary damage to visitors\u2019 private property and treat it with the respect it deserves. Furthermore, we must emphasize that our conclusion that equitable relief is now uncalled for, is based only on the inadequacy of the record before us; we do not foreclose the granting of injunctive relief by the trial court in the future upon a sufficient showing that Department officials are unwilling to treat visitors\u2019 property with proper respect in the absence of an injunctive order compelling them to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">G. <em>Retention of Jurisdiction to Appoint Monitor or Master</em></p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">Finally, the Department claims the court erred in retaining jurisdiction to appoint a monitor or master if necessary to supervise implementation of the court\u2019s order.  It claims there is no \u201cexpress authority for the court\u2019s jurisdiction to appoint a monitor.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Because the court has not yet appointed a monitor or master, but has only reserved jurisdiction to do so, we need not address the propriety of actually appointing a monitor or master in this case.  At this point, we need only decide whether a trial court properly may reserve jurisdiction to ensure the parties comply with an injunctive order.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>It is well settled that \u201c[independent of statute, a court which renders an equitable decree may appropriately reserve jurisdiction to take steps to carry it into effect. . . (7 Witkin, Cal. Procedure, (3d ed. 1985) Judgment, \u00a7 81, p. 516.)  The Department offers no authority to the contrary. The injunctive order in this case, \u201c \u2018although purporting on its face to be permanent, is in essence of an executory or continuing nature . . . \u201d <em>(Palo Alto-Menlo Park Yellow Cab Co. </em>v. <em>Santa Clara County Transit Dist. </em>(1976) 65 Cal.App.3d 121, 130 [135 Cal.Rptr. 192].) A court possesses the inherent power to reserve jurisdiction to ensure that its injunctive orders are carried out. The court below properly reserved jurisdiction for that purpose; we leave for another day the question whether appointment of a monitor or master is necessary or proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\"> In their cross-appeal respondents assert the prison dog search program is unlawful because it both exceeds the limits of a proper administrative search and violates Penal Code sections 2600 and 2601, subdivision (d), which guarantee prisoners the right to receive visitors.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">Respondents maintain the dog searches exceed the previously recognized bounds of administrative searches because: (1) such searches are far more intrusive than searches previously sanctioned under the administrative search doctrine; (2) they are overbroad, in that they involve searches of items not intended to be brought into the prison; (3) prison officials are granted wide discretion regarding the specifics of each search; (4) they are surprise searches, while most administrative searches are conducted with advance notice; and (5) they are too often used for general law enforcement purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-9\">While, as earlier observed, the searches in question are undeniably intrusive, we cannot agree that they are unlawful. As already explained, the court\u2019s judgment addressed respondents\u2019 legitimate concerns and imposed substantial limits on the search process that bring it within the parameters of the administrative search doctrine. Many of those conditions were acceded to by the Department. (See <em>ante, </em>fn. 11, p. 526.) This court leaves most of the challenged constraints intact. Thus, for example, the trial court placed reasonable time limits on the length of searches; restricted the breadth of permissible search by prohibiting inspection of personal papers that could not constitute contraband; and reduced the likelihood of surprise searches by requiring advance as well as contemporaneous notice of the dog search <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>program and permitting visitors the option of leaving.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> In order to reduce the likelihood searches would be used for general law enforcement purposes, the court additionally prohibited the involvement of local police or other law enforcement authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">We do not believe the searches are unlawful simply because they exceed the limits of those approved by the courts in different contexts. It is true that the airport search approved in <em>People </em>v. <em>Hyde, supra, </em>12 Cal.3d at page 169, and the sobriety checkpoint program reviewed in <em>Ingersoll </em>v. <em>Palmer, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d 1321 were both shorter and otherwise less intrusive than the searches at issue here. However, with the use of metal detectors, small weapons can be discovered much more easily and more quickly than small quantities of narcotics secreted in a prison visitor\u2019s vehicle, clothes or body. Similarly, the initial stop for sobriety checks in <em>Ingersoll </em>lasted on average only 28 seconds because the screening officer was able in that short time to observe the driver for bloodshot eyes, alcohol on the breath or other obvious signs of impairment. (43 Cal.3d at p. 1327.) It is impossible to make a reasonably accurate assessment of whether drugs are present without conducting a more thorough, and necessarily longer search than those involved in <em>People </em>v. <em>Hyde </em>and <em>Ingersoll </em>v. <em>Palmer.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the searches with which we are here concerned are not taking place in airports or on public streets, but on the premises of a maximum security prison. As the United States Supreme Court has recognized, \u201ccentral to all other corrections goals is the institutional consideration of internal security within the corrections facilities themselves.\u201d <em>(Pell </em>v. <em>Procunier </em>(1974) 417 U.S. 817, 823 [41 L.Ed.2d 495, 502, 94 S.Ct. 2800].) The evidence demonstrated that smuggling drugs and weapons is the central problem confronting prison administrators. Because visitor searches provide an effective (albeit imperfect) means to address this problem we are persuaded that, despite their intrusive nature, they qualify as administrative searches.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">Also in connection with their cross-appeal, respondents argue the searches are invalid because they violate Penal Code section 2600 and subdivision (d) of section 2601. Section 2600 provides that \u201cA person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>sentenced to imprisonment in a state prison may, during any such period of confinement, be deprived of such rights, and only such rights, as are necessary in order to provide for the reasonable security of the institution in which he is confined and for the reasonable protection of the public.\u201d Section 2601, subdivision (d), states that inmates have certain civil rights, including the right \u201c[t]o have personal visits; provided that the department may provide such restrictions as are necessary for the reasonable security of the institution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">The analysis of a claim under section 2600 requires a three-step inquiry: \u201c(1) Are any \u2018rights\u2019 implicated? (2) If they are, does a \u2018reasonable security\u2019 problem exist which might permit a deprivation of rights under the statute? (3) If so, to what extent are deprivations of those rights \u2018necessary\u2019 to satisfy reasonable security interests?\u201d <em>(In re Arias </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 667, 689-690 [230 Cal.Rptr. 505, 725 P.2d 664].)<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">The Department claims we need not go beyond the first question, because only visitors\u2019 rights, not inmates\u2019 rights, are affected by the dog search program. We disagree. Sections 2600 and 2601, subdivision (d) have been used to challenge restrictions that primarily affect visitors, but consequentially diminish inmates\u2019 visitation rights. For example, in <em>In re French </em>(1980) 106 Cal.App.3d 74 [164 Cal.Rptr. 800] the court considered the validity of prison policy providing that once a visitor refused a full body search, all fixture visits were both relegated to noncontact status and conditioned on a full body search. <em>In re Stone </em>(1982) 130 Cal.App.3d 922 [182 Cal.Rptr. 79] also involved the legality of imposing a blanket noncontact restriction on persons who once refused a body search. While the dog searches that are the subject of this case only directly affected visitors, they invariably resulted in shorter visits because tlxe search consumed some of the time the visitors had intended to spend with an inmate. These delays were sometimes lengthy, especially in cases in which a full body search was conducted. Moreover, where contraband was discovered the planned visit was completely denied. Because the practical effect of the searches was to limit and, in some instances, cancel planned visits, it is plain that the dog search program implicates rights protected by sections 2600 and 2601, subdivision (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">Under Arias, we must next determine whether there is a reasonable security problem that might justify such a deprivation of rights. The evidence demonstrates that the smuggling of contraband into California\u2019s prisons is a grave problem reqxxiring unprecedented security procedures; this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>evidence clearly supports the conclusion that prison administrators implemented the search program in an effort to deal with a very real and dangerous security problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">The most difficult question is that posited by the third prong of <em>Arias, </em>that is, whether the deprivations are \u201cnecessary\u201d to satisfy reasonable security interests. <em>(In re Arias, supra, </em>42 Cal.3d at p. 690.)  \u201cIf there is some less restrictive and equally effective means, other than the procedures challenged [ ], to promote the goal of preventing smuggling of contraband into [prisons], the challenged procedures are not necessary to the security of the institution and are proscribed by Penal Code section 2601, subdivision (d).\u201d <em>(In re Bell </em>(1980) 110 Cal.App.3d 818, 822 [168 Cal.Rptr. 100].) \u201cHowever, this test does not require \u2018prison administrators to establish procedures which would jeopardize institutional security solely because they provide a lesser restriction on [an individual\u2019s] rights. Courts have only required that if the goal of reasonable institutional security can be effectively promoted by several different means, the least restrictive one be chosen.\u2019 \u201d <em>(In re Arias, supra, </em>at pp. 697-698, quoting <em>In re Stone, supra, </em>130 Cal.App.3d 922, 929, fns. omitted.) It is prison administrators\u2019 burden to establish the absence of less intrusive means of meeting their security needs. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 697, fn. 34.)</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">Respondents complain the Department has failed to show that less drastic steps cannot satisfy its administrative needs. They offer a list of alternative procedures that assertedly could be used to curtail smuggling without imposing such an extreme burden on inmates\u2019 visitation rights. For example, they question why officials could not forgo random searches of visitors\u2019 cars and, instead, conduct strip searches and body cavity inspections on inmates after contact visits, increase monitoring of visiting rooms to detect smuggling or use dogs to regularly search cells and other areas inside the prisons. While some of respondents\u2019 proposed procedural changes could be used in conjunction with the current search practices to help curtail the smuggling of contraband, none addresses the problem at the same level as the dog searches. Most of respondents\u2019 proposals are aimed at detecting and seizing drugs that have made it into prison; the dog search program was designed to intercept drugs at an earlier point. The program also is an effective deterrent, since it discourages visitors from attempting to bring contraband into prison property. Even those not so dissuaded will have second thoughts about proceeding with a planned visit once informed a dog search is in progress.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Because none of the alternatives proposed by respondents responds to the problem in exactly the same way as the dog search <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>program, we have concluded the visitor searches were a justifiable component of a comprehensive program to deal with the problem of contraband in the prisons.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">The judgment is modified in accordance with the views expressed herein and, as modified, affirmed. Each party to bear its own costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">Peterson, J\u201e<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b462-9\"> Prior to the search Ms. Ricker had signed a form consenting to a vehicle search before prison visits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b466-5\"> In this respect, the court observed, \u201ca prospective passenger has a choice: he may submit to a search of his person and immediate possessions as a condition to boarding; or he may turn around and leave. If he chooses to proceed, that choice, whether viewed as a relinquishment of an option to leave or an election to submit to the search, is essentially a \u2018consent,\u2019 granting the government a license to do what it would otherwise be barred from doing by the Fourth Amendment.\u201d (482 F.2d at p. 913.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b466-6\"> The Department argues the court\u2019s order denying their motion for summary judgment was flawed because it did not fulfill the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 437c, subdivision (g). That statute provides that, when denying a motion for summary judgment on the ground that a triable issue of fact remains, the court must (1) specify one or more material facts at issue; and (2) specifically refer to the evidence in support of and in opposition to the motion that indicates such a triable issue exists. While the court\u2019s order does specify the triable issues involved, it does not refer to the evidence demonstrating such issues exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">It is sufficient for us to observe that the Department never objected to this error below, and thus never permitted the trial court to remedy this easily correctable problem. Under such circumstances, we will not entertain this objection on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b466-8\"> The Department apparently recognizes that, even if the searches were consensual, the court was obligated to review the constitutionality of the search procedures. Acknowledging that the posting of warning signs does not permit it to \u201csubject visitors to any type of search, no matter how intrusive, without cause,\u201d the Department contends visitors\u2019 implied consent permits it to subject visitors to reasonable regulatory searches. It is obvious that in order to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>determine whether the searches were indeed reasonable the court had to address the issues noted above, and could not properly dispose of the matter on summary judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b467-10\"><em> Gold </em>v. <em>Los Angeles Democratic League </em>(1975) 49 Cal.App.3d 365 [122 Cal.Rptr. 732], which the Department cites in support of its position, is inapposite. In that case the complaint sought injunctive relief for acts committed in an election a year before the action was commenced. Because there was no evidence the defendants would repeat the acts the court denied injunctive relief. (49 Cal.App.3d at p. 373.) As we explain, the evidence regarding both <em>current searches </em>and past abuses supported the granting of injunctive relief in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b468-7\"> As respondents note, the evidence of early abuses also was relevant because the Department opposed all injunctive relief, which would have allowed it to resume the abusive practices it had abandoned by the time of trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b468-8\"> In a 1988 search at Folsom a visitor was simply to be dropped off at the prison; the driver and his children were nonetheless detained for over an hour while their car and belongings were searched.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b468-9\"> There was evidence of hour-long searches at Soledad and San Quentin during 1987 and 1988.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b468-10\"> The court\u2019s decision noted that in some cases the consent form was signed after the search began, in other cases the form was given to the visitor after the search began and in some instances no consent form was ever given to the visitor even after a strip search was conducted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b468-11\"> During a December 1987 search at Soledad, a dog was permitted to come within a foot of the visitor. During a search at San Quentin on August 6, 1988, one visitor reported the dogs were allowed to run free and come within \u201cinches\u201d of her; another witness testified that during his visit that day the dogs came within four feet of him and his wife.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b468-12\"> The Department does not challenge the conditions: (1) requiring written notice (in both English and Spanish) of the dog search policy to be provided all persons eligible to visit inmates, the reasons for the policy, and the consequences of finding contraband in the vehicle or on the person of the visitor; (2) permitting passengers to stay and complete their visit if the driver decides to leave; (3) prohibiting local law enforcement officers from being involved in or present at the search without valid reason and prohibiting the Department from reporting Vehicle Code violations to any law enforcement agency; (4) prohibiting the officers who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>conduct the searches from reading books, letters or other documents possessed by visitors not reasonably suspected of being contraband; and (5) requiring the Department to adopt regulations implementing the conditions imposed by the court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b469-10\"> In <em>McMorris </em>v. <em>Alioto, supra, </em>the court recognized that the consent given during administrative searches is a \u201cqualified consent,\u201d insufficient to constitute the sort of voluntary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>consent necessary to validate a warrantless, full-scale search for evidence of a crime. (567 F.2d at p. 901.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b470-10\">The Department notes the court did not feel the need to impose fixed time limits on the detention at issue in <em>Ingersoll </em>and thus suggest none were necessary here. It is equally likely, however, that <em>the </em>court did not impose specific limits in <em>Ingersoll </em>because the evidence proved the delays were already as brief and as minimally intrusive as possible.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b470-11\">The evidence clearly supported the trial court\u2019s determination that such time limits were necessary. For example, time records show that many searches conducted at Folsom State <em>Prison on </em>March 18, 1989\u2014three weeks before trial\u2014took longer than twenty minutes, not counting waiting time.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b474-7\"> The court noted that this standard is \u201cflexible enough to afford the full measure of fourth amendment protection without posing an insuperable barrier to the exercise of all search and seizure powers.\u201d (672 F.2d at p. 674.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b474-8\"> The alert was later attributed to the fact that the girl had earlier played with her dog, which was in heat.

Apparently, no similar right has yet been explicitly recognized for California courts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b479-9\"> While we recognize prison officials are still not required to give advance notice of the date of any particular search, the information required by the court\u2019s order to be given to visitors certainly helps alleviate the potential fear and annoyance caused by unannounced searches.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b480-7\"> In <em>In re Arias, supra, </em>42 Cal.3d 667, wards of the Youth Authority challenged the institution\u2019s right to install listening devices in the chapel of the school where they were being held.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b481-7\"> Respondents assert the sporadic use of the dog search procedure undercuts the Department\u2019s argument that the searches are necessary. We disagree. Regardless of whether the dog <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>searches are used regularly they provide a strong deterrent to attempted smugglers, since a visitor never knows when he or she may be subjected to a search.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b482-10\"> Respondents also suggest the dog searches are barred by the Department\u2019s own regulation. Code of Regulations, title 15, section 3173(e) states that \u201cAny person[s] coming onto the grounds of an institution, their vehicle and the articles of property in their possession are subject to inspection to whatever degree is consistent with the institution\u2019s security needs. Such inspections may include a search of a visitor\u2019s person, property and vehicle when there is substantial reason to believe the visitor is attempting to smuggle unauthorized items or substances in or out of the institution.\u201d According to respondents, this regulation permits summary inspections, but limits actual searches to situations where there is \u201csubstantial reason\u201d to believe the visitor is involved in smuggling. Because the dog searches are not based on individualized suspicion, respondents assert they violate the Department\u2019s own regulation concerning the propriety of visitor searches. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-11\">The Department\u2019s regulation concerns searches under the Fourth Amendment, and properly provides they may not be conducted without \u201csubstantial reason,\u201d i.e., probable cause, to believe the visitor is attempting to smuggle contraband. Because the regulation does <em>not </em>address the validity of searches conducted under the administrative search doctrine it cannot be interpreted as a bar to the dog searches involved here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b482-12\"> Presiding Justice of the Court of Appeal, First Appellate District, Division Five, sitting under assignment by the Chairperson of the Judicial Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b482-7\">BENSON, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AC9\">I concur in the majority\u2019s comprehensive opinion in this matter. I write separately to express my concern with the broad language used by the trial court in the portion of its judgment retaining jurisdiction to appoint a monitor. The judgment provides \u201cjurisdiction is expressly retained to appoint a monitor to act on behalf of the court, and to determine the precise duties of the monitor and provisions for compensation.\u201d The trial court\u2019s retention of jurisdiction to appoint a monitor \u201cto act on behalf of the court\u201d foreshadows a potentially unconstitutional delegation of judicial powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-8\">Unlike the federal courts, which have exercised what they have deemed their \u201cinherent equitable power\u201d to appoint monitors in prison reform cases (see <em>Ruiz </em>v. <em>Estelle </em>(5th Cir. 1982) 679 F.2d 1115, 1161; maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>p. 535, fn. 17), the power of California state courts to make such appointments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>is much more narrowly circumscribed. The statutory and constitutional limitations in California state courts were carefully delineated by Justice Butler of the Fourth District in <em>Aetna Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1986) 182 Cal.App.3d 431 [227 Cal.Rptr. 460]:</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">\u201cThe superior court has no power to assign matters to a referee for decision without explicit statutory authorization. <em>(In re Marriage of Galis </em>(1983) 149 Cal.App.3d 147, 150 [196 Cal.Rptr. 659]; <em>Bird </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1980) 112 Cal.App.3d 595, 599 [169 Cal.Rptr. 530]; see generally, 6 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (3d ed. 1985) Proceedings Without Trial, \u00a7 48.)</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">\u201cParticularly, the court has no power to make an unconsented-to general reference, which conclusively decides all or part of a matter, because not only is such a general reference not authorized except by explicit agreement of the parties ([Code Civ. Proc.,] \u00a7 638 . . .), but also, the California Constitution prevents delegation of judicial power except for the performance of \u2018subordinate judicial duties.\u2019 (Cal. Const., art. VI, \u00a7 22; see <em>In re Perrone C. </em>(1979) 26 Cal.3d 49 [160 Cal.Rptr. 704, 603 P.2d 1300]; <em>In re Edgar M. </em>(1975) 14 Cal.3d 727 [122 Cal.Rptr. 574, 537 P.2d 406].) Deciding a major legal issue in a case, which probably will determine liability, is not a subordinate judicial duty. The Supreme Court said in <em>In re Edgar M. </em>a referee can make a binding determination only in a consensual general reference. <em>(In re Edgar M., supra, </em>at p. 734; see [Code Civ. Proc.,] \u00a7\u00a7 638, 644; <em>Estate of Hart </em>(1938) 11 Cal.2d 89, 91 [77 P.2d 1082].)</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">\u201cThe statutes carefully preserve the distinction of special and general reference to comply with the constitutional mandate; a general reference has binding effect, but must be consensual, whereas a special reference may be ordered without consent but is merely advisory, not binding on the superior court. (See [Code Civ. Proc.,] \u00a7\u00a7 644, 645; <em>Estate of Bassi </em>(1965) 234 Cal.App.2d 529, 536-537 [44 Cal.Rptr. 541]; 6 Witkin, Cal.

In light of this objection and the prohibitions on the delegation of judicial power just discussed, any future appointment of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>monitor in this case must ensure that all actions taken by the monitor are purely advisory in nature and not binding on the superior court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">Peterson, J.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b484-5\"> The majority opinion observes that several injunctive conditions imposed by the trial court are not challenged by the department on appeal.
