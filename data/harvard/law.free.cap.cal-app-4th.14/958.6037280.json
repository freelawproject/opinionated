In a nutshell, the lawsuit involves a difference of opinion between an employer and an employee about the quality of the employee\u2019s work. A Hewlett-Packard supervisor, Hank Phelps, evaluated the employee, Jensen, as needing to improve his on-the-job performance in certain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"964\">*964</page-number>respects. Jensen took offense at the evaluation, claimed it was false, and accused Phelps of trying to hide his own incompetence. He demanded the evaluation be removed from his personnel file and challenged Phelps \u201cto prove his various allegations to an impartial factfinder.\u201d Hewlett-Packard investigated the matter and sided with Phelps. Jensen filed the underlying lawsuit, but continued working at Hewlett-Packard.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">As a prelude to our holding, we express our strong judicial disfavor for libel suits based on communications in employment performance reviews, particularly when, as here, the tort claim appears to be an attempted end run around <em>Foley </em>v. <em>Interactive Data Corp. </em>(1988) 47 Cal.3d 654 [254 Cal.Rptr. 211, 765 P.2d 373].<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In light of the multitude of laws designed to protect the employee from oppressive employment practices,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> evaluations serve the important business purpose of documenting the employer\u2019s hiring, promotion, discipline and firing practices. Moreover, the laudable practice of evaluating employees is to be encouraged for other important reasons. The performance review is a vehicle for informing the employee of what management expects, how the employee measures up, and what he or she needs to do to obtain wage increases, promotions or other recognition. Thus, the primary recipient and beneficiary of the communication is the employee. Tangential beneficiaries are ordinarily, as in the case here, all part of a management group with a common interest, i.e., the efficient running of the business.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"965\">*965</page-number>Clearly, there is a legitimate <em>raison d\u2019etre </em>for such records, and management has an unquestioned obligation to keep them. We would therefore be loathe to subject an employer to the threat of a libel suit in which a jury might decide, for instance, that the employee should have been given a rating of \u201caverage,\u201d rather than \u201cneeds improvement,\" or that the employee had an ability, unrecognized and unappreciated by a foolish supervisor, to get along with and lead others.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">Yet that result is exactly what Jensen intended to accomplish with his libel action against Hewlett-Packard: to have an \u201cimpartial factfinder\u201d judge whether Phelps was \u201cright\u201d or \u201cwrong\" in his criticisms of Jensen, which is to say whether Jensen was more valuable to Hewlett-Packard than the employer was willing to acknowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">Based on the facts here, we hold that unless an employer\u2019s performance evaluation falsely accuses an employee of criminal conduct, lack of integrity, dishonesty, incompetence or reprehensible personal characteristics or behavior (see <em>Polygram Records, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1985) 170 Cal.App.3d 543, 550 [216 Cal.Rptr. 252]), it cannot support a cause of action for libel. This is true even when the employer\u2019s perceptions about an employee\u2019s efforts, attitude, performance, potential or worth to the enterprise are objectively wrong and cannot be supported by reference to concrete, provable facts. Moreover, in light of <em>Foley, </em>where an employee alleges the employer\u2019s negative evaluations <em>are feigned, </em>the only potentially available remedy lies in contract, for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-7\">\n<em>Facts According to Jensen\u2019s Opening Statement</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b801-8\">The court may grant a motion for nonsuit after opening statement \u201cwhere it appears that counsel for plaintiff has stated all the facts that he [or she] expects to prove and that these would not make a prima facie case. [Citations.]\u201d (7 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (3d ed. 1985) Trial, \u00a7 416, p. 417.) While nonsuits at this stage are, in general, disfavored <em>(ibid.), </em>\u201cunnecessarily protracted litigation would have a chilling effect upon the exercise of First Amendment rights, [thus] speedy resolution of cases involving free speech is desirable.\u201d <em>(Good Government Group of Seal Beach, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 672, 685 [150 Cal.Rptr. 258, 586 P.2d 572].) We have no doubt that in defamation actions, nonsuit, like summary judgment, is \u201ca favored remedy.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b801-9\">To affirm a nonsuit, we assume the plaintiff will be able to prove the facts presented in the opening statement, but even so will be unable to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"966\">*966</page-number>prevail. <em>(Loral Corp. </em>v. <em>Moyes </em>(1985) 174 Cal.App.3d 268, 272 [219 Cal.Rptr. 836].) Jensen\u2019s opening statement included the following facts which he intended to prove:</p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\">He was hired by Hewlett-Packard in July 1983 and received favorable performance evaluations in February and August 1984. When Hewlett-Packard offered him management of a newly created area project center, he declined the position. His coworker, Hank Phelps, accepted the job and became Jensen\u2019s boss.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">Jensen received a merit salary increase in February 1985, but on May 10, Phelps gave him a written evaluation stating that while his work was adequate in certain respects, he had been the subject of some third party complaints, was not carrying his weight, had a negative attitude in dealing with others, evidenced a lack of direction in his project activities and was unwilling to take responsibility for the projects he oversaw.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Jensen objected to the evaluation in a letter to Phelps.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He then distributed the letter to other Hewlett-Packard managers, who told him, \u201cListen to your manager\u201d and, \u201cClean up your act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b803-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"967\">*967</page-number>Jensen demanded Hewlett-Packard initiate an internal investigation of the evaluation, and he insisted the offending document be removed from his personnel file. Informally, he was told the evaluation would be retracted, but later he received a written memorandum advising him Hewlett-Packard had completed its investigation and concluded Phelps\u2019s concerns were well-founded and thus the evaluation would remain in his personnel file.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">Jensen then brought the underlying suit, continuing to work at Hewlett-Packard. Phelps left the company, and Jensen was assigned to a new manager with whom he had no problems. He received assignments he deemed appropriate and, in February 1986, the manager gave him an evaluation Jensen thought was fair, even though it was critical in some respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">But then, in a corporate reorganization, Jensen was assigned to a new manager who, rather than giving Jensen his requested assignments, ordered him to take on projects Jensen thought too difficult, and then faulted Jensen for poor productivity. In October 1986, Jensen\u2019s development plan required him to do the work of a software engineer. He felt he was ill-suited for the job, but his demands that Hewlett-Packard provide him with assistance fell on deaf ears. In May 1987, he received an assignment to report for a project in San Diego, to resolve a computer software problem. He failed to show up as directed and was fired for insubordination. Jensen chose not to seek to amend his complaint to allege wrongful termination or constructive discharge. Rather, he proceeded solely on his claim that the Phelps evaluation was libelous and in breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the product of a conscious design intended to \u201cengineer\u201d the termination that eventually occurred two years later.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"968\">*968</page-number>Jensen said the evaluation was published to Hewlett-Packard management personnel,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and Phelps could not have had an honest and good faith belief in the truth of the statements because they were without a factual basis. Phelps, anticipating a poor review himself, was simply trying to cover up his own incompetence. He implicated supervisor Rod Smith in the false evaluation process, telling Jensen, \u201cI didn\u2019t do this alone.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\">Jensen maintained that as a result of the evaluation, he did not advance in his chosen position. His employee ranking declined and his job description ultimately changed. He was removed from project management, process control and factory automation\u2014areas in which he had expertise, and was given sales support tasks. He received no merit increases after the Phelps evaluation, nor was he considered for promotions or \u201ckey assignments.\u201d No one asked for his help on \u201csubstantive tasks.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">Jensen received an evaluation in February 1986, and two more in 1987.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> His counsel claimed: \u201cThe May 1985 evaluation started an entire chain of events. It ruined [Jensen\u2019s] employee standing and his perception as a valuable Hewlett-Packard employee,\u201d and, ultimately, it led to Jensen\u2019s termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">\n<em>The Motion for Nonsuit</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b804-7\"> pr|or t0 Jensen\u2019s supplemental opening statement, Hewlett-Packard and Smith moved for nonsuit under Code of Civil Procedure section 581c, subdivision (a),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> on the grounds of Jensen\u2019s failure to: (a) identify evaluation statements that could be deemed libelous; (b) state which statements were false and the facts showing why they were false; (c) identify evidence establishing malice; (d) state how and to whom the statements were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"969\">*969</page-number>published; (e) identify any special damages; (f) establish a causal relationship between the alleged defamation and the injury suffered;<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and (g) link Rod Smith to any of the statements.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">When Jensen completed his supplemental statement, Hewlett-Packard and Smith reiterated all of the above grounds as justifying a judgment of nonsuit. The court found Jensen had failed to present evidence of malice, publication \u201cin the literal sense of the law of libel,\u201d or causation of the claimed injuries or damages. It therefore granted the motion for nonsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b805-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b805-8\">The first ground raised by Hewlett-Packard was Jensen\u2019s failure to present facts demonstrating the evaluation statement was libelous.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>\n                   In defamation actions, it is entirely appropriate for the court to determine in the first instance \u201cwhether the publication could reasonably have been understood to have a libelous meaning.\u201d <em>(Kapellas </em>v. <em>Kofman </em>(1969) 1 Cal.3d 20, 34, fn. 14 [81 Cal.Rptr. 360, 459 P.2d 912].)</p>\n<p id=\"b805-9\">\u201cLibel is a false and unprivileged publication by writing . . . which exposes any person to hatred, contempt, ridicule, or obloquy, or which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"970\">*970</page-number>causes him [or her] to be shunned or avoided, or which has a tendency to injure him [or her] in his [or her] occupation.\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7 45.)  A publication \u201cmust contain a false statement of <em>fact\u201d </em>to give rise to liability for defamation. <em>(Gregory </em>v. <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. </em>(1976) 17 Cal.3d 596, 600 [131 Cal.Rptr. 641, 552 P.2d 425].) A statement of opinion \u201ccannot be false and is outside the meaning of libel.\u201d <em>(Tschirky </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1981) 124 Cal.App.3d 534, 539 [177 Cal.Rptr. 357].) \u201c[T]he dispositive question ... is \u2018whether a reasonable fact finder could conclude that the published statements imply a provably false factual assertion.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Kahn </em>v. <em>Bower </em>(1991) 232 Cal.App.3d 1599, 1607 [284 Cal.Rptr. 244], fn. omitted.) The court examines the communication in light of the <em>context </em>in which it was published. The communication\u2019s meaning must be considered in reference to relevant factors, such as the occasion of the utterance, the persons addressed, the purpose to be served, and \u201call of the circumstances attending the publication.\u201d <em>(Polygram Records, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>170 Cal.App.3d 543, 555.)</p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\">Under the above standards, could any of the comments in Phelps\u2019s evaluation reasonably be interpreted as false statements of fact? No. First, we note the context: The communication was a 14-page evaluation of Jensen\u2019s performance, prepared by Phelps in the course of his designated duties as Jensen\u2019s manager. It was one of a series of evaluations, less favorable than those that preceded <em>or </em>followed it. It documented one manager\u2019s assessment of Jensen\u2019s work habits, interpersonal skills and level of effort, and it outlined the employer\u2019s expectations with regard to Jensen\u2019s improvement. It was presented to Jensen for his review and its contents were seen by or made known to a number of management people who participated in periodic employee-ranking sessions. Jensen was given the opportunity to respond to the evaluation, which he did. There is absolutely nothing in the attendant circumstances tending to show the document constituted anything but business-as-usual.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">Next, the word \u201cevaluation\u201d denotes opinion, not fact.  \u201cEvaluation\u201d is defined in Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (1981) page 786, as \u201c. . . the act or result of evaluating: Judgment Appraisal, Rating, Interpretation.\u201d To \u201cevaluate\u201d is: \u201c. . . to examine and judge concerning the worth, quality, significance, amount, degree, or condition of.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em> The dictionary definition is not necessarily dispositive of the fact/opinion issue, but it certainly implies the defendants\u2019 intended legitimate purpose of the document, i.e., its use as a management tool for examining, appraising, judging and documenting the employee\u2019s performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">Finally, we turn to the contents of the evaluation, none of which suggests Jensen lacked honesty, integrity or the inherent competence, qualification, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"971\">*971</page-number>capability or fitness to do his job, or that he had reprehensible personal characteristics. Three categories of comments are involved: ratings by which Phelps expressed a value judgment, such as \u201cgood,\u201d \u201cacceptable\u201d or \u201cunacceptable,\u201d about Jensen\u2019s comparative level of skills, performance or attitude;<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> directions in which Phelps advised Jensen that he was expected to develop or improve in various areas;<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and general remarks about Jensen\u2019s attitude toward his job responsibilities and his coworkers.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">But even if the comments were objectively unjustified or made in bad faith, they could not provide a legitimate basis for Jensen\u2019s libel claim because they were statements of opinion, not false statements of fact.  Although the trial court did not grant the nonsuit based on that distinction, it clearly would have been authorized to do so: \u201cThe critical determination of whether the allegedly defamatory statement constitutes fact or opinion is a question of law. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Gregory </em>v. <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp., supra, </em>17 Cal.3d at p. 601.)  And the court\u2019s reliance on other grounds in granting the nonsuit is of no consequence; we may affirm on any ground advanced by defendant in the trial court if the plaintiff has been given notice of the defect and an opportunity to cure it. (See <em>Loral Corp. </em>v. <em>Moyes, supra, </em>174 Cal.App.3d 268, 272-273.)<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b808-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"972\">*972</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\"> Our affirmance of the nonsuit judgment accords with <em>Foley </em>v. <em>Interactive Data Corp., supra, </em>47 Cal.3d 654. Jensen\u2019s suit looks like an action for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Indeed, he began by alleging such a theory of recovery, but he chose to drop it, perhaps in light of <em>Foley's </em>damage limitation.  In any event, Jensen claims there was no basis in fact for Phelps\u2019s criticisms: He says Phelps only <em>pretended </em>to have a bad opinion about his worth as an employee because Phelps anticipated receiving a poor evaluation himself and was looking for a scapegoat. In other words, Phelps prepared the evaluation knowing there was no reasonable basis for his negative comments and for the sole purpose of avoiding responsibility for his own failings. This is a classic statement of breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">Analogous claims were made by the plaintiff in <em>Burton </em>v. <em>Security Pacific Nat. Bank </em>(1988) 197 Cal.App.3d 972 [243 Cal.Rptr. 277], where the appellate court affirmed a summary judgment in favor of the defendant employer. The employee had been fired for reading confidential materials kept in a restricted area. He denied the accusation, claiming he had been reading nonconfidential material in an open area. The employee alleged the reason given by the employer for his termination was untrue and used as a pretext; the employer actually wanted to get rid of him before he filed a grievance for the employer\u2019s prior violation of internal policy. But the employee had no material facts to support the pretext theory, and undisputed facts showed the employer had investigated the charge before terminating him. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"973\">*973</page-number>We cite at length the <em>Burton </em>court\u2019s apt discussion. \u201cThe thrust of appellant\u2019s argument is that the claim that he was in a confidential area, reading confidential materials, was untrue and used as a pretext to legitimate his termination. [Citation.] He asserts that this factual dispute raised a material factual issue. H] Appellant has not brought forth one fact to support his theory that respondent contrived a reason for his discharge. [Citation.] Appellant\u2019s assertion is based solely on conjecture and speculation. His only factual claim is that he told his supervisor and another employee named Delores that he was going to file a grievance .... He offers no factual evidence, circumstantial or otherwise, that respondent or any supervisor fired appellant for this reason. Summary judgment was proper since there was no factual foundation for appellant\u2019s claim that the stated reason for discharge, being in the confidential area reading confidential materials, was a mere pretext for some other, impermissible reasons. [Citation.] [][] Appellant\u2019s claim that he was not in fact in the confidential area reading confidential materials raises no issue of bad faith on the part of respondent. An implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing requires only that the employer act fairly and in good faith. [Citation.] To be entitled to a trial for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, appellant must bring forth facts to show that respondent acted in \u2018bad faith\u2019 and without \u2018probable cause.\u2019 [Citations.] Undisputed facts show that respondent investigated the charge that appellant was in the confidential area reading confidential materials. Appellant discussed the incident with at least two of respondent\u2019s employees, including the vice president of corporate employee relations. The assistant vice president personnel officer examined the area and documents in question; and there were at least three conversations among management personnel to discuss the allegations. Appellant presented no contrary evidence that respondent lacked probable cause to believe that appellant was in a confidential area reading confidential materals [sic] or that respondent lacked a good faith belief the charge was true. [][] Appellant denied the charge, and respondent chose to believe other witnesses and to reject appellant\u2019s version. This raises no inference of bad faith on respondent\u2019s part.\u201d <em>(Burton </em>v. <em>Security Pacific Nat. Bank, supra, </em>197 Cal.App.3d 972, 978-979.)</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">The <em>Burton </em>court noted it is \u201cvery common\u201d for an employee to deny the existence of a basis for an employer\u2019s criticism. (197 Cal.App.3d at p. 979.)  But where it is undisputed the employer has conducted an investigation and determined the issue against the employee, \u201cthere is no breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, <em>even if the employee could subsequently prove that the factual finding of misconduct was a mistake. </em>H] If the law were otherwise, no employment contract could be \u2018at will\u2019 .... If the employee were entitled to jury trial for breach of the implied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"974\">*974</page-number>covenant of good faith and fair dealing merely by asserting that the charged misconduct was not true, the decision to terminate would be at the discretion of a jury, not the employer.  The law of employment contracts would be turned on its head.\u201d <em>(Burton </em>v. <em>Security Pacific Nat. Bank, supra, </em>197 Cal.App.3d 972, 979, italics added.)<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\"><em>Burton, </em>a <em>pre-Foley </em>decision that survives <em>Foley, </em>cannot be distinguished meaningfully from the instant case. Jensen believed Phelps\u2019s evaluation of him to be false and in bad faith. He complained to other supervisors, who basically told him he should try to meet his supervisor\u2019s expectations. He complained to his employer, and his employer conducted an investigation and decided his complaint was not well taken. Jensen was not entitled to a jury\u2019s reevaluation of the matter.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> His opening statement made clear he could present no more than pure conjecture and speculation on the issue of pretext/bad faith. He was not entitled to proceed under a theory of breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">The <em>Foley </em>court cautions it is poor policy to create an atmosphere of fear of liability which stifles management from exercising its \u201c \u2018fundamental prerogatives . . . : to control the workplace and to retain only the best-qualified employees\u2019.\u201d <em>(Foley </em>v. <em>Interactive Data Corp., supra, </em>47 Cal.3d 654, 696, fn. 33.) Here, there is no claim that the negative evaluation was fabricated as a pretext for prohibited discrimination; rather there is only Jensen\u2019s unsubstantiated charge his supervisor\u2019s opinion was objectively wrong and subjectively feigned. Under <em>Foley's </em>admonitions regarding managerial discretion, we are compelled to conclude the court is an inappropriate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"975\">*975</page-number>forum for resolution of this grievance. No matter the denomination of the cause of action, employers should neither be required to justify performance evaluations by reference to objectively provable facts, nor subjected to fear of liability for good faith, but mistaken, judgments about the value of an individual employee to the business enterprise.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">Judgment affirmed. Jensen shall bear the costs of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">Sills, P. J., and Wallin, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b800-5\"><em> Foley </em>holds: \u201c[T]ort remedies are not available for breach of the implied covenant [of good faith and fair dealing] in an employment contract to employees who allege they have been discharged in violation of the covenant.\u201d <em>(Foley </em>v. <em>Interactive Data Corp., supra, </em>47 Cal.3d 654, 700, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">Jensen\u2019s suit was filed before <em>Foley </em>was published\u2014when a discharged employee could recover tort damages for the employer\u2019s breach of the implied covenant. <em>(Cleary </em>v. <em>American Airlines, Inc. </em>(1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 443 [168 Cal.Rptr. 722].)

His main job focus as \u2018project manager\u2019 has been questioned at times by customers, 3rd parties and peers. Lack of concern for information needed by HP mgmt has substantiated these observations.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b802-8\">The employer\u2019s expectations for improvement are also set out, e.g.: \u201cProvide accurate, pro-active approach to project business by: [5] (1) documenting all verbal correspondence (CPC) [5] (2) exhibiting ownership for project problems (CPC) and [1] (3) taking ownership during project changes and treating all project team members with professionalism.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b802-9\">At the end of the evaluation form, there is a page for employee remarks, with the advisement: \u201cEach individual evaluated is encouraged to add any comments to this review. If additional space is needed, attach a separate sheet to this form.\u201d The employee is asked to sign an acknowledgement that he or she has met with the manager and discussed the evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-10\">During his supplemental opening statement, Jensen read to the jury all of the employer\u2019s evaluation comments, negative and positive.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b802-11\"> In his 12-page response dated June 7, 1985, Jensen took exception to every comment in the evaluation, asserting what he was being asked to do in the future he had already been doing in the past and the deficiencies cited were nonexistent. Here is a representative sample of Jensen\u2019s remarks: \u201cYou say that I have not been an effective communicator with corporate and third parties, and I dispute that; it is not true. You say that you have heard complaints about me, but you have never previously advised me of them or counseled me about them. [1] You say that there have been complaints about my being inflexible and undependable, but that is directly contrary to my prior evaluations. ... I have not done anything since August 31, 1984 to warrant your totally contrary evaluation. [J] You say that my productivity is perceived as low, although it is as good or better than others in my group. You say that my <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"967\">*967</page-number>judgment is questionable, but again, your evaluation is totally contrary to my prior evaluations.\u201d Jensen\u2019s response extended even to a rating of \u201cgood\u201d in one category as unacceptable.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-9\">In the \u201cemployee comments\u201d sheet from Hewlett-Packard\u2019s evaluation form, he stated: \u201cThis evaluation is utter nonsense. It is prejudiced, and reflects Mr. Phelps\u2019 attempt to place the blame for his own failings and incompetence on me. H] I . . . challenge Mr. Phelps to prove his various allegations to an impartial factfinder. ... I request that a copy of my letter be attached hereto as a permanent part of this evaluation, should this evaluation become a permanent part of my employment record. [J] The foregoing, and my June 7, 1985 letter, are without prejudice.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b803-11\"> Jensen alleged: \u201cBy reason of the wrongful acts previously alleged here, e.g., by permitting Phelps and Smith to falsify the May 85 Evaluation, and by reneging upon the initial agreement to withdraw the May 85 Evaluation from Jensen\u2019s permanent employment record, and instead retaining the Evaluation there, although knowing it to be false in every material respect, Hewlett Packard ratified or approved the wrongful acts complained of herein, and thereby engaged in bad faith action vis-a-vis Jensen extraneous to the oral employment agreement with Jensen, with the intent to frustrate Jensen\u2019s employment of his contractual rights thereunder, including but not limited to Jensen\u2019s right to receive and be judged at Hewlett Packard on the basis of honest and truthful performance evaluations on a periodic basis, not a falsified evaluation intentionally calculated to make him a scapegoat for his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"968\">*968</page-number>supervisors\u2019 poor performance and to engineer Jensen\u2019s termination as a Hewlett Packard employee.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b804-10\"> The individuals named by Jensen\u2019s counsel were all identified by Hewlett-Packard, without contradiction, as managers or management personnel with a business-related interest in the evaluation. Jensen\u2019s counsel speculated that persons \u201cmay have seen\u201d the evaluation, but speculation does not prove publication as to such persons, and we disregard the statement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b804-11\"> Copies of the 1987 evaluations were not given to Jensen at the time. In his opening statement, Jensen\u2019s counsel did not reveal the contents of those evaluations. Thus, we are in the dark about how his performance was perceived by management in 1987. With regard to the contents of the 1986 evaluation, the only reasonable inference is that it was favorable to Jensen since he took no exception to it and his counsel stated: \u201c[E]ven the . . . February 3, 1986 evaluation, was not enough to <em>raise </em>his ranking [after the 1985 evaluation.]\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b804-12\"> All further statutory references are to the Code of Civil Procedure unless otherwise specified.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b805-10\"> Citing <em>John Norton Farms, Inc. </em>v. <em>Todagco </em>(1981) 124 Cal.App.3d 149, 161 [177 Cal.Rptr. 215], Jensen contends we may not consider the causation ground because it was raised sua sponte by the court. Indeed, Hewlett-Packard\u2019s initial motion for nonsuit following the opening statement did not address the defect; the court alluded to lack of causation in colloquy with counsel following the opening statement. But Jensen\u2019s counsel was given the chance to make a supplemental statement, and before he did so, he queried the court: \u201cThe only thing is, I need to know what I need to address in order to cure the defects. I\u2019m still at a loss as to what it is that I need to address.\u201d Counsel for Hewlett-Packard then, <em>before </em>Jensen\u2019s counsel began his supplemental opening statement, stated all grounds for its renewed motion for nonsuit, including the causation ground. Thus, Jensen obviously had ample notice that he needed to state the facts bearing on <em>all </em>issues he would need to prove, including causation, and his reliance on the <em>John Norton Farms </em>case is inapt.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b805-11\"> This constitutes a legitimate basis for the judgment of nonsuit in favor of Smith. Phelps\u2019s oblique remark about not having \u201cdone this alone\u201d does not give rise to a permissible inference that Smith participated in preparation, planning or dissemination of the evaluation and Jensen presented no other facts linking Smith to publication of any defamatory statements.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b805-12\"> In his renewed motion for nonsuit, Hewlett-Packard\u2019s counsel said: \u201cI do not believe that the plaintiff has identified any statement as a libelous statement, that is to say he has not identified a statement in the evaluation which he believed is libelous which would allow this court to test that at this stage whether or not that statement is in fact libelous or whether or not the jury is to ever find that it was libelous. [1] Second, he has not identified a statement that he contends was false, that is to say he has not advanced a factual statement which this court or a jury could find was a factual statement and could conclude that in fact it was a false statement.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b807-6\"> The rating words are defined in the form: \u201cExceptional: Performance consistently far exceeds expectations. [1] Very Good: Performance consistently exceeds normal expectations and job requirements. [1] Good: Performance consistently meets expectations and job requirements. [J] Acceptable: Performance usually meets expectations and minimum requirements for the job. [f] Unacceptable: Performance is below the minimum acceptable level.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b807-7\"> For instance, Phelps advised Jensen: to work on reestablishing \u201chealthy, constructive\u201d relationships with third parties, peers and Hewlett-Packard managers; to learn the technical aspects of a project, including its support installations, sales and teaching components; to work on becoming a \u201ccompetent resource person\u201d; to refrain from making negative comments about third parties and staff people; to learn to become confident with an assigned project; and to complete steps to help establish himself as a productive company team player. Phelps warned Jensen that if he did not see efforts to remedy the problems, Jensen might be placed on probation or even terminated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b807-8\"> Phelps said Jensen had not \u201cincreased his skill\u201d in project definition and control; was not \u201cpulling his weight\u201d in meeting various sales objectives; appeared to lack concern for management\u2019s need for information; had \u201cweak\u201d knowledge of project management and process control; showed \u201clack of direction, inflexibility and lack of dependability\u201d causing \u201cunnecessary\u201d delays in projects and \u201cfinger-pointing\u201d; had a productivity \u201cperceived as low\u201d due to his \u201clack of personal ownership of tasks\u201d; displayed \u201cquestionable judgment\u201d in pursing personal \u201cvindication\u201d concerning \u201cbehavioral problems\u201d and in breaching confidentiality of personnel matters between him and Phelps; did not \u201cextend\u201d himself by giving \u201ca helping hand or pitching in\u201d; projected an \u201cattitude of if it\u2019s not my job, it\u2019s your problem\u201d; displayed a \u201clack of attention\u201d to tasks and \u201coverall communication with the team\u201d; and was the subject of a \u201ctremendous amount of negative feedback.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b807-9\"> Had Jensen proved libelous statements, we would still affirm the nonsuit judgment because he presented no evidence of causation. Neither in his opening statement nor in his supplemental did he do more than recite the ways in which his work life changed between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"972\">*972</page-number>1985 and 1987. He did not say he would show he was eligible for the salary increases he claims he should have received, or that the work he wanted was generally available, or that any witness would testify he should not have been reassigned to sales support, or that he would prove he would have progressed differently at Hewlett-Packard had the negative evaluation been retracted. Moreover, Jensen admitted Phelps\u2019s immediate successor gave him the work he wanted and wrote an acceptable evaluation in February 1986, and the two 1987 evaluations which Jensen\u2019s counsel failed to reveal also may have been acceptable. There can be no legitimate inference the Phelps evaluation poisoned the well and changed the course of Jensen\u2019s career with Hewlett-Packard.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-7\">As aptly noted in <em>Biggins </em>v. <em>Hanson </em>(1967) 252 Cal.App.2d 16, 24 [59 Cal.Rptr. 897], where plaintiff\u2019s former supervisor allegedly uttered defamatory statements in connection with plaintiff\u2019s termination: \u201cThe fact that plaintiff\u2019s income decreased after the libel is quite irrelevant unless he can show some causal connection.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b808-8\"> \"'[T]he implied-in-law covenant of good faith and fair dealing protects the right of the parties to an agreement to receive the benefits of the agreement that they have entered into. The denial of a party\u2019s rights to those benefits, whatever they are, will breach the duty of good faith implicit in the contract. Thus, <em>the relevant inquiry always will focus on the contract itself to determine what the parties did agree to.\u2019 </em>[Citation.]\u201d <em>(Foley </em>v. <em>Interactive Data Corp., supra, </em>47 Cal.3d 654, 699, fn. 41.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b810-6\"> The law of employment contracts would likewise be turned on its head if management had to justify to the employee\u2019s satisfaction each evaluative comment deemed unfair by the employee. Yet, this is precisely the burden Jensen sought to impose on the employer, as repeatedly demonstrated in his opening statement. For instance: \u201cFollowing the evaluation, after it was issued and when . . . Mr. Jensen had raised his objections to it, Mr. Phelps and Mr. Jensen had a conversation. Mr. Phelps approached Mr. Jensen, he said he wanted to negotiate things, he said he was willing to take out some of the comments but he wanted to leave some in. He wanted Mr. Jensen to meet him halfway. He said that\u2019s a win/win situation, that they would both win. Mr. Jensen said no, the evaluation is <em>false, this is not a negotiation. You have to substantiate it, show me what they are. </em>If don\u2019t [ric], you\u2019ve got to retract them.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b810-7\">The test of good faith and fair dealing cannot be whether management is willing or able to identify, on demand, specific instances justifying a negative evaluation. Indeed, the conduct of management is presumed fair and reasonable until a disgruntled employee proves otherwise. Under <em>Burton, </em>the employee\u2019s claim that the employer lied is not sufficient to shift the burden. <em>(Burton </em>v. <em>Security Pacific Nat. Bank, supra, </em>197 Cal.App.3d 972, 979.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b810-8\"> As noted in <em>Foley, </em>\u201c \u2018Juries in these cases often impose liability and large damage awards according to their own standards of fairness rather than the legal instructions provided by the judge. . . . H] Jurors can easily identify with the worker who has received a pink slip.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Foley </em>v. <em>Interactive Data Corp., supra, 47 </em>Cal.3d 654, 697, fn. 36.) The comment is equally appropriate in the context of employee performance evaluations.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
