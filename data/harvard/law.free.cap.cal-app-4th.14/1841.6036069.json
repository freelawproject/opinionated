The two felony charges were driving with a blood-alcohol level of 0.08 percent or more with three or more similar prior convictions within the past seven years (Veh. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 23152, subd. (b), 23175), and driving while under the influence with three or more similar prior convictions within the past seven years (Veh. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 23152, subd. (a), 23175). The misdemeanors are not relevant to the instant appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1541-9\">Apparently appellant was released on bail or his own recognizance on the Fresno County charges on October 22, 1990. Thereafter, on December 22, 1990, appellant was involved in a head-on collision during a high-speed pursuit in Merced County. Timothy Randolph, the driver of the other vehicle, died as a direct result of the collision. Appellant\u2019s blood-alcohol level was more than twice the legal limit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1541-10\">Appellant was thereafter charged in Merced County with eight felony counts, including murder, gross vehicular manslaughter, driving under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1844\">*1844</page-number>influence, evading arrest and auto theft. A section 12022.1 enhancement was alleged as to each count. Appellant admitted the truth of these enhancements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1542-4\">After a jury trial, appellant was found guilty of each of the eight charged Merced County offenses.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1542-5\">At appellant\u2019s Merced County sentencing on November 13, 1991, the following discussion occurred as regards sentencing generally, and the section 12022.1 enhancements in particular:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1542-6\">\u201c[Prosecutor]: The enhancement, Judge, I think you are just bound by case law which suggests that whenever there is a conviction for the secondary offense, which this is because\u2014an enhancement is proved, and the person is sentenced on the secondary offense prior to conviction of the primary offense, the imposition of the enhancement shall be stayed pending the imposition of sentence for the primary offense. The stay shall be lifted upon the court hearing the primary offense at the time of sentencing for that offense and shall be reported on the abstract of judgment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1542-7\">\u201cSo we would just ask you to follow the law on that and stay that until the matter is resolved in the other county for the primary offense. With that I submit it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1542-8\">\u201cThe Court: Thank you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1542-9\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: I would agree with that latter part, your Honor. That was included in my memo.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1542-10\">\u201cThe Court: Any cause why legal sentence should not be imposed at this time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1542-11\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: No cause, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1542-12\">\u201cThe Court: Mr. Alaniz, will you please stand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1542-13\">\u201cOn Count I it will be the sentence of the court that you be sentenced to fifteen years to life imprisonment. On] Count VIII I\u2019m going to sentence you to the mid term of two years to be served consecutively, on Count IX that will be six months, that will be served concurrently, that\u2019s the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1845\">*1845</page-number>misdemeanor. Counts II, III, IV, V, VI and VII are stayed as is the enhancement pending the resulting finding down in the lower court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1543-5\">Following his commitment to prison by the Merced court, appellant was returned to Fresno County on the charges pending there. On January 22, 1992, appellant admitted to the violation of Vehicle Code sections 23152, subdivision (a), and 23175 (driving under the influence with three or more similar prior convictions). The remaining counts were dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1543-6\">On February 19, 1992, appellant waived formal arraignment and was sentenced by the Fresno County Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1543-7\">Initially, the court imposed a sentence of a two-year middle base term, run consecutive to the Merced determinate sentence as one-third the base term, or eight months. Appellant then informed the court that the section 12022.1 enhancement in the Merced case was \u201ctrailing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1543-8\">The court examined the text of section 12022.1 and concluded that \u201c[t]he defendant is probably right. The 12022.1 has been stayed pending sentencing on the primary offense. \u2018The stay shall be lifted by the Court hearing the primary offense,\u2019 that\u2019s me, \u2018at the time of the sentencing for that offense and shall be recorded in the abstract of judgment.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1543-9\">\u201cThe Court: So it\u2019s an eight months on this case, which is statutory one-third the mid term, and that\u2019s the primary offense, and that\u2019s because we can\u2019t change anything about it. The offense in Merced County is the principal term because it\u2019s an indeterminate 15-to-life. It is the principal term.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1543-10\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1543-11\">\u201cThe Court: So this case, as I see it, the only thing we can do without more clarity\u2014if anybody knows some case law on this statute, I\u2019m not aware of any\u2014is to impose the eight months, lift the stay on the 12022.1 two-year, and the rest of the sentence from Merced has been imposed, so it gives him a two-year-eight-month determinate plus a 15-to-life indeterminate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1543-12\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Okay. Now we can\u2019t lift the stay on Merced, they have to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1543-13\">\u201cThe Court: That\u2019s exactly what the Penal Code says I have to do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1543-14\">\u201c[Probation Officer]: He has to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1544-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1846\">*1846</page-number>\u201cThe Court: It\u2019s exactly what it says I have to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1544-4\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Okay. In any event I\u2019ll be requesting that this sentence of two years be concurrent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1544-5\">\u201cThe Court: All right. Submit it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1544-6\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Submit it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1544-7\">\u201cThe Court: It\u2019s imposed consecutive. I\u2019ll lift the stay on the 12022.1 or order that the case be remanded to Merced County for that purpose. It is\u2014it is the stated approval of this Court of the plea condition to result in a total sentence of two years eight months determinate to be followed by 15 years to life indeterminate for the second degree murder out of Merced county.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1544-8\">\u201cIf for any reason, legal or discretionary from another county this sentence is not imposed properly, I\u2019ll reserve jurisdiction to bring the case back and attempt to straighten it out. Okay?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1544-9\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Okay.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1544-10\">The court awarded appellant 666 days of presentence custody credits as calculated in the probation report, consisting of 444 actual local custody credits and 222 local conduct credits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1544-11\">The Fresno abstract of judgment does not mention the lifting of the Merced County stay. In addition, it reflects that appellant was sentenced to a two-year term rather than only one-third (eight months) of the midterm for the conviction under Vehicle Code sections 23152, subdivision (a), and 23175.</p>\n<p id=\"b1544-12\">On February 25, 1992, the Fresno court made a minute order vacating its previous order to transport appellant to Merced County for further proceedings. Instead, appellant was ordered transported to a state correctional institution.</p>\n<p id=\"b1544-13\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1544-14\">I. <em>Imposition of section 12022.1 enhancement.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1544-15\">The issue presented here revolves around that portion of section 12022.1, subdivision (d) which directs that when the defendant is sentenced for the secondary offense, \u201cimposition of the enhancement shall be stayed\u201d and \u201c[t]he stay shall be lifted by the court hearing the primary offense at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1847\">*1847</page-number>time of sentencing for that offense. . . .\u201d Appellant contends the enhancement has never been imposed and can only be imposed by the Merced court. Respondent argues that the Merced court imposed but stayed the enhancement, or at least made it \u201cformally of-record\u201d and that the Fresno court\u2019s lifting the stay completed the process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1545-5\">If the record supported respondent\u2019s contention, we would agree with its argument. As we shall explain, we see no reason why the court sentencing for the secondary offense could not impose but stay execution of the enhancement pending sentencing for the primary offense. If the stay is then lifted by the court hearing the primary offense, nothing remains to be done.</p>\n<p id=\"b1545-6\">There is, of course, a distinction between suspending imposition of sentence and suspending the execution of a sentence which has been imposed. This is best evidenced by the probation statutes. For example, section 1203.1 begins: \u201cThe court or judge thereof, in the order granting probation, may suspend the imposing, or the execution, of the sentence . . . .\u201d (See generally, 3 Witkin &amp; Epstein, Cal. Criminal Law (2d ed. 1989) \u00a7\u00a7 1659-1661, pp. 1970-1972.) The same distinction apparently applies to enhancements. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Bell </em>(1984) 159 Cal.App.3d 323, 329 [205 Cal.Rptr. 568] [enhancements imposed, but execution partially stayed to comply with double-the-base-term limitation]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Whigam </em>(1984) 158 Cal.App.3d 1161, 1169 [205 Cal.Rptr. 227] [same].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1545-7\">Thus, it is arguable that the Legislature intended to distinguish between a stay of imposition and a stay of execution for an \u201con-bail\u201d enhancement attaching to a secondary offense conviction when the primary offense is still pending. A review of the statute\u2019s history, however, convinces us otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b1545-8\">The procedural provisions of section 12022.1 dealing with cases in which sentencing on the secondary offense precedes sentencing on the primary offense were added by amendment in 1985. (Stats. 1985, ch. 533, \u00a7 1, p. 1905.) The amendment\u2019s legislative history shows that its purpose was to overrule certain appellate court decisions, specifically including <em>Panos </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1984) 156 Cal.App.3d 626 [203 Cal.Rptr. 115]. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Bar\u00edes </em>(1989) 209 Cal.App.3d 313, 321 [256 Cal.Rptr. 920].) In <em>Panos, </em>the issue was the propriety of imposing an on-bail enhancement under section 12022.1 when, at the time of sentencing on the second offense, there had been no conviction on the offense leading to the defendant\u2019s on-bail status. In other words, the setting in <em>Panos </em>was the same presented to the Merced court here. The difference was that when <em>Panos </em>was decided, section 12022.1 did not provide a mechanism for imposing the enhancement if sentencing on the secondary offense took place prior to conviction on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1848\">*1848</page-number>primary offense. The appellate court issued a writ of prohibition barring further proceedings on the enhancement. Notable in the opinion is the following language:</p>\n<p id=\"b1546-4\">\u201cThe trial court determined and the People urge us to find that conviction on the earlier Los Angeles felony is a necessary predicate only for execution of the enhanced penalty and is not an essential element of the enhancement charge itself. Thus, the argument goes, if the court in Sacramento finds the section 12022.1 enhancement to be true as alleged even without proof the earlier felony resulted in a conviction, the enhanced penalty can be imposed but its execution must be stayed pending factual resolution of the Los Angeles charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1546-5\">\u201cWe decline to adopt the People\u2019s interpretation because it would add to the statute a dimension which is neither expressly included in nor suggested by its plain language. Penal Code section 12022.1 addresses various sentencing possibilities <em>after </em>a conviction on the earlier felony offense has been established, but it significantly fails to provide a mechanism for imposing and then staying service of the penalty enhancement pending a conviction on the earlier felony charge.\u201d (156 Cal.App.3d at pp. 629-630.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1546-6\">As noted, the Legislature responded to <em>Panos </em>by amending section 12022.1 in 1985. The amendment was embodied in Senate Bill No. 343 which, in its final form, passed both houses of the Legislature without a dissenting vote. We have examined the legislative history of the bill. Nothing in that history indicates an intent to preclude the court sentencing for the secondary offense from imposing the enhancement and then staying its execution. On the contrary, several \u201cSenate Floor Analyses\u201d and committee analyses of the bill explicitly indicate the intent was to \u201callow the court to impose the two-year enhancement, once there was a conviction for the secondary offense, but the enhancement would be stayed pending conviction for the primary offense.\u201d (See Rep. of Sen. Com. on Judiciary, Sen. Bill No. 343 (1985-1986 Reg. Sess.) Apr. 16, 1985; Sen. Floor Analysis of Sen. Bill No. 343 (1985-1986 Reg. Sess.) May 1, 1985 and July 16, 1985.) These statements evidence an intent to provide what the <em>Panos </em>court noted was previously lacking (\u201ca mechanism for imposing and then staying service of the penalty enhancement pending a conviction on the earlier felony charge\u201d). (156 Cal.App.3d at p. 630.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1546-7\">Moreover, several analyses of the bill indicate that there would be no \u201clocal\u201d fiscal effect. However, if the court hearing the secondary offense may not stay execution of the enhancement but only its imposition, that court must, after the court hearing the primary offense has lifted the stay, hold another sentencing hearing to impose the enhancement. Under those circumstances there would obviously be <em>some </em>local fiscal impact.</p>\n<p id=\"b1547-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1849\">*1849</page-number>The legislative history, in the light of Panos, clearly indicates that the intent of that portion of the 1985 amendment in question here was to preserve the enhancement until there had been convictions on both the primary and secondary offenses. That purpose is as well served by an order staying execution of the enhancement as it is by an order staying imposition at the first sentencing. And the failure of the Legislature to provide that the court hearing the primary offense should order transfer of the defendant to the other court after lifting the stay is some indication that the Legislature contemplated that the stay would be of the enhancement\u2019s execution so that further judicial action was unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1547-4\">Even though the statute\u2019s language (\u201cthe imposition of the enhancement shall be stayed\u201d) appears unambiguous, \u201c\u2018\u201c[t]he literal meaning of the words . . . may be disregarded to give effect to manifest purposes that, in the light of the statute\u2019s legislative history, appear from its provisions considered as a whole.\u201d \u2019 [Citations.]\u2019\u2019 <em>(Leffel </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1976) 54 Cal.App.3d 569, 572 [126 Cal.Rptr. 773].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1547-5\">We conclude that the Merced court could have imposed but stayed execution of the enhancement. Unfortunately, the record does not support respondent\u2019s contention that the Merced court did so. Before sentence was pronounced, the prosecutor advised the Merced court that \u201cimposition of the enhancement shall be stayed pending the imposition of sentence for the primary offense.\u201d Defense counsel agreed with that statement. The court then imposed sentence on certain counts, but ordered that \u201cCounts II, III, IV, V, VI and VII are stayed <em>as is the </em>enhancement. . . .\u201d (Italics added.) The court never advised appellant his sentence was being enhanced, but that execution of the enhancement was stayed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1547-6\">Respondent takes a fallback position, relying on language in a recent decision of our state\u2019s Supreme Court. In <em>People </em>v. <em>McClanahan </em>(1992) 3 Cal.4th 860 [12 Cal.Rptr.2d 719, 838 P.2d 241] the court held that an on-bail enhancement was subject to the double-the-base-term limitation of section 1170.1. In discussing the procedural provisions of section 12022.1, subdivision (d), the court said: \u201c. . . Thus, a defendant can be convicted of the new (secondary) offense, the on-bail enhancement \u2018proved,\u2019 and sentence on that offense pronounced-all <em>before </em>a conviction of the primary offense is obtained. Under those circumstances, imposition of the on-bail enhancement, already pleaded, proved, and formally of-record, is stayed pending conviction and imposition of sentence for the primary offense; . . .\u201d <em>(McClanahan, supra, </em>at p. 870.) Respondent suggests that in this case the Merced court \u201cstayed the imposition of the on-bail enhancement while at the same time making it \u2018formally of-record.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1548-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1850\">*1850</page-number>We are not persuaded. First, in <em>McClanahan </em>the primary and secondary offenses were consolidated for trial in the same court, so the stay provisions of section 12022.1, subdivision (d) were not in play, and the Supreme Court\u2019s comments about that subdivision do not constitute a holding. Additionally, the Supreme Court did not explain its \u201cformally of-record\u201d reference and gave no guidance on how an enhancement is made \u201cformally of-record.\u201d The phrase seems to indicate some action in addition to merely staying the enhancement. Nothing in the Merced court\u2019s record, however, shows the court did anything other than stay the enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1548-4\">When the judgment in the instant action, including the order lifting stay, becomes final, the Merced court will be free to impose the enhancement, assuming the Merced judgment is affirmed on appeal. If the Merced judgment is affirmed, we believe the proper procedure would then be for this court to remand that case to the Merced Superior Court to deal with the enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1548-5\">The statute does not confer power on the Fresno court to do anything with respect to the enhancement other than lift the stay. We see no basis upon which the Fresno court can impose an enhancement to the Merced court\u2019s sentence when the enhancement was pleaded and proved in the Merced action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1548-6\">The question remains whether the Fresno court, in the action under review, effectively lifted the stay ordered by the Merced court. As originally announced by the court below, the order was somewhat equivocal: \u201cI\u2019ll lift the stay on the 12022.1 or order that the case be remanded to Merced County for that purpose.\u201d Subsequently, the court issued a minute order vacating its order of transfer to Merced County. As we read the record, the vacation order left standing that part of the court\u2019s announced order lifting the stay. Under section 12022.1, subdivision (d) the lower court was required to lift the stay and the record sufficiently manifests the court\u2019s intention to comply with the statutory mandate. Therefore, remand is unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1548-7\">There are, though, two matters as to which the abstract of judgment is deficient. First, the abstract omits any reference to the order lifting the stay. Second, the abstract fails to reflect that the term imposed in Fresno County is subordinate to the Merced sentence, and that the two-year sentence imposed in Fresno is subject to the limitations of section 1170.1, subdivision (a); i.e., only one-third (eight months) of that term should be served consecutive to the determinate sentence imposed by the Merced court. We will direct the court below to amend the abstract accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b1549-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1851\">*1851</page-number>II. <em>Presentence </em>credits.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1549-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b1549-6\">The judgment is affirmed. The clerk of the superior court is directed to issue an amended abstract of judgment which (1) reflects the court\u2019s order lifting the stay previously ordered by the Merced County Superior Court; (2) reflects that the sentence imposed on the instant offense is subject to the limitations of section 1170.1, subdivision (a); and (3) reflects that the number of presentence custody credits awarded to appellant is 27 days, consisting of 19 days of actual local time and 8 days of local conduct credits.
