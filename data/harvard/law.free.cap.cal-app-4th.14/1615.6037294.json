While at her home he met her son, Kevin White. After a few hours they decided to leave the house and go bowling or play video games. On the way they stopped at the apartment of White\u2019s sister, Sylvia. In the hallway of her apartment, they met defendant, Sylvia\u2019s neighbor. Reilly did not know defendant. The three men spent one-half hour in Sylvia\u2019s apartment and then decided to go to Santa Monica Pier to play video games.</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-11\">After playing video games at the pier, they went to Venice Beach, parked near the boardwalk and walked toward rocks which entered the ocean, like a jetty. White walked ahead while defendant and Reilly followed, walking side by side. When they arrived at the rocky area, defendant told Reilly to look to his left, and when he did so, defendant grabbed him from behind and started to stab him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-12\">Reilly screamed, \u201cHelp. He\u2019s got a knife. He\u2019s trying to kill me.\u201d White, who was then 10 to 15 feet ahead, turned around. Defendant stabbed Reilly in the chest, under his arm and on his cheek. Reilly fell to the ground and defendant stabbed him in the back of his head. White ran to defendant, grabbed him, and talked him out of continuing his attack on Reilly. He noticed that defendant looked \u201cweird\u201d and \u201cspaced-out.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-13\">White heard defendant say, \u201cHe\u2019s looking bad. He\u2019s looking bad. I might as well ice him now.\u201d White responded, \u201cMan, this is a friend. This is my mom\u2019s friend. I can\u2019t let you do this to him.\u201d When White asked defendant why he attacked Reilly, defendant said Reilly reminded him of someone who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1620\">*1620</page-number>raped his sister a long time ago. Defendant disappeared behind a wall and reemerged wearing different clothing. White took Reilly back to his car and drove him to UCLA Medical Center where he remained for seven days. White called the police from the hospital and told them where they could find defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1392-4\">Defendant was arrested the following day. He was with Stephanie Hunter. When defendant was informed that he was under arrest for assault with a deadly weapon the night before, Hunter overheard and said that was impossible because defendant had been with her at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b1392-5\"><em>Defense </em>Case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1392-6\">Hunter testified that she lived with defendant. The day before his arrest, defendant used drugs during the afternoon and evening hours. Later that evening, White and Reilly came to her apartment and then left with defendant. When defendant left he was \u201cmumbling\u201d and acting \u201cweird.\u201d Defendant came home at midnight; he was crying and acting \u201cweird.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1392-7\">Dr. Kaushal Sharma, a forensic psychiatrist, testified that he had spoken with defendant about his use of drugs. He testified about the effects of cocaine and a drug called \u201cice.\u201d He said those drugs can make a person behave aggressively and do things he might not do if not under the influence of the drug.</p>\n<p id=\"b1392-8\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1392-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1392-10\">\n<em>The trial court did not err in refusing to give CAUIC Nos. 4.30 and 4.31</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1392-11\">Defendant contends the court erred in refusing his request to instruct the jury with CALJIC Nos. 4.30<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and 4.31.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1392-12\">CALJIC No. 4.30 serves to instruct a jury that a defendant who is \u201cunconscious\u201d at the time of the commission of the crime cannot be found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1621\">*1621</page-number>guilty of the crime. CALJIC No. 4.31 sets forth a presumption of consciousness. These instructions state the fundamental principle expressed in Penal Code<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> section 26, subdivision Four (formerly subd. Five),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> that a defendant cannot be adjudged guilty of any crime with which he is charged if he committed the act while unconscious. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Wilson </em>(1967) 66 Cal.2d 749, 761 [427 P.2d 820]; 1 Witkin &amp; Epstein, Cal. Criminal Law (2d ed. 1988) Defenses, \u00a7\u00a7 214, 215, pp. 246-249.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1393-5\">Unconsciousness caused by voluntary intoxication is, however, governed by section 22,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> not section 26. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Conley </em>(1966) 64 Cal.2d 310, 323-324 [49 Cal.Rptr. 815, 411 P.2d 911].) Although voluntary intoxication may at times amount to unconsciousness, it cannot give a complete defense under section 26, subdivision Four; it can only negate specific intent under section 22. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Baker </em>(1954) 42 Cal.2d 550, 575 [268 P.2d 705]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Alexander </em>(1960) 182 Cal.App.2d 281, 289-290 [6 Cal.Rptr. 153]; 1 Witkin &amp; Epstein, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7217, pp. 250-251, and see \u00a7\u00a7212, 213, pp. 243-246.) Section 22 has been incorporated into CALJIC Nos. 4.20, 4.21, and 4.22.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> These instructions were properly read to the jury in light of the evidence that defendant was voluntarily intoxicated with narcotics at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1622\">*1622</page-number>time of the incident. Therefore, the trial court did not err in refusing to instruct the jury with CALJIC Nos. 4.30 and 4.31.</p>\n<p id=\"b1394-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1394-5\">\n<em>The trial court had no sua sponte duty to instruct the jury on attempted</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1394-6\">\n<em>voluntary manslaughter.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1394-7\">Defendant\u2019s contention the trial court had a sua sponte duty to instruct the jury on attempted voluntary manslaughter is likewise unmeritorious.</p>\n<p id=\"b1394-8\">Defendant maintains that since the \u201centire defense\u201d hinged on defendant\u2019s lack of the requisite intent to kill for attempted murder, \u201cthe trial court [had] a duty under <em>[People </em>v.] <em>Saille </em>[(1991) 54 Cal.3d 1103 (2 Cal.Rptr.2d 364, 820 P.2d 588)] to instruct as to the possibility that [defendant\u2019s] voluntary intoxication negated the intent to kill which would <em>reduce the matter to a voluntary manslaughter, </em>if the jury so found.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1394-9\">Defendant acknowledges that <em>People </em>v. <em>Saille </em>(1991) 54 Cal.3d 1103 [2 Cal.Rptr.2d 364, 820 P.2d 588] holds the trial court does not have a sua sponte duty to instruct on attempted voluntary manslaughter when there is evidence of a defendant\u2019s voluntary intoxication, but asserts that <em>Saille </em>\u201cdoes not apply to this case\u201d because it does not specifically address the question how voluntary intoxication relates to the mental state \u201cintent to kill.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1394-10\">We disagree with defendant\u2019s analysis of <em>Saille </em>and find, contrary to defendant\u2019s assertions, the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in that case is directly relevant to the issues defendant raises on this appeal. In <em>Saille, </em>the court held that abolition of the diminished capacity defense eliminated the concept of \u201c \u2018diminished capacity voluntary manslaughter\u2019 (nonstatutory manslaughter)\u201d as a defense, explaining that now, when an intentional killing is shown, malice aforethought is established. (54 Cal.3d at p. 1114.)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> However, the court held a defendant is still free to show that, because of voluntary intoxication, the intent to kill was not in fact formed. (54 Cal.3d at pp. 1116-1117.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1394-11\">The <em>Saille </em>court explained: \u201c[U]nder the law relating to mental capacity as it exists today, it makes more sense to place on the defendant the duty to request an instruction which relates the evidence of his intoxication to an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1623\">*1623</page-number>element of a crime, such as premeditation and deliberation. This is so because the defendant\u2019s evidence of intoxication can no longer be proffered as a defense to a crime but rather is proffered in an attempt to raise a doubt on an <em>element of a crime </em>which the prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt. In such a case the defendant is attempting to relate his evidence of intoxication to an element of the crime. Accordingly, he may seek a \u2018pinpoint\u2019 instruction that must be requested by him [citation], but such a pinpoint instruction does not involve a \u2018general principle of law\u2019 as that term is used in the cases that have imposed a sua sponte duty of instruction on the trial court. The court did not err, therefore, in failing to instruct sua sponte.\u201d (54 Cal.3d at p. 1120, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1395-5\">Most of the foregoing passage from <em>Saille </em>is quoted with approval in an attempted murder case, <em>People </em>v. <em>Morales </em>(1992) 5 Cal.App.4th 917, 927 [7 Cal.Rptr.2d 358]. In <em>Morales, </em>the court specifically held the trial court had no sua sponte duty to instruct on attempted voluntary manslaughter and that, if there was sufficient evidence of intoxication to support an instruction on the absence of intent to kill due to voluntary intoxication, the obligation was on the defendant to request it. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1395-6\">Here, defendant\u2019s counsel did request \u201cpinpoint\u201d instructions relating defendant\u2019s voluntary intoxication to the intent to kill element of attempted murder and, as we discussed above, those instructions, CALJIC Nos. 4.21 and 4.22 (see fn. 7, <em>ante), </em>were read to the jury. Thereafter, defendant\u2019s counsel argued to the jury his theory of the case, that defendant did not have the intent to kill for attempted murder, as charged in count 1, because his voluntary intoxication negated that specific intent and, therefore, he could only be guilty of the general intent crime of assault, as charged in count 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b1395-7\">Under both <em>Saille </em>and <em>Morales, </em>the trial court had no sua sponte duty to instruct the jury on the lesser crime of attempted voluntary manslaughter. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in failing to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1395-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1395-9\">\n<em>Defendant was not denied effective assistance of counsel.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1395-10\">Defendant asserts that if the court had no sua sponte duty to instruct the jury on attempted voluntary manslaughter, then defendant\u2019s counsel should have requested those instructions and his failure to do so demonstrates defendant was denied effective assistance of counsel. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1395-11\">A convicted defendant\u2019s claim that counsel\u2019s assistance was so defective as to require reversal of his conviction has two components. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1624\">*1624</page-number><em>(People </em>v. <em>Ledesma </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 171, 216 [233 Cal.Rptr. 404, 729 P.2d 839].) First, the criminal defendant must show his counsel\u2019s performance was deficient. <em>(Ibid.; People </em>v. <em>Pope </em>(1979) 23 Cal.3d 412, 425 [152 Cal.Rptr. 732, 590 P.2d 859, 2 A.L.R.4th 1].) In addition, the defendant must establish prejudice before he can obtain relief on an ineffective-assistance claim. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ledesma, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d at p. 217.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1396-4\">In determining whether defense counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, a court must exercise deferential scrutiny. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ledesma, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d at p. 216.) The first and fundamental reason for such deference involves the danger of second-guessing trial counsel. <em>(Ibid.) </em>That is so, because the means of providing effective assistance are many and, as a consequence, counsel has wide discretion in choosing which means to use. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Further, systematic \u201csecond guessing\u201d by appellate courts might have adverse consequences on the quality of legal representation provided to criminal defendants and on the functioning of the criminal justice system itself. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1396-5\">Therefore, if the record shows trial counsel\u2019s challenged acts or omissions resulted from an informed tactical choice within a range of reasonable competence, the conviction must be affirmed. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Pope, supra, </em>23 Cal.3d at p. 425.) In contrast, where the record reveals that counsel has failed to research the law or investigate the facts in the manner of a reasonably diligent and conscientious advocate, and that defendant was prejudiced as a result, the conviction should be reversed on the ground of deprivation of adequate assistance of counsel. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 425-426.) Of course, the burden of proving a claim of inadequate assistance at trial is on the appellant. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 425.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1396-6\">On this record, it appears counsel\u2019s decision, to attempt to negate the specific intent to kill element of attempted murder and argue defendant could then only be guilty of assault, was an informed one among his tactical alternatives. He did not have the option to argue before the jury for a reduction of the offense to attempted voluntary manslaughter because of defendant\u2019s voluntary ingestion of drugs, which is the premise on which defendant bases his arguments on appeal. That is true because had counsel been successful in negating the intent to kill element necessary for the jury to find attempted murder, the jury likewise could not have found the elements of attempted voluntary manslaughter, which also requires an intent to kill.</p>\n<p id=\"b1396-7\">As we discussed, <em>ante, </em>in <em>Saille, </em>the court explained that, when the diminished capacity defense was abolished, the concept of \u201c \u2018diminished <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1625\">*1625</page-number>capacity voluntary manslaughter\u2019 (nonstatutory manslaughter)\u201d as a defense was eliminated (54 Cal.3d at p. 1114) and, now, when the intent to kill is shown, malice is also established <em>(ibid.). </em>Thus, the traditional distinction between murder and voluntary manslaughter\u2014the absence of malice\u2014is no longer viable when the issue is whether the voluntary ingestion of drugs negated the defendant\u2019s intent to kill and, therefore, malice. Thus, in the instant case, evidence of defendant\u2019s voluntary intoxication did not support a request for instructions to the jury on attempted voluntary manslaughter.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1397-5\">Manslaughter is the unlawful killing of a human being without malice; it is voluntary manslaughter when the killing is \u201cupon a sudden quarrel or heat of passion.\u201d (\u00a7 192, subd. (a); CALJIC No. 8.40 (1989 rev.); <em>People </em>v. <em>Saille, supra, </em>54 Cal.3d at p. 1114.) Thus, \u201c[sjection 192 . . . negates malice when the intentional killing results from a sudden quarrel or heat of passion induced by adequate provocation.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Saille, supra, </em>54 Cal.3d at p. 1114.) If there is no adequate provocation, or the passion has had time to subside, the killing will not be reduced from murder to manslaughter. (1 Witkin &amp; Epstein, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 491, pp. 555-556; CALJIC Nos. 8.42, 8.43.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1397-6\">In this case, as in <em>People </em>v. <em>Daniels </em>(1991) 52 Cal.3d 815, 868 [277 Cal.Rptr. 122, 802 P.2d 906], there was no evidence of provocation by Reilly and no evidence that defendant was \u201cin the \u2018heat of passion\u2019 \u201d when he attacked Reilly. That defendant was bent on revenge for his sister\u2019s long-ago rape was insufficient to warrant manslaughter instructions. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 868.) The rule is that, if sufficient time has elapsed for the passions of an ordinarily reasonable person to cool, the killing is murder, not manslaughter. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Moreover, the record is barren of evidence that defendant\u2019s acts were excusable or justifiable or that defendant honestly but unreasonably believed he was acting in self-defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b1397-7\">Here, defense counsel\u2019s theory of the case was that there was an absence of the intent to kill and thus the only crime of which defendant could be convicted was assault. Based on the record before this court, we cannot say that counsel\u2019s choice of that theory was a tactical decision which would not be made by a diligent, ordinarily prudent lawyer. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Pope, supra, </em>23 Cal.3d at p. 424.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1397-8\">To the contrary, trial counsel conducted himself in a manner to be expected of a reasonably competent attorney acting as a diligent advocate and his challenged acts or omissions did not result in the withdrawal from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1626\">*1626</page-number>defendant of a potentially meritorious defense. (23 Cal.3d at p. 425.) Therefore, since counsel\u2019s performance was not deficient, defendant has failed to meet his burden to establish his claim of inadequate trial counsel. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1398-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1398-5\">Defendant\u2019s Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus*</p>\n<p id=\"b1398-6\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b1398-7\">The judgment on appeal is affirmed in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b1398-8\">\n<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1398-9\">Woods (A.
