J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ako\">Defendant Christopher James McGuire pleaded guilty to transporting methamphetamine (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11379), possessing methamphetamine for sale (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11378), being under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>influence of a controlled substance (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11550, subd. (a)), driving a vehicle under the influence of a drug (Veh. Code, \u00a7 23152, subd. (a)), and giving false information to a peace officer (Pen. Code, \u00a7 148.9, subd. (a)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> McGuire also admitted a prior conviction for violating Health and Safety Code section 11378. The court sentenced McGuire to 16 months in prison. McGuire appeals, contending the court erred in determining it lacked authority to place him on probation. McGuire also contends the court erred in entering convictions for both driving under the influence and the assertedly necessarily included offense of being under the influence. McGuire further contends the court violated section 654 in imposing sentence for both those convictions. We affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">The People appeal an order under section 1272, subdivision 3, granting McGuire bail on appeal. Asserting there was no substantial legal question on the issue whether the court had authority to strike the prior conviction finding and grant McGuire probation, the People contend the superior court abused its discretion in granting McGuire bail. We affirm the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b617-8\">On the evening of July 29, 1991, a highway patrol officer stopped McGuire for driving at excessive speed and making numerous lane changes. McGuire gave the officer a false name and age. McGuire appeared to be under the influence of a controlled substance. A search of McGuire\u2019s car revealed 18.3 grams of methamphetamine. Also found were an active pager (containing some methamphetamine), a digital scale, pay-and-owe sheets, a voice mail phone card, and various phone numbers.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b617-10\">Superior Court Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b617-11\">In January 1992 the People filed an amended information charging five counts and alleging McGuire had a prior conviction for violating Health and Safety Code section 11378 within the meaning of section 1203.07, subdivision (a)(ll).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> McGuire pleaded guilty to all five counts and admitted the prior conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>At sentencing, the court stated it wanted to grant McGuire probation but was precluded from doing so by section 1203.07, subdivision (a)(ll).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court then denied McGuire probation and sentenced him to prison for a total of 16 months.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> McGuire appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">Later the court granted McGuire bail on appeal. The People appeal the order granting bail.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">McGuire\u2019s Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b618-8\">\n<em>Court Lacked Authority to Place McGuire on Probation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b618-9\">McGuire contends the superior court erred in determining section 1203.07, subdivision (a)(ll), eliminated its section 1385 discretion to strike the prior conviction finding and grant him probation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Citing <em>People </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1981) 30 Cal.3d 470 [179 Cal.Rptr. 443, 637 P.2d 1029] and <em>People </em>v. <em>Fritz </em>(1985) 40 Cal.3d 227 [219 Cal.Rptr. 460, 707 P.2d 833], McGuire contends the court had power under section 1385 to strike the finding of his prior conviction because the Legislature assertedly did not intend section 1203.07, subdivision (a)(ll), to negate such power.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> McGuire asserts the legislative history of section 1203.07, subdivision (a)(ll), demonstrates the Legislature intended that courts would retain section 1385 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>authority because the Legislature assertedly considered and rejected clear language which would have eliminated such authority.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> McGuire also notes the Legislature did not amend section 1385 to preclude its application to strike a prior conviction finding with respect to section 1203.07, subdivision (a)(ll). However, we conclude in enacting section 1203.07, subdivision (a)(ll), the Legislature intended to eliminate the court\u2019s discretion under 1385 to strike a prior conviction finding for the purpose of rendering a defendant eligible for probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">Case law is not helpful to McGuire\u2019s position. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Pacheco </em>(1985) 176 Cal.App.3d 100 [221 Cal.Rptr. 369]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Ibarra </em>(1980) 114 Cal.App.3d 60 [170 Cal.Rptr. 440]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Cooper </em>(1979) 95 Cal.App.3d 844 [157 Cal.Rptr. 348].) In <em>People </em>v. <em>Cooper, supra, </em>the appellate court held the trial court correctly considered itself bound by section 1203.07 to deny probation. (95 Cal.App.3d at p. 854.) Citing <em>People </em>v. <em>Tanner </em>(1979) 24 Cal.3d 514 [156 Cal.Rptr. 450, 596 P.2d 328], which held section 1203.06 prohibited the court from exercising its section 1385 discretion to strike an allegation precluding probation, the appellate court in <em>Cooper </em>stated: \u201cTry as we might, we are unable to distinguish the mandatory language of Penal Code section 1203.06 from the identical language in section 1203.07.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Cooper, supra, </em>95 Cal.App.3d at p. 854.)</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Ibarra, supra, </em>114 Cal.App.3d 60, the appellate court stated: \u201cThe People are correct in their contention that the trial court exceeded its power when it struck the section 1203.07 allegation. The mandatory language of section 1203.07 is identical to that of section 1203.06 considered in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number><em>People </em>v. <em>Tanner </em>(1979) 24 Cal.3d 514 [citation]. Under the <em>Tanner </em>reasoning the trial court had no discretion to strike the one-half ounce allegation in order to make defendant eligible for probation. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Cooper </em>(1979) 95 Cal.App.3d 844, 854 [157 Cal.Rptr. 348].)\u201d <em>(Id. </em>atpp. 65-66, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">McGuire discounts <em>People </em>v. <em>Cooper, supra, </em>95 Cal.App.3d 844, and <em>People </em>v. <em>Ibarra, supra, </em>114 Cal.App.3d 60, because those cases did not analyze legislative history. However, in <em>People </em>v. <em>Pacheco, supra, </em>176 Cal.App.3d 100, the appellate court conducted a review of various documents demonstrating section 1203.07\u2019s legislative history and concluded the Legislature \u201cclearly intended\u201d the statutory language to be mandatory. (176 Cal.App.3d at pp. 102-104.) The appellate court stated: \u201cHaving examined these documents we conclude that section 1203.07 was intended to eliminate a trial court\u2019s section 1385 discretion to strike allegations or findings of a defendant\u2019s ineligibility for probation.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 103.) We find <em>Pacheco </em>persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">The Legislature \u201cis deemed to be aware of statutes and judicial decisions already in existence, and to have enacted or amended a statute in light thereof. [Citation.] Where a statute is framed in language of an earlier enactment on the same or an analogous subject, and that enactment has been judicially construed, the Legislature is presumed to have adopted that construction. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Harrison </em>(1989) 48 Cal.3d 321, 329 [256 Cal.Rptr. 401, 768 P.2d 1078].)  Thus, in adding subparagraph (11) to section 1203.07, subdivision (a), in 1989, the Legislature is deemed to have been aware of the case <em>law\u2014People </em>v. <em>Pacheco, supra, </em>176 Cal.App.3d 100; <em>People </em>v. <em>Ibarra, supra, </em>114 Cal.App.3d 60; and <em>People </em>v. <em>Cooper, supra, </em>95 Cal.App.3d 844\u2014holding section 1203.07 prohibited courts from striking prior conviction findings for purposes of granting probation. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Harrison, supra, </em>at p. 329.) The Legislature is also deemed to have adopted that judicial construction of section 1203.07. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Harrison supra, </em>at p. 329.) Hence, we conclude the Legislature intended section 1203.07, subdivision (a)(ll), to eliminate the trial court\u2019s section 1385 discretion to strike a prior conviction finding to render a defendant eligible for probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">Further, McGuire\u2019s citation to the abandoned proposed amendment to Health and Safety Code section 11370 misses the point. The legislative history shows that instead of amending Health and Safety Code section 11370 the Legislature chose to add another subdivision to section 1203.07, a statute already construed to prohibit exercise of section 1385 discretion. An analysis of AB 1667 prepared for the Senate Committee on Judiciary stated: \u201cExisting law (Penal Code Sec. 1203.07) has been construed to prohibit a court from striking the allegation that the prior offense occurred in order to overcome the prohibition of probation. <em>People </em>v. <em>Ibarra </em>(1980) 114 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>Cal.App.3d 60, 170 Cal.Rptr.440. <em>People </em>v. <em>Pacheco </em>(1985) 176 Cal.App.3d 100, 221 Cal.Rptr.369. Therefore, the prohibition of probation under the bill is likely to be construed as <em>absolute </em>with the court having <em>no discretion\u201d </em>(Italics in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">The legislative history also indicates the original purpose of the statutory change was to overcome our holding in <em>People </em>v. <em>Ruby, supra, </em>204 Cal.App.3d 462. In <em>Ruby </em>the defendant was convicted of possessing a controlled substance (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11350, subd. (a)) with a prior possession conviction within the meaning of Health and Safety Code section 11370, subdivision (a). We concluded the trial court erred in believing it lacked discretion to strike the prior conviction allegation. (204 Cal.App.3d at p. 464.) We stated \u201cthere [was] no express legislative intent either in the statutory language or its legislative history to preclude the exercise of judicial discretion under Penal Code section 1385.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 465.) An analysis of AB 1667 prepared for the Assembly Committee on Public Safety stated AB 1667\u2019s purpose was \u201cto re-implement the statutes that prevent serious, repeat drug offenders from being eligible for probation.\u201d In commenting on the need for the bill, the analysis stated: \u201cThe Court of Appeal has held in <em>People </em>v. <em>Ruby </em>(1988) 204 Cal.App.3d 462 [251 Cal.Rptr. 339] that the <em>Cortez [In re Cortez </em>(1971) 6 Cal.3d 78 (98 Cal.Rptr. 307, 490 P.2d 819)] rationale also is applicable to the current statute [Health &amp; Saf. Code \u00a7 11370]. Review has been denied by the California Supreme Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">In sum, the superior court properly determined section 1203.07, subdivision (a) (11), eliminated its discretion under section 1385 to strike the prior conviction finding and place McGuire on probation.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b621-8\">\n<em>McGuire Was Properly Convicted of Both Being Under the Influence and Driving Under the Influence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b621-9\">McGuire pleaded guilty to being under the influence of a controlled substance (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11550, subd. (a)) and driving a vehicle under the influence of a drug (Veh. Code, \u00a7 23152, subd. (a)).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Asserting both crimes were based upon his use of methamphetamine, McGuire contends the court could not properly enter convictions on both counts. McGuire <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>contends his being under the influence of methamphetamine was a necessarily included lesser offense of driving under the influence of methamphetamine and thus his conviction for that lesser offense should be reversed. However, we find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">\u201cAn offense is necessarily included within a charged offense \u2018if under the statutory definition of the charged offense it cannot be committed without committing the lesser offense, or if the charging allegations of the accusatory pleading include language describing the offense in such a way that if committed as specified the lesser offense is necessarily committed.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Toro </em>(1989) 47 Cal.3d 966, 972 [254 Cal.Rptr. 811, 766 P.2d 577].)  McGuire acknowledges under the statutory language a violation of Vehicle Code section 23152, subdivision (a), may occur without violating Health and Safety Code section 11550. McGuire also acknowledges the existence of case law not helpful to his position. <em>(Gilbert </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1977) 73 Cal.App.3d 723 [140 Cal.Rptr. 897]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Davalos </em>(1987) 192 Cal.App.3d Supp. 10, 13 [238 Cal.Rptr. 50].) Further, the language of the amended information does not describe the Vehicle Code offense in such a way that if committed as alleged the Health and Safety Code offense was necessarily committed. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Toro, supra, </em>47 Cal.3d at p. 972.)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> However, citing evidence from the preliminary hearing, McGuire contends under the facts here both violations involved the same methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">McGuire\u2019s written plea indicated he pleaded guilty to the \u201cface\u201d of the amended information and admitted being \u201cunder the influence and driving under the influence.\u201d McGuire\u2019s appellate attack on his conviction on the assertedly necessarily included lesser offense amounts to an impermissible attack on the validity of his plea because he has not complied with section 1237.5\u2019s requirements of filing a written statement under oath \u201cshowing reasonable constitutional, jurisdictional, or other grounds going to the legality of the proceedings\u201d and obtaining from the trial court a certificate of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>probable cause for his appeal. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Zamora </em>(1991) 230 Cal.App.3d 1627, 1633 [282 Cal.Rptr. 100].)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">Further, in any event, in pleading guilty McGuire admitted the factual underpinnings of his convictions.  Thus, his contention the record does not demonstrate the existence of an adequate factual basis for his guilty pleas must fail. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Turner </em>(1985) 171 Cal.App.3d 116, 125 [214 Cal.Rptr. 572]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Brown </em>(1971) 18 Cal.App.3d 1052, 1055 [96 Cal.Rptr. 476],)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">\n<em>No Sentencing Error</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">Section 654 provides in relevant part: \u201cAn act or omission which is made punishable in different ways by different provisions of this code may be punished under either of such provisions, but in no case can it be punished under more than one . . . .\u201d McGuire contends the court violated section 654 by imposing sentences both for driving under the influence and being under the influence. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-9\">\u201c[I]t is well settled that section 654 applies not only where there was but one act in the ordinary sense, but also where there was a course of conduct which violated more than one statute but nevertheless constituted an indivisible transaction. [Citation.] Whether a course of conduct is indivisible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>depends upon the intent and objective of the actor. [Citation.] If all the offenses were incident to one objective, the defendant may be punished for any one of such offenses but not for more than one. [Citation.]\" <em>(People </em>v. <em>Perez </em>(1979) 23 Cal.3d 545, 551 [153 Cal.Rptr. 40, 591 P.2d 63].) However, where, as here, the defendant \u201c\u2018entertained multiple criminal objectives which were independent of and not merely incidental to each other, he may be punished for the independent violations committed in pursuit of each objective even though the violations were parts of an otherwise indivisible course of conduct.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Butler </em>(1986) 184 Cal.App.3d 469, 472-473 [229 Cal.Rptr. 103].) \u201cWhether the defendant held \u2018multiple criminal objectives is primarily a question of fact for the trial court, whose finding will be upheld on appeal if there is any substantial evidence to support it.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Galvan </em>(1986) 187 Cal.App.3d 1205, 1218 [232 Cal.Rptr. 410].) We must \u201cview the evidence in a light most favorable to the respondent and presume in support of the order the existence of every fact the trier could reasonably deduce from the evidence. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Holly </em>(1976) 62 Cal.App.3d 797, 803 [133 Cal.Rptr. 331].)</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\"><em>People </em>v. <em>Davalos, supra, </em>192 Cal.App.3d Supp. 10, is instructive. In <em>Davalos </em>the jury convicted the defendant of driving while under the influence of phencyclidine (PCP) (Veh. Code, \u00a7 23152, subd. (a)) and using or being under the influence of a controlled substance (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11550, subd. (b)). The trial court imposed a separate sentence for each offense. In affirming the judgment, the appellate department of the superior court held \u201ceach charge was a separate punishable offense and did not constitute a single course of conduct for which multiple punishment was improper.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. Supp. 12.) The court stated the defendant was \u201cunable to isolate the single criminal objective essential to defendant\u2019s analysis. [Citation.] He does not contend that he ingested PCP with the objective of driving under the influence or that he drove with the objective of being under the influence of PCP.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. Supp. 13.) The court also noted \u201can examination of the purposes for the enactment of section 11550 and section 23152 shows that the goals of each differ, and that punishment for only one offense may not satisfy these goals. The object of section 11550, which prohibits using or being under the influence of a controlled substance, is to protect the individual by proscribing the use which may be an activating part of the process of drug abuse or addiction. [Citation.] The object of section 23152 is to protect members of the public who use the highways from those who have impaired their ability to drive as the result of substance use. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. Supp. 14.) The court concluded: \u201cWhen defendant ingested the PCP, he was in violation of section 11550 prohibiting the use of a controlled substance. Once he was under the influence of the PCP, as defined by the Vehicle Code, and proceeded to drive his car, he committed an additional separate and distinct offense for which he was subject to further punishment.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>The evidence reasonably supports a finding of a divisible course of conduct based upon McGuire\u2019s intent and objective. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Galvan, supra, </em>187 Cal.App.3d at p. 1218; <em>People </em>v. <em>Butler, supra, </em>184 Cal.App.3d at pp. 473-474; <em>People </em>v. <em>Holly, supra, </em>62 Cal.App.3d at p. 803.) McGuire told the probation officer he snorted one line of methamphetamine about three hours before being stopped by the highway patrol officer. Thus, when McGuire ingested methamphetamine, he violated Health and Safety Code section 11550, subdivision (a), prohibiting being under the influence of a controlled substance. Once McGuire was under the influence of methamphetamine and later proceeded to drive his car, he committed an additional separate and distinct offense for which further punishment was proper. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Davalos, supra, </em>192 Cal.App.3d Supp. 10 at p. Supp. 14.)</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">In sum, the trial court did not err in sentencing McGuire for both being under the influence and driving under the influence.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">The People\u2019s Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b625-8\">The superior court granted McGuire bail on appeal under section 1272, subdivision 3.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The court found by clear and convincing evidence McGuire was not likely to flee. (\u00a7 1272.1, subd. (a).) The court also found McGuire did not pose a danger to the community or to the safety of others under the circumstances of his release on bail. (\u00a7 1272.1, subd. (b).) The court further found McGuire\u2019s appeal raised a substantial legal question and was not for the purpose of delay. (\u00a7 1272.1, subd. (c).)</p>\n<p id=\"b625-9\">Asserting there was no substantial legal question on the issue whether section 1203.07, subdivision (a)(ll), eliminated the court\u2019s power to strike the prior conviction finding and place McGuire on probation, the People contend the superior court abused its discretion in granting him bail pending appeal. We affirm the order granting bail.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-10\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b625-11\">\n<em>Appealability</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b625-12\">In March 1992 we summarily denied the People\u2019s petition for an extraordinary writ arising from the order granting McGuire bail on appeal. <em>(People </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>v. <em>Superior Court (McGuire) </em>(Mar. 25, 1992) D016352 [nonpub. opn.].) The People then filed notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">The People contend their appeal is authorized under section 1238, subdivision (a)(5). That statute permits the People to appeal \u201c[a]n order made after judgment, affecting the substantial rights of the people.\u201d <em>{Ibid.) </em>The People assert the order granting McGuire bail pending appeal substantially affects their right to be secure from the dangers of convicted felons released into society. We conclude the People may properly appeal the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">Preliminarily, we note the statutory scheme contemplates review of an order granting bail pending appeal. Section 1272.1 provides in relevant part: \u201cIn making its decision on whether to grant defendants\u2019 motions for bail under subdivision (3) of Section 1272, the court shall include a brief statement of reasons in support of an order granting or denying a motion for bail on appeal. The statement need only include the basis for the order with sufficient specificity to permit meaningful review.\u201d Further, rule 32(b) provides: \u201cAn application to the reviewing court for bail or to reduce bail on an appeal pending therein shall be made on such notice to the district attorney and the Attorney General as the court may determine, and shall include a showing that proper application for bail or a reduction of bail was made to the superior court and that such court unjustifiably denied the application.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">Review by extraordinary writ of an order granting bail pending appeal is available and most efficacious. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Ruiz) </em>(1986) 187 Cal.App.3d 686, 688 [234 Cal.Rptr. 214].) We also conclude the People may appeal an order granting bail pending appeal even though in most cases such remedy may be inadequate due to delay.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">\u201c \u2018The Legislature has determined that except under certain limited circumstances the People shall have no right of appeal in criminal cases\u2019 [Citation.] Those circumstances are enumerated in section 1238.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Drake </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 749, 754 [139 Cal.Rptr. 720, 566 P.2d 622].) \u201c[T]he courts are precluded from so interpreting section 1238 as to expand the People\u2019s right of appeal into areas other than those clearly specified by the Legislature.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gaines </em>(1980) 112 Cal.App.3d 508, 512 [169 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>Cal.Rptr. 381].) However, we are of the opinion the People\u2019s appeal here is properly before us under section 1238, subdivision (a)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">The issue is whether the order granting McGuire bail pending appeal affects \u201cthe substantial rights of the people.\u201d (\u00a7 1238, subd. (a)(5).) In <em>People </em>v. <em>Garcia </em>(1931) 120 Cal.App. Supp. 767 [7 P.2d 401], the court stated in order to affect the People\u2019s substantial rights an order \u201cmust in some way affect the judgment or its enforcement or hamper the further prosecution of the particular proceeding in which it is made. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. Supp. 770.)<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">Various types of orders after judgment have been determined to be appealable by the People under section 1238, subdivision (a)(5), as affecting their substantial rights. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Perez, supra, </em>23 Cal.3d at p. 549, fn. 2, order staying execution of sentence; <em>People </em>v. <em>Warner </em>(1978) 20 Cal.3d 678, 682, fn. 1 [143 Cal.Rptr. 885, 574 P.2d 1237], order suspending execution of sentence and granting probation; <em>People </em>v. <em>Gilbert </em>(1944) 25 Cal.2d 422, 444 [154 P.2d 657], order modifying judgments of death after affirmance of those judgments on appeal; <em>People </em>v. <em>Minjarez </em>(1980) 102 Cal.App.3d 309, 312 [162 Cal.Rptr. 292], order granting custody credits; <em>Daudert </em>v. <em>People </em>(1979) 94 Cal.App.3d 580, 585 [156 Cal.Rptr. 640], order denying the People\u2019s motion to vacate an order granting a certificate of rehabilitation; <em>People </em>v. <em>Holly, supra, </em>62 Cal.App.3d at pp. 801-802, order implementing \u00a7 654\u2019s prohibition against multiple punishment; and <em>People </em>v. <em>Maggio </em>(1929) 96 Cal.App. 409, 410 [274 P. 611], order modifying a judgment after affirmance of judgment on appeal.) In <em>People </em>v. <em>Maggio, supra, </em>the appellate court stated: \u201cThe People have a right to rely upon the finality of judgments and to know when a judgment has become final that there has been an end to that particular litigation. To say that the rights of plaintiff have not been substantially affected would . . . deal a vital blow to the sanctity of judgments.\u201d (96 Cal.App. at p. 410.)</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">We conclude section 1238, subdivision (a)(5), authorizes the People\u2019s appeal of the order granting McGuire bail pending appeal. The order releasing a convicted felon into society affects enforcement of the judgment and implicates the People\u2019s substantial rights to security. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Garcia, supra, </em>120 Cal.App. at p. Supp. 770.)</p>\n<p id=\"b628-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">\n<em>Order Granting Bail on Appeal Was Not an Abuse of Discretion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">The grant of bail to McGuire was a matter of discretion. (\u00a7 1272, subd. (3); <em>In re Hernandez </em>(1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 1260, 1262 [282 Cal.Rptr. 709].) Section 1272.1 sets forth criteria for the exercise of such discretion.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The People contend the superior court abused its discretion in granting McGuire bail on appeal because there was assertedly no substantial legal question on the issue whether section 1203.07, subdivision (a)(ll), eliminates a trial court\u2019s section 1385 discretion to strike a prior conviction finding for the purpose of placing a defendant on probation. The People assert that issue was decided in <em>People </em>v. <em>Pacheco, supra, </em>176 Cal.App.3d 100. However, we conclude the superior court acted within its discretion in concluding McGuire\u2019s appeal raised a substantial legal question which, if decided in McGuire\u2019s favor, would likely result in reversal of his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">In finding McGuire\u2019s appeal presented a substantial legal question, the superior court noted language in Health and Safety Code section 11370\u2014 \u201cvirtually identical\u201d to section 1203.07\u2019s language\u2014was determined in our decision in <em>People </em>v. <em>Ruby, supra, </em>204 Cal.App.3d 462, not to eliminate a trial court\u2019s discretion under section. 1385 to strike a prior conviction finding for the purpose of granting a defendant probation. The superior court stated: \u201cI would have anticipated or would have thought at the time were I sitting on the <em>Ruby </em>case that the language was so clear that the defendant would be absolutely ineligible. That\u2019s what it says. But our 4th District in <em>Ruby </em>said that\u2019s not the case. [][] They did a legislative analysis and apparently as a part of that appeal the legislative history of that section was such that notwithstanding what it says, the court maintains its discretion under 1385 to strike it.\u201d The superior court also noted although <em>People </em>v. <em>Pacheco, supra, </em>176 Cal.App.3d 100, involved section 1203.07, that case was decided before enactment of the statute\u2019s subdivision (a)(ll).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">In sum, the superior court reasonably concluded in light of this court\u2019s decision in <em>People </em>v. <em>Ruby, supra, </em>204 Cal.App.3d 462, McGuire\u2019s appeal raised a substantial legal issue. (\u00a7 1272.1, subd. (c).) Thus, the superior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>court acted within its discretion in granting McGuire bail on appeal.
