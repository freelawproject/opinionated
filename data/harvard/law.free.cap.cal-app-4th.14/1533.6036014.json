J.</author>\n<p id=\"b1307-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-8\">This is a loan guaranty case. Appellant Tom Y. Lee guaranteed a $5.2 million loan from Cathay Bank to a hotel firm of which he was the corporate secretary and a director. The loan was secured by a Quality Inn in Buena Park. The hotel firm defaulted, and the bank foreclosed in a private sale. There was a deficiency between the amount realized at the sale and the amount owing on the loan, and the bank obtained a summary judgment for the difference against Lee, who appeals.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1307-9\">The dispositive issue before us is whether Lee explicitly waived what might be called the <em>\u201cGradsky </em>defense\u201d to the deficiency action against him.  The <em>Gradsky </em>defense is based on <em>Union Bank </em>v. <em>Gradsky </em>(1968) 265 Cal.App.2d 40 [71 Cal.Rptr. 64], which held that a lender is estopped to recover a deficiency judgment against a guarantor when it elects a particular remedy (nonjudicial foreclosure) which cuts off the guarantor\u2019s subrogation rights against the debtor. Thus, even though California\u2019s antideficiency statute (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 580d) does not protect guarantors directly,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> as a practical matter the <em>\u201cGradsky </em>defense\u201d precludes deficiency judgments against them unless the lender elects the relatively cumbersome remedy of judicial foreclosure.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1307-10\">If there is any language in the continuing guaranty signed by Lee which expressly waived the <em>Gradsky </em>defense, it is in paragraphs 4 and 5 of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1536\">*1536</page-number>that document. Stripped to its readable essentials, the relevant language in paragraph 4 is:</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-4\">\u201cGuarantor authorizes bank at its sole discretion . . .to: . . .(h) exercise any right or remedy it may have with respect to the Credit or any collateral securing the Credit. . . including . . . exercise of power of sale . . . and Guarantor shall be liable to Bank for any deficiency resulting from the exercise by it of any such remedy, even though any rights which Guarantor may have against others might be . . . destroyed.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1308-5\">The core sentence from paragraph 5 reads: \u201cGuarantor waives any defense arising by reason of any disability or other defense of Debtor, its successor or endorser or co-maker or other guarantor or by reason of the cessation from any cause whatsoever of the liability of Debtor or endorser or comaker, or other guarantor.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1309-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1537\">*1537</page-number>Our task is to determine whether either of these provisions constitutes an \u201cexpress\u201d or \u201cexplicit\u201d waiver of Lee\u2019s estoppel defense based upon the bank\u2019s decision to pursue nonjudicial, rather than judicial, foreclosure. (See <em>Union Bank </em>v. <em>Gradsky, supra, </em>265 Cal.App.2d at p. 48.) This is not an easy question.</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-6\">The case law contemplating the explicitness of language which arguably waives the <em>Gradsky </em>defense is rather thin. While a number of cases have dealt in passing with waiver language,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> our research has uncovered only three cases which have actually held whether particular language was sufficiently explicit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-7\"><em>Gradsky </em>is the first of these three cases. There, the court held these words did not constitute an explicit waiver: \u201cI waive . . . any right to require the holder of this within instrument to proceed against the maker or against any other person or to apply any security it may hold or to pursue any other remedy.\u201d (265 Cal.App.2d at pp. 41-42.) The court\u2019s explanation was based on two ideas: (1) any waiver must \u201cspecifically waive the guarantor\u2019s defense based upon an election of remedies which destroys both the guarantor\u2019s subrogation rights and his right to proceed against the principal obligor for reimbursement,\u201d and (2) the court would \u201cnot strain\" to imply a waiver where none was \u201cexplicit.\u201d (265 Cal.App.2d at p. 48.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1538\">*1538</page-number>Next, in <em>Mariners Sav. &amp; Loan Assn. </em>v. <em>Neil, supra, </em>22 Cal.App.3d 232, the court held that language which both stated (1) the guarantors waived \u201cany defense based on Section[] 580 . . and (2) farther waived \u201cany right to require Association to (a) proceed against Borrowers; (b) proceed against or exhaust any security held from Borrowers; or (c) pursue any other remedy in Association\u2019s power whatsoever,\u201d was explicit. Unfortunately, that was all the court said. (See 22 Cal.App.3d at p. 236.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-4\">Finally, in <em>Indusco Management Corp. </em>v. <em>Robertson </em>(1974) 40 Cal.App.3d 456 [114 Cal.Rptr. 47], the guarantor waived \u201call suretyship defenses and defenses in the nature thereof.\u201d (See 40 Cal.App.3d at p. 459.) The court determined that this language could not \u201cfairly be construed to be a specific waiver of the guarantor\u2019s defense.\u201d (See 40 Cal.App.3d at p. 462.) Alas, again it did not elaborate. The most the court did was to footnote its conclusion with a quotation from a treatise? which stated the necessity for a \u201ccreditor\u2019s standard form waiver [to] contain a specific waiver based on the creditor\u2019s creation of a [Code of Civil Procedure section] 580d deficiency bar in favor of the debtor.\u201d (See 40 Cal.App.3d at p. 462, fa. 4.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-5\">We can only glean a little from an analysis of the actual language at issue in <em>Gradsky, Mariners, </em>and <em>Indusco. </em>The language in <em>Gradsky </em>failed to specifically mention any rights under section 580d; the language in <em>Mariners </em>did.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The language in <em>Gradsky </em>failed to specifically inform the would-be guarantor he had subrogation rights that might be destroyed if the lender pursued nonjudicial foreclosure; but neither did the language in <em>Mariners, </em>though at least that language strongly implied the guarantor might actually have a defense based on section 580d. The language in <em>Indusco </em>seems very general indeed, so we can easily understand why it failed to pass muster.</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-6\">In analyzing these cases, however, it is perhaps too easy to stray from the question which must necessarily be the core of whether the <em>Gradsky </em>defense has been waived: what is it, <em>precisely, </em>that the guarantor is being asked to waive? The answer is supplied by <em>Gradsky </em>itself: it is the <em>defense </em>based on estoppel which arises out of the operation of section 580d in the context of a nonjudicial foreclosure. If we keep this basic fact in mind, it becomes clear that it is not enough merely to imply (however strongly or unavoidably) to the guarantor that he or she has a \u201cright\u201d to compel the lender to select a particular remedy (judicial foreclosure) in the event the principal obligor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1539\">*1539</page-number>fails to pay the loan. This does not spell out the true legal consequences of what would otherwise happen if the lender selects another remedy (nonjudicial foreclosure). The guarantor is not told that if the lender selects nonjudicial foreclosure, he or she will have a <em>defense </em>to a deficiency judgment, and it is <em>that defense </em>which the guarantor is now being asked to give up in advance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-5\">Judged on this basis, the language in paragraph 4 of this case falls short of constituting an \u201cexplicit\u201d or \u201cspecific\u201d waiver of the <em>Gradsky </em>defense. While it is true that paragraph 4 tells the guarantor he or she may lose subrogation rights, it does nothing to tell the guarantor that the very fact of the loss of those subrogation rights <em>itself </em>has legal significance\u2014namely that it confers an immunity from a deficiency judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-6\">The closest paragraph 4 comes to such a declaration is the language which states the guarantor \u201cshall be liable to Bank for any deficiency resulting from the exercise by it of any such remedy, even though any rights which Guarantor may have against others might be . . . destroyed.\u201d But again, the problem with these words is that they are insufficiently specific about the <em>precise </em>rights that are being waived. In effect, all they say is: \u201cYou will be liable for a deficiency judgment even if our exercise of one of our remedies destroys your subrogation rights.\u201d To find a waiver of the <em>Gradsky </em>defense here one must go beyond the actual words and imply into them two more ideas, namely: (1) that the destruction of subrogation rights creates a defense to a deficiency judgment, and (2) the guarantor is now waiving that <em>specific </em>defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-7\">The first principles of waiver buttress our conclusion. Waiver is the intentional relinquishment of a <em>known </em>right. <em>(BP Alaska Exploration, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1988) 199 Cal.App.3d 1240, 1252 [245 Cal.Rptr. 682] [erroneous legal concession not waiver because not intentional and knowing].) \u201cThe burden is on the party claiming the waiver to prove it by clear and convincing evidence that \u201cdoes not leave the matter doubtful or uncertain . . . \u201d <em>(Pacific Valley Bank </em>v. <em>Schwenke </em>(1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 134, 145 [234 Cal.Rptr. 298], quoting <em>In re Marriage of Vomacka </em>(1984) 36 Cal.3d 459, 469 [204 Cal.Rptr. 568, 683 P.2d 248].) Waiver requires \u201c \u2018sufficient awareness of the relevant circumstances and likely consequences.\u2019 \u201d <em>(In re Marriage of Perkal </em>(1988) 203 Cal.App.3d 1198, 1203 [250 Cal.Rptr. 296], quoting <em>In re Marriage of Moore </em>(1980) 113 Cal.App.3d 22, 27 [169 Cal.Rptr. 619].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-9\">These principles emphasize actual knowledge and awareness of what is being waived, and require resolution of doubts against waiver.  Here, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1540\">*1540</page-number>the language in paragraph 4 does not provide the reader with any actual awareness of the <em>Gradsky </em>defense (i.e., the legal consequence of the destruction of subrogation rights by nonjudicial foreclosure), and even if the matter is arguable, the doubt should be resolved against waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b1312-4\">This last point raises the more general issue of how courts should approach waivers of the <em>Gradsky </em>defense in guaranty agreements. The average lawyer would naturally suppose that any ambiguities would be construed against the party who selected the language, who normally is the lender.</p>\n<p id=\"b1312-5\">Cathay Bank, however, cites us to two cases <em>(Brunswick Corp. </em>v. <em>Hays </em>(1971) 16 Cal.App.3d 134 [93 Cal.Rptr. 635], and <em>Berg Metals Corp. </em>v. <em>Wilson </em>(1959) 170 Cal.App.2d 559 [339 P.2d 869]) which indicate otherwise. Each of these cases contains a quotation to the effect that ambiguities in guaranty contracts are interpreted against guarantors.</p>\n<p id=\"b1312-6\">The proposition is unsound, at least as applied to waivers of rights inhering in statutory law. <em>Brunswick Corp. </em>v. <em>Hays, supra, </em>16 Cal.App.3d at pages 138-139, quoted <em>Berg Metals Corp. </em>v. <em>Wilson, supra, </em>170 Cal.App.2d at page 571, for the ambiguities-against-the-guarantor rule, which in turn quoted <em>Lean </em>v. <em>Geagan </em>(1912) 20 Cal.App. 260 [128 P. 792], When we turn to <em>Lean, </em>however, we find it provides no authority for its statement,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> which is not surprising given that, taken literally, the statement contradicts one of the most fundamental tenets of contract law (see Civ. Code, \u00a7 1654). What, one might ask, is so special about guaranty contracts that they are exempt from the rule of contra proferentem?</p>\n<p id=\"b1312-7\">The answer is: nothing. <em>Lean </em>involved a situation where the defendant guaranteed repayment of indebtedness for merchandise sold to a third party \u201cprovided the amount due or to become due shall at no time exceed the sum of one thousand dollars.\u201d (20 Cal.App. at p. 261.) The lender extended credit in excess of $1,000, the third party paid less than $100, the lender sued the guarantor and prevailed, and the guarantor was granted a new trial on the theory that the guaranty was <em>conditioned </em>on the lender\u2019s not extending credit in excess of $1,000. (See 20 Cal.App. at pp. 261-262.) The appellate court rejected the theory on the (hardly surprising) ground that nothing indicated the guarantor \u201cfeared that a credit in excess of the amount stated in the instrument would be injurious to her, or that she desired to control the amount of credit\u201d which the lender extended. (20 Cal.App. at p. 263.) It was in the context of showing that the language relied on by the guarantor was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1541\">*1541</page-number>only a <em>limitation </em>on the amount she was guaranteeing, not a <em>condition </em>precedent to her liability, that the court made its ambiguity statement. (See fn. 9 <em>ante.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1313-5\">It is true that guaranty contracts are not contracts of adhesion. <em>(Security Pacific National Bank </em>v. <em>Adamo </em>(1983) 142 Cal.App.3d 492, 497-498 [191 Cal.Rptr. 134].) But that cannot reverse the usual rule that ambiguities are construed against the drafter. <em>Adamo </em>used the phrase \u201ccontract of adhesion\u201d to refer to a certain kind of \u201cunenforceable\u201d contract, i.e., one which defeats the reasonable expectation of the adhering party, not to an ordinary garden-variety agreement which, while nonetheless enforceable, still must be construed against the drafter. (See 142 Cal.App.3d at p. 497.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-6\">Finally, our conclusion is buttressed by the absence of any mention of section 580d. It would seem that, even if waiver language did not actually tell the guarantor of the substance of the <em>Gradsky </em>defense, it might at least tell the guarantor that he or she is waiving any defense or benefit based on the underlying statutory basis of the <em>Gradsky </em>opinion, that is, section 580d. Indeed, the section was specifically mentioned in both the language in <em>Mariners </em>(held explicit) and in the form waiver given in a recent treatise, 1 California Real Property Financing (Cont.Ed.Bar 1988). (See \u00a7 7.20, p. 320.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-7\">We turn now to the language in paragraph 5. On first reading, the core sentence of this paragraph appears absolutely hopeless. The sentence is a disjunctive nightmare, larded with \u201cors.\" If we puzzle over the sentence long enough, though, we eventually discover that it is structured around two alternatives. The guarantor waives \u201cany defense\u201d either (1) <em>by reason of any disability or other defense of Debtor, its successor or endorser or co-maker or other guarantor, </em>or (2) <em>by reason of the cessation from any cause whatsoever of the liability of Debtor or endorser or co-maker, or other guarantor.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1313-8\">The best one can make of the first alternative is that the guarantor is waiving any \u201cdefense based on any defense\u201d of the debtor. This statement, however, is even more general than the \u201call suretyship defenses\u201d language which was held to be insufficiently explicit in <em>Indusco. </em>It is simply too broad to pass muster as a \u201cspecific waiver\u201d of estoppel rights. (See <em>Indusco, supra, </em>40 Cal.App.3d at p. 462, fn. 4.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-9\">The second alternative, centered on the words \u201ccessation from any cause whatsoever of the liability of the Debtor,\u201d is even harder to understand. A lawyer, familiar with note and deed of trust practice, might deduce that the words allude to the one-action rule. But even then, so what? The relation between, on the one hand, a defense \u201cby reason\u201d of the debtor\u2019s ceasing to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1542\">*1542</page-number>be liable to the lender, and, on the other, an estoppel defense created by court decision based on the destruction of the guarantor\u2019s rights by the lender\u2019s choice of remedies is hardly self-evident. We dare say the average person would never figure it out. It took Justice Hufstedler several pages to explain the connection in <em>Gradsky.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1314-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-5\">We must therefore conclude that the language in paragraphs 4 and 5 of the continuing guaranty agreement cannot, as a matter of law, establish an express waiver of the estoppel defense articulated by <em>Gradsky. </em>Accordingly, the summary judgment in favor of Cathay Bank cannot be sustained. All other issues follow in the wake of this determination, except one\u2014should the summary judgment merely be reversed, or should we also direct that judgment be entered in Lee\u2019s favor?</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-6\">Lee also brought a motion for summary judgment. The bank defended against Lee\u2019s motion on legal grounds, arguing Lee, as a guarantor, was not covered by California\u2019s antideficiency legislation, and that Lee was liable for the contents of the guaranty, even if he did not read it before signing. The bank also asserted that the waiver language was sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-7\">What the bank did not argue is that Lee had, <em>by his conduct, </em>waived the <em>Gradsky </em>defense. (See generally <em>Consolidated Capital Income Trust </em>v. <em>Khaloghli, supra, </em>183 Cal.App.3d 107.) We confirmed at oral argument that the bank did not have any facts (beyond, of course, the guaranty itself) on which to base such a waiver. Accordingly, mere reversal would only add to court delay and the parties\u2019 legal costs by forcing Lee to bring a second motion for summary judgment, the success of which, given our opinion today, would be a foregone conclusion. We therefore reverse the summary judgment in favor of Cathay Bank and direct that judgment be entered in favor of Lee.</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-8\">Moore, J., and Wallin, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-9\">Respondent\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied July 15, 1993. Panelli, J., and Baxter, J., were of the opinion that the petition should be granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1307-11\"> Because of mathematical errors in the declaration supporting its summary judgment motion, the bank waived all sums (other than attorney fees) over $604,233.38. In addition, it waived late charges of $41,077.61.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1307-12\"> See <em>Consolidated Capital Income Trust </em>v. <em>Khaloghli </em>(1986) 183 Cal.App.3d 107, 112 [227 Cal.Rptr. 879] (\u201cGuarantors are not specifically protected by the terms of Code of Civil Procedure sections 580b and 580d . . . .\u201d); <em>Mariners Sav. &amp; Loan Assn. </em>v. <em>Neil </em>(1971) 22 Cal.App.3d 232, 236 [99 Cal.Rptr. 238, 49 A.L.R.3d 549] (\u201cThe holding in <em>Gradsky </em>clearly pointed out that Code of Civil Procedure section 580d was not directly applicable to the situation of the guarantor.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-13\">Any references in this opinion to sections 580, 580b or 580d are to the Code of Civil Procedure.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1307-14\"><em> Gradsky </em>is based on the interplay of two ideas: (1) a guarantor can pay a debtor\u2019s debt and thereby obtain the same rights against the debtor that the original lender had; and (2) a lender (and therefore a guarantor standing in a lender\u2019s shoes) cannot obtain a deficiency judgment against a debtor if the lender elects a nonjudicial foreclosure. (See generally 265 Cal.App.2d at pp. 43-47.) Taken together, the two ideas mean that if a lender elects nonjudicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1536\">*1536</page-number>foreclosure, the lender effectively destroys the guarantor\u2019s subrogation rights against the debtor. No security remains and the lender (i.e., the guarantor standing in the lender\u2019s shoes) has no further rights against the debtor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-8\">From this, the court in <em>Gradsky </em>reasoned that because only the lender has the option of preserving its rights <em>and </em>preserving the guarantor\u2019s subrogation rights (by electing judicial foreclosure), the lender must be estopped to pursue the guarantor if the lender elects a remedy which destroys the guarantor\u2019s subrogation rights. (See 265 Cal.App.2d at pp. 46-47.) The underlying rationale seems to be that the courts should remedy the basic inequity which occurs when the lender nonjudicially forecloses.

J. 127, 139.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1308-9\"> Here is the complete text:</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-10\">\u201c4.
