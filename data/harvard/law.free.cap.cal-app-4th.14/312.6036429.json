The City, defendant below, appeals from the superior court\u2019s judgment insofar as it holds that section 5.60.030(C) of the ordinance imparts unconstitutionally broad administrative discretion over the grant or denial of parade permits, and that since that section cannot be severed from the rest, the ordinance is entirely invalid. In their cross-appeal, plaintiffs, Long Beach Lesbian and Gay Pride, Inc. (LBLGP) and certain of its taxpayer-members, challenge the judgment\u2019s further declaration that numerous other features and provisions of Chapter 5.60\u2014most prominently, those requiring parade permittees to pay for City services and carry insurance\u2014are constitutionally valid. LBLGP also seeks damages from the City on account of charges paid under these provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">We hold first that the superior court correctly determined that, as drafted, the ordinance\u2019s central provision governing the issuance of permits unconstitutionally grants unrestrained discretion whether to grant or deny them, and that the section cannot be severed from the rest of the ordinance, which therefore is unconstitutional. After explaining why this holding does not moot plaintiffs\u2019 further contentions, we hold that except for the insurance requirement and the provisions for the timing of permit applications, the other challenged aspects of Chapter 5.60 are valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-9\">The Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b298-10\">LBLGP is a nonprofit corporation devoted to producing an annual parade and \u201cfestival.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The parade commemorates the lesbian and gay rights movement, publicly espouses such rights, and celebrates the participants\u2019 pride in their orientation while allowing them to enlighten the community about it. LBLGP has conducted the parade annually since 1984, on Sunday afternoons in May or June, along a 1.6-mile stretch of Ocean Boulevard, a main <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>thoroughfare of the City. The parade includes both pedestrians and motor vehicles, some pulling floats; between 1984 and 1989 the approximate number of participants grew from 300 to 1,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">For each parade, LBLGP has been subject to the permit requirements of Chapter 5.60, or a predecessor chapter with similar provisions. Chapter 5.60 prohibits the conduct in the City of any parade, as defined in section 5.60.010(D), without first procuring a permit from the city manager or his designee. (\u00a7 5.60.020(A).) The permit requirement also applies to defined \u201cfilming activity\u201d and \u201clocal special events.\u201d (\u00a7\u00a7 5.60.010(B), (C), 5.60.020(A).) An exception is made for events specially licensed by the city council. (\u00a7 5.60.020(A).)</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">A permit applicant must file an application with the city manager, at least 30 working days before the event in file case of parades (3 days and 10 days, respectively, for filmings and block parties). (\u00a7 5.60.030(A).) The city manager may issue the permit upon making certain findings (\u00a7 5.60.030(C)), and may deny or revoke it for specified reasons (\u00a7 5.60.060). Each permit includes an agreement by the permittee to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the City against losses and liabilities incurred from the conduct of the permittee or its agents. (\u00a7 5.60.070(A).) In addition, the permittee must procure a liability insurance policy covering the City and its agents, in amounts the city manager determines. (\u00a7 5.60.070(B).) The city manager may waive this requirement if the event does not present a substantial liability exposure. (\u00a7 5.60.070(C).) Finally, the permittee must pay the City for all actual costs (\u201cdepartmental service charges\u201d) it incurs in connection with the event, as well as the cost of any City property damaged or destroyed \u201cby reason of\u2019 the event. (\u00a7\u00a7 5.60.010(A), 5.60.080(A).) A cash deposit for the estimated departmental service charges must be provided at least three days before the event. (\u00a7 5.60.080(C).) Violation of file chapter is a misdemeanor. (\u00a7 5.60.120.)</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">Between 1984 and 1989, in compliance with the chapter\u2019s requirements, LBLGP annually paid the City sums for departmental service charges ranging from about $5,600 to about $18,600. Although in most instances these amounts represented unsegregated totals attributable to the parade and the contemporaneous festival, the parade\u2019s charges for 1989 ran $12,537.40. In addition, LBLGP paid premiums, for the $1 million insurance coverage the City required for both events, ranging from $910 in 1984 to $11,430 in 1985.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">Plaintiffs commenced this action in 1985. In 1986, LBLGP was unable to find an insurer willing to provide it coverage, and the City refused to waive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>or reduce that requirement. Just days before the May 1986 parade, plaintiffs obtained a preliminary injunction restraining the City from requiring insurance for it. In succeeding years after 1987, LBLGP did obtain insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">The matter proceeded to trial in 1990 and 1991. At the conclusion, the court rendered judgment declaring that Chapter 5.60 was void because the discretionary permit approval provision of section 5.60.030(C) violated the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and article I, section 2 of the California Constitution, and could not be severed from the rest of the chapter. However, the court further declared that the remaining challenged sections of Chapter 5.60 were not unconstitutional, facially or as applied. The judgment also denied recovery of LBLGP\u2019s insurance premiums and departmental service charges, except for $782.72 LBLGP had been charged in 1989 for removal of graffiti for which it was not responsible.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">The City\u2019s Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">The City\u2019s appeal contests both prongs of the trial court\u2019s holding that Chapter 5.60 is unconstitutional: first, that section 5.60.030(C), governing the granting of parade permits, violates the First Amendment, and second, that if thus unconstitutional the section cannot be severed from the rest of the chapter, resulting in its total invalidity.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We shall conclude that the trial court was correct in both respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-9\">Certain basic, settled principles frame resolution of the initial constitutional issue, and also underlie consideration of plaintiffs\u2019 further constitutional claims.  Parades such as LBLGP\u2019s, although not consisting entirely of \u201cpure speech,\u201d do constitute activity squarely within the protection of the First Amendment\u2019s guarantees of freedom of speech and assembly. (S<em>huttlesworth </em>v. <em>Birmingham </em>(1969) 394 U.S. 147, 152 [22 L.Ed.2d 162, 168, 89 S.Ct. 935] [hereafter Shuttlesworth].) In the words of a recent United States Supreme Court decision, this means that \u201c[t]he [Long Beach] ordinance requiring a permit and a fee before authorizing . . . parades, or assemblies in \u2018the archetype of a traditional public forum\u2019 [citation], is a prior restraint on speech. [Citations.] Although there is a \u2018heavy presumption\u2019 against the validity of a prior restraint [citations], the Court has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>recognized that government, in order to regulate competing uses of public forums, may impose a permit requirement on those wishing to hold a march, parade, or rally. [Citation.] Such a scheme, however, must meet certain constitutional requirements. It may not delegate overly broad licensing discretion to a government official. Further, any permit scheme controlling the time, place, and manner of speech must not be based on the content of the message, must be narrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental interest, and must leave open ample alternatives for communication.\u201d <em>(Forsyth County </em>v. <em>Nationalist Movement </em>(1992) 505 U.S._,_[120 L.Ed.2d 101, 111, 112 S.Ct. 2395] [hereafter <em>Forsyth County].)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">Perhaps the most fundamental and frequently invoked of these requirements is that permit laws must not confide overly vague, overly broad, or, a fortiori, unlimited discretion to officials entrusted with the grant or denial of permits. <em>(Forsyth County, supra, </em>505 U.S. at p._[120 L.Ed.2d at p. 111]; <em>Shuttlesworth, supra, </em>394 U.S. at p. 153 [22 L.Ed.2d at pp. 168-169]; <em>Dillon </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 860, 866-869 [94 Cal.Rptr. <em>777, </em>484 P.2d 945] [hereafter <em>Dillon].) </em>Without precise governing standards, an administrator may freely pick and choose among the constitutionally protected events to be allowed. \u201cThe First Amendment prohibits the vesting of such unbridled discretion in a government official.\u201d <em>(Forsyth County, supra, </em>505 U.S. at p._ v[120 L.Ed.2d at p. 113], fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b301-9\">The trial court found section 5.60.030(C) to be unconstitutional under the foregoing principles. Section 5.60.030(C) sets forth a number of criteria that must be satisfied before a permit may issue. The criteria pertain chiefly to traffic hazards; their particular validity is not at issue at this point, although it will be on plaintiffs\u2019 appeal. However, the section initially provides as follows: \u201cThe city manager or his designee <em>may </em>issue a permit under this chapter if it is determined that the following criteria have been met: . . . .\u201d (Italics added.) The trial court ruled that the section, \u201cby using the word <em>may </em>as opposed to shall or some other imperative, grants the City Manager or his designee unbridled discretion to deny or reject a special events application even if all the criteria set forth in th[e] Section have been met.\u201d Because the remainder of Chapter 5.60 imposed no further limit on this discretion, the court held that section 5.60.030(C) could not stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-10\">The court\u2019s ruling finds ample support in, among other authorities, <em>Dillon, supra, 4 </em>Cal.3d 860. There, the court confronted an ordinance which provided in part that \u201c \u2018Parades and/or civic demonstrations which obstruct the free use of the public streets and/or sidewalks may be permitted provided the following conditions are met: [list of conditions including presentation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>application, police department approval, and payment for \u201cextra police officers and/or firemen\u201d if required].\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 863, fn. 2.) The court struck down this ordinance because it allowed unbounded licensing discretion, in two ways. \u201cThe . . . ordinance is not only devoid of all standards but, to make matters worse, contains no guarantee that a permit will issue even if the application meets all of the five conditions of the section. . . . Assuming the conditions are met, the section states only that parades and demonstrations <em>\"may </em>be permitted.\u2019 (Italics added.) [][] In short, the section is a barefaced example of uncontrolled discretion.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 870.)</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">The City attempts to distinguish section 5.60.030(C) in light of another section, section <em>5.60.060, </em>which provides that a permit may be denied or revoked if the application contains any false statements or the applicant has not otherwise complied with Chapter 5.60 or has violated any other law or regulation. From this framework the City concludes that section 5.60.030(C) must be read as requiring that the permit <em>shall </em>be granted if the section\u2019s traffic-related criteria are met and no grounds for denial under section 5.60.060 appear. In support of this reading, the City quotes the city manager\u2019s testimony that he would so construe the section.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">These arguments are unavailing. In <em>Dillon, supra, </em>4 Cal.3d 860, the Supreme Court rejected a similar argument that the ordinance should be read as imposing \u201ca ministerial duty of issuing a permit upon determination of the suitability of the time, place and manner of the proposed activity.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 871.) The court was unwilling to disregard the plain meaning of the enactment\u2019s permissive language: \u201cAs shown above, the ordinance provides that a permit <em>may </em>be issued if the conditions of subdivision (b) are met. The ordinance does not provide that a permit <em>must </em>issue if the time, place and manner are suitable.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">Furthermore, in the present case the city manager\u2019s testimony about the proper construction of section 5.60.030(C) did not refer to section 5.60.060, and it was impeached by his pretrial deposition testimony that \u201csince it [\u00a7 5.60.030(C)] doesn\u2019t say that the city manager shall issue a permit, I presume that it is intended that it be discretionary with the city manager.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b302-8\">Faced with this ambivalence by the official charged with enforcing the section, we cannot depart from its plain language, or from the Supreme Court\u2019s treatment of similar language in <em>Dillon, supra. </em>Notwithstanding its internal guidelines, section 5.60.030(C) ultimately reposes in the city manager open-ended discretion whether or not to issue permits. It therefore was correctly held unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>The remaining issue on the City\u2019s appeal is whether, contrary to the trial court\u2019s holding, section 5.60.030(C) may be severed from the rest of Chapter 5.60. The City urges severance is appropriate, because the Long Beach Municipal Code contains a general severability provision, and because, as the City sees it, Chapter 5.60\u2019s definitions and provisions for insurance and for payment and refund of departmental service charges (\u00a7\u00a7 5.60.010, 5.60.070-5.60.090) are physically capable of severance, and would readily have been enacted even without the permit provision of section 5.60.030(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">We cannot agree.  The City is correct that severability of an unconstitutional portion of a statute requires the mechanical qualification of verbal separability, and, ultimately a judgment whether the enacting body would have enacted the remaining portions without the invalid one. <em>(Santa Barbara Sch. Dist. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1975) 13 Cal.3d 315, 330-331 [118 Cal.Rptr. 637, 530 P.2d 605].)  But the portions of the chapter which the City seeks to save do not pass these tests. The insurance and departmental service charges provisions all are addressed in terms to the holder of a permit, granted under and in accordance with section 5.60.030(C). With the pivotal permit-granting function unconstitutionally structured, these sections have no verbal anchor or basis. Conversely, even assuming the City manifestly wished to enjoy the benefits of insurance coverage and departmental service charge reimbursement by those who parade within it, such regulation cannot be reconstructed over the invalidity of the licensing provision upon which it is based.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">In short, the trial court\u2019s invalidation of section 5.60.030(C) has removed the hub from Chapter 5.60\u2019s wheel, and without it the spokes cannot stand. In these circumstances of verbal and functional inseverability, the City\u2019s general severability clause cannot save the ordinance. <em>(Santa Barbara Sch. Dist. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>13 Cal.3d at p. 331.) We must affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment that Chapter 5.60 is invalid, together with and by dint of section 5.60.030(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">Plaintiffs\u2019 Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"AGK\">1. <em>Mootness.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b303-9\">Plaintiffs\u2019 appeal challenges the trial court\u2019s declaration that various other sections of Chapter 5.60 do not violate the First Amendment.  Our conclusion that the trial court properly held section 5.60 invalid as a whole <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>raises a threshold issue of whether it is necessary or proper to address these contentions. The issue involves an intersection of the doctrines of mootness, judicial restraint, and advisory opinions.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">In one sense, plaintiffs\u2019 further challenges to Chapter 5.60 could be considered moot, because plaintiffs have already received an adjudication that the entire ordinance is invalid. Under this practical view, to opine further concerning the intrinsic validity of some of the sections that have been swept away could be characterized as an impermissible advisory opinion (see <em>Younger </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 102, 119-120 [145 Cal.Rptr. 674, 577 P.2d 1014]), and certainly at variance with the venerable doctrine that constitutional questions should not be decided unless absolutely necessary (see <em>Palermo </em>v. <em>Stockton Theatres, Inc. </em>(1948) 32 Cal.2d 53, 65-66 [195 P.2d 1]).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">However, plaintiffs\u2019 appeal is not truly moot. Plaintiffs seek reversal of so much of the judgment as has actually, adversely decided portions of their case. These include tangible claims for damages based on the alleged unconstitutionality of sections 5.60.070-5.60.080. Moreover, were we to dismiss the appeal without disturbing the declaratory portions of the judgment adverse to plaintiffs, plaintiffs would be bound by them without having received appellate review. That posture could be more than theoretically uncomfortable, because if the City on remand were to reenact Chapter 5.60 after changing \u201cmay\u201d in section 5.60.030(C) to \u201cshall,\u201d plaintiffs could be precluded by collateral estoppel from further pressing their alternative challenges to the ordinance. (Cf. <em>Viejo Bancorp, Inc. </em>v. <em>Wood </em>(1989) 217 Cal.App.3d 200, 205-206 [265 Cal.Rptr. 620] [dismissal for mootness refused where issue decided by ruling that had expired would bar its relitigation in another action pending between the parties].)</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">Any offense against the rules precluding advisory opinions or premature constitutional adjudication has thus already been worked, by the very judgment under review. Although we could restore the adjudicative status quo ante by reversing the remaining portions of the declaratory judgment on this ground (cf. Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1061), that would force the parties to begin anew expensive litigation should Chapter 5.60 be reenacted. We believe the more appropriate alternative is to resolve plaintiffs\u2019 fully briefed contentions now. Even assuming they could be considered presently moot, they present questions of public interest which are likely to recur, indeed between these very parties. (See <em>Downtown Palo Alto Com. for Fair Assessment </em>v. <em>City Council </em>(1986) 180 Cal.App.3d 384, 391-392 [225 Cal.Rptr. 559]; 9 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (3d ed. 1985) Appeal, \u00a7 526, pp. 509-513.) We proceed to the merits of plaintiffs\u2019 appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>2. <em>Vagueness.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\"> Plaintiffs contend that two aspects of Chapter 5.60 are unconstitutionally vague and indefinite: the definition of \u201cparades\u201d that requires a permit application (\u00a7 5.60.10(D)), and the criteria by which the city manager is to determine whether a permit may be granted (\u00a7 5.60.030(C)).  These issues invoke two separate but similar constitutional precepts: the due process requirement (U.S. Const., Amends. 5, 14) that statutes, especially penal laws and even more specially those restraining speech, clearly guide what a person must do or forgo (7 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (9th ed. 1988) Constitutional Law, \u00a7\u00a7 104-105, pp. 157-159); and the First Amendment\u2019s demand that regulations of protected activity incorporate \u201c \u2018narrowly drawn, reasonable and definite standards.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Forsyth County, supra, </em>505 U.S. at p._[120 L.Ed.2d at p. 113].) We agree with the trial court that the two features of Chapter 5.60 so challenged do not violate these strictures.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">Section 5.60.010(D) provides that \u201c \u2018Parade,\u2019 as used in this chapter, means and includes a parade, procession, march, pageant, review, ceremony or exhibition which is conducted in, on, upon, or along any portion of any public street, sidewalk or other property owned or controlled by the city, so as to impede, obstruct, impair or interfere with the free use of such public street, sidewalk or other public property of the city; except . . . funeral processions.\u201d There is no room for argument that the list of seven activities at the beginning of the definition is unclear. Nor is the section\u2019s limitation to parades that impede, obstruct, or interfere with the free use of streets, sidewalks and facilities impermissibly vague or uninformative. Similar language in penal statutes governing the use of streets has historically been sustained against vagueness challenges. (See <em>In re Cox </em>(1970) 3 Cal.3d 205, 221, 223 [90 Cal.Rptr. 24, 474 P.2d 992].)</p>\n<p id=\"b305-9\">Plaintiffs\u2019 attack on the parade definition rests primarily not on its wording but on claimed inconsistencies in the testimony of various responsible city officials about when the permit requirement would apply. But the alleged inconsistencies which plaintiffs extract do not fairly represent the whole of the witnesses\u2019 responses. Fully read, the testimony reflected a coherent, consistent construction of the rules and responsibilities that appear in the text of the provision. Section 5.60.010(D)\u2019s definition of \u201cparade\u201d withstands the vagueness test.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-10\">Section 5.60.030(C), as questioned here, provides as preconditions to a permit that the city manager or his designee determine that seven <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>numbered criteria have been met. Two of these relate only to filming activities and block parties. Another requires determination that the proposed activity is not subject to other permit procedures or governing laws. Yet another is that the \u201c[t]he proposed use, event or activity will not have a significant adverse environmental impact.\u201d (Cf. Pub. Resources Code, \u00a7 21002.1 [Cal. Environmental Quality Act].) The remaining three criteria parallel but qualify the elements in the definition of \u201cparade\u201d: they require that the event will not \u201cunduly\u201d impede, etc., public use of the street, etc., or the operation of emergency vehicles or city services and functions, and that it will not present \u201ca substantial or unwarranted safety or traffic hazard.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">Plaintiffs focus their fire on the latter criteria, and particularly on the administrative power or discretion to determine whether the street interference posed is \u201cundue.\u201d Plaintiffs liken this standard to the permit law in <em>Shuttlesworth, supra, </em>394 U.S. 147 which allowed a commission to deny a permit if \u201c \u2018in its judgment the public welfare, peace, safety, health, decency, good order, morals or convenience require that it be refused.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 149-150 [22 L.Ed.2d at pp. 166-167].) But in striking down these standards as too indefinite, the Supreme Court pointedly noted that they were \u201cbroad criteria entirely unrelated to legitimate municipal regulation of the public streets and sidewalks.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 153 [22 L.Ed.2d at pp. 168-169].) The same cannot be said of the City\u2019s criteria under challenge. All of them directly concern street and common area use, congestion, and safety. Moreover, the measures of obstruction, etc., they provide are not beyond common or objective understanding. <em>(Rutherford </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1987) 188 Cal.App.3d 1267, 1279 [233 Cal.Rptr. 781].) The standards are not void for uncertainty.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">3. <em>Time Limits.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">Plaintiffs make three distinct challenges to aspects of Chapter 5.60 involving time limits for the permit process. For various First Amendment reasons, plaintiffs attack (1) section 5.60.030(A)\u2019s requirement that a parade permit application be filed at least 30 working days prior to the permit\u2019s effective date; (2) the same subsection\u2019s authorizing a discretionary waiver of that requirement by the city manager or his designee; and (3) the chapter\u2019s lack of a specific time limit for decision of the application. We consider these issues in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">Section 5.60.030(A) requires 30 working days\u2019 advance permit application for parades and for many other events subject to the chapter; however, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>advance time is only 10 days for block parties, and 3 for filming activities.  Relying on <em>N.A.A.C.P., Western Region </em>v. <em>City of Richmond </em>(9th Cir. 1984) 743 F.2d 1346 (hereafter Richmond), plaintiffs contend that, particularly in view of the lesser period for other activities, the more than one-month advance application requirements for parades inhibits constitutionally protected activity, both by reducing the degree of spontaneity allowable and by coercing disclosure of plans and intentions, and that these impacts are not sufficiently justified by important governmental purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\"><em>Richmond </em>provides strong support for plaintiffs\u2019 position. <em>Richmond </em>involved an archetypal conflict with timely speech: because of the city\u2019s 20-day permit application requirement and the unavailability of the officials who could waive it, the NAACP faced prohibition of a march, on 5 days\u2019 notice, to protest a contemporaneous decision not to investigate a prisoner\u2019s death. The <em>Richmond </em>court invalidated the 20-day requirement on its face, even though the court discerned a substantial public purpose in parade permit schemes, and also perceived the ordinance as content-neutral. Noting that advance notice requirements inhibit and reduce the quantity of speech, the court observed that many metropolitan parade ordinances required substantially less notice than Richmond\u2019s\u2014for example, San Francisco required only 24 hours. (Richmond, <em>supra, </em>743 F.2d at pp. 1356-1357.) The court dismissed the city\u2019s undocumented claim that its 20-day period struck a \u201c \u2018fair balance.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1356.)</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">Long Beach\u2019s substantially greater period can fare no better. The City contends that \u201cthe scope of the event must be the determinative factor in the actual processing time required.\u201d But section 5.60.030(A) is nowise so restricted. And although the City insists that \u201can event the size and magnitude of the Rose Parade could not be approved in less than thirty days,\u201d it has not shown the need to require that much time for plaintiffs\u2019 far more diminutive parade, not to mention all parades as defined in section 5.60.010(D). We cannot discern sufficient justification for the blanket 30-day requirement of section 5.60.030(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">Section 5.60.030(A) also provides that \u201cThe city manager or his designee shall have the authority, in his discretion, to consider any application for a permit which is filed later than the time prescribed in this section.\u201d Although the City points to this ameliorative allowance as a reason to uphold the 30-day requirement, plaintiffs separately challenge the provision, on grounds it lacks the standards necessary in this First Amendment area.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">This challenge too is meritorious. The waiver is the obverse of the otherwise strict advance filing requirement. Whether or not to apply either</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>must be determined under clear standards; it may not be left to the unguided discretion of an official. (Accord, <em>Richmond, supra, </em>743 F.2d at p. 1357 [invalidating similar provision]; see <em>Forsyth County, supra, </em>505 U.S. at p._ [120 L.Ed.2d at pp. 111, 113].) Absent any standards, the provision cannot stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">Plaintiffs also contest the failure of Chapter 5.60 to impose time limits upon when the city manager must approve or disapprove a permit application. Plaintiffs argue, with strong support, that in the First Amendment licensing area delay can pragmatically constitute denial. (See <em>Lakewood </em>v. <em>Plain Dealer </em>(1988) 486 U.S. 750, 771-772 [100 L.Ed.2d 771, 791-793, 108 S.Ct. 2138]; <em>Freedman </em>v. <em>Maryland </em>(1965) 380 U.S. 51, 58-59 [13 L.Ed.2d 649, 654-655, 85 S.Ct. 734]; <em>Shuttlesworth, supra, </em>394 U.S. at pp. 161-163 [22 L.Ed.2d at pp. 173-175] (cone. opn. of Harlan, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b308-8\">Although Chapter 5.60 technically does not specify when the permit decision must be made, it implies that this will occur within three days before the permit date: that is when the permittee must pay fees and estimated service charges. (\u00a7\u00a7 5.60.040; 5.60.080(C).) But even that construction allows uncertainty until very late. Plaintiffs\u2019 primary grievance is with the failure to require a decision within a specific time after the application is made. Plaintiffs do not purport, or ask us, to dictate what a reasonable, acceptable time is. They only complain that to leave the matter open-ended impermissibly places the fate of a parade application in official limbo, both chilling and freezing the applicant\u2019s free speech intentions and expectations.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-9\">The City has not contested the legal proposition that avoidance of limbo requires a deadline for action following application. We believe the authorities cited above support that requirement. Accordingly, Chapter 5.60\u2019s failure to include such an express limit is improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-10\">4. <em>Permit Revocation.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b308-11\">Section 5.60.060 provides as follows: \u201cThe city manager or his designee may deny any application for a permit or revoke any permit if the city manager or his designee determines that the applicant therefor or holder thereof or any agent, employee or associate of any such applicant or permit-tee has made any false or misleading statement in an application or has not fully complied with the requirements of this chapter or has violated any of the provisions of this chapter or the provisions of any other applicable law, rule or regulation. <em>Any permit issued under this chapter may be summarily revoked.\" </em>(Italics added.)  Plaintiffs contend that the italicized language provides for standardless discretion to revoke a permit, and therefore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>is unconstitutional for the same reasons as are the permit-granting and 30-day waiver provisions of sections 5.60.030(A) and (C).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">The premise of plaintiffs\u2019 contention is that the second sentence of section 5.60.060 must be read to grant unlimited discretion, \u201cnot limited by the criteria stated in the preceding sentence.\u201d We do not agree. An at least equally reasonable construction is that the second sentence is meant to expand upon the dynamics of the revocation which the first sentence substantively authorizes. Even if there be some doubt in this regard, we must construe the section to avoid questioning its constitutionality. <em>(Palermo </em>v. <em>Stockton Theatres, Inc., supra, </em>32 Cal.2d at p. 60.) So understood and construed, section 5.60.060 does not possess the defect attributed by plaintiffs.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">5. <em>Departmental Service Charges.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">Joined by amici curiae, plaintiffs contest on several grounds the constitutionality of section 5.60.080, which requires a parade permittee to reimburse the city for, and pay in advance an estimate of, \u201call city department[al] service charges incurred in connection with or due to the permittee\u2019s activities under the permit.\u201d (\u00a7 5.60.080(A).) The section also requires that \u201c[i]f city property is destroyed or damaged by reason of permittee\u2019s use, event or activity, the permittee shall reimburse the city for the actual replacement or repair cost of the destroyed or damaged property.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">It is beyond dispute that a city is free under the First Amendment to require as a condition to a parade permit that the permittee pay fees to defray the municipal expense of ensuring traffic control and related functions occasioned by the parade. The Supreme Court unanimously so decided in <em>Cox </em>v. <em>New Hampshire </em>(1941) 312 U.S. 569 [85 L.Ed. 1049, 61 S.Ct. 762, 133 A.L.R. 1396] (hereafter <em>Cox). </em>The statute there required a permit for any \u201c \u2018parade or procession upon any public street or way\u2019 \u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 571 [85 L.Ed.2d at p. 1051]), and required the permittee to \u201c \u2018pay in advance for such license, for the use of the city or town, a sum not more than three hundred dollars for each day . . . .\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 571, fn. 1 [85 L.Ed.2d at p. 1051].)</p>\n<p id=\"b309-9\">The court first upheld the permit requirement itself, stating in part, \u201cIf a municipality has authority to control the use of its public streets for parades <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>or processions, as it undoubtedly has, it cannot be denied authority to give consideration, without unfair discrimination, to <em>time, place and manner </em>in relation to the other proper uses of the streets.\u201d <em>(Cox, supra, </em>312 U.S. at p. 576 [85 L.Ed. at pp. 1053-1054], italics added.) As for the fees, the court noted that under the New Hampshire Supreme Court\u2019s construction of the statute, they \u201chad a permissible range from $300 to a nominal amount\u201d <em>(ibid.), </em>to be adjusted according to the size and consequent attractiveness of tiie parade. Furthermore, \u201c[t]he fee was held to be \u2018not a revenue tax, but one to meet the expense incident to the administration of the Act and to the maintenance of public order in the matter licensed.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 577 [85 L.Ed. at p. 1054].) To this the court added, \u201cThere is nothing contrary to the Constitution in the charge of a fee limited to the purpose stated.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">While acknowledging the holdings of <em>Cox, </em>plaintiffs submit that its approval of a fee \u201cfrom $300 to a nominal amount\u201d cannot extend to section 5.60.080\u2019s reimbursement requirement for all departmental service charges, which in LBLGP\u2019s case have run nearly 50 times higher. Plaintiffs contend that only a \u201cnominal\u201d fee, with a waiver for the truly indigent, can avoid the constitutional pitfall of posing an impermissible obstacle to speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">This contention must fail. At one point some courts did construe <em>Cox, supra, </em>312 U.S. at page 569, \u201cas authorizing only nominal charges . . . .\u201d <em>(Cent. Fla. Nuclear Freeze Campaign </em>v. <em>Walsh </em>(11th Cir. 1985) 774 F.2d 1515, 1523.) But <em>Forsyth County, supra, </em>505 U.S. at p. _ [120 L.Ed.2d 101], laid that interpretation to rest. In <em>Forsyth County, </em>four justices squarely rejected it <em>(id. </em>at pp. 116-117 [dis. opn.]), and the other five also noted that language in <em>Murdock </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania </em>(1943) 319 U.S. 105, 116 [87 L.Ed. 1292, 1300, 63 S.Ct. 870, 146 A.L.R. 81], from which the confusion about \u201cnominal fees\u201d had arisen, \u201cdoes not mean . . . that only nominal charges are constitutionally permissible.\u201d <em>(Forsyth County, supra, </em>505 U.S. at p._ [120 L.Ed.2d at p. 115].)</p>\n<p id=\"b310-11\">Plaintiffs yet contend that because \u201cunlimited\u201d charges may de facto prevent some groups from parading, they are as unconstitutional as the license fee invalidated in <em>Murdock, supra, </em>or the poll tax struck down in <em>Harper </em>v. <em>Virginia State Bd. of Elections </em>(1966) 383 U.S. 663 [16 L.Ed.2d 169, 86 S.Ct. 1079], or the ballot access fees condemned in <em>Lubin </em>v. <em>Panish </em>(1974) 415 U.S. 709 [39 L.Ed.2d 702, 94 S.Ct. 1315]. But those charges were held impermissible\u2014two of them under equal protection principles\u2014 because they either amounted to taxes on protected activity or absolutely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>foreclosed its exercise without sufficient reason. In contrast, the departmental service fees are not taxes; they are required to defray specific public costs engendered by the permittee\u2019s own activity; and, as discussed below, they leave open expressive alternatives to those unwilling or unable to pay. In the words of <em>Cox, supra, </em>they are \u201ctime, place and manner\u201d regulations, governing how groups may parade in Long Beach to the extent of obstructing traffic (\u00a7 5.60.010(D)). As such, they may validly be imposed as long as they are not \u201cbased on the content of the message, . . . [are] narrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental interest, and . . . leave open ample alternatives for communication.\u201d <em>(Forsyth County, supra, </em>505 U.S. at p._[120 L.Ed.2d at p. 111].) We consider these factors in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">Plaintiffs contend that the departmental service fee requirement necessarily allows the fees to be based on the content of the parade. Plaintiffs argue that the use of traffic police and barricades, included among the charges, (1) will increase as the parade is more controversial or indeed more popular; and (2) will include, and has already included, expenses in anticipation of onlookers\u2019 hostility, for which a speaker cannot be made to pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">Plaintiffs\u2019 first point is not borne out, factually or legally. First, the fees in question respond to the size of the parade and its impacts on normal traffic, not the size of the crowd in attendance. Second, in <em>Cox, supra, </em>312 U.S. 569, the Supreme Court approved a flexible fee that varied according to \u201c \u2018the greater public expense of policing the spectacle, compared with the slight expense of a less expansive and attractive parade or procession, to which the charge would be adjusted.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 577 [85 L.Ed.2d at p. 1054].)</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">A more serious constitutional issue is presented, at least in the abstract, by the claim that paraders may not be saddled with the costs of protecting themselves or the public from hostile response to their parade. The Supreme Court has consistently held that \u201cListeners\u2019 reaction to speech is not a content-neutral basis for regulation. [Citations.] Speech cannot be financially burdened, any more than it can be punished or banned, simply because it might offend a hostile mob. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Forsyth County, supra, </em>505 U.S. at p._[120 L.Ed.2d at p. 114], fn. omitted.) In <em>Forsyth County, </em>the court for this reason invalidated a parade permit law which local authorities had construed to permit adjustment of the fee in light of the costs of protecting participants or observers. The court concluded, \u201cIn light of the Court\u2019s subsequent First Amendment jurisprudence, we do not read <em>Cox </em>to permit such a premium.\u201d (505 U.S. at p. _[120 L.Ed.2d at p. 115].)</p>\n<p id=\"b311-10\">These principles necessarily govern the permissible scope and application of section 5.60.080. But they do not invalidate it. For in this case the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>administrative construction and application of the ordinance starkly contrast with those that impelled the ruling in <em>Forsyth County, supra. </em>The evidence below was overwhelming that the police deployments for which LBLGP paid under section 5.60.080 were detailed for traffic control duty, and were no greater than necessary for that function. Although the City\u2019s police department had developed contingency plans for violence, that was not part of LBLGP\u2019s bill. And the fact that the traffic officers would have been called upon is of no moment: there is no content-based deficiency in a permit scheme that requires the permittee to pay costs of traffic control while incidentally providing built-in public safety protection. <em>(Stonewall Union </em>v. <em>City of Columbus </em>(6th Cir. 1991) 931 F.2d 1130, 1135-1136 [hereafter <em>Stonewall Union].) </em>In sum, section 5.60.080 is a content-neutral regulation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">The next question in determining whether the departmental service charges are a valid time, place and manner regulation is whether they are \u201cnarrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental interest.\u201d <em>(Forsyth County, supra, </em>505 U.S. at p. _[120 L.Ed.2d at p. 111].) The answer clearly is yes. Providing for traffic control to rectify a parade\u2019s disruption of normal street use is a significant governmental interest. (See <em>Stonewall Union, supra, </em>931 F.2d at p. 1134; cf. <em>Forsyth County, supra, </em>505 U.S. at p. _ [120 L.Ed.2d at p. 115.) And the charges here are most narrowly tailored, because they correspond to the actual costs of providing the services.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b312-10\">Finally, a valid time, place and manner regulation \u201cmust leave open ample alternatives for communication.\u201d <em>(Forsyth County, supra, </em>505 U.S. at p. _ [120 L.Ed.2d at p. 111].) Plaintiffs insist that both section 5.60.080 and indeed Chapter 5.60 as a whole fail this test, because they apply to all public streets, sidewalks and \u201cother public property of the city.\u201d (\u00a7 5.60.010(D).) But it is equally true that the permit requirement and the departmental service fees operate only when a group chooses to express itself in a manner calculated to obstruct traffic or the free use of the \u201cother public property.\u201d The fees thus can be avoided by any alternative choice of expressive means, including a sidewalk parade or march, however adorned, that does not interfere with traffic. \u201cNotwithstanding [plaintiffs\u2019] general assertions in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>their brief[s] concerning the utility of [an obstructive parade]\u201d <em>(City Council </em>v. <em>Taxpayers for Vincent </em>(1984) 466 U.S. 789, 812 [80 L.Ed.2d 772, 791-792, 104 S.Ct. 2118]), \u201cthere has been no showing that the remaining avenues of communication are inadequate.\u201d <em>(Ward </em>v. <em>Rock Against Racism </em>(1989) 491 U.S. 781, 802 [105 L.Ed.2d 661, 682-683, 109 S.Ct. 2746].)</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">Section 5.60.080 thus fully qualifies as a valid time, place and manner regulation of parades.  Plaintiffs and amici curiae, however, pose a final constitutional objection to the departmental service fees, and particularly to the section\u2019s requirement that a permittee reimburse the City for City property damaged or destroyed \u201cby reason of the permittee\u2019s use, event or activity.\u201d (\u00a7 5.60.080(A).) Plaintiffs contend that this responsibility runs afoul of <em>NAACP </em>v. <em>Claiborne Hardware Co. </em>(1982) 458 U.S, 886 [73 L.Ed.2d 1215, 102 S.Ct. 3409] (hereafter <em>Claiborne), </em>which held that First Amendment rights of speech and association precluded tort liability either for protected speech or for unprotected member conduct which the organization had not actually or apparently authorized or ratified.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">The relevant holding of <em>Claiborne </em>was based on traditional principles of agency. (See 458 U.S. at pp. 930-931 [73 L.Ed.2d at pp. 1247-1248].) Section 5.60.080 does not exceed its boundaries. Both the departmental service charge and cleanup reimbursement requirements are textually tied to the activities of the permittee itself. Thus, the section does not purport to impose responsibility for the acts of others. That indeed was the trial court\u2019s conclusion when confronted with a charge the City once made for cleaning up graffiti that LBLGP had not scribbled: the court held this charge did not fall within the ordinance\u2019s purview, and gave judgment awarding a refund.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">We conclude, therefore, that section 5.60.080 does not impose a forbidden burden on speech or association, and that its departmental service charge requirement is a content-neutral, adequately tailored time, place and manner restriction, valid under <em>Cox, supra, </em>312 U.S. 569, as well as more recent First Amendment jurisprudence. On this basis, the trial court properly denied plaintiffs\u2019 requests for a contrary declaration and for refund of the departmental services charges LBLGP has paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">6. <em>The Insurance Requirement.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b313-9\">Section 5.60.070(B) requires as a condition to a permit that the permittee assume a further financial burden, in addition to paying permit fees and departmental service charges. The permittee must procure and maintain throughout the permit period a liability insurance policy, \u201cwhich policy includes the city, its boards, officers, agents and employees as named <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>insureds or additional named insureds and which provides the coverages that the city manager determines to be necessary and adequate under the circumstances . . . .\u201d This insurance is required in addition to the permit\u2019s requirements, under section 5.60.070(A), that the permittee agree to defend and indemnify the City and its employees from all claims arising out of the permittee\u2019s alleged acts or omissions. Finally, the insurance requirement may be waived by the city manager if he determines that an event of not more than one day \u201cdoes not present a substantial or significant public liability or property damage exposure for the city . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 5.60.070(C).)</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">Plaintiffs challenge the insurance requirement of section 5.60.070(B) on many of the grounds on which they attacked the departmental service charges. The City defends the requirement, as it must, as being a valid time, place and manner regulation, like the departmental service charge provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">However, there are significant differences between the two provisions, both in operation and in justification. The departmental service charges are paid to the city, to reimburse costs actually incurred as a result of the permittee\u2019s activities. In contrast, the insurance provision requires payment to a third party, of amounts it determines, using whatever factors it deems appropriate. Further, the permittee makes this compelled payment in exchange not for real costs incident to the activities it intends to undertake, but rather for contingencies that may never eventuate and indeed cannot necessarily be identified. Moreover, the City\u2019s justification is correspondingly contingent, and it is advanced without regard to alternatives or to consideration of the permittee\u2019s own history of risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">The insurance requirement thus poses serious questions from the standpoint of being narrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental interest, and also realistically risks being improperly affected by \u201cthe content of the message.\u201d <em>(Forsyth County, supra, </em>505 U.S. at p. _ [120 L.Ed.2d at p. 111].)  Before exploring these questions fiirther, we consider plaintiffs\u2019 contentions that section 5.60.070 also \u201cdelegate[s] overly broad licensing discretion to a government official.\u201d (505 U.S. at p. _[120 L.Ed.2d at p. HU.)</p>\n<p id=\"b314-11\">Plaintiffs challenge section 5.60.070 in two such respects. First, subsection (B) provides that the insurance required shall \u201cprovid[e] the coverages that the city manager determines to be necessary and adequate under the circumstances.\u201d Although this standard is not as open-ended as the \u201cmay\u201d which infects section 5.60.030(C), it is extremely broad, and that uncertainty is aggravated by its reference to an unidentified \u201cpolicy of insurance.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>(Accord, <em>Rock Against Racism </em>v. <em>Ward </em>(S.D.N.Y. 1987) 658 F.Supp. 1346, 1356.) The City defends this discretion as allegedly comparable to the flexibility of parade fees, from nominal to $300, that was approved in <em>Cox, supra. </em>But the language of subsection (B) is not so constrained, monetarily or otherwise. Granting the City\u2019s argument that there must be flexibility to accommodate events as diverse in size as a parade like plaintiffs\u2019 and the Long Beach Grand Prix, section 5.60.070(B) does not really impose any restraining standards in setting the extent of the insurance, which in turn must affect its cost to the permittee.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">Plaintiffs concurrently attack subsection (C), which allows for a waiver of the insurance requirement if the city manager perceives no \u201csubstantial or significant public liability for property damage exposure.\u201d In <em>H-CHH Associates </em>v. <em>Citizens for Representative Government </em>(1987) 193 Cal.App.3d 1193, 1218-1219 [238 Cal.Rptr. 841], the court held that a similarly worded standard, for imposing insurance on pamphleteers at a shopping center, was too vague to satisfy constitutional requirements. The court further proposed a set of objective criteria far more precise than those found in section 5.60.070.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">In sum, the criteria for waiving insurance under subsection (C) are suspect, and subsection (B) is effectively devoid of standards to restrain the discretion of the city manager in fixing the insurance requirement. In the latter respect certainly, section 5.60.070 falls short of First Amendment requirements.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">Whether the insurance requirement satisfies the prime requisite of not varying by virtue of the content of the parade is problematic. On the one hand, section 5.60.070 is neutral on its face. But the evidence disclosed that determining how much a permittee must pay for insurance is a multilayered process. Counseled by its outside insurance consultant, the City fixes the coverage required. Then the amount the permittee pays is decided by the insurance marketplace.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">At both levels, concern over how controversial the parade may be has naturally slipped in. The City\u2019s consultant testified he considered such risk <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>factors as hostility to LBLGP\u2019s parade in evaluating the insurance required and the prudence vel non of recommending it be waived. He further stated that the monetary effect of such factors would be \u201cfor the underwriters in assessing the premium.\u201d Plaintiffs produced evidence of some insurers\u2019 unwillingness to insure LBLGP. And the City consultant opined generally, \u201c[I]n each case where I have seen anything relating to the underwriting of a parade ... I regret to say it reflects on the industry, but I think it is largely how much money can they get out of it is the way they would underwrite it. [f] I don\u2019t think there are very sound established principles for underwriting an event like a parade.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">Section 5.60.070\u2019s delegation of the amount of insurance charges to the market thus appears inescapably to create a system of charges subject to impact and adjustment based on \u201ccontent,\u201d including the element of hostility anticipation. That, of course, is presumptively intolerable <em>(Forsyth County, supra, </em>505 U.S. at p. _ [120 L.Ed.2d at pp. 112-115]), and it contributed to the invalidation of a parade insurance requirement in <em>Invisible Empire, KKK </em>v. <em>Mayor et al. of Thurmont </em>(D.Md. 1988) 700 F.Supp. 281, 285-286. (And cf. <em>Collin </em>v. <em>Smith </em>(7th Cir. 1978) 578 F.2d 1197, 1209 [\u201cIt is true that the requirement does not turn on the content of a proposed demonstration, except in the sense that controversial groups will likely be unable to obtain insurance, as here.\u201d].) Thus, it cannot confidently be said that the insurance requirement does not turn on the content of the paraders\u2019 message.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">Equally critical is whether the requirement is narrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental interest. <em>(Forsyth County, supra, </em>505 U.S. at p. _[120 L.Ed.2d at p. 111].) The City advances two such interests: protection of the public fisc and protection of parade spectators. But only the first of these appears from the face of section 5.60.070: the section refers throughout to the City\u2019s liability, and makes it the only concern in allowing a waiver of insurance. So cautioned, we examine both postulated purposes, and the insurance requirement\u2019s significance to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-11\">In reality, the financial protection provided the City by the insurance is extremely limited. As explained at trial by the City\u2019s insurance consultant, the $1 million combined single limit policy the City has required of LBLGP\u2014along with City contractors and the like\u2014provides for the City\u2019s defense when named in an action based on the permittee\u2019s own conduct. It does not substantively cover damages awarded for the City\u2019s own fault. Moreover, as plaintiffs and amici curiae point out, the City would face extremely limited exposure in any event, because of California Tort Claims Act limitations and immunities (Gov. Code, \u00a7\u00a7818.4, 821.2 [permits], 835 [dangerous conditions], 845 [police protection]).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>Thus, in the words of the City\u2019s consultant, the role played by the insurance requirement in protecting the City financially, \u201cis really a contingent liability primarily for defense.\u201d The City in effect is requiring the permittee to provide insurance as financial backing for its agreement to defend the City, under section 5.60.070(A). Moreover, the contingent need for that protection is further diminished in the case of plaintiffs, in that there were no claims against the City over the six-year history of plaintiffs\u2019 parade before trial. But on this account LBLGP still was required to pay thousands of dollars of premiums. Using the calculus of the First Amendment rather than that of the insurance market, it is difficult to appraise this exaction as being closely tailored to an important governmental purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">The second espoused purpose of the insurance requirement is to furnish a pool of financial coverage for injuries parade spectators may suffer from the fault of the permittee (which may, as in this case, be an uninsured organization). \u201cProtecting the public\u201d obviously qualifies as a significant governmental interest. But the question remains whether the means chosen are sufficiently necessary in view of the risks presented. Those risks, again, are by nature speculative, particularly in light of the incident- and accident-free history of LBLGP\u2019s parade. Moreover, the City\u2019s omnibus insurance requirement extends well wide of the features of the parade that might present hazards traditionally calling for insurance. Thus, although the City emphasizes that the parade includes cars and motorized floats, the City has not relied on the alternative of motor vehicle insurance, nor indeed, the insurance consultant testified, has it even \u201crequired evidence of automobile coverage on the vehicle[s] participating in the parade.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">The consultant also acknowledged the protective utility of police control, barriers, careful field organization, and participant waivers of liability, all of which have attended plaintiffs\u2019 parades. But the ordinance apparently regards these means of safety as supplementary to insurance, rather than vice versa. As the consultant stated with respect to internal parade control, \u201cI think it is far better for the City to leave that as a device for them to reduce their costs rather than for us to waive the up-front protection which we require from the promoters themselves.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">In light of this record, the after-the-fact \u201cprotection\u201d of the public provided by the insurance requirement cannot be found narrowly tailored to that end.  Although a time, place and manner regulation need not be the least restrictive means of subserving the public end in question, it must not be \u201csubstantially broader than necessary to achieve the government\u2019s interest.\u201d <em>(Ward </em>v. <em>Rock Against Racism, supra, </em>491 U.S. at p. 800 [105 L.Ed.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>at p. 681].)  Other courts that have reviewed parade insurance requirements have uniformly found them to overreach, in view of the overlapping utility and availability of other means of protection as referred to above, and the concomitant absence of a history of claims and hence need for expensive, high-limit coverage. <em>(Eastern Conn. Citizens Action Group </em>v. <em>Powers </em>(2d Cir. 1983) 723 F.2d 1050, 1056-1057; <em>Invisible Empire, KKK </em>v. <em>Mayor et al. of Thurmont, supra, </em>700 F.Supp. at p. 285; <em>Collin </em>v. <em>Smith </em>(N.D.Ill. 1978) 447 F.Supp. 676, 685, affd. (7th Cir.) 578 F.2d 1197.)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Here too, where the cost of the insurance has closely threatened (until preliminarily enjoined) to prevent plaintiffs\u2019 protected activity yet that coverage has never had to be called upon, section 5.60.070(B)\u2019s insurance requirement appears to be a relatively gratuitous burden, \u201csubstantially broader than necessary to achieve the government\u2019s interest.\u201d <em>(Ward </em>v. <em>Rock Against Racism, supra, </em>491 U.S. at p. 800 [105 L.Ed.2d at p. 681].) Given also the overbroad discretion granted the city manager in fixing the requisite coverage, and the openness to content-based costing that results from remitting a permittee to the underwriting market, the insurance requirement of section 5.60.070 cannot be upheld.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">The foregoing conclusions, like the rest of this decision, apply only with respect to parades, which enjoy First Amendment protection. The City thus is not disabled from enforcing the present insurance requirement with respect to other events, such as the Grand Prix or plaintiffs\u2019 festival. Moreover, we do not categorically condemn insurance requirements for parades. (See <em>Eastern Conn. Citizens Action Group </em>v. <em>Powers, supra, </em>723 F.2d at p. 1057.) A requirement that adhered to the requisites of a valid time, place and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>manner regulation would not be invalid. But for the numerous reasons shown, section 5.60.070, as applicable to parades, is.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">7. <em>City Subsidy of Parades.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">Plaintiffs\u2019 final contentions concern allegedly discriminatory relaxation of the parade regulations of Chapter 5.60. Section 3.64.100 of the Long Beach Municipal Code creates a \u201cspecial advertising and promotion fund,\u201d which is to be used, inter alia, \u201cFor advertising, promotional, and public relations projects calling attention to the city, its natural advantages, resources, enterprises, attractions, climate, and facilities.\u201d The City has used this fund to pay the departmental service charges for several parades, including a Martin Luther King Day parade and the culmination of a national Hands Across America parade at the Queen Mary. Except for the Martin Luther King Day parade, which was supported in celebration of a national holiday, the City chose to subsidize these events on the basis that they gave the City public and economic exposure, often televised. However, the City in 1987 declined LBLGP\u2019s request for similar sponsorship. Plaintiffs contend this defrayal of parade charges constitutes impermissible content discrimination in the administration of the departmental service and related charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">We disagree. In using the promotional fund the City has not maintained or administered section 5.60.080 to disfavor or suppress one viewpoint in favor of another. Rather, the City has used its funds to promote and facilitate events it sponsors or otherwise encourages, for the benefit of the City. The departmental service charges are not discriminatorily applied: they are imposed on all, but in some cases paid by the City\u2019s treasury. \u201cA refusal to fund protected activity, without more, cannot be equated with the imposition of a \u2018penalty\u2019 on that activity.\u201d <em>(Harris </em>v. <em>McRae </em>(1980) 448 U.S. 297, 317, fn. 19 [65 L.Ed.2d 784, 804-805, 100 S.Ct. 2671].)</p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">The same issue was presented in <em>Stonewall Union, supra, </em>931 F.2d 1130, wherein the organizers of a gay rights parade complained about the city\u2019s sponsoring and paying the fees of other parades. The court stated: \u201c[Although plaintiffs have a First Amendment right to parade on behalf of gay and lesbian rights, they do not have a right to demand that the City . . . sponsor that right by paying their parade permit fees because it sponsors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>other speech-related activities. If defendants can adequately show that the parades which they have sponsored and for which they have paid the permit fees are reasonably related to the government function which the sponsoring department of the city government performs, . . . [that] does not mean that the ordinance is discriminatorily applied.\u201d <em>{Id. </em>at p. 1138.)</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">In the same vein, plaintiffs also challenge, as allegedly granting unconfined discretion, the preliminary language of section 5.60.020(A), which excepts from the permit requirement activity conducted \u201cpursuant to the terms of a permit, lease or contract which has been specifically authorized by the city council.\u201d But this preamble is not of the same nature as the portions of Chapter 5.60 we have held grant overbroad discretion. It is not a delegation of power to an official but a recognition of the innate authority of the City\u2019s legislative body. The city council has the power to grant special permits, and to amend Chapter 5.60; the mere existence of that potential does not present a case of unguided discretion. And plaintiffs\u2019 claim that the council authorized the Martin Luther King Day parade without sufficient formality presents a municipal law question, not a constitutional one.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">The judgment is reversed insofar as it sustains the constitutionality of section 5.60.070 with respect to parades, and of section 5.60.030 insofar as it provides for a 30-working-day permit application period for parades and for waiver thereof, and fails to provide a time limit for decision of a parade permit application. The trial court shall enter declaratory judgment for plaintiffs on those issues. In all other respects, the judgment is affirmed. The parties shall bear their own costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-9\">Gates, Acting P.

Although, as plaintiffs note, the California provisions have been said to afford even greater rights than the federal (e.g., <em>Robins </em>v. <em>Pruneyard Shopping Center </em>(1979) 23 Cal.3d 899, 908 [153 Cal.Rptr. 854, 592 P.2d 341]), we do not perceive in the issues or in plaintiffs\u2019 arguments any necessity to distinguish between them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b309-10\"> Plaintiffs support their interpretation by noting that the predecessor to section 5.60.060 contained a similar provision for summary revocation, which specified emergency circumstances as authorizing it. The present omission of those grounds does not necessarily mean the procedure is now standardless, as opposed to limited to the grounds stated in the first sentence. As stated, we read the section more naturally to mean the latter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b310-12\"> The court further saw no constitutional infringement in levying a flexible rather than a flat charge, \u201cin the light of varying conditions.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b312-13\"> We reject amici curiae\u2019s further contention that content discrimination arises because the ordinance singles out speech-related activity for charges not elsewhere imposed. Section 5.60.080 applies to a host of activities, speech (e.g. this parade) and nonspeech (e.g., the Long Beach Grand Prix), whose common, predictable, intentional feature and effect is to displace traffic. That is the basis for the charge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b312-18\"> Plaintiffs object to the City\u2019s charging for a full day\u2019s amortized use of police vehicles and other equipment, regardless of what fraction of a day they actually were used. The daily rates for police cars were $23-$24. Whether or not such charges deviate from a proper understanding of section 5.60.080, they do not render the section too broadly \u201ctailored.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b315-9\"> Indeed, section 5.60.070(B) is so vague as to preclude informed consideration of plaintiffs\u2019 separate contention, that the insurance requirement violates the principles of associational tort responsibility stated in <em>Claiborne, supra, </em>458 U.S. 886. For we do not know whose liabilities, and for what, the insurance must respond to.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-10\">fHowever, assuming section 5.60.070(B) were read to mirror the more specific indemnity requirement of section 5.60.070(A), we question whether requiring such insurance would run afoul of <em>Claiborne. </em>Subsection (A) refers to liabilities incurred \u201cas a result of the alleged acts or omissions of permittee or permittee\u2019s officers, agents or employees.\u201d If construed to mean authorized acts, this language would satisfy <em>Claiborne.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b318-6\"> The last case bears quoting: \u201c[T]he burdensome effect of the insurance requirement itself has not been shown to be necessary. The government may impose financial burdens on the exercise of First Amendment rights, such as permit fees, only when the amount involved is reasonable and directly related to the accomplishment of legitimate governmental purposes. [Citations.] In this case, defendants have presented no evidence whatsoever of the . . . need for such a burdensome insurance requirement. Nothing in the record shows that Skokie or any comparable municipality has ever been threatened with damage by a public assembly which would have been prevented or alleviated by an insurance requirement of this type.\u201d <em>(Collin </em>v. <em>Smith, supra, </em>447 F. Supp. at p. 685.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b318-7\"> In support of the requirement\u2019s validity, the City cites <em>Jacobsen </em>v. <em>Harris </em>(8th Cir. 1989) 869 F.2d 1172, which upheld against First Amendment challenge an ordinance that required publishers who wished to emplace newsracks on city property to carry liability insurance for them. The court emphasized that the ordinance required all persons using city property to insure the city against obstructions on it, and that there had been a history of claims based on such obstructions. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1174.) In light of the factors and authorities discussed above, we do not consider the <em>Jacobsen </em>case\u2019s one-paragraph holding dispositive here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b319-9\"> We decline LBLGP\u2019s request for reversal and direction of judgment in its favor on its claim for damages from the City in the amount of the insurance premiums LBLGP has paid. Not only did LBLGP fail to establish the amounts attributable to the parade as opposed to the festival, but more fundamentally LBLGP has not presented a coherent theory of why the City should be held liable for sums paid to insurers in exchange for coverage provided. LBLGP has not carried its burden of establishing a right to judgment on this claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
