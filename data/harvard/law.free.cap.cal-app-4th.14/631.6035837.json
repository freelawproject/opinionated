Our answer is yes. Accordingly we reverse the summary judgment awarded respondents. We also modify the trial court\u2019s order awarding costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">On April 21, 1986, George Desplanche (decedent) fell on a construction site stairway. He died five days later.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">Two actions were filed: a wrongful death complaint by his wife (Vesta Desplanche) and four adult children against the general contractor (Ron Wilson, Norm Wilson and Ron Wilson Construction Company) and stairway subcontractor (Robert and Nancy Shallenberger and Anvil Iron, Inc.) and a personal injury complaint by Vesta Desplanche, as special administrator of the estate, against the same defendants. The actions were later consolidated.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-9\">The general contractor moved for summary judgment. The trial court granted the motion. Appellants initially sought review of that summary judgment but, in their opening brief, abandoned such review. Accordingly, that matter is not part of this appeal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b569-10\">The subcontractor also moved for summary judgment but only against the four adult children of the decedent (not his wife). The trial court granted the motion. We review this order.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-11\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b569-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-13\">Section 377, as here applicable, provided: \u201cWhen the death of a person is caused by the wrongful act . . . of another, his or her <em>heirs </em>. . . may maintain an action for damages against the person causing the death. . . .\u201d (\u00a7 377, subd. (a). Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b569-14\">Subcontractor contends the decedent\u2019s children are not \u201cheirs\u201d and therefore may not maintain the instant action. Subcontractor relies upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>section 377, subdivision (b) which, as here applicable, provided: \u201cFor the purposes of subdivision (a), \u2018heirs\u2019 means only the following: [f] (1) Those persons who would be entitled to succeed to the property of the decedent according to the provisions of Part 2 (commencing with Section 6400) of Division 6 of the Probate Code. [1] (2) Whether or not qualified under paragraph (1), if they were dependent on the decedent, the putative spouse, children of the putative spouse, stepchildren, and parents. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">Subcontractor argues the adult children are not \u201cpersons who would be entitled to succeed to the property of the decedent\u201d (because his property was entirely community property and was all bequeathed to his surviving spouse), were not \u201cdependent on the decedent,\u201d are not \u201cchildren of [a] <em>putative </em>spouse,\u201d are not \u201cstepchildren\u201d and thus are outside each of the statutory classifications of \u201cheirs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">Appellant children disagree, asserting they are heirs because they are \u201cpersons who <em>would </em>be entitled to succeed to the property of the decedent . . . ,\u201d and for this purpose the decedent should be considered intestate.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">Both parties cite the same statutes and rely on the same cases: <em>Steed </em>v. <em>Imperial Airlines </em>(1974) 12 Cal.3d 115 [115 Cal.Rptr. 329, 524 P.2d 801, 68 A.L.R.3d 1204]; <em>Mayo </em>v. <em>White </em>(1986) 178 Cal.App.3d 1083 [224 Cal.Rptr. 373]; <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Regional Center of the East Bay </em>(1985) 174 Cal.App.3d 350 [220 Cal.Rptr. 89].) We find none of these cases dispositive.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">Not cited by the parties and dispositive of this appeal is <em>Fiske </em>v. <em>Wilkie </em>(1945) 67 Cal.App.2d 440 [154 P.2d 725]. At oral argument we requested the parties to brief the applicability of <em>Fiske </em>v. <em>Wilkie </em>and section 377.60. We have considered these supplemental briefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-8\">In <em>Fiske, </em>just as in the instant\u00ae case, children of a decedent brought a wrongful death action. The defendant argued, just as subcontractor does in the instant case, the plaintiff children were not heirs under section 377 because the decedent had a surviving spouse (who died several months later) to whom all the decedent\u2019s property passed. Thus, the spouse was decedent\u2019s sole heir and his children\u2014the plaintiffs\u2014were not heirs.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-9\"><em>Fiske </em>rejected the argument. It held that such children of the decedent are heirs and may maintain a wrongful death action for the loss of a parent. (67 Cal.App.2d at p. 444.)</p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>We note that in 1992 section 377 was repealed (Stats. 1992, ch. 178, \u00a7 19 (Sen. Bill No. 1496)) and reenacted as section 377.60.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As the California Law Revision Commission Comments state: \u201cSection 377.60 restates subdivision (b) and the first part of the first sentence of subdivision (a) of former Section 377 without substantive change. . . . H] Subdivision (a) revises the language of former Section 377(b)(1) to refer specifically to the decedent\u2019s surviving spouse, children, and issue of deceased children, as proper parties plaintiff in a wrongful death action. This makes clear that, even if the decedent\u2019s estate is entirely community property, the decedent\u2019s children and issue of deceased children are proper parties plaintiff, along with the decedent\u2019s surviving spouse. This codifies Fiske v. Wilkie, 67 Cal.App.2d 440, 444, . . .\u201d (Cal. Law Revision Com. com., Deering\u2019s Ann. Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 377.60 (1993 pocket supp.) p. 16.)</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">Appellant children are \u201cheirs\u201d within the meaning of former section 377, and the trial court erred in granting subcontractor\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">Section 1032 entitles the prevailing party to costs. The trial court awarded costs to contractor including $4,254.63 for expert witness fees. Since it is undisputed these expert witnesses were not ordered by the court the cost award was not authorized by section 1033.5, subdivision (a)(8) (\u201c(a) The following items are allowable as costs under Section 1032: [&lt;j[] . . . ffl] (8) Fees of expert witnesses ordered by the court.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">Section 1033.5, subdivision (b)(1) prohibits \u201c[fjees of experts not ordered by the court\u201d unless \u201cexpressly authorized by law.\u201d Section 998<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> expressly authorizes such costs but only if a settlement demand has been made. It is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>undisputed no such demand was made by contractor. Accordingly, the trial court erred in including $4,254.63 for expert witness fees in its cost award to contractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">The order granting summary judgment for subcontractor respondents is reversed. The trial court\u2019s order awarding costs to contractor respondents is vacated. The trial court shall enter a new order awarding costs to contractor which omits $4,254.63 in expert witness fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">Costs on appeal are awarded to appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">The matter is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">Lillie, P. J., and Johnson, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-9\">Respondents\u2019 petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied June 24, 1993.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b569-15\"> Statutory references, unless otherwise noted, are to the Code of Civil Procedure.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b569-16\"> We do consider the trial court\u2019s order awarding costs to the general contractor.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b571-9\"> The section reads: \u201cA cause of action for the death of a person caused by the wrongful act or neglect of another may be asserted by any of the following persons or by the decedent's personal representative on their behalf:</p>\n<p id=\"b571-10\">\u201c(a) The decedent\u2019s surviving spouse, children, and issue of deceased children, or, if none, the persons who would be entitled to the property of the decedent by intestate succession.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-11\">\u201c(b) Whether or not qualified under subdivision (a), if they were dependent on the decedent, the putative spouse, children of the putative spouse, stepchildren, or parents. As used in this subdivision, \u2018putative spouse\u2019 means the surviving spouse of a void or voidable marriage who is found by the court to have believed in good faith that the marriage to the decedent was valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-12\">\u201c(c) A minor, whether or not qualified under subdivision (a) or (b), if, at the time of the decedent\u2019s death, the minor resided for the previous 180 days in the decedent\u2019s household and was dependent on the decedent for one-half or more of the minor\u2019s support.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b571-13\"> In pertinent part the section reads: \u201c(a) The costs allowed under Section 1031 and 1032 shall be withheld or augmented as provided in this section. ... [1] (c) If an offer made by a defendant is not accepted and the plaintiff fails to obtain a more favorable judgment, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>plaintiff shall not recover his or her costs and shall pay the defendant\u2019s costs from the time of the offer. In addition, in any action or proceeding other than an eminent domain action, the court, in its discretion, may require the plaintiff to pay the defendant\u2019s costs from the date of filing of the complaint and a reasonable sum to cover costs of the services of expert witnesses, who are not regular employees of any party, actually incurred and reasonably necessary in either, or both, the preparation or trial of the case by the defendant.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
