J.</author>\n<p id=\"Atd\">At a contested jurisdictional hearing, the juvenile court found Prentiss C. committed the following crimes: rape (Pen. Code, \u00a7 261. subd. (2));<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> forcible oral copulation (\u00a7 288a, subd. (c)); rape by foreign <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1486\">*1486</page-number>object (\u00a7 289, subd (a)); attempted robbery (two counts) (\u00a7\u00a7 211/664); false imprisonment (two counts) (\u00a7 236); exhibiting a firearm (\u00a7 417, subd. (b)); and disturbing the peace (\u00a7415.5). The court concluded appellant came within the provisions of Welfare and Institutions Code section 602 and committed him to the California Youth Authority. In setting the maximum period of confinement, the court calculated full consecutive terms for the sex offenses pursuant to section 667.6, subdivisions (c) and (d). Using this method, the court set the maximum period of confinement at 27 years and 5 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-4\">The minor raises only one issue on appeal. He contends the court erred by relying on section 667.6 to calculate the maximum period of confinement. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 726.) In the minor\u2019s view, the court should have calculated the maximum period of confinement by imposing one-third the base term for the sex offenses under section 1170.1, subdivision (a). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-6\">Welfare and Institutions Code section 726 provides in pertinent part: \u201cIn any case in which the minor is removed from the physical custody of his parent or guardian as the result of an order of wardship made pursuant to Section 602, the order shall specify that the minor may not be held in physical confinement for a period <em>in excess of the maximum term of imprisonment which could be imposed upon an adult </em>convicted of the offense or offenses which brought or continued the minor under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court. . . . ffl] If the court elects to aggregate the period of physical confinement on multiple counts, or multiple petitions ... the \u2018maximum term of imprisonment\u2019 shall be specified <em>in accordance with </em>subdivision (a) of Section 1170.1 of the Penal Code.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-7\">Section 1170.1, subdivision (a) provides in pertinent part: \u201c[W]hen any person is convicted of two or more felonies . . . and a consecutive term of imprisonment is imposed under Sections 669 and 1170, the aggregate term of imprisonment. . . shall be the sum of the principal term, the subordinate term, and <em>any additional term imposed pursuant to [inter </em>alia] <em>Section 667.6 </em>. . . .\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-8\">Generally, section 1170.1, subdivision (a) imposes one-third of the mid-range for a \u201csubordinate\u201d consecutive term. By contrast, section 667.6 subdivision (c) provides: \u201cIn lieu of the term provided in Section 1170.1, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1487\">*1487</page-number>full, separate, and consecutive term <em>may </em>be imposed for each\u201d of several specified sex offenses, including rape, forcible oral copulation and penetration by foreign object. (Italics added.) In addition, section 667.6, subdivision (d) <em>requires </em>the court to impose full consecutive sentences for certain sex crimes (including rape, forcible oral copulation and penetration by foreign object) if they involve separate victims or the same victim on separate occasions. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Pena </em>(1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1294, 1317 [9 Cal.Rptr.2d 550].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1267-5\">The juvenile court referee did not specify which subsection he was relying on in calculating full consecutive terms under section 667.6. However, the evidence would support discretionary full consecutive sentences under subdivision (c), as well as mandatory consecutive sentences under subdivision (d) of section <em>667.6.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1267-6\">Appellant contends sentencing under section 667.6 is an \u201calternative\u201d sentencing scheme to the one provided in section 1170.1, subdivision (a), because the first line of section 667.6, subdivision (c) provides that full consecutive terms may be imposed <em>[i]n lieu </em>of the term provided in Section 1170.1, . . .\u201d (Italics added.) (See also <em>People </em>v. <em>Belmontes </em>(1983) 34 Cal.3d 335, 345-346 [193 Cal.Rptr. 882, 667 P.2d 686].) According to appellant, when the court calculated the maximum period of imprisonment on the basis of section 667.6, it violated the directive that an aggregate \u201c \u2018maximum term of imprisonment\u2019 shall be specified <em>in accordance with </em>subdivision (a) of Section 1170.1 of the Penal Code.\u201d (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 726, italics added.) We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1267-7\">In interpreting a statute, a court \u201cshould seek to effectuate the intent of the law, acting in a reasonable fashion to give the statute a sensible construction in accordance with the purpose of the lawmakers, to promote rather than defeat the policy underlying the legislation.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Price) </em>(1984) 150 Cal.App.3d 486, 489 [198 Cal.Rptr. 61].)  Consequently, we must look to the overall purpose of the statute, which, in this case, is to ensure that a minor is not held \u201cin physical confinement for a period <em>in excess of the maximum term of imprisonment which could be imposed upon an </em>adult\u201d for the same offenses. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 726, italics added; <em>In re James A. </em>(1980) 101 Cal.App.3d 332, 338 [161 Cal.Rptr. 588].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1488\">*1488</page-number>If we apply section 667 to determine the maximum aggregate term for multiple sex offenses, we promote the policy underlying Welfare and Institutions Code section 726 because that is how \u201cthe maximum term which could be imposed upon an adult\u201d is calculated. Nothing in Welfare and Institutions Code section 726 requires that we find otherwise.  Although the juvenile court must<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> calculate the maximum term of imprisonment for multiple offenses <em>\u201cin accordance with </em>subdivision (a) of Section 1170.1 of the Penal Code,\" that is precisely what the court did in this case. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 726, italics added.) Section 1170.1, subdivision (a) <em>itself </em>provides that \u201cthe aggregate term of imprisonment. . . shall be the sum of the principal term, the subordinate term, and any additional term imposed pursuant to Section 667, 667.5, <em>667.6, </em>or 12022.1, and pursuant to Section 11370.2 of the Health and Safety Code.\u201d (Italics added.) Thus, to be in accord with section 1170.1, subdivision (a), the court was required to impose full consecutive terms under section 667.6, subdivisions (c) and (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-4\">Nevertheless, appellant argues that the reference to section 667.6 in the quoted language is not to subdivisions (c) and (d), which provide for full consecutive sentencing, but to subdivisions (a) and (b) of section 667.6 which provide for enhancements where a defendant has previously been convicted of a sex offense. The short answer to this contention is: if the Legislature wished to limit section 1170.1 in this manner, it could have easily done so by referring to the specific subsections. Instead, the statute states the \u201caggregate term of imprisonment shall be the sum of the principal term, the subordinate term, and <em>any </em>additional term imposed pursuant to Section . . . 667.6, . . .\" (Italics added.) Significantly, section 667.6, subdivisions (c) and (d) do not describe the terms imposed under those sections as \u201csubordinate\u201d terms; instead, they impose <em>additional </em>terms which are added to the terms calculated under section 1170.1.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1268-5\">In short, the method used by the juvenile court ensured that the minor will not be held \u201cin physical confinement for a period in excess of the maximum term of imprisonment which could be imposed upon an adult\u201d for the same offenses. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 726; <em>In re James A. supra, </em>101 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1489\">*1489</page-number>Cal.App.3d at p. 338.) Moreover, nothing in the statutory scheme prevented the court from relying on subdivisions (c) and (d) of section 667.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b1269-5\">Consequently, we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1269-6\">Merrill, J., and Werdegar, J\u201e concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1269-7\">A petition for a rehearing was denied May 14, 1993, and appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied July 22, 1993.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1265-13\"> Unless otherwise indicated, all further statutory references are to the Penal Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1267-8\"> Whether the referee relied on subdivision (c) or subdivision (d) is irrelevant to our analysis, since the \u201cmaximum period of imprisonment\u201d would be the same under either section.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1268-6\"> Of course, the court is not <em>required </em>to aggregate multiple periods of confinement; however, once it elects to do so it must act in accordance with subdivision (a) of section 1170.1. <em>(In re Jesse F. </em>(1982) 137 Cal.App.3d 164, 168, 170 [186 Cal.Rptr. 841].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1268-7\"> Both subdivisions (c) and (d) provide that the full consecutive sentences imposed \u201cshall be served consecutively to any other term of imprisonment, and shall commence from the time the person would otherwise have been released from imprisonment. The term shall not be included in any determination pursuant to Section 1170.1.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
