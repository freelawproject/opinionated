J.</author>\n<p id=\"b559-14\">I. Introduction</p>\n<p id=\"b559-15\">Petitioner, the City of Los Angeles, seeks a writ of mandate directing the respondent court to grant its motion for summary judgment. Because plaintiffs\u2019 lawsuit and petition for relief from the claims requirement were not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>timely filed, the summary judgment motion should have been granted. Accordingly, the petition is granted.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">II. Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">Plaintiffs Mark and Janette Katz suffered damages to their real and personal property when a city sewer backed up and \u201cflooded the entire house with human waste and other raw sewage.\u201d Plaintiffs alleged in their complaint that this occurred on or about April 9, 1990. On April 5, 1991, plaintiffs submitted to the city a claim for $62,225 in damages to their real and personal property. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 911.2.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On April 19, 1991, the city denied the claim as untimely because it was not filed within six months after the date on which the damage occurred. Plaintiffs were advised that they could seek leave from the city to present a late claim. (\u00a7 911.4.)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">In a letter to the city dated April 26, 1991, plaintiffs asserted that their real property damage claim was timely pursuant to section 911.2 because it was filed within one year after accrual of the claim. Plaintiffs requested leave to file a late claim with respect to personal property damage. The city replied to plaintiffs\u2019 April 26 letter on July 17, 1991. The city agreed that the portion of plaintiffs\u2019 claim dealing with real property damage was timely filed. However, the city denied the real property damage claim on the ground that it had no prior notice of the condition which caused the damage. (\u00a7\u00a7 835, 835.2, 835.4.) The city also denied plaintiffs\u2019 request for leave to file a late claim with respect to the personal property damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">On January 22, 1992, plaintiffs filed this action in the respondent court, seeking general, special, and punitive damages. On the same day, plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>submitted to the respondent court an application pursuant to section 946.6 relieving them from the claims requirement of section 945.4.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>Both the civil suit and the application for relief from the claims requirement were assigned the same case number. The application was granted by Judge Irving Shimer on February 20,1992. A chart detailing the applicable dates is attached as an appendix to this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">On July 1, 1992, the city filed a summary judgment motion on two grounds: with respect to the real property claim, plaintiffs neglected to file their complaint in superior court within the six-month statutory time period set forth in section 945.6, subdivision (a)(1); and as to the personal property losses, they failed to file their petition for relief from the claim filing requirements within six months after their application was denied, as required by section 946.6, subdivision (b).5</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">The respondent court denied the city\u2019s summary judgment motion on September 22, 1992. In its minute order of that date, the court indicated it had denied the motion \u201cto bring the [the] case within [the] theory of Judge Shimer\u2019s order granting relief to file a late claim.\u201d The court further ruled there was a triable issue of fact \u201cas to whether [plaintiffs\u2019] claim was in fact late.\u201d Finally, the court cited the \u201cFarrell case\u201d (referring to <em>Farrell </em>v. <em>County of Placer </em>(1944) 23 Cal.2d 624, 626-631 [145 P.2d 570, 153 A.L.R. 323]), which plaintiffs had cited for the proposition that while compliance with the claims statute was mandatory and a prerequisite to their right to sue, the requirement was \u201cessentially procedural in nature\u201d and not jurisdictional.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">A. <em>Personal Property Losses</em></p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">As a matter of law, plaintiffs did not file their petition for relief from the claims requirement in superior court as to the personal property losses pursuant to section 946.6 in a timely fashion. The time for filing a request to a public entity for permission to present a late claim is a reasonable time not to exceed one year after the accrual of the cause of action. (\u00a7 911.4, subd. (b).) Once the public entity denies the request for permission to present a late claim pursuant to the provisions of section 911.6, a petition challenging the public entity\u2019s decision may be filed in a court. As previously noted, that petition must be filed \u201cwithin six months after the application to the board is denied or deemed denied pursuant to section 911.6.\u201d (\u00a7 946.6, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">In a letter dated July 17, 1991, the city notified plaintiffs that their request for permission to file a late claim as to the personal property losses was denied. Mr. Katz read the July 17, 1991, letter on July 22,1991. Pursuant to section 945.6, subdivision (a)(1), plaintiffs were required to file their petition for relief from the claims requirement in superior court not later than six months after that letter was either personally delivered or deposited in the mail. If the letter was deposited in the mail on July 17, 1991, plaintiffs\u2019 lawsuit, filed January 22, 1992, was untimely. Therefore, the petition was granted by Judge Shimer in violation of the six-month statute of limitations for filing a petition for relief from the claims requirement set forth in section 946.6, subdivision (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-9\">In their opposition to the mandate petition, plaintiffs assert that there is a triable issue of fact as to when the letter was mailed. This is untrue. In support of the motion for summary judgment, Tammy Mar, a senior legal clerk for the city attorney\u2019s office who typed the July 17, 1992, letter, submitted a declaration stating, \u201cWithout any equivocation, any letter regarding a claim prepared by me is placed by me in the United States mail on the date contained on said letter.\u201d Plaintiffs did not present any evidence to contradict this declaration, and in fact plaintiffs have conceded that the six-month period for filing a petition for relief from the claims requirement (\u00a7 946.6) started to run on July 17, 1991. In a declaration supporting his application for relief from the claims requirement, Mr. Katz stated he \u201crelied on the City\u2019s representation in its July 17, 1991, letter that our late claim application was denied as of July 17, 1991,\u201d and he therefore \u201cbelieved that the six month period to file the petition [for relief from the claims filing statute] commenced on July 17, 1991. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b563-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>A motion for summary judgment is an appropriate means for raising the issue of whether a petition pursuant to section 946.6 was timely filed.  The correctness of rulings pursuant to section 946.6 may be challenged by means of a demurrer in the lawsuit filed after relief was granted from the claims requirement and on direct appeal. (See <em>Tuolumne Air Service, Inc. </em>v. <em>Turlock Irrigation Dist. </em>(1978) 87 Cal.App.3d 248, 250-253 [150 Cal.Rptr. 809].)  Two purposes of the summary judgment law are \u201cto penetrate evasive language and adept pleading\u201d <em>(Molko </em>v. <em>Holy Spirit Assn. </em>(1988) 46 Cal.3d 1092, 1107 [252 Cal.Rptr. 122, 762 P.2d 46]) and to \u201c \u2018expedite litigation by avoiding needless trials\u2019 \u201d <em>(Buffalo Arms, Inc. </em>v. <em>Remler Co. </em>(1960) 179 Cal.App.2d 700, 703 [4 Cal.Rptr. 103]).  The intent of the Tort Claims Act \u201cis not to expand the rights of plaintiffs in suits against governmental entities, but to confine potential governmental liability to rigidly delineated circumstances . . . .\u201d <em>(Williams </em>v. <em>Horvath </em>(1976) 16 Cal.3d 834, 838) [129 Cal.Rptr. 453, 548 P.2d 1125]. Permitting a party to utilize a summary judgment motion to attack the timeliness of a petition for relief from the claims requirement pursuant to section 946.6 serves the goals of both bodies of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\">In denying the city\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the respondent court appears to have accepted plaintiffs\u2019 argument that their failure to comply with the statute of limitations for filing a petition for relief from the claims requirement is a procedural, but not jurisdictional, hurdle. <em>(Farrell </em>v. <em>County of Placer, supra, </em>23 Cal.2d at pp. 626-631.) In the portion of <em>Farrell </em>on which plaintiffs rely, the Supreme Court held that the timely filing of a <em>claim </em>was \u201cnothing more than a procedural requirement as to the [government] agency, which, as to the claimant, may be excused by estoppel.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 631). <em>Farrell </em>did not address the issue presented here, which is the timeliness of a petition pursuant to section 946.6. The Court of Appeal has described the procedure for obtaining relief under section 946.6 as follows: \u201cThe procedure set forth in section 946.6 is simply an avenue of relief similar to Code of Civil Procedure section 473 in providing relief from default [citation], and is not designed to resolve the issue of actual compliance with the claim filing requirements.\u201d <em>(Ngo </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles </em>(1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 946, 951 [255 Cal.Rptr. 140].) If the public entity denies an application for leave to file a late claim, the claimant must obtain a court order for relief from the requirements of the claims act before filing suit. Our colleagues in Division Six of this appellate district have noted: \u201cA petition for such an order must be filed with the court within six months after the application is denied or deemed denied. (\u00a7\u00a7 946.6, subd. (b); 911.6.)\u201d <em>(Rason </em>v. <em>Santa Barbara City Housing Authority </em>(1988) 201 Cal.App.3d 817, 823 [247 Cal.Rptr. 492].) The failure to timely comply with the Government Code requirements concerning claims bars a subsequent suit. <em>(City of San </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number><em>Jose </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1974) 12 Cal.3d 447, 454 [115 Cal.Rptr. 797, 525 P.2d 701, 76 A.L.R.3d 1223]; <em>Ridley </em>v. <em>City etc of San Francisco </em>(1969) 272 Cal.App.2d 290, 292 [77 Cal.Rptr. 199].) Here, plaintiffs were required to file their petition pursuant to section 946.6 within six months of July 17, 1991, and they failed to do so. Plaintiffs\u2019 action for recovery of personal property damages is therefore barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">Plaintiffs contend that the respondent court appropriately deferred to Judge Shimer\u2019s ruling that \u201cthe deadline for filing a late claim petition under Section 946.6 is procedural, not jurisdictional.\u201d In our view, plaintiffs have read too much into Judge Shimer\u2019s remarks at the February 20, 1992, hearing. Judge Shimer did not find that the deadline for filing a late claim petition under section 946.6 was \u201cprocedural, not jurisdictional.\u201d Rather, he merely commented in passing that the deadline \u201ccan\u2019t be jurisdictional if it can be waived . . . .\u201d His comments at the hearing indicate that he exercised his discretion to grant plaintiffs\u2019 petition for relief from the claims requirement because they had missed the filing deadline by only five days and the city was \u201cin a lawsuit anyway\u201d with respect to the real property issues.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Judge Shimer did not make any ruling on the issue of whether plaintiffs met the statutory requirements for granting a petition to file a late claim.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">Also, Judge Shimer\u2019s ruling was not entitled to the collateral estoppel effect which the respondent court gave it.  Although an order <em>denying </em>permission to file a late claim is an appealable and final decision which has collateral estoppel effect <em>(County of Los Angeles </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1985) 169 Cal.App.3d 1095, 1100-1101 [215 Cal.Rptr. 699]; <em>Gurrola </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles </em>(1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 145, 151 [200 Cal.Rptr. 157]), an order <em>granting </em>a petition pursuant to section 946.6 for relief from the claims statute is not a final appealable order. <em>(County of Alameda </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1987) 196 Cal.App.3d 619, 622 [242 Cal.Rptr. 215]; <em>Church </em>v. <em>County of Humboldt </em>(1967) 248 Cal.App.2d 855, 857 [57 Cal.Rptr. 79].)  Nonfinal nonappealable orders are subject to reconsideration at any time prior to judgment even in the absence of newly discovered evidence. <em>(Dick </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1986) 185 Cal.App.3d 1159, 1163, fn. 5 [230 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>Cal.Rptr. 297]; accord, <em>Ziller Electronics Lab GmbH </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 1222, 1230 [254 Cal.Rptr. 410].)  Further, in order for a prior ruling to be given collateral estoppel or issue preclusion effect, the question of law or fact must be \u201cactually litigated and determined by a valid and final judgment.\u201d (Rest.2d, Judgments, \u00a7 27; accord, <em>Producers Dairy Delivery Co. </em>v. <em>Sentry Ins. Co. </em>(1986) 41 Cal.3d 903, 910 [226 Cal.Rptr. 558, 718 P.2d 920].) The application for relief from the claims requirement in the present case has not yet resulted in any final judgment. Therefore, the application for relief from the claims requirement was untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\">B. <em>Real Property Losses</em></p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">As to the real property damage, the issue is not as complex or close. The city denied the claim on the merits on July 17, 1991. The written rejection contained an explicit warning as to the six-month period of limitation for filing a lawsuit as required by section 913, subdivision (b). Suit had to be filed within six months of the date the denial was deposited in the mail. (\u00a7 945.6, subd. (a)(1); <em>Anson </em>v. <em>County of Merced </em>(1988) 202 Cal.App.3d 1195, 1200 [249 Cal.Rptr. 457].) Suit was filed January 22, 1992, more than six months or one hundred eighty-two days <em>(Gonzales </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles </em>(1988) 199 Cal.App.3d 601, 604 [245 Cal.Rptr. 112]) after the July 17, 1991, written denial of the real property loss claim. Suit was therefore untimely and the city is entitled to judgment as to the real property losses. <em>(Tubbs </em>v. <em>Southern Cal. Rapid Transit Dist. </em>(1967) 67 Cal.2d 671, 674-679 [63 Cal.Rptr. 377, 433 P.2d 169]; Cal. Government Tort Liability Practice (Cont.Ed.Bar 1992) pp. 825-826.)</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">IV. Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">Let a peremptory writ of mandate issue directing the respondent court to vacate its order of September 22, 1992, denying the motion of defendant City of Los Angeles for summary judgment and enter a new and different order granting the motion. The City of Los Angeles shall recover its costs in connection with proceedings in this court jointly and severally from plaintiffs Mark and Janette Katz.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">Grignon, J., and DeVanon, J.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>Appendix</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">1.
