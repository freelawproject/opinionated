Plaintiffs appeal the judgment. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-4\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-5\">The Helicon Project grew out of County efforts to find a qualified, privately run residential shelter care facility to shelter and treat disturbed or abused minors under its charge. Lacking a facility of its own, the County had previously placed such minors in residential foster homes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-6\">The County in 1988 put out a request for proposals (RFP) describing its facility/program requirements and offering four alternatives. One was for bidders to build facilities, at no cost to the County, on land leased from the County. Another was to do so on privately acquired land. A third was to use existing structures, and a fourth was to use some combination of the others. The RFP expressed the County\u2019s intent to place minors into the facility to the fullest extent possible, contingent on the bidder maintaining adequate programs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-7\">Successful bidder Helicon, Inc. (Helicon), a nonprofit corporation, entered a sublease with the County on September 12, 1989, which is a negotiated version of the first RFP alternative. The County, which held a ground lease on a large tract of undeveloped land, agreed to sublease 5.65 acres of it to Helicon.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The term was for 30 years, with 2 five-year extension options, and Helicon would use the land for \u201cconstructing, operating and maintaining a residential shelter care facility for residents of County who are emotionally disturbed minors . . . .\u201d That use would be consideration for the first 20 years, during which time no rent would be paid. After 20 years, Helicon would pay rent at fair market value.</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1581\">*1581</page-number>Helicon agreed to build at its expense a facility of at least 116 beds plus improvements, including an access road and off-site utilities to serve the project. On-site fixtures and improvements would remain Helicon\u2019s property unless Helicon failed to remove them and restore the premises at the end of the sublease, in which case they would become the County\u2019s.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1353-5\">The sublease initially obligated Helicon to \u201cobtain performance, material and labor, and payment bonds\u201d but was amended in December 1989. Under the amendment, the County would provide up to $75,000 in bond premiums and Helicon would reimburse the County in the event that on-site improvement costs exceeded $5 million. The County in March 1990 paid $70,500 to Insurance Company of the West (ICW) as bond premiums, after the bond language was amended a second time.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1353-6\">Sublease language in the on-site improvements part called attention to and incorporated by reference provisions of the Labor Code, including prevailing-wage sections. It recited that the parties\u2019 execution of the sublease constituted \u201ctheir agreement to abide by\u201d those provisions. Further language in the same paragraph recited that Helicon and its subcontractors \u201cshall comply with\u201d a Labor Code section \u201cregarding apprentices\u201d (\u00a7 1777.5) and that Helicon \u201cshall post\u201d prevailing wage rates during the course of construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-7\">Actual construction was performed under an agreement between Helicon and general contractor Amemar, Inc. (Amemar), a California corporation doing business as Pricor, Inc. (Pricor). Consistent with sublease negotiations, the County absorbed some construction inspection costs on the project rather than charge Helicon for them. Allegedly, prevailing-wage notices were not posted and prevailing wages were not paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1582\">*1582</page-number>A midproject complaint to the Division of Labor Standards Enforcement (DLSE) made by the Center for Control Compliance in July 1990 resulted in a referral to the Director for a coverage determination of whether the project was a public work under section 1720 or 1720.2 and therefore subject to the prevailing wage law. The Director decided against coverage in December 1990, and several plaintiffs herein appealed that determination administratively.</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-4\">Pending the administrative appeal, plaintiffs in April 1991 filed suit against Pricor, Helicon and ICW in the Riverside County Superior Court, seeking, inter alia, damages for breach of contract (based on the sublease references to the prevailing wage law) and asserted statutory obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-5\">The Director issued his written appeal decision in August 1991 based on a record created from stipulated documents. He adhered to the no-coverage decision, rejecting arguments, among others, that the County\u2019s forbearance of rent, payment of surety bond premiums and absorption of inspection expenses were expenditures of \u201cpublic funds\u201d within the meaning of section 1720, subdivision (a). He also ruled that neither that section nor section 1720.2 was implicated by the County\u2019s right to take possession of unremoved improvements at the end of the sublease or by its commitment to pay for services at the facilities.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> He noted the pending contract action but, lacking jurisdiction over the matter, expressed no view.</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-6\">On August 12, plaintiffs challenged the Director\u2019s appeal decision by filing this action for writ of mandate in San Francisco Superior Court against respondent Director and the DIR. Real parties in interest are Pricor, Helicon, Amemar, ICW and the County. On the same day, the superior court in the contract action gave judgment for the defendants, sustaining a demurrer without leave to amend. Plaintiffs appealed to the Court of Appeal, Fourth Appellate District.</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-7\">The mandate action proceeded in San Francisco Superior Court and was heard in February 1992. Newly disclosed facts included an admission that as of October 1991, the County had incurred $14,655 in inspection costs and $27,368.57 in project management costs on the Helicon Project. Also, a third amendment to the sublease, executed in February 1992, had extended the completion date to the end of March 1992 and provided for reimbursement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1583\">*1583</page-number>of the $70,500 bond payment made by the County. The amendment noted that improvement costs had exceeded $5 million and that, by virtue of the first (Dec. 1989) amendment, repayment of bond premiums would be made in 14 monthly installments \u201ccommencing upon placement initially of 40 minors\u201d in the facility. Also available at the time of the hearing was the recent decision in <em>Lusardi Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Aubry </em>(1992) 1 Cal.4th 976 [4 Cal.Rptr.2d 837, 824 P.2d 643] <em>(Lusardi), </em>which provided guidance on public works under the prevailing wage law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-5\">The court denied mandate, finding no abuse of discretion in the coverage decision and of course taking no position on the issues in the pending contract action.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> There was no statement of decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-8\">Plaintiffs petitioned for traditional mandate (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1085) and, alternatively, administrative mandate <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 1094.5). The court ruled that the former applied and that the precise issue, whether stipulated facts showed a public work, posed a question of law.  Respondents and real parties in interest (collectively respondents)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> ask us to employ abuse-of-discretion review using the \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d test applied in administrative mandate cases where a court has exercised its independent judgment on evidence produced at an administrative hearing. <em>(Moran </em>v. <em>Board of Medical Examiners </em>(1948) 32 Cal.2d 301, 308-309 [196 P.2d 20].) Plaintiffs counter that the question is purely legal and that we must therefore not defer to the ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-9\">Plaintiffs have the better argument. The Director ignores his own regulations, which deem his coverage determinations (whether a contract is a public work) quasi-legislative and reviewable by traditional mandate (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 8, \u00a7 16002.5, subd. (a)). This accords with Lusardis holding that the determination \u201ccannot be accurately characterized as \u2018judicial,\u2019 because it does not encompass the conduct of a hearing or a binding order for any type of relief\u201d <em>(Lusardi, supra, </em>1 Cal.4th 976, 993 [rejecting arguments that due process notice rights apply at the agency stage]). It also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1584\">*1584</page-number>accords with prior authority holding that public-works coverage determinations, because they entail interpretations of section 1720, cannot be shielded from mandate review by labeling them discretionary: \u201cInterpretation or construction of a statute is a matter of law; not the exercise of discretionary authority.\u201d <em>(Priest </em>v. <em>Housing Authority </em>(1969) 275 Cal.App.2d 751, 754 [80 Cal.Rptr. 145]; <em>Raley </em>v. <em>California Tahoe Regional Planning Agency </em>(1977) 68 Cal.App.3d 965, 982-983 [137 Cal.Rptr. 699].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-4\">In any event, distinctions between traditional and administrative mandate have little impact on this appeal because, as the trial court correctly observed, the material facts were stipulated, raising a purely legal question of the prevailing wage law\u2019s application to them. We exercise independent judgment in that situation, no matter whether the issue arises by traditional or administrative mandate. <em>(City of Fremont </em>v. <em>Board of Administration </em>(1989) 214 Cal.App.3d 1026, 1030 [263 Cal.Rptr. 164]; <em>City of Coachella </em>v. <em>Riverside County Airport Land Use Com. </em>(1989) 210 Cal.App.3d 1277, 1289 [258 Cal.Rptr. 795].) The parties draw differing conclusions from the documents regarding the intent behind using the prevailing wage references in the sublease, but that dispute bears on the contract action, not this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-6\">The issue here is whether the sublease called for \u201cpublic works\u201d within the meaning of section 1720 or 1720.2.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We agree with the Director and court below that it did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1585\">*1585</page-number>\n<em>Section 1720.2</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-5\">\u201cPublic works\u201d under section 1720.2 means construction work done where (1) the contract is between private persons, (2) the property is privately owned but will have at least 50 percent of its space leased by a public agency after completion and (3) the lease agreement was entered either (a) prior to the construction contract or (b) by completion of the construction if the construction was carried out according to the agency\u2019s plans, specifications or criteria. (See fn. 8, <em>ante.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1357-6\">One obstacle is that the asserted construction contract here is <em>not </em>\u201cbetween private persons\u201d (\u00a7 1720.2, subd. (a)); it is between a private entity and a county. The record refers to an \u201coral contractual arrangement\u201d between Helicon and Pricor (two private entities) for the actual construction, but the precise terms of that \u201ccontract\u201d are not before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-7\">Another obstacle is that there is no lease of space (50 percent or otherwise) by the County (\u00a7 1720.2, subds. (b) &amp; (c)). The only lease agreement is the sublease for the acreage on which the project sits, and section 1720.2 covers a lease of completed facilities, not the underlying land. Moreover, the lessee is Helicon, not the County. The County has committed itself to place minors in the finished facilities but has not agreed in any way to lease the facilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-8\">Section 1720.2 does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-9\">\n<em>Section 1720</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-10\">\u201cPublic works\u201d under section 1720, subdivision (a), means \u201c[cjonstruction . . . done under contract and paid for in whole or in part out of public funds,\u201d and the debate here is whether the sublease called for the payment of \u201cpublic funds\u201d to construct the Helicon Project. We find no such payment in any of the asserted particulars discussed below.</p>\n<p id=\"b1358-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1586\">*1586</page-number>1. <em>Payment for services</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1358-4\">By a memorandum of understanding incorporated in the sublease, the County \u201ccommits\u201d to placing minors in the finished facility and using what are undisputedly public funds to pay for their care and treatment there (fn. 5, <em>ante). </em>However, that is payment for later services, not preliminary construction.  We hold that paying public funds for public services does not make incidental construction work done by a private provider of those services \u201cpublic works\u201d under section 1720, subdivision (a). (2b) The statute requires payment for \u201cconstruction\u201d; to take that as meaning \u201cservices\u201d would violate plain, unambiguous language, which we cannot do. <em>(Rojo </em>v. <em>Kliger </em>(1990) 52 Cal.3d 65, 73 [276 Cal.Rptr. 130, 801 P.2d 373].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1358-5\">It would also clash with case law precedent. In <em>International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers </em>v. <em>Board of Harbor Commissioners </em>(1977) 68 Cal.App.3d 556 [137 Cal.Rptr. 372] <em>(International </em>Brotherhood), a lease providing for a private developer to construct oil and gas facilities on city tidelands, operate them and pay royalties to the city-lessor as consideration was not a public works contract, where the facilities remained the property of the developer for the lease term, removable by the lessee upon termination. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 562.) If that contract for services (development of city resources) fell outside the public-works definition despite private construction needed to provide the services, then so must the contract here. Helicon constructs needed facilities at its expense, assumes all risk of loss in their later operation and retains ownership throughout the lease term, with a right to remove them later (fn. 3, <em>ante). </em>The fact that Helicon has no right to remove off-site road and utility improvements made to serve the project is not a persuasive distinction. Off-site improvements are common to such projects and, of course, are by definition not part of the leased premises on which the service is rendered; they cannot reasonably be deemed part of the contracted-for service.</p>\n<p id=\"b1358-6\">Finally, holding that private construction needed to provide services to a county is enough to create a public work would call into question many services contracts entered, as here (see fn. 2, <em>ante), </em>under the authority of Government Code section 26227.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> That section promotes county alliances with the private sector to secure public services. The Constitution bars <em>gifts </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1587\">*1587</page-number>of \u201cany public money or thing of value\u201d to a private person or entity (Cal. Const, art. XVI, \u00a7 6, 1st par.) and thus demands that payments to a private party serve a public, rather than private, purpose in consideration. <em>(County of Alameda </em>v. <em>Carleson </em>(1971) 5 Cal.3d 730, 745-746 [former art. XIII, \u00a7 25]; <em>City of Oakland </em>v. <em>Garrison </em>(1924) 194 Cal. 298, 301-302 [228 P. 433] [former art. IV, \u00a7 31].) Government Code section 26227 allows a county, on finding a need for programs serving a public purpose, to contract with a nonprofit private entity for those services. In furtherance of that arrangement, it allows a county to make surplus land available for lease or sale <em>and </em>to \u201cfinance or assist in the financing\u201d of the nonprofit group\u2019s acquisition or improvement of it \u201cthrough a lease, installment sale, or other transaction,\u201d all without the county meeting burdensome transfer requirements (fn. 9, <em>ante).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1359-5\">Government Code section 26227 does not mention public works status for such projects, but it is arguably inconsistent to have counties entice private development with lease or sale incentives on the one hand, and then subject such development to the financial disincentive of public works status <em>(Lusardi, supra, </em>1 Cal.4th 976, 987) on the other. Plaintiffs make contrary policy arguments, but those are better addressed to the Legislature <em>(Shalz </em>v. <em>Union School Dist. </em>(1943) 58 Cal.App.2d 599, 607 [137 P.2d 762]), which can carefully craft conditions as it has, for example, in section 1720.2 or in other subdivisions of section 1720 (fn. 8, <em>ante). </em> We read the prevailing wage statute in its present form to exclude from \u201cpublic works\u201d private construction needed to provide the services for which the public entity has contracted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1359-6\">2. <em>Rent forbearance</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1359-7\">Plaintiffs contend that the County\u2019s agreement to forego rent for the first 20 years of the sublease amounts to the payment of public funds for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1588\">*1588</page-number>construction. There does not appear to be any precedent, and the Director\u2019s appeal decision found this issue \u201cthe most difficult\u201d one for that reason. The parties cite cases on the ban against gifts of public funds (see, e.g., <em>Community Television of So. Cal. </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles </em>(1975) 44 Cal.App.3d 990, 996-997 [119 Cal.Rptr. 276]), but they provide a poor analogy. Most importantly, the operative language there is \u201cpublic money <em>or thing of value\u201d </em>(Cal. Const., art. XVI, \u00a7 6, italics added), whereas our statute speaks more narrowly of \u201cpublic funds\u201d (\u00a7 1720, subd. (a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1360-4\">\u201cTo determine the intent of legislation, we first consult the words themselves, giving them their usual and ordinary meaning. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(DaFonte </em>v. <em>Up-Right, Inc. </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 593, 601 [7 Cal.Rptr.2d 238, 828 P.2d 140].)  The full phrase here is \u201cpaid for in whole or in part out of public funds\u201d (\u00a7 1720, subd. (a)). Does it encompass the forbearance of rent?  The verb \u201cpay,\u201d standing alone, can in its usual and ordinary sense include the transfer of things other than money. It means \u201cto satisfy (someone) for services rendered or property delivered\u201d or to \u201cdischarge an obligation\u201d; \u201cPay is a general term, usu[ally] lacking particular connotation but sometimes bluntly stressing the purchase of services . . . .\u201d (Webster\u2019s Third New Internal. Diet. (1965) p. 1659.) Even \u201c[i]n a more restricted legal sense[,] payment is the performance of a duty promise, or obligation ... by the delivery of money or other value\u201d\u2014\u201cthe delivery of money or its equivalent. . . .\u201d (Black\u2019s Law Diet. (6th ed. 1990) p. 1129.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1360-5\">However, the \u201cpayment\u201d here must be \u201cout of public funds\u201d (\u00a7 1720, subd. (a)). The word \u201cfunds\u201d is not specially defined in the statute but \u201chas a well-established meaning in common parlance .... The dictionary defines it as \u2018available pecuniary resources ordinarily including cash and negotiable paper\u2019 [citation], and in a legal context the courts have also taken it to include property of value which may be converted into cash [citations].\u201d <em>(Keene </em>v. <em>Keene </em>(1962) 57 Cal.2d 657, 663 [21 Cal.Rptr. 593, 371 P.2d 329].) The county\u2019s right to charge rent is not an available pecuniary resource like cash or some readily cash-convertible asset. To take rent <em>collected </em>from one source and use it to pay obligations would plainly be a payment of public funds, but the County here will not collect the rent. Nor, according to our record, will it lose appreciable rents it otherwise might have charged for the acreage in its unimproved state. Also, it may be more accurate to view uncharged rent over 20 years as an ongoing subsidy of contracted-for <em>services </em>rather than initial <em>construction. </em>The contract originally envisioned only a year of construction, during which time, of course, the commercial value of the land would be at its lowest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1360-6\">The forbearance of rent here, while valuable as a negotiating tool in securing the total project, does not fit comfortably into the idea of \u201cconstruction\u201d \u201cpaid for . . . out of public funds.\u201d Plaintiffs attribute the ill fit to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1589\">*1589</page-number>changing times: words which were easy to apply when counties contracted for projects directly have become awkward in a post-Proposition 13 age when cash-poor counties turn increasingly to alliances with private industry. In plaintiffs\u2019 view, we must expand the meaning of anachronistic language to fit the realities of the present, or risk frustrating legislative intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1361-5\">We view the situation differently.  Courts will liberally construe prevailing wage statutes <em>(Walker </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles </em>(1961) 55 Cal.2d 626, 634-635 [12 Cal.Rptr. 671, 361 P.2d 247]; <em>Cassaretto </em>v. <em>San Francisco </em>(1936) 18 Cal.App.2d 8, 10 [62 P.2d 777]), but they cannot interfere where the Legislature has demonstrated the ability to make its intent clear and chosen not to act <em>(Peralta Community College Dist. </em>v. <em>Fair Employment &amp; Housing Com. </em>(1990) 52 Cal.3d 40, 50 [276 Cal.Rptr. 114, 801 P.2d 357]).  We do not share plaintiffs\u2019 view that the Legislature has overlooked changes in county needs or practices in this area. It has in fact been active. It last amended Government Code section 26227 in 1991 (fn. 9, <em>ante) </em>and has regularly amended the prevailing wage law to keep pace with evolving realities. Section 1720.2 was such a reaction, as was the 1989 addition of section 1720.4 and subdivision (f) of section 1720 (see fn. 8, <em>ante). </em>Those balanced solutions show current awareness by the Legislature. We adhere to the plain meaning of section 1720, subdivision (a), and decline to read it more expansively.</p>\n<p id=\"b1361-6\">3. <em>Inspection costs</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1361-7\">The same reasons compel us to reject plaintiffs\u2019 view that the County\u2019s absorption of certain inspection costs was a payment for construction with public funds. County supervisors decided early on that their building services department would \u201cprovide compliance and quality construction inspection services to assure that the facility is built in accordance with plans, specifications and Building Codes\u201d; costs up to $9,000 would be \u201ccharged\u201d to the department of public social services. The later-signed sublease does not mention the costs, but the County admitted in superior court that it had absorbed about $42,000 in inspection and \u201cproject management\u201d costs by mid-October 1991. The parties debate which amount is pertinent (i.e., what the Director knew or what the court knew), but we do not regard the amount as important. The <em>nature </em>of the costs is important, and is undisputed. The County waived costs it normally charges for routine inspections and allocated them between departments for internal accounting purposes. The $42,000 apparently includes partial salaries for the County employees involved, but there is no suggestion that extra people were hired to absorb the work. \u201cProject management\u201d evidently did not involve construction supervision, as the term might imply.</p>\n<p id=\"b1362-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1590\">*1590</page-number>We hold that the cost waivers were not public funds paid for construction (\u00a7 1720, subd. (a)). Like the forbearance of rent, these \u201ccosts\u201d involve no payment of funds out of county coffers. Legislators could easily express an intent to bring waived costs (or rent) within the concept of payment with \u201cpublic funds\u201d but have not done so. A holding that waived inspection costs are partial payments from public funds could make public works of any project where a county has used cost waivers as incentives to development, even though the project may serve purely private needs. The statute gives no warning that this result was intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b1362-4\">4. <em>Bond premiums</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1362-5\">The County spent $70,500 to pay performance and payment bond premiums on the project. There is no dispute that this was a use of \u201cpublic funds.\u201d However, both the Director and apparently the court below concluded that the money was in essence a loan, not a payment, because Helicon agreed to reimburse the County once on-site improvements exceeded $5 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b1362-6\">We conclude that Helicon did obligate itself at all pertinent times to reimburse the County for premiums paid should the $5 million mark be reached. Plaintiffs\u2019 contrary view is built on an unreasonable reading of the sublease amendments.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>\n                   We also conclude that a loan of public funds to finance bond premiums during private construction is not construction \u201cpaid for\u201d with public funds under section 1720, subdivision (a). The public agency is not ultimately paying for the bond; the builder is.  This is logical and accords with the Director\u2019s prior rulings. We do not find significant the fact that the loan here may have been interest free. Interest not charged is like rent or fees not charged, and we have no evidence showing, in any event, that the County lost interest it otherwise would have earned with those funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b1363-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1591\">*1591</page-number>The main dispute is whether the improvements would or did exceed $5 million. The sublease used language of condition, providing for reimbursement \u201c[i]n the event\u201d the improvements exceeded $5 million. A May 1991 letter states that Helicon at first obtained and paid for a letter of credit in the amount of $5 million but that, when the County insisted on bonds, the matter was resolved by Helicon posting its letter of credit and the County paying the bond premiums. This does not illuminate whether improvements were expected to exceed $5 million, nor does the figure itself, which may have had to do with statutory thresholds rather than cost projections.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1363-5\">On that record, the Director concluded that \u201c[t]he County, in essence, lent money to the lessee/contractor in the form of payment for performance bonds until a finished product was left on the land, and it was, thereafter, reimbursed for the sum loaned. . . .\u201d Plaintiffs correctly note that there was no showing then that reimbursement had been made or that the $5 million cost threshold had been reached.</p>\n<p id=\"b1363-6\">The first evidence was the third sublease amendment, which was executed <em>after </em>the Director\u2019s appeal decision and introduced only in the superior court. The amendment reflects that costs had exceeded $5 million and that Helicon would start reimbursing the County in monthly installments of $5,000 once the first 40 minors were placed in the facility.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The court apparently relied on the amendment.  Plaintiffs claim error, urging that anything not before the Director was irrelevant and that the amendment was a self-serving \u201cploy\u201d casting \u201cno meaningful light\u201d on the parties\u2019 intent months earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b1364-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1592\">*1592</page-number>No error occurred. \u201cIn an action for administrative mandamus, the court reviews the administrative record, receiving additional evidence only if that evidence was unavailable at the time of the administrative hearing, or improperly excluded from the record. [Citation.] In a traditional mandamus action, on the other hand, the court is not limited to review of the administrative record, but may receive additional evidence. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(No Oil, Inc. </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(1974) 13 Cal.3d 68, 79, fn. 6 [118 Cal.Rptr. 34, 529 P.2d 66].) \u201c[A] judge hearing a mandamus proceeding may properly consider ... all relevant evidence, including facts not existing until after the petition for writ of mandate was filed. This is so because mandamus is an action where equitable principles apply [citations], and because issuance of the writ is frequently a matter for the court\u2019s discretion [citations].\u201d <em>(Bruce </em>v. <em>Gregory </em>(1967) 65 Cal.2d 666, 670-671 [56 Cal.Rptr. 265, 423 P.2d 193].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1364-4\">The court below observed that this case posed a legal question of the application of stipulated facts to the law, but the court was also clearly aware that one factual question was unresolved\u2014whether the contingency triggering Helicon\u2019s duty to reimburse had occurred. The third amendment proved that occurrence: the project\u2019s on-site improvements had exceed $5 million, making Helicon obligated to repay the bond premiums. Plaintiffs\u2019 concerns about self-serving new evidence (cf. <em>Laurel Heights Improvement Assn. </em>v. <em>Regents of University of California </em>(1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 394 [253 Cal.Rptr. 426, 764 P.2d 278] [rejecting postaction environmental review as <em>\u201cpost hoc </em>rationalizations to support action already taken\u201d]) are misplaced. We have held, contrary to their claim, that Helicon was conditionally bound under the first sublease amendment to reimburse the County at all relevant times (fn. 10, <em>ante). </em>That conclusion is established as a matter of law from the stipulated documents, making the third amendment\u2019s \u201cintent\u201d value superfluous. The important question was whether the cost-threshold condition had occurred. If it had, there was no need for issuance of the writ, regardless of how the matter may have appeared to the Director earlier. (Cf. <em>Felt </em>v. <em>Waughop </em>(1924) 193 Cal. 498, 503-505 [225 P. 862] [city clerk not mandated to place name of candidate on ballot where evidence disclosed in the writ action showed the candidate unqualified to hold office].) Plaintiffs opposed admitting the amendment below on the procedural grounds urged here but did not try to show that the costs had in fact <em>not </em>reached $5 million. The evidence is uncontradicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1364-5\">Plaintiffs suggest that reimbursement was conditional even after the third amendment because there would first have to be 40 minors placed in the facility, but they are mistaken. The duty to reimburse was fixed upon the project reaching the cost threshold of $5 million, and that is what determines the loan/payment distinction. Placement of the 40 minors simply determines <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1593\">*1593</page-number><em>when </em>reimbursement will occur (fn. 12, <em>ante). </em>Also, placement does not rest entirely within the County\u2019s control. The memorandum of understanding grants the County a \u201cright of first refusal to any available bed in the facility\u201d but allows Helicon to accept private placements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1365-5\">Because the judgment is valid based on bond premiums being a loan rather than a payment for construction, we do not reach respondents\u2019 alternative argument that a payment of bond premiums in these circumstances should be viewed, under a risk-of-loss analysis (cf. <em>International Brotherhood, supra, </em>68 Cal.App.3d 556, 562), as a permitted expenditure for insurance against loss by a lessor/county, even if never reimbursed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1365-6\">5. <em>Cumulative effect</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1365-7\"><em>A </em>theme recurrent in plaintiffs\u2019 briefing is that aspects of this case (rent forbearance, inspection costs, bond premiums, public purpose) have a \u201ccumulative\u201d effect warranting public-works status even if the individual aspects do not. We reject that approach as unworkable. Parties must be able to predict the public-works consequences of their actions under reasonably precise criteria and clear precedent. Subdivision (a) of section 1720 would become a quagmire under plaintiffs\u2019 approach, the only certain result being constant litigation. The Legislature has formulated precise criteria tailored to many situations in this area (fn. 8, <em>ante) </em>and is uniquely suited to balance and address the several policy concerns raised here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1365-8\">Plaintiffs see in this case an attempt to circumvent the prevailing wage law in contravention of statute and policy, as was found in <em>Lusardi. </em>We disagree. A hospital district in <em>Lusardi </em>spent $18 million to expand a public hospital. To save money, it tried to avoid public-work status by contracting with a private developer for the construction, having the contract designate itself the developer\u2019s agent, contracting as \u201cagent\u201d with a contractor for the construction and representing to the contractor that the project was not a public work. <em>(Lusardi, supra, </em>1 Cal.4th 976, 982-983.) The district argued that the prevailing wage law should apply only if a contract calls for its application; the Supreme Court rejected that interpretation as encouraging awarding bodies and contractors to circumvent the law and its objectives. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 987-988.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1365-9\">Here, by contrast, the project was privately financed, the County would not own or run the facilities, and the County acted under the authority of Government Code section 26227 in both contracting for services and offering the sublease and rent forbearance. Far from misrepresenting anything, the County put prevailing-wage provisions in the sublease and took a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1594\">*1594</page-number>tentative position below that there was at least a contractual obligation for Helicon to comply with them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1366-4\">Plaintiffs find circumvention of a sort in that the sublease provides that the facilities may become the County\u2019s if not removed at the end of the sublease term (fn. 3, <em>ante). </em>We find no bad faith or circumvention in the provision. Section 1720 does not remotely address that kind of future contingency. Moreover, the County has merely acknowledged its sublessee\u2019s right of removal once the sublease terminates (see 4 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (9th ed. 1987) Real Property, \u00a7\u00a7 618-619, pp. 803-805), and the County, as primary leaseholder, should be expected to contract for control of unremoved improvements in case it is bound under its own lease to restore the premises to their former condition someday (see <em>id., </em>\u00a7 620, p. 805). These matters may or may not merit legislative attention, but the law currently does not cover them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1366-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b1366-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1366-7\">Kline, P.

The first amendment added two sentences, the first obligating the County to pay up to $75,000 in premiums and the second conditionally obligating Helicon to reimburse the County. The second amendment, executed shortly before the County paid premiums, amended and replaced \u201cthe last sentence\u201d of paragraph 6(a). It incorporated ICW bond forms by reference and limited the needed surety to performance and payment bonds.</p>\n<p id=\"b1362-8\">Plaintiffs contend that \u201cthe last sentence\u201d replaced by the second amendment was the last (second) sentence <em>of the first amendment, </em>thereby removing Helicon\u2019s duty to reimburse. Obviously, that was not intended. Unless \u201cthe last sentence\u201d is read as referring to the <em>original </em>(and still intact) last sentence of the paragraph, the amendment makes no sense. It would leave two conflicting descriptions of the kinds of bonds required. The second amendment was clearly meant to supplant the original reference to \u201cmaterial and labor\u201d bonds, not to eliminate the reimbursement duty.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1363-7\"> The actual bonds are not in the record, but the ICW drafts attached to the first amendment cite public-works bond provisions (Civ. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 3181, 3247-3252), the County perhaps thinking that they would or might apply. The threshold figure of $5 million for reimbursement appears correlated to Civil Code section 3248, which calls for payment bonds in a sum equal to one-half the total amounts payable on projects of $5 million or less (subd. (a)(1)) but only one-fourth value for projects between $5 million and $10 million (subd. (a)(2)). This implies that reimbursement would start if the project reached the less costly bond threshold of $5 million but does not explain how likely that contingency was.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1363-8\"> We reject any concern about the third amendment not being fully executed. The court had a copy executed only by Helicon but also had a Helicon officer's declaration claiming personal knowledge that the amendment had been executed by both parties. The court was entitled to rely on the declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b1363-9\">The amendment states in part: \u201cSublease [szc] represents that the cost of the improvements referred to in Paragraph 6(a) of the Sublease exceeded the sum of $5,000,000, and that by virtue of the provisions contained in the First Amendment to Sublease, Sublessee is obligated to reimburse County the sum of $70,500 which represents the premium paid by County to the surety, Insurance Company of the West. Sublessee agrees to make such reimbursement in fourteen (14) monthly installments . . . and such installments shall be payable on the first day of the month commencing upon placement initially of 40 minors within the residential shelter care facility. Sublessee further agrees to notify County\u2019s Director of General Services Agency and Director of Department of Social Services forthwith, in writing, when such placement occurs.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
