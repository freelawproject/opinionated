Corporation (HFS; collectively, the Highland defendants). The court found the complaint failed to state a cause of action for Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961 et seq.) violations, fraud or fraudulent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1698\">*1698</page-number>concealment. The court further found the entire complaint, except the RICO cause of action, was barred by federal preemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b1448-4\">Because the trial court erred in finding no cause of action was stated and the doctrine of federal preemption barred the state claims, we reverse the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1448-5\">Factual Statement</p>\n<p id=\"b1448-6\">1. <em>The Parties</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1448-7\">Plaintiffs consist of the People of the State of California (People) and numerous individuals in their individual capacity and as guardians ad litem and on behalf of a class who resided in one or more of the subject slum Los Angeles City buildings (tenant plaintiffs).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1448-8\">The defendants who are parties to this appeal are Highland, Karmelich (its president), Pratt (its loan coordinator and vice-president), and HFS (its wholly owned subsidiary).</p>\n<p id=\"b1449-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1699\">*1699</page-number>Highland, a federally chartered savings and loan institution, specializes in making loans to owners of residential properties, including slum buildings in the greater Los Angeles area. Eight of the eleven slum properties listed in this complaint were financed by defendant Highland. Karmelich is both its president and chief executive officer. Karmelich also served as secretary of the board of directors of defendant Northeast. Pratt is a vice-president and loan coordinator for defendant Highland. Pratt helped Highland facilitate the rapid transfer of record ownership of slum buildings. She was also actively engaged in soliciting and arranging for uncreditworthy borrowers to assume Highland loans on those slum buildings without regard to the borrowers\u2019 ability to maintain and repair the buildings. HFS is a California corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of defendant Highland.  Among its activities is the servicing of loans made by defendant Highland.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1449-5\">2. <em>Nature of Charging Allegations</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1449-6\">In this action plaintiffs seek to hold the Highland defendants responsible for the continuing slum conditions of certain buildings. In addition to monetary damages and penalties the complaint seeks injunctive relief.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1450-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1700\">*1700</page-number>The thrust of the complaint charges Highland with engaging in unfair business practices and fraud for the purpose of maximizing its profits. Such goal was achieved by creating a situation where rents, which were collectable only if the units complied with the habitability laws, were generated without the expenditure of sums necessary to ensure such compliance. Thus, the slum nature of the buildings was perpetuated and the tenant plaintiffs were defrauded of their right to a habitable dwelling.</p>\n<p id=\"b1450-4\">Essentially, Highland allegedly committed such illegal activities through fraudulent loan transactions in order to avoid criminal and civil liability. Highland hid and exercised its control over the subject buildings by setting up record owners who had only token or no investment in the buildings, i.e., either such owners had insufficient asserts or lacked bona fide business qualifications to obtain the loans. In general, title to the buildings was worthless since the amount of the loans exceeded the fair market value of the security. The record owners therefore were \u201cstrawmen\u201d who were basically managers of the buildings for Highland\u2019s benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1450-5\">It is further alleged that Highland in effect was the true beneficial owner of the buildings because it determined who would be the record owner and when the owner failed to perform, Highland replaced him or her with another whom it could control. Such transfers of record ownership also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1701\">*1701</page-number>served to complicate and frustrate civil and criminal prosecution for violation of the habitability law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1451-5\">It was also alleged that Highland routinely facilitated the title transfer of the buildings without the exercise of the due-on-sale clauses of the loan agreements, without requiring loan assumption by creditworthy individuals, and without scrutiny to ensure necessary repairs were made. Highland charged loan points and interest at a rate higher than those for bona fide loan transactions and utilized the entire or almost entire loan amount from the new record owner to pay off the principal, interest, penalties and arrearages owed by the former record holder. Such loans were often arranged by lender-related defendants controlled by and/or associated with Highland. Highland then allowed or caused the fraudulent documents to be recorded in order to hide their control.</p>\n<p id=\"b1451-6\">Finally, it was alleged the above pattern of activity by Highland was outside of and inconsistent with the normal and standard practice of lenders.</p>\n<p id=\"b1451-7\">Procedural Statement</p>\n<p id=\"b1451-8\">This action was filed on March 28, 1989. On June 7, 1990, a second amended complaint asserting numerous causes of action was filed, including those for RICO violations, fraud and fraudulent concealment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1452-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1702\">*1702</page-number>On August 6, 1990, Highland defendants filed demurrers to that complaint. They also filed a companion motion to strike. On or about October 19, 1990, plaintiffs filed joint opposition. On or about November 13, 1990, Highland defendants filed their reply.</p>\n<p id=\"b1452-4\">On January 25, 1991, the court sustained certain demurrers without leave to amend. The court sustained demurrers without leave to amend as to all causes of action, except the second for RICO violations, on the ground of failure to state a cause of action (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 430.10, subd. (e)) because of federal preemption. As authority it relied on section 545.2 of title 12 of the Code of Federal Regulations; <em>Fidelity Federal Savings and Loan </em>v. <em>De La Cuesta </em>(1982) 458 U.S. 141, 162 [73 L.Ed.2d 664, 680-681, 102 S.Ct. 3014]; and <em>Wisconsin League of Financial Institutions </em>v. <em>Galecki </em>(W.D.Wis. 1989) 707 F.Supp. 401, 405.</p>\n<p id=\"b1452-5\">The court further sustained demurrers without leave to amend on the ground of failure to state a cause of action (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 430.10, subd. (e)) specifically as to the 2d cause of action (RICO), the 11th cause of action for fraud, and the 12th cause of action for fraudulent concealment. The court also sustained uncertainty demurrers to the entirety of the complaint with leave to amend. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 430.10, subd. (f)-) The motion to strike was placed off calendar.</p>\n<p id=\"b1452-6\">On March 15, 1991, the court entered the order (judgment) of dismissal based on the sustaining of the demurrers of the Highland defendants without leave to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b1452-7\">Issues Presented</p>\n<p id=\"b1452-8\">This appeal presents three basic issues: (1) Are the state claims against Highland, a federal savings and loan association, preempted by federal law? (2) If so, does federal preemption also bar the action against Karmelich, Highland\u2019s president, Pratt, its loan coordinator and a vice-president, and HFS, its wholly owned subsidiary? (3) Does the complaint state a cause of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1703\">*1703</page-number>action against the Highland defendants for RICO violations, fraud, or fraudulent concealment?</p>\n<p id=\"b1453-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1453-6\">1. <em>Action Against Highland Not Barred by Federal Preemption Under </em>HOLA<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1453-7\">a. <em>Principles Applicable to Determination of Preemption</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1453-8\">\u201cPreemption issues are resolved through the process of statutory interpretation. [Citation.] We look to the language of the statute and to the intent of Congress.\u201d <em>(Siegel </em>v. <em>American Savings &amp; Loan Assn. </em>(1989) 210 Cal.App.3d 953, 959 [258 Cal.Rptr. 746].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1453-9\">\u201c \u2018In determining whether a state statute [or a state cause of action] is pre-empted by federal law and therefore invalid under the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution, our sole task is to ascertain the intent of Congress. . . . First, when acting within constitutional limits, Congress is empowered to pre-empt state law by so stating in express terms. Second, congressional intent to pre-empt state law in a particular area may be inferred where the scheme of federal regulation is sufficiently comprehensive to make reasonable the inference that Congress \u201cleft no room\u201d for supplementary state regulation. . . . H] As a third alternative, in those areas where Congress has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1704\">*1704</page-number>not completely displaced state regulation, federal law may nonetheless preempt state law to the extent it actually conflicts with federal law. Such a conflict occurs either because \u201ccompliance with both federal and state regulations is a physical impossibility,\u201d or because the state law stands \u201cas an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.\u201d  Nevertheless, pre-emption is not to be lightly presumed.\u2019 <em>(California Federal S. &amp; L. Assn. </em>v. <em>Guerra </em>(1987) 479 U.S. 272, 280-281 [93 L.Ed.2d 613, 623, 107 S.Ct. 683], citations omitted.)  In <em>R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. </em>v. <em>Durham County </em>(1986) 479 U.S. 130, 149 [93 L.Ed.2d 449, 467, 107 S.Ct. 499], the court stated: \u2018Although the regulations are not themselves controlling on the pre-emption issue, where, as in this case, Congress has entrusted an agency with the task of promulgating regulations to carry out the purposes of a statute, as part of the pre-emption analysis we must consider whether the regulations evidence a desire to occupy a field completely. Pre-emption should not be inferred, however, simply because the agency\u2019s regulations are comprehensive.\u2019 (Citations omitted.)\u201d <em>(Siegel </em>v. <em>American Savings &amp; Loan Assn., supra, </em>210 Cal.App.3d at pp. 958-959.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1454-4\">b. <em>No Express Preemption Under HOLA Except as to Two Items</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1454-5\">HOLA is the acronym of the federal Home Owners\u2019 Loan Act of 1933 (12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1461 et seq.).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201c\u2018The language of HOLA, as well as the history that lies behind its enactment, demonstrate that there is a strong federal interest in the uniform treatment of the federally chartered savings and loans associations. Congress initially enacted HOLA and its regulatory structure in response to a crisis in the nation\u2019s private home financing system. [Citation.] This crisis had developed at least in part as a result of the inconsistent and ill-advised practices of the various states. As noted by the Ninth Circuit, \u201cthe states had developed a hodgepodge of savings and loan laws and regulations, and Congress hoped that [the Federal Home Loan Bank Board\u2019s] rules would set an example for uniform and sound savings and loan regulations.\u201d[<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>] <em>(Conference of Federal Savings &amp; Loan Ass\u2019ns </em>v. <em>Stein, </em>604 F.2d 1256, 1258, (9th Cir. 1979), <em>summarily affd., </em>445 U.S. 921, 100 S.Ct. 1304, 63 L.Ed.2d 754 (1980), <em>citing </em>T.

Section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1705\">*1705</page-number>545.1 of 12 C.F.R., which specifies the general parameters of the association\u2019s authority, provides: \u201cA Federal savings association may exercise all authority granted it by [HOLA] and its charter and bylaws, whether or not implemented specifically by Office regulations, subject to the limitations and interpretations contained in this part.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1455-5\">Section 545.2 of 12 C.F.R. provides: \u201c \u2018The regulations in this Part 545 are promulgated pursuant to the plenary and exclusive authority of the Board to regulate all aspects of the operations of Federal associations, as set forth in section 5(a) of the Home Owners\u2019 Loan Act of 1933, 12 U.S.C. 1464, as amended.

Sav. &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n </em>(S.D.Cal. 1951) 98 F.Supp. 311 is not \u201ca case strikingly parallel in material respects to this case.\u201d In <em>Coast </em>\u201c[t]he gravamen of the complaint is that through signs and other means of advertising, defendant [federal association] has transacted business in the manner of a bank and has held itself out as a bank or savings bank, and has led the public to believe that it was such a bank, without authority and in violation of state statutes.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Coast Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n, supra, </em>98 F.Supp at p. 315.) Former section 161.7(e) of title 24 of the Code of Federal Regulations expressly governed the subject of advertising vis-\u00e1-vis federal associations. (98 F.Supp. at p. 315, fn. 5.) In view of such regulation the court held the board had primary jurisdiction over the subject matter. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 317.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1457-5\">In contrast, this case does not involve a direct conflict between a specific regulation and state law. Reliance by the Highland defendants on <em>Fidelity Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>De La Cuesta </em>and <em>Wisconsin League of Financial Inst </em>v. <em>Galecki </em>is misplaced for that same reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b1457-6\">In <em>De La Cuesta </em>the United States Supreme Court held the board\u2019s regulation of due-on-sale clauses preempted state law as embodied in <em>Wellenkamp </em>v. <em>Bank of America </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 943 [582 P.2d 970]. <em>(Fidelity Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>De La Cuesta, supra, </em>458 U.S. 141, 159 [73 L.Ed.2d 664, 678-679].) The <em>De La Cuesta </em>court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1457-7\">\u201c[T]he Board\u2019s intent to pre-empt the <em>Wellenkamp </em>doctrine is unambiguous. The due-on-sale regulation plainly provides that a federal savings and loan \u2018continues to have the power\u2019 to include a due-on-sale clause in a loan instrument and to enforce that clause \u2018at its option.\u2019 12 CFR \u00a7 545.8-3(f) (1982). The California courts, in contrast, have limited a federal association\u2019s right to exercise a due-on-sale provision to those cases where the lender can demonstrate that the transfer has impaired its security. M] The conflict does not evaporate because the Board\u2019s regulation simply permits, but does not compel, federal savings and loans to include due-on-sale clauses in their contracts and to enforce those provisions when the security property is transferred. ... In addition, <em>Wellenkamp </em>explicitly bars a federal savings and loan from exercising a due-on-sale clause to adjust a long-term mortgage\u2019s interest rate toward current market rates\u2014a due-on-sale practice the Board has approved . . . .\u201d (458 U.S. at pp. 155-156 [73 L.Ed.2d 676-677], italics in original.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1457-8\">In <em>Wisconsin League of Financial Inst. </em>v. <em>Galecki, supra, </em>the court held the \u201cBoard has expressly preempted state regulation in the area of mortgage escrow accounts and loan disclosures.\u201d (707 F.Supp. at p. 405.) The court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1708\">*1708</page-number>expressly limited its holding the facts of that case by announcing: \u201cThe court need not determine the full breadth of the term \u2018operations of a federal Association\u2019 [as provided in section 545.2] because there can be no dispute that such phrase extends at least to the regulation of mortgage escrow accounts and mortgage loan disclosures. <em>Fidelity Federal, </em>458 U.S. at 167 . . . <em>Kaski </em>v. <em>First Federal Savings &amp; Loan Association, </em>72 Wis.2d 132, 240 N.W.2d 367 (1976).\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> (707 F.Supp. at p. 405.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1458-4\">It is undisputed that this case involves neither the regulation by state law of advertising, enforceability of due-on-sale clauses, or mortgage escrow accounts and mortgage loan disclosures. Accordingly, the <em>Coast, De La Cuesta, </em>and <em>Galecki </em>cases are of no moment with regard to whether the subject state causes of action are expressly preempted by HOLA and its concomitant regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1458-5\">\u201cPreemption of state law by federal regulation is not favored. We will not find express preemption unless a regulation clearly so states. <em>(Chicago &amp; N. W. Tr. Co. </em>v. <em>Kalo Brick &amp; Tile Co. </em>(1981) 450 U.S. 311, 317 [67 L.Ed.2d 258, 265, 101 S.Ct. 1124].) It is the burden of the party claiming preemption to prove it. <em>(Elsworth </em>v. <em>Beech Aircraft Corp. </em>(1984) 37 Cal.3d 540, 548 [208 Cal.Rptr. 874, 691 P.2d 630]; <em>Perdue </em>v. <em>Crocker National Bank </em>(1985) 38 Cal.3d 913, 937 [216 Cal.Rptr. 345, 702 P.2d 503].)\u201d <em>(Siegel </em>v. <em>American Savings &amp; Loan Assn., supra, </em>210 Cal.App.3d at p. 960.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1458-6\">As pointed out in <em>Siegel, </em>\u201c[t]he Board is capable of saying it means to expressly preempt all state law in an area. . . . Section 545.2 [of 12 C.F.R.] contains no such statement that federal law is preemptive of all state common law claims.\u201d (210 Cal.App.3d at pp. 960-961.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1458-7\">Similarly, we have found no provision of HOLA nor any particular regulation, and none have been cited to us, which expressly preempt the statutory action by the People for unfair business practices and the causes of action by the tenant plaintiffs for fraud, RICO violations, etc. We therefore hold the subject action is not explicitly barred by federal preemption pursuant to HOLA.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1458-8\">Nonetheless, we do find federal preemption with regard to two matters. First, the allegation that Highland charged loan \u201cpoints and provided for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1709\">*1709</page-number>interest, each of which was higher than the rates for bona fide loan[ ] transactions\u201d impinges on the specific intent of Congress to preempt state usury laws,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and thus, improperly delves into an area expressly preempted by HOLA. (See, e.g., \u00a7 1463(g).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1459-5\">The second matter concerns item (3)(h) of the complaint\u2019s prayer which seeks to enjoin the Highland defendants from \u201c[djeclining to initiate and complete foreclosure as speedily as the law permits on substandard property of which the lender has notice if the substandard conditions are not fully corrected within 120 days, provided that foreclosure proceedings may terminate if correction occurs before foreclosure is completed.\u201d This requested relief is in direct conflict with 12 C.F.R. section 545.34 which permits a federal association \u201cat its option [to] declare immediately due and payable\u201d the secured indebtedness upon an unconsented to transfer of title to the real property.</p>\n<p id=\"b1459-6\">On remand, the court is therefore directed to strike such allegations and prayer requests. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 436.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1459-7\">c. <em>No Implied Preemption Under HOLA</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1459-8\">Alternatively, the Highland defendants assert the subject action is barred by the doctrine of implied preemption. They urge federal law has impliedly \u201coccupied the field\u201d of federal savings and loan associations with regard to their operations and functions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1459-9\">We acknowledge HOLA and the regulations promulgated thereunder have created both a comprehensive and uniform thrift system which is federally regulated and that in exercising its broad authority the former board has issued specific, detailed regulations governing those associations. Nonetheless, we observe the United States Supreme Court has declined to conclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1710\">*1710</page-number>the board has preempted all lending practices or that the Board\u2019s discretion is limitless.</p>\n<p id=\"b1460-4\">In <em>De La Cuesta </em>the court construed the board\u2019s powers to be plenary over federal associations: \u201cThe broad language of \u00a7 5(a) [of HOLA] expresses no limits on the Board\u2019s authority to regulate the lending practices of federal savings and loans. . . . [Thus,] *[i]t would have been difficult for Congress to give the Bank Board a broader mandate.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Fidelity Federal Savings and Loan </em>v. <em>De La Cuesta, supra, </em>458 U.S. at p. 161 [73 L.Ed.2d at p. 680].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1460-6\">However, the court expressly declined to find the board had preempted state law as to all lending practices and cautioned: \u201cBecause we find an actual conflict between federal and state law, we need not decide whether the HOLA or the Board\u2019s regulations occupy the field of due-on-sale law or the entire field of federal savings and loan regulation.\u201d <em>(De La Cuesta, supra, </em>458 U.S. at p. 159, fn. 14 [73 L.Ed.2d at p. 679].) The court went on to qualify its holding in that case as follows: \u201cAlthough the Board\u2019s power to promulgate regulations exempting federal savings and loans from the requirements of state law may not be boundless, in this case we need not explore the outer limits of the Board\u2019s discretion.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>(Id. </em>at p. 167 [73 L.Ed.2d at p. 684].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1460-7\">Moreover, \u201c[comprehensiveness of federal regulation alone, is not sufficient to establish implied preemption. Again, the United States Supreme Court has said: \u2018We are even more reluctant to infer pre-emption from the comprehensiveness of regulations than from the comprehensiveness of statutes. As a result of their specialized functions, agencies normally deal with problems in far more detail than does Congress. To infer pre-emption whenever an agency deals with a problem comprehensively is virtually tantamount to saying that whenever a federal agency decides to step into a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1711\">*1711</page-number>field, its regulations will be exclusive. Such a rule, of course, would be inconsistent with the federal-state balance embodied in our Supremacy Clause jurisprudence.\u2019 <em>(Hillsborough County </em>v. <em>Automated Medical Labs. </em>(1985) 471 U.S. 707, 717 [85 L.Ed.2d 714, 724, 105 S.Ct. 2371].) Our task is to determine whether the field which has been preempted by federal regulation is broad enough to cover plaintiffs\u2019 state causes of action.\u201d <em>(Siegel, supra, </em>210 Cal.App.3d 953, 961-962.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1461-5\">We conclude it does not. The cause of action for unfair business practices as alleged by the People does not directly affect the operations of Highland, and therefore, is not covered by the subject regulations. Similarly, the regulations promulgated under HOLA do not pertain to racketeering charges under a RICO action. The remaining causes of action, e.g., nuisance, breach of warranty of habitability, intentional infliction of emotional distress, fraud, and interruptions of utilities would, at most, only incidentally and remotely touch upon the operations of Highland in its capacity as a federal savings association. Thus, those also do not impinge on the ambit of HOLA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1461-6\">No implied preemption is found where the impact on the subject is merely indirect. (See, e.g., <em>English </em>v. <em>General Electric Co. </em>(1990) 496 U.S. 72 [110 L.Ed.2d 65, 110 S.Ct. 2270].) In <em>English, </em>the court held the emotional distress claims of a whistle blower were not preempted by the federal government\u2019s exclusive authority to regulate the safety of nuclear power because such claims only indirectly affected the issue of nuclear safety. \u201cInstead, for a state law to fall within the pre-empted zone, it must have some direct and substantial effect on the decisions made by those who build or operate nuclear facilities concerning radiological safety levels.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 85 [110 L.Ed.2d at pp. 78-79].) The court reasoned: \u201cFor example, if an employer were to retaliate against a nuclear whistle-blower by hiring thugs to assault the employee on the job (conduct literally covered by \u00a7 210 [of the Energy Reorganization Act of 1972]), respondent\u2019s position would imply that the state criminal law prohibiting such conduct is within the pre-empted field. We simply cannot believe that Congress intended that result.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 83 [110 L.Ed.2d at p. 77]; see also, <em>id. </em>at pp. 75-76 [110 L.Ed.2d at pp. 71-72].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1461-7\">Also, where the subject matter is an area traditionally regulated by the states, no federal preemption is implied unless there is a clear and manifest intent shown. Thus, there must be \u201ca showing of implicit preemption of the whole field . . . strong enough to overcome the presumption that state and local regulation of health and safety matters can constitutionally coexist with federal regulation.\u201d <em>(Hillsborough County </em>v. <em>Automated Medical Labs., supra, </em>471 U.S. at p. 716 [85 L.Ed.2d at p. 723]; see also, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1712\">*1712</page-number><em>Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith </em>v. <em>Ware </em>(1973) 414 U.S. 117, 139-140 [38 L.Ed.2d 348, 366-367, 94 S.Ct. 383] [no preemption by the Security Exchange Act of 1934 of action for profit sharing rights of terminated employee since California has strong policy of protecting wage earners].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1462-4\">Moreover, \u201cmerely because the federal provisions were sufficiently comprehensive to meet the need identified by Congress [it does] not mean that States and localities [are] barred from identifying additional needs or imposing further requirements in the field.\u201d <em>(Hillsborough County </em>v. <em>Automated Medical Labs, Inc., supra, </em>471 U.S. at p. 717 [85 L.Ed.2d at pp. 723-724].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1462-5\">Accordingly, we determine whether the subject state causes of action are impliedly barred by federal preemption by scrutinizing them to see if they directly are \u201cpurporting to address the subject of the operations\u201d of Highland, a federal savings association. (See 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 545.2.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1462-6\">The state causes of action at issue are grounded in Highland\u2019s wrongful course of conduct which enables slum conditions in the subject buildings to be perpetuated to the detriment of the health, safety and welfare of the People of California and, in particular, the tenant plaintiffs. The essence of those causes of action concerns the right of the state to prohibit, and punish Highland for its part in, the conspiracy to maintain dwellings in an uninhabitable condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1462-7\">From our review of HOLA and its concomitant regulations we have found no statutory provision or regulation which even purports to address the subject of minimum housing standards. Also, any impact or intrusion on the \u201coperations\u201d of Highland is minimal and indirect.</p>\n<p id=\"b1462-8\">Additionally, we conclude neither the intent of Congress in enacting HOLA nor the purpose of HOLA would be served by finding preemption under these circumstances. The paramount purpose of HOLA is to ensure the solvency of federal associations. (See, e.g., \u00a7 1463(a)(l)-(3), and \u00a7 1464(d)(2).) That purpose would not be hindered, directly or indirectly, by the prosecution of the subject state claims. This is not the situation where the state seeks to regulate the conduct of all federal associations in California. Rather, the state merely seeks to protect its own interest in public safety and welfare against the wrongful conduct of an entity, inter alia, which just happens to be a federal association.</p>\n<p id=\"b1462-9\">d. <em>Action Against Karmelich, Pratt, and HFS Not Barred by Federal Preemption Under HOLA</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1462-11\">Since this action is not preempted under HOLA as to Highland, a fortiori no preemption bars the action against Karmelich, its president and chief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1713\">*1713</page-number>executive officer, or Pratt, its loan coordinator and vice-president. Moreover, the action is also not preempted against HFS, which is Highland\u2019s wholly owned subsidiary but not a federal savings association.</p>\n<p id=\"b1463-5\">2. <em>Causes of Action Stated Against Highland Defendants for RICO Violations, and Fraud, but Not Fraudulent Concealment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1463-7\">a. <em>RICO Action Properly Pleaded as to Mail Fraud</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1463-8\">To state a cause of action under RICO (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961 et seq.) a plaintiff must plead facts to show: \u201c(1) conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering activity.\u201d <em>(Sedima, S.P.R.L </em>v. <em>Imrex Co. </em>(1985) 473 U.S. 479, 496 [87 L.Ed.2d 346, 358-359, 105 S.Ct. 3275], fn. omitted.)  In their demurrer, the Highland defendants attack the above \u201centerprise\u201d and \u201cracketeering activity\u201d components.</p>\n<p id=\"b1463-9\">(1) <em>Existence of RICO Enterprise Pleaded</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1463-10\">The Highland defendants argue plaintiffs have failed to plead the existence and identity of an \u201centerprise,\u201d i.e., a group of defendants associated in fact for a common purpose although not a legal entity. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1463-11\">An \u201centerprise\u201d includes \u201cany union or group of individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity.\u201d (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961(4).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1463-12\">The existence of an enterprise is an essential element of a RICO claim. \u201cThe enterprise is an entity, for present purposes a group of persons associated together for a common purpose of engaging in a course of conduct. . . . [It] is proved by evidence of an ongoing organization, formal or informal, and by evidence that the various associates function as a continuing unit.\u201d <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Turkette </em>(1981) 452 U.S. 576, 583 [69 L.Ed.2d 246, 254-255, 101 S.Ct. 2524]; see also, <em>Shaffer </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(5th Cir. 1986) 794 F.2d 1030, 1032.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1463-13\">The facts setting forth the existence and identity of the requisite enterprise are not alleged at a single location. Instead, such facts, because of the complexity of the scheme involved, are necessarily gleaned from various portions of the subject complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1463-14\">At paragraph 150 of the complaint it was alleged: \u201cThe following associations constitute an enterprise within the meaning of RICO generally and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961(4) specifically:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1463-15\">\u201ca. The association in fact of defendants Highland, Northeast, and HFS (the Highland Enterprise).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1464-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1714\">*1714</page-number>it</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1464-4\">\u201cc. The association in fact of defendants Karmelich, Highland, Northeast, HFS, Leyton, Interreal, Interwest, PHC, and Fitzpatrick (the HighlandLeyton-Fitzpatrick Enterprise).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1464-5\">Although subparagraph a of paragraph 150 refers to Highland, Northeast, and HFS, as \u201cthe Highland Enterprises\u201d it is clear such enterprise is but a component of the \u201centerprise\u201d which comprises this element of a RICO action. Similarly, the reference to \u201cthe Highland-Leyton-Fitzpatrick Enterprise\u201d in subparagraph d of paragraph 150 is to the component of the \u201centerprise\u201d consisting of the members of the Highland Enterprise, defendants Leyton, Interreal, Interwest, PHC and Fitzpatrick. From a review of the factual allegations concerning these components of such \u201centerprise\u201d it is clear the requisite facts concerning the existence of an informal ongoing organization consisting of a group of entities associated together for a common purpose of engaging in a course of conduct and functioning as a continuing unit have been alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b1464-6\">The complaint essentially alleges the above defendants engaged in a continuing scheme to defraud the tenant plaintiffs by secretly manipulating the record owner defendants and by actively assisting such owners to perpetuate the buildings in an uninhabitable condition in violation of the law. That the Highland, HFS and Northeast defendants were ongoing business entities which had an ongoing relationship with each other independent of that fraud scheme is shown by the following facts: It was alleged Highland was a federal savings and loan association specializing in loans on residential property; Northeast, an investment corporation located at Highland\u2019s offices, was engaged in the business of handling insurance; and HFS, a wholly owned subsidiary of Highland, serviced loans made by Highland. The complaint further alleged that the association of defendant Highland, Northeast and HFS constituted an association in fact within the meaning of RICO. The above factual allegations thus evidence an interlocking independent business relationship among those three entities.</p>\n<p id=\"b1464-7\">Moreover, it was also alleged that defendants Interreal, Interwest and PHC, all of which were entities in which defendant Leyton had an interest, along with the above Highland entities and the individual defendants, Karmelich, as the secretary of Northeast\u2019s board of directors, Leyton and Fitzpatrick constituted an association of fact, and thus, an enterprise. The specifics of such association are set forth in the complaint and demonstrate an ongoing series of business transactions among these various defendants with regard to each of the subject buildings. (See, e.g., <em>Temple University </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1715\">*1715</page-number><em>Salla Bros., Inc. </em>(E.D.Pa 1986) 656 F.Supp. 97, 102 [sufficient ongoing organization shown]; cf. <em>Calcasieu Marine Nat. Bank </em>v. <em>Grant </em>(5th Cir. 1991) 943 F.2d 1453, 1461-1463 [no ongoing association shown]; <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Brown </em>(W.D.Pa. 1990) 758 F.Supp. 313, 322 [insufficient ongoing unit shown]; <em>Uniroyal Goodrich Tire Co. </em>v. <em>Mutual Trading Corp. </em>(N.D.Ill. 1990) 749 F.Supp. 869, 876-877 [insufficient \u201cassociation-in-fact\u201d shown].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1465-5\">(2) <em>\u201cRacketeering Activity\u201d Based on Mail Fraud Properly Pleaded</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1465-7\">\u201cRacketeering activity\u201d under RICO consists of certain specific acts which are expressly enumerated in title 18 United States Code, section 1961. The activity underlying the subject RICO claim is mail fraud and wire fraud.  \u201cIn pleading a violation of the mail fraud statute (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341) [or the wire fraud statute (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1342)] as a predicate act under a RICO scheme, plaintiffs must allege that (1) defendants devised a scheme or artifice to defraud, (2) defendants used the mails [or wires] in furtherance of the scheme, and (3) defendants did so with the specific intent to deceive or defraud. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(McMartin </em>v. <em>Children\u2019s Institute International </em>(1989) 212 Cal.App.3d 1393, 1407 [261 Cal.Rptr. 437]; accord, <em>Schreiber Distributing </em>v. <em>Serv-Well Furniture Co. </em>(9th Cir. 1986) 806 F.2d 1393, 1399-1400 [mail and wire fraud]; see also, <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gordon </em>(5th Cir. 1986) 780 F.2d 1165, 1171 [wire fraud].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1465-8\">The Highland defendants also challenge the allegations of mailing and wire fraud as inadequate. They argue plaintiffs are required to but have failed to \u201cspecifically plead the time, place or nature of the alleged communications constituting racketeering activity. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(McMartin </em>v. <em>Children\u2019s Institute Int'l, supra, </em>212 Cal.App.3d at p. 1407; see also, <em>Alan Neuman Productions, Inc. </em>v. <em>Albright </em>(9th Cir. 1988) 862 F.2d 1388, 1392; <em>Rosenthal </em>v. <em>Vogt </em>(1991) 229 Cal.App.3d 69, 77 [280 Cal.Rptr. 1].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1465-9\">We agree the allegation of \u201cwire fraud\u201d is totally deficient in the above regard. Subparagraph e of paragraph 151 merely alleges: \u201cInterstate telephone conversations relating to the slum buildings with lenders, persons attempting to locate various of the defendants, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, and others.\u201d No facts are alleged to show the nature of such conversations or the place and time thereof. Accordingly, since plaintiffs have failed to show how such defects would be remedied if leave to amend were granted, we conclude the trial court was correct in impliedly finding the predicate act of \u201cwire fraud\u201d was inadequate to support a RICO action. (See, e.g., <em>Goodman </em>v. <em>Kennedy </em>(1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 349 [134 Cal.Rptr. 375, 556 P.2d 737].) The court is thus directed to strike subparagraph e of paragraph 151. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 436.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1466-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1716\">*1716</page-number>We further conclude, however, the court erred in sustaining the demurrer to that cause of action since the plaintiffs have adequately pleaded facts to support the predicate act of \u201cmail fraud.\u201d The specific factual allegations of the mailings in the subject complaint are both qualitatively and quantitatively superior to the bare conclusionary allegation found to be inadequate in <em>Schreiber Distributing Co. </em>v. <em>Serv-Well Furniture Co., supra, </em>806 F.2d 1393. In <em>Schreiber, </em>the sole allegation was \u201con two or more occasions [defendants used] the United States mail... for the purpose of executing or attempting to execute the aforesaid fraudulent scheme . . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1401; cf. also, <em>Alan Neuman Productions, Inc. </em>v. <em>Albright, supra, </em>862 F.2d 1388, 1393, \u201cThe allegation of [the] complaint concerning predicate acts of fraud are similarly general referring to \u2018many acts of mail fraud,\u2019 \u2018many acts of wire fraud,\u2019 and \u2018many victims.\u2019 \u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b1466-4\">In contrast, the complaint here described the nature of the mailings as consisting \u201cof [the] documents, deeds, deeds of trust and similar matters relating to the slum buildings.\u201d They were further delineated as the mailings were described as \u201c[m]ailing of rent checks, mortgage and loan payments, payment for services rendered, and similar commercial transactions relating to slum buildings.\u201d The mailings of various materials were also described as relating to code violations regarding slum buildings. Moreover, the place of mailing was reflected in the allegation of \u201c[m]ailing of materials to various governmental entities, and recordation of real estate documents requested by mail and directed to the Los Angeles County Recorder. Every recorded document pertaining to the real estate transactions described in this complaint was sent through the mails to the County Recorder in furtherance of their conspiracy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1466-5\">The intent to defraud element was supplied through the allegations concerning their effort to achieve the fraudulent objectives. Additional facts as to the time, place, and content of the fraud are set forth with particularity at paragraphs 87 through 98 of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1466-6\">The allegations of the subject complaint as to time, place, etc., sufficiently comport with the requirement of pleading fraud with particularity. As one court explained: \u201cPlaintiffs cannot be expected to specify the exact time and particular place of each factual omission and misrepresentation. The complaint adequately specifies the transactions and the approximate time frame, the contents of the alleged misrepresentations and the essence of omitted information, and the identities of those involved.\u201d <em>(Onesti </em>v. <em>Thomson McKinnon Securities, Inc. </em>(D.C.Ill. 1985) 619 F.Supp. 1262, 1265.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1466-7\">As to other specific dates and details, we point out such matters are properly addressed during discovery, not on demurrer. Also, when a particular document or matter was mailed is within the peculiar knowledge of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1717\">*1717</page-number>defendants. (See, e.g., <em>Committee on Children\u2019s Television, Inc. </em>v. <em>General Foods Corp. </em>(1983) 35 Cal.3d 197, 214, 217 [197 Cal.Rptr. 783, 673 P.2d 660].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1467-5\">(3) <em>Nexus Between Racketeering Activity and Injury Pleaded</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1467-6\">The Highland defendants next attack plaintiffs\u2019 RICO claim on the ground no facts are alleged to show any direct injury to the tenant plaintiffs as the proximate result of the racketeering activity. <em>(Sedima, S.P.R.L. </em>v. <em>Imrex Co., supra, </em>473 U.S. at p. 496 [87 L.Ed.2d at pp. 358-359]; <em>McMartin </em>v. <em>Children\u2019s Institute, supra, </em>212 Cal.App.3d at p. 1407.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1467-7\">We reject their contention as meritless. The injury suffered by each tenant plaintiff was the deprivation of a habitable dwelling and the loss of the money he or she had paid in rent, which was excessive because the dwellings were uninhabitable. Such injury flowed directly from the racketeering activity committed by defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b1467-8\">(4) <em>Violation of 18 United States Code Section 1962(d) Pleaded</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1467-9\">In a related argument defendants assert the lack of a legally cognizable injury flowing from the racketeering activity also demonstrates the failure of plaintiffs to allege a violation of title 18 of the United States Code, section 1962(d).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> (See <em>Medallion TV Enterprise </em>v. <em>SelecTV of California </em>(C.D.Cal. 1986) 627 F.Supp. 1290, 1297-1301.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1467-10\">We disagree. As discussed, above, the requisite injury was properly alleged, and thus, defendants\u2019 assertion is untenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1467-11\">b. <em>Cause of Action Stated for Fraud</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1467-12\">The Highland defendants contend no cause of action for fraud is stated because there are insufficient facts alleged to \u201c \u2018show how, when, where, to whom, and by what means the [misrepresentations were tendered.\u2019 <em>Stansfield </em>v. <em>Starkey </em>(1990) 220 Cal.App.3d 59, 73, . . . quoting <em>Hills Transp. Co. </em>v. <em>Southwest Forest Indus., Inc. </em>(1968) 266 Cal.App.2d 702, 707 . . . .\u201d They complain \u201cthe People and the tenants [plaintiffs] allege . . . \u2018each record owner\u2019, without any further identification or limitation, made the allegedly fraudulent representations; that they were made to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1718\">*1718</page-number>\u2018plaintiffs\u2019, without any further identification; and that they were made \u2018at the time of each respective record owner\u2019s ownership\u2019, without any further limitation as to time. The complaint is silent as to how the alleged representations were communicated.\u201d They contend the \u201cabove allegations are, of course, calculated to avoid communicating meaningful information about the alleged fraud either to the Highland defendants or to the Court. . . .\u201d <em>{Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1468-4\">Defendant\u2019s contentions are meritless. The complaint sets forth with ample particularity the identities of the record holders, the identities and capacities of the many plaintiffs, and the time frame in which the representations were made. We acknowledge the allegations of fraud lack the specific detailed minutiae desired by the Highland defendants. Those details, however, are properly the subject of discovery, not demurrer. The magnitude of the fraudulent scheme alleged and the number of plaintiffs involved invoke the analogy to the fact situation in <em>Committee on Children\u2019s Television, Inc. </em>v. <em>General Foods Corp., supra, </em>35 Cal.3d 197, 214.</p>\n<p id=\"b1468-5\">In that case, the court rejected a lack of specificity argument based on the following reasoning, which we find instructive here: \u201cPlaintiffs allege that defendants carried out a large scale program of deceptive advertising in which the specific advertisements change constantly, but all follow a pattern of making, in one form or another, certain misleading and deceptive representations. If such is the case, to require plaintiffs to plead the specifics of each advertisement would render a suit challenging the overall program impractical. The complaint would have to include thousands of pages setting out specifics which are largely within defendants\u2019 knowledge. The cost and difficulty of compiling, organizing, and setting down the information would seriously deter the filing of such complaint. The effect of such a pleading requirement, moreover, would not be limited to discouraging private suits; it would also seriously hamper suits by public officials seeking to enjoin schemes of unfair competition and deceptive advertising.\u201d <em>(Committee on Children\u2019s Television, Inc. </em>v. <em>General Foods Corp., supra, </em>35 Cal.3d 197, 214.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1468-6\">c. <em>No Fraudulent Concealment Cause of Action Stated</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1468-7\">Defendants claim no cause of action is stated for fraudulent concealment for two reasons: (1) the Highland defendants were under no legal duty to disclose the concealed facts at issue; and (2) in any event, the cause of action erroneously assumes someone who lends money on the security of real property may, by virtue of that activity, assume the obligations of ownership. They point out unless the defendant is under a duty to disclose, concealment of a fact is not actionable. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1710, subd. (3).) Defendants argue there is no duty to disclose here because section 1962 of the Civil Code does not require the disclosure of the name and address of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1719\">*1719</page-number>owner of certain real property. Such a requirement, according to defendants, is based on the assumption \u201cthat Section 1962 imposes on an owner of real property a duty to disclose his or her name and address <em>even when the name and address of an agent for the owner, such as a property manager, is disclosed. </em>That assumption is fallacious.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1469-5\">They further argue \u201csomeone that lends money on the security of, but does not have possession and control of, real property may [not], by virtue of that activity, become the \u2018beneficial\u2019 or \u2018responsible\u2019 owner of such property and thereby assume the obligations of ownership [and thus, the duty to disclose under Civil Code section 1962] to [the] tenants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1469-6\">We agree no cause of action for fraudulent concealment is stated but not for the reasons given by defendants. The thrust of this cause of action is to compel the beneficial owners to disclose such beneficial ownership to the tenant plaintiffs to enable the latter to seek \u201ccivil relief or governmental enforcement of the law from the responsible non-record owner defendants.\u201d Plaintiffs concede as much in their reply brief: \u201cIf the tenants had known that the one in control of the property was a bank, they would be far more likely to bring an action to have the property repaired than they would were the owner a person having substantially no assets.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1469-7\">A plain reading of section 1962 of the Civil Code<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> reveals its disclosure provisions do not give rise to a duty to disclose the name and address of a beneficial owner. All that is required under section 1962 is the disclosure of \u201cthe name and usual street address at which personal service may be effected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1720\">*1720</page-number>of each person who is: (1) Authorized to manage the premises[; and] (2) An owner of the premises or who is authorized to act for and on behalf of the owner for the purpose of service of process and for the purpose of receiving and receipting for all notices and demands.\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1962.) The reference to \u201c[a]n owner of the premises\u201d is to the record owner, not the beneficial owner. This is clear from the language of subdivision (e) of Civil Code section 1962, which provides: \u201cNothing in this section limits or excludes the liability of any undisclosed owner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1470-4\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b1470-5\">The judgment is reversed with directions to the court: (1) to strike the allegation that Highland charged \u201cpoints and provided for interest, each of which was higher than the rates for bona fide loans transactions\u201d; (2) to strike prayer item (3)(h); (3) to strike subparagraph (e) of paragraph 151 of the second amended complaint; and (4) to conduct further proceedings consistent with the views expressed herein.

Nonetheless, they urge us to uphold that ruling on the additional grounds of federal preemption based on the Federal Fair Housing Act of 1986 (12 U.S.C. \u00a7 3601 et seq.) and The Community Reinvestment Act (12 U.S.C. \u00a7 2903 et seq.). They assert: \u201c \u2018If right upon any theory of the law applicable to the case, [a ruling] must be sustained regardless of the considerations which may have moved the trial court to its conclusion.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(D\u2019Amico </em>v. <em>Board of Medical Examiners </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 1, 19 [112 Cal.Rptr. 786, 520 P.2d 10].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1453-11\">We have no quarrel with their recitation of law except to find it inapposite since defendants have failed to establish the applicability of those acts to the issues before this court. We observe the above two acts were briefly mentioned at footnote 30 of their demurrer memorandum, and thus, were technically before the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1453-12\">On appeal they devote several pages to quotations from the Fair Housing Act in their brief but fail to cogently connect the act\u2019s requirements with the matters at issue, which are mentioned in some detail in only footnote 19. Similarly, the Highland defendants quote at length from the Community Reinvestment Act but set forth no cognizable connection between its provisions and the subject issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b1453-13\">Based on the above we reject their position as unsupported. It is well established that as an appellate court we are not required to consider matters urged in the briefs where no pertinent argument is made in support thereof. (See, e.g., <em>Strutt </em>v. <em>Ontario Sav. &amp; Loan Assn. </em>(1972) 28 Cal.App.3d 866, 873 [105 Cal.Rptr. 395].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1454-7\"> All statutory references are to title 12 of the United States Code unless otherwise specified.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1454-8\"> The board was replaced in 1989 with the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) and its director. (\u00a7\u00a7 1462(1) &amp; (3), 1462a(e).)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1455-7\"> In a footnote of their brief the Highland defendants urge \u201c[t]here is even a direct conflict between certain specific HOLA regulations and the state law upon which the subject state law claims are predicated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1455-8\">Specifically, they refer only to two regulations. The first, 12 C.F.R. section 545.32(d) authorizes an association to make a real estate loan up to 100 percent of the market value of the secured property. They claim a direct conflict exists because plaintiffs seek to proscribe loans where the borrower would have no equity in the property, thus, vesting \u201ccontrol\u201d in Highland. We find no conflict. Defendants have mischaracterized certain language in the complaint. When viewed in context, it is clear plaintiffs were not alleging defendants should be prohibited from making loans up to 100 percent of the market value of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b1455-9\">The complaint alleged, \u201cThe premises involved were security for indebtedness amounting to approximately 100% or more of their value, and additional loans on the property were not available in any bona fide business transaction.\u201d It was further alleged defendants \u201cwith full knowledge of the slum character of these buildings, has made or aided in the making of loans for amounts exceeding the value of the slum buildings at high interest rates and \u2018points\u2019, requiring payments to the lending defendant which absorbed all or virtually all of the rental flow from the buildings. . . . Each . . . defendant reaped financial benefits from the slum buildings\u2019 continuing slum character.\u201d In context, the thrust of these allegations is merely to explain one reason why the slum condition of the property was perpetuated, namely, since no equity was left no additional loans were available to fix up the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b1455-10\">The Highland defendants lastly claim a direct conflict exists between the state claims and 12 C.F.R. section 545.34, which permits an association to incorporate into a mortgage loan contract \u201c \u2018a provision . . . whereby the Federal association <em>may, at its option, </em>declare immediately due and payable\u2019 the secured indebtedness upon an unconsented to transfer of title to the real property.\u201d They argue plaintiffs seek to \u201cdeprive Highland of the <em>option </em>to exercise such provision and, instead, compel it to do so.\u201d (Italics in original.) In support, they point to the allegations in the complaint that defendants improperly made frequent transfers of the property \u201cfrom one uncreditworthy and disreputable borrower to another without exercise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1706\">*1706</page-number>of due-on-sale clauses of loan agreements, without requiring loan assumption by creditworthy individuals, and without scrutiny to determine or insure that payments would be made and that the slum buildings would be maintained in accordance with requirements of the law. By making frequent transfers of ownership of the slum buildings, each such defendant\u2019s conduct facilitated the ability of the involved record owner to avoid criminal liability for violations of the law . . . [and] each such defendant further effectively avoided or delayed repair of the slum buildings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1456-5\">We find no conflict in this regard. By such allegations plaintiffs do not seek to deprive defendants of their option to exercise the due-on-sale clauses. Instead, plaintiffs merely seek to preclude defendants from conducting sham transfers of the property. (But see discussion, <em>post, </em>regarding a direct conflict as to item (3)(h) of the prayer for injunctive relief.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1456-6\"> As further support, they cite: <em>Meyers </em>v. <em>Beverly Hills Fed.

Their reliance on that case is unfounded. In addition to the preemption issue the district court also ruled the claim for breach of fiduciary duty under federal common law was governed by a four-year state statute of limitations. In an unpublished decision the appellate court vacated the lower court decision in part without specifying which part was being vacated. <em>(Eureka Federal Sav. &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Kidwell </em>(9th Cir. 1991) 937 F.2d 612.)

If such greater rate of interest has been paid, the person who paid it may recover, in a civil action commenced in a court of appropriate jurisdiction not later than 2 years after the date of such payment, an amount equal to twice the amount of the interest paid from the savings association taking or receiving such interest.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1460-8\"> Justice O\u2019Connor wrote separately \u201cto emphasize that the authority of the . . .

Nothing in the language of \u00a7 5(a) of HOLA, which empowers the Board to \u2018provide for the organization, incorporation, examination, operation, and regulation\u2019 of federally chartered savings and loans, remotely suggests that Congress intended to permit the Board to displace local laws, such as tax statutes and zoning ordinances, not directly related to savings and loan practices.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 171-172 [73 L.Ed.2d at pp. 686-687].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1460-9\">In his dissent, joined by Justice Stevens, Justice Rehnquist reasoned: \u201cIn \u00a7 545.8-3(f), the Board has gone beyond regulating how, when, and in what manner a federal savings and loan may lend mortgage money. ... In this case, the Board is not regulating the operation of federal savings and loan associations, but the operation of due-on-sale clauses. Without a congressional authorization more explicit than that relied upon by the Court, I conclude that the Board has entered a domain in which it is not authorized to override state laws. . . . Discharge of its mission to ensure the soundness of federal savings and loans does not authorize the . . . Board to intrude into the domain of state property and contract law that Congress has left to the States.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 174-175 [73 L.Ed.2d at pp. 688-689].).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b1467-13\"> Subdivision (d) of section 1962 provides: \u201cIt shall be unlawful for any person to conspire to violate any of the provisions of subsections (a), (b), or (c) of this section.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1467-14\">The relevant subdivision is (c), which provides in pertinent part: \u201cIt shall be unlawful for any person employed by or associated with any enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise\u2019s affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b1469-8\"> Civil Code section 1962 provides;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1469-9\">\u201c(a) Any owner of a dwelling structure specified in Section 1961 or a party signing a rental agreement or lease on behalf of the owner shall disclose therein the name and usual street address at which personal service may be effected of each person who is:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1469-10\">\u201c(1) Authorized to manage the premises.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1469-11\">\u201c(2) An owner of the premises or who is authorized to act for and on behalf of the owner for the purpose of service of process and for the purpose of receiving and receipting for all notices and demands.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1469-12\">\u201c(b) In the case of an oral rental agreement the owner or a person acting on behalf of the owner for the receipt of rent or otherwise, on written demand, shall furnish the tenant with a written statement containing the information required by subdivision (a).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1469-13\">\u201c(c) The information required by this section shall be kept current and this section shall extend to and be enforceable against any successor owner or manager, who shall comply with this section within 15 days of succeeding the previous owner or manager.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1469-14\">\u201c(d) A party who enters into a rental agreement on behalf of the owner who fails to comply with this section is deemed an agent of each person who is an owner:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1469-15\">\u201c(1) For the purpose of service of process and receiving and receipting for notices and demands.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1469-16\">\u201c(2) For the purpose of performing the obligations of the owner under law and under the rental agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1469-17\">\u201c(e) Nothing in this section limits or excludes the liability of any undisclosed owner.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
