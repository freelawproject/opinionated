J.</author>\n<p id=\"AK4\">Petitioner Enriqueta Silva, M.D., seeks a writ of mandate directing respondent superior court to set aside its order denying her petition for writ of administrative mandamus. The real party in interest, the Medicial Board of California (Board), obtained an administrative interim order suspending Silva\u2019s medical license, pursuant to Government Code section 11529.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b508-10\">Although Silva asserts numerous challenges to the administrative action, the primary issue raised by this petition is the correct standard of proof to be applied in a proceeding brought under section 11529. The administrative law judge (ALJ) hearing the cause applied a preponderance of the evidence standard. We shall conclude the appropriate standard is by clear and convincing evidence to a reasonable certainty. We shall therefore issue a writ directing the trial court to stay the suspension order.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b508-12\">Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b508-13\">Silva is a licensed physician in the State of California. In January 1991, Silva signed a \u201cstipulated settlement decision and order,\u201d which settled an accusation filed against her by the Board. Pursuant to that order, Silva agreed that her license would be revoked, but the revocation would be stayed and Silva placed on probation for seven years. One term of Silva\u2019s probation requires that she \u201cshall not permit Salvador Francisco Cano ... to enter the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>premises at any location where [Silva] practices medicine, treats patients, maintains a medical practice, or at any facility where patients are treated or medicine is practiced and at which [Silva] has any interest of any kind.\u201d Cano, who is Silva\u2019s husband, is not licensed to practice medicine in this state. An additional term of Silva\u2019s probation provides that should Silva violate her probation in any respect, the Board, after providing notice and an opportunity to be heard, may revoke probation and carry out the disciplinary order that was stayed.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">In October 1992, the Board filed with its Division of Medical Quality (Division) an amended petition for an interim order suspending Silva\u2019s license, pursuant to section 11529.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The amended petition alleges in substance that Silva permitted her husband, Cano, to practice medicine at clinics <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>where Silva maintains a medical practice or in which she has a financial interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">An ALJ designated by the Division conducted a hearing on the petition for interim suspension order. In his decision, the ALJ found that Silva\u2019s husband, Cano, practiced medicine at one of Silva\u2019s medical clinics on June 25, July 9 and 29, and August 20, 1992, and that, from the whole record, it is inferred Silva knew her husband was seeing patients at her practice and intended to permit him to continue to do so. The ALJ indicated, \u201c[Silva\u2019s] repeated course of conduct in allowing her unlicensed husband to see her patients notwithstanding custom and the law, as well as repeated orders to the contrary by lawfully constituted authority, raise an inference of contumacious misconduct so gross in degree as to justify an order of interim suspension notwithstanding the financial detriment she will suffer in the normal course of such suspension.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">The ALJ concluded the Board established <em>\u201cby a preponderance of the </em>evidence\u201d that Silva engaged in and will continue to engage in acts or omissions constituting violations of the Medical Practice Act by committing unprofessional conduct, as defined by Business and Professions Code section 2234, subdivision (a), in that she failed to comply with the lawful terms of her probation. Moreover, the ALJ indicated, permitting Silva to practice medicine will endanger the public health and safety. Accordingly, the ALJ ordered Silva\u2019s license suspended pending the resolution of an accusation to be filed against her by the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">In accordance with section 11529, subdivision (h) (see fn. 2, <em>ante), </em>Silva then filed in the respondent court a petition for writ of administrative mandamus. Silva subsequently filed a document entitled \u201cex parte application for temporary stay of interim suspension order.\u201d Following the filing of opposition by the Board, the respondent court denied the application for issuance of an alternative writ and the application for a temporary stay order.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">Silva sought review of the respondent court\u2019s order by petition for writ of mandate in this court. We notified the parties we were considering issuing a peremptory writ of mandate in the first instance and that any further opposition to the petition was to be timely filed. We also stayed enforcement of the interim suspension order pending receipt of opposition and further order of this court. The Board has filed opposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">Standard of Proof Under Section 11529</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">Section 11529 is silent as to the standard of proof to be applied by the ALJ at the hearing on the Board\u2019s application for an interim order. (See fn. 2, <em>ante.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">Silva contends the ALJ erroneously applied the preponderance of the evidence standard of proof at her section 11529 hearing. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">In <em>Ettinger </em>v. <em>Board of Medical Quality Assurance </em>(1982) 135 Cal.App.3d 853, 856 [185 Cal.Rptr. 601], the court held the \u201cclear and convincing proof to a reasonable certainty\u201d standard of proof applies at Board administrative proceedings to revoke or suspend a medical license. The <em>Ettinger </em>court explained that the higher \u201cclear and convincing\u201d standard has been applied in disciplinary proceedings against other professional licensees, such as real estate brokers and attorneys. Although attorney discipline proceedings have a \u201cnature all their own, neither civil nor criminal,\u201d nevertheless the purpose of attorney discipline proceedings and doctor license suspension proceedings is identical. \u201cSince it is apparent that the underlying purpose of disciplining both attorneys and physicians is protection of the public, it would be anomalous to require a higher degree of proof in disciplinary hearings involving attorneys or real estate agents than in hearings involving physicians.\u201d <em>{Id. </em>at pp. 855-856.)</p>\n<p id=\"b511-9\">The <em>Ettinger </em>court distinguished cases applying the preponderance of evidence standard to compensation benefits hearings and public employee discipline hearings. \u201cA careful examination of these cases shows a difference between the policy considerations and interests involved there and those connected with the instant case. Neither <em>Perales </em>[v. <em>Department of Human Resources Dev. </em>(1973) 32 Cal.App.3d 332 (108 Cal.Rptr. 167)], <em>Pereyda </em>[v. <em>State Personnel Board </em>(1971) 15 Cal.App.3d 47 (92 Cal.Rptr. 746)], nor <em>Skelly </em>[v. <em>State Personnel Bd. </em>(1975) 15 Cal.3d 194 (124 Cal.Rptr. 14, 539 P.2d 774)] was dealing with the revocation or suspension of professional licenses. Both <em>Skelly </em>and <em>Pereyda </em>involved action taken by the state against its employees. It seems only logical to require a higher standard of proof when dealing with revocation or discipline of a professional licensee as opposed to mere termination of state employment. The former affects one\u2019s right to a specific professional employment, while the latter involves only the right to be employed by a specific employer. It is the totality of professional employment opportunity involving vested interest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>rights which requires the higher standard.\u201d <em>(Ettinger </em>v. <em>Board of Medical Quality Assurance, supra, </em>135 Cal.App.3d at p. 857.)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">There is no logical distinction between the physician\u2019s interests affected by the license suspension or revocation procedure discussed in <em>Ettinger </em>and the section 11529 interim suspension procedure at issue here. In <em>Ettinger, </em>the Board suspended the physician\u2019s license for one year, but stayed the suspension and placed the physician on probation for one year. (135 Cal.App.3d at p. 854.) Here, the ALJ suspended Silva\u2019s physician\u2019s license which obviously has a greater impact on her interests than the probationary order in <em>Ettinger.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\"> We have no occasion to detenriue if the rule stated in <em>Ettinger </em>is of constitutional origin. The Legislature has expressly declined to apply the preponderance of evidence standard in section 11529 interim proceedings.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Legislature added section 11529 as part of the \u201cMedical Judicial Procedure Improvement Act\u201d (Stats. 1990, ch. 1597, \u00a7\u00a7 35, 39) by enacting Senate Bill No. 2375, 1989-1990 Regular Session.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As initially introduced, section 11529 would have established a \u201cpreponderance of competent evidence\u201d standard of proof for interim order proceedings. (Sen. Bill No. 2375, 1st reading Feb. 28, 1990 (1989-1990 Reg. Sess.) \u00a7 30.) However, the Senate amended section 11529 to delete the preponderance of evidence standard. (Sen. Bill No. 2375, as amended Apr. 24, 1990 (1989-1990 Reg. Sess.) \u00a7 38.)</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">\u201cThe rejection by the Legislature of a specific provision contained in an act as originally introduced is most persuasive to the conclusion that the act should not be construed to include the omitted provision. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Rich </em>v. <em>State Board of Optometry </em>(1965) 235 Cal.App.2d 591, 607 [45 Cal.Rptr. 512]; see also <em>California Mfrs. Assn. </em>v. <em>Public Utilities </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number><em>Com. </em>(1979) 24 Cal.3d 836, 846 [157 Cal.Rptr. 676, 598 P.2d 836]; <em>Madrid </em>v. <em>Justice Court </em>(1975) 52 Cal.App.3d 819, 825 [125 Cal.Rptr. 348].)  We must conclude the Legislature did not intend that the preponderance of the evidence standard would apply in interim order proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">Moreover, the Legislature was presumably aware of the decision in <em>Ettinger </em>v. <em>Board of Medical Quality Assurance, supra, </em>135 Cal.App.3d 853 and enacted section 11529 in light thereof. <em>(Stafford </em>v. <em>Realty Bond Service Corp. </em>(1952) 39 Cal.2d 797, 805 [249 P.2d 241].) By expressly rejecting the preponderance of evidence standard, and by failing to prescribe a standard other than clear and convincing evidence, the Legislature presumably intended that the clear and convincing evidence standard should apply to section 11529 interim proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">For these reasons, we conclude the ALJ should have applied a clear and convincing evidence standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b513-8\">Remedies</p>\n<p id=\"b513-9\">We need not address the parties\u2019 arguments regarding whether the evidence warrants suspension of Silva\u2019s license under the clear and convincing evidence standard of proof. Except in circumstances not present here, the role of an appellate court does not include making factual findings. \u201c[W]e are not in position to assume that the [trier] would make the same findings under [section 11529] which it made using the preponderance of evidence test.\u201d <em>(In re Terry D. </em>(1978) 83 Cal.App.3d 890, 899 [148 Cal.Rptr. 221] [reversing judgment sustaining petition to declare children free from parental custody and control where trial court erroneously applied preponderance of evidence rather than clear and convincing evidence test]; see also <em>Lillian F. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1984) 160 Cal.App.3d 314, 317 [206 Cal.Rptr. 603] [issuing writ of mandate to compel trial court to apply clear and convincing rather than preponderance test without discussion whether evidence sufficient under more stringent test].)</p>\n<p id=\"b513-10\">Moreover, we will not direct the respondent court to analyze the evidence under the clear and convincing evidence test. In <em>Ettinger </em>v. <em>Board of Medical Quality Assurance, supra, </em>135 Cal.App.3d 853, the appellate court reversed the superior court\u2019s order denying a petition for writ of mandamus to review the Board\u2019s order suspending the physician\u2019s license. <em>Ettinger </em>recognized that the superior court\u2019s function on writ review of a medical license suspension proceeding is to analyze the evidence under the weight of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>the evidence test set out in Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5, subdivision (c), which is synonymous with the preponderance of the evidence test. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 858.) Hence, rather than directing the superior court to consider the evidence under the clear and convincing evidence test, which the superior court is not authorized to do, the appellate court ordered the issuance of the mandamus writ \u201cdirecting the Board to reinstate the certificate here in issue until such time as it redetermines the cause.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">This analysis was explained in <em>Gardner </em>v. <em>Commission on Professional Competence </em>(1985) 164 Cal.App.3d 1035 [210 Cal.Rptr. 795]. There, the appellate court rejected a fired teacher\u2019s contention that the administrative agency reviewing his termination should have applied the clear and convincing, rather than preponderance of evidence, standard of proof. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1038-1040.) In a footnote, the court explained: \u201cWe agree with Gardner that if the Commission had been required to apply the higher standard of proof, he would be entitled to a new hearing even though the superior court must employ the basic preponderance of the evidence test. . . . The findings of the agency come to the trial court, even in the \u2018independent judgment\u2019 context \u2018\u2019\u2019with a strong presumption of their correctness . . .\u201d \u2019 [citations]. Therefore, an administrative agency is required to apply the proper standard of proof. (See <em>Ettinger </em>v. <em>Board of Medical Quality Assurance, supra, </em>135 Cal.App.3d at p. 856.)\u201d <em>(Gardner </em>v. <em>Commission on Professional Competence, supra, </em>164 Cal.App.3d at p. 1039, fn. 2.)</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">However, unlike the context of an accusation license suspension proceeding, as in <em>Ettinger, </em>here a specific statutory provision limits the remedies available to the reviewing court. Subdivision (h) of section 11529 provides in pertinent part: \u201cThe relief which may be ordered shall be limited to a stay of the interim order.\u201d Thus, we may not direct the respondent court to issue a writ of mandamus directing the Division or its ALJ to reconsider the evidence under the clear and convincing evidence test.  We must, instead, order respondent court to stay the interim order.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>Because we conclude a stay of the interim order must issue, we need not address Silva\u2019s additional arguments regarding whether exigent circumstances are required for a section 11529 interim order, the existence of less onerous sanctions than interim suspension, whether the suspension order was a punitive abuse of discretion, and the extent of discovery authorized in a section 11529 proceeding.  Nor do we believe petitioner is entitled to an award of attorney fees under section 800. The ALJ\u2019s application of the preponderance of evidence standard was an error of law, but \u201cerroneous interpretation of the law does not necessarily mean the [ALJ\u2019s] action was arbitrary or capricious.\u201d <em>(Burdick </em>v. <em>Board of Retirement </em>(1988) 200 Cal.App.3d 1248, 1256 [246 Cal.Rptr. 555].) We find nothing in the record to suggest the ALJ acted arbitrarily or out of caprice.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">Finally, assuming the Board\u2019s contention is correct that Silva\u2019s petition for writ of mandate was improperly verified because on information and belief (but see <em>Fall River Joint Unified School Dist. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 431, 436 [253 Cal.Rptr. 587]), nevertheless, on January 25, 1993, Silva filed a supplemental verification, without objection, which recites under penalty of perjury that the allegations of the petition are true of Silva\u2019s own knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">\u201cMandamus is issued \u2018to compel the performance of an act which the law specially enjoins . . . .\u2019 (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1085.) Although mandamus does not generally lie to control the exercise of judicial discretion, the writ will issue \u2018where, under the facts, that discretion can be exercised in only one way.\u2019 <em>(Babb </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1971) 3 Cal.3d 841, 851 [92 Cal.Rptr. 179, 479 P.2d 379]; <em>Hurtado </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 574, 579 [114 Cal.Rptr. 106, 522 P.2d 666].)\u201d <em>(Robbins </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1985) 38 Cal.3d 199, 205 [211 Cal.Rptr. 398, 695 P.2d 695].)</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">\u201cMandamus is appropriate \u2018where there is not a plain, speedy, and adequate remedy, in the ordinary course of law.\u2019 Code Civ.

However, \u201cwhen the remedy by appeal is rendered inadequate in the context of a specific case, this court may, in its discretion, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>permit an aggrieved party to bypass the appellate process and pursue extraordinary relief.\u201d <em>(California Trial Lawyers Assn. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1986) 187 Cal.App.3d 575, 579 [231 Cal.Rptr. 725].) \u201c \u2018[T]he issues presented are of great public importance and must be resolved promptly[,]\u2019 \u201d and we shall therefore exercise our original mandamus jurisdiction. <em>(California Educational Facilities Authority </em>v. <em>Priest </em>(1974) 12 Cal.3d 593, 598 [116 Cal.Rptr. 361, 526 P.2d 513], quoting <em>County of Sacramento </em>v. <em>Hickman </em>(1967) 66 Cal.2d 841, 845 [59 Cal.Rptr. 609, 428 P.2d 593]; see also <em>Robbins </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>38 Cal.3d at p. 205; <em>Industrial Welfare Com. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1980) 27 Cal.3d 690, 699-700 [166 Cal.Rptr. 331, 613 P.2d 579].)</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">Having complied with the procedural requirements delineated in <em>Palma </em>v. <em>U.S. Industrial Fasteners, Inc. </em>(1984) 36 Cal.3d 171 [203 Cal.Rptr. 626, 681 P.2d 893], we are authorized to issue a peremptory writ of mandate in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">Let a peremptory writ of mandate issue directing the respondent superior court to vacate its order of November 24, 1992, denying petitioner\u2019s application for temporary stay and issuance of an alternative writ, and to enter a new order issuing a stay of the underlying interim order pursuant to section 11529, subdivision (h).

(Cf. <em>Medical Bd. of California </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1991) 227 Cal.App.3d 1458 [278 Cal.Rptr. 247] [issuing writ of mandate to overturn temporary stay of medical license revocation order, following accusation, because no showing that agency unlikely to prevail, as required by subd. (h)].) Moreover, subdivision (g) of Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5 is inapplicable here because the respondent court\u2019s order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>did not merely deny a request for temporary stay but effectively denied Silva\u2019s mandamus petition in toto. Finally, it goes without saying that a trial court\u2019s discretion to deny a request for stay cannot take precedence over its mandatory duty to ensure that administrative agencies conduct proceedings in accordance with law; in this case, that is, under the clear and convincing evidence standard of proof.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
