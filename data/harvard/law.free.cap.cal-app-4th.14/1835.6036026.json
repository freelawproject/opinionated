A is injured in a collision for which B is liable. B is insured under a policy with $15,000/$30,000 liability limits. Because other persons were also injured in the accident, the amount of benefits under B\u2019s policy actually available to A is $7,500, which does not fully compensate A for his damages. Is A entitled to any underinsured motorist benefits from his own insurer? When the underinsured motorist coverage in A\u2019s policy is set forth in language indistinguishable from that in Insurance Code<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> section 11580.2, subdivision (p), as it was here, we answer the question no. In doing so, we join the Third and Fourth Appellate Districts. (See <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Messinger </em>(1991) 232 Cal.App.3d 508 [283 Cal.Rptr. 493]; <em>Schwieterman </em>v. <em>Mercury Casualty Co. </em>(1991) 229 Cal.App.3d 1044 [280 Cal.Rptr. 804].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1535-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1837\">*1837</page-number>Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1535-5\">Appellant Gilbert Lopez filed a declaratory relief action against Allstate Insurance Company alleging that a controversy existed concerning Lopez\u2019s claim for underinsured motorist benefits under Allstate\u2019s policy issued to Joe M. and Barbara Orozco. The underinsured coverage limits in Allstate\u2019s policy are $15,000 per person and $30,000 per occurrence. According to the complaint, on April 2, 1989, Lopez was operating a vehicle owned by the Orozcos and was involved in an accident on State Route 198 in Visalia, Tulare County. Lopez claimed a cause of action against Lonnie D. Thornton and Tina Womack for negligently causing the accident and injuries to Lopez. Thornton and Womack were insured by Farmers Insurance Company under a policy with liability limits of $15,000 per person and $30,000 per occurrence. Farmers paid the $30,000 policy limits to three claimants, including Lopez, whose proportionate share was $7,500. Lopez then presented his claim for underinsured benefits under the Allstate policy. Allstate denied the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1535-6\">After its demurrer to the complaint was overruled, Allstate answered. The answer contained an affirmative defense that the Thomton/Womack vehicle \u201cwas not an \u2018underinsured motor vehicle\u2019 in that it had in effect at the time of the accident a policy of automobile liability insurance in an amount equal to, but not less than, the applicable limits of Plaintiff\u2019s policy.\u201d Allstate then filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings, or in the alternative, for summary judgment. The motion was supported by a statement of undisputed material facts, one of which was that the Allstate policy \u201cdescribes an uninsured auto as \u2018an underinsured motor vehicle which has a bodily injury liability bond or bodily injury liability insurance in effect and applicable at the time of the accident, <em>but in an amount less than </em>the applicable bodily injury limit of liability for Uninsured Motorist Bodily Injury coverage shown in the declarations page.\u2019 (Italics added.)\u201d A copy of the Allstate policy was attached to a supporting declaration. Lopez opposed the motion but did not file a separate statement responding to Allstate\u2019s statement of undisputed facts. (See Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, subd. (b).) Lopez did not appear at the hearing, submitting the matter on written points and authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b1535-7\">The court granted the alternative motion for summary judgment, finding that because the Thornton/Womack vehicle was insured by Farmers Insurance Company for \u201can amount equal to Plaintiff\u2019s policy limits,\u201d it was not \u201cunderinsured\u201d and Lopez was not entitled to any benefits under the under-insured motorist coverage in the Allstate policy. Judgment was entered in Allstate\u2019s favor. Lopez filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1536-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1838\">*1838</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1536-4\">The parties agree that this case presents only a question of law, revolving around section 11580.2, subdivision (p)(2), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1536-5\">\u201c \u2018Underinsured motor vehicle\u2019 means a motor vehicle that is an insured motor vehicle but insured for an amount that is less than the uninsured motorist limits carried on the motor vehicle of the injured person.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1536-6\">The definition is important because underinsured motorist coverage is applicable only when bodily injury is caused by an \u201cunderinsured motor vehicle.\u201d (\u00a7 11580.2, subd. (p).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1536-7\">Lopez argues that the phrase \u201cinsured for an amount that is less than\u201d refers to the amount of coverage actually available to the injured person rather than to the stated policy limits of the tortfeasor\u2019s liability policy. Because the amount of benefits available to Lopez under the Thornton/ Womack policy issued by Farmers was only $7,500, an amount less than the uninsured/underinsured coverage of the Allstate policy, he argues the Thornton/Womack vehicle was an \u201cunderinsured motor vehicle\u201d and the Allstate coverage was triggered.</p>\n<p id=\"b1536-8\">This same argument was presented to and rejected by another panel of this court recently in <em>Royal Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Cole </em>(1993) 13 Cal.App.4th 880 [16 Cal.Rptr.2d 660]. The facts in that case, though, were significantly different from those here. In <em>Royal </em>there was only one policy, issued to Charles and Barbara Franks. The accident was caused solely by the negligence of their son, Cole, who was a passenger in the Franks vehicle, claimed and received benefits under the liability coverage. He also claimed benefits under the underinsured motorist coverage because the liability benefits did not fully pay his damages. The central holding in <em>Royal </em>is that underinsurance coverage is not triggered when there is only one applicable vehicle policy. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 888-889.) In our case, however, two policies are in play, so the issue raised by Lopez is presented in its \u201cpure\u201d form.</p>\n<p id=\"b1536-9\">Two other appellate courts have recently considered the issue and decided it adversely to the claimant. The first was <em>Schwieterman </em>v. <em>Mercury Casualty Co., supra, </em>229 Cal.App.3d 1044. The relevant facts in <em>Schwieterman </em>were identical to those here. A divided court held that the statute is clear, and because the liability limits of the tortfeasor\u2019s policy were equal to, but not less than, the underinsured motorist limits of Schwieterman\u2019s own policy, the tortfeasor\u2019s vehicle was not an \u201cunderinsured motor vehicle\u201d and Schwieterman\u2019s underinsured motorist coverage was not triggered. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1046-1048.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1537-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1839\">*1839</page-number>The issue was then considered by the Third Appellate District in <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Messinger, supra, </em>232 Cal.App.3d 508. The facts there varied from those here and in <em>Schwieterman </em>in only one material respect: the tortfeasor\u2019s liability policy limits were $100,000 per person and $300,000 per occurrence, the same as the underinsured motorist limits in the claimant\u2019s policy. Finding the definition of \u201cunderinsured motor vehicle\u201d in section 11580.2, subdivision (p)(2) clear, the appellate court held that the underinsured motorist coverage in the claimants\u2019 policy was never triggered because the tortfeasor\u2019s liability policy limits were equal to, not less than, the underinsured motorist limits. (232 Cal.App.3d at pp. 514-516.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1537-5\">The <em>Messinger </em>court reviewed authorities from other jurisdictions and analogous California cases. (232 Cal.App.3d at pp. 516-518.) In addition, the court analyzed and discussed the historical development of underinsurance legislation in this and other states, concluding that the California Legislature chose to follow a \u201cnarrow coverage\u201d view.</p>\n<p id=\"b1537-6\">\u201cIn determining the applicability of underinsurance coverage, the focus of section 11580.2 is not on the amount of damages incurred or the amount of damages uncompensated. Rather, section 11580.2 affords underinsurance coverage only if the insured was injured by a driver with insurance limits lower than those the insured had chosen in contracting with his or her insurance company.\u201d (232 Cal.App.3d at pp. 521-522.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1537-7\">Lopez urges us to depart from <em>Schwieterman </em>and <em>Messinger. </em>He relies on the views of the dissenting justice in <em>Schwieterman. </em>(See <em>Schwieterman </em>v. <em>Mercury Casualty Co., supra, </em>229 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1048-1052 (dis. opn. of Crosby, J.).) We are not persuaded to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1537-8\">We agree with the <em>Messinger </em>court and the <em>Schwieterman </em>majority that section 11580.2, subdivision (p)(2) clearly and unambiguously restricts underinsured motorist benefits to cases in which the tortfeasor\u2019s liability limits are less than the underinsurance limits. We cannot rewrite the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1537-9\">If the Legislature had intended to trigger underinsured motorist coverage whenever the amount available to the injured party from the tortfeasor\u2019s liability policy is less than his underinsured limits, it could have said so. In Ohio, for example, the governing statute provides that \u201c[ujnderinsured motorist coverage . . . shall provide protection for an insured against loss for bodily injury . . . , where the limits of coverage <em>available for payment to the insured </em>under all bodily injury liability bonds and insurance policies covering persons liable to the insured are less than the limits for the insured\u2019s uninsured motorist coverage at the time of the accident.\u201d (Ohio Rev. Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1840\">*1840</page-number>Ann. \u00a7 3937.18(A)(2) (Baldwin\u2019s 1993), italics added.) For whatever reason, the California Legislature chose a different approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b1538-4\">The trial court correctly decided that Lopez was not entitled to any underinsured motorist benefits under the Allstate policy on the facts presented to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1538-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b1538-6\">Judgment affirmed. Costs to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1538-7\">Vartabedian, Acting P. J., and Buckley, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1538-8\">Appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied July 1, 1993. Mosk, J., was of the opinion that the petition should be granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1534-10\"> All statutory references are to the Insurance Code unless otherwise indicated.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
