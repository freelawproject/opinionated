J.</author>\n<p id=\"ARn\">Joseph bFrancis Ferrie appeals from a judgment holding his pension was a community property asset left unadjudicated by a prior judgment dissolving his marriage to respondent Edna Merle Moore, valuing the community interest in the pension at $397,836 and awarding respondent one half of that community interest. Appellant contends the court lacked authority to enter this judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1255-8\">Statement of the Case and Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b1255-9\">In April of 1979, the parties separated after some 25 years of marriage. Husband had been working for United Airlines since December of 1965, at which time the couple lived in California; husband had moved to Ohio in October of 1977 and wife joined him in January of 1978. Wife returned to California when the couple separated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1256-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1476\">*1476</page-number>On May 2,1980, husband filed a complaint for divorce in Ohio. Wife filed a petition for dissolution of marriage in California on May 5, 1980. Husband effected service upon wife in accordance with Ohio law on May 29, 1980. Wife served husband in the California action on June 7, 1980, and also served and joined the United Airlines pension plans in the action. On the advice of counsel, husband made no appearance in the California action. On June 23, 1980, after a noticed hearing on wife\u2019s order to show cause at which husband did not appear, the California trial court found California had jurisdiction over the matter and ordered husband to make specified support payments. Default was entered against husband on July 17, 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b1256-4\">On August 22,1980, wife moved to dismiss the Ohio action on grounds of lack of personal jurisdiction, insufficient process, forum non conveniens, and California\u2019s prior jurisdiction over the divorce; alternatively, wife moved the Ohio court to stay all proceedings pending a final decision in the California action. This motion was denied and judgment was subsequently entered for husband on December 12, 1980, wife having taken no further action in the case. Wife appealed the judgment on January 5, 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b1256-5\">On January 15, 1981, wife obtained a bench warrant for husband\u2019s arrest for failure to comply with the June 23, 1980, support order in the California action. On June 22, 1981, the California court entered interlocutory and final judgments of dissolution of marriage and orders dividing the parties\u2019 community property and awarding support. The court found it had jurisdiction to make these orders and, among other things, found the United Airlines pension earned by husband was community property and wife\u2019s interest in it was 24.5 percent of its total value.</p>\n<p id=\"b1256-6\">On July 1, 1981, the Ohio Court of Appeals reversed the December 12, 1980, judgment on technical procedural grounds and remanded for further proceedings, but upheld the service of process on wife and found Ohio had jurisdiction over her. Wife again moved to dismiss the Ohio action, asserting lack of subject matter jurisdiction due to the intervening California judgment. The Ohio referee recommended granting this motion. Husband filed objections to the recommendation and on December 18,1981, after a hearing at which counsel for both parties were present, the court rejected the referee\u2019s recommendation, corrected the prior judgment and ordered its entry nunc pro tunc retroactive to December 12, 1980. This judgment did not mention husband\u2019s pension. Wife appealed and on August 18, 1982, the Ohio Court of Appeals entered its decision affirming the judgment and finding Ohio had paramount jurisdiction over the parties because of the priority of the Ohio litigation over the California action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1257-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1477\">*1477</page-number>Meanwhile, on November 13,1981, husband had filed a motion to dismiss the California action. This motion was denied and husband appealed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On April 24, 1984, Division Three of this court issued its opinion rev\u00e9rsing the trial court on the ground that the Ohio court assumed jurisdiction over the subject matter before the California one and, by virtue of this priority, the Ohio judgment was entitled to full faith and credit in California. Wife\u2019s petition for rehearing was denied on May 24, 1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b1257-4\">On September 20, 1984, husband moved to vacate and set aside all orders and judgments entered in the California action (except an order for sanctions which had been upheld on appeal). Wife opposed this motion on several grounds, including that the pension had not been divided in the Ohio judgment and remained subject to division in the California action, and that without the protection of the California court husband would not pay her spousal support and might dispose of pension assets before the pension could be divided. On October 24, 1984, husband\u2019s motion was granted.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1257-5\">On February 14, 1991, having learned that husband was about to retire, wife filed an order to show cause in the still-pending California dissolution action seeking, among other things, division of husband\u2019s pension as an omitted asset.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The order to show cause was reissued on February 28, and a temporary restraining order issued restraining husband from drawing funds from the pension plans pending the hearing on this matter. The orders were personally served on husband in Massachusetts on March 4. On March 6, husband withdrew $360,277.60 from the direct account plan portion of his pension program and began receiving a monthly benefit of $3,633.24 from the fixed benefit retirement income plan (in which a lump sum retirement benefit is not permitted).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1257-6\">Husband opposed wife\u2019s motion. After a hearing on April 1 the court held it had jurisdiction to divide the pension, which had existed at the time the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1478\">*1478</page-number>Ohio court dissolved the marriage but was not disposed of by the Ohio judgment. The matter was continued to June 26 for a hearing on valuation and division of the pension and husband was ordered not to withdraw funds from the pension pending further hearing or to in any way dispose of pension funds in his possession except for necessities of life. Husband filed a motion for reconsideration on May 29, which was granted at a hearing on June 26. On July 19, the court issued its statement of decision finding it had jurisdiction to divide the pension and ordering division of the community interest, which it determined to be $397,836.</p>\n<p id=\"b1258-4\">Husband filed a timely notice of appeal on July 26, 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b1258-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1258-6\">In <em>Henn </em>v. <em>Henn </em>(1980) 26 Cal.3d 323 [161 Cal.Rptr. 502, 605 P.2d 10], the California Supreme Court held that a former spouse could maintain an action to establish her community property interest in her ex-husband\u2019s military pension which was not adjudicated in the final decree of dissolution. The court explained: \u201cUnder California law, a spouse\u2019s entitlement to a share of the community property arises at the time that the property is acquired. (Civ. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 5107, 5108, 5110.) That interest is not altered except by judicial decree or an agreement between the parties. Hence \u2018under settled principles of California community property law, \u201cproperty which is not mentioned in the pleadings as community property is left unadjudicated by decree of divorce, and is subject to future litigation, the parties being tenants in common meanwhile.\u201d \u2019 \u201d (26 Cal.3d at p. 330, quoting <em>In re Marriage of Brown </em>(1976) 15 Cal.3d 838, 850-851 [126 Cal.Rptr. 633, 544 P.2d 561, 94 A.L.R.3d 164].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1258-7\"><em>Henn </em>also found the former wife could not be collaterally estopped from litigating her community property right in the pension by the fact that she failed to assert this right when her entitlement to other community assets was adjudicated: \u201c[T]he rule prohibiting the raising of any factual or legal contentions which were not actually asserted but which were within the scope of a prior action, \u2018does not mean that issues not litigated and determined are binding in a subsequent proceeding on a new cause of action. Rather, it means that once an issue is litigated and determined, it is binding in a subsequent action notwithstanding that a party may have omitted to raise matters for or against it which if asserted may have produced a different <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1479\">*1479</page-number>outcome.\u2019 Hence, the doctrine of collateral estoppel is not applicable here because [the former husband] failed to demonstrate that [the former wife] is relying on some specific factual or legal contention which would have been relevant to the adjudication of the parties\u2019 rights to the property distributed in the [dissolution] decree if it had been raised.\u201d (26 Cal.3d at p. 331, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1259-4\">Husband contends the California court lacked jurisdiction to determine whether the pension was omitted from the Ohio judgment because wife\u2019s action constituted a collateral attack on the Ohio judgment. Husband is correct that the Ohio judgment is entitled to full faith and credit in California even if it was contrary to California\u2019s law or policy. <em>(Williams </em>v. <em>North Carolina </em>(1942) 317 U.S. 287, 293-294 [87 L.Ed. 279, 283, 63 S.Ct. 207, 143 A.L.R. 1273]; <em>Tyus </em>v. <em>Tyus </em>(1984) 160 Cal.App.3d 789, 793 [206 Cal.Rptr. 817].) This means that the Ohio judgment must be given the same effect in California as it would be given in Ohio. <em>(Williams </em>v. <em>North Carolina, supra, </em>317 U.S. at pp. 293-294 [87 L.Ed. at p. 283]; <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Washington Gas Light Co. </em>(1980) 448 U.S. 261, 270 [65 L.Ed.2d 757, 766, 100 S.Ct. 2647].) Wife\u2019s action, however, does not seek to attack the Ohio judgment or give it anything less than full credit, but rather to dispose of a property interest not adjudicated by the Ohio court. As explained in <em>Henn, </em>wife\u2019s entitlement to a share of a community property asset arose at the time the asset was acquired and could not be altered except by judicial decree or agreement between the parties. (26 Cal.3d at p. 330.)  An action to divide an omitted asset does not seek to modify or reopen the previous final judgment <em>(Huddleson </em>v. <em>Huddleson </em>(1986) 187 Cal.App.3d 1564, 1573 [232 Cal.Rptr. 722]; <em>Casas </em>v. <em>Thompson </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 131, 141-142, fn. 4 [228 Cal.Rptr. 33, 720 P.2d 921]) but to divide a property interest that \u201carose independent of and predate[d] the original decree of dissolution and property settlement.\u201d <em>(Henn </em>v. <em>Henn, supra, </em>26 Cal.3d at p. 330.)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1259-5\">Contrary to husband\u2019s apparent assumption, wife did not lose her community property interest in the pension when the parties moved to Ohio.  Community property does not lose its character by virtue of a move to a common law state. <em>(In re Kessler\u2019s Estate </em>(1964) 177 Ohio St. 136 [29 Ohio.Ops.2d 348, 203 N.E.2d 221, 222-223] [California community property remained community property after decedent and wife moved to Ohio]; Leflar et al., American Conflicts of Law (4th ed. 1986) \u00a7 234, p. 649; Scoles &amp; Hay, Conflict of Laws (1984) \u00a7 14.13, p. 465.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1480\">*1480</page-number>Accordingly, if the Ohio court did not adjudicate the parties\u2019 interests in the pension, wife retained her interest in the community property portion as a tenant in common. Division of this asset by the California courts does not deprive the Ohio judgment of full faith and credit, because that judgment did not purport to deal with the pension. (See <em>Armstrong </em>v. <em>Armstrong </em>(1956) 350 U.S. 568 [100 L.Ed. 705, 76 S.Ct. 629] [no violation of full faith and credit where Ohio awarded alimony after Florida decree dissolved marriage without acting on issue of alimony].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1260-4\">Husband contends the Ohio judgment did not in fact omit the pension, but rather treated it as his separate property and considered it in awarding wife alimony in accordance with Ohio law.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Ohio law requires an equitable division of marital property; at the time of the parties\u2019 divorce, section 3105.18 of the Ohio Revised Code listed among factors that must be taken into account in dividing property and setting sustenance alimony \u201c \u2018[t]he retirement benefits of the parties.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Cherry </em>v. <em>Cherry, supra, </em>421 N.E.2d 1293, 1298, quoting Ohio Revised Code \u00a7 3105.18, subd. (B)(3); <em>Hoyt </em>v. <em>Hoyt </em>(1990) 53 OhioSt.3d <em>177 </em>[559 N.E.2d 1292, 1294-1295]; <em>Lemon </em>v. <em>Lemon </em>(1988) 42 OhioApp.3d 142 [537 N.E.2d 246, 248-249].) Also at that time, when a trial court\u2019s order was silent, Ohio appellate courts presumed the court addressed the factors listed in Ohio Revised Code section 3105.18. <em>(Cherry </em>v. <em>Cherry, supra, </em>421 N.E.2d at p. 1300.)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In support of his argument, husband relies on the declaration of John Hix, an Ohio divorce attorney, who states that husband\u2019s pension plan is considered his separate property under Ohio law and opines that although the pension was not mentioned in the Ohio judgment, it was taken into consideration in setting alimony payments (which Hix viewed as generous by Ohio standards) and not omitted from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1260-5\">We cannot accept husband\u2019s position.  In applying the doctrine of full faith and credit, courts \u201cshould not place upon the judgment a construction which is out of harmony with the decisions of the highest court of the state in which it was rendered.\u201d <em>(In re Kimler </em>(1951) 37 Cal.2d 568, 572 [233 P.2d 902].)  Under Ohio law, as interpreted by the Supreme Court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1481\">*1481</page-number>Ohio, one-half of the California community property portion of the United Airlines pension became wife\u2019s outright upon the dissolution of her marriage to husband. <em>(In re Kessler\u2019s Estate, supra, </em>203 N.E.2d at pp. 223-224.) Contrary to husband\u2019s claim, the failure of the Ohio judgment to award wife one-half of the community portion of the pension, as required under Ohio precedent, demonstrates it is an omitted asset.</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-4\">By allowing wife to maintain an action to divide the unadjudicated community property asset, we give the Ohio judgment no less effect than it would have in Ohio. Neither the parties nor this court have been able to discover Ohio authority addressing the question of remedy when an Ohio judgment fails to dispose of a California community asset. In this situation, we assume Ohio law \u201cis not out of harmony with ours and thus we look to our law for a solution of the problem.\u201d <em>(Gagnon Co., Inc. </em>v. <em>Nevada Desert Inn </em>(1955) 45 Cal.2d 448, 454 [289 P.2d 466]; see also <em>Ferrell </em>v. <em>Southern Nevada Off-Road Enthusiasts, Ltd. </em>(1983) 147 Cal.App.3d 309, 314 [195 Cal.Rptr. 90]; <em>Bierl </em>v. <em>McMahon </em>(1969) 270 Cal.App.2d 97, 101 [75 Cal.Rptr. 473]; Evid. Code, \u00a7 311, subd. (a).) Since Ohio follows the rule that community property remains community property despite a move to Ohio, we must assume it would also accept the corollary principle that unadjudicated community property assets remain jointly owned by the parties as tenants in common after their divorce.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1261-5\">Husband also argues that the earlier California proceedings in this case are res judicata and law of the case on the issue of the United Airlines pension. In these earlier proceedings, wife argued against dismissal of the California dissolution action and against dismissal of the orders entered in that action on several grounds, including that the United Airlines pension had not been divided by the Ohio court. Husband contends the subsequent decision of this court conclusively determined that Ohio courts, and only Ohio courts, have jurisdiction over the United Airlines pension. The earlier <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1482\">*1482</page-number>proceedings in this case, however, did not address the viability of a separate partition action to divide the California community property portion of the United Airlines pension. Indeed, it is entirely possible that the very reason Division Three decided the trial court should have dismissed the California dissolution action notwithstanding the Ohio court\u2019s failure to address the United Airlines pension is that it believed wife could bring a separate action to partition the community portion of the pension. Since it is not possible to ascertain what treatment, if any, the earlier California proceedings gave to the United Airlines pension, those proceedings cannot be urged as a bar in this case. <em>(Henn </em>v. <em>Henn, supra, </em>26 Cal.3d at p. 332.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-4\">Finally, husband urges the trial court incorrectly valued the pension in that it considered the pension as remaining community property until the parties\u2019 separation on April 15, 1979, rather than as losing its community property character when wife left California on January 15, 1978. Based on the parties\u2019 stipulation as to the value of the pension, if the court had not viewed the portion of the pension earned during the 15 months the parties lived in Ohio as community property, the amount of the community property interest would have been $37,394 less than the amount divided by the trial court ($360,442 rather than $397,836).</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-5\">The trial court apparently chose the date of separation as the correct date for valuation of the community property portion of the pension on the basis of Ohio law viewing pensions as marital assets subject to division upon divorce. <em>(Lemon </em>v. <em>Lemon, supra, </em>537 N.E.2d at pp. 248-249; Ohio Rev. Code \u00a7 3105.18.) The term \u201cmarital asset\u201d as used in the Ohio cases, however, simply refers to property earned during the marriage; it is not equivalent to \u201ccommunity property\u201d in which spouses each own an undivided half interest in property accumulated during the marriage from the time the property is acquired. (See <em>Henn </em>v. <em>Henn, supra, </em>26 Cal.3d at p. 330.) Upon divorce, Ohio courts are not required to make an <em>equal </em>division of property but only an <em>equitable </em>division. <em>(Cherry </em>v. <em>Cherry, supra, </em>421 N.E.2d at pp. 1297-1299.) In the present case, wife\u2019s action was to secure an interest in community property she continued to \u201cown\u201d after the Ohio decree. While the move to Ohio could not divest wife of the community property interest she accrued while the parties lived in California, there is no basis for the trial court\u2019s assumption that wife continued to accrue an ownership interest under California law once the parties changed their domicile to a common law state. Accordingly, the trial court erred in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1483\">*1483</page-number>determining the value of the pension as of the date of the parties\u2019 separation.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1263-4\">The judgment is modified to reflect that the community interest in husband\u2019s pension is $360,442 and, as so modified, affirmed.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Wife shall recover her costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1263-5\">Smith, J., and Benson, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1263-6\">Appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied July 29, 1993.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1257-7\"> On March 8, 1982, husband filed another motion to dismiss on grounds of lack of personal jurisdiction and a motion for reconsideration of the order then on appeal. The order denying these motions and granting wife\u2019s request for sanctions was affirmed on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1257-8\"> The court vacated and set aside the various orders enumerated in husband\u2019s motion. This list did not include the order joining the pension plans in the action and the action itself was apparently not dismissed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1257-9\"> Wife\u2019s declaration stated that husband had offered to pay her $150,000 for her interest in the pension but that United Airlines would require a court order to disburse funds to her; that husband had not disclosed the pension to the Ohio court; that she had received no money from husband under the Ohio judgment; that she had received money for spousal support and attorney fees only because the California court entered the requisite orders and enforced them with wage assignments; and that husband had obtained an order in Ohio allowing him to offset against the sum owed wife under the Ohio judgment amounts paid under the California wage assignment which exceeded the support ordered in Ohio.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1257-10\"> Husband elected to receive a \u201clife annuity with remainder\u201d under which no benefits would be paid after his death, as opposed to a \u201c50% contingent annuity\u201d under which a lesser benefit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1478\">*1478</page-number>would be paid to husband during his lifetime after which a monthly benefit would be paid to his surviving named \u201ccontingent annuitant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1258-9\">Husband apparently also stopped payment on the March 1 check for spousal support he had paid pursuant to the Ohio judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1259-6\"> That the judgment which omitted a community property asset was rendered in a state other than California does not in and of itself preclude subsequent division of the asset by a California court. <em>(Berry </em>v. <em>Berry </em>(1989) 216 Cal.App.3d 1155 [265 Cal.Rptr. 338] [Arizona divorce followed by California action to divide omitted military pension].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1260-6\"> Prior to statutory changes effective in 1991, \u201calimony\u201d in Ohio was \u201ccomposed of two separate elements\u2014alimony which constitutes a division of the marital assets and liabilities, and alimony consisting of periodic payments for sustenance and support.\" <em>(Cherry </em>v. <em>Cherry </em>(1981) 66 OhioSt.2d 348 [20 Ohio.Op.3d 318, 421 N.E.2d 1293, 1297].) The new statutes replace the concept of \u201calimony\u201d with separate provisions for division of \u201cmarital property\u201d (Ohio Rev. Code, \u00a7 3105.171) and award of \u201cspousal support\u201d (Ohio Rev. Code, \u00a7 3105.18).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1260-7\"> Subsequent decisions apparently changed this rule by requiring the trial court to \u201cindicate the basis for its award in sufficient detail to enable a reviewing court to determine that the award is fair, equitable and in accordance with the law.\u201d <em>(Kaechele </em>v. <em>Kaechele </em>(1988) 35 OhioSt.3d 93 [518 N.E.2d 1197, 1201]; <em>Schneider </em>v. <em>Schneider </em>(1989) 61 OhioApp.3d 164 [572 N.E.2d 221, 223-224].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1261-6\"> No Ohio authority has been discovered addressing the more general question of how to treat jointly held property left unadjudicated after a divorce judgment. Ohio law does not allow the reopening or modification of a final divorce judgment to dispose of property omitted from the judgment, viewing the divorce judgment as binding on all matters that were or could have been litigated and adjudicated. <em>(Bean </em>v. <em>Bean </em>(1983) 14 OhioApp.3d 358 [471 N.E.2d 785, 790]; see <em>Mettler </em>v. <em>Mettler </em>(1988) 61 OhioApp.3d 14 [572 N.E.2d 127, 128].) Accordingly, it appears that under Ohio law, if a divorce decree becomes final without having disposed of certain property, the parties are simply left with the status quo (see <em>Bean </em>v. <em>Bean, supra, </em>471 N.E.2d at p. 790), meaning an unadjudicated asset remains the property of the party in whose name it is held. This does not mean, however, that husband is correct in assuming the pension became his separate property after the Ohio divorce. If an Ohio divorce decree failed to dispose of an asset to which title was held jointly by the spouses, Ohio presumably would have to allow a subsequent partition action to divide the parties\u2019 interests. Community property is a form of jointly held property that must be so divided.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1263-7\"> Wife sought to divide the pension by filing a motion in the dissolution action that remained pending (with the pension plan joined as a party claimant) after Division Three set aside the trial court\u2019s judgment in 1984. Husband correctly observes that Civil Code section 4353 did not provide authority for her doing so. Civil Code section 4353 alters the rule that division of a community property asset may be achieved only in a separate action <em>(Henn </em>v. <em>Henn, supra, 26 </em>Cal.3d atp. 332; <em>In re Marriage of Graves </em>(1988) 198 Cal.App.3d 1047, 1052 [244 Cal.Rptr. 110]) by affording trial courts continuing jurisdiction to award such assets. The statute, however, authorizes the filing of a motion in the same action that originally failed to divide the asset in question. In the present case, the judgment that allegedly omitted the pension is the one rendered in Ohio; the judgment of the California trial court (which did divide the pension) was set aside on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1263-8\">As a technical matter, wife\u2019s motion probably should not have been filed in the dissolution action at all, since the case should have been dismissed after Division Three of this court issued its opinion on the prior appeal. After Division Three found the Ohio courts had jurisdiction and set aside the California trial court\u2019s judgment, there was nothing left for the California trial court to do with respect to the parties\u2019 dissolution and the action should have been dismissed. That the case was not dismissed, however, was more husband\u2019s fault than wife\u2019s. Under <em>Henn, </em>wife was required to have her interest in a community property asset omitted from a prior judgment of dissolution adjudicated in a \u201cseparate action.\u201d This California action is obviously separate from the one in which the divorce judgment was rendered. If wife would otherwise be entitled to secure her community property interest, to deny her recovery solely because she acted in the wrong \u201cseparate action\u201d would elevate form over substance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1263-9\"> By accepting the parties\u2019 stipulation on value of the pension, we do not intend to imply a holding as to whether the proper date for valuation should have been the date wife left California or the date husband left.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
