The case proceeded to a jury trial, and at the close of Moghalu\u2019s case-in-chief, the district court granted Defendant\u2019s Rule 50 motion for judgment as a matter of law. We now AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-16\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b349-17\">Moghalu, an African-American with dual citizenship in the United States and Nigeria, applied for a position as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Criminal Justice at Northwestern State University (\u201cNSU\u201d) in 2006. He was interviewed by Joe Morris (\u201cMorris\u201d), the head of the department (then a division of the larger School of Social Sciences), and Morris subsequently recommended to the Provost and Vice President of Academic Affairs that Moghalu be hired. Morris\u2019 reeom-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>mendation was accepted, and Moghalu was offered employment at NSU in early August of 2006. Moghalu\u2019s employment contract provided for a 9-month term and was subject to review and renewal on an annual basis. At the time of Moghalu\u2019s hiring, he had attained the doctoral status of \u201cABD,\u201d or \u201call but dissertation,\u201d and he represented to Morris that he anticipated completing his dissertation (and thus obtaining his PhD) by December of 2006. Unfortunately, Moghalu\u2019s projection was inaccurate \u2014 although he reaffirmed his intention to obtain his doctorate in 2007 and 2008 and was repeatedly prompted by Morris to do so, he did not complete his dissertation during his employment at NSU.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">More generally, Moghalu\u2019s time at NSU appears to have been fraught with acrimony. Morris and other NSU professors frequently received complaints from students about Moghalu\u2019s harsh demeanor, quick temper, and overall intractability as a teacher. In Moghalu\u2019s 2006 and 2007 annual evaluations, Morris suggested that Moghalu \u201ccould be more positive\u201d in his interactions with students.' Moghalu, for his part, began to believe that Morris and others in the department were systematically undermining his \u2022 relationships with students and conspiring to sabotage his career. From Moghalu\u2019s perspective, these suspicions manifested themselves in (1) Morris\u2019 orchestration of a phony fender-bender incident in the faculty parking lot, (2) Morris\u2019 intentional exclusion of a significant portion of Moghalu\u2019s academic work from a department newsletter, and (3) Morris\u2019 surreptitious machinations to manip\u00falate Moghalu\u2019s course assignments and convince other faculty members that Moghalu should be fired. The record is clear that Morris did indeed convene a retention committee meeting in March of 2008 to consider whether Moghalu\u2019s contract should be renewed. The committee, which consisted of four members of the Department of Criminal Justice and one faculty member from outside the department, recommended that Moghalu be terminated. The recommendation was ultimately accepted after consideration by the Board of Supervisors for the University of Louisiana System, and the Provost and Vice President of Academic Affairs notified Moghalu in May of 2008 that he would not be retained at the conclusion of his terminal one-year contract (which would expire in May of 2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">In the interim, and having caught wind of the committee\u2019s vote not to renew his contract, Moghalu filed a grievance against Morris with NSU. The grievance focused on many of the incidents previously mentioned (including course manipulation and the fender-bender) and alleged that Mo-ghalu had been the subject of continuing racial discrimination. NSU\u2019s independent grievance committee held a hearing on Moghalu\u2019s claims in August of 2008, and after receiving evidence and hearing testimony for two days, the committee concluded there was no merit to the grievance.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">Moghalu subsequently filed a charge of discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and received a right-to-sue letter in late 2010. He initiated the present action on January 23, 2011, alleging that NSU terminated him because of his race and national origin in violation of Title VII.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The case proceeded to a jury trial,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> during which Moghalu <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>(appearing pro se) called almost exclusively hostile witnesses from NSU in his casein-chief. Defendant took each of Mogha-lu\u2019s witnesses (except for Morris and Lisa Abney, the Dean of the College of Liberal Arts) on direct immediately following Mo-ghalu\u2019s examinations in order to \u201cexpedite\u201d the process, and Defendant indicated at the close of Moghalu\u2019s evidence that it intended to call only Morris and Abney (both of whom Moghalu had already extensively examined) as its own witnesses in its case-in-chief. Before doing so, however. Defendant moved for judgment as a matter of law under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50(a), arguing that (1) there was \u201cno direct evidence\u201d of discrimination, and (2) the evidence adduced by Moghalu was \u201cinsufficient to form the basis of circumstantial evidence of discrimination\u201d because there was no \u201cproof that it had anything to do with either [the fact] that he was black or Nigerian.\u201d The district court granted Defendant\u2019s motion and stated its reasons orally, noting that the question was \u201cwhether we reach[ed] a satisfactory presentation of a prima facie case of discrimination in the first place\u201d and concluding that there was not a sufficient evidentiary basis to \u201cfind that racial discrimination [had] been proved by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d Moghalu now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">\u201cWhere, as here, the district court grants the defendant\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50 after the close of the plaintiffs case in chief, \u2018[w]e review the district court\u2019s ruling <em>de novo, </em>applying the same Rule 50 standard as did the district court.\u2019 \u201d <em>Fairchild v. All American Check Cashing, Inc., </em>811 F.3d 776, No. 15-60190, 2016 WL 360599, at *4 (5th Cir. Jan. 27, 2016) (quoting <em>Brennan\u2019s Inc. v. Dickie Brennan &amp; Co., Inc., </em>376 F.3d 356, 362 (5th Cir.2004)). Under Rule 50, judgment as a matter of law is warranted \u201c[i]f a party has been fully heard on an issue during a jury trial and the court finds that a reasonable jury would not have a legally sufficient evidentiary basis to find for the party on that issue.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(a)(1). A legally sufficient evidentiary basis is lacking if \u201cthe facts and inferences point so strongly and overwhelmingly in the movant\u2019s favor that reasonable jurors could not reach a contrary verdict.\u201d <em>Brennan\u2019s, </em>376 F.3d at 362 (citing <em>Coffel v. Stryker Corp., </em>284 F.3d 625, 630 (5th Cir.2002)). \u201cIn considering a Rule 50 motion, the court must review all of the evidence in the record, drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party,\u201d and \u201cthe court may not make credibility determinations or weigh the evidence, as those are jury- functions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., </em>530 U.S. 133, 150, 120 S.Ct. 2097, 147 L.Ed.2d 105 (2000)).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">Title VII makes it unlawful for a covered employer \u201cto discharge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual\u2019s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(1). Liability on a claim that an employer intentionally discharged an employee because of race or national origin \u2014 i.e., a \u201cdisparate treatment\u201d claim \u2014 \u201cdepends on whether the protected trait actually motivated the employer\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Young v. United Parcel Service, Inc., </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 1338, 1345, 191 L.Ed.2d 279 (2015) (quoting <em>Raytheon Co. v. Hernandez, </em>540 U.S. 44, 52, 124 S.Ct. 513, 157 L.Ed.2d 357 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>(2003)). \u201c[A] plaintiff can prove disparate treatment either (1) by direct evidence that a workplace ... decision relied expressly on a protected characteristic, or (2) by using the burden-shifting framework set forth in <em>McDonnell </em>Douglas.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>The <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>framework in turn requires a plaintiff to establish, at the threshold, a prima facie case of discrimination by showing that \u201c(1) he is a member of a protected class, (2) he was qualified for the position at issue, (3) he was the subject of an adverse employment action, and (4) he was treated less favorably because of his membership in that protected class than were other similarly situated employees who were not members of the protected class, under nearly identical circumstances.\u201d <em>Lee v. Kansas City S. Ry. Co., </em>574 F.3d 253, 259 (5th Cir.2009). If the plaintiff succeeds in establishing a prima facie case of discrimination, \u201cthe burden then shifts to the employer to produce evidence that its actions were justified by a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason.\u201d <em>Raggs v. Miss. Power &amp; Light Co., </em>278 F.3d 463, 468 (5th Cir.2002). This burden of production involves \u201cno credibility assessment,\u201d and once it is met, the plaintiff (who at all times retains the ultimate burden of persuasion) has the \u201copportunity to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the legitimate reasons offered by the defendant [i.e., the employer] were -not its true reasons, but were a pretext for discrimination.\u201d <em>Fairchild, </em>2016 WL 360599, at *6 (quoting <em>Young, </em>135 S.Ct. at 1345). The plaintiff can also alternatively prove that \u201cthe employer\u2019s reason[s], while true,\u201d were not the \u201conly ... reasons for its conduct, [as] another \u2018motivating factor\u2019 [was] the plaintiff\u2019s protected characteristic.\u201d <em>Burrell v. Dr. Pepper/Seven Up Bottling Grp., Inc., </em>482 F.3d 408, 412 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">In the context of a Rule 50 motion, \u201ca plaintiffs prima facie case, combined with sufficient evidence to find that the employer\u2019s asserted justification is false, may permit the trier of fact to conclude that the employer unlawfully discriminated.\u201d <em>Wallace v. Methodist Hosp. Sys., </em>271 F.3d 212, 220 (5th Cir.2001) (quoting <em>Reeves, </em>530 U.S. at 148, 120 S.Ct. 2097). However, \u201c[w]hether judgment as a matter of law is appropriate in any particular case will depend on a number of factors,\u201d including \u201cthe strength of the plaintiffs prim\u00e1 facie case, the probative value of the proof that the employer\u2019s explanation is false, and any other evidence that supports the employer\u2019s case and that properly may be considered on a motion for judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Reeves, </em>530 U.S. at 148-49, 120 S.Ct. 2097). This court recently noted that if an employer has met its burden of producing nondiscriminatory reasons for the action taken, then the plaintiff, in order to survive a Rule 50 motion at the close of his casein-chief, must \u201cshow that a reasonable trier of fact could conclude that [the employer\u2019s] offered reasons were pretextual\u201d by \u201cput[ting] forward evidence rebutting each of the nondiscriminatory reasons the employer articulates.\u201d <em>Fairchild, </em>2016 WL 360599, at *6 (quoting <em>Wallace, </em>271 F.3d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>220). Of course, this burden depends on the threshold assumption that \u201ca reasonable trier of fact could find that [the plaintiff] established, [his] prima facie case.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">There is no dispute in the present case that Moghalu met the first three elements of his prima facie burden. Moghalu argues that he met the fourth element as well because his retention was dependent on a PhD requirement that white professors in the department were not subject to.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> However, Moghalu\u2019s argument misconstrues the nature of the relevant inquiry, which is whether he has shown less favorable treatment than similarly situated employees \u201cunder nearly identical circumstances.\u201d Lee, 574 F.3d at 259. We have explained that to establish this fourth element, a plaintiff \u201cis required to show ... that his \u2018conduct <em>that drew the adverse employment decision </em>[was] nearly identical to that of the proffered comparator who allegedly drew dissimilar employment decisions.\u2019 \u201d <em>Paske v. Fitzgerald, </em>785 F.3d 977, 985 (5th Cir.2015) (emphasis added) (quoting <em>Lee, </em>574 F.3d at 260). In this regard, it is true that Moghalu adduced evidence suggesting that Morris wished to see him terminated because he never obtained his PhD, and other white professors were retained (in some cases even receiving tenure) despite lacking education beyond a master\u2019s degree. However, the record also makes clear that NSU needed to employ a certain number of PhDs in order to maintain its accreditation, and it was <em>Moghalu </em>who represented that he anticipated having a PhD within four months of being hired. Furthermore, Moghalu continually reaffirmed \u2014 in response to inquiries from Morris \u2014 that he would obtain the degree (yet never did). Based on this evidence, Moghalu wholly failed to proffer any comparators who made similar representations at the time of hiring and were retained despite their refusal to follow through on those representations. Additionally, the committee members who voted to recommend Moghalu\u2019s termination independently testified that their votes in favor of non-retention stemmed from Mo-ghalu\u2019s mistreatment of students. With respect to this aspect of the \u201cconduct that drew the adverse employment decision,\u201d Moghalu once again failed to proffer a comparator who was retained despite engaging in comparably serious conduct. Thus, we conclude that the behavior of any ostensible comparators who lacked PhDs was \u201cnot even close to being \u2018nearly identical\u2019\u201d to Moghalu\u2019s.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>See id. </em>(concluding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>that the behavior of a plaintiff police officer, who was terminated for \u201crefusing [a] drug test\u201d and \u201cconduct unbecoming an officer,\u201d was not \u201cnearly identical\u201d to the behavior of a comparator officer who lost his firearm, \u201cfailed to report the theft,\u201d and then carried a \u201cpersonal firearm while on duty\u201d). This being the case, Moghalu failed to adduce evidence from which \u201ca reasonable trier of fact could find that [he] established [his] prima facie case.\u201d <em>Fairchild, </em>2016 WL 360599, at *6.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">We accordingly agree with the district court that, because Moghalu failed to \u201creach a satisfactory presentation of a pri-ma facie case of discrimination,\u201d a reasonable jury would not have a legally sufficient evidentiary basis to find for him on his Title VII disparate treatment claim.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Judgment as a matter of law was thus warranted and proper.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b349-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b350-5\">. Moghalu also alleged retaliation and brought claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981 and \u00a7 1983 against both the Board of Supervisors and Morris. The \u00a7 1981 and \u00a7 1983 claims were dismissed, and Moghalu raises only the Title VII disparate treatment claim on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b350-9\">. It does not appear that Defendant ever filed a motion for summary judgment on Mogha-lu\u2019s Title VII claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b352-4\">. Moghalu does not argue on appeal that there was any direct evidence of discrimination, and our independent review of the record reveals none. While Moghalu did testify that he \"specifically heard\u201d Dr. Pedro (who participated in the committee decision recommending Moghalu\u2019s non-retention) use a racial slur in reference to him, there is no indication that the slur was \u201cproximate in time to the [adverse employment action]\u201d or \u201crelated to the employment decision at issue.\u201d <em>Yul Chu v. Miss. State Univ., </em>592 Fed.Appx. 260, 264 (5th Cir.2014) (quoting <em>Brown v. CSC Logic, Inc., </em>82 F.3d 651, 655 (5th Cir.1996), <em>abrogated on other grounds as recognized in Kelly v. Costco Wholesale Corp., </em>632 Fed.Appx. 779, 782-83 (5th Cir.2015)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b353-6\">. Moghalu also claims that he met an \"alternative framing\u201d of the fourth prima facie element (which we have sometimes used) by showing that he was \u201creplaced by someone from outside his protected group,\u201d <em>See McCoy v. City of Shreveport, </em>492 F.3d 551, 556 (5th Cir.2007). Moghalu contends that \"a careful reading of the testimony\u201d reveals such a replacement, because Morris testified that there had only ever been one other black professor in the department (who resigned before Moghalu came to NSU). Even drawing reasonable inferences in Moghalu\u2019s favor, however, this testimony does nothing to suggest that Moghalu was replaced at all, let alone that he was replaced with someone outside his protected group.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b353-8\">. We note that to the extent the inquiry under the fourth element of the prima facie case involves an employer\u2019s proffered reasons for terminating an employee, there is considerable overlap with the \"nondiscriminatoiy reason\u201d and \"pretext\u201d prongs of the <em>McDonnell . Douglas </em>framework. However, as we stated in a recent case, the plaintiff must first \"establish a prima facie case by pointing to an appropriate comparator\u201d before the \"pretext issue become[s] relevant.\u201d <em>Paske, </em>785 F.3d at 985 n. 8. Thus, despite the fact that the record is replete with legitimate nondiscriminatoiy reasons for Moghalu\u2019s termination, we do not reach the question of whether Moghalu proffered evidence of pretext beyond his failure to present a suitable comparator who was retained.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b354-7\">. Moghalu also asserts that Defendant's Rule 50 motion was deficient, and he cites a Second Circuit case for the proposition that a Rule 50 motion must \"identify the specific element that the defendant contends is insufficiently supported.\u201d <em>Wimmer v. Suffolk Cty. Police Dep\u2019t, </em>176 F.3d 125, 136 (2d Cir.1999). Based on this caselaw, Moghalu contends that Defendant\u2019s oral motion was improper because it \"failed to articulate any of the elements of a prima facie case of discrimination.\u201d This argument, however, confuses the elements of a Title VII disparate treatment claim with the elements of the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>burden-shifting framework for proving discrimination through circumstantial evidence. Indeed, as noted above, Defendant <em>did </em>specifically identify its contention that Moghalu had failed to adduce evidence linking his termination to his race or national origin, and the district court agreed. As such, there is no merit to Moghalu\u2019s argument on this point.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b354-13\">. Our decision today stems solely from our independent review of the record and trial transcript, which fails to support Moghalu\u2019s argument on appeal and does not provide a basis for overturning the district court's ruling on the Rule 50 motion. We note that we were wholly unaided by Defendant's elliptical (bordering on incomprehensible) brief. Indeed, the only point on which Defendant made a cogent argument in support of the district court\u2019s judgment relates to an eviden-tiary ruling that Moghalu does not raise on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
