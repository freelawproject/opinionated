The district court denied his IFP motion and certified that the appeal was not taken in good faith. By moving for IFP status, Roberts is challenging the district court\u2019s certification. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-21\">Roberts contends that the district court abused its discretion in denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion because the decision was based on the court\u2019s erroneous finding that his early release would pose a danger to society. He also contends that the district court abused its discretion by refusing to consider his post-sentencing conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-22\">The district' court correctly recognized that, Roberts was eligible for a sentence reduction and that his original sentence was within his new guidelines range. <em>See Dillon v. United States, </em>560 U.S. 817, 826-27, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010). Although Roberts was eligible for a sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>tence reduction, the district court was under no obligation to grant him one. <em>See United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 673 (5th Cir.2009). Roberts\u2019s arguments in favor of a sentence reduction, including his post-sentencing conduct, were set forth in his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. The district court considered Roberts\u2019s arguments but concluded, as matter of discretion, that a lower sentence was not warranted. In doing so, the district court explained that it had considered the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors including the seriousness of the offense and the danger Roberts posed to society if he were released earlier. Roberts has not shown that the district court based its decision on an error of law or on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence. <em>See United States v. Henderson, </em>636 F.3d 713, 717 (5th Cir.2011). Further, his vague and conclusional allegations of judicial bias are insufficient to demonstrate that the district court abused its discretion in denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>See Liteky v. United States, </em>510 U.S. 540, 555, 114 S.Ct. 1147, 127 L.Ed.2d 474 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">Because Roberts has failed to show that the' district court abused its discretion in denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, the instant appeal does not involve legal points arguable on their merits. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, Roberts\u2019s IFP motion is DENIED, and his appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 &amp; n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2. Roberts\u2019s motion for leave to file a supplemental appellate brief is GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b430-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir, R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
