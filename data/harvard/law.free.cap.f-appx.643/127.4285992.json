As the appeal does not present a substantial question, we will summarily affirm the decision of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">Goode initiated this \u00a7 1983 action in 2013 against Louis Giorla, Commissioner of the Philadelphia Prison System, and various other personnel at Curran-From-hold Correctional facility (\u201cCFCF\u201d), claiming that he was denied adequate medical treatment in connection with a hand injury he suffered while confined as a pre-trial detainee at the facility.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">Goode fractured his right hand around 5:00 P.M. on June 23, 2013, after falling from a table in his cell which he used to access the top bunk. Goode advised a corrections officer of the injury and submitted a sick call request the same day, claiming to be in \u201cserious pain.\u201d Defendant M. Satterfield,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> a nurse at the Philadelphia Prison System, attended to Goode\u2019s injury at approximately 9:00 P.M. on the following day, at which time Goode advised Satterfield that he desired to see a doctor because he believed his hand was broken. Satterfield advised Goode that no doctor was on duty at the time and instead referred Goode to see another nurse or physician\u2019s assistant the following day. Satterfield did not otherwise treat Goode\u2019s hand, and this is the <em>only </em>occasion on which Goode Saw Satterfield in connection with his hand injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-10\">Goode was seen by Physician\u2019s Assistant McKinney about 14 hours after seeing Sat-terfield, and seen by Physician\u2019s Assistant Patel the following day. Ultimately, Goode was diagnosed, and treated, at Temple University Hospital for a fractured second metacarpal bone (bone of the index finger).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-11\">Goode filed his initial complaint on October 2, 2013, and on September 29, 2015, the District Court granted Satterfield\u2019s motion for summary judgment, dismissing all claims against him with prejudice. Goode filed a notice of appeal from this order on October 13, 2015.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-13\">The District Court had jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331, and we have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We exercise plenary review over a district court award of summary judgment and apply the same test the district court should have utilized \u2014 whether the record \u201cshows that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Giles v. Kearney, </em>571 F.3d 318, 322 (3d Cir.2009). In applying this test, we must accept evidence presented by the non-movant as true and draw all justifiable factual inferences in his favor. <em>Id. </em>We may summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s award of summary judgment where \u201cit clearly appears that no substantial question is presented or that subsequent precedent or a change in circumstances war<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>rants such action.\u201d 3d Cir. I.O.P. 10.6 (2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">The District Court correctly ruled against Goode\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim because Goode failed to present evidence from which any reasonable fact-finder could conclude that Satterfield acted with deliberate indifference. A deliberate indifference claim, under either the Fourteenth or Eighth Amendment,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> requires \u201cacts - or omissions sufficiently harmful to evidence deliberate indifference to serious medical needs.\u201d <em>Kost v. Kozakiewicz, </em>1 F.3d 176, 185 (3d Cir.1993). This requires proof beyond simple negligence, and \u201cmedical malpractice does not become a constitutional violation merely because the victim is a prisoner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Estelle v. Gamble, </em>429 U.S. 97, 105, 97 S.Ct. 285, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976)).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">The District Court accurately characterized Satterfield\u2019s conduct as an \u201cinadvertent failure to provide care\u201d or \u201cnegligent diagnosis,\u201d and accurately observed that a denial or delay of medical treatment becomes actionable only when \u201cit results in unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain.\u201d <em>Estelle, </em>429 U.S. at 103, 97 S.Ct. 285.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">Goode\u2019s claim against Satterfield rests solely on Satterfield\u2019s decision to not <em>immediately </em>treat his hand when first seeing him, and to not <em>immediately </em>refer Goode to a doctor\u2019s care<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u2014 which apparently would have been impossible, or at least highly burdensome, because no doctor was on staff at the time. Even if a doctor <em>was </em>available, however, Satterfield\u2019s decision to refer Goode for treatment the following day \u2014 instead of treating him immediately \u2014 reflects an exercise of professional judgment and, as a consequence, cannot constitute deliberate indifference. <em>Montilla v. Prison Health Servs., Inc., </em>457 Fed.Appx. 212, 214 (3d Cir.2012) (Observing \u201cthat courts will disavow any attempt to second-guess the propriety or adequacy of a particular course of treatment!,] which remains a question of sound professional judgment.\u201d) (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-10\">Moreover, an inmate claiming deliberate indifference based on a delay in treatment \u201cmust place verifying medical evidence in the record to establish the detrimental effect of delay in medical treatment to succeed.\u201d <em>Hill v. Dekalb Rg\u2019l Youth Detention Ctr., </em>40 F.3d 1176, 1188 (11th Cir.1994) (overruled on other grounds). So even if Satterfield\u2019s conduct rose to the level of deliberate indifference, Goode\u2019s claim would still fail because he has offered no verified medical evidence of any detrimental effect attributable to the delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-11\">For the reasons stated above, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b149-17\"> This disposition is not an opinion of the full Court and pursuant to I.O.P. 5.7 does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>constitute binding precedent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b150-8\">. At th\u00e9 time of the injury, Goode was awaiting trial on attempted murder and related charges arising from a 2011 incident.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b150-9\">. Nurse M. Satterfield is the only remaining defendant in this action. On September 9, 2014, the District Court granted a motion to dismiss filed by Defendants Louis Giorla, Commissioner of the Philadelphia Prison System, and Michelle Ferrel, Warden of CFCF, On September 29, 2015 the District Court dismissed Physician\u2019s Assistant Defendants McKinney and Patel because Goode failed to properly serve them. We find no error in either decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b151-8\">. The District Court analyzed Goode\u2019s claim under the Eighth Amendment. As a pre-trial detainee, his claim is more properly analyzed under the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>Hubbard v. Taylor, </em>538 F.3d 229, 231 (3d Cir.2008) (\"[W]hen pretrial detainees challenge their conditions of confinement, we must consider whether there has been a violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d). The standard is the same under both .amendments, <em>Valencia v. Wiggins, </em>981 F.2d 1440, 1446 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b151-14\">. When asked in his deposition <em>why </em>he was suing Satterfield, Goode stated: \"The reason why is because I explained to him that it felt like my hand is broke and I would like to see a doctor. He told me that a doctor is not on. And ... even understanding the policy, the doctor is supposed to be on call 24 hours a day.\u201d Plaintiff's Dep., p. 16.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
