On appeal, James argues that the district court erred in applying a four-level sentencing enhancement, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4)(B), for James\u2019s possession of a gun with an obliterated serial number. No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-12\">We review the district court\u2019s conclusions of law <em>de novo </em>and the findings of fact that support a sentencing enhancement for clear error. <em>United States v. Rothenberg, </em>610 F.3d 621, 624 (11th Cir.2010). We review with \u201cdue deference\u201d the district court\u2019s application of the sentencing guidelines to the facts. <em>Id. </em>Under this standard, we will not reverse unless we are \u201cleft with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b859-13\">Under the sentencing guidelines, a defendant receives a four-level enhancement if his offense involved a gun with \u201can altered or obliterated serial number.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4)(B). The guidelines provide expressly that this enhancement \u201capplies regardless of whether the defendant knew or had reason to believe that the firearm ... had an altered or obliterated serial number.\u201d <em>Id., </em>comment. (n.8(B)).</p>\n<p id=\"b859-14\">The district court committed no error in applying a section 2K2.1(b)(4)(B) enhancement. James stipulated that he possessed a commercially-manufactured gun with no identifiable serial number. On these facts, James was eligible for the sentencing enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-15\">James contends, however, that the enhancement is inapplicable because the serial number on the gun had not been \u201caltered or obliterated\u201d intentionally: the serial number was merely \u201cworn down.\u201d Nothing in the plain language of the guideline provision requires the serial number to have been tampered with intentionally. Instead, the guidelines impose strict liability on a defendant for possessing a gun with an \u201cobliterated\u201d serial number, even if the defendant had no knowledge or rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>son to know about the condition of the serial number. <em>See id. </em>The guidelines make no distinction between serial numbers that have been obliterated intentionally from those numbers that have otherwise been obliterated by forces of nature. James cites no legal support for his interpretation of section 2K2.1(b)(4)(B); and we have found no cases in which this Court, the United States Supreme Court, or another circuit court has interpreted the enhancement to require an intentional act.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\">James also contends that the government breached the plea agreement when it sought an enhancement under section 2K2.1(b)(4)(B). James bases his argument on evidence of a series of emails between his former defense counsel and the prosecutor, in which James contends that the prosecutor implied that the government would seek no enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">In determining whether the government breached a plea agreement, we must determine \u201cwhether the government\u2019s actions are inconsistent with what the defendant reasonably understood when he entered his guilty plea.\u201d <em>United States v. Al-Arian, </em>514 F.3d 1184, 1191 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b860-6\">James\u2019s written plea agreement contains an integration clause stating that the plea agreement represents \u201cthe entire agreement and understanding\u201d between James and the government and that \u201cno other agreements, promises, representations, or understandings\u201d exist. The plea agreement is silent about enhancement under section 2K2.1(b)(4)(B). Also, at the change-of-plea hearing, James testified that (1) the plea agreement represented the entire understanding that he had with the government and (2) his guilty plea was not being made in reliance on promises or assurances not contained in the plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-7\">In the light of these facts, James could not have relied reasonably on his mistaken understanding that the government would seek no enhancement. <em>See Al-Arian, </em>514 F.3d at 1191-93 (defendant could not understand reasonably that he would be immune from future testimony when the plea agreement contained no provision about future testimony, the plea agreement contained an integration clause, and defendant testified at the plea hearing that his plea was not made in reliance on promises or inducements made outside of the plea agreement). Nothing in James\u2019s plea agreement prohibited the government from seeking an enhancement under section 2K2.1(b)(4)(B); the government committed no breach.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
