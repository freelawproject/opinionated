This is Casamayor\u2019s direct appeal raising multiple sentencing issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-19\">I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"AsT\">A. Offense Conduct</p>\n<p id=\"b928-20\">In September 2013, as part of an undercover sting operation, federal law enforcement officers approached Anthony Cremades about an opportunity to rob several \u201cgrowhouses\u201d operated by a (fictitious) narcotics organization, Cremades is Defendant Casamayor\u2019s cousin and co-defendant. Defendant Casamayor and Cremades expressed interest and, during several meetings with the undercover officers, indicated that they would need firearms and additional associates to accomplish the armed robbery. Cremades was unwilling to be physically present during the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-21\">Defendant Casamayor thus recruited co-defendant Maria Perez to assist in the robbery. Defendant Casamayor asked Perez to find a third gunman. Perez subsequently recruited co-defendant Guillermo Ferro.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number>On November 8, 2013, Defendant Casa-mayor met Perez and Ferro at a gas station, where they discussed their roles in, and strategy for, the armed robbery. The conspirators then drove to meet another individual and to get directions to the robbery target. Defendant Casamayor, who is a convicted felon, drove in a car that contained a loaded shotgun, a bulletproof vest, gloves, a baseball bat, a black shirt with a security logo, and a security officer\u2019s badge. Perez and Ferro drove in a separate car that contained a loaded pistol, gloves, and two black hats.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-5\">Law enforcement arrested the conspirators while they were in route to the meeting. In post-arrest statements, the conspirators admitted their involvement in the armed robbery scheme. Defendant Casa-mayor admitted helping to coordinate the conspiracy, including recruiting Perez to participate in the robbery and to find another gunman.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-6\">B. Guilty Plea</p>\n<p id=\"b929-7\">Defendant Casamayor pled guilty to five offenses: (1) conspiracy to commit Hobbs Act robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951(a) (Count 1); (2) conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute less than 50 kilograms of marijuana, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 (Count 2); (3) being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1) and 924(e)(3) (Count 3); (4) conspiracy to use and carry a firearm during and in relation to the above crime of violence and drug trafficking crime and to possess a firearm in furtherance of these crimes, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(o) (Count 5); and (5) using and carrying a firearm during and in relation to the above crime of violence and drug trafficking crime and possessing a firearm in further of these crimes, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 924(c)(1)(A) and 2 (Count 6).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b929-10\">C. Presentence Investigation Report</p>\n<p id=\"b929-11\">The Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSI\u201d) grouped Counts 1, 2, 3 and 5 together and initially calculated a base offense level using U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1, the guideline applicable to unlawful possession of firearms and prohibited transactions involving firearms. The PSI assigned a base offense level of 24, under that guideline because Casamayor had at least two prior felony convictions for \u201ca crime of violence or a controlled substance offense.\u201d <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2,l(a)(2). Those convictions were: (1) a 2008 Florida conviction for fleeing/attempting to elude a police officer or marked car at high speed; and (2) 2012 Florida convictions for strong-arm robbery and aggravated battery with great bodily harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-12\">The PSI recommended a two-level increase, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4)(A), because the pistol found in Perez\u2019s car was stolen. In the \u201cRole Assessment\u201d section, the PSI recommended a two-level managerial role increase because Casamayor took over the planning of the robbery from Cremades and provided the details to Perez and Fer-roln calculating the adjusted offense level, however, the PSI omitted this recommended two-level increase and calculated an adjusted offense level of 26 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1. The PSI also recommended a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility pursuant to \u00a7 3El.l(a) and (b), which resulted in a total offense level of 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-13\">Ultimately, the PSI did not use this total offense level of 23 because Casamayor was a career offender, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(a). Casamayor\u2019s career offender <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number>status was based on his two prior Florida convictions, referenced above, which were deemed crimes of violence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b930-4\">The career offender table in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.3(c)(3) preset Casamayor\u2019s guidelines range because he was convicted of violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) in Count 6. The career offender table has three preset ranges depending on whether a defendant is eligible for an acceptance-of-responsibility reduction. Casamayor had a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, and therefore the career offender table set Casamayor\u2019s advisory guidelines range as 262 to 327 months\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(c)(3). The PSI explained that this preset range of 262 to 327 months is \u201cinclusive of the 60 month consecutive term required Count 6,\u201d (the \u00a7 924(c) firearm offense).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b930-5\">The PSI also concluded that Casamayor was an armed career criminal under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4(a) and the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1)(B). Because the career offender provision produced the greatest guidelines range, the PSI used U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(c)(3) to determine the advisory guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-7\">The PSI assigned Casamayor 14 criminal history points and a criminal history category of VI. Casamayor\u2019s prior Florida convictions included, <em>inter alia: </em>(1) numerous convictions for possession of a controlled substance and driving with a suspended license; (2) three battery convictions; (3) a 1999 conviction for possession of cannabis with intent to sell or deliver; (4) a 2001 conviction for aggravated assault with a deadly weapon; (5) a 2004 conviction for robbery by snatching; (6) a 2008 conviction for fleeing/attempting to elude a police officer or marked car at high speed; (7) a 2012 conviction for strong-arm robbery; (8) 2012 convictions for armed robbery with a firearm or deadly weapon and aggravated battery with a deadly weapon; and (9) 2012 convictions for strong-arm robbery and aggravated battery with great bodily harm. Casama-yor did not object to the PSI\u2019s descriptions of any of his prior convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-13\">The PSI also determined the statutory maximum penalties for Casamayor\u2019s five crimes. As to the \u00a7 922(g) firearm offense in Count 3, Casamayor was subject to a statutory maximum sentence of life, pursuant to the ACCA, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). The PSI did not identify which three of Casa-mayor\u2019s many felony convictions supported this ACCA enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-14\">As to the armed robbery conspiracy in Count 1 and the conspiracy to use and carry firearms in Count 5, Casamayor was subject to a statutory maximum sentence of 20 years. <em>\u2018See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 924(o), 1951(a). As to the marijuana distribution conspiracy in Count 2, Casamayor was subject to a statutory maximum sentence of 5 years. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(D). The firearm offense in Count 6 carried a mandatory 5-year consecutive sentence. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b930-15\">Casamayor objected, to the following guidelines calculations in the PSI: (1) a two-level role increase; (2) a two-level increase for the stolen firearm; and (3) the use of his 2008 fleeing-at-high-speed conviction as a crime of violence to determine his base offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2) and his status as a career offender under \u00a7 4Bl.l(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b931-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>In a footnote in a sentencing memorandum, Casamayor acknowledged then-binding precedent indicating that vehicular flight convictions were violent felonies under the ACCA\u2019s residual clause, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). <em>See Sykes v. United States, </em>564 U.S. 1, 131 S.Ct. 2267, 180 L.Ed.2d 60 (2011); <em>United States v. Petite, </em>703 F.3d 1290 (11th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b931-5\">D. Sentencing</p>\n<p id=\"b931-6\">At sentencing, the district court first addressed Casamayor\u2019s objection to his career offender status under the Guidelines, explaining that the resolution of that issue, and whether he was also an armed career criminal under the ACCA, might make it unnecessary to reach Casamayor\u2019s other guidelines objections. The district court stated that it had spent time examining whether Casamayor \u201cqualified as a career offender or as an armed career offender.\u201d The district court was \u201csatisfied that the probation officer got this right, particularly based on the cases that appear in the footnote of [Casamayor\u2019s] sentencing memorandum.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b931-7\">Casamayor acknowledged that current precedent did not support his objection. Wanting to preserve the issue, Casamayor argued that his 2008 Florida fleeing-at-high-speed conviction was not \u201ca violent crime [that] meets the intent of the career offender or violent career offender statute.\u201d The district court noted that Casa-mayor\u2019s conviction was not for simple fleeing, but for \u201can aggravated version\u201d that involved \u201cdriving at a high speed.\u2019\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b931-8\">The district court overruled Casama-yor\u2019s objection, finding that Casamayor did qualify as a career offender and as an armed career criminal. The district court said, \u201c[Y]ou go with whichever produces the higher sentence, which in this case would be the career offender sentence which is how we end up at 262 to 327 months.\u201d In light of this finding, the district court concluded that there was \u201cno need to deal with the organizer/leader or the stolen gun issue[s].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b931-10\">Casamayor requested a downward variance to no more than 240 months, which represented the mandatory minimum sentences of 15 years (180 months) on the \u00a7 922(g) felon in possession of a firearm offense in Count 3 and 5 consecutive years (60 months) on the \u00a7 924(c) using and carrying a firearm offense in Count 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-11\">After listening to the parties\u2019 arguments, the district court denied Casama-yor\u2019s request for a downward variance and determined that a sentence at the low end of the advisory guidelines range was appropriate. The district court' imposed a sentence of (1) 202 months on Counts 1, 3 and 5, to run concurrently; (2) 60 months on Count 2 to run concurrently with Counts 1, 3 and 5; and (3) 60 months on Count 6 to run consecutively to all the other counts. This yielded a total sentence of 262 months (202 months plus the consecutive 60 months).</p>\n<p id=\"b931-12\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"A7Tq\">A. Offense Level Adjustments</p>\n<p id=\"b931-13\">On appeal, Casamayor argues that the district court erred when it failed to consider and sustain his objections to the offense-level increases for possessing a stolen weapon, under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4)(A), and for having a managerial role, under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(c). At sentencing, the district court should rule on the disputed matters unless it determines \u201cthat a ruling is unnecessary either because the matter will not affect sentencing, or because the court will not consider the matter in sentencing.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(i)(3)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b931-14\">Here, in compliance with Rule 32(i)(3)(B), the district court determined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>that a ruling on these two offense-level increases was unnecessary because they would not affect Casamayor\u2019s sentence. As the district court explained, Casama-yor\u2019s advisory guidelines range was not driven by the adjusted offense level calculated pursuant to Chapters 2 and 3 of the Sentencing Guidelines, but by the preset guidelines range set out in \u00a7 4Bl.l(c)\u2019s career offender table. Accordingly, we conclude that the district court, at the time, did not err in not ruling on the two offense-level objections regarding the sto-l\u00e9n firearm or his role in the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-4\">B. Fifth and Sixth Amendment Sentencing Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b932-5\">For the first time on appeal, Casamayor contends that the district court violated his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights by imposing a sentence on the \u00a7 922(g). felon in possession of a firearm offense in Count 3 that was above the ten-year maximum authorized by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(a)(2).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Casa-mayor argues that he is not subject to the ACCA\u2019s enhanced penalties in \u00a7 924(e) because the government did not charge three qualifying violent felonies or serious drug offenses in his indictment or prove them to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-6\">Casamayor\u2019s argument is foreclosed by binding precedent. The Supreme Court has long held that a prior conviction may be used to enhance a defendant\u2019s sentence even though it is not charged in the indictment or proven beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 239-47, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 1228-33, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998); <em>see also Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 489-90, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 2362, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000) (expressly declining to overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b932-10\">Casamayor contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>has been abrogated by <em>Alleyne v. United States, </em>570 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2151, 186 L.Ed.2d 314 (2013), but this Court has already rejected that argument. <em>See United States v. Harris, </em>741 F.3d 1245, 1249-50 (11th Cir.2014) (explaining that the <em>Alleyne </em>Court declined to revisit <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and that \u201cwe are not free to do what the Supreme Court declined to do in <em>Alleyne\u201d): </em>Accordingly, Ca-samayor has not shown error, much less plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-13\">C. ACCA Enhancement on Count 3</p>\n<p id=\"b932-14\">The ACCA enhancement in \u00a7 924(e) was applied to only Count 3, Ca-samayor\u2019s \u00a7 922(g) offense for being a felon in possession of a firearm. Under the ACCA, a person convicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm under \u00a7 922(g) who has three prior convictions for a \u201cviolent felony\u201d or a \u201cserious drug offense\u201d is subject to a 15-year mandatory minimum sentence and a maximum life sentence. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Casamayor argues that his Florida fleeing-at-high-speed conviction is no longer a qualifying predicate offense under the ACCA\u2019s residual clause, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(l)(B)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b933-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"911\">*911</page-number>While Casamayor\u2019s appeal was pending, the Supreme Court decided <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>576 U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 2551, 192 L.Ed.2d 569 (2015), which held that the residual clause in the ACCA was unconstitutionally vague. 135 S.Ct. at 2563. Thus, Casamayor\u2019s fleeing-at-high-speed conviction would not qualify as a predicate offense under the ACCA\u2019s residual clause.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b933-7\">Nonetheless, the government contends that Casamayor has at least three other prior convictions that qualify under the ACCA\u2019s elements clause, such as his Florida convictions for strong-arm robbery and armed robbery with a firearm or deadly weapon in 2012, and for aggravated assault with a deadly weapon in 2001. The Supreme Court in <em>Johnson </em>did not call into question the remainder of the ACCA\u2019s definition of a \u201cviolent felony,\u201d namely the elements clause and the enumerated crimes clause. <em>See Johnson, </em>576 U.S. at -, 135 S.Ct. at 2563.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-8\">The problem in this case, however, is that the district court at sentencing did not identify which of Casamayor\u2019s prior felony convictions it relied upon to support the ACCA enhancement. Accordingly, we remand for the district court to determine in the first instance whether the ACCA-en-hanced sentence of 202 months on Count 3 may be supported by any of Casamayor\u2019s other prior felony convictions and if so under what clause.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Without the ACCA enhancement raising the statutory maximum to life, Casamayor\u2019s punishment on Count 3 cannot exceed the ten-year statutory maximum under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b933-11\">D. Career Offender Guideline</p>\n<p id=\"b933-12\">Casamayor also argues that, after <em>Johnson, </em>his fleeing-at-high-speed conviction no longer qualifies as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d for purposes of the career offender provision in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2). The Supreme Court in <em>Johnson </em>did not address the career offender provisions of the Sentencing Guidelines. This Court held in <em>United States v. Matchett, </em>802 F.3d 1185 (11th Cir.2015), that the residual clause in \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2)\u2019s definition of \u201ccrime of violence\u201d is not unconstitutionally vague in light of <em>Johnson </em>because the vagueness doctrine is inapplicable to the advisory Sentencing Guidelines. <em>Matchett, </em>802 F.3d at 1189, 1193-96.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-13\">Thus, to the extent Casamayor contends the district court erred in classifying him as a \u201ccareer offender\u201d . because \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2)\u2019s residual clause is unconstitutionally vague, his argument is foreclosed by <em>Matehett. </em>Furthermore, this Court has concluded that the particular aggravated fleeing offense of which Casamayor was convicted \u2014 fleeing and eluding a police officer by driving at high speed, in violation of Florida Statutes \u00a7 316.1935(3) \u2014 constitutes a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2)\u2019s residual clause. <em>See United States v. Harris, </em>586 F.3d 1283, 1287-89 (11th Cir.2009). Because Casamayor\u2019s Florida aggravated fleeing conviction is a qualifying offense under \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2), the district court did not err in determining that Casamayor was a career offender un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"912\">*912</page-number>der \u00a7 4Bl.l(a) and assigning him the preset advisory guidelines range of 262 to 327 months under the career offender table in \u00a7 4Bl.l(c).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Thus, Casamayor has not shown a reversible error in the district court\u2019s sentencing him as follows on these counts: 202-month sentences on Counts 1 and 5 to run concurrently, a 60-month sentence on Count 2 to run concurrently with Counts 1 and 5, and a 60-month sentence on Count 6 to run consecutively to Gounts 1, 2 and 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-4\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b934-5\">Accordingly, we vacate Casamayor\u2019s sentence on Count 3 and remand for re-sentencing on that count. Nothing herein should be read as expressing any opinion as to the appropriate final sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-6\">AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b929-8\">.
