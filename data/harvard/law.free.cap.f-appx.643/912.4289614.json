In his first appeal, we vacated Defendant\u2019s 48-month sentence and remanded for resentencing because the district court erred by applying a 16-level enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Estrada, 777 </em>F.3d 1318, 1322-23 (11th Cir.2015). On remand, the district court imposed a 41-month sentence. Defendant now appeals that sentence and argues for the first time that the district court procedurally erred and violated his due process rights by relying on a clearly erroneous fact \u2014 that he had been deported several times and returned to the United States. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-14\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b935-15\">In 2004, Defendant, a citizen of Mexico, was convicted in Florida state court of throwing a deadly missile, in violation of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 790.19. Defendant was removed to Mexico, and later illegally reentered the United States. Defendant\u2019s illegal re-entry was discovered when he was arrested in Florida on state drug charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-16\">After Defendant pleaded guilty to the present illegal re-entry offense, the district court imposed a 48-month sentence. On appeal, we concluded that the district court erred by applying a 16-level enhancement pursuant to \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) because Defendant\u2019s prior conviction for throwing a deadly missile was not a crime of violence. <em>Estrada, 777 </em>F.3d at 1322. However, we determined that Defendant\u2019s prior convic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"914\">*914</page-number>tion would support an eight-level enhancement under \u00a7 2D1.2(b)(l)(C) because it met the definition of an aggravated felony. <em>Id, </em>at 1322-23. Consequently, we vacated Defendant\u2019s sentence and remanded for the limited purpose of having the district court resentence Defendant based on the guideline range applicable with the eight-level enhancement. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b936-4\">In anticipation of resentencing, the probation officer completed a revised Presen-tence Investigation Report (\u201cPSR\u201d). With the inclusion of the 8-level enhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C), Defendant\u2019s total offense level was 13. The PSR assigned Defendant a criminal history category of VI based on 17 criminal history points. Of note, in 2010 and 2011, Defendant was convicted of various cocaine trafficking offenses in Florida state court and received a total sentence of 15 years\u2019 imprisonment. Based on a total offense level of 13 and a criminal history category of VI, Defendant\u2019s guideline range- was 33 to 41 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-5\">At the resentencing hearing, after ensuring that there were no objections to the PSR, the district court calculated a guideline range of 33 to 41 months\u2019 imprisonment. Before imposing sentence, the district court stated that it had considered the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors and noted that Defendant\u2019s new guideline range was significantly lower than his original guideline range. The district court then stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b936-6\">That\u2019s the good news for you. The bad news, I guess, is that I thought, when the guidelines were much higher, I considered them, but didn\u2019t follow them, and imposed a sentence significantly below the guidelines at that time. Not much has changed, really. Your criminal history is what it is, and what it\u2019s always been, and you\u2019ve been deported several times, you\u2019ve come back, and you continue to make' criminal activities. The 15-year sentence you\u2019re serving is based upon some of those state criminal activities.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b936-9\">With regard to your good behavior at sentencing \u2014 or in custody, rather, you seem to recognize ... that you are doing apparently much better now, in custody, than you did when you were not in custody. The Court considers, at some level, the progress you\u2019ve made. I recognize you will receive a benefit, because of that, in terms of good time, things like that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b936-10\">The district court rejected Defendant\u2019s request for a downward variance, concluding that it was not appropriate under. the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Consequently, the district court sentenced Defendant to 41 months\u2019 imprisonment to run consecutive to his 15-year Florida state sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-11\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b936-12\">Using a two-step process, we review the reasonableness of a district court\u2019s sentence for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Cubero, </em>754 F.3d 888, 892 (11th Cir.2014). We first look to whether the district court committed any significant procedural error, such as miscalculating the advisory guideline range, treating the Sentencing Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> selecting a sentence based on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"915\">*915</page-number>clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence. <em>Id. </em>Then we examine whether the sentence is substantively reasonable in light of the totality of the circumstances. <em>Id. </em>The party challenging the sentence bears the burden of showing that it is unreasonable. <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1189 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b937-4\">We review factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>340 F.3d 1231, 1234-35 (11th Cir.2003). However, when a defendant raises a sentencing argument on appeal that was not raised before the district court, including \u00e1 challenge to the procedural reasonableness of his sentence, we review for plain error. <em>See United States v. Vandergrift, </em>754 F.3d 1303, 1307 (11th Cir.2014). Under plain error review we will reverse where there is \u201c(1) an error (2) that is plain and (3) that has affected the defendant\u2019s substantial rights, and ... (4) the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Madden, </em>733 F.3d 1314, 1322 (11th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b937-5\">On appeal, Defendant only challenges the procedural reasonableness of his sentence. In particular, he argues that the district court violated his due process rights by relying on a clearly erroneous fact,'namely that Defendant had been deported multiple times and reentered the United States. As Defendant properly concedes, he did not raise this argument before the district court. Accordingly, our review of his argument is limited to plain error. <em>See Vandergrift, </em>754 F.3d at 1307.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-6\">We conclude that Defendant has not met his. burden of showing that the district court plainly erred in imposing his 41-month sentence by relying on the fact that he had been deported multiple times and returned to the United States. With that said, the record indicates that the district court mistakenly stated that Defendant had been deported several times. Indeed, the Government agrees that the district court\u2019s statement was incorrect. Further, the Government does not contest that Defendant was only deported one time on March 31, 2005. However, Defendant\u2019s revised PSR used two different dates to refer to Defendant\u2019s deportation: March 31, 2005 and May 31, 2005. While the PSR\u2019s statement regarding the May 31, 2005 deportation date appears to be erroneous, Defendant did not object, and thus he arguably admitted this, fact for sentencing purposes. <em>See United States v. Wade, </em>458 F.3d 1273, 1277 (11th Cir.2006) (stating that the failure to object to factual statements in the PSR .admits them for sentencing purposes). Because the two deportations dates listed in the PSR could have led the district court to conclude that Defendant had been deported ,more than once, we cannot say that the district court committed error, or that the error was plain. <em>See id.; cf. United States v. Philidor, </em>717 F.3d 883, 885 (11th Cir.2013) (indicating that a factual finding is clearly erroneous when, after reviewing the evidence, we are \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d (quotation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b937-8\">In any event, even if we concluded that the district court committed error and that the error was plain, Defendant has not shown that this error affected his substantial rights. The district court\u2019s imposition of Defendant\u2019s sentence was not based solely on its mistaken belief that he had been deported multiple times. In fashioning Defendant\u2019s sentence, the district court considered the other \u00a7 3553(a) factors, as well as Defendant\u2019s mitigating evidence related to his rehabilitative efforts in prison. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"916\">*916</page-number>The district court also referenced Defendant\u2019s lengthy criminal history and the lack of deterrent effect Defendant\u2019s prior punishment had on his continued criminal activities. In particular, the district court explicitly stated that Defendant committed the Florida state drug offenses for which he received a 15-year sentence after he had been deported and returned to the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-4\">Because the record does not show that Defendant\u2019s sentence was entirely based on the statement that he had been deported several times, he has failed to show a reasonable probability that his within-guidelines sentence would have been different but for the district court\u2019s statement regarding the number of deportations. <em>See United States v. </em>Bane, 720 F.3d 818, 830 (11th Cir.2013) (\u201c \u2018A substantial right is affected if the appealing party can show that there is a reasonable probability that there would have been a different result had there been no error.\u2019 \u201d). Thus, Defendant has not met the third prong of the plain error test because he has not demonstrated that the error affected his substantial rights. <em>See Jones v. United States, </em>527 U.S. 373, 394-95, 119 S.Ct. 2090, 144 L.Ed.2d 370 (1999) (\u201cWhere the effect of the [alleged error] is so uncertain, a defendant cannot meet his burden of showing that the error actually affected his substantial rights.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b938-5\">We are similarly not persuaded that the district court\u2019s purported error violated Defendant\u2019s due process rights. Again, Defendant did not raise this argument before the district court, so we review for plain error. <em>See Vandergrift, </em>754 F.3d at 1307; <em>see also United States v. Candelario, </em>240 F.3d 1300, 1305-06 (11th Cir.2001) (stating that a constitutional objection that is not raised before the district court is reviewed for plain error on appeal). A defendant has a due process right not to be sentenced based on false or unreliable information. <em>United States v. Ghertler, </em>605 F.3d 1256, 1269 (11th Cir.2010). To establish a due process violation, a defendant must show that: (1) the information is false and unreliable; and (2) that the information actually served as a basis for the defendant\u2019s sentence. <em>See United States v. Reme, </em>738 F.2d 1156, 1167-68 (11th Cir.1984) (concluding that a due process violation occurred where unreliable hearsay evidence was the \u201csalient\u201d factor in determining Defendant\u2019s sentence). As we have shown, even if Defendant could establish error that was plain, his due process argument fails because he cannot establish that the error affected his substantial rights. <em>See Bane, </em>720 F.3d at 830; <em>Jones, </em>527 U.S. at 394-95, 119 S.Ct. 2090.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-7\">For all of these reasons, Defendant\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b935-11\">. Section 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines provides for a 16-level enhancement if the defendant was deported subsequent to a felony conviction for a crime of violence and the conviction receives criminal history points.
