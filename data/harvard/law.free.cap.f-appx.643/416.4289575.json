He contends that the district court abused its discretion in denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion because the jury acquitted him on the drug conspiracy count and the evidence at trial did not support the district court\u2019s finding that he was involved in the trafficking of multiple kilograms of cocaine for approximately four years prior to his arrest. Garza also argues that the district court failed to consider the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, and that his 235-month sentence was substantively unreasonable in light of the totality of the circumstances in his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-23\">The district court correctly recognized that Garza was eligible for a sentence reduction and that his original sentence was within his new guidelines range. <em>See Dillon v. United States, </em>560 U.S. 817, 826-27, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010). Although Garza was eligible for a sentence reduction, the district court was under no obligation to grant him one. <em>See United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number><em>States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 673 (5th Cir.2009). Garza\u2019s arguments in favor of a sentence reduction, including his lack of criminal history and his post-sentencing conduct, were set forth in his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. The district court implicitly considered Garza\u2019s arguments and the relevant factors but concluded, as matter of discretion, that a lower sentence was not warranted. In doing so, the district court noted that Garza and at least 12 others were involved in the trafficking- of multiple kilograms of cocaine for approximately four years prior to his arrest. Although Garza was acquitted on the drug conspiracy count, \u201ca jury\u2019s verdict of acquittal does not prevent the sentencing court from considering conduct underlying the acquitted charge, so long as that conduct has been proved by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Watts, </em>519 U.S. 148, 157, 117 S.Ct. 633, 136 L.Ed.2d 554 (1997). Garza\u2019s drug trafficking activities during the relevant time period were set forth in the presentence report. Garza has not shown that the district court based its decision on an error of law or on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence, and, thus, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>See United States v. Henderson, </em>636 F.3d 713, 717 (5th Cir.2011); <em>United States v. Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d 1007, 1010 (5th Cir.1995). Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b438-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
