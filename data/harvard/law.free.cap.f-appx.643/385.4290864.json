By moving to proceed IFP, DeLeon is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal was not taken in good faith because it is frivolous. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-22\">When considering whether a litigant has shown good faith for IFP purposes, our inquiry \u201cis limited to whether, the appeal involves legal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). If we uphold the district court\u2019s certification that the appeal is not taken in good faith, the appellant must pay the filing fee or the appeal will be dismissed for want of prosecution. <em>Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202. Alternatively, \u201cwhere the merits are so intertwined with the certification decision as to constitute the same issue,\u201d we may deny the IFP motion and dismiss the appeal sua sponte if it is frivolous. <em>Id. </em>at 202 &amp; n. 24; <em>see </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-23\">A district court that is considering a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion must first determine whether a prisoner is eligible for a reduction. <em>Dillon v. United States, </em>560 U.S. 817, 826-27, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010). If this question is answered affirmatively, then the district court must \u201cconsider any applicable [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553(a) factors and determine whether, in its discretion,\u201d any reduction is warranted under the particular facts of the case. <em>Id. </em>at 827, 130 S.Ct. 2683. We review the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>district court\u2019s ruling on a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Henderson, </em>636 F.3d 713, 717 (5th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-3\">Because DeLeon\u2019s base offense level was not changed by Amendment 782, his sentencing range was not lowered by the Commission, and he was not eligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See </em>\u00a7 3582(c)(2). The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying the motion. <em>See id.; Henderson, </em>636 F.3d at 717.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">DeLeon has failed to show that he will raise a nonfrivolous issue on appeal. <em>See Howard, 707 </em>F.2d at 220. Accordingly, his IFP motion is DENIED, and his appeal is DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b407-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
