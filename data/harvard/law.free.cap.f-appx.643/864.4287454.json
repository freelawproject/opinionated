After careful review, we deny Chang\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-18\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-19\">Chang entered the United States in March 2001, was detained upon arrival, and was served with a notice to appear. The notice charged Chang as removable under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(7)(A)(i)(I), as an immigrant not in possession of a valid entry document. The notice specified that the time and date of Chang\u2019s removal proceedings before an immigration judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) were to be determined, stated that future notices would be mailed to the address he provided to immigration officials, and warned that the IJ could order him removed if he failed to appear at his hearing. Chang completed an \u201cAlien Address\u201d form, listing his address as 2141 S. China Place, Chicago, Illinois, 60616. Chang was released from custody pending removal proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-20\">On May 2, 2001, the immigration court mailed a Notice of Hearing in Removal Proceedings to the address Chang provided immigration officials indicating that his hearing was scheduled on August 9, 2001. Chang failed to appear at the hearing, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>the IJ, conducting the proceedings <em>in ab-sentia </em>pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(b)(5)(A), found Chang to be removable as charged and ordered him removed to China.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-4\">On July 2, 2002, Chang filed a counseled motion to reopen his removal proceedings, arguing that he never received notice of the date of his hearing. In an affidavit filed in support of his motion, Chang stated that, when he first was released from custody in March 2001, he moved in with his brother at the address he provided to-immigration officials. But, he explained, he moved to New York in' October 2001 and accordingly never received the notice mailed to his brother\u2019s address. If he had received the notice, he stated, he would have appeared and pursued a claim for asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">The IJ denied Chang\u2019s motion to reopen, concluding that he received proper notice because he conceded he was living with his brother at the Chicago address he provided to immigration officials until October 2001, and the Notice of Hearing in Removal Proceedings was mailed in May 2001. Chang appealed to the BIA,. which entered a dismissal when Chang failed to file an appellate brief. Chang did not appeal the BIA\u2019s dismissal to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-6\">In November 2014, Chang filed with the BIA a second motion to reopen removal proceedings. In his motion, he contended that the immigration court violated his right to due process because he never actually received notice of the date of his hearing before the IJ. Thus, he argued, the order of removal should be rescinded. Chang asserted that his motion to reopen was not untimely despite the general 90 day deadline to file such a motion because, under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23, he was entitled to file a motion to reopen at any time provided he established that he never received proper notice. He also asked the BIA to exercise its authority to <em>sua sponte </em>reopen his removal proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-8\">Alternatively, Chang argued that his removal proceedings should be reopened based on changed country conditions in China. Chang alleged that he had joined the China Democracy Party (\u201cCDP\u201d) since his 2001 removal proceedings, and asserted that, if he were removed to China, he would face persecution because of his political opinion. In support, Chang noted that the Chinese government incarcerated political activists, including CDP leaders, and had increased monitoring of political activism of its citizens. He submitted evidence in support, including documents demonstrating his involvement in the CDP; news articles and a Human Rights Watch report discussing the imprisonment of CDP leaders and activists; the U.S. State Department\u2019s 2013 Human Rights Report for China (the \u201c2013 State Department Report\u201d) reporting on the imprisonment of CDP leaders and on China\u2019s policy of internet censorship; and Amnesty International\u2019s 2013 Annual Report indicating that Chinese authorities employed the country\u2019s criminal justice system to punish political activists.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-9\">The BIA denied Chang\u2019s motion to reopen. It first noted that the motion to reopen was untimely by several years and failed to qualify for any exception that would excuse the untimeliness. It concluded that Chang had not established changed country conditions because his decision to join CDP merely was a changed personal circumstance, and in any event the evidence Chang submitted did not demonstrate that conditions in China had worsened for CDP members or that the Chinese government knew of Chang\u2019s involvement in the organization. As to Chang\u2019s lack of notice argument, the BIA noted that Chang had already raised, and the IJ had rejected, the issue in his first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>motion to reopen. Even if it had not been raised previously, the BIA concluded that Chang\u2019s notice challenge failed because the hearing notice was sent to the correct address and Chang waited more than 11 years to file the second motion to reopen. Finally, the BIA declined to exercise its discretionary authority to <em>sua sponte </em>reopen Chang\u2019s removal proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">Chang now petitions this Court for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-7\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for an abuse of discretion. <em>Jiang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>568 F.3d 1252, 1256 (11th Cir.2009). Review is limited to determining whether the BIA exercised its discretion in an arbitrary or capricious manner. <em>Zhang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>572 F.3d 1316, 1319 (11th Cir.2009). The BIA\u2019s factual findings are considered \u201cconclusive unless a reasonable factfinder would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d <em>Lonyem v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>352 F.3d 1338, 1340 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b889-8\">The BIA may deny a motion to reopen on any one of three grounds: (1) the petitioner failed to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case for relief; (2) the petitioner failed to present evidence that was material and previously unavailable; or (3) the BIA determines that, despite eligibility for relief, the petitioner is not entitled to a favorable exercise of discretion. <em>Jiang, </em>568 F.3d at 1256-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-10\">Chang contends that the BIA erred in denying his motion to reopen based on lack of notice and changed country conditions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Ordinarily, a petitioner may file only one motion to reopen, and must do so no later than 90 days after the final order of removal is entered. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). It is undisputed that Chang\u2019s motion to reopen was untimely under this subsection. But if, as here, a petitioner is ordered removed <em>in absentia </em>and shows he never received notice of the removal proceeding, he is not bound by the time limitation and may file a motion to reopen at any time. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(b)(5)(C)(ii); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23(b)(4)(h). A petitioner may, however, \u201cfile only one motion\u201d alleging lack of notice. <em>Id. </em>The language of this regulation is plain. <em>See Montano Cisneros v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>514 F.3d 1224, 1228 (11th Cir. 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b889-13\">Here, Chang\u2019s first motion to reopen alleged that he failed to appear because he did not receive notice of his 2001 hearing. He accordingly was barred from raising this issue in any subsequent motion to reopen. As such, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Chang\u2019s second motion to reopen based on lack of notice as numerically barred by the plain language of 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23(b)(4)(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b889-14\">Chang also challenges the BIA\u2019s denial of his motion to reopen based on changed country conditions. The 90 day deadline to file a motion to reopen, which Chang indisputably failed to meet, does not apply where the motion is based on changed country conditions arising in the petitioner\u2019s country of nationality and the petitioner seeks asylum, withholding of re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>moval, or relief under the Convention Against Torture. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23(b)(4)(i). A motion based on changed country conditions must demonstrate that the changed conditions are material and could not have been discovered at the time of the removal proceedings. <em>Id. </em>\u201cAn alien who attempts to show that the evidence is material bears a heavy burden and must present evidence that demonstrates that, if the proceedings were opened, the new evidence would likely change the result in the case.\u201d <em>Jiang, </em>568 F.3d at 1256-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-4\">We conclude the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Chang\u2019s motion based on changed country conditions. As the BIA noted, the evidence Chang submitted reported that, rather than imposing new restrictions on CDP activists, the Chinese government has never approved of the CDP or its activities since the organization\u2019s inception in 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">Chang does not challenge this conclusion, but. argues that, even so, the evidence he submitted demonstrated an increased risk that the Chinese government would discover his activities. Specifically, he first argues that the BIA failed to consider the fact, asserted in a statement he attached to his asylum application, that his parents had been investigated and forced to flee their home in China because of his CDP involvement. Although it is true that the BIA did not specifically reference Chang\u2019s allegation, it is clear from the order that the BIA considered it. In evaluating \u201cthe evidence proffered with the respondent\u2019s motion,\u201d the BIA concluded that the motion \u201ccontains no independent evidence supporting his assertion that the Chinese government is aware of his CDP activities in this country, and it provides no details regarding the circumstances surrounding such allegation.\u201d BIA Ord. at 1-2. We are satisfied based on this discussion that the BIA gave reasoned consideration to Chang\u2019s asylum supporting statement. <em>See Tan v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>446 F.3d 1369, 1374 (11th Cir.2006) (\u2018Where the [BIA] has given reasoned consideration to the petition, and made adequate findings, we will not require that it address specifically ... each piece of evidence the petitioner presented.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). And we find no abuse of discretion in the BIA\u2019s decision to discount the statement because it was undetailed and uncorroborated. <em>See Yen Zheng Zheng v. Mukasey, </em>546 F.3d 70, 72 (1st Cir.2008) (noting that, absent substantiation, a petitioner\u2019s affidavit may have limited evidentiary value); <em>see also Yang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>418 F.3d 1198, 1201 (11th Cir.2005) (\u201cThe weaker an applicant\u2019s testimony, ... the greater the need for corroborative evidence.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b890-7\">Second, Chang contends he proffered evidence showing that the Chinese government has since 2001 increasingly restricted and monitored CDP activity on the internet. The BIA rejected this assertion, concluding that \u201cthe submitted evidence does not reveal ... that China\u2019s policy towards either published materials on the internet or traditional media or returning citizens who participated in pro-democracy activities abroad has changed.\u201d BIA Ord. at 1. Again, we cannot say this was an abuse of discretion. The evidence Chang submitted, including the 2013 State Department Report, which Chang cites in his appellate brief, demonstrated at most that the Chinese government had increased efforts to monitor activity of and restrict access to information to individuals within the country. Chang\u2019s claim is distinct from this evidence: that the Chinese government is increasingly restricting and monitoring CDP activity <em>outside </em>the country (and then punishing returning citizens upon their return to China for that conduct). He submitted no material evidence to that effect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>to the BIA. Thus, the BIA was entitled to conclude that Chang had not shown that the Chinese government might persecute him based on his internet activity conducted abroad. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1008.23(b)(4)\u00a9; <em>Jiang, </em>568 F.3d at 1256-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">The BIA was within its discretion to deny Chang\u2019s motion to reopen based on lack of notice and changed country conditions. Accordingly, we deny his petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b889-11\">. The BIA\u2019s decision dismissing Chang\u2019s appeal from the denial of his first motion to reopen is not before this Court for review. His petition for review of that decision was due 30 days after the BIA\u2019s denial. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1). This time limit is mandatory and jurisdictional and is not subject to equitable tolling. <em>Chao Lin v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>677 F.3d 1043, 1045 (11th Cir.2012). Thus, we review only the BIA\u2019s denial of Chang\u2019s second motion to reopen.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
