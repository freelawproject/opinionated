His appeal of his convictions and sentences is pending before this court. <em>United States v. Burke, </em>Case No. 1413758. On January 21, 2015, Burke, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>moved the District Court to provide him with a copy of the master jury wheel records pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1867(f)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and 1868.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court denied the motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>for lack of jurisdiction because Burke\u2019s convictions and sentences were pending on appeal in this court. Burk appeals the ruling, arguing that the court retained jurisdiction to entertain his motion because the motion\u2019s subject matter is collateral to the issues raised in the pending appeal, and that he has an unqualified right to inspect the jury records pursuant to <em>Test v. United States, </em>420 U.S. 28, 95 S.Ct. 749, 42 L.Ed.2d 786 (1975), and \u00a7 1868. We agree that the District Court had jurisdiction to hear Burke\u2019s motion but affirm its decision on the ground that neither \u00a7 1867(f) nor \u00a7 1868 provides Burke the relief he seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-5\">The filing of a notice of appeal does not prevent a district court from entertaining motions on matters collateral to the issues pending on appeal. <em>Mahone v. Ray, </em>326 F.3d 1176, 1179 (11th Cir.2003). In <em>Ma-hone, </em>the District Court retained jurisdiction to rule on a motion for sanctions under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11 because the issues were \u201ccollateral to the merits of an appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1180.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-6\">One of the purposes of the Jury Selection and Service Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1861, <em>et seq., </em>is to ensure that parties have access to juries selected at random from a fair cross section of the community. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1861; <em>United States v. Price, </em>573 F.2d 356, 360 (5th Cir.1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b903-7\">Subsection (a) of \u00a7 1867 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b903-8\">In criminal cases, before the <em>voir dire </em>examination begins, or within seven days after the defendant discovered or could have discovered, by the exercise of diligence, the grounds therefor, whichever is earlier, the defendant may move to dismiss the indictment or stay the proceedings against him on the ground of substantial failure to comply with the provisions of this title in selecting the grand or petit jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b903-12\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1867(a). The contents of records or papers used in the jury selection process may not be disclosed until after the master jury wheel has been emptied unless necessary for the preparation and pendency of a motion under subsection (a), (b), or (c).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1867(f). \u201cThe parties in a case shall be allowed to inspect, reproduce, and copy such records or papers at all reasonable times during the preparation and pendency of such a motion.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b903-13\">After the jury wheel is emptied and refilled, and after all persons selected before emptying have completed their service, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1868 requires the clerk to preserve for four years, or longer if required by court order, all records and papers compiled and maintained by the jury commission or clerk before the master wheel was emptied. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1868. Section 1868 further states that these preserved records \u201cshall be available for public inspection for the purpose of determining the validity of the selection of any jury.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b904-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>In <em>Test v. United States, </em>prior to trial, the defendant filed a motion to dismiss his indictment claiming that the master lists from which the grand jury was selected, and from which the petit jury would be selected, disproportionately excluded persons with Spanish surnames, students, and blacks. 420 U.S. at 28-29, 95 S.Ct. at 750. Attached to his motion was another motion requesting permission to inspect and copy the jury lists pertaining to his indictment. <em>Id. </em>at 29, 95 S.Ct. at 750. After the District Court denied both motions and the Court of Appeals affirmed, the Supreme Court vacated the judgment and remanded the case, concluding that the defendant was erroneously denied access to the lists. <em>Id. </em>The Court stated that the defendant had an essentially unqualified right to inspect the jury lists pursuant to \u00a7 1867(f), which grants access in order to aid parties in the preparation of their motion to dismiss. <em>Id. </em>at 30, 95 S.Ct. at 751. \u201c[Without inspection, a party almost invariably would be unable to determine whether he has a potentially meritorious jury challenge.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b904-4\">Burke is not entitled to the relief he seeks. He is not entitled to relief under \u00a7 1867(f), which governs access to .jury records before the master jury wheel has been emptied, because \u00a7 1867(f) only permits disclosure of the records during the pendency of a <em>pre-voir dire </em>motion to stay proceedings or dismiss the indictment. And Burke filed no such motion prior to the <em>voir dire </em>held at the commencement of his trial. He is not entitled to relief under \u00a7 1868 because it directs the court clerk to preserve the jury records and make them available for public inspection after the master jury wheel has been emptied, and he has failed to allege that the master jury wheel has been emptied, or that the clerk has not retained or made the records available for public inspection.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b902-10\">. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1867. Challenging compliance with selection procedures, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b902-11\">(f) The contents of records or papers used by the jury commission or clerk in connection with the jury selection process shall not be disclosed, except pursuant to the district court plan or as may be necessary in the preparation or presentation of a motion under subsection (a), (b), or (c) of this section, until after the master jury wheel has been emptied and refilled pursuant to section 1863(b)(4) of this title and all persons selected to serve as jurors before the master wheel was emptied have completed such service. The parties in a case shall be allowed to inspect, reproduce, and copy such records or papers at all reasonable times during the preparation and pendency of such a motion.
