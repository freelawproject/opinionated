The case against him rested principally on the testimony of the victim\u2019s wife, who identified Wiggins as the shooter. Wiggins sought to suppress the identification, as tainted by a suggestive photographic lineup, but his claim was rejected by the state courts. He then filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 habeas corpus petition raising the same claim, as well as another claim not at issue here, but the district court denied relief. The district court granted a certificate of appealability solely as to Wiggins\u2019s claim that the introduction of evidence relating to the suggestive identification violated his constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">We review factual findings for clear error, and we review de novo questions of law and mixed questions of law and fact. <em>Gregory v. Thaler, </em>601 F.3d 347, 352 (5th Cir.2010). We defer to the state court\u2019s decision as required by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)-(e). <em>See Ortiz v. Quarterman, </em>504 F.3d 492, 496 (5th Cir.2007). Because a state court denied Wiggins\u2019s claim on the merits, the AEDPA bars habeas relief unless Wiggins shows that the state court \u201cerred so transparently that no fairminded jurist could agree with that court\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Bobby v, Dixon, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 26, 27, 181 L.Ed.2d 328 (2011) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">The Supreme Court has held that the Constitution mandates exclusion of testimony regarding a photographic lineup only if \u201claw enforcement officers use[d] an identification procedure that is both suggestive and unnecessary\u201d and \u201cimproper police conduct created a substantial likelihood of misidentification.\u201d <em>Perry v. New Hampshire, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 716, 724, 181 L.Ed.2d 694 (2012). The state court considered the reliability of the identification of Wiggins as the shooter in light of the factors listed by the Supreme Court in <em>Manson v. Brathwaite, </em>432 U.S. 98, 114, 97 S.Ct. 2243, 53 L.Ed.2d 140 (1977). \u201cWhere the indicators of [a witness\u2019s] ability to make an accurate identification are outweighed by the corrupting effect of law enforcement suggestion, the identification should be suppressed.\u201d <em>Perry, </em>132 S.Ct. at 724. The state court determined that the identification was sufficiently reliable such that its use at trial was not unconstitutional. Given the kinds of suggestive identifications that the Supreme Court has concluded are constitutionally admissible, <em>see, e.g., Brathwaite, </em>432 U.S. at 104-17, 97 S.Ct. 2243, Wiggins fails to show that the reliability of the identification in his case was so clearly outweighed by the corrupting effect of the challenged identification procedure that \u201cno fairminded jurist could agree\u201d with the state court\u2019s decision. <em>Dixon, </em>132 S.Ct. at 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b480-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
