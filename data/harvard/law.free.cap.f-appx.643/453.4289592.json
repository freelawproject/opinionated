Jones, </em>633 F. App\u2019x 259, 2016 WL 556533, is WITHDRAWN, and the following is substituted in its place.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-21\">Proceeding <em>pro se, </em>Kenneth A. Jones, federal prisoner # 26216-077, challenges the denial of his motion, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c), for a sentencing reduction. The underlying sentence was imposed in 1995, when Jones was sentenced to 310 months\u2019 imprisonment after previously pleading guilty to conspiracy to possess, with intent to distribute, one kilogram or more of methamphetamine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841 and 846.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-22\">On 17 June 2015, following Jones\u2019 \u00a7 3582(c) motion (in which he asserted Sentencing Guideline Amendment 782 entitled him to a reduction), the United States Probation Office prepared a worksheet, recommending: Jones\u2019 total offense level could be reduced from 35 to 31; and, his Guidelines sentencing range could be reduced to 188 to 235 months\u2019 imprisonment. But, in denying the motion, the district court concluded Amendment 782 did not lower his offense level or sentencing range.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-23\">On 11 February 2016, this court, through the above-referenced now withdrawn opinion, relied on, <em>inter alia, </em>the 17 June worksheet and vacated the denial of Jones\u2019 motion. Shortly thereafter, however, the record was supplemented to include a 1 July 2015 amended worksheet, which stated that Amendment 782 did <em>not </em>change Jones\u2019 total offense level or his sentencing range. The amended worksheet Ayas utilized by the district court in considering <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>Jones\u2019 motion. Accordingly, we now consider his challenges in the light of the supplemented record and his supplemental brief addressing the 1 July amended worksheet.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">The denial of a motion for reduction of a sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>E.g., United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2009). Amendment 782 revised the Guidelines applicable to drug-trafficking offenses by changing the base-offense levels in Guideline \u00a7 2D1.1. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G., Supp. to Appendix C, Amendment 782, Reason for Amendment. But, sentencing \u201creductions under ... \u00a7 3582(c)(2) are not mandatory ... [and] merely give[ ] the district court discretion to reduce a sentence under limited circumstances\u201d. <em>United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 238 (5th Cir.2009). If the court gave due consideration to the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion and the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, there is no abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d 1007, 1010 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">In his supplemental brief, Jones concedes he is not entitled to a reduced sentence if the 1 July amended worksheet\u2019s calculation of his Guidelines sentencing range is correct. A review of that amended worksheet and Jones\u2019 1995 sentence (calculated pursuant to the 1994 Guidelines) shows Amendment 782 does not lower that range. The court did not abuse its discretion in denying Jones\u2019 motion for a sentencing reduction. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B); <em>United States v. Henderson, </em>636 F.3d 713, 717-18 (5th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b475-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
