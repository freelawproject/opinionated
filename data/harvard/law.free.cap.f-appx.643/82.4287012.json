As the appeal does not present a substantial question, we will summarily affirm the decision of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-20\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-21\">Spearman initiated this \u00a7 1983 action in 2014 against Lieutenant Alan Morris and-Correctional Officer W. Hollowood, both employees at.-SCI-Waynesburg, asserting a variety of. constitutional claims based on their' alleged involvement in the destruction of his legal documents and subsequent threats they directed at him.</p>\n<p id=\"Ako\">According to Spearman\u2019s complaint, on February 2, 2014, Hollowood threatened to move him to a \u201chard cell\u201d if Spearman did not stop filing grievances related to his lost legal documents,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and also allegedly advised Spearman that \u201che thr[ew] [Spear-man\u2019s] legal work in the trash\u201d to ensure he would lose his case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On February 3, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>2014, Spearman filed grievance number 49606, listing the above allegations against Hollowood. On February 11, 2014, the grievance office denied Spearman\u2019s grievance, citing a lack of evidence. Spearman appealed this decision on February 18, 2014, and on March 6, 2014, the facility manager upheld the initial denial, also citing a lack of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">On April 21, 2014, the Secretary\u2019s Office of Inmate Grievances and Appeals declined to exercise final review over Spearman\u2019s appeal of the facility manager\u2019s decision because Spearman did not attach the required documentation with his appeal, including a copy/ of the initial grievance and subsequent responses. The Secretary\u2019s response advised Spearman, in an \u201caction required\u201d notice, that if he did not submit these forms within fifteen days, his appeal would be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">Meanwhile, on February ' 12, 2014, Spearman filed grievance number 497318 against Defendant Morris, alleging that Morris \u201cblackmailed\u201d and threatened him into withdrawing a previously filed grievance concerning his lost legal documents. The grievance officer denied this grievance on February 24, 2014, citing a lack of evidence. Spearman appealed on February 26, 2014, and on March 3, 2013, the facility manager upheld the initial denial. On March 28, 2014, the Secretary\u2019s office again declined to exercise final review over Spearman\u2019s appeal because Spearman failed to attach the required documentation. The office advised him that his appeal would be dismissed if he did not attach the required documents within fifteen days.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">Spearman acknowledges that he received both \u201caction required\u201d notices from the Secretary\u2019s office, but \u201cswear[s] under oath\u201d that he \u201cfiled all copies of my initial grievance; all responses and all appeals, as well as a brief appeal to the (S.O.I.G.A.) [for both grievances] within the time frame.\u201d He further indicates that he \u201csent the copies to the central office for forwarding because of threats [he\u2019s] been receiving.\u201d Curiously, Spearman also contends that his \u201cfailure to comply properly with the exhaustion requirement [for both grievances] was caused by illegal actions by the name[d] Defendants by threatening; retaliation &amp; wrongdoing to prevent the plaintiff from properly completing the exhaustion requirements.\u201d The District Court record does not contain any of Spearman\u2019s appeals to the Secretary\u2019s office, only the \u201caction required\u201d notices sent to Spearman.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-10\">Defendants filed a motion to dismiss on August 6, 2016, arguing that Spearman failed to exhaust his administrative remedies because he never properly appealed to final review. The District Court treated this as a motion for summary judgment, and in an October 7, 2015 Report and Recommendation, recommended that Defendants\u2019 motion be granted. On October 29, 2015 the District Court granted Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment and adopted the Report and Recommendation as the opinion of the Court. Spearman filed a timely notice of appeal from this order on November 19, 2015.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-12\">We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We exercise plenary review over a district court award of summary judgment and apply the same test the district court should have applied \u2014 whether the record \u201cshows that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Giles v. Kearney, </em>571 F.3d 318, 322 (3d Cir.2009). In applying this test, we must accept evidence presented by the non-movant as true and draw all justifiable factual inferences in hjs favor. <em>Id. </em>We may summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s award of summary judgment where \u201cit clearly appears that no substantial question is presented or that subsequent precedent or a change in circumstances warrants such action.\u201d 3d Cir. I.O.P. 10.6 (2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">The District Court correctly granted Defendants motion for summary judgment because Spearman failed to exhaust his administrative remedies as required by the Prison Litigation Reform Act (\u201cPLRA\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">Section 1997e of the PLRA provides, in part, that \u201c[n]o action shall be brought with respect to prison conditiohs under section 1983 of this title ... until such administrative remedies as are . available are exhausted.\u201d This exhaustion requirement is an affirmative defense, and entry of summary judgment on such a ground is appropriate only when the moving party presents \u201cevidence that would entitle [it] to a directed verdict if not controverted at trial.\u201d <em>In re Bressman, </em>327 F.3d 229, 237 (3d Cir.2003) (quoting <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 331, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-8\">DC-ADM 804, which governs the grievance and appeals process in Pennsylvania correctional institutions, provides for a three-step process, with final review of grievances performed by the Secretary\u2019s office. This Court has frequently observed that a plaintiff must follow <em>each </em>of these steps to exhaust his administrative remedies under the PLRA. <em>Booth v. Churner, </em>206 F.3d 289, 299 (3d Cir.2000) (plaintiff \u201cdid not take full advantage of the administrative procedures available to him\u201d in failing to use steps two and three of DC-ADM 804); <em>Jenkins v. Morton, </em>148 F.3d 257, 259 (3d Cir.1998) (discussing California and Illinois grievance procedures similar to DC-ADM 804 and concluding that exhaustion occurs only after completion of final step). In addition, \u201c[pjroper exhaustion demands compliance with' an agency\u2019s deadlines and other critical procedural rules.\u201d <em>Woodford v. Ngo, </em>548 U.S. 81, 90, 126 S.Ct. 2378, 165 L.Ed.2d 368 (2006). Because Spearman never perfected his appeal for final review according to applicable procedures, he has failed to exhaust his administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-9\">Spearman adopted seemingly inconsistent positions to oppose Defendants\u2019 motion. In his response to Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss, he \u201cswear[s] under oath [that hej filed all copies of [his] initial grievance; all responses and all appeals as well as a brief appeal to the (S.O.I.G.A.) [for both grievances] within the time frame,\u201d and concludes that \u201cI believe that I exhausted all my administrative remedies.\u201d But in his objections to the Report and Recommendation, he states that his \u201cfailure to comply properly with the exhaustion requirement [for both grievances] was- caused by illegal actions by the name[d] Defendants by threatening; retaliation &amp; wrongdoing to prevent the plaintiff from properly completing the exhaustion requirements.\u201d These bare, contradictory allegations are insufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact. <em>Sec. &amp; Exch. Comm\u2019n v. Bonastia, </em>614 F.2d 908, 914 (3d Cir.1980). (\u201cDenials in the form of legal conclusions, unsupported by documentation of specific facts, are insufficient to create issues of material fact that would preclude summary judgment-.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-10\">Accordingly, we will affirm the decision of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b105-11\"> This disposition is not an opinion of.jhe full Court and pursuant to I.O.P. 5.7 does not constitute binding precedent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b105-12\">. Hollowood\u2019s threat regarding the filing of grievances appears to be related to a request Spearman filed to library staff on January 27, 2014'conceming lost legal documents.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b105-25\">. Though it is not clear from the complaint, state court records indicate that Spearman was charged in June of 2014 with criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>homicide and related charges for an incident that occurred at SCI-Waynesburg. Spear-man appears to suggest in his complaint that Hollowood destroyed his legal work to handicap Spearman\u2019s defense in this matter.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
