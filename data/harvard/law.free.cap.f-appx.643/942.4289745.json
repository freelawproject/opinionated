The Tax Court concluded it lacked jurisdiction over the petition because the petition had been untimely filed. No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b965-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"943\">*943</page-number>The facts of this case are not in dispute. On 15 January 2014, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue sent to Petitioners by certified mail a valid notice of income tax deficiency. The notice said expressly that the last day to challenge the deficiency determination was 15 April 2014. On 14 April 2014, Petitioners\u2019 representative mailed the petition to the Tax Court via FedEx Express Saver. The petition was received and filed by the Tax Court on 16 April 2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-5\">A taxpayer seeking to challenge a deficiency determination must file with the Tax Court a petition for redetermination \u201c[w]ithin 90 days ... after the notice of deficiency ... is mailed.\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6213(a), (c). \u201c[T]imely filing of such a petition is a jurisdictional prerequisite for a suit in the tax court.\u201d <em>Pugsley v. Comm\u2019r, </em>749 F.2d 691, 692 (11th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b965-6\">We agree with the Tax Court\u2019s determination that the 90-day limitations period began to run on 16 January: the day after the notice of deficiency was mailed to Petitioners. In computing times established by the tax code, \u201cthe day of the act, event or default from which a period of time begins to run shall not be included, and ... the last day of the period so computed shall be included.\u201d Tax Ct. R. 25(a). Here, the \u201cact\u201d or \u201cevent\u201d from which the limitations period began to run was the date the deficiency notice was mailed (15 January). <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6213(a). Thus, under the plain language of Rule 25(a), the 90-day limitation period in Petitioner\u2019s case began to run on 16 January and ended on 15 April. <em>See, e.g., Sarkissian v. Comm\u2019r, </em>T.C.M. 2012-278, *3-4 (2012) (where notice of deficiency was mailed on 29 July 2011, the \u201c90th and last day\u201d to file a petition \u2014 counting the first day as 30 July \u2014 was 27 October 2011); <em>Appiah v. Comm\u2019r, </em>T.C.M. 1996-170, *8 (1996) (in computing the limitations period under section 6213(a) and Rule 25(a), \u201cit is accurate to count as the first day, the day after the notice of deficiency is mailed.\u201d). This interpretation is further supported by Rule 25(a)\u2019s provision that \u201c[i]f service is made by mail, then a period of time computed with respect to the service shall begin on the day after the date of the mailing.\u201d <em>See </em>Tax Ct. R. 25(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b965-8\">Petitioners next contend that their petition \u2014 even if received by the Tax Court after the expiration of the 90-day period \u2014 should be deemed timely filed pursuant to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7502. \u201cUnder [section 7502], if a taxpayer sends his petition for delivery to the Court \u2018by United States mail\u2019 within the prescribed period for filing the petition and the Court receives the petition after the period has ended, the date of the USPS postmark on the envelope containing the petition will be considered the date of delivery.\u201d <em>Eichelburg v. Comm\u2019r, </em>T.C.M. 2013-269, *5-6 (2013). This \u201ctimely-mailed, timely-filed\u201d rule has also been extended to certain \u201cprivate delivery services\u201d \u201cif such service is designated by the Secretary for purposes of [section 7502].\u201d <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7502(f) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b965-9\">Petitioners acknowledge that FedEx Express Saver has not been designated by the Secretary for purposes of section 7502. <em>Cf. </em>Notice 2004-83, 2004-2 C.B. 1030 (listing the private delivery services designated by the Secretary at all times pertinent to this appeal). Petitioners argue, however, that the \u201ctimely-mailed, timely-filed\u201d rule should apply here because FedEx Express Saver \u2014 although not designated formally by the Secretary \u2014 satisfies several of the criteria required of designated private delivery services.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-10\">Petitioner\u2019s argument is foreclosed both by the plain statutory language and by pertinent case law. <em>See, e.g., </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7502(f) (defining \u201cdesignated delivery service\u201d as \u201cany delivery service provided by a trade or business if such service is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"944\">*944</page-number>designated by the Secretary for purposes of this section.\u201d (emphasis added)); <em>Eichelburg, </em>T.C.M. 2013-269, at *7 (concluding expressly that \u201cFedEx Express Saver is not a \u2018designated private delivery service\u2019 within the meaning of section 7502(f)\u201d because it is not listed among the designated private delivery services identified in Notice 2004-83); <em>Scaggs v. Comm\u2019r, </em>T.C.M. 2012-258, *5 (2012) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b966-4\">Petitioners also argue that the \u201ctimely-mailed, timely-filed\u201d rule should apply because Petitioners\u2019 representative relied reasonably on representations of a Federal Express employee that the petition would be delivered to the Tax Court by \u201cthe next day.\u201d This argument is without merit. The T^x Court \u201cmay not rely on general equitable principles to expand the statutorily prescribed time for filing a petition\u201d and may apply the \u201ctimely-mailed, timely-filed\u201d rule \u201conly if a private delivery service has been \u2018designated by the Secretary.\u2019 \u201d <em>Eichelburg, </em>T.C.M. 2013-269, at *8.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b964-19\"> We review <em>de novo </em>the Tax Court\u2019s legal conclusions, including whether it has subject matter jurisdiction, and review for clear error the Tax Court\u2019s factual findings. <em>See Campbell v. Comm\u2019r of IR, </em>658 F.3d 1255, 1258 (11th Cir.2011).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
