Harris filed a motion for a reduction of his sentence, under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), in light of Sentencing Guidelines Amendment 782, which reduced penalties for certain drug trafficking offenses. The motion was granted, and Harris\u2019s sentence of imprisonment was reduced to 220 months. Harris filed a second motion for a further reduction of his sentence asking that his sentence be reduced from 220 months to 188 months, the low end of the amended guideline range. The district court denied the second motion, noting that it had granted his previous motion and stating that no further reduction was warranted. Harris appealed from the second order denying a further reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">The district court certified that the appeal was not taken in good faith, and it denied Harris\u2019s motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) on appeal. Harris has challenged the district court\u2019s certification decision by applying to this court for leave to proceed IFP on appeal. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). Our inquiry \u201cis limited to whether the appeal involves \u2018legal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u2019\u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-12\">Harris argues that the district court erred in its analysis of the reduction of his term of imprisonment under \u00a7 3582(e) and that the district court did not properly consider all the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) when imposing the new sentence. He contends that the district court should have applied the analysis required in <em>Pepper v. United States, </em>562 U.S. 476, 131 S.Ct. 1229, 179 L.Ed.2d 196 (2011), by considering his post-sentencing rehabilitation evidence and other evidence concerning his conduct since his last sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-13\">The district court\u2019s order ruling on a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2009). The district court\u2019s first order stated that the court had considered Harris\u2019s motion, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 (p.s.), and the sentencing factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a). In its order denying Harris\u2019s motion for a further reduction, the district court stated that it had reviewed the motion and the file in his case and concluded that no further reduction was warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-14\">A sentencing court is not required to explain its application of the statutory sentencing factors in ruling on a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>United States v. Henderson, </em>636 F.3d 713, 718 (5th Cir.2011) (discussing <em>Evans, </em>587 F.3d at 673). \u201cThe court, which was under no obligation to reduce [Harris\u2019s] sentence at all, was under no obligation to reduce it even further within the recalculated range.\u201d <em>Evans, </em>587 F.3d at 673 (footnotes omitted). Further, \u201ca defendant cannot successfully challenge a district court for failing to provide reasons ... for <em>granting </em>his [\u00a7 3582(c)(2) ] motion but not providing a satisfactorily low <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>enough sentence within the recalculated range.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 674 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">As for Harris\u2019s argument that the district court should have applied the analysis in <em>Pepper, </em>the holding in <em>Pepper </em>applied to the consideration of post-sentencing rehabilitation when resentencing after a defendant\u2019s sentence had been vacated on appeal, not on a motion to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c). <em>See </em>562 U.S. at 490, 131 S.Ct. 1229.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">Harris has failed to show that his appeal involves a nonfrivolous issue. <em>See Howard, </em>707 F.2d at 220. His motion for leave to proceed IFP on appeal is DENIED. Because the appeal is frivolous, it is DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2; <em>see also Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b363-9\"> Pursuant to 5th C\u00ede. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
