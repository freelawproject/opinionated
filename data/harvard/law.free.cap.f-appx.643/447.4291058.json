The district court sentenced Collins to concurrent terms of 480 months of imprisonment on Count One and 240 months of imprisonment on Count Five.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-21\">Collins has filed a motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) on appeal from the district court\u2019s denial of his 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for a sentence reduction based, on Amendment 782 to the Sentencing Guidelines. The district court denied his IFP motion and certified that the appeal was not taken in good faith. By moving for IFP status,.Collins is challenging the district court\u2019s certification. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-22\">Collins contends that the district court erred in concluding that he was ineligible for a sentence reduction under Amendment 782 because the court\u2019s decision was based on its erroneous assessment of the Sentencing Guidelines. Specifically, he argues that the district court misapplied the Sentencing Guidelines at his original sentencing by: (1) applying the four-level aggravating role enhancement to the money laundering offense level; (2) grouping the money laundering and drug counts; and (3) using the erroneous money laundering guidelines range to sentence him on the drug count. According to Collins, had he been properly sentenced, Amendment 782 would have lowered his guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-23\">Claims regarding the calculation and constitutionality of Collins\u2019s original sentence are not cognizable in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>See Dillon v. United States, </em>560 U.S. 817, 825-26, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010); <em>United States v. Hernandez, </em>645 F.3d 709, 712 (5th Cir.2011). Further, the record reflects that Collins was not sentenced based on the drug quantity table set forth in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c). Thus, the district court correctly concluded that he was not eligible for a sentence reduction under Amend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>ment 782, <em>see United States v. Anderson, </em>591 F.3d 789, 790-91 (5th Cir.2009), and Collins has not shown that the district court erred in denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, <em>see United States v. Henderson, </em>636 F.3d 713, 717 (5th Cir.2011). Because he has failed to show that his appeal involves legal points arguable on their merits, <em>see Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983), Collins\u2019s IFP motion is denied, and his appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 <em>&amp; </em>n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">In the alternative, Collins seeks authorization from this court to file a successive 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion challenging his 2001 conviction. He seeks to argue that the district court\u2019s sentencing errors and denial of his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion rendered his sentence unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">Collins has failed to make a prima facie showing that his claims rely on either (1) \u201cnewly discovered evidence that, if proven and viewed in light of the evidence as a whole, would be sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that no reasonable factfinder would have found [him] guilty of the offense[s]\u201d or (2) \u201ca new rule of constitutional law, made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court, that was previously unavailable.\u201d \u00a7 2255(h); <em>see In re Webster, </em>605 F.3d 256, 257-58 (5th Cir.2010). Accordingly, his alternative motion for authorization to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">MOTIONS DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b469-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
