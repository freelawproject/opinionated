On appeal, she challenges the weight the ALJ accorded to the medical opinion evidence, specifically arguing that the ALJ erred by assigning no weight to the opinion of her treating psychiatrist and improperly substituted his own opinion for the opinion of her consulting psychologist. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-13\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b865-14\">In May 2011, Whitton filed an application for disability insurance benefits with the Social Security Administration. Alleging a disability onset date of January 1, 2009, Whitton represented that she was unable to work because of migraines, high blood pressure, chronic back and knee pain, depression, and stress-induced boils.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-16\">The Commissioner of Social Security (\u201cthe Commissioner\u201d) denied Whitton\u2019s application for benefits. At a subsequent hearing before the ALJ in March 2013, the ALJ heard testimony from Whitton, Whit-ton\u2019s husband, and a vocational expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-17\">Whitton testified that she had not worked since October 2010, and amended her disability onset date to October 27, 2010. While she left her previous job because the business closed, she had planned to leave because of knee and back pain. Her mother also passed away in October 2010, and she was having trouble dealing with the loss. She received treatment for anxiety and depression at a mental health facility, but the medications she received did not help her.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-19\">Whitton stated that she also had trouble sleeping and eating, she could not concentrate to watch a two-hour movie, she had little energy, and sometimes she had trouble bathing and getting dressed without assistance. She suffered from panic attacks approximately three times per week. Because her husband was in an accident in 2008, Whitton had to cook for him, help him get dressed, give him shots, and make sure he took his medication. She also stated that she drove herself to the hearing, which was a 45-minute drive from her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>home, without any problems. Moreover, she handled most of the family\u2019s finances.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-4\">Following the hearing, the ALJ issued a decision, concluding that Whitton was not disabled for purposes of eligibility for disability insurance benefits. Upon review of the evidence, the ALJ found that Whitton suffered from lumbago, hypertension, depression, and anxiety, but he determined that these impairments did not meet or equal any of the listed impairments in the Social Security regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">The ALJ further concluded that Whitton could perform light work, but that she needed' to avoid heights, dangerous or moving equipment, as well as ropes, ladders, and scaffolds. Her work should also be limited to simple tasks, interaction with co-workers should be casual, and' she should not have any exposure to the general public. The ALJ also reviewed the medical evidence, including the opinions of Whitton\u2019s treating psychiatrist, Dr. Richard Grant, who opined that Whitton was severely limited in all areas of functioning, as well as the opinion of her consulting psychologist, Dr. David Wilson, who diagnosed Whitton with borderline intellectual functioning. The ALJ gave no weight to these opinions because Whitton did not see either doctor until after her date last insured, and because the medical opinions were inconsistent with the record as a whole, including the doctors\u2019 own treatment notes.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-6\">Based on the finding that Whitton could perform light work, in addition to the vocational expert\u2019s opinion that a significant number of jobs accommodating Whitton\u2019s limitations existed in the national economy, the ALJ concluded that Whitton was not disabled. The Appeals Council denied Whitton\u2019s request for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-7\">In August 2014, Whitton filed a complaint in the district court challenging the denial of disability insurance benefits. She argued, among other things, that the ALJ did not accord proper weight to .the opinions of Drs. Grant and Wilson. The district court affirmed the Commissioner\u2019s decision denying benefits, concluding in relevant part that the ALJ\u2019s evaluation of the medical evidence was in accordance with the relevant legal standards and was supported by substantial evidence. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-9\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b866-10\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b866-11\">We review the ALJ\u2019s decision for substantial evidence, but its application of legal principles <em>de novo. Moore v. Barnhart, 405 F.3d </em>1208, 1211 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla and is such relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Crawford v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>363 F.3d 1155, 1158 (11th Cir.2004) (quotations omitted). We may not reweigh the evidence and decide the facts anew, and must defer to the ALJ\u2019s decision if it is supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Dyer v. Barnhart, </em>395 F.3d 1206, 1210 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b866-12\">B. Process for Determining Eligibility for Disability Insurance Benefits</p>\n<p id=\"b866-13\">To be eligible for disability insurance benefits, a claimant must establish that she was under disability on or before the last date for which she was insured. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(a)(1)(A), (c)(1), <em>Moore, </em>405 F.3d at 1211. Because Whitton\u2019s last insured date was December 31, 2010, she must show that she was disabled on or before that date. <em>See Moore, </em>405 F.3d at 1211.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-14\">Under the five-step sequential evaluation process used to determine if a claimant has demonstrated a disability, the ALJ considers: (1) whether the claimant is en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>gaging in substantial gainful activity; (2) if not, whether the claimant has a severe impairment or combination of impairments; (3) if so, whether the claimant\u2019s impairments meet or equal a listed impairment; (4) if not, whether the claimant is able to do her past relevant work; and (5) if not, whether the claimant, in light of her age, education, and work experience, can perform other work in the national economy. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(a)(4); <em>Phillips v. Barnhart, </em>357 F.3d 1232, 1237 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">C. Weight ALJ Assigned to Medical Opinion Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">To determine whether a disability exists, the ALJ considers the medical opinions in the record, in addition to the other relevant evidence in the record. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(b). The ALJ must give the opinion of a treating physician \u201csubstantial or considerable weight\u201d unless there is good cause not to do so. <em>Winschel v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>631 F.3d 1176, 1179 (11th Cir.2011) (quotations omitted); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(c)(2) (stating that the opinion of a treating physician will be given controlling weight if it is supported by medically acceptable and laboratory diagnostic techniques and is not inconsistent with the other substantial evidence in the record).</p>\n<p id=\"b867-7\">We have concluded that good cause exists for affording l\u00e9ss weight to a treating physician\u2019s opinion when the: \u201c(1) treating physician\u2019s opinion was not bolstered by the evidence; (2) evidence supported a contrary finding; or (3) treating physician\u2019s opinion was eonclusory or inconsistent with the doctor\u2019s own medical records.\u201d <em>Phillips, </em>357 F.3d at 1240-41. Moreover, the opinion of a treating physician may be entitled to less weight when the physician\u2019s assessment conflicts with a claimant\u2019s own reported daily activities. <em>See id. </em>If the ALJ chooses to assign less weight to a treating physician\u2019s opinion, he must clearly articulate his reasons for doing so. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b867-9\">1. <em>Opinion of Whitton\u2019s Treating Psychiatrist</em></p>\n<p id=\"b867-10\">Whitton argues that the ALJ did not give proper weight to the opinion of her treating psychiatrist, Dr. Grant, and instead substituted his own opinion for that of Dr. Grant.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-11\">Whitton\u2019s case record includes a November 2012 mental health source statement completed by Dr. Grant, in which he opined that Whitton had marked and extreme limitations in all areas of understanding and memory, sustained concentration and persistence, social interaction, and adaptation. In a disability questionnaire also dated November 2012, Dr. Grant concluded that Whitton was disabled, that the disability began before March 2012, and that the disability was based on the following impairments: a diminished mental capacity, an inability to cope with daily stressors, and severe recurrent depression. Dr. Grant also stated that Whitton exhibited \u201cagoraphobic behaviors\u201d and her mental health issues were of \u201csuch intensity\u201d that it made it difficult for her to cope with the activities of daily life. The ALJ gave no weight to Dr. Grant\u2019s opinion because it was inconsistent with the other evidence in the record, including Dr. Grant\u2019s treatment notes, and because the report and questionnaire were dated long after the date Whitton was last insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-12\">We conclude that substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s articulation of good cause for giving no weight to Dr. Grant\u2019s opinion that Whitton was severely limited in all areas of functioning. First, Dr. Grant did not treat Whitton during the relevant time period, as Whitton did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>begin receiving treatment from him until March 2012, which was more than one year after her date last insured \u2014 December 31, 2010. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(a)(1)(A), (c)(1); <em>Moore, </em>405 F.3d at 1211 (providing that a claimant must demonstrate disability on or before the date last insured to demonstrate eligibility for disability insurance benefits). Although Dr. Grant stated that Whitton had suffered from moderate depression for 15 years and listed her disability onset date as' before March 22, 2012, he never evaluated the severity of her conditions during the relevant time period.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\">Even if Dr. Grant\u2019s opinion applied to the relevant time period, good cause still existed for assigning no weight to his opinion. In particular, Dr. Grant\u2019s own treatment notes contradicted his opinion that Whitton was severely depressed and had marked or extreme limitations in all areas of functioning. <em>See Phillips, </em>357 F.3d at 1241. His treatment notes from June 2012 show that Whitton\u2019s insight and judgment were fair, her thought process was logical, her thought content was within the normal limits, and she exhibited appropriate behavior. Likewise, in his notes from December 2012 \u2014 only one month after opining that Whitton had marked or extreme limitations in all functioning areas \u2014 Dr. Grant indicated that Whitton\u2019s sleep patterns, attention and concentration, appetite, and energy had all improved.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">The ALJ\u2019s decision to give no weight to Dr. Grant\u2019s opinion is also supported by other evidence in the record. Although the record contains limited evidence related to Whitton\u2019s treatment from before the date she was last insured, the evidence that is in the record indicates that she received treatment at Quality of Life Health Services, Inc. in October 2010, and reported no issues with memory, interaction, or concentration. In a subsequent visit in November 2010, Whitton presented with normal affect, insight, judgment, attention span, and concentration, and reported no issues with memory.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-7\">Additionally, Dr. Grant's opinion conflicted with Whitton\u2019s own description of her daily activities. <em>See Phillips, </em>357 F.3d at 1241. Although Dr. Grant opined that the severity of Whitton\u2019s mental health issues severely limited her daily life activities, Whitton stated on her application for disability benefits that she cooks breakfast, washes dishes, makes the bed, mops the floor, and gives her husband shots and takes him to doctor\u2019s appointments. She also testified that she drove to the disability hearing, which was a 45-minute drive from her home, and handled most of the family\u2019s finances.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-8\">We therefore reject Whitton\u2019s contentions on appeal that the ALJ substituted his own opinion for that of Dr. Grant, as the record shows that the ALJ considered all of the medical evidence, clearly articulated reasons for rejecting Dr. Grant\u2019s opinion, and those reasons are supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Sryock v. Heckler, </em>764 F.2d 834, 835 (11th Cir.1985) (stating that \u201cthe ALJ is free to reject the opinion of any physician when the evidence supports a contrary conclusion\u201d). Based on the inconsistencies between Dr. Grant\u2019s opinion and the record, including Dr. Grant\u2019s own treatment notes, the ALJ had good cause for assigning no weight to the opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-9\">2. <em>Opinion of Whitton\u2019s Consulting Psychologist</em></p>\n<p id=\"b868-10\">Whitton asserts that the ALJ improperly substituted his own opinion for the opinion of Whitton\u2019s consulting psychologist, Dr. Wilson.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-11\">The record includes a November 2012 psychological evaluation from Dr. Wilson, in which he diagnosed Whitton with major <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>depressive disorder, recurrent panic disorder, and borderline intellectual functioning. Moreover, in a January 2013 mental health source statement, Dr. Wilson opined that Whitton had marked and extreme limitations in almost all areas of functioning. However, he further opined that she was only mildly or moderately limited in (1) the ability to understand, remember, and carry out short, simple instructions, and (2) the ability to ask simple questions and request assistance. The ALJ gave no weight to Dr. Wilson\u2019s opinion, concluding that his examination and opinion occurred after Whitton\u2019s date last insured. Additionally, the ALJ noted that Dr. Wilson\u2019s opinion was inconsistent with his own examination of Whitton and was not supported by other evidence in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">Similar to the ALJ\u2019s rejection of Dr. Grant\u2019s opinion, we conclude that the ALJ did not substitute his own opinion for Dr. Wilson\u2019s because substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s articulation of good cause for assigning no weight to that opinion. As the ALJ correctly stated, Dr. Wilson\u2019s psychological evaluation and mental health source statement, which were dated November 2012 and January 2013, respectively, were rendered after Whitton\u2019s date last insured, and did not address the severity of Whitton\u2019s conditions during the relevant time period. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(a)(1)(A), (c)(1); <em>Moore, </em>405 F.3d at 1211. More importantly, Dr. Wilson\u2019s opinion was inconsistent with his own examination of Whitton. Following his examination, Dr. Wilson diagnosed Whitton with borderline intellectual functioning and ultimately concluded that Whitton had significant medical problems that would cause difficulty in a work environment. Yet, he stated in the psychological evaluation that Whitton reported that she had done \u201cexcellent\u201d in school, but had dropped out in the 10th grade because she got married. Moreover, despite not obtaining a GED, Whit-ton received a degree in Office Business Education from the USA Training Academy in Hoover and \u201cgraduated at the top of the class.\u201d As if that were not enough, Whitton was an office manager for approximately eight years, six of which were at a security firm.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-7\">Likewise, in the January 2013 mental health source statement, he opined that Whitton was markedly limited in the ability to understand and remember detailed instructions and extremely limited in almost all areas of sustained concentration and persistence. However, in his evaluation of Whitton, he concluded that she had good mental control, attention, and concentration, as well as an adequate short term memory. Because Dr. Wilson\u2019s examination of Whitton was clearly at odds with his ultimate findings and conclusions, substantial evidence supported the ALJ\u2019s decision to give it no weight. <em>See Crawford, </em>363 F.3d at 1159 (concluding that substantial evidence supported the ALJ\u2019s rejection of treating physician\u2019s medical opinion in part because it was inconsistent with physician\u2019s own treatment notes).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-8\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b869-9\">For all of the above reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s order affirming the Commissioner\u2019s denial of Whitton\u2019s application for disability insurance benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
