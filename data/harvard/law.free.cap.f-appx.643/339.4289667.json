A079680001) filed this pro <em>se </em>action, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, against several employees of the Louisiana Caddo Correctional Center (CCC), claiming, <em>inter alia, </em>violations of his right to religious freedom under the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The district court: dismissed Om-ran\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted and as frivolous; and permitted him to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>(IFP) on appeal. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915, 1915A. Because Omran again proceeds <em>pro se, </em>his brief is entitled to liberal. construction; however, his contentions must be briefed to be preserved. <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 225 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-21\">The dismissal of a complaint as frivolous under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) is reviewed for abuse of discretion; a dismissal under \u00a7 1915A is reviewed <em>de novo. Geiger v. Jowers, </em>404 F.3d 371, 373 (5th Cir.2005). Because the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendations, later adopted by the district court, referenced both statutes, the issues are reviewed <em>de novo. Id. </em>A plaintiff fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted where he fails to show \u201cenough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face\u201d. <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007). A complaint is \u201cfrivolous if it does not have an arguable basis in fact or law\u201d. <em>Brewster v. Dretke, </em>587 F.3d 764, 767 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-22\">Under the First Amendment, as incorporated by the Fourteenth, prison officials must afford prisoners \u201creasonable opportunities\u201d to exercise their religious freedom. <em>Pedraza v. Meyer, </em>919 F.2d 317, 320 (5th Cir.1990). And, to state a Four<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>teenth-Amendment equal-protection claim, Omran must allege \u201cpurposeful discrimination resulting in a discriminatory effect among persons similarly situated\u201d. <em>Adkins v. Kaspar, </em>393 F.3d 559, 566 (5th Cir.2004) (quoting <em>Muhammad v. Lynaugh, </em>966 F.2d 901, 903 (5th Cir.1992)). The Fourteenth Amendment, however, \u201cdoes not demand that every religious sect or group within a prison ... have identical facilities or personnel\u201d. <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">Omran\u2019s religious-freedom assertions hinge on CCC Deputy Metrejean\u2019s statement that Omran could not set up a study table, without prior permission, in a recreation area to read the Quran. Following that incident, however, CCC officials told the Deputy that Omran was allowed to set up his table, and Omran does not allege any. further interference with his ability to practice his religion. A prisoner\u2019s constitutional right to freely exercise his religion is not violated by the occasional inability to practice. <em>Williams v. Bragg, </em>537 Fed.Appx. 468, 468 (5th Cir.2013) (citing <em>Green v. McKaskle, </em>788 F.2d 1116, 1126 (5th Cir.1986)). Furthermore, Omran alleged no facts showing any CCC 'regulation or policy prohibited his exercise of religion or denied him a reasonable opportunity to exercise his religious beliefs. <em>See, e.g., Freeman v. Tex. Dep\u2019t of Criminal Justice, </em>369 F.3d 854, 862 (5th Cir.2004); <em>Pedraza, </em>919 F.2d at 320.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">Additionally, Omran fails to state a claim against Sheriff Prator, because he makes no allegations against him. <em>See Samford v. Dretke, </em>562 F.3d 674, 678 (5th Cir.2009). His retaliation claim against Deputy Metrejean is raised for the first time on appeal, and therefore is not considered. <em>Yohey, </em>985 F.2d at 225. Finally, Omran fails to brief his Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act claim on appeal, and has therefore abandoned it. <em>Id. </em>at 224-25.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of Omran\u2019s claims counts as a strike for purposes of \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Coleman v. Tollefson, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 1759, 1763-64, 191 L.Ed.2d 803 (2015). Omran is WARNED that, once he accumulates three strikes, he may not proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b361-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
