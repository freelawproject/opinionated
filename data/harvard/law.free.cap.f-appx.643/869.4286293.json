Hubbard claims he proved the level of mental impairment required for both sets of benefits. After careful review, we find that the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s (ALJ) decision to deny benefits was not supported by substantial evidence and based upon proper legal standards. We therefore reverse and remand to the district court with instructions to remand to the ALJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-13\">We review the ALJ\u2019s decision \u201cto determine if it is supported by substantial evidence and based upon proper legal standards.\u201d <em>Lewis v. Callahan, </em>125 F.3d 1436, 1439 (11th Cir.1997). Both SSDI and SSI benefits require proof of a disability. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(a)(1)(E); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1382(a)(1), (2). A disability is any medically determinable impairment that has lasted or is expected to last for at least twelve continuous months and that makes the claimant unable to engage in substantial gainful activity. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 423(d)(1)(A); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1382c(a)(3)(A). If a claimant meets all the diagnostic criteria for one of the Listings in the SSA\u2019s Listing of Impairments, he qualifies for benefits. <em>See Sullivan v. Zebley, </em>493 U.S. 521, 530, 110 S.Ct. 885, 891, 107 L.Ed.2d 967 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b892-14\">The claimant bears the burden of showing he meets the SSA\u2019s diagnostic criteria. <em>Barron v. Sullivan, </em>924 F.2d 227, 229 (11th Cir.1991). To make this showing, a claimant \u201cmust provide medical reports documenting that [his] conditions meet the specific criteria of the Listings and the duration requirement.\u201d <em>Wilson v. Barn</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number><em>hart, </em>284 F.3d 1219, 1224 (11th Cir.2002) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">Listing 12.05 gives this diagnostic description of \u201cintellectual disability\u201d: \u201csignificantly subaverage general intellectual functioning with deficits in adaptive functioning initially manifested during the developmental period.\u201d 20 C.F.R. Pt. 404, Subpt. P, App. 1 \u00a7 12.05. The SSA has not defined the term \u201cdeficits in adaptive functioning,\u201d but, according to the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition </em>(\u201cDSM-IV\u201d),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> adaptive functioning \u201crefers to how effectively individuals cope with common life demands and how well they meet the standards of personal independence expected of someone in their particular age group, sociocultural background, and community setting.\u201d DSM-IV at 42.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-6\">Once a claimant meets Listing 12.05\u2019s diagnostic threshold, he must also show the Listing\u2019s required level of severity through one of four sets of criteria. As relevant to this case, the criteria include \u201c[a] valid verbal, performance, or full scale IQ of 60 through 70\u201d as well as some other physical or mental impairment that imposes \u201cadditional and significant work-related limitation of function.\u201d 20 C.F.R. Pt. 404, Subpt. P, App. 1, 12.05(C); <em>see also </em>20 C.F.R. Pt. 404, Subpt. P, App. 1, 12.00 (\u201cIf your impairment satisfies the diagnostic description in the introductory paragraph and any one of the four sets of criteria, we will find that your impairment meets the listing.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b893-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-8\">The ALJ found that Hubbard was not disabled within the meaning of Listing 12.05 because he did not have deficits in adaptive functioning. We conclude that this finding was not \u201csupported by substantial evidence and based upon proper legal standards.\u201d <em>Lewis, </em>125 F.3d at 1439.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-11\">Hubbard has a qualifying full scale IQ score of 65 and chronic sinusitis, which the ALJ classified as a \u201csevere impairment.\u201d Absent evidence of sudden trauma, a qualifying IQ score creates a rebuttable presumption that a claimant manifested deficits in adaptive functioning before age 22. <em>See Hodges v. Barnhart, </em>276 F.3d 1265, 1269 (11th Cir.2001). The SSA bears the burden of presenting evidence to rebut this presumption. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b893-12\">The ALJ failed to apply this presumption. Instead, he said that Hubbard \u201cdoes not have a <em>valid </em>verbal, performance, or full scale IQ of 60 through 70\u201d and criticized \u201cthe speculative nature of Dr. Goff\u2019s estimating and approximating [Hubbard\u2019s] IQ.\u201d We agree with the district court that this \u201cobservation simply is not supported by the record.\u201d Dr. Goff determined Hubbard\u2019s IQ score after conducting intelligence testing and there are no conflicting scores in the record. The ALJ erred by disregarding Hubbard\u2019s score, which should have triggered the <em>Hodges </em>presumption. <em>See </em>276 F.3d at 1269.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-13\">The ALJ also erred in giving limited weight to Dr. Goffs assessment because of another district court\u2019s criticism of Dr. Goffs findings in a separate case from over a decade ago. In <em>King v. Apfel, </em>No. CIV.A. 99-0132-RV-M, 2000 WL 284217 (S.D.Ala. Feb. 29, 2000) (unpublished), a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>district court found that \u201ceverything else in the record is counter to the extreme findings of [Dr.] Goff.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *2. On this basis, the ALJ found \u201ca history of questionable veracity to [Dr. Goffs] opinions.\u201d We agree with the district court that the statements in <em>King </em>\u201camount to nothing more than the court\u2019s agreement with the ALJ\u2019s decision to reject Dr. Goffs findings <em>in that case.\u201d </em>As the district court explained in this case, \u201c[t]he rejection of Dr. Goffs opinion in a single case that was decided fifteen years ago cannot reasonably form the basis for rejecting, or even affording extra scrutiny to, his opinions in this case.\u201d While an ALJ is certainly free to give less weight to an expert opinion that \u201cwas not bolstered by the evidence,\u201d <em>Lewis, </em>125 F.3d at 1440, he must do so on the basis of the record before him.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">A valid IQ score is not conclusive evidence that a claimant has deficits in adaptive functioning if the \u201cscore is inconsistent with other evidence in the record on the claimant\u2019s daily activities and behavior.\u201d <em>Lowery v. Sullivan, </em>979 F.2d 835, 837 (11th Cir.1992). The ALJ invoked this principle to further discount Hubbard\u2019s IQ score. However, the ALJ relied on conclusions about Hubbard\u2019s work and school history that were not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-6\">First, the ALJ found that Hubbard\u2019s work history suggested \u201chis, ability to adapt to [] various work environments, handle work stress, follow instructions, and interact with co-workers and supervision.\u201d In fact, Hubbard performed one type of job for fourteen years \u2014 \u201cshoveling] dirt\u201d with an oil drill. According to Hubbard\u2019s testimony, while he could have still performed this job when it ended in 2006, he could no longer do so by the time of his 2012 SSA hearing. As the district court noted, the ALJ incorrectly concluded from this testimony that Hubbard \u201ccould <em>still </em>perform his former job\u201d at the time of the hearing. The record does not support the ALJ\u2019s conclusions about Hubbard\u2019s work history.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-8\">The ALJ also relied on Hubbard\u2019s educational record in finding a lack of adaptive deficits. According to the ALJ, even though Hubbard had \u201ca history of special education, he was able to receive a certification of completion of the twelfth grade.\u201d In addition, the ALJ said Dr. Goffs testing indicated a mid-fourth grade reading, spelling, and math level, \u201cwhich the vocational expert testified would allow the claimant to perform the jobs indicated.\u201d However, Dr. Goff noted that Hubbard indicated that he had to repeat seventh grade and was in special education classes throughout his entire educational career. Dr. Goff also noted that Hubbard \u201cmay have received a certificate of attendance,\u201d not completion. Furthermore, Dr. Goff\u2019s testing actually resulted in \u201cword reading and spelling skills at the ending second grade level,\u201d which \u201creflects] functional illiteracy.\u201d The ALJ\u2019s misstatement of Hubbard\u2019s academic abilities, which misstatement was also identified by the district court, is significant because the vocational expert made job recommendations for a person at the mid-fourth grade level, not the second grade level. Hubbard\u2019s school record does not support the ALJ\u2019s conclusions about his academic abilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-9\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-10\">Despite identifying multiple \u201ccareless\u201d errors in the ALJ\u2019s opinion, the district court relied on Hubbard\u2019s work history, \u201calong with his ability to perform basic personal tasks like driving, paying bills, and performing self-care functions,\u201d to affirm the ALJ\u2019s decision. Like the ALJ, the district court failed to acknowledge the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>rebuttable presumption of deficits in adaptive functioning raised by Hubbard\u2019s low IQ score. And, in relying on evidence of Hubbard\u2019s ability \u201cto perform basic personal tasks,\u201d the district court affirmed based on its own post hoc rationale. However, we decline to affirm using reasoning that \u201cmight have supported the ALJ\u2019s conclusion\u201d but was not offered by the ALJ himself. <em>See Owens v. Heckler, </em>748 F.2d 1511, 1516 (11th Cir.1984) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">Beyond that, the district court\u2019s conclusions about Hubbard\u2019s daily activities are not supported by the record. Although Hubbard testified to driving, he has never had a license. And although the district court found that Hubbard pays his own bills, the record reflects that he does not manage his own bank account, cannot use a checkbook, and that his mother budgeted his money for him when he was working. As for self-care functions, Hubbard\u2019s testimony and questionnaire responses reflect that he does not prepare his own meals, does not do any housework, cannot read or complete job applications on his own, and has never lived alone. Hubbard\u2019s activities are consistent with a finding of deficits in adaptive functioning and do not support the district court\u2019s contrary conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-7\">On this record, we reverse and remand to the district court with instructions to remand to the ALJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-8\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b893-9\">.
