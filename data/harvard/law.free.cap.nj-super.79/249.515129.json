A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"Ak2\">In this workmen\u2019s compensation case Mrs. McAllister, widow of Charles McAllister and mother of his three dependent children, appeals from that portion of the judgment of the County Court which determined that the amount of compensation for his death was governed by the statute which existed at the time of the accident, and not by the statute, which fixed a higher rate, in force when he died. The Board of Education of the Town of Kearny (Kearny) cross-appeals, claiming that the death was not work-connected. After the first argument in this case, we withheld decision pending the determination of <em>Schiffres v. Kittatinny Lodge, Inc., </em>39 <em>N. J. </em>139 (1963), which appeared to involve sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>stantially similar issues. Upon receipt of the opinion in <em>8 chi fres, we </em>called for reargument in the light thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">The decedent had been employed by Kearny as head custodian of one of its schools for 24 years when, on October 25, 1952, he fell 10 to 14 feet from a ladder to the floor of the boiler room and was seriously injirred. On May 15, 1955 the Division adjudged that he had sustained three fractured ribs, punctured pleura, and contusion, displacement and damage of the heart. The heart damage consisted of right bundle branch block, left ventricle hypertrophy and congestive heart failure. At that time the Division concluded that he was totally and permanently disabled, but it found that 25 % of his disability was due to pre-existing arteriosclerosis and arthritic changes in his elbow. The Division did not say how much of the preexisting disability was due to each of the two conditions separately, but it did find as a fact that neither condition was aggravated or affected by the accident. The Division consequently awarded him 75% of total permanent.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">Prior to the accident McAllister had worked steadily. After the accident he never worked again. He was treated by his family doctor, Dr. Kook, from the date of the accident until his death. Dr. Kook examined him periodically, the last time being September 18, 1957. McAllister died October 12, 1957. Dr. Kook testified that his diagnosis of severe myocardial damage with right bundle branch block, left ventricular hypertrophy, and congestive heart failure remained constant through his last examination; although he had not taken electrocardiograms after the award of the Division on May 15, 1955, he could tell from the symptomology that the condition was getting worse, and he anticipated the occurrence of Mc-Allister\u2019s death at any time.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">On October 12, 1957, almost exactly five years after the fall from the ladder, McAllister received a telephone call, about 1 a. m., that Mrs. McAllister was in a tavern with another man. He went to the tavern where he found his wife and the other man; there was a scene; he collapsed in the tavern about 1:45 a. m. and died a few minutes later.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>Kearny\u2019s brief states its position as follows: the injury sustained as a result of the 1952 fall was essentially healed; the condition of arteriosclerotic heart disease which preexisted the 1952 fall got progressively worse; the \u201ctraumatic emotional experience,\u201d superimposed upon the arteriosclerosis, killed him; and petitioner is therefore not entitled to recover. <em>Schiffres v. Kittatinny Lodge, Inc., supra. </em>Kearny appears to concede, as it must under <em>Hagerman v. Lewis lumber Co., </em>13 <em>N. J. </em>315 (1953), that Mrs. McAllister is entitled to an award if the heart injury caused by the 1952 accident had not healed, and the \u201ctraumatic emotional experience,\u201d superimposed upon that injury, caused the death.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">The Division and the County Court found that the 1952 heart injury had not healed; that, on the contrary, it had grown progressively worse, and that the \u201ctraumatic emotional experience\u201d was merely the trigger that killed him. We have examined the evidence in the manner required by <em>Russo v. United States Trucking Corp., </em>26 <em>N. J. </em>430 (1958), and have come to the same conclusion. It seems to us that the ease falls wdtliin <em>Hagerman v. Lewis Lumber Co., supra, </em>and not wdthin <em>Schiffres v. Kittatinny Lodge, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">In addition to Dr. Kook, petitioner called Dr. Saul Lieb. He had examined McAllister prior to the 1955 hearing in the Division. On the basis of that examination and a hypothetical question, Dr. Lieb attributed McAllister\u2019s death to the 1952 heart injury. He said McAllister\u2019s \u201ccondition deteriorated progressively, as evidenced by the observations of Dr. Kook, and his death * * * in my opinion represent fed] the end result of that cardiovascular deterioration.\u201d In his opinion the underlying arteriosclerosis had little to do with the end result, even granting that (because McAllister was five years older) it probably had advanced somewhat beyond what it was in 1952.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">Kearny attacks the validity and the competence of Dr. Lieb\u2019s opinion on the ground that the hypothetical question propounded to him failed to include the fact that Exhibit P-4, offered by petitioner to prove the fact of death, gave the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>cause of death, as \u201cArteriosclerotic Heart Dis.\u201d There is no substance in this attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">To begin with, even if Exhibit P-4 were <em>prima facie </em>evidence that the death was due to arteriosclerosis, it would not be conclusive upon petitioner, or bar her from proving that the death was due to other causes. <em>A fortiori </em>where, as here, there is proof that the death was due to other causes, the cause stated in the death certificate did not have to be included in the hypothetical question posed by petitioner to Dr. Lieb. <em>Peer v. Newark, </em>71 <em>N. J. Super. </em>12, 21 <em>(App. Div. </em>1961), certification denied 36 <em>N. J. </em>300 (1962); <em>Daggett v. North Jersey St. Ry. Co., </em>75 <em>N. J. L. </em>630, 637 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1907).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">Furthermore, Exhibit P-4 does not purport to be a copy of the entire original death certificate. It is a paper, signed by Rose L. Gibb, Registrar of Vital Statistics in Kearny, which says: \u201cThis is to- Certify that the following is correctly copied from a record of Death in my office,\u201d followed by decedent\u2019s name, place and date of death, marital condition, occupation, and the above quoted cause of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">We need not pause to determine whether any of the contents of such an abbreviation of a death certificate may \u201cbe received as <em>prima facie </em>evidence of the facts therein stated,\u201d under <em>N. J. S. </em>2A:82-12, <em>N. J. S. A. </em>It is sufficient for present purposes to say it was not competent evidence of the cause of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\"><em>B. S. </em>26:6-8, <em>N. J. S. A. </em>provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-8\">\u201cIn the execution of a death certificate, the personal particulars shall be obtained from the person best qualified to supply them. The death and last sickness particulars shall be supplied by the attending physician, or if there be no attending physician, by the county physician, or coroner. * * * Each informant shall certify to the particulars supplied by him by signing his name below the list of items furnished.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b272-10\">\u201c[I]t is only the death certificate made in accordance with law that is <em>prima facie </em>evidence of the facts stated.\u201d <em>Aitken </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number><em>v. John Hancock Mutual Life Ins. Co., </em>124 <em>N. J. L. </em>58 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1940); <em>Magnuson v. Peterson, Inc., </em>132 <em>N. J. L. </em>243, 247 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1944). See also <em>Talbott v. Wooster, </em>61 <em>N. J. Super. 221 (Law Div. </em>1960). Exhibit P-4 contained no indication of the source of the information as to the cause of death, or that the original certificate had been signed by any of the persons mentioned in <em>It. S. </em>26 :6-8, <em>N. J. S. A. </em>Therefore it was not <em>prima facie </em>evidence of the cause of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">Dr. Applebaum, who had also examined McAllister prior to the 1955 hearing in the Division, testified that in his opinion the death was due to the progress of the arteriosclerosis. However, the judge of compensation, after hearing and seeing the witnesses, accepted the testimony of petitioner\u2019s medical witnesses in preference to that of Dr. Applebaum, and the County Court did likewise. We perceive no reason to differ. We hold, therefore, that petitioner and her children are entitled to an award.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">That brings us to the question whether the award should be based on <em>L. </em>1956, <em>c. </em>141, \u00a7 3, <em>N. J. S. A. </em>34:15-13 in effect at the time of McAllister\u2019s death (as the judge of compensation held) or on the lesser rate fixed by the statute in force at the time of the accident (as the County Court held).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">The parties agree that the only two New Jersey cases which have decided this question are <em>Ermola v. Hudson Paint &amp; Varnish Co., </em>70 <em>N. J. Super. </em>76 <em>(Essex Cty. Ct. </em>1961), which held that the statute in force on the date of the injury governs, and <em>Goldmann v. Johanna Farms, Inc., </em>61 <em>N. J. Super. </em>138 <em>(Mercer Cty. Ct. </em>1960), which concluded that it is the statute in force at the date of death which governs. We shall occasionally refer to these holdings as the <em>Ermola </em>rule and the <em>Goldmann </em>rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">We must first determine whether <em>L. </em>1956, <em>c. </em>141, itself indicates that the Legislature intended it to apply only to accidents happening after its enactment. <em>Cf. Chambers v. Toohey, </em>187 A. 49, 14 <em>N. J. Misc. </em>780 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1936).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>Kearny argues that a statute must be construed prospectively unless it expressly provides otherwise, and, since this statute did not provide that it was to cover deaths due to pre-existing injuries, it must be held that it did not. Petitioner, on the other hand, argues that an earlier amendment of this statute, <em>L. </em>1945, c. 74, provided that it was to \u201capply to any accident or compensable occupational disease occurring on or after January first, one thousand nine hundred and forty-six\u201d; no such language was used in the later amendments made by <em>L. </em>1953, c. 159, and said <em>L. </em>1956, <em>c. </em>141; therefore it must be concluded that the Legislature intended the 1953 and 1956 amendments to cover past as well as future accidents. In 1952 we held that the increased funeral allowance provided for by <em>L. </em>1945, c. 74, could not be given to the widow of a worker who, though he died after January 1, 1946, was injured prior to that date. <em>Atamanik v. Real Estate Management, Inc., 21 N. J. Super. </em>357 <em>(App. Div. </em>1952). It may be that the limitation to future accidents expressed in <em>L. </em>1945, c. 74, was dropped in the later amendments because the Legislature intended to avoid the holding in <em>Atamanih.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">It must be noted that <em>L. </em>1956, c. 141, contained provisions of the type which the courts had held, prior to 1956, could not be applied to past accidents. Eor example, it increased the temporary and permanent disability benefits, and the scheduled payment for the loss of vision of an eye. On the other hand, the act contained provisions which obviously were intended to apply to previous accidents, as, for example, the provision enlarging the time for filing answers to claim petitions. Therefore, our view is that the Legislature intended that the statute apply to past as well as future accidents wherever legally possible.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">As to the new death benefits fixed by <em>L. </em>1956, c. 141, the statement annexed to the bill declared its purpose to be as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>\u201cRecognizing the fact that the compensation benefit rates now payable are out of proportion to meet the present cost of living both temporary and permanent benefits are increased accordingly by this bill.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-5\">In the case of a widow who remarries prior to the expiration of the period of dependency, the present law prescribes that she shall forfeit the entire balance of benefits, whereas under this bill she will be entitled to receive the balance of benefits or $1,000.00, whichever is tlie lesser.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-6\">The increase in funeral allowance to $400.00 is to meet the present cost of that service.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-7\">The increase in the schedule of weeks from 300 to 350 payable under section 34:15-13 gives further aid to dependents as named therein. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">In the light of that .statement, and bearing in mind that the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act must always be liberally construed in favor of the employee and his dependents, we hold that it was the intention of the Legislature to increase the benefits to dependents of a worker who died after the enactment of the statute, even if he died as a result of an injury sustained in an accident which happened before the enactment of the statute. <em>Cf. Bower v. Metal Compounds Corp., </em>121 <em>N. J. L. </em>421, 423 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1938), affirmed o. b. 122 <em>N. J. L. </em>380 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1939); <em>Chambers v. Toohey, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b275-9\">The question then is, is there any constitutional or other legal barrier to applying the statute in this fashion? We think not.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-10\">58 <em>Am. Jur., Worlcmen\u2019s Compensation, </em>\u00a7 301, <em>p. </em>790, says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-11\">\u201cThe amount of compensation which may be awarded to an injured employee is governed, ordinarily, by the law in force at the time of the injury. * * * The claims of relatives, dependents, or beneficiaries of the estate of a deceased employee, in so far as they are predicated upon the survival of the rights of the employee, are also governed, ordinarily, by the law in force at the time of the injury. But where the statute vests in the dependents or survivors of a deceased employee a new and independent right to compensation on account of his death, the amount recoverable is governed, ordinarily, by the law in force at the time of death.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b275-12\">See also 58 <em>Am. Jur. </em>\u00a7 73, <em>p. </em>627.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>Our Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act does vest in the dependents \u201ca new and independent right to compensation\u201d on account of the employee\u2019s death. <em>Lusczy v. Seaboard By Products Co., </em>101 <em>N. J. L. </em>170, 173 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1925); <em>Echert v. New Jersey State Highway Department, </em>1 <em>N. J. </em>474, 480 (1949); <em>Kozielec v.

Joma Plumbing &amp; Heating Co., </em>38 <em>N. J. </em>326, 335 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">Although there is a split of authority on the subject in other jurisdictions (see 9 <em>Schneider, Worhmen\u2019s Compensation, </em>\u00a7 1937, <em>p. </em>74 (1950), and 1959 <em>Cumulative Supplement, vol. </em>3, <em>pp. </em>367-369; 99 <em>G. J. S. Worhmen\u2019s Compensation </em>\u00a7 31c, <em>pp. </em>138-140) we consider the above-quoted statement from <em>American Jurisprudence </em>to be sound. It states the rule followed in <em>Goldmann v. Johanna Farms, Inc:, supra. </em>Good explanations of the rationale of this rule may be found in <em>State ex rel. Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Corp. v. Dickerson et al., </em>160 <em>Ohio St. </em>223, 115 <em>N. H. 2d </em>833 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1953); <em>Hirsch v. Hirsch Bros., </em>97 <em>N. H. </em>480, 92 <em>A. 2d </em>402 <em>(Sup.

App. </em>1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">Kearny naturally relies upon <em>Ermola </em>and the cases therein cited. The basis of the holding in <em>Ermola </em>is that, in New Jersey, workmen\u2019s compensation is elective and therefore contractual; the employer may withdraw from the contract at any time upon 60 days\u2019 notice <em>(N. J. S. A. </em>34:15-13), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>but he can not escape liability to pay compensation for injuries already sustained or for death resulting therefrom; therefore, it would be an unconstitutional impairment of the contract between the employer and the employee to increase the rate of compensation for resulting death after the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">Although this argument has a certain logic and a beguiling symmetry, it seems to us that it does not withstand analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">Although the rights and liabilities of employer and employee under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act have been called \u201ccontractual in nature\u201d <em>(Miller v. National Chair Co., </em>127 <em>N. J. L. </em>414, 417 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1941), affirmed o. b. 129 <em>N. J. L. </em>98 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1942), and \u201ca definite statutory status or relationship which in essence is contractual,\u201d <em>New Amsterdam Casualty Co. v. Popovich, </em>18 <em>N. J. </em>218, 226 (1955), they are not truly contractual. <em>Biglioli v. Durotest Corp., </em>26 <em>N. J. </em>33, 40 (1958); <em>Gotkin v. Weinberg, </em>2 <em>N. J. </em>305 (1949). The courts have used the term \u201ccontract\u201d in workmen\u2019s compensation eases much as they have used that term when speaking of marriage \u201ccontracts.\u201d In employment, like in marriage, the parties must agree to enter the relationship, but once they do the law dictates to them their rights and liabilities. And, as in marriage\u2014within legal limitations haying nothing to do with the impairment of contract\u2014the law may change those rights and liabilities, not only at any time during the relationship but sometimes even after it has been terminated, as, for example, after the employee has stopped working for the employer because of an injury. <em>Feinsod v. L. &amp; F. Construction Co., </em>4 <em>A. 2d </em>692, 17 <em>N. J. Misc. </em>65 <em>(C. P. </em>1939), affirmed <em>sub nom. Savitt v. L. &amp; F. Construction Co., </em>123 <em>N. J. L. </em>149 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1939), affirmed, 124 <em>N. J. L. </em>173 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1940); <em>J. W. Ferguson Co. v. Seaman, </em>119 <em>N. J. L. </em>575 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1938).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">In <em>Biglioli, supra, </em>the worker was last exposed to beryllium before the statute made berylliosis compensable, but the worker did not become ill with berylliosis until after the statute was enacted. The court held he was entitled to com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>pensation. It is true that Biglioli had continued to work for Durotest until after the statute was adopted, but we are of the opinion that the result would have been the same even if that had not been the fact. So here, the accident caused injury to McAllister for which he was compensated in his lifetime. His death, in 1957, was a new and separate injury to his dependents and, as such, it was governed by <em>L. </em>1956, c. 141.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">The hollowness of the ring of \u201ccontract\u201d becomes obvious when we tap it against the fact that the Compensation Act became binding upon employers and employees whose employment contracts antedated adoption of the act, in spite of the express terms of such contracts, and not by the action of the parties but by their inaction, <em>Troth v. Millville Bottle Works, </em>89 <em>N. J. L. </em>219 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1916); <em>Sexton v. Newark Dist. Telegraph Co., </em>84 <em>N. J. L. </em>85 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1913), affirmed o. b. 86 <em>N. J. L. </em>701 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1914); <em>Gotkin v. Weinberg, supra; </em>that the act is binding upon nonresident employers, even though the employee is a nonresident, was hired in a foreign state, the employer was never present in this State, and the workmen\u2019s compensation laws of the state of hiring provide different rights and coverage, <em>Boyle v. G. &amp; K. Trucking Co., </em>37 <em>N. J. </em>104 (1962); <em>cf. Cramer v. State Concrete Corp., </em>39 <em>N. J. </em>507 (1963); and, at least until an injury, the parties are bound by even radical and substantive changes in the act made after the entry into the employment contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">The net result of all this is that the workmen\u2019s compensation \u201ccontract\u201d includes everything that the Legislature and the courts say it shall include, whether added before or after the injury. It is therefore arguing in a circle to seek what the \u201ccontract\u201d includes and whether it has been impaired. The analogy to contract is often a handy aid for the analysis of a specific problem, just as a paper tube may sometimes be an aid to hearing, but \u201ccontract\u201d no more accurately describes the rights and duties of an employer and an employee under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act than a paper tube corrects deafness.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>Finally, to such a \u201ccontract\u201d the words of Chief Justice Hughes, uttered in <em>Home Building &amp; Loan Association v. Blaisdell, </em>290 <em>U. S. </em>398, 428, 438, 54 <em>S. Ct. </em>231, 236, 240, 78 <em>L. Ed. </em>413 (1934), are especially applicable. In upholding the Minnesota mortgage moratorium law, he said \u201cthe prohibition [against impairment of the obligations of contract] is not an absolute one and is not to be read with literal exactness like a mathematical formula. * * * The question is not whether the legislative action affects contracts incidentally, or directly or indirectly, but whether the legislation is addressed to a legitimate end and the measures taken are reasonable and appropriate to that end.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">Of course, no statute may take away vested rights. <em>Pennsylvania Greyhound Lines, Inc. v. Rosenthal, </em>14 <em>N. J. </em>372, 384 (1954). We think that is the true test of the validity of retroactive workmen\u2019s compensation statutes and not whether they impair an imaginary \u201ccontract.\u201d See <em>Baur v. Common Pleas of Essex, </em>88 <em>N. J. L. </em>128 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1915); <em>Erie Railroad Co. v. Callaway, </em>91 <em>N. J. L. </em>32 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1917); <em>Hansen v. Brann &amp; Stewart Co., </em>90 <em>N. J. L. </em>444 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1917); <em>Klevinsky v. Lafferty, </em>122 <em>N. J. L. </em>130 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1939); <em>Gianforte v. Crucible Steel Co. of America, </em>25 <em>N. J. Super. </em>183 <em>(Cty. Ct. </em>1953) ; <em>Atamanik v. Real Estate Management, Inc., supra. </em>(The citation of some of the older of these cases is not to be taken as an expression that we think they would be decided in the same fashion today.)</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">In short, we hold that no contract was impaired, and that Kearny did not have a vested right to pay compensation to McAllister\u2019s dependents, in the event of his death, only upon the basis of the statute in force when McAllister was injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">It has been said that most cases which follow the <em>Ermola </em>rule have arisen in states which have an elective system of workmen\u2019s compensation, while the <em>Goldmann </em>rule has been followed in states in which workmen\u2019s compensation is compulsory. <em>Schneider, Workmen\u2019s Compensation, </em>1959 <em>Cumulative Supplement, vol. </em>3, <em>supra, </em>at <em>p. </em>367. See also <em>Travelers </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number><em>Ins. Co. v. Toner, </em>89 U. <em>S. App. D. C. </em>77, 190 <em>F. 2d </em>30 <em>(D. C. Cir. </em>1951), <em>cert. </em>denied 342 <em>U. S. </em>826, 72 <em>S. Ct. </em>48, 96 <em>L. Ed. </em>624 (1951); <em>Penn Jersey Welding Co. v. Lowe, </em>183 <em>F. 2d </em>936 (3 <em>Cir. </em>1950). Based upon this, it may be suggested that all states having elective compensation systems are compelled by the Federal Constitution, or their own, to follow the <em>Ermola </em>rule. Our examination of the cases satisfies us that there is no merit in this suggestion.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">The New Hampshire cases of <em>Cote v. Bachelder-Worcester Co., </em>85 <em>N. H. </em>444, 160 <em>A. </em>101, 82 <em>A. L. R. </em>1239 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1932), and <em>Hirsch v. Hirsch Bros., </em>97 <em>N. H. </em>480, 92 <em>A. 2d </em>402, 405 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1952), afford an interesting demonstration of the lack of merit in such an analysis. Hew Hampshire is apparently an elective state. In <em>Gote </em>the Hew Hampshire Supreme Court followed the <em>Ermola </em>rule. In <em>Hirsch </em>the court pointed out that when <em>Gote </em>was decided the statute provided that \u201ccompensation due in case of death was payable to the fiegal representative [of a decedent] for the benefit of [his] dependents\u2019,\u201d but that thereafter the statute was changed to read \u201c \u2018If death results from the injury, the employer shall pay to, or for the dependent or dependents of the deceased employee * * * a weekly compensation * * and hence <em>Gote </em>was no longer the law. The court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-5\">\u201cThe section indicates a legislative purpose to create in a dependent widow or child \u2018a separate right of action for the loss resulting.\u2019 * * * It follows that the rights of the dependents are to be determined according to the law in force at the time the rights arose, namely, upon the death of the employee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-6\">The death of Carl Hirsch occurred on July 6, 1951. Effective on the preceding July 1, the maximum amount payable on account of death was increased from $7,500 to $9,000. Laws 1951, c. 74. The decree awarded compensation at the rate of $25 per week, to be paid over a period of 300 weeks. Thus a maximum of $7,500 was provided. * * * The amendment of 1951, supra, which the Court ruled did not apply, retained the weekly maximum of $30, but increased the total maximum from $7,500 to $9,000. The decree should have been entered in accordance with the last amendment, and must be vacated.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b281-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>See also <em>Rosell v. State Industrial Accident Commission, </em>164 <em>Or. </em>173, 95 <em>P. 2d </em>726 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1939). On the other hand, in Massachusetts the act is compulsory, yet Massachusetts holds that an increase in dependency death benefits does not apply to deaths due to injuries sustained before the passage of the statute. <em>Beausoleil\u2019s </em>Case, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">Even under a compulsory workmen\u2019s, compensation act, the employer and employee may acquire vested rights of which they may not be deprived by retroactive legislation. If the extent of the obligation of the employer for resulting death became fixed at the time of the injury or accident, the employer could not be deprived of the right to stand upon that limitation, even under a compulsory system, and even though there was no \u201ccontract\u201d to be protected against impairment. Therefore, when the courts in states in which the act is compulsory apply the <em>Goldmann </em>rule, they do so for the reason that the rights and liabilities of the employer to the dependents upon death do not become completely fixed at the time of the injury or accident, even though those who constitute the class from which the dependents will be chosen in the event of death may be closed at the time of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">Eor the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the County Court is modified to provide for the payment of compensation as fixed by the Division. In all other respects, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
