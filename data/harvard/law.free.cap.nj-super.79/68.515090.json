J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"AFF\">This is a mechanic\u2019s lien action in which defendants Frank and Dollie Summerfield, husband and wife, appeal from a judgment entered in the Union County District Court in the sum of $548.40 plus costs in favor of the plaintiff and specially against lands and building owned by defendants situate at 330 Tower Street, Union, Hew Jersey. The action was instituted against the Summerfields by the plaintiff materialman, Apex Roofing Supply Co., to recover a special judgment, as well as against Modern Home Industries, Inc., the building contractor, for general judgment. The defendant builder filed no answer, and judgment by default was entered against it. It is not a party to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-8\">The defendants Summerfield owned the building and property subject to the judgment as tenants by the entirety. Modern Home Industries, Inc. was engaged by the Summer-fields to do repair work on the property. Ho contract evidencing this understanding was filed under <em>N. J. 8. </em>2A:44-75.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-9\">On June 9, 1961 plaintiff furnished the contractor with materials for the job at a price of $190.50. Delivery of $263.50 worth of goods was made on June 12, 1961 at \u201caround\u201d 10:00 A. M. At 10:23 A. m. on June 12 a mechanic\u2019s notice of intention, filed by plaintiff pursuant to <em>N. J. 8. </em>2A:44-71, was stamped \u201cfiled\u201d in the Union County Clerk\u2019s Office. Other materials sold for $285.00 were delivered to the contractor by plaintiff on June 12, 1961, after 10:23 A. m. (there were other deliveries on subsequent dates not here involved).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-10\">Pursuant to <em>N. J. 8. </em>2A :44U91, plaintiff filed a lien claim within four months after the date of delivery of the last <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>materials furnished. That claim, and the summons and complaint ,in the instant action, which latter were filed on October 16, 1961, named \u201cJervis Miller, doing business as Modern Home Industries,\u201d as the builder. (The mechanic\u2019s notice of intention simply designated \u201cModern Home Industries.\u201d) The answer filed by defendants Summerfield on November 15, 1961 specifically set forth that the builder with whom they dealt was not Jervis Miller, but rather Modern Home Industries, Inc., a corporation. In March 1962 plaintiff sought, and was granted, over objection of the Summerfields, leave to amend the notice of intention, the lien claim, and the summons and complaint to show the corporation as the builder or defendant in place of the individual, Miller.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">At the trial plaintiff voluntarily abandoned its claim as to the June 9 delivery, that concededly having been made before the filing of the notice of intention, and thereby not being entitled to a lien under <em>N. J. 8. </em>2A:4L-71. The defendants urged that plaintiff\u2019s entire claim was invalid on the ground that the statutory requirement for giving them notice of the filing of the notice of intention was not met in that there was a mailing of only a single notice to both defendants jointly; and that amendment of the lien claim and summons and complaint more than four months after the last deliveries by plaintiff was improper. Defendants claimed also that, in any event, the $263.50 item delivered on June 12 was not covered by a lien since the delivery was prior to the actual time of filing of the notice of intention. The trial court rejected all of the defendants\u2019 contentions, and this appeal followed. However, plaintiff has now agreed the $263.50 item was in fact delivered before the filing of the notice of intention and has abandoned its claim to that much of the judgment below.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\"><em>N. J. 8. </em>2A:44-71 provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-8\">\u201c[n lotice, in writing, of the filing of any such notice of intention shall he given within 5 days of such filing to the owner of the premises, of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>the land described therein, personally or by registered mail, to the last known address, and unless such notice to the said owner be so given, the filing of the said notice of intention shall have \u00f1o force or effect.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">So far as we can tell from the certified \u201cStatement of Facts\u201d and \u201cOpinion\u201d of the trial court, which are not too clear in this regard, a single registered letter, return receipt requested, was mailed to the Summerfields, addressed to Frank and Dollie M. Summerfield (or to Frank Summerfield and Dollie M. Summerfield), 330 Tower St., Union, N. J. The letter contained notice of the filing of the mechanic\u2019s notice of intention and it was mailed within five days of the filing of the said notice. When this letter arrived at the Summerfield home, the return receipt, which was placed in evidence, was signed by a Mrs. Moffitt, purportedly, according to the notation on the receipt, for Frank Summerfield. Mrs. Moffitt resided with the Summerfields and was Mrs. Summer-field\u2019s mother. Defendants contend that Mr. and Mrs. Summerfield were each entitled to separate notice under the act. There is no reported ease in the context of our mechanic\u2019s lien law directly in point. <em>Apex Roofing Supply Co. v. Howell, </em>59 <em>N. J. Super. </em>462 <em>(App. Div. </em>1960), is not here authoritative. In that case a purported \u201cnotice\u201d was sent to \u201cMr. &amp; Mrs. Benjamin Howell,\u201d the property being owned by Benjamin Howell and his sister, Esther Howell, and the letter was received by Benjamin Howell. This court held that the letter, being misleadingly phrased in the nature of a congratulatory message rather than calculated to warn persons that their property was being encumbered, did not constitute the character of notice required by the statute. We also there noted that the sister, Esther Howell, was not an addressee of the letter and that there was no proof that the letter ever came to her attention. (59 <em>N. J. Super., </em>at <em>p. </em>470).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">Defendants rely also on <em>Henry C. McCandless, Inc. v. Schaffer, </em>103 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>170 <em>(Ch. </em>1928) and <em>Frantz Equipment Co. v. Anderson, </em>37 <em>N. J. </em>420 (1962). The <em>Mc-Candless </em>case involved the question whether a property owner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>had received due notice of right of redemption after an <em>in rem </em>tax foreclosure sale of his property had taken place. The court held that a letter addressed to the owner and his wife was insufficient notice to the owner himself where the record showed that the husband-owner was having marital difficulties, often living away from home, and claimed never to have received the letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">In the <em>Frantz </em>case, <em>supra, </em>the Supreme Court held that notice of foreclosure sale mailed to conditional vendees was \u201cmisdirected\u201d if addressed jointly to two or more buyers residing at the same address. However, the court indicated that a conditional vendor would be in \u201cpractical compliance\u201d with the statute by showing that \u201ceach of [the vendees] had received the notice or had acquired * * * actual notice of the existence and contents thereof from the co-addressees * * (37 <em>N. J., </em>at <em>p. </em>429). The principles thus expressed appear to us to be germane and applicable by analogy to the situation in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">It seems to us reasonably inferable that one spouse would inform the other, both being joint tenants of real property where they reside together, of so important a matter as the arrival of a notice of lien addressed to both of them. However, as indicated <em>infra, </em>we do not propose to decide this factual issue on the present appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">Defendants call our attention to <em>Bukowitz v. Maryland Lumber Company, </em>210 <em>Md. </em>148, 122 <em>A. 2d </em>486 <em>(Ct. App. </em>1956), and <em>Webber Lumber &amp; Supply Co. v. Erickson, </em>216 <em>Mass. </em>81, 102 <em>N. E. </em>940 <em>(Sup. Jud. Ct. </em>1913). Neither of these cases helps defendants. In the Maryland case, a statute required that notice in writing be served on a married woman before a lien could attach upon her real property. The evidence showed that a registered letter containing a mechanic\u2019s notice sent to the party affected, a married woman, was returned unopened, marked refused. A few days later her husband, a tenant by the entirety, was served with a copy of the letter personally. Thus, no notice in writing was ever served on the wife, as particularly required by statute. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>the Massachusetts case, the parties were owners as tenants in common and not by the entirety. The plaintiff tried to show an agency relation between the husband, who was given notice, and the wife, who was not. The court rejected the argument, pointing to the completely separate interests of tenants in common.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\"> We have concluded that since the legal problem here involved was novel when the case was tried, plaintiff should have an opportunity to sustain the burden of showing, in line with the <em>Frantz </em>decision, <em>supra, </em>that both Summerfields had received the notice or had acquired actual knowledge of the existence and contents thereof. There will be a remand for such purpose only. If notice is brought home to only one of the parties, the lien will attach only to his or her interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">Defendants\u2019 second ground of appeal concerns the amending of the lien claim and summons and complaint more than four months after the supplies were delivered. In effect, they say that such amendment amounted to a substitution of a new party, a corporation, after the running of the four-month period beyond which the statute no longer permits filing of the lien claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">As indicated above, the notice of intention specified the name of the builder to be \u201cModern Home Industries\u201d and did not indicate whether the entity was an individual, a partnership, or a corporation. The lien claim and complaint and summons referred to the contractor as \u201cJervis Miller, trading as Modern Home Industries.\u201d As stated, Modern Home Industries, Inc. was a Few Jersey corporation. In allowing amendment of the mechanic\u2019s notice, the lien claim and the summons and complaint, the court described the original misdescription as a \u201charmless technical error,\u201d going only to a mistake in denominating a party actually joined as such in the action, noting further that the defendant owners were not prejudiced thereby since \u201cthe only party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>capable of being aggrieved * * <em>* </em>would be the defendant Modern Home Industries * * <em>* </em>who permitted a default to be entered against it * *</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">We agree with the conclusion of the trial court. If it be conceded <em>arguendo </em>that these defendants have standing to object to the amendment of the lien claim, the contention they advance is still without merit. <em>N. J. S. </em>2A:44-94 authorizes the court to permit amendment of the lien claim \u201c[a]t any time before final judgment, and either before or after the commencement of action * * The statute expressly permits amendment \u201cin matters of substance as well as form.\u201d A similar provision for amendment of notice of intention is found in <em>N. J. 8. </em>2A:44-73. Both sections have been liberally construed to effect the remedial policy behind the mechanic\u2019s lien statutes. <em>Apex Roofing Supply Co. v. Kersner, </em>53 <em>N. J. Super. </em>1 <em>(App. Div. </em>1958); <em>J. D. Loizeaux Lumber Co. v. Davis, </em>41 <em>N. J. Super. </em>231 <em>(App. Div. </em>1956). As concerns amendment of the summons and complaint, the amendment brought no new entity into the ease, as a matter of substance. There was simply an amendment of a party\u2019s name. See <em>Mears v. Economy Brake Service, Inc., </em>78 <em>N. J. Super. </em>218 <em>(App. Div. </em>1963), certif. denied 40 <em>N.J. </em>216 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-8\">In any event, any error in amending the name of the builder in the notice or the lien claim was not prejudicial to the presently appealing defendants, see <em>Apex Roofing Supply Co. v. Kersner, supra </em>(53 <em>N. J. Super., </em>at <em>p. </em>5). This observation applies <em>a fortiori </em>insofar as the amendment of the summons and complaint is concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-10\"> Finally, defendants, invoking the principle of <em>Friedman v. Stein, </em>4 <em>N. J. </em>34 (1950), argue the lien claim should be invalidated in entirety on the ground it was deliberately false in including items delivered June 9, 1961, the notice not having been filed until June 12, 1961. The rule of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number><em>Friedman </em>applies only where a misstatement is willful. The trial court in effect found that the inclusion of the June 9, 1961 delivery was not willful, noting that plaintiff at the opening of the trial disavowed the item as inadvertently included. There is no proof of intentional misrepresentation in the record, and we sustain the holding of the trial court in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">The matter is remanded to the county district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. We do not retain jurisdiction. Costs to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
