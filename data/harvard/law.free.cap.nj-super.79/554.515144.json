J. S. A. </em>34:15-94 and 95. The matter came on for hearing before a deputy director of workmen\u2019s compensation on January <em>21, </em>1958 and resulted in an advisory report recommending that the petition be dismissed. The then Acting Commissioner concurred in and adopted the report, and thereupon entered an order dismissing the petition. Petitioner\u2019s appeal to the County Court resulted in a reversal. <em>Mayti v. Male, </em>59 <em>N. J. Super. </em>418 <em>(Cty Ct. </em>1960). The present Commissioner of Labor and Industry appealed the resulting judgment admitting petitioner to the benefits of the One Per Cent Fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">At the very outset of the oral argument appellant, as Commissioner and as Trustee of the Fund, stated that he conceded petitioner is entitled to Fund benefits, and that the exceptions set out in <em>subsections </em>(a), (b), (c) and (d) of <em>N. J. S. A. </em>34:15-95 have no application. <em>We </em>have independently come to the same conclusion, as did the county judge. The judgment is therefore affirmed on this ground alone.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
