Because we find merit in one of Dotson\u2019s contentions, we grant rehearing to the extent necessary for the revisions set forth below; otherwise, we deny Dotson\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-16\">In our opinion reported at 817 F.2d 1127 (5th Cir.1987), we rejected Dotson\u2019s contention that a lengthy police report detailing the statement of a government witness to police, admitted below as a prior consistent statement, was inadmissible hearsay not falling within any exception to the hearsay rule. We concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AEJb\">Dotson\u2019s objection that the report constituted \u201chearsay within hearsay\u201d is misplaced. According to the terms of rule 801(d)(1), prior consistent statements are not hearsay; the hearsay-within-hearsay principle contained in rule 805 simply does not apply to prior consistent statements.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1099-18\"><em>Id. </em>at 1133. Upon reconsideration, we find the line of reasoning expressed above to be misplaced, and therefore vacate that portion of our opinion. For the purposes of the hearsay-within-hearsay principle expressed in rule 805, \u201cnon-hearsay\u201d statements under rule 801(d), such as prior consistent statements, should be considered in analyzing a multiple-hearsay statement as the equivalent of a level of the combined statements \u201cthat conforms with an exception to the hearsay rule.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 805; <em>see Southern Stone Co. v. Singer, </em>665 F.2d 698, 703 (Former 5th Cir.1982) (even if one level of double-hearsay statement was not hearsay according to Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(A), second level of hearsay was not excepted from hearsay rule and document was inadmissible). That is, the mere fact that one level of a multiple-level statement qualifies as \u201cnon-hearsay\u201d does not excuse the other levels from rule 805\u2019s mandate that each level satisfy an exception to the hearsay rule for the statement to be admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-19\">For the purposes of our rule 805 analysis, the report contains two levels of hearsay: the report says that Sergeant Anderson said (first level) that Young said that he carried marijuana for Dotson two or three times a week (second level). Even though the second level qualifies as non-hearsay under rule 801(d)(1)(B) (prior consistent statement), the first level remains, and does not qualify under any exception to the hearsay rule. The report was thus inadmissible, and the district court erred in allowing the jury to consider it. We therefore vacate our holding in Part IV of the opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-20\">Having carefully reviewed a second time the evidence supporting Dotson\u2019s conviction on the conspiracy count, we conclude that such evidence is so overwhelm<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1036\">*1036</page-number>ing there is not \u201ca reasonable possibility that the evidence complained of might have contributed to the conviction.\u201d <em>Fahy v. Connecticut, 375 </em>U.S. 85, 86-87, 84 S.Ct. 229, 230, 11 L.Ed.2d 171 (1963). We recognize that the report contained a number of potentially prejudicial statements that were not addressed in Young\u2019s trial testimony, and we recognize the potentially multiplicative effects that might result from the erroneous admission of the report in conjunction with the erroneously admitted evidence that was the product of an unreasonable search and seizure, discussed in Part V of the opinion. On this record, however, we can only consider the erroneously admitted evidence as whispers in a hail storm: the evidence indicating guilt is so strong we can have no reasonable doubt that the report, viewed in conjunction with the evidence from the search of the car, did not contribute to the verdict. <em>See </em>Part V of the opinion (reviewing evidence supporting conspiracy conviction). Therefore, although we agree upon reconsideration that the report constituted hearsay, we find that the district court\u2019s error in admitting the report was in any event harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-4\">We find no merit in the other contentions raised in Dotson\u2019s petition for rehearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-5\">The application for rehearing is GRANTED to the extent necessary for the revision specified above; otherwise the application for rehearing is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
