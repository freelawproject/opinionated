Although the trial judge included both negligence and breach of warranty in his statement of plaintiffs\u2019 theory of the case to the jury, he refused to give plaintiffs\u2019 requested instructions on breach of implied warranty.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A judgment for the defendant, upon a jury verdict of no cause of action, was reversed by the Court of Appeals, which held that the trial court\u2019s failure to charge the jury as requested was reversible error, mandating a new trial. <em>Prentis v Yale Mfg Co, </em>116 Mich App 466; 323 NW2d 444 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b827-4\">We granted leave to appeal and limited our inquiry to the following issue: whether the trial judge\u2019s refusal to instruct the jury on breach of warranty was reversible error in this products liability action against a manufacturer for an alleged defect in the design of a product, where the jury was properly instructed on the theory of negligent design.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b827-7\">The facts of this case are not seriously in dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>pute. In April of 1970, plaintiff John Prentis, who was employed as foreman of the parts department at an automobile dealership, sustained a hip injury in an accident involving the use of a forklift manufactured by defendant Yale Manufacturing Company and sold to plaintiff\u2019s employer in 1952. The forklift was a stand-up or walking type, termed by defendant a \"walkie hi-lo\u201d model, rather than a riding or sit down variety. It was operated by lifting its handle up, much like the handle of a wagon. The forklift was estimated by plaintiff to weigh about two thousand pounds and was powered by a large battery, which had to be recharged every night. The machine was equipped with a hand controlled \"dead-man\u201d switch which normally prevented it from moving if the operator let go of the handle or controls.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-6\">Mr. Prentis, who was sixty-three years old at the time of the accident, had been working at the automobile dealership for two years prior to his injury, and testified that he had occasionally operated the forklift during that period, although he had never been formally instructed as to its operation by his employer. He testified that he was aware of and had previously experienced problems with the machine. After use for five or six hours, the battery charge would run down and the machine would operate erratically. When the battery was low, Mr. Prentis said he would play the handle back and forth to get the machine to start and when he did this the machine was subject to power surges which he said could throw a person off balance if care was not taken. He testified that prior to his accident, the machine had broken through the garage door of the dealership five or six times due to such power surges.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-7\">The accident in which Mr. Prentis was injured occurred late in the day, and he testified that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>was aware at the time that the battery charge on the forklift was running low. After using the machine to assist him in placing an engine inside the cargo area of a delivery van, while the forklift was in tow behind him on a slightly inclined ramp leading from the delivery bay, Mr. Prentis attempted to start the machine by working the handle up and down. When the machine experienced a power surge, he lost his footing and fell to the ground. It appears that plaintiffs injuries were a result of the fall only, as the machine did not hit or run over him, but continued past him and stopped when it ran into a parked car. Mr. Prentis received extensive treatment for multiple fractures of his left hip.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-4\">Plaintiffs filed suit in August of 1972, alleging negligence, failure to warn, and breach of implied warranty, and the case proceeded to trial in August of 1976. Judgment of no cause of action based upon a jury verdict in favor of the defendant was entered on September 17, 1976, and was reversed by the Court of Appeals in an unpublished opinion dated July 7, 1978. The reversal was based upon a finding that the trial court abused its discretion when it prevented plaintiffs\u2019 expert on human factors from expressing his opinion on the design of the machine in question, because he had no experience with that type of machine. The court based its reversal upon a finding that the excluded testimony was integrally related to plaintiffs\u2019 theory of the case which was a design defect. Denial of leave by this Court on July 19, 1979, resulted in remand for a second trial which commenced on January 16, 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">Plaintiffs\u2019 proofs in the 1978 and 1980 cases were identical and included the testimony of both Mr. Prentis and his wife, a treating physician, and two expert witnesses. In the 1980 trial, plaintiffs\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>counsel read into evidence the complete testimony of the two experts transcribed in the 1978 trial. The focus of plaintiffs\u2019 proofs at both trials was an alleged defect in the design of the forklift, and the substance of the expert witness\u2019 testimony was that the design of the forklift failed to properly incorporate the operator as a \"human factor\u201d into the machine\u2019s function, specifically because it did not provide a seat or platform for the operator.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> However, in the period between the Court of Appeals reversal and the second trial, Michigan had enacted the \"products liability statute,\u201d MCL 600.2945 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 27A.2945 <em>et seq., </em>which became effective on December 11, 1978, resulting in some confusion as to the proper legal principles to be applied in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-6\">During the course of trial, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>requested separate jury instructions on implied warranty and negligence theories,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> while counsel for defendant requested a unified jury instruction.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> After considerable discussion and argument and a careful review and analysis of the most recent case law under the new statute, the court instructed the jury on a unified standard of liability by using an amalgam of the common elements of proof under the implied warranty and negligence theories.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-4\">The trial judge instructed the jury on:</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">1) Defendant\u2019s duties and liabilities as a manufacturer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b831-6\">\"A manufacturer of a product made under a plan or design which makes it dangerous for uses for which it is manufactured is . . . subject to liability to others whom he should expect to use the product or to be endangered by its probable use from physical harm caused by his failure to exercise reasonable care in the adoption of a safe plan or design.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b831-7\">\u201dA manufacturer has a duty to use reasonable care in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>designing his product and guard it against a foreseeable and unreasonable risk of injury and this may even include misuse which might reasonably be anticipated.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">2) Negligent conduct of both plaintiff and defendant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b832-7\">\"Now when I use the word 'negligence* with respect to the Defendant\u2019s conduct, I mean the failure to do something which a reasonably careful person would do or the doing of something which a reasonably careful person would not do under the circumstances which you find existed in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b832-8\">\"It is for you to decide what a reasonably careful person would do or not do under the circumstances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b832-9\">\"When I use the words 'ordinary care,\u2019 I mean the care a reasonably careful person would use under the circumstances which you find existed in this case. The law does not say what a reasonably careful person would do or would not do under such circumstances. That is for you to decide.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b832-10\">\"Now it was the duty of the Plaintiff in connection with this occurrence to use reasonable care for his own safety, and it was the duty of the Defendant in connection with this occurrence to use ordinary care for the safety of the Plaintiff.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b832-11\">Following the jury instructions on liability, the court read both parties\u2019 written theories of the case to the jury, including plaintiffs\u2019 claims under both negligence and breach of warranty. The jury panel was then given a special verdict form which first asked the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b832-12\">\"Question No. 1: Was the motorized hand truck defectively designed by Yale Manufacturing Company?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b832-13\">\"Answer: \u2014 (Yes or No).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b832-14\">\"(If your answer is no, do not answer any further questions).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b832-15\">Question No. 1 was answered in the negative by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>the jury panel, and a judgment of no cause of action was entered by the trial court on February 28, 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-4\">Plaintiff filed a timely claim of appeal in the Court of Appeals. On May 20, 1982, the Court of Appeals issued a published per curiam opinion reversing the trial court judgment and remanding for a new trial. <em>Prentis v Yale, </em>116 Mich App 466; 323 NW2d 444 (1982). The Court of Appeals held that the trial court\u2019s failure to give the properly requested jury instruction on implied warranty was reversible error requiring a new trial. We granted defendant\u2019s application for leave to appeal on June 28, 1983. 417 Mich 1039 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">Analysis of the Current Status of the Law Regarding Manufacturers\u2019 Liability for Defective Design</p>\n<p id=\"b833-7\">The development of the law of tort liability for physical injury caused by products is perhaps the most striking and dramatic of all the numerous stories in the portfolio of modern tort scenarios.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> When the societal goal of holding manufacturers accountable for the safety of their products has been threatened by the interposition of technical rules of law, it has been the rules that have gradually given way.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b833-8\">However, this has never meant that courts have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>been willing to impose absolute liability in this context and from their earliest application, theories of products liability have been viewed as tort doctrines which should not be confused with the imposition of absolute liability. As this Court noted in <em>Piercefield v Remington Arms Co, Inc, </em>375 Mich 85, 98-99; 133 NW2d 129 (1965):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-6\">\"Some quibbler may allege that this is liability without fault. It is not. ... [A] plaintiff relying upon the rule must prove a defect attributable to the manufacturer and causal connection between that defect and the injury or damage of which he complains. When able to do that, then and only then may he recover against the manufacturer of the defective product.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b834-7\">Thus while courts have accepted the social policy rationale that those injured by defective products should be compensated for their injuries without being subject to the contractual intricacies of the law of sales, and have agreed that manufacturers can most effectively distribute the costs of injuries,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> they have never gone so far as to make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>sellers insurers of their products and thus absolutely liable for any and all injuries sustained from the use of those products.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b835-4\">Like the courts in every other state, whether a suit is based upon negligence or implied warranty, we require the plaintiff to prove that the product itself is actionable \u2014 that something is wrong with it that makes it dangerous. This idea of \"something wrong\u201d is usually expressed by the adjective \"defective\u201d and the plaintiff must, <em>in every case, in every jurisdiction, </em>show that the product was defective. See, <em>e.g., Piercefield, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">As a term of art, \"defective\u201d gives little difficulty when something goes wrong in the manufacturing process and the product is not in its intended condition. In the case of a \"manufacturing defect,\u201d the product may be evaluated against the manufacturer\u2019s own production standards, as manifested by that manufacturer\u2019s other like products.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">However, injuries caused by the condition of a product may also be actionable if the product\u2019s design, which is the result of intentional design decisions of the manufacturer, is not sufficiently safe. Conscious design defect cases provide no such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>simple test. The very question whether a defect in fact exists is central to a court\u2019s inquiry. It is only in design defect cases that a court is called upon to supply the standard for defectiveness.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Thus, the term \"defect\u201d in design cases is \"an epithet \u2014 an expression for the legal conclusion rather than a test for reaching that conclusion.\u201d See Wade, <em>On product \"design defects\u201d and their actionability, </em>33 Van L R 551, 552 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">At present, questions related to \"design defects\u201d and the determination of when a product is defective, because of the nature of its design, appear to be the most agitated and controversial issues before the courts in the field of products liability.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>number of appellate courts, aware that they are engaged in the conscious task of molding the law of products liability, have become concerned that they are not differentiating with sufficient clarity between various theories of recovery in design defect cases. In response, they have sought to devise significant and well-articulated distinctions.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> At the same time, other courts have become concerned that the differentiation is too great, and have attempted to devise means of keeping the broad scope of liability in check.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The result has been several cases in which the standard for liability in the design area has been very carefully examined by courts and often vigorously debated by the judges themselves. A survey of the important recent cases in neighboring jurisdictions suggests something of the creative ferment underlying what has been described as the \"rich tapestry\u201d of the developing common law of products liability.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b837-4\">The approaches for determination of the mean<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>ing of \u201cdefect\u201d in design cases fall into four general categories. The first, usually \u00a1associated with Dean Wade, employs a negligence risk-utility analysis, but focuses upon whether the manufacturer would be judged negligent if it had known of the product\u2019s dangerous condition at the time it was marketed.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The second, associated with Dean Keeton, compares the risk and utility of the product at the time of trial.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The third focuses on consumer expectations about the product.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The fourth combines the risk-utility and consumer-expectation tests.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> While courts have included many other individual variations in their formulations,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> the overwhelming consensus among courts deciding defective design cases is in the use of some form of risk-utility analysis, either as an exclusive or alternative ground of liability.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Risk-utility analysis in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>this context always involves assessment of the decisions made by manufacturers with respect to the design of their products.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-4\">\"The law purports to stand as a watchdog to ensure that product design decisions made by manufacturers do not expose product users to unreasonable risks of injury. Thus, in a design defect case, the issue is whether the manufacturer properly weighed the alternatives and evaluated the trade-oifs and thereby developed a reasonably safe product; the focus is unmistakably on the <em>quality </em>of the decision and whether the decision conforms to socially acceptable standards.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">The risk-utility balancing test is merely a detailed version of Judge Learned Hand\u2019s negligence calculus. See <em>United States v Carroll Towing Co, </em>159 F2d 169, 173 (CA 2, 1947). As Dean Prosser has pointed out, the liability of the manufacturer rests \"upon a departure from proper standards of care, so that the tort is essentially a matter of negligence.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">Although many courts have insisted that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>risk-utility tests they are applying are not negligence tests because their focus is on the <em>product </em>rather than the manufacturer\u2019s <em>conduct, </em>see, <em>e.g., Barker v Lull Engineering Co, Inc, </em>20 Cal 3d 413, 418; 143 Cal Rptr 225; 573 P2d 443 (1978), the distinction on closer examination appears to be nothing more than semantic. As a common-sense matter, the jury weighs competing factors presented in evidence and reaches a conclusion about the judgment or decision <em>(i.e., conduct) </em>of the manufacturer. The underlying negligence calculus is inescapable. As noted by Professor Birnbaum:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b840-6\">\"When a jury decides that the risk of harm outweighs the utility of a particular design (that the product is not as safe as it <em>should </em>be) it is saying that in choosing the particular design and cost trade-offs, the manufacturer exposed the consumer to greater risk of danger than he should have. Conceptually and analytically, this approach bespeaks negligence.\u201d Birnbaum, <em>Unmasking the test for design defect: From negligence [to warranty] to strict liability to negligence, 33 </em>Van L R 593, 610 (1980) (quoting <em>Barker v Lull Engineering, supra, </em>p 432) (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b840-7\">The competing factors to be weighed under a risk-utility balancing test invite the trier of fact to consider the alternatives and risks faced by the manufacturer and to determine whether in light of these the manufacturer exercised reasonable care in making the design choices it made. Instructing a jury that weighing factors concerning conduct and judgment must yield a conclusion that does not describe conduct is confusing at best.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-8\">The Model Uniform Product Liability Act was published in 1979 by the Department of Commerce for voluntary use by the states.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The act adopts a negligence or fault system with re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>spect to design defects.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> It is important to examine the rationale underlying the UPLA\u2019s adoption of negligence as the criteria for liability in design defect cases. The drafters rejected, as a reason for application of strict liability to design defect cases, the theory of risk distribution wherein the product seller distributes the costs of all product-related risks through liability insurance. They believe that a \"firmer liability foundation\u201d than strict liability is needed in a design defect case because the whole product line is at risk. Furthermore, the drafters believed that a fault system would provide greater incentives for loss prevention.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b841-4\">The approach--of the UPLA has been approved by several commentators, whose analysis is also instructive.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> First, unlike manufacturing defects, design defects result from deliberate and documentable decisions on the part of manufacturers, and plaintiffs should be able to learn the facts surrounding these decisions through liberalized modern discovery rules. Access to expert witnesses and technical data are available to aid plaintiffs in proving the manufacturer\u2019s design decision was ill considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">Second, to the extent that a primary purpose of products liability law is to encourage the design of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>safer products and thereby reduce the incidence of injuries, a negligence standard that would reward the careful manufacturer and penalize the careless is more likely to achieve that purpose. A greater incentive to design safer products will result from a fault system where resources devoted to careful and safe design will pay dividends in the form of fewer claims and lower insurance premiums for the manufacturer with a good design safety record. The incentive will result from the knowledge that a distinction is made between those who are careful and those who are not.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-4\">Third, a verdict for the plaintiff in a design defect case is the equivalent of a determination that an entire product line is defective. It usually will involve a significant portion of the manufacturer\u2019s assets and the public may be deprived of a product. Thus, the plaintiff should be required to pass the higher threshold of a fault test in order to threaten an entire product line. The traditional tort law of negligence better serves this purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">Fourth, a fault system incorporates greater intrinsic fairness in that the careful safety-oriented manufacturer will not bear the burden of paying for losses caused by the negligent product seller. It will also follow that the customers of the careful manufacturer will not through its prices pay for the negligence of the careless. As a final bonus, the careful manufacturer with fewer claims and lower insurance premiums may, through lower prices as well as safer products, attract the customers of less careful competitors.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">We find the formula adopted by the UPLA on the question of defective design to have the merit of being clear and understandable. We recognize that in products liability cases against manufacturers based upon alleged defects in the design of a product, the courts of this state have attempted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>to avoid both the notion of fault implicit in negligence and the harshness of no-fault implicit in absolute liability. Thus, on the basis of the heritage of contract and sales law underlying concepts of implied warranty, we have in the past approved instructions that attempted to focus a jury\u2019s attention on the condition of a product rather than on the reasonableness of the manufacturer\u2019s conduct or decision. We are persuaded that in so doing in the context of cases against the manufacturers of products <em>based upon allegations of defective design, </em>we have engaged in a process that may have served to confuse, rather than enlighten, jurors, who must ultimately apply understandable guidelines if they are to justly adjudicate the rights and duties of all parties. Imposing a negligence standard for design defect litigation is only to define in a coherent fashion what our litigants in this case are in fact arguing and what our jurors are in essence analyzing. Thus we adopt, forthrightly, a pure negligence, risk-utility test in products liability actions against manufacturers of products, where liability is predicated upon defective design.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">Application to the Facts of This Case</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">We hold that in this products liability action against a manufacturer for an alleged defect in the design of its product, where the jury was properly instructed on the theory of negligent design, the trial judge\u2019s refusal to instruct on breach of warranty was not reversible error. Such instructions could have created juror confusion and prejudicial error. Indeed, such an instruction would have been repetitive and unnecessary and could have misled the jury into believing that plaintiff could recover on the warranty count even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>if it found there was no \"defect\u201d in the design of the product. See <em>Smith v ER Squibb &amp; Sons, </em>405 Mich 79, 91; 273 NW2d 476 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">This opinion is limited solely to its facts. We do not suggest that implied warranty and negligence are not separate and distinct theories of recovery; see <em>Squibb, supra, </em>p 98 (Levin, J., <em>dissenting), </em>or that the Michigan products liability statute, MCL 600.2945; MSA 27A.2945, has merged all former products liability theories or causes of action into a single unified \"products liability theory.\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> We do not dispute the generally recognized distinction between the elements of negligence and breach of warranty. We recognize that the negligence theory generally focuses on the defendant\u2019s conduct, requiring a showing that it was unreasonable, while warranty generally focuses upon the fitness of the product, irrespective of the defendant\u2019s conduct. See <em>Squibb, supra, </em>pp 98-99 (Levin, J., <em>dissenting).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b844-7\">This holding is based upon the recognition that under the common law of products liability, in an action against the manufacturer of a product based upon an alleged defect in its design, \"breach of implied warranty and negligence involve identical evidence and require proof of exactly the same elements.\u201d See <em>Squibb, supra, </em>p 88. A manufacturer has a duty to design its product so as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>eliminate any unreasonable risk of foreseeable injury. <em>Owens v Allis-Chalmers Corp, </em>414 Mich 413, 425; 326 NW2d 372 (1982). For the lack of reasonable care in the face of such duty, the manufacturer may be answerable in a negligence action. <em>Elsasser v American Motors Corp, </em>81 Mich App 379, 384; 265 NW2d 339 (1978). When proceeding under a theory of implied warranty, a design defect is established by proof that the product is not reasonably safe for the uses intended, anticipated, or reasonably foreseeable. <em>Dooms v Stewart Bolling &amp; Co, </em>68 Mich App 5, 14; 241 NW2d 738 (1976), <em>Iv den </em>397 Mich 862 (1976). For the sale of a product defective in such respect, the seller may be answerable for breach of an implied warranty. <em>Elsasser, supra. </em>Thus, when the issue is liability of a manufacturer who was also the seller, it is inconceivable that a jury could determine that the manufacturer had not breached its duty of reasonable care and at the same time find that the product was not reasonably safe for its reasonably foreseeable uses. The question in either case turns on reasonable care and reasonable safety, and as pointed out by Dean Prosser, the liability of the manufacturer rests \"upon a departure from proper standards of care so that the tort is essentially a matter of negligence.\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b845-4\">Applying these principles to the facts of this case, although plaintiffs alleged that their injuries were proximately caused by defendant\u2019s negligence and breach of an implied warranty, their evidence and proofs at trial focused on the single claim that the defendant <em>defectively designed </em>the \"walkie hi-lo\u201d forklift, because it failed to provide a seat or platform for the operator. Thus, recovery under either theory required the jury to determine that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>the forklift was defectively designed by defendant. <em>Caldwell v Fox, </em>394 Mich 401; 231 NW2d 46 (1975). The factual inquiry was: whether the design of defendant\u2019s forklift was \"unreasonably dangerous\u201d because it did not contain a seat or platform for the operator. See <em>Owens, supra, </em>p 427.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\">The test for determining whether the design was \"unreasonably dangerous\u201d was: whether the alleged defect in the design of the product created an unreasonable risk of foreseeable injury. <em>Elsasser, supra. </em>Stated another way, whether the manufacturer was under a duty to use reasonable care to design a product that was reasonably safe for its intended, anticipated, or reasonably foreseeable uses. <em>Dooms v Stewart Bolling, supra, </em>p 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">The trial court properly recognized that the standards of liability under the theories of implied warranty and negligence were indistinguishable and that instructions on both would only confuse the jury. Accordingly, the trial judge\u2019s instructions regarding the standard of care and theories of liability properly informed the jury of defendant\u2019s legal duties as the manufacturer of the forklift. The court set forth the necessary elements for determining whether defendant defectively designed the forklift when it stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b846-6\">\"A manufacturer of a product made under a plan or design which makes it dangerous for uses for which it is manufactured is[, however,] subject to liability to others whom he should expect to use the product or to be endangered by its probable use from physical harm caused by his failure to exercise reasonable care in the adoption of a safe plan or design.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b846-7\">\"A manufacturer has a duty to use reasonable care in designing his product and guard it against a foreseeable and unreasonable risk of injury and this may even include misuse which might reasonably be anticipated.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b846-8\">In essence, the jury was instructed to consider <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>whether the manufacturer took reasonable care in light of any reasonably foreseeable use of the product which might cause harm or injury. <em>Caldwell v Fox, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b847-4\">Therefore we hold that in a products liability action against a manufacturer, based upon defective design, the jury need only be instructed on a single unified theory of negligent design.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the judgment of the trial court is reinstated.</p>\n<judges id=\"b847-6\">Williams, C.J., and Ryan and Brickley, JJ., concurred with Boyle, J.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b847-7\">Cavanagh, J., concurred in the result only.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b826-14\"> The first took place in 1976, the second in 1980.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b827-8\"> The first reversal was based upon the trial court\u2019s exclusion of a portion of the testimony of one of plaintiffs\u2019 expert witnesses on the alleged design defect.

In only one of the five cited cases would the court look to the manufacturer\u2019s conduct to determine liability, and in that case the court\u2019s statement was dictum.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">Dean Keeton advocated weighing the risk and utility of the product at the time of trial.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Keeton would use hindsight to allocate to the manufacturer all risks including those which were <em>unknowable </em>at the time of marketing.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> While a manufacturer could not be found <em>negligent </em>for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>failing to protect against an unknowable risk, Keeton would nevertheless hold the manufacturer subject to liability for designing a defective <em>product.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">Professor Wade\u2019s position \"has been characterized as a risk utility test with imputed knowledge of all risks 'knowable\u2019 at the time of manufacture or sale.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Although this approach considers manufacturer conduct, Wade\u2019s proffered jury instruction focuses on the product: \"A <em>[product] </em>is not duly safe if it is so likely to be harmful to persons [or property] that a reasonable <em>[sic] </em>prudent manufacturer [supplier], who had actual knowledge of <em>its harmful character </em>would not place it on the market.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b852-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b852-7\">Nor is it true that there is a basis for distinguishing between design defect and other products liability cases. Evidence of negligence is not more readily uncovered in design defect cases than in manufacturing defect cases. Professors Twerski and Weinstein observed that \"[t]here is perhaps no issue more difficult for a plaintiff to litigate than what the state of knowledge should have been for a manufacturer with expertise in his field.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b852-8\">In a manufacturing defect case, there may be documents, technical data, and expert witness testimony demonstrating that the manufacturer took all reasonable and, indeed, extraordinary precau<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>tions to avoid manufacturing defects. Such a manufacturer deserves no less protection than a manufacturer who used reasonable care in designing a product which nevertheless was not reasonably fit. If we are to return to an incentive-deterrence model, there is arguably as much to be gained, from a societal point of view, in extending that concept to manufacturing defects.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b853-4\">To be sure, a verdict that there is a design defect may be seen as an indictment of an entire product line. It does not follow that a jury verdict holding against the manufacturer will result in the public being deprived of the product; litigation will have stretched out over years before such a verdict is rendered and then there are appeals and, as in this case, retrial and further appeals\u2014 this action was commenced August 24, 1972, twelve years ago. The likelihood is that, taking into consideration what is learned in the litigation, the manufacturer will, measuring risk-utility, make such improvements in the product as it finds desirable. It has not been shown that there is need <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>for a lower standard for design defect cases than in manufacturing defect cases in order to protect either the \"manufacturer\u2019s assets\u201d or the public from being deprived of a product.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b854-7\">Assuming, as the opinion of the Court states, that implicit in a jury verdict that a product was\u2014 applying the implied warranty standard \u2014 \"defectively designed,\u201d is a determination that the manufacturer acted unreasonably in the design; the question of the reasonableness of the manufacturer\u2019s conduct and the reasonableness of the product, even in a design defect case, are not indistinguishable or identical.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-8\">The spectrum of what is reasonable is broad. If it were otherwise, all reasonable men and women would agree, and there would be nothing for jury assessment. Different juries looking at the same facts may reach different conclusions regarding what is reasonable and both verdicts may be unimpeachable. It is for this reason that the answer may depend on how the question is phrased.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b854-9\">The opinion of the Court does not cite a single case where a jury was instructed as it would have juries instructed henceforth in this state. Cases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>cited by the Court<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> appear to recognize that the proper inquiry is whether the product is reasonably fit for its intended or foreseeable purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-4\">While, as a matter of logic, a jury might not bring in a verdict both that the manufacturer had not breached its duty of reasonable care and that the design of the product was not reasonably safe for its reasonably foreseeable uses, it is not, as the opinion of the Court declares, \"inconceivable\u201d that a jury would do so. Experience has shown that juries do just that. They do find a manufacturer not at fault, but the product, nevertheless, defective. The form of the question often preordains and directs the answer.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The need or desirability of obviating juror confusion does not, we repeat, decide what is the correct form of the inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">We would affirm the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<judges id=\"b855-6\">Kavanagh, J., concurred with Levin,</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b847-10\"> <em>Ante, </em>p 679.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b847-11\"> <em>Ante, </em>p 694.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b848-9\"> <em>Ante, </em>p 694.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"AyXH\"><em> Ante, </em>pp 694-695.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"AUn\"> <em>Ante, </em>p 695.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b849-6\"> See <em>Cova v Harley Davidson Motor Co, 26 </em>Mich App 602; 182 NW2d 800 (1970), advocating the adoption of a single unified theory of products liability.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b849-7\"> MCL 600.2945-600.2949; MSA 27A.2945-27A.2949.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b849-8\"> Amicus curiae Michigan Defense Trial Counsel contends only that \"[mjanufacturers have a duty to produce a <em>product </em>which is not unreasonably dangerous in light of the foreseeable risks of injury,\u201d \"a <em>product </em>which is not unreasonably dangerous in light of the foreseeable risk of injury.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b849-9\"> See, Comment: <em>Products liability in Michigan: Implied warranty, strict tort, or both?, </em>15 Wayne L R 1558, 1580 (1969) (\"In <em>Piercefield v Remington Arms Co, </em>the Michigan Supreme Court adopted the strict tort doctrine under the guise of the implied warranty theory\u201d).

In the development of product safety, there may be several ways to address a safety hazard. One way may be to increase quality control to assure the integrity of a crucial part. Another may be to design a back-up safety feature (a fail-safe component). By deciding that construction defect cases are not defensible (in that strict liability applies regardless of fault), and that design defect cases are defensible (on negligence or risk-utility grounds), the UPLL has made a conscious decision to favor the design alternative over quality control. This may be a short-sighted approach. It is possible that increased safety can be accomplished at a lower cost by raising quality control standards rather than by designing a fail-safe system that could engender other risks. The difficulty is that the litigation categories have been created by lawyers. Engineers who must think in functional terms may find the framework totally unsatisfactory.\u201d Twerski, fn 17 <em>supra, </em>p 226.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b854-10\"> Addressing the fourth and final \"intrinsic fairness\u201d argument, if a careful manufacturer is rewarded with lower insurance premiums based on his products liability experience, then without regard to whether there is a fault or a product defect system, that manufacturer will not bear the burden of paying for losses caused by a manufacturer with a less satisfactory product liability experience.
