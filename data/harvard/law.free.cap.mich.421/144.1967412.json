We hold that such insurer is responsible.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b298-10\">Defendant Carson City Texaco, Inc., owned a heating oil delivery truck which it delivered to Tank Truck Service Company, Inc., for maintenance. A fire occurred, causing damage to Tank Truck\u2019s property. Plaintiff Michigan Mutual Insurance Co., Tank Truck\u2019s insurer, paid benefits to Tank Truck for the damage to the premises. Michigan Mutual, as subrogee of Tank Truck, sued Carson City Texaco and its motor vehicle insurer, State Farm Insurance Co., for reimbursement of the insurance benefits paid by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-11\">Plaintiff alleged that the fire resulted from the maintenance of the delivery truck. Plaintiff further alleged that the no-fault insurer of the truck was legally responsible to pay property protection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>benefits under MCL 500.3121(1); MSA 24.13121(1) for accidental damage to tangible property arising out of the maintenance of a motor vehicle. Defendants moved for summary judgment, GCR 1963, 117.2(1), which was granted. Plaintiffs motion for summary judgment, GCR 1963, 117.2(3), was denied by the trial court on the grounds that \u00a7 3121(1) was never intended to apply to the factual situation alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">The Court of Appeals reversed. <em>Michigan Mutual Ins Co v Carson City Texaco, Inc, </em>123 Mich App 240; 333 NW2d 235 (1983). The Court concluded that the property damage arose out of the maintenance of the insured\u2019s truck. Accordingly, the motor vehicle insurer was responsible to pay property protection insurance benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">Defendants argue that the no-fault act was never intended to apply to these circumstances. The decision of the Court of Appeals, argue defendants, expands coverage and increases the cost of insurance, contrary to the policies of the no-fault act. They assert that the decision also nullifies the provisions of the garage keeper\u2019s liability act, MCL 256.541 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 9.1721 <em>et seq., </em>despite the absence of any legislative intent to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-9\">The no-fault act provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-10\">\"(1) Under property protection insurance an insurer is liable to pay benefits for accidental damage to tangible property arising out of the ownership, operation, maintenance or use of a motor vehicle as a motor vehicle subject to the provisions of this section and sections 3123, 3125 and 3127.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-11\">\"(2) Property protection insurance benefits are due under the conditions stated in this chapter without regard to fault.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>\"(3) Damage to tangible property consists of physical injury to or destruction of the property and loss of use of the property so injured or destroyed.\u201d MCL 500.3121; MSA 24.13121.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">Maintenance is not defined by the act. We have said, however, that in addition to the meaning appearing from the common sense of the word, \" '[t]he \"maintenance\u201d aspect of the \"ownership, maintenance use\u201d clause covers the act of repairing the covered automobile.\u2019 \u201d <em>Miller v Auto-Owners Ins Co, </em>411 Mich 633, 639; 309 NW2d 544 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">This definition of maintenance differs from the definition given the term by the drafters of the Uniform Motor Vehicle Accident Reparations Act, \"one of the model acts utilized as source material in the drafting of the no-fault act.\u201d <em>Citizens Ins Co v Tuttle, </em>411 Mich 536, 546; 309 NW2d 174 (1981). The uniform act defines maintenance so as to exclude the business of maintenance. \"Maintenance or use of a motor vehicle does not include (i) conduct within the course of a business of repairing, servicing, or otherwise maintaining motor vehicles. . . .\u201d 14 ULA, Civil Procedural and Remedial Laws, \u00a7 l(a)(6)(i), p 51. According to the official comment to related \u00a7 5(a)(2), referring to \u00a7 1(a)(6), \"[t]he primary purpose of that provision is to disallow basic reparation benefits to a person injured by automobile maintenance activities in a motor vehicle service garage. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">The absence of a comparable provision in the Michigan act persuades us that the Legislature did not intend to exclude property protection benefits under circumstances like those alleged by plaintiffs. In drawing on UMVARA as a model, the Legislature presumably considered the proposed definition of maintenance and rejected it. In any event, the language of \u00a7 3121(1), providing \"bene<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>fits for accidental damage to tangible property-arising out of the . . . maintenance or use of a motor vehicle as a motor vehicle\u201d easily encompasses the circumstances of the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\">We conclude that if property damage arises out of the maintenance of a motor vehicle as a motor vehicle, even in the course of a business of maintaining motor vehicles, an insurer is liable to pay benefits for accidental damage to tangible property under property protection insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">The garage keeper\u2019s liability act, MCL 256.541 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 9.1721 <em>et seq., </em>is irrelevant. That act merely declares that proof of damage to a motor vehicle which is in the possession of a garage keeper is prima facie evidence of the negligent act of such keeper. See MCL 256.541; MSA 9.1721. It alone does not render the garage keeper liable. Moreover, the act applies to damage to motor vehicles, not to the damage to the garage keeper\u2019s premises for which recovery is sought here.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">Defendants also argue that the Court of Appeals concluded erroneously that the property damage arose out of the maintenance of a motor vehicle. Defendants say that the damage arose out of the negligence of a garage mechanic in placing a light bulb in a location where gasoline was spilled on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">There is no disagreement that the truck was being maintained. Defendants contend, however, that because the parts of the truck being repaired were its oil delivery system, the truck was not being maintained as a motor vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">We are not convinced by appellant\u2019s argument that calibrating the fuel delivery meter did not, as a matter of law constitute maintenance of the truck as a motor vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-9\">When a specially equipped motor vehicle is brought in for maintenance service and work is being performed on it, it is of little consequence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>which part is being serviced. Whether the maintenance work is concerned with its motor, drive train, radio, heater, oil delivery equipment, upholstery, or other part of the vehicle, the Michigan no-fault act contemplates coverage for damages arising out of such maintenance.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">We agree with defendants, however, that the Court of Appeals should not have resolved the question whether the property damage arose out of the maintenance of the truck. The pleadings put this question in issue and should be resolved in the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">The decision of the Court of Appeals, as modified, is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b302-8\">Levin, Brickley, Cavanagh, and Boyle, JJ., concurred with Kavanagh, J.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b302-9\">Williams, C.J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aig\"><em>(concurring). </em>The rules of statutory construction compel me to concur with the well-reasoned opinion of my brother Kavanagh. But justice requires me to declare that the result of this opinion is contrary both to the philosophy of the no-fault act and to good public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-10\">The plain language of the statute, reinforced by the legislative history, as recognized by Justice Kavanagh\u2019s opinion, mandates the conclusion reached. But the result is almost incredible. A garage keeper, whose employee\u2019s negligence in repairing a vehicle left for maintenance and resulting in damage to that vehicle and to the garage, is rewarded by reparations from the insurer of the owner of the damaged vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-11\">Without the effect of the no-fault act, under the garage keeper\u2019s liability act, proof of damage such as occurred here would be prima facie evidence that the garage keeper would be liable in damages to the vehicle owner. MCL 256.541; MSA 9.1721. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>The garage owner would suffer the damages to the garage.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\">The untoward result of this opinion offends the philosophy of the no-fault act and good public policy in two ways. First, it violates the no-fault act\u2019s objective of reducing the \"high costs\u201d inherent in the preexisting tort system. <em>Shavers v Attorney General, </em>402 Mich 554, 578; 267 NW2d 72 (1978). No-fault reparation of the garage keeper because of his own employee\u2019s negligence by the vehicle owner\u2019s insurer increases rather than contains the cost of the system. Second, such reparation is to a non-premium paying, non-member of the no-fault system by the insurer of a vehicle owner who is without fault. Thus, a burden is put on the premium payers without justifiable reason or any discernible public benefit. See <em>Citizens Ins Co v Tuttle, </em>411 Mich 536, 546-547; 309 NW2d 174 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">In sum, judicial restraint in statutory interpretation unfortunately compels a result flying in the face of the policy of the no-fault act and commonsense justice.</p>\n<judges id=\"b303-6\">Ryan and Boyle, JJ., concurred with Williams, C.J.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
