He went to the facility\u2019s first-aid room complaining of a cough and was given what appeared to be cough syrup. Plaintiff drank the liquid and suffered injury. Subsequent analysis disclosed that the liquid he drank contained lye or other chemical substances generally found in cleaning fluid. Plaintiff instituted this negligence action against the individual defendants, employees of the Michigan Department of Corrections. We granted leave following the Court of Appeals reversal of the defendants\u2019 summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-5\">Pursuant to the rule announced in the recently decided <em>Ross v Consumers Power Co, </em>420 Mich 567; 363 NW2d 641 (1984), we need only determine whether the activities complained of in the instant case are \"discretionary-decisional\u201d or \"ministerial-operational.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b927-6\">The Court of Appeals analyzed plaintiff\u2019s negligence allegations as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b927-7\">\"Plaintiff, in his complaint, alleged that defendants failed to properly supervise the employees and personnel entrusted with the care of the first-aid room. Since this contention can be readily construed as an allegation that defendants\u2019 supervisory acts fell short of established procedures, this Court finds that defendants\u2019 complained-of acts were ministerial. See <em>Vargo v Svitchan </em>[100 Mich App 809, 816; 301 NW2d 1 (1980)], and <em>Cook [v Bennett, </em>94 Mich App 93, 101; 288 NW2d 609 (1979)]. Plaintiff\u2019s allegations that defendants breached their duties to keep the first-aid area locked and to see that the medicines were not tampered with can similarly be construed as allegations that defendants neglected to follow established security procedures, and thus that these alleged acts or omissions were ministerial. Therefore, the lower court erred in finding that defendants\u2019 acts were protected under governmental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>immunity and in granting summary judgment on that basis.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b928-3\">We are in agreement with this analysis and affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<judges id=\"b928-4\">Williams, C.J., and Levin, Ryan, Brickley, and Boyle, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b928-5\">Cavanagh and Riley, JJ., took no part in the decision of this case.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
