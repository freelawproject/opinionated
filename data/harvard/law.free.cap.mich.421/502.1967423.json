The first is whether a search warrant based on an affidavit issued in violation of MCL 780.653; MSA 28.1259(3), is invalid, and evidence obtained is required to be excluded. The second is whether this Court should reject the 'Aguila<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>-Spinelli<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> test\u201d heretofore applied by Michigan courts<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and substitute the totality of the circumstances test recently announced by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Illinois v Gates.</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">We conclude that the search and seizure was based upon an invalid search warrant and must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>excluded. This conclusion is mandated by the statute. Our decision makes it unnecessary to decide whether Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 11,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> incorporates the concepts of the <em>Aguilar-Spinelli </em>test.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">John J. Sherbine, II, was found guilty of first-degree murder.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> His conviction was reversed, and the cause remanded for a new trial because of the receipt in evidence of confessions and admissions that the Court of Appeals found should have been suppressed.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> While the appeal was pending, and subsequent to the reversal of his conviction, Sherbine made several collect telephone calls to Joseph Franklin Bradway, Jr.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-8\">These telephone calls began in \"late August or early September of 1982\u201d and continued until November of 1983. A number of these conversations were recorded pursuant to a search warrant issued on September 9, 1983, and the prosecution attempted to introduce these tape recordings into evidence at Sherbine\u2019s trial. The circuit judge, however, granted Sherbine\u2019s motion to suppress the tape recordings. The Court of Appeals denied the prosecution\u2019s application for leave to appeal.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This Court granted leave to appeal.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We now affirm the circuit court._</p>\n<p id=\"b659-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b659-4\">It is well established that before a search warrant may be issued the law enforcement officer seeking the warrant must establish probable cause to believe that incriminating evidence may be found in a specific location.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> This showing of probable cause is generally accomplished by a sworn affidavit setting forth all the facts known through personal observations and hearsay to the affiant. In this state, the contents of the affidavit is provided by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">The statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-6\">\"The magistrate\u2019s finding of reasonable or probable cause shall be based upon all the facts related within the affidavit made before him. The affidavit may be based upon reliable information supplied to the complainant from a <em>credible person, named or unnamed, </em>so long as the affidavit contains affirmative allegations that the person spoke with personal knowledge of the matters contained therein.\u201d MCL 780.653; MSA 28.1259(3). (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">The question presented is whether the affidavit in support of the search warrant satisfied the requirements of the second sentence of the statute. We conclude that it did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-8\">The affidavit stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-9\">\"D. On the morning of September 8, 1983, your affiant conducted an interview with Joseph Franklin Bradway, Jr. at the Jackson County Sheriffs Department with reference to telephone conversations between himself and John Sherbine concerning the murder of LeRoy Earl Crenshaw.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-10\">\"E. Mr. Bradway related to your affiant that he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>been friends with John Sherbine since October of 1978. That Mr. Bradway started receiving collect telephone calls from John Sherbine in late August or early September of 1982. That during the course of these conversations John Sherbine would, of his own accord begin to discuss various items related to the murder of LeRoy Crenshaw. That Mr. Sherbine has continued to call Mr. Bradway, collect since that time, and in fact, he has called at least 10 times and has discussed the murder of LeRoy Crenshaw on at least half of these occasions. The nature and detail of these conversations has become more detailed and explicit with each succeeding phone call. Mr. Bradway expects to keep receiving telephone calls from Mr. Sherbine. The last telephone call from John Sherbine was received by Mr. Bradway at 1:30 p.m. on September 7, 1983.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">The statute supplements the search and seizure jurisprudence that had been developed by this Court and the United States Supreme Court. The statute provides that probable cause may be developed through the use of hearsay. The leading cases allowing the use of informant hearsay are <em>Aguilar </em>and <em>Spinelli. </em>The statutory provision, enacted as part of a comprehensive codification of search warrant practice and procedure,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> was a codification and expansion of the rule enunciated in <em>Aguilar.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">In <em>Aguilar, </em>two Houston police officers applied for, and obtained, a search warrant upon the basis of informant-supplied information. The informant was identified only as a \"credible person,\u201d a conclusion that was unsupported by any other allegation or assertion of fact. The balance of the affidavit consisted of conclusory statements that the informant had supplied \"reliable information\u201d and that the affiants believed that specified drugs were in a particular location. A search warrant was issued on the basis of the affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>The United States Supreme Court held that the search warrant was invalid and the evidence should have been suppressed. In so holding, the Court developed a two-pronged test to assess whether an affidavit based on hearsay establishes probable cause. The first requirement is that \"the magistrate must be informed of some of the underlying circumstances from which the informant concluded that the [evidence was] where he claimed [it was].\u201d <em>Aguilar, supra, </em>p 114. Second, the affiant must provide \"some of the underlying circumstances from which [he] concluded that the informant, whose identity need not be disclosed . . . was 'credible\u2019 or his information 'reliable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court said: \"The affidavit here not only 'contains no affirmative allegation that the affiant spoke with personal knowledge of the matters contained therein,\u2019 it does not even contain an 'affirmative allegation\u2019 that the affiant\u2019s unidentified source 'spoke with personal knowledge.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>p 113, quoting <em>Giordenello v United States, </em>357 US 480; 78 S Ct 1245; 2 L Ed 2d 1503 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-4\">The Legislature, in enacting the statutory provision, codified both requirements of the <em>Aguilar </em>decision. The statute, however, has three requirements, not two. The first is that the affidavit, when based on informant-supplied information, must contain affirmative allegations that the informant spoke with personal knowledge. The second is that the affidavit must set forth facts from which one may conclude that the informant is \"credible.\u201d Because \"credible\u201d modifies the entire phrase \"named or unnamed,\u201d the statute requires that proof of the informant\u2019s credibility must be presented in the affidavit whenever it is based on informant-supplied information. The naming of the informant is a factor to be considered in assessing credibility; however, it is not disposi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>tive.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The statute requires in every case that the credibility of the informant be shown, unlike <em>Aguilar, </em>which allows a choice between a showing of informant credibility and information reliability. The third is that the information must be shown to be reliable. The Legislature has determined that probable cause is not established until all three requirements have been satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">An informant\u2019s credibility must be shown by an assertion of facts tending to support a finding of credibility. While proof of credibility may be accomplished in different ways,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> facts tending to show credibility must appear on the face of the affidavit. Here, no facts showing Bradway\u2019s credibility were set forth in the affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">The courts have consistently held that the issuing magistrate must be supplied with \"some of the underlying circumstances supporting the conclusion that the person supplying the information is reliable.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The emphasis upon credibility is strong.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>The affidavit in question fails to meet the requirements of informant credibility and informational reliability. Conspicuously absent is any allegation, supported or unsupported by the underlying facts, that Bradway is a credible person. The affidavit fails to even reach the level of a bare conclusory statement that Bradway is a \"credible person.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The affidavit does not show that Brad-way had given reliable information about the telephone conversations.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The affidavit is deficient under the statute, the warrant invalid, and the tape recordings were properly suppressed by the circuit judge.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>In <em>People v </em>Dixon,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> this Court ordered the suppression of evidence when the police failed to accord the defendant a statutory right and such noncompliance resulted in incriminating evidence.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">Oregon also has codified its procedures for the issuance of search warrants. In <em>State v Russell, </em>293 Or 469; 650 P2d 79 (1982), the Supreme Court of Oregon suppressed evidence because of noncompliance with its statute.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">The statutory violation here is clear. The statute requires proof that the informant who supplied the information be credible. The affidavit here failed to satisfy this requirement. The evidence must therefore be suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b664-9\">Williams, C.J., and Kavanagh and Cavanagh, JJ., concurred with Levin, J._</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b657-8\"> <em>Aguilar v Texas, </em>378 US 108; 84 S Ct 1509; 12 L Ed 2d 723 (1964).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b657-9\"> <em>Spinelli v United States, </em>393 US 410; 89 S Ct 584; 21 L Ed 2d 637 (1969).

Indeed, an affidavit containing such a bald assertion, without any underlying facts supporting such an allegation, would be as deficient as the affidavit in the instant case. See <em>Aguilar, supra; People v Gleason, </em>122 Mich App 482, 493; 333 NW2d 85 (1983); <em>Davis, supra, </em>p 25; <em>People v Hill, </em>44 Mich App 308, 315; 205 NW2d 267 (1973); <em>People v Zoder, </em>15 Mich App 118; 166 NW2d 289 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-9\">Acceptance of such a conclusory statement by an issuing magistrate would be an abdication of his judicial function.

There is no question that the information, if reliable (and that can be supplied by either some extrinsic validation of some of the information by the affiant or by some assertion by the affiant of the informant\u2019s credibility), would supply more than the requisite probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">Because I think neither the constitutional nor the statutory requirements were met, I concur with the suppression of the evidence resulting from the use of the search warrant.</p>\n<judges id=\"b665-6\">Boyle, J. I dissent.</judges>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">The Michigan statute, MCL 780.653; MSA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>28.1259(3), on which Justice Levin relies for his conclusion, was first enacted as 1966 PA 189, two years after the decision in <em>Aguilar v Texas, </em>378 US 108; 84 S Ct 1509; 12 L Ed 2d 723 (1964). I find it highly unlikely that the statute was intended to expand <em>Aguilar. </em>I conclude that it is more likely that it was intended to codify the concepts articulated therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">The fundamental issue in every search warrant case is whether probable cause to believe that the evidence is in the place to be searched has been shown. Since it is the neutral and detached magistrate who must make this decision, not the affiant, the affidavit must allege facts which permit that determination to be made. <em>Giordenello v United States, </em>357 US 480; 78 S Ct 1245; 2 L Ed 2d 1503 (1958). An affidavit which indicates that the affiant spoke with personal knowledge of the matters contained therein identifies the source of the affiant\u2019s belief. <em>Id. </em>The rule of <em>Aguilar </em>was simply that \"[although an affidavit may be based on hearsay information and need not reflect the direct personal observations of the affiant, <em>Jones v United States, </em>362 US 257 [80 S Ct 725; 4 L Ed 2d 697 (1960)], [in such cases] the magistrate must be informed of some of the underlying circumstances from which the informant concluded that the [evidence was] where he claimed [it was], and some of the underlying circumstances from which the officer concluded that the informant . . . was 'credible\u2019 <em>or </em>his information 'reliable.\u2019 \u201d 378 US 114 (emphasis added; citations omitted). The requirement was not that the unnamed person be shown to be credible as that term is used in a courtroom, but rather was a requirement that the affiant show the magistrate why the information was believable.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">Informant credibility or reliability is thus a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>vehicle for demonstrating to the magistrate <em>why </em>the affiant believes the evidence is in the place for which the warrant is sought. I believe a commonsense interpretation of the statute is as follows: it authorizes a warrant to issue on the basis of hearsay information from an unnamed person so long as the information is reliable or the informant is credible, provided that the affidavit in such case contains allegations that the unnamed person spoke with personal knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-4\">For example, where the information provided was that an unnamed informer had previously provided correct information on 200 occasions, this information would be both credible and reliable. The construction of the statute advanced by Justice Levin would require that in every case, whether named or unnamed, proof of the informant\u2019s credibility must be shown. This construction would take us to the quite remarkable conclusion, that if one of the justices provided the police with information that he or she had received a series of threatening phone calls and expected to receive another, a magistrate would not be warranted in issuing a warrant unless the affiant officer also provided proof that the justice is credible <em>and </em>that the information is reliable. It would also prevent issuance of a search warrant where the affiant is communicating incriminating statements made to him by a third party. If the communication is, \"I will have the drugs at my home tonight,\u201d this is surely reliable information, but I doubt that the speaker could be independently shown to be a credible person.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">To the extent that the statute is ambiguous, I can see no basis for construing it in a manner which would require a greater showing than any decision of the United States Supreme Court has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>ever suggested, particularly where it will produce such anomalous results.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">Applying this analysis to the facts of the warrant in the instant case, in light of the ultimate issue, that is, has the affiant demonstrated why he believes the information will be where he says it is and is it reasonable to so believe, I conclude first that the affidavit does contain allegations that the provider of the information spoke with personal knowledge. He was the recipient of the phone calls and heard the conversations. Second, the combination of the name of the informant, his long-term relationship with Sherbine, the number of calls received, and the fact that they had become increasingly detailed in regard to the murder of LeRoy Crenshaw (a murder for which defendant had been once convicted, and was then awaiting retrial)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> were such as to permit a reasonably prudent person to conclude that a phone call from Sherbine would probably include reference to the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">Finally, even were I to conclude that the statute should be read as requiring a third requirement, I would not conclude that suppression is required. The affidavit meets the test set forth in <em>Aguilar, supra, </em>or <em>Illinois v Gates, </em>462 US 213; 103 S Ct 2317; 76 L Ed 2d 527 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">I cannot conceive of a reason why we should apply the exclusionary rule to the supposed violation of a statute where the affidavit would pass constitutional muster under either Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 11, or US Const, Am IV, see <em>People v Nash, </em>418 Mich 196; 341 NW2d 439 (1983).</p>\n<judges id=\"b668-7\">Ryan, J., concurred with Boyle, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b668-8\"> These facts were not presented in the affidavit.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
