Hammons committed suicide on December 26, 1974. Pamela Hammons, his former wife, filed a claim for death benefits under the workers\u2019 compensation act on her own behalf and on behalf of her minor children. A hearing referee denied benefits. The WCAB reversed and awarded benefits \"having found that decedent\u2019s profound emotional disorder, which led to his suicide, was produced by a combination of non-work-related and work-related factors. <em>Deziel v Difco Laboratories, Inc (After Remand), </em>403 Mich 1 [268 NW2d 1] (1978).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">Hammons, an 18-year veteran of the Highland Park Police Department, had advanced to the rank of corporal and was working as an acting temporary sergeant at the time of his death. The WCAB appears to have adopted the testimony of witnesses who \"all agreed that [Hammons] desperately wanted and strove for a promotion to sergeant in 1974.\u201d He had taken a promotional examination in 1972 and was at the top of the list. One week before his death, he learned that \"his chances for future promotion were considerably reduced.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The WCAB said, adopting the testimony of witnesses, that his reaction was to become \"very upset\u201d and \"very depressed.\u201d Detective Grimm <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>related a conversation with Hammons on the morning of his death that \"revolved around decedent\u2019s depression about the dropping of the complaint [to require the city to restore sergeant posts that it had eliminated] and his feeling that he would never get the promotion that he so very greatly wanted. It appeared that decedent had been crying.\u201d In addition, Hammons was disturbed about having to return to the ranks after working as acting sergeant. Hammons told his son that \"he didn\u2019t feel that he would be able to work with his fellow officers again because of the bad feelings\u201d created when he \"had to supervise and report on\u201d them. The opinion of the WCAB referred to a note, written by Hammons immediately before his death, that said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-4\">\"Where is the End (ask Grimm). The pressure &amp; the agony is just too great to bear. To notify [an aunt, a cousin, and sons and daughters] Love to all. Arlie C. Hammons.\u201d \"Ace,\u201d \"I have been very unhappy the last <em>30 </em>years.\u201d (Emphasis in the original.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">The WCAB stated that its review of the record persuaded it that Hammons\u2019 \"desire for advancement was a major subject of discussion and preoccupation during his final year of life.\u201d The WCAB found \"that his disappointment in this endeavor, coupled with real and with anticipated problems with co-workers, were major factors in the development of decedent\u2019s extreme depression and resultant suicide.\u201d The WCAB said that it had rejected testimony of the city\u2019s expert witness that Hammons\u2019 \"emotional state and death were the direct result of his non-work-related problems and not at all contributed to by any difficulties in his employment. We find more reasonable the opinion of [Mrs. Hammons\u2019 expert witness] that both work-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>related and non-work-related problems combined to produce decedent\u2019s illness and death. The existence of those non-work-related difficulties does not negate the compensability of the work-related factors. <em>Kepsel v McCready &amp; Sons, </em>345 Mich 335 [76 NW2d 30] (1956).\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>The WCAB denied Mrs. Hammons benefits, stating that she is precluded from obtaining benefits because she was no longer married to or living with Hammons at the time of his death.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Death benefits were awarded to daughters born in 1960 and 1966.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">The Court of Appeals denied leave to appeal.

The other three justices sitting in the case, in an opinion by Justice Carr, said that compensation should be denied because the general rule, as set forth in <em>Sponatski\u2019s Case, </em>220 Mass 526; 108 NE 466 (1915), and subsequent decisions, is that workers\u2019 compensation benefits are not recoverable because of the suicide of a worker \"injured in the course of his employment, such injury arising therefrom, unless as a proven result the suicide has occurred in a moment of insane frenzy or because of irresistible impulse. Deliberate planning of an act of suicide, with mental ability to understand the nature of the act, involves the introduction of an intervening cause in the chain of circumstances to which cause the death must be attributed.\u201d <em>Trombley, </em>p 660. Justice Carr concluded that Trombley\u2019s mental condition was not the result of a physical injury sustained in the course of employment, as the evidence showed planning, not an act committed in an emotional or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>insane frenzy or in obedience to an irresistible or uncontrollable impulse. <em>Id., </em>pp 658, 660, 661.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">The city asserts that the WCAB applied still a third test, the \"honest, though mistaken, perception\u201d test stated in <em>Deziel v Difco Laboratories, Inc, supra,</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and notes that the Court of Appeals, after decision by the WCAB in the instant case, adopted the <em>Deziel </em>test in another case. <em>Lopucki v Ford Motor Co, </em>109 Mich App 231, 235; 311 NW2d 338 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">We agree with the city that the chain-of-causation test is the correct test, but are satisfied that the WCAB applied that test and not the <em>Deziel </em>test.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">The first inquiry is whether the worker who committed suicide received \"a personal injury arising out of and in the course of employment.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The second inquiry, the <em>Sponatski-Trombley </em>question, is whether there is an adequate causal nexus between the work-related injury and the suicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-9\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b161-10\">We first consider whether Hammons received \"a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>personal injury arising out of and in the course of employment.\u201d Justice Souris observed in <em>Trombley </em>that this Court had \"held that compensation benefits are payable for incapacity to work because of a claimant\u2019s mental disorder arising out of and in the course of his employment, whether or not such mental disorder results from a direct physical blow to claimant\u2019s body.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> That construction of the act is now well established.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">The finding of the WCAB that Hammons had suffered a \"profound emotional disorder\u201d which led him to commit suicide supports the implicit finding of the WCAB that Hammons received a \"personal injury.\u201d The further finding that this injury arose out of and in the course of the employment acknowledged that both work-related <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>and non-work-related<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> factors led to Hammons\u2019 emotional disorder. Both Deziel<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and <em>Kepsel,</em><footnotemark><em>13</em></footnotemark><em> </em>relied on by the WCAB, together with other authorities,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> fully support the conclusion of the WCAB <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>that \"[t]he existence of those non-work-related difficulties does not negate the compensability of the work-related factors.\u201d The WCAB\u2019s conclusion that Hammons suffered a personal injury in the form of mental illness arising out of and in the course of the employment appears to have been reached by analysis conforming to the applicable rules of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">We turn to the second inquiry, the adequacy of the causal nexus between the work-related injury and the suicide. In <em>Sponatski', supra, </em>the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts affirmed an award of compensation based on a finding by the administrative tribunal that the worker, while insane as a result of his injury and acting from an uncontrollable impulse, threw himself from a window and was fatally injured. Although not necessary to decision, the Court stated in dictum a rule that came to be adopted in a majority of jurisdictions.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The Court said that where, as in the case before the Court, \"there follows as the direct result of a physical injury an insanity of such violence as to cause the victim to take his own life through an uncontrollable impulse or in a delirium of frenzy 'without conscious volition to produce death, having knowledge of the physical nature and consequences of the act,\u2019 then there is a direct and unbroken causal connection between the physical injury and the death. But where the resulting insanity is such as to cause suicide through a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>voluntary wilful choice determined by a moderately intelligent mental power which knows the purpose and the physical effect of the suicide act even though the choice is dominated and ruled by a disordered mind, then there is a new and independent agency which breaks the chain of causation arising from the injury.\u201d <em>Sponatski, supra, </em>p 530.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\">The <em>Sponatski </em>formulation requires a mental illness of such severity as to cause the victim to take his own life through an uncontrollable impulse or in a delirium of frenzy without conscious volition.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In <em>Trombley, supra, </em>Justice Souris and two other justices were of the opinion that although the workers\u2019 compensation benefits awarded to Trombley\u2019s widow could be affirmed in the application of the <em>Sponatski </em>voluntary-wilful choice test or the chain-of-causation test, the <em>Sponatski </em>test should be rejected.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>We agree with Justice Souris, the city, Professor Larson,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and commentators generally,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> who have urged the adoption of the chain-of-causation test, that the questions of causation or intervening causation and intention should not turn on whether the worker knows what he is doing. A mind disoriented by physical or mental pain may be so impaired in its reasoning capacity that, although aware of the choices, it is incapable of rational choice.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b167-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>The requisite causal connection between a work-related injury and death is not broken by an act that is the product of work-related mental injury and resulting impaired capacity for rational decision and choice. The impairment in the capacity for rational decision-making and an act of suicide resulting from such impairment are consequences of the mental injury and not separate or intervening causes. If the work results in mental injury and the mental injury results in suicide, the suicide is compensable.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\">The WCAB found that Hammons\u2019 profound emotional disorder \"led to his suicide.\u201d It spoke of \"decedent\u2019s extreme depression and resultant suicide.\u201d It said that the work-related and non-work-related problems combined to \"produce decedent\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>illness and death.\u201d The findings appear to be straightforward applications of the chain-of-causation test, and, again, were in conformity with the applicable rules of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">In Lopucki, <em>supra, </em>pp 235-236, the Court of Appeals adopted a <em>Deziel </em>analysis for suicide cases:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-8\">\"We require a different approach. Due to the Michigan Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Deziel v Difco Laboratories, Inc, </em>403 Mich 1; 268 NW2d 1 (1978), the theory of an intervening intermediate cause of the suicide is not a viable theory in Michigan. Such theory assumes the existence of a rational part of the brain which chooses suicide despite the survival instinct and this rational portion of the brain is the 'actual\u2019 cause of the suicide. The <em>Deziel </em>decision eliminated the requirement of showing any 'actual\u2019 causal nexus between the employment and the injury. It is now sufficient if a strictly subjective causal nexus is supplied. If it is factually established that a claimant honestly, though mistakenly, perceived some personal injury incurred during his employment caused his disability, then he is entitled to compensation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b168-9\">In neither <em>Lopucki </em>nor the instant case was there a finding that the worker\u2019s mental illness or suicide was caused by his non-work-related problems although he \"honestly believed\u201d that his work-related problems were the cause of his mental illness. Since compensation was neither sought nor awarded on the basis of \"honest perception\u201d and the WCAB could not have been guided by <em>Lopucki, </em>which was decided after the instant case was decided, we see no reason to remand for further factfinding out of concern that the departures from the chain-of-causation test in <em>Lopucki </em>may have occasioned the award in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>The citation of <em>Deziel </em>by the WCAB in the instant case appears, in context, to relate to the portion of <em>Deziel </em>recognizing the difficulty in determining \"the causal significance of any one factor,\u201d and that nevertheless compensation may be awarded if there is a work-related factor.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">In <em>Selk v Detroit Plastic Products (On Resubmission), </em>419 Mich 32; 348 NW2d 652 (1984), this Court held'that the increase in the interest rate effected by 1981 PA 194<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> from 5% to 12% per annum is retroactive to the date each weekly payment of workers\u2019 compensation benefits was due if the compensation is paid after January 1, 1982, pursuant to an award of a hearing referee, the WCAB,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> or a court.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">Affirmed, and remanded to the WCAB for the computation of interest.</p>\n<judges id=\"b169-7\">Williams, C.J., and Kavanagh and Cavanagh, JJ., concurred with Levin, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b156-9\"> The WCAB said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-10\">\"Decedent took a promotional exam in 1972 and was at the top of the list when he was sent to Command Supervisors School in early 1974. It was understood that this training was undergone in anticipation of and preparation for an appointment to the next sergeant vacancy. When the City of Highland Park decided to eliminate several sergeant posts, the Highland Park Police Officers\u2019 Association filed suit. One week before his death, decedent learned that that complaint had been dropped and that his chances for future promotion were considerably reduced.\u201d <em>Hammons v Highland Park Police Dep\u2019t, </em>unpublished opinion of the WCAB, filed April 22, 1981.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b158-6\"> The brief of the city recounts the testimony that would support the conclusion that Hammons\u2019 depression and mental problems were attributable to factors other than work:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-7\">\"Mr. Hammons\u2019 childhood was plagued with family problems. He was raised without the benefit of a father. His father had died six months before his birth. His mother remarried, but her second marriage ended in divorce. Furthermore, decedent and his mother had a strained, distant relationship.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-8\">\"Perhaps for these reasons, the decedent was very devoted to and 'caught up\u2019 in his own family. He was unhappy with his son John\u2019s irresponsibility. He wanted to move his family from Highland Park because he feared his daughters would begin interracial dating, which he abhorred. The Hammons, however, were financially unable to move. In fact, the Hammons were in constant financial difficulty, as the decedent was apt to live beyond his means.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-9\">\"In 1968, one of decedent\u2019s daughters, Pammy, died in a tragic auto accident. She was returning to school at lunchtime when an automobile ran a red light. The car, out of control, drove over the curb, knocked over a safety-boy and crossing-lady, and dragged Pammy across the street. The car eventually pinned the girl against a tree. She lived for 5-1/2 hours, but never regained consciousness. Immediately after the accident, the decedent was deeply disturbed. He had to be helped to his room by his fellow police officers and put to bed. His wife called a doctor who sedated Mr. Hammons by means of an injection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-10\">\"Decedent was not able to make arrangements for his daughter\u2019s funeral. Mrs. Hammons recalled that Mr. Hammons would lie on the couch with his deceased daughter\u2019s paper-mache, angel-doll and with her Girl Scout uniform over his arm. Two or three days before his daughter\u2019s death, Pammy had asked the decedent if she could play with his transistor radio, but Mr. Hammons did not permit her to do so. After Pammy\u2019s death, Mr. Hammons spoke of his refusal to let her play with the radio a great deal. In fact, he had the radio buried with his child. He also requested that his daughter be buried in her Girl Scout uniform. At the wake, decedent held the angel-doll as if he was transfixed in another place. He continued for some time after the funeral in this manner. He would go for long walks in the rain and disappear for periods of time. He would walk back to the park where he played with his deceased daughter and carry mementos of his daughter with him. Mrs. Hammons requested that the decedent\u2019s fellow officers take away decedent\u2019s firearms because the decedent was unstable and she did not trust him in the house. The decedent\u2019s hunting revolvers and pistols were locked up, pursuant to her instruc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>tions. Decedent\u2019s partner at work, John Holloway, thought that Mr. Hammons would Tose it\u2019 at this time. He believed that Mr. Hammons\u2019 deep depression would cause him to lose his mental stability and capacity to operate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-7\">\"Before his daughter\u2019s death, the deceased was described as an easy-going, happy-go-lucky person. After her death, he nearly had a nervous breakdown and became tense and short-tempered. The decedent had never been under a doctor\u2019s care before the incident, but thereafter began treating <em>[sic] </em>for nervous and emotional problems. Mrs. Hammons recalled that Mr. Hammons completely lost interest in living about this time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-8\">\"In addition to this calamity, Mr. Hammons\u2019 marriage deteriorated. After Pammy\u2019s death, Mrs. Hammons had a hysterectomy. Mr. and Mrs. Hammons ceased having sexual relations with one another. By late 1973, it became clear that their personal problems would lead to divorce. The decedent moved into the attic of the marital home. Mrs. Hammons testified that the tension was building in early 1974 to where she was afraid of <em>[sic] </em>her own life. She described the situation as 'like sitting on a powder keg\u2019. At one point, the decedent almost choked his wife to death. The decedent was eventually forced via court order to move from the attic of the marital home. At this time, decedent was losing weight, dyeing his hair, and wearing flashy clothes. The Hammons\u2019 ensuing divorce was long and bitter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-9\">\"Following his June 21, 1974 divorce, the decedent became romantically involved with a co-employee, Gloria Strongman, at the hospital where he worked. The decedent was very eager to re-marry after his divorce. He purchased an engagement ring for Ms. Strongman at Christmas time, just days before his death. Ms. Strongman rejected his offer of marriage, however, 1-1/2 days before his death. Richard Grimm, a co-employee of decedent, consoled the decedent by saying he and Ms. Strongman should not get married because they were both divorced and had the same problems.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b159-10\"> The WCAB cited MCL 418.331(1)(b); MSA 17.237(331)(1)(b) and MCL 418.341; MSA 17.237(341).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b159-11\"> Benefits were awarded from the date of death and until the further order of the board, not to exceed 500 weeks.

Under a 'strictly <em>subjective </em>causal nexus\u2019 standard, a claimant is entitled to compensation if it is factually established that claimant <em>honestly perceives </em>some personal injury incurred during the ordinary work of his employment 'caused\u2019 his disability.

The correct statement is that the suicide must be the result of some injury arising out of and in the course of employment. In other words, it should not be necessary to show that the first injury resulted in the kind of disability that would in itself have technically entitled the claimant to compensation. For example, in <em>Wilder v Russell Library Company, </em>[107 Conn 56; 139 A 644; 56 ALR 455 (1927)], a librarian suffered a physical and nervous breakdown due to overwork and worry and committed suicide when her condition developed into insanity. Although there was a history of predisposition to mental trouble in her family, compensation was awarded on the ground that the suicide was the direct result of the employment. Similarly, in <em>Trombley v State of Michigan, </em>an employee of the Coldwater State Home and Training School had been questioned by a legislative committee which was investigating the death of a patient at the Home. He heard on the evening news broadcast that the committee was preparing to continue the investigation. Up to that time, the employee 'had felt aggrieved\u2019 by the accusations made against him, but merely 'threw up his hands and went to bed\u2019 on hearing the latest news.

His analysis considers the major objections to <em>Sponatski </em>expressed by legal scholars and other courts, objections which I believe are valid and require our rejection of its rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-7\">\" 'Although the test formulated in the <em>Sponatski Case </em>has been followed in a number of other jurisdictions (see cases collected 143 ALR 1227 and 56 ALR 459), it has certain rather clear deficiencies. It seems to assume that a man\u2019s capacity to choose is a constant, unvariable factor, unaffected by whatever stresses may be brought to bear against it, and so it minimizes to the point of exclusion the possibility that capacity to choose may itself be impaired as the result of a compensable injury. If any degree of choice or volition remains, recovery is to be barred \"even though choice is dominated and ruled by a disordered mind,\u201d \u2014 which by hypothesis means a mind that has become disordered as the result of the injury for which compensation is sought. To us this underlying assumption of the <em>Sponatski </em>test is dubious, both from a medical and from a legal point of view. Neither the record before us, the briefs of the parties, nor the opinions that have adopted the <em>Sponatski </em>test suggest that its basic assumption rests upon responsible medical opinion. And so far as the law is concerned, it regularly recognizes, in a multitude of situations subsumed under the concept of duress, that freedom of choice may be so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>impaired by extrinsic pressures, physical and mental, as to deprive conduct of its normal legal significance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-7\">\" 'The <em>Sponatski </em>test has been vigorously criticized for its failure to recognize the role which pain or despair may play in breaking down a rational mental process.

It has been pointed out that the rule that there can be no recovery unless the suicide occurs \"through an uncontrollable impulse or in a delirium of frenzy without conscious volition to produce death,\u201d practically excludes from compensation those cases not marked by some violent or eccentric method of self-destruction. (1 Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law [1952], \u00a7 36.20.) And it has been stated that it is erroneous as a matter of law to characterize a suicide as an intervening cause when it is attributable to a psychosis that results from a compensable injury. \"The slashing of the wrist was an intervening act, but not an intervening cause.

The term \"misconduct\u201d suggests culpability or wrongdoing. The actions of a person whose mind is impaired by a profound emotional disorder and extreme depression are not the product of a free will, of unfettered choice, and hence are not voluntary or intentional in the sense that the term \"intentional and wilful misconduct\u201d is used in the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">Professor Larson has written:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-9\">\"The modern rule is that violation of a statute is not wilful misconduct <em>per se. </em>There must be the intentional doing of something of a quasi-criminal nature, either with knowledge that it is likely to result in serious injury, or with a wanton disregard of probable consequences.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-10\">\"A striking illustration of the relation between the statutory offense and the compensation defense is afforded by the decision in <em>Day v Gold Star Dairy </em>[307 Mich 383; 12 NW2d 25 (1943)], in which the claimant, having been involved in a collision resulting from his attempt to pass a truck at the crest of a' hill on a wet day, was convicted of reckless driving by a jury. Nevertheless, his award of compensation was affirmed under the Michigan statute making wilful and intentional misconduct a defense.

This test is described in <em>Trombley v Coldwater State Home &amp; Training School, </em>366 Mich 649, 664; 115 NW2d 561 (1962), as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-6\">\"Some few American courts, Florida, California, New York, Mississippi, and recently Illinois, follow a rule which, generally speaking, allows compensation upon a showing of causal connection between the decedent\u2019s employment, his injury or mental disorder and his suicide. This approach regards such suicide as a compensable consequence of a work-connected injury or mental disorder, not as an intervening cause of death. It also obviates the necessity for assessing the 'precise quality\u2019 ... of the decedent\u2019s mental condition at the moment of suicide to the extent required by <em>Sponatski </em>[220 Mass 526; 108 NE 466 (1915)]. In those States, like Michigan, which have statutory provisions barring recovery of compensation if injury or death results from intentional or wilful action by the decedent employee, the decedent\u2019s mental derangement need only be found to have <em>so impaired his reasoning faculties that his act of suicide was not voluntary in the sense that term is used to describe rational choice of alternatives.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added, citations and footnotes omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">The proper application of this test requires the WCAB to make explicit factual findings regarding the causal link between the employment and the injury, and between the injury and the act of suicide. Compare <em>Reynolds Metals Co v Industrial Comm, </em>119 Ariz 566; 582 P2d 656 (1978). In order to establish this latter nexus, it must be shown that Hammons\u2019 mental injury was of such a quality as to have so impaired his reasoning faculties that his act of suicide was not the product of a rational mind. See <em>Trombley, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">Although, perhaps, the WCAB\u2019s opinion can be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>read, as the majority has done, as containing an \"implicit finding\u201d that Hammons suffered a personal injury in the course of his employment, it <em>does not </em>contain any indication that the WCAB examined the relationship between Hammons\u2019 injury and his act of suicide. The opinion indicates that the WCAB merely <em>assumed </em>a causal link between the injury and the act of suicide. Since the test articulated by the majority did not exist as a part of Michigan workers\u2019 compensation law until today, it is not particularly surprising that the WCAB\u2019s opinion does not comport with the test which the majority has announced.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">Because the WCAB has not made a factual finding regarding whether or not Hammons\u2019 injury was of such a quality as to have rendered him incapable of rational choice, we would remand this case to the WCAB in order to permit that body to carry out its fact-finding function.</p>\n<judges id=\"b171-6\">Brickley and Boyle, JJ., concurred with Ryan, J.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
