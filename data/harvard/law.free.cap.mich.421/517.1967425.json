They pay property taxes to the district for school operating purposes. In the 1981-1982 school year, plaintiffs enrolled their daughter Brenda as a full-time sixth grade student in the Charlotte Christian Academy, a private nondenominational school.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-11\">Since the academy does not offer a band course, plaintiffs attempted to enroll Brenda in the sixth grade band course offered in defendant\u2019s public schools. Brenda has her own musical instrument and plaintiffs are willing to transport her to and from class. Brenda would attend band at the time and place which this course is provided to full-time public school students. Defendant admits that there is room in the class for Brenda and that it would receive state school aid for her part-time attendance. Nevertheless, defendant refused to permit her enrollment because it does not offer any shared time courses or permit dual enrollment. Its policy is to limit enrollment in all classes to full-time students only. However, defendant allows its public school students to attend classes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>at local community colleges during the school day for credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-4\">Plaintiffs filed suit to compel defendant school district to enroll Brenda in the band class. They argued that Brenda\u2019s exclusion violated her statutory right to attend public school in the school district in which she resides. MCL 380.1147; MSA 15.41147. In addition, defendant\u2019s policy allegedly violated plaintiffs\u2019 First Amendment right to freely exercise their religious beliefs and their Fourteenth Amendment right to equal protection under the law. Following a bench trial, the circuit court ruled that Michigan public school systems are not required to offer shared time instruction and that plaintiffs\u2019 First and Fourteenth Amendment rights had not been violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">Plaintiffs appealed, and the Attorney General was allowed to intervene in their behalf. The Court of Appeals affirmed, over a lengthy dissent. <em>Snyder v Charlotte Public School </em>Dist, 123 Mich App 56; 333 NW2d 542 (1983). This Court granted plaintiffs\u2019 and the Attorney General\u2019s application for leave to appeal. 417 Mich 1041 (1983). The Michigan Education Association, Michigan Federation of Teachers, Michigan Association of School Boards, and Michigan Association of Nonpublic Schools have filed amici curiae briefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">\"Shared time\u201d instruction was aptly described in <em>Traverse City School Dist v Attorney </em>General,. 384 Mich 390, 411, fn 3; 185 NW2d 9 (1971):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-8\">\" 'As generally used in current literature in the field of education, the term \"shared time\u201d means an arrangement for pupils enrolled in nonpublic elementary or secondary schools to attend public schools for in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>struction in certain subjects .... The shared time provision is or would be for public school instruction for parochial school pupils in subjects widely (but not universally) regarded as being mainly or entirely secular, such as laboratory science and home economics.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-6\">\"As this quotation indicates, shared time is an operation whereby the public school district makes available courses in its general curriculum to both public and nonpublic school students normally on the premises of the public school.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">There are three significant differences between shared time and direct financial aid to nonpublic schools (also known as parochiaid):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-8\">\"First, under parochiaid the public funds are paid to a private agency whereas under shared time they are paid to a public agency. Second, parochiaid permitted the private school to choose and to control a lay teacher whereas under shared time the public school district chooses and controls the teacher. Thirdly, parochiaid permitted the private school to choose the subjects to be taught, so long as they are secular, whereas shared time means the public school system prescribes the public school subjects. These differences in control are legally significant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-9\">\"Obviously, a shared time program offered on the premises of the public school is under the complete control of the public school district . . . .\u201d <em>Id., </em>pp 413-414.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b676-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b676-11\">Plaintiffs arpie that MCL 380.1147; MSA 15.41147 establishes the statutory right of school-age children to attend public schools in the district in which they reside. The Legislature has not conditioned (or authorized local boards of education to condition) this right upon full-time attendance. Plaintiffs conclude that Brenda must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>allowed to attend all or part of the public school program. They criticize the Court of Appeals majority for limiting this statutory right because of the speculative potential for excessive entanglement of church and state which shared time allegedly presents.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-4\">Defendant responds by citing numerous statutory provisions which authorize local boards of education to set curriculum and determine the operating policies of public school districts. Courts may not disturb a board\u2019s policy decision unless it is arbitrary and unreasonable. Defendant maintains that it has adequately justified its full-time enrollment policy. Defendant asserts that part-time students would dilute the school program for full-time students and take a disproportionate amount of scarce resources; full-time attendance in a single school is administratively and educationally advantageous; part-time admission would cause an overall decline in full-time enrollment, resulting in decreased state aid; and extensive coordination between public and private schools would be required.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">Although public education is not a fundamental right granted by the federal constitution, it is not merely some governmental benefit which is indistinguishable from other forms of social welfare legislation. <em>Plyler v Doe, </em>457 US 202, 221; 102 S Ct 2382; 72 L Ed 2d 786 (1982).

(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b679-4\">The prior school codes contained substantially similar language.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> These earlier provisions have been interpreted to prevent a school board from excluding any resident because of race, color, or religious beliefs and to provide an equal right to all schools, irrespective of such distinctions. <em>People ex rel Workman v Detroit Bd of Ed, </em>18 Mich 400, 410 (1869). The 1976 code was primarily intended to be a recodification of existing law.

The child\u2019s attendance shall be continuous and consecutive for the school year fixed by the school district in which the child is enrolled. In a school district which maintains school during the entire calendar year and in which the school year is divided into quarters, a child shall not be compelled to attend the public school more than 3 quarters in 1 calendar year, but a child shall not be absent for 2 consecutive quarters.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-7\">\"(3) A child shall not be required to attend the public schools in the following cases:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>\"(a) A child who is attending regularly and is being taught in a state approved nonpublic school, which teaches subjects comparable to those taught in the public schools to children of corresponding age and grade, as determined by the course of study for the public schools of the district within which the nonpublic school is located.\u201d MCL 380.1561; MSA 15.41561.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">Section 1561(3)(a) recognizes the constitutional right of parents to send their children to either public or private schools. See <em>Pierce v Society of Sisters, </em>268 US 510; 45 S Ct 571; 69 L Ed 1070 (1925).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">General supervision over public education is vested in the State Board of Education. Const 1963, art 8, \u00a7 3. The state may establish school curricula either by statute or by delegating its authority to local school boards. <em>Mercer v Michigan State Bd of Ed, </em>379 F Supp 580, 585 (ED Mich, 1974), <em>aff'd </em>419 US 1081; 95 S Ct 673; 42 L Ed 2d 678 (1974). Local school districts and officers, however, possess only those powers which statutes expressly, or by reasonably necessary implication, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>grant to them. <em>Senghas v L\u2019Anse Creuse Public Schools, </em>368 Mich 557, 560; 118 NW2d 975 (1962); <em>Jacox v Bd of Ed of Van Buren Consolidated School Dist, </em>293 Mich 126, 128; 291 NW2d 247 (1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">Sections 1282 and 1300 of the School Code set forth some of those duties and powers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-6\">\"The board of a school district shall establish and carry on the grades, schools, and departments it deems necessary or desirable for the maintenance and improvement of the schools, determine the courses of study to be pursued, and cause the pupils attending school in the district to be taught in the schools or departments the board deems expedient.\u201d MCL 380.1282; MSA 15.41282.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-7\">\"The board of a school district shall make reasonable regulations relative to anything necessary for the proper establishment, maintenance, management, and carrying on of the public schools of the district, including regulations relative to the conduct of pupils concerning their safety while in attendance at school or enroute to and from school.\u201d MCL 380.1300; MSA 15.41300.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b681-8\">A school board\u2019s authority to offer shared time instruction is derived in particular from \u00a7 1282. See <em>Traverse City, supra, </em>384 Mich 411, fn 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-9\">In reviewing a school board\u2019s decision, a court cannot substitute its judgment for that of the board. Its inquiry is limited to whether the board\u2019s actions were arbitrary and unreasonable. The actions are presumed to be reasonable and proper unless there is a clear showing of abuse. <em>Hiers v Detroit Superintendent of Schools, </em>376 Mich 225, 234-235; 136 NW2d 10 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-10\">There is no legislation which specifically requires or limits shared time courses or dual enroll-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>merit.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Nevertheless, shared time has been an accepted method of education in this state for over 60 years. <em>Traverse City, supra, </em>p 407, fn 2. The Legislature has acknowledged shared time instruction in the State School Aid Act of 1979<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> by authorizing aid to school districts for nonpublic school children who attend public schools part-time. See MCL 388.1606, 388.1711; MSA 15.1919(906), 15.1919(1011); 1979 AC, R 340.6(b), 1984 AACS, R 340.7(2). See also <em>Morton v Chicago Bd of Ed, </em>69 Ill App 2d 38, 49; 216 NE2d 305 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">In addition, the Legislature has not required attendance in either a public or private school for the entire school day.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In fact, public school students are allowed to attend religious instruction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>classes away from the public school during the school day for up to two class hours per week. MCL 380.1561(3)(e); MSA 15.41561(3)(e). (This is traditionally referred to as \"released time.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">In <em>Traverse City, </em>this Court ruled on the constitutionality of Proposal C, the amendment to Const 1963, art 8, \u00a7 2, which was ratified in the 1970 referendum. This \"anti-parochiaid\u201d amendment prohibited the direct or indirect use of public funds to aid or maintain a nonpublic school:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-7\">\"No public monies or property shall be appropriated or paid or any public credit utilized, by the legislature or any other political subdivision or agency of the state directly or indirectly to aid or maintain any private, denominational or other nonpublic, preelementary, elementary, or secondary school. No payment, credit, tax benefit, exemption or deductions, tuition voucher, subsidy, grant or loan of public monies or property shall be provided, directly or indirectly, to support the attendance of any student or the employment of any person at any such nonpublic school <em>or at any location or institution where instruction is offered in whole or in part to such nonpublic school students. </em>The legislature may provide for the transportation of students to and from any school.\u201d (Emphasis added.)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b683-8\">The Attorney General construed Proposal C to prohibit shared time instruction at public schools. OAG 1969-1970, No 4715, p 183 (November 3, 1970). In an opinion written by Justice Williams, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>this Court found this to be \"a shocking result\u201d and struck down the above-emphasized language. <em>Traverse City, supra, </em>p 412. In a footnote, the Court stated that the question presented was \"whether in certain situations state aid to nonpublic schools or their pupils is <em>mandatory \u201d Id., </em>p 431, fn 19. After concluding that banning shared time instruction would violate the federal Equal Protection and Free Exercise Clauses, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-6\">\"This does not mean that a public school district must offer shared time instruction or auxiliary services; it means that if it does offer them to public school children at the public school, nonpublic school students also have a right to receive them at the public school.\u201d <em>Id., </em>p 433.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">The parties argue over the meaning of this language. Plaintiffs interpret it to mean that a school board need not offer a particular class, but, once it decides to do so, nonpublic school children have the right to attend. Defendant argues that the <em>Traverse City </em>Court did not impose mandatory-shared time instruction for every class offered in the district. If the district decides to offer a class on a shared time basis, then all nonpublic school children have the right to attend regardless of their religious affiliation.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b685-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>Justice Adams\u2019 partial concurrence in <em>Traverse City </em>shows that plaintiffs\u2019 interpretation is correct:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-5\">\"I agree with Justice Williams that Proposal C does not prohibit shared-time instruction for private school students in the public schools.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-6\">\"[Programs offered in the public school [must] be made available to all students, whether from public or private schools, on an equal basis.\u201d <em>Id., </em>pp 439-440.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">Plaintiffs also persuasively argue that if Michigan voters could not prohibit shared time statewide by Proposal C, a local school board should not be able to do so in their district by a full-time enrollment policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-8\">Note, however, that the parties in <em>Traverse City </em>did not raise a statutory argument for or against shared time instruction. The decision was based entirely on federal constitutional law. Although <em>Traverse City </em>supports plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional arguments, we prefer to base our decision on \u00a7 1147 of the School Code, since it is well established that this Court will decline to address federal constitutional issues if state statutory relief is available.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-9\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b685-10\">Under \u00a7 1147, public schools are open to all residents of the school district who are at least five years old. This statutory right to public education is not conditioned upon full-time attendance. As previously noted, public school students may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>excused for up to two hours per week for religious instruction. Defendant school district allows its high school students to attend community college classes during the school day for high school credit. Many public schools also have work-study programs and educational arrangements with vocational and artistic institutions. Such practices acknowledge the possibility that a child may receive his or her education from more than one institution.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">Defendant school district argues that \u00a7 1282 and \u00a7 1300 of the School Code allow it to determine public school curriculum and operating policies. This power allegedly includes the ability to limit enrollment in classes to full-time public school students. This argument necessarily implies that \u00a7 1282 and \u00a7 1300 supersede a child\u2019s \u00a7 1147 right to attend public school. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">School boards were created for the purpose of organizing, maintaining, and locating schools for the education of all resident school-age children. If part-time instruction would tend to disorganize the school and handicap the school authorities in maintaining the school, then full-time attendance could be required. A school board\u2019s belief that part-time attendance would be detrimental is entitled to consideration and respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">However, there is no basis for such a conclusion on this record. Arrangements could easily be made to limit disorganization and inconvenience. It would be just as easy, economical, and convenient (if not more so) to open these classes to nonpublic school students as it would be to provide these classes to them if they became full-time public school students. The administrative difficulties are minimal and Brenda\u2019s attendance (as well as other nonpublic school students\u2019 attendance) would ordinarily not be disruptive.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>Defendant allows its older students to attend community college classes part-time during the school day. Problems concerning transportation, grading, and coordination of classes have obviously been solved. Other school districts in this state have successfully offered shared time courses for many years without problem. Defendant has not shown how full-time enrollment is \"educationally advantageous.\u201d It would seem that a diverse student body would result in new perspectives to problems, stimulate the educational process, and engender respect and understanding for other students\u2019 beliefs and upbringing. Part-time students would still be subject to the school board\u2019s reasonable rules and regulations, thus minimizing disruption and disorganization. Nonpublic school students presumably are as disciplined and interested in learning as their public school counterparts.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">Defendant has also not shown that the availability of shared time instruction would result in decreased full-time public school enrollment. Better education and discipline, as well as the instillation of religious and ethical ideals, are generally the reasons parents send their children to nonpublic schools, rather than the availability of shared time instruction. In fact, plaintiffs have continued to send Brenda to a nonpublic school despite the present unavailability of shared time courses because they believe that the school is a better educational and religious experience. The high cost of nonpublic school tuition is also a deciding factor for many parents. Finally, defendant admits that it would receive state school aid for part-time students.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">Case law from other jurisdictions is scarce. In <em>State ex rel School Dist of Hartington v Nebraska Bd of Ed, </em>188 Neb 1; 195 NW2d 161 (1972), <em>cert </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number><em>den </em>409 US 921; 93 S Ct 220; 34 L Ed 2d 182 (1972), the Hartington School District entered into a lease with a Catholic high school to provide instructional activities and services for educationally deprived children in two of the high school\u2019s classrooms. The classes were to be conducted and funded pursuant to the Federal Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. The school district was to have full control over the classrooms and educational program and no religious objects were to be displayed. The program and lease were upheld against state and federal constitutional challenges raised by the state board of education.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">The constitutionality of allowing parochial school children to participate in the educational program was also raised. Federal law and regulations required that educationally deprived private school children within the public school district be allowed to participate in programs comparable to those provided to public school children. The Nebraska Supreme Court wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-7\">\"The Constitution of Nebraska specifically provides that no religious test or qualification shall be required of any student for admission to any public school. Art VII, \u00a7 11, Constitution of Nebraska. It would seem that an attempt to prohibit a student enrolled in a parochial school from participating in a program conducted by the public schools, solely because the student was enrolled in a parochial school, would violate this provision of the Constitution of Nebraska.\u201d <em>Hartington, supra, </em>p 4.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b688-8\">The <em>Hartington </em>court also found that this \"aid\u201d was directed to nonpublic school children and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>therefore did not violate the federal Establishment Clause. <em>Id., </em>p 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-4\">The Michigan Constitution does not contain a provision identical to Art VII, \u00a7 11 of the Nebraska Constitution. However, Const 1963, art 8, \u00a72, which requires a school district to provide education without religious discrimination, can be interpreted in a similar manner.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">We recognize that a contrary conclusion was reached in <em>Thomas v Allegheny County Bd of Ed, </em>51 Md App 312; 443 A2d 622 (1982). There, plaintiffs were private school students who had participated in an all-county music program offered by the public school board. In 1980, the board limited participation to those students enrolled in the public schools. Plaintiffs raised arguments identical to those raised here. The Maryland Court of Appeals addressed the constitutional arguments first and concluded that plaintiffs\u2019 rights under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>Free Exercise and Equal Protection Clauses had not been violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">The <em>Thomas </em>court then analyzed \u00a7 7-101(a) of the education code, which provided that all individuals who are five years old and under twenty-one shall be admitted free of charge to Maryland public schools. Plaintiffs argued that since they were county residents and within the specified age limits, they were entitled to be admitted to the public schools or any portion thereof. The court refused to adopt such a \"strained construction\u201d of the statute. It was noted that under \u00a7 4-107, the board of education was authorized to maintain a reasonably uniform system of public schools and to determine the educational policies of the county school system. The <em>Thomas </em>court admitted that the administrative effect of allowing the participation of private school students in the band program appeared \"trivial.\u201d However, it was particularly worried that if plaintiffs\u2019 position were adopted, there would be an unreasonable burden on the efficient administration of the public school system. It concluded that the legislature or school board could permit shared time instruction, but the court could not mandate enrollment on the basis of a strained statutory interpretation. <em>Id., </em>pp 316-317, 319-320.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">We do not believe that our interpretation of \u00a7 1147 is strained. Allowing Brenda and other nonpublic school students to participate in public school classes will not place an unreasonable burden on the public school system. As in <em>Thomas, </em>we find the administrative details involved in shared time instruction to be trivial, especially where a statutory right to such instruction exists. Defendant readily admits that it would have to educate these same children full time if they and their parents decided to forego private school education. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>Private schools lessen the educational burdens of the public school system and substantially relieve the tax burden incident to the operation of the public schools.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">E</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">As previously noted, part-time students would be subject to the public school\u2019s reasonable rules and regulations as to conduct, attendance, homework, etc. Normally, the school board would determine the curriculum, when and where classes are to be offered and the number of students that can be accommodated. Since the school board has a duty to provide shared time instruction, this necessarily implies that it must provide \"reasonable access\u201d to the classes. This case does not present such problems \u2014 the band course is offered in the middle of the school day, defendant admits that it has room in the class for Brenda, and plaintiffs will provide Brenda\u2019s transportation to and from class.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">However, not every class offered by a public school must be made available on a shared time basis. In order to meet the compulsory attendance laws, a nonpublic school child must attend \"a state approved nonpublic school, which teaches subjects comparable to those taught in the public schools to children of corresponding age and grade . . . .\u201d MCL 380.1561(3)(a); MSA 15.41561(3)(a).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> This im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>plies that the nonpublic school must provide a \"core curriculum\u201d for its students, such as basic reading, mathematics, writing, English, etc. If shared time instruction were required for all courses, it would be possible for a nonpublic school to offer a full curriculum to its students while conducting only a small percentage of the classes at the nonpublic school. This would thwart the Legislature\u2019s requirement that nonpublic and public schools offer comparable basic education to their respective students. More importantly, if public schools can be required to satisfy in any way a <em>parochial </em>school\u2019s statutory responsibility to provide a core curriculum to its students, this might constitute impermissible direct aid to the parochial school, rather than legitimate aid to the students which incidentally benefits the parochial school. See <em>Americans United for Separation of Church &amp; State v </em>Porter, 485 F Supp 432, 437 (WD Mich, 1980), and Section III, <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">Section 1561(3)(a) does not require that the nonpublic schools offer identical courses of instruction. If this were so, shared time would not be necessary. Thus, \"nonessential elective courses,\u201d such as band, art, domestic science, shop, advanced math, and science classes, etc., need not be taught in nonpublic schools. These are the types of courses that have traditionally been offered on a shared time basis. Thus, once these types of courses are offered to public school students in the district, they must also be offered to resident nonpublic school students.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b692-8\">Defendant and amici curiae do not contend that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>teaching shared time courses at public schools violates the federal Establishment Clause. However, the Court of Appeals majority denied plaintiffs relief in part because it believed that such a violation existed. The majority stated that the trial testimony indicated that implementation of a shared time program would require extensive coordination between public and nonpublic schools. This continuing need for surveillance over the integration of public and nonpublic curricula and functions supposedly presented too great a potential for excessive entanglement. The majority concluded that Brenda\u2019s statutory right to attend courses at public schools was subject to the limitations of the First Amendment. It was also conjectured that if Brenda had a right to attend band classes, this right would extend to other classes without restriction. Such a situation would be similar to that struck down in <em>Americans United for Separation of Church &amp; State v </em>Porter, 485 F Supp 432 (WD Mich, 1980), where a parochial school was able to offer a full curriculum via shared time programs taught at the school. <em>Snyder, supra, </em>123 Mich App 66-67.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-4\">The <em>Traverse City </em>Court stated that shared time in and of itself does not create unconstitutional religious entanglements, although special circumstances might create such problems. <em>Traverse City, supra, </em>384 Mich 417. Although the Court did not engage in a formal Establishment Clause analysis, such an analysis reveals that no violation exists where shared time instruction is conducted on public school premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">The Establishment Clause of the First Amend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>ment commands that a state \"shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The Establishment Clause forbids the states and federal government from setting up a church, passing laws which aid one or all religions or prefer one religion over another, and levying a tax to support any religious activities or institutions. <em>Everson v Ewing Twp Bd of Ed, </em>330 US 1, 15-16; 67 S Ct 504; 91 L Ed 711 (1946).

In every Establishment Clause case, a court must reconcile the inescapable tension between preventing unnecessary intrusion of either the church or state into the precincts of the other and the reality that total separation is not possible. <em>Lynch v Donnelly, </em>465 US 668, 672; 104 S Ct 1355; 79 L Ed 2d 604 (1984). Indeed, total separation is not necessarily desirable. <em>Committee for Public Education &amp; Religious Liberty v Nyquist, </em>413 US 756, 760; 93 S Ct 2955; 37 L Ed 2d 948 (1973).

The underlying question is whether a particular policy which is neutrally applied to religious organizations merely accommodates religious interests or impermissibly advances them. <em>Brandon, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">The primary effect of shared time instruction is to provide secular public instruction to part-time nonpublic school students. <em>Citizens to Advance Public Education v State Superintendent of Public Instruction, </em>65 Mich App 168, 176; 237 NW2d 232 (1975), <em>lv den </em>397 Mich 854 (1976) (hereinafter <em>CAPE). </em>Shared time is merely one way to guarantee each child his or her statutory right to a public school education. This right extends to all nonpublic school children regardless of whether they are enrolled in a sectarian or secular nonpublic school. Ordinarily, benefits or assistance made available to a broad spectrum of citizens without regard to religious affiliation satisfy the \"primary effect\u201d test.

The United States Supreme Court has consistently rejected \"the recurrent argument that all aid to [sectarian <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>institutions] is forbidden because aid to one aspect of an institution frees it to spend its other resources on religious ends. <em>Committee for Public Education &amp; Religious Liberty v Regan, </em>444 US 646, 658; 100 S Ct 840; 63 L Ed 2d 94 (1980); <em>New York v Cathedral Academy, </em>434 US 125, 134; 98 S Ct 340; 54 L Ed 2d 346 (1977); <em>Roemer v Maryland Public Works Bd, </em>426 US 736, 747; 96 S Ct 2337; 49 L Ed 2d 179 (1976); <em>Hunt v McNair, </em>413 US 734, 743; 93 S Ct 2868; 37 L Ed 2d 923 (1973).

Thus, in <em>Wolman, </em>the Supreme Court upheld a program whereby speech and hearing diagnostic services were provided to nonpublic school students at nonpublic schools.

In <em>Meek, </em>the Court acknowledged the danger that publicly employed personnel who provide services analogous to those at issue here might transmit religious instruction and advance religious beliefs in their activities. But, as discussed in Part V, <em>supra, </em>the Court emphasized that this danger arose from the fact that the services were performed in the pervasively sectarian atmosphere of the church-related school. 421 US, at 371. See also <em>Lemon, </em>403 US, at 618-619. The danger existed there, not because the public employee was likely deliberately to subvert his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>task to the service of religion, but rather because the pressures of the environment might alter his behavior from its normal course. <em>So long as these types of services are offered at truly religiously neutral locations, the danger perceived in </em>Meek <em>does not arise.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-6\">\"The fact that a unit on a neutral site on occasion may serve only sectarian pupils does not provoke the same concerns that troubled the Court in <em>Meek.</em><footnotemark><em>14</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The influence on a therapist\u2019s behavior that is exerted by the fact that he serves a sectarian pupil is qualitatively different from the influence of the pervasive atmosphere of a religious institution.

Contrary to the Court of Appeals majority\u2019s view, we believe that any administrative entanglement would be minimal. Under this decision, public school boards are allowed to determine independently the courses they wish to offer and the times and places where the courses will be taught (subject to the reasonable access requirement). Local boards may also impose reasonable rules and regulations concerning prerequisite courses, student conduct, discipline, attendance, grading, class size, etc., in order to manage and improve the school. Public school instructors will teach purely secular subjects to classes composed of both public and nonpublic school students. As noted in <em>Wolman, supra, </em>there is no need to supervise public school teachers to ensure the secular content of their instruction. Although occasional communications between public and nonpublic school officials concerning the administrative details involved in shared time instruction will be necessary, such contacts do not violate the Establishment Clause. <em>Jamestown School Committee, supra, </em>699 F2d 12; <em>Harris, supra, </em>489 F Supp 1269; <em>CAPE, supra, </em>65 Mich App 179.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">The Court of Appeals majority relied upon cases which involved constitutional challenges to shared time courses offered at <em>nonpublic </em>schools.

The <em>Grand Rapids, Porter, </em>and <em>Paire </em>courts struck down the shared time programs in part because the classes were composed of only nonpublic school students who were enrolled full time in the same nonpublic school where the \"shared time\u201d courses were being taught. The \"public school\u201d teachers either formerly or presently taught in the nonpublic schools. In some cases, there was substantial evidence that the public and nonpublic school authorities carefully coordinated their curricula to prevent duplication of classes and accommodate religious services.

The issue is not whether such a program is desirable, but whether it must be offered.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-4\">The majority states that the School Code of 1976 was intended as a recodification of existing law which contained \"substantially similar language\u201d and which had been interpreted as preventing the exclusion of \"any resident because of race, color, or religious beliefs and to provide an equal right to all schools, irrespective of such distinctions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">Since that interpretation of the language of the original statute and later acts that specifically prohibited discrimination on the basis of race, color, or creed, the Constitution of 1963 elevated that protection from such discrimination. Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 2; art 8, \u00a7 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">It was, therefore, unnecessary to state such nondiscriminatory language in \u00a7 1147, and that language was later dropped. Furthermore, the plaintiff does not allege that she has been denied admission to the band course because of race, color, or creed.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">The majority, nevertheless, interprets the \"shall have a right to attend school\u201d language as having been violated by defendant\u2019s denial of plaintiff\u2019s request for selective admission even though there is no allegation that plaintiff has been treated differently from others seeking selective admission.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-8\">The question, then, is not whether the plaintiff can be denied admission as such, but whether the language of \u00a7 1147 was intended to allow a resident to select which parts of a school program he or she wishes to attend. I submit that \u00a7 1147 does not address that question.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-9\">If read literally, \u00a7 1147(1) would only extend \"a right to attend school in the district,\u201d if it was \"a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>school district not maintaining a kindergarten\u201d; and \u00a7 1147(2) would provide that in a district having a kindergarten a resident is only \"entitled to enroll in kindergarten.\u201d If it was the purpose of \u00a7 1147 to guarantee a \"right to attend school,\u201d it certainly would not have conditioned such an important right only to a district not having a kindergarten; and in a district having a kindergarten, it would not have only ensured the right to enroll in kindergarten.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">Section 1147 read in its entirety is clearly intended to deal with the beginning age of students and to distinguish the starting age as between districts that have or do not have kindergarten. An attempt to make \u00a7 1147 the basis for mandating shared time not only strains that section, but in my view, tortures it.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">Having posited a statutory right to attend school on a selective basis, the majority then holds \"not every class offered by a public school must be made available on a shared time basis,\u201d because the compulsory attendance laws imply that the nonpublic schools must provide a core curriculum. The majority, unconvincingly I think, then provides that to allow the nonpublic students to leave the private school for a core course would violate the compulsory attendance laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">Earlier in its reasoning, the majority said that \u00a7 1282 and \u00a7 1300 of the School Code allowing the defendant school district \"to determine public school curriculum and operating policies\u201d could not \"supersede a child\u2019s \u00a7 1147 right to attend public school.\u201d Having given \u00a7 1147 a preferred status over other statutes that give the defendant control over the way it offers its courses, I fail to see how the compulsory attendance law, even if it were an obstacle to taking core courses in both public and private schools, would not also be su<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>perseded by the \"child\u2019s \u00a7 1147 right to attend public school.\u201d Just because the nonpublic school must offer a core curriculum in order for its students to meet the compulsory attendance statute, it does not mean the student must take the core course at the nonpublic school. As the majority states, \"[t]his statutory right to public education is not conditioned upon full-time attendance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">Finally, the majority recognizes the several statutes that require certain public school offerings such as special education, driver training, and auxiliary services to be made available to students attending nonpublic schools. If the majority\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 1147 is correct, special legislative authorization for certain courses would have been unnecessary. The selective treatment of courses the Legislature intends to be offered to nonpublic school students on a mandatory basis is the best evidence that the Legislature did not, in \u00a7 1147 or any other statute, intend to mandate shared time beyond those subjects so designated.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">Beginning with an argument that was not raised or argued before the trial court, the majority would first take a statute that on its face distinguishes between the beginning ages of students in kindergarten and non-kindergarten districts and convert it into a \"right to attend school\u201d statute. It would then declare the \"right to attend school\u201d equivalent to the right of a student who is receiving a \"core curriculum\u201d education at a private school to selectively attend \" 'nonessential elective courses\u2019 \u201d in the public school, and in passing interpret the compulsory attendance laws to prohibit shared time for core curriculum courses. The majority, thereby, not only mandates a shared time program for all of Michigan\u2019s public school districts, but, in doing so, presumes to dictate those courses which shall or shall not be man<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>dated. I find no statutory justification for such judicial intervention in educational policy making. I would conclude as did the Court of Appeals that it has not been shown that the defendants violated the plaintiff\u2019s constitutional rights in not having a shared time program allowing her to participate in a band course on a selective basis.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>1 would affirm.</p>\n<judges id=\"b710-5\">Ryan and Boyle, JJ., concurred with Brickley, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b706-12\"> This argument was raised by the plaintiffs for the first time before the Court of Appeals.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b710-6\"> My conclusion that plaintiff is entitled to no relief is based on the statute in question and should not be construed as an endorsement of the finding of the Court of Appeals majority that there is a \"potential for excessive entanglement\u201d under the Establishment Clause in the implementation of a shared time program that would accommodate the plaintiffs\u2019 requested relief.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
