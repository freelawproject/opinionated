In addressing that question, we reaffirm that \"exemplary and punitive\u201d damages under the libel statute are purely compensatory in nature, but hold that their availability requires a showing of common-law malice. We further hold that, under proper instruction, a jury may award exemplary and punitive damages that are not duplicative of actual damages for injury to feelings. Because exemplary and punitive damages were awarded in this case in the absence of a proper malice instruction, we affirm the Court of Appeals judgment remanding for a new trial on damages, but modify that decision in accordance with the principles set forth below.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">Plaintiff Balfour Peisner, an attorney, brought this action against defendants The Detroit Free Press and its reporter Louis Heldman claiming actual and punitive damages for libel arising from the publication of an article written by Heldman that appeared in the Free Press in November, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>1973.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Following two pretrial appeals to the Court of Appeals on issues not relevant here,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the case was tried before a jury and a verdict returned against Heldman and the Free Press jointly in the amount of $52,000 actual damages and against the Free Press alone for $100,000 \"additional\u201d damages.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Free Press\u2019 motion for a new trial and remittitur was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">On appeal, the Court of Appeals rejected the Free Press\u2019 arguments relative to liability, but remanded for a new trial on damages on the basis of a finding that the damage instructions given permitted the jury to compensate Peisner twice for injury to feelings, as an element of both \"actual\u201d and \"exemplary and punitive\u201d damages. The Court found that such a double recovery of mental injury damages was \"a form of punishment which is not permitted in this state,\u201d requiring a redetermination of damages to compensate Peisner only once for injury to feelings. <em>Peisner v Detroit Free Press, Inc, </em>104 Mich App 59, 71; 304 NW2d 814 (1981). Judge V. J. Brennan concurred in a separate opinion expressing his concern with the confusion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>arising from use of the term \"punitive\u201d to describe a purely compensatory element of damages. <em>Id., </em>71-72.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">Peisner appealed to this Court, requesting, <em>inter alia, </em>that we rule true punitive (punishment-type) damages to be recoverable under the Michigan libel statute and that the Court of Appeals remand order be modified accordingly. No cross-appeal as to liability was taken by the Free Press.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">In short, we reject Peisner\u2019s invitation to depart from an established rule precluding true punishment-type damages in libel cases. We find however that common-law malice is a prerequisite \u2014 unsatisfied in this case \u2014 to recovery of \"exemplary and punitive\u201d damages for libel. We affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals, but remand for a new trial as to punitive and exemplary damages only.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">The starting point in our analysis is \u00a7 2 of the Michigan libel statute, MCL 600.2911; MSA 27A.2911, which in separate subsections provides <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>for the recovery of \"actual\u201d damages and \"exemplary and punitive\u201d damages:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-5\">\"(2)(a) Except as provided in (b), in actions based on libel or slander the plaintiff is entitled to recover only for the actual damages which he has suffered in respect to his property, business, trade, profession, occupation, or feelings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-6\">\"(b) Exemplary and punitive damages shall not be recovered in actions for libel unless the plaintiff, before instituting his action, gives notice to the defendant to publish a retraction and allows a reasonable time to do so, and proof of the publication or correction shall be admissible in evidence under a denial on the question of the good faith of the defendant, and in mitigation and reduction of exemplary or punitive damages. The retraction shall be published in the same size type, in the same editions and as far as practicable, in substantially the same position as the original libel.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">Subsection (a) defines \"actual damages\u201d to include damages suffered in respect to feelings, while subsection (b) permits recovery of \"exemplary and punitive damages\u201d provided a request for retraction is made and a reasonable time allowed for the defendant to publish the retraction. The publication of such a retraction does not preclude an award of exemplary and punitive damages, but is admissible on the question of defendant\u2019s good faith and in mitigation and reduction of such damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-8\">At first blush the use of the terms \"exemplary and punitive\u201d suggests a legislative intent to permit an award of damages \u2014 in addition to actual damages \u2014 for the purposes either of punishing <em>(i.e., </em>specifically deterring) defendant or of making an example of defendant for the benefit of other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>potential purveyors of libel <em>(i.e., </em>generally deterring). The history of that provision and the Michigan cases interpreting it, however, reveal that not to be the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-3\">Even before the original version of our libel statute was enacted, this Court had established the principle that \"vindictive or exemplary\u201d damages for libel are merely a species of \"actual\u201d <em>(i.e., </em>compensatory) damages awarded to compensate plaintiff for the increased injury to feelings directly attributable to defendant\u2019s <em>fault </em>in publishing the libel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-4\">\"It is in connection with the various degrees of blameworthiness chargeable on wrong-doers, that the discussions have arisen upon the subject of vindictive or exemplary damages, which, inasmuch as they rest upon actual fault, are by some authorities said to be designed to punish the wrong intent, while, according to others, the damages usually so called are only meant to recompense the sense of injury which is in human experience always aggravated or lessened in proportion to the degree of perversity exhibited by the offender. While the term exemplary or vindictive damages has become so fixed in the law that it may be difficult to get rid of it, yet it should not be allowed to be used so as to mislead, and we think the only proper application of damages beyond those to person, property or reputation, is to make reparation for the injury to the feelings of the person injured. This is often the greatest wrong which can be inflicted, and injur\u00e9d pride or affection may, under some circumstances, justify very heavy damages.\u201d <em>Detroit Daily Post Co v McArthur, </em>16 Mich 447, 452-453 (1868).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">See also <em>Scripps v Reilly, </em>38 Mich 10, 23-24 (1878).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">The first version of the libel statute, enacted in 1885, omitted any reference to injury to feelings as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>an element of actual damages.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Perhaps due to Justice Campbell\u2019s criticism of that omission in <em>Park v The Detroit Free Press Co, </em>72 Mich 560; 40 NW 731 (1888), the Legislature in 1895 added injury to feelings as an element of actual damages, separate from the existing provision for \"exemplary or punitive\u201d damages.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Thus, beginning with the 1895 enactment, all reenactments and compilations of the libel statute through the present-day version have provided for recovery both of actual damages \u2014 including compensation for injury to feelings \u2014 and of \"exemplary or punitive damages.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">Notwithstanding the separate treatment of \"actual\u201d injury-to-feelings damages and \"exemplary or punitive damages\u201d in the statute, this Court continued to interpret the terms \"exemplary or punitive\u201d as referring to damages intended solely to <em>compensate </em>plaintiff for the increase in injury to feelings attributable to defendant\u2019s fault (or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>malice, in the common-law sense) in publishing the libel. See, <em>e.g., Long v Tribune Printing Co, </em>107 Mich 207; 65 NW 108 (1895); <em>Boydan v Haberstumpf, </em>129 Mich 137, 140; 88 NW 386 (1901); <em>Poledna v Bendix Aviation Corp, </em>360 Mich 129, 144; 103 NW2d 789 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-3\">Because the Legislature, cognizant of this longstanding judicial gloss limiting exemplary and punitive damages to a compensatory role, has on several occasions through the years reenacted the libel statute without change, we conclude the Legislature intended that any award of \"exemplary and punitive\u201d damages comport with the established common-law gloss on those terms. Indeed, the latest reenactment of the libel provision in 1961 was accompanied by a committee comment stating that the new enactment was to be \"considered in light of the interpretation of the present statute.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See <em>Postill v Booth Newspapers, Inc, </em>118 Mich App 608, 629; 325 NW2d 511 (1982), <em>lv den </em>417 Mich 1050 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>In reaffirming that both \"actual damages\u201d for injury to feelings and \"exemplary and punitive damages\u201d are intended only to compensate, we stress that these two categories of compensation damages are independent. The difference between them was highlighted by Justice Wiest in a case involving assault damages, <em>Wise v Daniel, </em>221 Mich 229, 233-234; 190 NW 746 (1922):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-5\">\"If a cow kicks a man in the face the consequent physical hurt may equal that from a kick in the face with a hob-nailed boot, but the 'cussedness\u2019 of the cow raises no sense of outrage, while the malicious motive back of the boot kick adds materially to the victim\u2019s sense of outrage. If a man employs spite and venom in administering a physical hurt he must not expect his maliciousness to escape consideration when he is cast to make compensation for his wrong. If the defendant maliciously inflicted the injury then the jury had a right to take into consideration such fact together with all the circumstances disclosed and award such sum by way of compensation as the plaintiff ought to receive, and the defendant ought to be made to pay.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">In the libel context, actual damages for injured feelings are comparable to those attributable to the kick by the cow, <em>i.e., </em>the plaintiff is compensated for injured feelings attributable simply to the <em>fact </em>and <em>effect </em>of the libel. Exemplary and punitive damages, however, compensate for the incremental injury to feelings attributable to the sense of indignation and outrage experienced by the plaintiff due to the defendant\u2019s bad faith or ill will in publishing the <em>libel </em>\u2014 i.e., the \"malicious motive back of the boot kick.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b287-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>Thus, while both types of damages do indeed compensate for injured feelings, exemplary and punitive damages pick up where actual damages leave off by in effect compensating the plaintiff for injured feelings attributable solely to the egregiousness of defendant\u2019s conduct.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> To avoid confusing these two components of mental injury damages, thereby leaving open the possibility of double recovery for the same element, we urge that instructions be formulated to specify <em>both </em>\"actual\u201d damages for injured feelings and \"exemplary and punitive\u201d damages (for incremental injury to feel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>ings), with a direction to the jury permitting them to <em>increase </em>the actual damages award with exemplary and punitive damages only if the required elements (discussed below) are established. We suggest that development of a special verdict form directing the jury to address the discrete issues that must be resolved in cases involving such exemplary and punitive damage awards would assist both the deliberative process and the task of judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">By our ruling above, we necessarily reaffirm that exemplary and punitive damages for libel cannot be awarded in the absence of a finding that the defendant acted with common-law malice \u2014 in the sense of ill will or bad faith \u2014 in publishing the libel. This principle, most recently stated by this Court (with respect to medical malpractice) in <em>Veselenak v Smith, </em>414 Mich 567, 574-575; 327 NW2d 261 (1982), also has a long history of application in libel cases. See, <em>e.g., Orth v Featherly, </em>87 Mich 315, 321; 49 NW 640 (1891) (\"[Plaintiff] was entitled to recover punitive damages, if the facts proved establish express and wanton malice\u201d); <em>Couch v Mining Journal Co, </em>130 Mich 294, 297; 89 NW 936 (1902) (\"[Whether plaintiff] was entitled to punitory damages would depend upon whether the publication was malicious . . .\u201d); <em>Lawrence v Fox, </em>357 Mich 134, 146; 97 NW2d 719 (1959) (\"The existence of ill will or the absence of honest belief . . . may affect the measure of damages to be imposed, particularly as to punitive damages . . .\u201d). See also <em>Kewin v Massachusetts Mutual Life Ins Co, </em>409 Mich 401, 419; 295 NW2d 50 (1980). Since we define exemplary and punitive damages as compensation for injured feelings at<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>tributable solely to defendant\u2019s bad faith or ill will (i.e., common-law malice), the foregoing rule simply implements our definition of exemplary and punitive damages in the form of a requirement of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-3\">We recognize that a private defamation plaintiff must face an imposing array of barriers to recover exemplary and punitive damages. In this case, for example, plaintiffs were required to prove constitutional \"actual <em>malice\u201d </em>\u2014 i.e., knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard for the truth \u2014 simply to defeat defendants\u2019 qualified privilege to report on matters of public interest and thereby establish liability for actual damages.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Under the principles we adhere to today, an award of exemplary and punitive damages further requires the plaintiffs to prove compliance with the statute\u2019s retraction request procedure as well as defendant\u2019s common-law malice in publishing the libel. We do not find these extra burdens unreasonable, however, in light of the special significance attached to the reporting of matters in the public interest. In essence, our balance is struck to limit the reporter acting recklessly, but in good faith, to liability for actual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>damages only, while the reporter acting recklessly and in bad faith must bear the additional liability for exemplary and punitive damages.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> This scheme protects the legitimate interests of both constituencies, providing full and fair compensation to plaintiffs while avoiding unduly burdensome damage awards, save in the exceptional case where the defendant is motivated by ill will or bad faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">In the instant case, the trial judge gave the following instructions regarding the award of <em>actual </em>damages: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>any of those elements of damage which you determine that the Plaintiff is reasonably certain to sustain in the future.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>\"Now, if you decide that the Plaintiff husband is entitled to damages, it is your duty to determine the amount of money which reasonably, fairly and adequately compensates him for each of the elements of damage which you decide has resulted from the publication by the Defendant. You should include each of the following items of damage which you decide have been sustained by the Plaintiff to the present time, and they include:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-8\">\"The actual damages which the Plaintiff has suffered in respect to his property or business, trade, occupation or feelings, his mental anguish, his denial of social pleasures and enjoyment, his embarrassment, ridicule, humiliation, mortification or fear. You may also include</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>\"Now, which, if any, of those elements of damage has been proved is for you to decide. But you have to decide that based upon evidence and not upon speculation, not upon guess and not upon conjecture. The amount of money to be awarded for certain of these elements of damage \u2014 such as: mental anguish, denial of social pleasures, embarrassment, mortification and ridicule and things like that \u2014 the amount of money awarded for those elements can\u2019t be proved in a precise dollar amount. The law leaves both amounts to your sound judgment. But your verdict must be solely to compensate the Plaintiff for his damages and not to punish the Defendants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">As to <em>exemplary and punitive </em>damages, the judge further instructed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-5\">\"Now, members of the jury, the Michigan statute which I have just quoted mentions punitive damages. Now, under our law \u2014 and I want to correct any possible misimpressions \u2014 under our law the purpose of these 'punitive damages\u2019 is not to punish the Defendants] for their misdeeds. The purpose of these damages, which I prefer to refer to as additional damages rather than punitive damages, is to compensate the Plaintiffs for injuries suffered by them because of the Defendants\u2019 actions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-6\">\"I charge you, that although the focus is upon the Plaintiff\u2019s injuries, in measuring these additional and exemplary damages, the focus is on the Defendants\u2019] actions in determining if these additional damages should be awarded.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-7\">\"It has long been the position of the Courts of Michigan that the sting of libel will be much greater when the Defendants have acted with either knowledge of the falsity of the material, or with a reckless disregard for the truth. Since the injury is greater because of the Defendants\u2019] actions, the Plaintiffs are entitled to recover greater damages than the actual damages. And <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>this is what this punitive damages, which I referred to as additional damages means.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-5\">\"If you also find that the Plaintiff, Balfour Peisner, has established by a clear and convincing evidence that the Defendants published the article knowing the facts stated in it were false, or that the Defendants published the article with a reckless disregard for whether the facts stated were false or not, then you may also award him exemplary or additional damages, as I have explained them to you before. Such additional damages may be awarded only if the evidence of the known falsity or reckless disregard for the truth is clear and convincing. A simple preponderance of evidence which is sufficient in the actual damages, is not sufficient to award additional damages.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-6\">\"If you also decide that the Plaintiff, Mr. Peisner, is entitled to what I have labeled additional damages because the publishers of the \u2014 I\u2019m sorry. Because the publisher knew that the facts were false or because the article was published with a reckless disregard for the truth, then you may award additional damages to the Plaintiff Peisner, and these additional damages are allowed to compensate him because the sting of libel is much greater \u2014 it\u2019s made much greater when the Defendants have acted with knowledge of the falsity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-7\">\"You may estimate such additional damages in order to fairly compensate the Plaintiff for the purposes of such additional damages. As I said, although they\u2019re called punitive, it\u2019s not to punish the Defendants.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">We commend the trial judge\u2019s effort to adhere to our earlier cases in fashioning both sets of instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-9\">A. <em>Actual Damages </em>\u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b292-10\">Our rule confining exemplary and punitive damages to a purely compensatory role necessarily limits the permissible scope of actual damages in libel actions. This has led to understandable confu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>sion, since actual damages for injury to feelings would appear to encompass any award for \"compensatory\u201d exemplary and punitive damages. See <em>Veselenak, supra, </em>414 Mich 576-577. We avoid that overlap, however, by defining exemplary and punitive damages as compensating only the <em>incremental </em>injury to feelings attributable to defendant\u2019s malice. Thus, while in fact both \"actual\u201d and \"exemplary and punitive\u201d damages compensate the plaintiff, the latter operates to increase \"actual\u201d compensation only in cases where the defendant is proved to have acted with common-law malice towards the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-3\">The instruction on actual damages given in this case accurately sets forth the elements of actual injury to feelings as they are defined in this state; and the jury was told that additional damages were not to punish the defendant. While an instruction that limited the award of actual damages to injury arising from the fact and effect of the libel might have been more accurate, we find that the instructions properly expressed the distinction between actual and exemplary and punitive damages. The jury was admonished that the latter category must be compensatory, and we therefore find no reversible error in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\">B. <em>Exemplary and Punitive Damages</em></p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">Under our rule defining exemplary and punitive damages with reference to defendant\u2019s <em>common-law </em>malice, we find the instruction given defective. Rather than instructing the jury to find <em>common-law </em>malice (bad faith or ill will) toward the plaintiff as a prerequisite to awarding exemplary and punitive damages, the judge instructed that a finding of constitutional <em>actual </em>malice (knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard for the truth) would justify such an award. While a finding of \"actual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>malice\u201d (to establish liability) may in some instances supply the elements necessary for a finding of \"common-law malice,\u201d the lack of congruence between the two standards requires that the jury be instructed specifically on <em>common-law </em>malice \u2014 in the sense of ill will or bad faith towards the plaintiff \u2014 as a prerequisite to this increased recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">In sum, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals remanding for a new trial solely on the issue of damages, but modify that decision in accordance with the principles set forth in this opinion.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Because the jury was not properly instructed on the necessity for a finding of <em>common-law </em>malice as a prerequisite to an award of exemplary and punitive damages the issues to be tried on remand are the existence of any common-law malice on the part of either or both of the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>dants in publishing the article, and, if <em>common-law </em>malice is shown, the existence and amount of any incremental injury to feelings attributable to such malice to be compensated by exemplary and punitive damages <em>increasing </em>the award of actual damages.</p>\n<judges id=\"b295-3\">Williams, C.J., and Kavanagh, Ryan, Brickley, and Cavanagh, JJ., concurred with Boyle, J.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b295-4\">Levin, J., concurred in the result only.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b280-6\"> Peisner\u2019s wife joined in the action with a derivative claim not at issue in this appeal.

The committee comment that accompanied the reenactment offers no explanation for the change, and simply states in full:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-5\">\"This section is drawn entirely from the present statute and should therefore be considered in light of the interpretation of the present statute.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">Nor do we deem it significant that the statute uses two terms\u2014 \"exemplary\u201d and \"punitive\u201d \u2014 where one would suffice. The history of punitive damages in Michigan case law demonstrates that these and other terms denoting punitive damages were often used interchangeably or in multiple combinations. See, <em>e.g., Orth v Featherly, </em>87 Mich 315, 321; 49 NW 640 (1891):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-7\">\"Where actual malice is shown in an action for slander or libel, the jury may always give <em>punitive </em>damages .... The amount of such <em>exemplary </em>damages must rest largely in the discretion of the jury, under proper instructions from the court, dependent upon the facts of each particular case.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">See generally Wade, The Michigan Law of Damages at 27-1. Thus, while ordinarily the use of distinct terms suggests that distinct meanings are intended, in this context we find that both terms refer to the same category of damages.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b286-7\"> Our holding today does not conflict with our ruling in <em>Veselenak </em>v <em>Smith, </em>414 Mich 567, 576-577; 327 NW2d 261 (1982), that actual damages and exemplary damages in the medical malpractice context necessarily overlap:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-8\">\"These distinctions are, at least, legally unsound. Semantic niceties aside, juries are not asked to differentiate between mental states, such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>as shame, mortification, humiliation and indignity. Juries are asked to compensate mental distress and anguish, which flows' naturally from the alleged misconduct and may be described in such terms as shame, mortification, humiliation and indignity. In addition, if the plaintiff is being compensated for <em>all </em>mental distress and anguish, it matters not whether the source of the mental distress and anguish is the injury itself or the way in which the injury occurred.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">In the absence of a legislative prescription for exemplary damages, we held in <em>Veselenak </em>that compensatory-type exemplary damages are merely a component of actual damages attributable to defendant\u2019s conduct and hence should not be separately awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">In the libel context, by contrast, the Legislature has provided separately for actual damages for injury to feelings and \"exemplary and punitive\u201d damages. In keeping with the reasoning applied in <em>Veselenak, </em>we define exemplary and punitive damages in this context to be a component of compensatory damages awardable only where defendant\u2019s conduct amounts to common-law malice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b287-6\"> Although not intended as \"punishment\u201d damages, \"exemplary and punitive damages\u201d as we define them undoubtedly operate indirectly to punish. A libelous article published in good faith will not command as high a damage award as the identical article published with malicious intent, precisely because the latter will provide grounds for an award of exemplary and punitive damages. The latter defendant is therefore \"punished\u201d by a higher damage award attributable solely to ill will. We avoid characterizing the increased award as punishment, however, by requiring that such exemplary and punitive damages be measured by plaintiffs outrage rather than by defendant\u2019s maliciousness. As such, we merely compensate a libel plaintiff for <em>all </em>mental injury suffered, including that attributable to defendant\u2019s malicious intent, and therefore avoid the problems associated with an award of punishment-type libel damages under the state and federal constitutions as well as under judicial policy relating thereto. See Note, <em>The constitutionality of punitive damages in libel actions, </em>45 Fordham L R 1382 (1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b289-4\"> The Supreme Court in <em>Gertz v Robert Welch, Inc, </em>418 US 323, 347; 94 S Ct 2997; 41 L Ed 2d 789 (1974), left it for the states to define their own standards of liability in private figure defamation actions, requiring only that liability without fault not be imposed. In the wake of that decision, our courts have continued to apply the common-law rule requiring that a private defamation plaintiff prove \"malice\u201d to defeat the qualified privilege to report on matters of public interest; however, our courts have not been unanimous in determining which standard of malice \u2014 common law or constitutional \u2014 is the appropriate standard after <em>Gertz. </em>See <em>Peisner v Detroit Free Press, </em>82 Mich App 153, 163-164; 266 NW2d 693 (1978) (constitutional standard); <em>Postill v Booth Newspapers, Inc, </em>118 Mich App 608, 620; 325 NW2d 511 (1982) (common-law standard). Because this issue was not raised on appeal, we merely note our approval of the more recent pronouncements in courts applying our statute that have opted for application of the constitutional standard in this type of case. See <em>Gaynes v Allen, </em>128 Mich App 42; 339 NW2d 678 (1983); <em>Schultz v Newsweek, Inc, </em>668 F2d 911, 918 (CA 6, 1982); <em>Apostle v Booth Newspapers, Inc, </em>577 F Supp 962 (WD Mich, 1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b290-9\"> We assume without deciding that the publishing of an article with <em>knowledge </em>of falsity \u2014 establishing liability for actual damages under the constitutional \"actual malice\u201d standard \u2014 would necessarily establish bad faith, therefore proving the common-law malice required to justify an award of exemplary and punitive damages. A reporter or publisher acting with reckless disregard for the truth, however, might be held liable under the constitutional standard without necessarily incurring liability for exemplary and punitive damages because the reporter or publisher did not act in bad faith or with ill will towards the plaintiff. That the two standards are not congruent was recognized by the Supreme Court in <em>Cantrell v Forest City Publishing Co, </em>419 US 245, 251-252; 95 S Ct 465; 42 L Ed 2d 419 (1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b294-7\"> Plaintiffs also challenge the Court of Appeals finding of error with respect to Peisner\u2019s reading to the jury defendants\u2019 truth-defense pleading. The cases cited by the Court of Appeals to support the proposition that statements in pleadings are absolutely privileged address only the use of such statements as the <em>basis </em>for a libel action. See, <em>e.g., Sanders v Leeson Air Conditioning Co, </em>362 Mich 692; 108 NW2d 761 (1961). Those cases are inapposite since clearly Peisner did not base this libel action on defendants\u2019 responsive pleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">In relevant part, our libel statute, MCL 600.2911(3); MSA 27A.2911(3), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-9\">\"If the defendant in any action for slander or libel gives notice in his justification that the words spoken or published were true, this notice shall not be <em>of itself </em>proof of the malice charged in the complaint though not sustained by the evidence.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-10\">A common sense reading of this provision leads us to conclude that where the <em>only </em>evidence of malice is defendant\u2019s pleading of truth as a defense, the pleading is inadmissible. Since the Court of Appeals determined the error to be harmless due to other evidence of malice in the case, 104 Mich App 67, we find the pleading to be properly admissible as not \"of itself proof of the malice charged in the complaint though not sustained by the evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
