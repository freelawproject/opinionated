Bull\u00eds and Mills W. Barse owned the capital stock of three railroad companies, to Avit, the Allegany &amp; Kinzua Railroad Company, a corporation organized under the laws of Pennsylvania, a New York corporation of like name, and the Bradford &amp; Corydon Railroad Company, also a Pennsylvania corporation. These railroad lines Avere constructed for the purpose of reaching the timber on a large tract near <em>the </em>Allegheny river. The combined length of the railroads at that time was 16 miles, but the length contemplated, with the radiating lines completed, was 30 miles. Said Bull\u00eds and Barse also owned 30,000 acres of timber land in McKean county, Pa., and also other tracts-of timber land in that vicinity. They desired financial aid in the development of their scheme, and, on the date mentioned, entered into a written agreement Avith I. B. Newcombe &amp; Co., a firm of New York bankers, and this agreement is designated \u201cSchedule A of Exhibit <em>A.\u201d </em>By the terms of this agreement said Bull\u00eds and Barse were to execute a trust mortgage or deed to the Central Trust Company of Nbav York, as trustee, as security for first mortgage bonds to the amount of $250,000, bearing interest at 5 per cent., and payable 30 years from date. The said mortgage was to cover the properties and franchises of said railroad corporations, and also the said 30.000 acres of land. All of said property was to be under the management of -a new corporation, capitalized at $250,000. The said bankers undertook to negotiate at par $210,000 of said bonds, and to pay over the avails to said Bull\u00eds and Barse, as the railroad was completed along in sections of five miles. The new corporation was to be managed by seven directors, three of whom were to be elected by said bankers; so that Bull\u00eds and Barse were to retain a majority in the management of the company. There are various other provisions in the agreement; for instance as to an option given to the bankers to purchase all the capital stock of the corporation at affixed price, and that the real estate within the dominion of said corporation was to be \u201ccontiguous or tributary to one or the other of said several railroads, and they shall be timbered and profitable to said corporation,\u201d and that the new corporation should be organized, and the title transferred to it, and the trust instrument executed, and the bonds ready to be delivered, on or before January 1, 1890. A modification of said agreement was made by another contract entered into between the same parties on the 9th day of December, 1889. This agreement provided for the merger and consolidation of these railroads, with a capital stock of $500,000 at par value, and for the issue of a \u201cfirst mortgage or deed of trust\u201d upon all of the property of the corporation to said Central Trust Company of New York, as trustee, for $500,000, to secure gold bonds to that amount. The scheme designed by the modified agreement was the extension of the railroad-lines to <em>70 </em>miles, and the inclusion of 16,000 acres of additional timber land, thus bringing within the ownership of the new company 46.000 acres all told. By this agreement only $300,000 of the bonds issued were to. be put upon the market at once, and they were to-represent 46 miles of completed railroad. Newcombe &amp; Co. undertook to dispose at par of $260,000 of this bond issue, to be used as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1050\">*1050</page-number>the road was completed and put in operation by sections of five miles, and in the manner set out at length in the second paragraph of the agreement. The time for the consummation of the agreement, by the transfer of the title, etc., was by this contract extended to February i, 1890. Bullis and Barse were empowered to enter into a contract with the Interior Construction &amp; Improvement Company for the purpose of causing the merger and consolidation of said several railroads, and to cause the construction and completion thereof into one connected system. Two agreements were, accordingly, on the 9\u00dc1 day of December, 1899, entered into by said construction company, one with the Allegany &amp; Kinzua Railroad Company, which was owned by Bullis and Barse, and one with them individually, providing for the construction and consolidation of these railroads, and the contract outlined the manner in which the moneys arising from the bond issues were to be distributed, a large part of which was to be paid to Bullis and. Barse, and also provided for the deposit of a certain amount with the trustees named. The complaint further \u2022charges that said Bullis and Barse \u201cfalsely and fraudulently pretended and represented to said firm of I. B. Newcombe &amp; Co. that said tract of 30,000 acres to be conveyed was free and clear from all incumbrances, that all of said land was contiguous or adjacent to the line of said railroad, as the same was then constructed or surveyed and projected, and the said land was covered by a large quantity of merchantable timber, capable of yielding and producing 70 tons of freight in timber, lumber, and bark for each acre of land for transportation over said railroad.\u201d It is further alleged that \"in fulfillment of the said agreements the defendant railroad corporation, on the 1st day of February, 1890, executed \u201cits first mortgage or deed of trust\u201d to said trust company, conveying to it said railroad properties and franchises, and providing for an issue of bonds limited to $500,000, to be secured by said properties and the 46,000 acres of timlDer land to be conveyed by said Bullis and Barse to said trustee; \u201cthat the defendants Bullis and Barse caused said Bullis and Sarah E., his wife, to join with said railroad company in said mortgage,\u201d and that by said mortgage they assumed to convey to said trustee land contiguous to the line of said railroad, and free from incumbrances, and covered by a large quantity of merchantable timber, aggregating 30,-954.10 acres, and which, by the terms of the said agreements, was to be a condition precedent to the issue of $300,000 of said bonds to be used in the building and completion of said 46 miles of said railroad; that, in reliance upon the conveyance of the said land, bonds to the amount of $300,000 were issued, and were sold by said New-comb e &amp; Co., 10 of which were purchased by the plaintiff in the .action; that all of the proceeds of the said bonds have been used in the construction of said lines and in the payment of prior liens upon the property and the said constituent lines, and that the defendant railroad company, which is the consolidated company, is wholly without funds, and that the extension thereof is essential to enable it to obtain money to meet its liabilities; that said Bullis and Barse refused to convey to said trustee the remaining 16,000 acres of suc'h land, and to provide for the building of the balance of said railroad, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1051\">*1051</page-number>whereby the construction company is unable to proceed with its work of completing the same. The complaint further alleges that said 30,954.10 acres of land conveyed by Bullis and his wife were not free of incumbrances; that the same at that time were subject to prior liens, aggregating $159,000, besides interest; that $144,776.07 of said indebtedness still remain unsatisfied; that said land was not -covered with merchantable timber, but was waste land, from which the salable timber had been removed, and that a large portion of the said land was not adjacent to the line of said railroad, and the timber, thereon not accessible to be transported thereon; that a large portion of the land so assumed to be conveyed was not owned by either of the said defendants, and was not conveyed at all by said deed,\u2014all of which facts the said Bullis and Barse \u201cwell knew at the time they made\u201d said pretended conveyance, and said conveyance \u201cis in reality false and fraudulent\u201d; that, by reason of the \u201cfraud and failure\u201d of said Bullis and Barse to convey said land free of liens, \u201ca great fraud has been committed\u201d by them, which will cause irreparable injury to the bondholders, including the plaintiff, who is one of them, unless the performance of the said agreements and the conveyance of 30,000 acres of unincumbered timber land to said trustee are specifically decreed. The complaint further charges many derelictions of duty by said Bullis and Barse as directors of the said railroad corporation, and the diversion from their proper use \u201cfraudulently and secretly\u201d of steel rails and other properties belonging to said company, and they threaten further unlawful expenditures upon the credit and at the expense of the said company; that by reason of the unlawful acts of said Bullis and Barse the earning capacity of the company has been seriously impaired; that, pursuant to a provision in said trust conveyance providing for the release from the lien of the said mortgage of \u201cany portion or portions of said timber land\u201d upon payment of the value of the portions so released, to be ascertained by arbitrators appointed as the said conveyance provided, arbitrators were appointed, upon the request of Bullis and Barse, and appraised over 4,000 acres of said land at $1 per acre; that it is apparent therefrom that said Bullis and Barse \u201chad perpetrated a gross fraud\u201d upon said railroad company and upon the bondholders, as said land, if timber land, was of the value of $25 per acre. The complaint then asked for specific performance, \u201cor that said defendants pay to said-trustee, for the security of said bondholders, such a sum of money as the court shall ascertain to be equivalent to the value of said lands and real estate conveyed as aforesaid, which are not in conformity with the terms of said several agreements, and said bonds and the mortgage or deed of trust securing the same; and, in addition thereto, 16,000 acres of like timber land, in all respects similarly situated, and free from incumbrance, as security to authorize the issue of $200,000 of bonds, in said agreements specified and set apart for the construction of the 24 miles of railroad additional to the 46 miles above mentioned.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-5\">The complaint, therefore, is one in equity, demanding that the defendants comply with their several agreements, and charging that the defendants, in their attempted compliance therewith, falsely and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1052\">*1052</page-number>fraudulently foisted upon the trustee a conveyance which only apparently transferred the title to the large quantity of land desciibed in it, and that this fictitious transfer was in pursuance of the fraudulent scheme on the part of the said defendants; and the complaint asked for money compensation in the event of the inability of the defendants to fulfill their undertakings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-4\">A trial was had at a special term in New York county, and at the close of the evidence it appeared that Bull\u00eds and Barse were unable to perform specifically, and the court dismissed the complaint, declining to entertain jurisdiction for the purpose of awarding damages in lieu of strict performance. The judgment entered on this decision was reversed by the general term (O\u2019Beirne v. Bullis, 80 Hun, 570, 30 N. Y. Supp. 588), and, upon an appeal taken by the defendant railroad company, this judgment of reversal was affirmed by the court of appeals (O\u2019Beirne v. Railroad Co., 151 N. Y. 372, 45 N. E. 873). A new trial was had in the meantime upon the answers interposed by Bulks and Barse before Mr. Justice Barrett, and elaborate and explicit findings of fact were made by him, fully sustaining the charges contained in the complaint and upon whi.ch the allegations of fraud were based. The special term, among other facts, found that, before the execution of the several agreements referred to, said \u201cBulks and Barse pretended and represented to the said firm of I. B. Newcombe &amp; Co. that the said 30,000 acres of land were timbered, free and clear of all incumbrances, and contiguous and adjacent to the line of the defendant railroad company, as the same was then constructed and projected, and that said land was covered by a large quantity of merchantable timber, which would be sufficient to and would actually provide said railroad with at least 70 tons of freight to the acre, for conveyance over said railroad at rates from 25 to 50 cents per ton, in addition to the percentage accruing to said defendant railroad company from divisions with other lines;\u201d further that, before said agreements were entered into at the request of Bulks and Barse, engineers were sent from New York to inspect the timber on the land to be conveyed to said trustee; that \u201cthey were escorted through certain timber lands\u201d .by said Bulks, and the lands through which they \u201cwere escorted by said Bulks were heavily timbered,\u201d and that said Bulks \u201cstated that said lands were to be placed under said mortgage\u201d to said trustee, and a report in accordance with this statement was made by said engineers, and upon this report said Newcombe &amp; Co. \u201cembarked in the enterprise, and entered into said scheme of consolidation and extension\u201d; that said lands so \u201cdefined and pointed out by said Bulks were worth from $18 to $20 an acre\u201d; again that said Bulks and Barse \u201chad stated and represented to Newcombe &amp; Co.\u201d that the mortgage was to be a first lien, the lands to be well timbered and \u201ccontiguous and tributary to said lines of railroad\u201d; that said trust mortgage was approved and accepted in the belief that said representations were true in fact, and that Bulks and Barse were \u201cin good faith performing their said covenants.\u201d The court further found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1080-5\">\u201c(93) That the statements and representations of said defendants Bull\u00eds and Barse with respect 'to said timber lands, mentioned and referred to in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1053\">*1053</page-number>said Exhibits \u2018A,\u2019 \u2018B,\u2019 and \u20180,\u2019 and Schedule \u2018A\u2019 annexed to the complaint, were fraudulent, and made with intent to deceive. (94) That the plaintiff was in fact deceived by said statements and representations. (95) That said statements and representations were false and untrue. (96) That said agreement was in fact fraudulently made with respect of the lands agreed to be conveyed by said Bullis and Barse.\u201d That a great part of the lands included in the deed were not the property of Bullis, and the value of that owned by him and not timbered was $13,350, while that apparently covered by the deed, but not owned by him, was worth $175,502.77, and a considerable part of that included in the conveyance was incumbered.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1081-5\"><em>In the </em>conclusions of law the court decides it has \u201cjurisdiction to proceed in this cause, by reason of the fraud practiced by the defendants Bullis and Barse in the premises,\u201d ancTby the \u201cfact that the plaintiff has been deceived by the fraudulent statements and misrepresentations of the defendants.\u201d It directed \u201cimmediate specific performance\u201d by them by their conveying to the trust company \u201c30,000 acres of land free and clear of all incumbrances, and contiguous and tributary to the lines of the railroad of the defendant * * * timbered and profitable to said defendant railroad company, and of the market value of at least $18 per acre.\u201d Finally, the court directs and decides;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1081-7\">\u201cThat the defendants Spencer S. Bullis and Mills W. Barse at once pay to the Central Trust Company of New York the sum of $'.\u201992,125.00, with interest thereon at the rate of 5 per cent, per annum from the 1st day of February, 1892, for the pro rata benefit of the plaintiff, James R. O\u2019Beirne, and all other holders of the first mortgage bonds of the defendant the Allegany &amp; Kinzua Railroad Company.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1081-8\">The judgment entered upon this decision was affirmed. O\u2019Beirne v. Bullis, 2 App. Div. 545, 38 N. Y. Supp, 4; Id., 158 N. Y. 466, 53 N. E. 211.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-9\">The action for specific performance in the strictest sense thereof was founded upon the actual positive fraud of the defendants Bullis and Barse. They had in fact, in pretended compliance with their agreements, conveyed to the designated trustee 30,000 acres of land. The plaintiff alleged that the defendants fraudulently included in this conveyance lands not owned by the grantors and that the bulk of the tract was not timber land, was incumbered, and was not adjacent to the railroad lines described. Lands so located, and with heavy growing timber, had been shown to the engineers selected to inspect it, and a conveyance to a trustee of the lands represented was sought by the action. The gist, the intrinsic ingredient, of the action was cohsequently the fraudulent scheme,\u2014the false representations of these defendants. As was said by the court of appeals in its first review of the case (151 N. Y., at page 384, 45 N. E. 876); \u201cThe theory of the complaint and the tendency of the proof upon the trial were that a fraudulent scheme was devised by Bullis and Barse/\u2019 Jurisdiction was held to exist in the court of equity to award damages in lieu of decreeing specific performance in case the proof disclosed the inability to enforce a precise compliance with the agreements. When it developed upon the second trial that specific performance was unavailing, the trial court retained jurisdiction to proceed \u201cby reason of the fraud practiced by the defendants Bullis and Barse.\u201d The backbone of the action, whether viewed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1054\">*1054</page-number>strictly as one in equity, or for damages in lieu of equitable relief to compensate the bondholders for the misconduct of the defendants, was the fraud of the latter. As we interpret subdivision 2 of section 17 of the bankrupt law it does not limit the exception to common-law actions of fraud or deceit. The gist and gravamen of the action must have been the positive and intentional fraud of the bankrupt. The record presented must clearly show that such misconduct was the pith of the action, and it may not be dependent upon oral proof or other evidence outside of the record. There are many authorities construing the kindred section of the bankrupt law of 1867 (section 33), which provided \u201cthat no debt created by the fraud or embezzlement of the bankrupt * * * shall be discharged under this act.\u201d In Strang v. Bradner, 114 U. S. 555, 5 Sup. Ct. 1038, 29 L. Ed. 248, the discharge in bankruptcy was interposed to an action charging false and fraudulent representations made by one member of a copartnership, which included the defendants, who were not cognizant of the representations made. The court held that the fraud of the copartner was imputable to the other members of the firm, and in defining the fraud, which was within the purview of the section quoted, decided that it \u201cshould be construed to mean positive fraud, or fraud in fact, involving moral turpitude or intentional wrong, and not implied fraud, or fraud in law, which may exist without the imputation of bad faith or immorality.\u201d The same principle was reiterated, and the authorities analyzed, in Forsyth v. Vehameyer, 177 U. S. 177, 20 Sup. Ct. 623, 44 L. Ed. 723, and the court, at page 182, 177 U. S., page 625, 20 Sup. Ct., and page 725, 44 L. Ed., thus defines the representation which constitutes a fraud:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1082-5\">\u201cA representation as to a tact, made knowingly, falsely, and fraudulently, for the purpose of obtaining money from another, and by means of which such money is obtained, creates a debt by means of a fraud involving moral turpitude and intentional wrong. It is not necessary to enlarge upon the subject. It is so plainly a fraud of that description that its mere statement obtains our ready assent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1082-6\">In the authorities which I have examined no stress is laid upon the form of the action. While an action of fraud to the mind of a lawyer signifies the common-law action of fraud or deceit, the wording of the subdivision under discussion evidently was not framed with that precise remedy in view. The expression \u201cjudgments in actions for frauds\u201d conveys no such signification as that mentioned, and may include any positive intentional fraud which.was the basis of a judgment and was of the substance of the recovery. The statute is to be construed liberally to discharge the insolvent from the burden of the obligations which he is unable to pay in full, but that liberality may not be extended to an insolvent to release him from a judgment which was recovered against him by reason of his \u201cpositive fraud and intentional wrong,\u201d whatever may have been the form of the action in which the recovery was had. The primary purpose of the statute is to enable an insolvent debtor to be relieved from the burden of his obligations. One exception that has pervaded all of our bankrupt laws is that, where the insolvent has become <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1055\">*1055</page-number>liable for the payment of a debt which had its origin in his own positive dishonesty, the way is not open for his discharge from that liability. In one instance proof that the debt was created by fraud was sufficient to raise the barrier; in another, the debt must have ripened into judgment, but in each case the fraudulent misconduct is the basis of the prohibition, not the technical form which the indebtedness has assumed. As was said in Coll. Banlcr. (3d Ed.) at page 197:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1083-5\">\u201cThe fact that the judgment was in an action for fraud, or willful or malicious injury, may, perhaps, not appear by the judgment itself. That is not necessary; it is sufficient if it appear from the record of the case. If the record show that the action was for any of the causes specified, then the judgment is not barred by a discharge. The action must have been based on the fraud or the willful or malicious injury. It is not enough that there may have been incidental or immaterial false and fraudulent representations in connection with the transaction, if the action is not based on them.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1083-6\">And also at page 202:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1083-7\">\u201cThe debt, as we have seen under subdivision 2, \u00a7 17, Bankr. Law 1898, is not released by a discharge, although in the form of a judgment. But the record must show that the debt is so created. If a judgment is rendered in an action, the record of which shows material, traversable allegations of fraud, which were necessarily determined, then the judgment is conclusive.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1083-8\">In Re Rewensohn (D. C.) 99 Fed. 73, Justice Brown says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1083-9\">\u201cIn cases of this kind no purely technical considerations as to the precise form of the action should be regarded.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1083-10\">In Burnham v. Pidcock, 58 App. Div. 273, 68 N. Y. Supp. 1007, the action in which the judgment was recovered was for conversion. Neither the judgment nor anything in the record showed that fraud or fraudulent representations were an essential element of the cause of action, although the court, in its opinion, stated the act which constituted the conversion was fraudulent. The court held that the nature of the action must be gathered from the record, instead of from any extrinsic source. The court uses this language at page 275, 58 App. Div., page 1009, 68 N. Y. Supp.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1083-11\">\u201cThe judgments which are excepted from the effect of a discharge in bankruptcy are, as it is expressed in the statute, judgments for fraud. The phrase means that the fraud is the gravamen of the action in which the judgment is recovered, and that proof of the fraud is essential to the right of recovery. It does not include a judgment in which, the right of recovery is based upon an act which is not essentially fraudulent, although in that action fraud may be incidentally shown.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1083-12\">That case is not an authority \u2022 which is helpful to the appellant. In the present case the record shows that fraud was the marrow of the cause of action, and the sole ground for retaining jurisdiction and awarding damages was the fraudulent conduct of Bull\u00eds and Barse. No resort need be had to extraneous proof to show that fraud was not an incident, but the vital factor, in the action. The findings of fact passed upon by the trial judge are minute and circumstantial, and abound in facts from which the turpitude and deceit of the defendants are established. These findings are supplemented by conclusions of law, and the whole followed by the formal judgment, which bears the signature of the justice presiding, so that the record consists of the decision- and judgment made by the jus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1056\">*1056</page-number>tice himself, and forming one complete document. We think the respondent is not concluded because he elected to proceed by suit in -equity. He did not base his cause simply upon breach of contract, but on the fraud of Bull\u00eds and Barse, and emphasis is given to that element in the various appeals. The court, in its opinion in 80 Hun say, at page 573, 30 N. Y. Supp., page 590: \"That the \u2022facts found * * * conclusively show that Spencer S. Bullis and Mills W. Barse perpetrated an atrocious fraud.\u201d The court of appeals (158 N. Y. 466, 53 N. E. 211), in discussing its previous decision, observe, at page 468, 158 N. Y., page 211, 53 N. E.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1084-4\">\u201cThe theory upon which the decision proceeded was that they devised a traudulent scheme for the consolidation of certain railroads owned and controlled by them, issued bonds upon false representations as to the timber lands to be furnished as added security under the mortgage to make the \"bonds secure and salable; that upon those facts the court would have been justified in granting relief to the plaintiff against them.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1084-5\">With the fraud of the petitioner so marked a constituent in the record of which the judgment is a part, we are constrained to hold that he is not entitled to the cancellation of the judgment, as it is within the prohibition of subdivision 2 of section 17, referred to.</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-6\">The counsel for the respondent devotes much space in his brief to an argument that subdivision 4 of section 17 applies to this appeal. _ The position is that the terms \u201cfraud, embezzlement, misappropriation,\u201d in that subdivision, relate to an individual, while the word \u201cdefalcation\u201d alone applies to one \u201cacting as an officer or in \u2022a fiduciary capacity.\u201d We cannot assent to that construction. In the corresponding section (33) of the act of 1867, the interpretation \u25a0contended for may have been tenable. In the present section, however, the exceptions have been remodeled and reclassified, and the intention apparently was to make subdivision 2 applicable to frauds, \u25a0etc., perpetrated by an individual failing debtor, but protected him by limiting the prohibition against his discharge to frauds, false representations, etc., embodied in a judgment and provable by the record. Subdivision 4 was then designed to relate to an officer, or one acting in a trust capacity, and was enlarged in its scope\" by erecting a barrier to the discharge of such a culpable debtor who had been guilty of \u201cfraud, embezzlement, misappropriation\u201d as well as \u201cdefalcation.\u201d A person faithless in a public or' trust capacity is the more flagrant malefactor, and hence it may have been deemed advisable to extend the barrier to his receiving the benefit of a discharge permitted by the statute to include the other delinquencies named. The natural rendition of subdivision 4, as well as its grammatical construction, seems to favor this interpretation. If -any debt created by fraud, embezzlement, or\" misappropriation is to be excepted from the application of the statute, then there is no necessity of subdivision 2 making a judgment essential to prevent the granting of the discharge under the statute. The bare proving the debt was created by fraud would be sufficient to raise a bar to \u25a0the release of the insolvent therefrom, which would be tantamount to emasculating subdivision 2. We conclude, however, that the petitioner is barred by subdivision 2 from obtaining the cancellation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1057\">*1057</page-number>of the judgments, and that the order of the special term should therefore be affirmed, with $10 costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-5\">The order is affirmed, with $10 costs and the disbursements of this appeal. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
