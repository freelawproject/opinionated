We have, however, examined the complaint, and think it states a good cause of action. It is not contended by the appellant that the decision of the special term holding the counterclaim to be bad is erroneous, and it therefore follows that the judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
