Part of the damages claimed under the complaint, and concerning which evidence was offered by the plaintiff, was for loss of commissions for buying cattle in this country, to the extent of the capacity of the defendant\u2019s boats for the period specified, and for selling the same in England. Under the evidence introduced upon the trial, the question' as to whether plaintiff informed defendant prior to its alleged breach of the agreement that he had a contract for commissions on the purchase and sale of the stock intended to be shipped depended upon conflicting testimony, and was for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">The record shows that, after the denial of the defendant\u2019s motion for a dismissal of the complaint at the close of all the evidence, the plaintiff submitted to the court 6 written requests to charge, and the defendant submitted 11. The tenth request submitted by defendant is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-8\">\u201cThat if the plaintiff did not inform defendant on or prior to the 5th of November that he had a contract for commissions upon the cattle which he was to purchase for shipment under the terms contained in the telegrams \u25a0dated .October 25, 26, and 27,1897, he cannot recover any loss upon such commission.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b320-9\">In the charge which followed, the court made no reference to this request, and gave the jury no instructions upon the question to which it was directed. At the conclusion of the main body of the charge the record shows that the court said that at the request -of plaintiff two propositions there stated were charged, and these were, substantially, plaintiff\u2019s first and second requests. The record shows that the court then said that, at the request of defendant, certain propositions there stated were also charged, and these were, in effect, the first, second, sixth, and eighth requests made by defendant. The propositions thus charged at the request of plaintiff and at the request of defendant did not cover the subject-matter of \u25a0defendant\u2019s tenth request, herein quoted. Thereupon it appears by the record that defendant\u2019s counsel asked whether the court refused to charge his other requests, to which the court replied, \u201cThe third and fourth.\u201d Whereupon defendant\u2019s counsel said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-10\">\u201cI except to the refusal of the court to charge the third request, the \u25a0fourth request, the fifth request, the seventh request, the ninth request, the tenth request, and the eleventh request.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b320-11\">As has been seen, the court did not charge the requests to which these exceptions relate. The fair inference from the silence of the court is that the court did not intend to charge the other requests. It would stem that the court was proceeding to specify in their order the requests made by defendant\u2019s counsel which had not been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>charged, when defendant\u2019s counsel interrupted, and excepted to the refusal of the court to charge the requests not specifically charged-The defendant, according to the evidence introduced in its behalf,, understood that plaintiff was dealing in stock on his own account, and not as a commission agent. If the jury believed this evidence, they would not have been justified in awarding as damages commissions for the purchase and sale of the stock, for it could not be-said that such commissions constituted profits that were fairly within-the contemplation of the parties. To authorize a recovery, therefore, it was necessary to bring home to defendant knowledge that the shipping agreement was made with reference to such collateral contract for commissions. Witherbee v. Meyer, 155 N. Y. 446, 50 N. E. 58; Booth v. Rolling Mill Co., 60 N. Y. 487; Swain v. Schieffelin, 134 N. Y. 471, 31 N. E. 1025, 18 L. R. A. 385; Hadley v. Baxendale, 9 Exch. 341. It thus appears that defendant\u2019s tenth request should have been charged, and this error entitled defendant to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">It follows, therefore, that defendant was entitled to a new trial, as matter of right, for legal error, and in such case payment of costs of the action should not have been imposed as a condition of. granting the new trial. The order should be modified by striking out the provision thereof requiring defendant to pay the costs, and. as thus modified affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements to respondent to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
