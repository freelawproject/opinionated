She fell into a hole which the defendant negligently and unlawfully kept and maintained unguarded in the sidewalk on West Sixty-Second street, in the borough of Manhattan. The accident occurred on the afternoon of June 23, 1900, but the plaintiff knew of the existence of the hole as early as June 3d, and her negligence appears to have been predicated upon that fact chiefly, if not wholly. The mere fact that she knew of the existence of the opening in the sidewalk is not sufficient to make the question of her contributory negligence one of law. On the occasion in question she was carrying a basket. Her little brothers were with her, walking in front of her, as she says, \u201cabout the spot when I stepped in.\u201d She was not \u201cquite sure\u201d of the location of the hole at the time, and altogether the occurrence was such as, in accordance with well-established principles, required a submission to the jury, under proper instructions, oLthe question whether she exercised such care as the law enjoins; \u25a0 and, if she did, there could be a recovery notwithstanding her previous knowledge or momentary forgetfulness. Boyle v. Construction Co., 47 App. Div. 311, 61 N. Y. Supp. 1043; Weed v. Village of Ballston Spa, 76 N. Y. 329; Palmer v. Dearing, 93 N. Y. 7; Bullock v. City of New York, 99 N. Y. 654, 2 N. E. 1; Pomfrey v. Village of Saratoga Springs, 104 N. Y. 459, 469, 11 N. E. 43; Shook v. City of Cohoes, 108 N. Y. 648, 15 N. E. <em>531; </em>Dollard v. Roberts, 130 N. Y. 269, 29 N. E. 104, 14 L. R. A. 238.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-11\">The record discloses the fact that the plaintiff is an infant, but her age is not proven, and the respondent claims that this court may therefore assume that she was sui juris, and, indeed, to quote from the brief, that \u201cshe may have been in the last year of her infancy.\u201d To \"so assume would be to violate the well-known rule in cases of ' nonsuit (Kunz v. City of Troy, 104 N. Y. 344, 352, 10 N. E. 442, 445, 58 Am. Rep.. 508, 511) that \u201cthe plaintiff is entitled to the most favorable inferences deducible from the evidence.\u201d It does appear, however, that she was a school girl. She is spoken of in the testimony as \u201cthis little girl.\u201d One of her playmates, examined as a witness, was nine years old at the time of the trial, which occurred nine months after the accident; and the plaintiff was carried on The occasions when she was taken to and from the hospital. These facts rather require us, under the rule stated, to assume that the plaintiff may have been of such tender years as to require the question of her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>status within the law of negligence to be submitted to the jury for its consideration and determination, in which event, if she were found non sui juris, in the absence of negligence on the part of her parents, the doctrine of contributory negligence would have no application.

Rep. 508.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">The judgment should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">Judgment reversed, and new trial granted; costs to abide the event. AB concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
