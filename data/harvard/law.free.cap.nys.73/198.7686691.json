The justice found for the plaintiffs on evidence sustaining the finding, and we are not prepared to say that he erred in believing the testimony of the plaintiffs\u2019 witnesses. The exception especially called to our attention is found at page 25 of the return. The plaintiffs had called one Pearlman as a witness, and while testifying he made a statement that Herman J. Kumberger had told him that \u201che was going to play a trick on Mr. Miller,\u201d the defendant. Kumberger was thereafter put on the stand, and denied that he had made any such declaration. It was objected that the testimony was inadmissible, because it tended to impeach the evidence of the plaintiffs\u2019 own witness. It did not. True, having called Pearlman as a witness, the plaintiffs could not impeach his credibility, by attacking his general reputation. Pollock v. Pollock, 71 N. Y. 137, 152; Becker v. Koch, 104 N. Y. 394, 10 N. E. 701, 58 Am. Rep. 515; Crossman v. Lurman, 57 App. Div. 397, 68 N. Y. Supp. 311. But the party calling a witness is never precluded from proving the truth of a particular fact by any other competent testimony, in direct contradiction to what such witness may have testified. Thompson v. Blanchard, 4 N. Y. 311; Melhuish v. Collier, 15 Q. B. 878, 19 Law J. Q. B. 493; Pollock v. Pollock, 71 N. Y. 152; 2 Cow. Treat. (5th Ed., by Kingsley) \u00a7 1485; Pickard v. Collins, 23 Barb. 456; Parsons v. Suydam, 3 E. D. Smith, 276, 282; Hankinson v. Vantine, 152 N. Y. 20, 46 N. E. 292; Bannon v. Levy, 20 Misc. Rep. 581, 46 N. Y. Supp. 353. Showing that a witness was mistaken is not deemed an impeachment of the witness, within the rule that a party cannot impeach his own witness. Hildreth v. Shepard, 65 Barb. 265; Hynes v. McDermott, 82 N. Y. 41, 37 Am. Rep. 538. There was no \u00e1ttempt to show inconsistent statements made by Pearlman for the purpose of im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>peaching him, but Kumberger was allowed to correct Pearlman\u2019s mistake in regard to what he (Kumberger) had said. We find no error, and the judgment must be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
