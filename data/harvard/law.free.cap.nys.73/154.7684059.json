The tenant contended that the assignment to the petitioner, if any was made, was fraudulent; that ownership of the lease vested in the receiver, in bankruptcy, of the assignor of the lease; and that the tenant purchased the lease at a sale by the receiver of the assignor\u2019s property. Upon the petition and answer the only question presented for the determination of the justice was as to the right of possession of the described property.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-18\">The petitioner proved to the justice\u2019s satisfaction that two days before the appointment of the receiver in bankruptcy of the assignor (petitioner\u2019s husband) the assignment of lease was executed and delivered to her; that she took possession, and thereafter gave permission to the receiver to sell the assignor\u2019s goods remaining in the store; that she protested against a sale of the lease, and refused to allow the purchaser of the assignor\u2019s goods to remain on the premises; that on the day of the assignment, July 9, 1901, she saw the owner of the property, told him of the assignment, and paid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>$125, the rent for July. The landlord\u2019s acceptance of the rent with knowledge of the assignment was sufficient evidence of his consent or waiver. Ireland v. Nichols, 46 N. Y. 413; Murray v. Harway, 56 N.

Supp. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">The exceptions do not present reversible error, and the justice\u2019s finding on the facts is amply authorized. Final order affirmed, with \u25a0costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">Order affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
