There is undoubted authority for the rule that, where there are several items having their origin in one contract,\u2014as an agreement to sell and deliver goods, or perform work or advance money,\u2014these may be included in a single cause of action. Secor v. Sturgis, 16 N. Y. 558. But, as said in the case cited, in referring to this rule, \u201cthere must be either an express contract, or the circumstances must be such as to raise an implied contract, embracing all the items, to make them, where they arise at different times, a single or entire demand or cause of action.\u201d If, in the present action, instead of suing on three separate contracts for the sale of merchandise, the plaintiff had sued on three promissory notes, pleading them as a single cause of action, little argument would be required to show that this could not be done against the defendants\u2019 objection under section 483 of the Code. And where, as here, the liability under each contract is distinct, and the evidence in support qf the cause of action based on one contract cannot be used to prove defendants\u2019 liability on the other two, the view to be taken is no different than in the illustration which we have suggested of the promissory notes, which, though all for the payment of money, still bore different dates, were payable at different times, and the evidence required to obtain a recovery upon one would not be available to show the liability of the maker upon the other two. We think, therefore, that the defendants were entitled as matter of right, under section 483 of the Code of Civil Procedure, to have the complaint separately number and state the facts constituting the alleged breach of the defendants, and set forth their liability on each contract as a separate cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">The order accordingly should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion granted, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
