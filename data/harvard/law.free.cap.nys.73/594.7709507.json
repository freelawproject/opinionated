William N. Shipman, the plaintiffs husband, became a member of one of the subordinate organizations of the defendant at Titus-ville, in the state of Pennsylvania, on the 1st day of March, 1897. He- received a copy of the defendant\u2019s charter, constitution, and by-laws, in su printed book, with his certificate of membership, and, very soon after receiving the same, gave them to his wife, the plaintiff. The certificate provided that the defendant would pay to the wife the sum of twenty-five hundred cM~ lors within ninety days after proof of death of the said William N. Shipman, provided that he was then in good standing in the order. It required: the monthly payment of two and seventy-one hundredths dollars premium, smcl recited that it was issued in consideration of certain representations and declarations made by him,\u2014amdng others, that he would conform, in all respects-to the laws, rules, and usages of the defendant order then in force, or which. \u2022 might thereafter be adopted by the defendant, and agreed that eomplianeeon his part with all such laws, regulations, and requirements then in force, or that might thereafter be enacted by the defendant, should be the express condition upon which he was to be entitled to participate in the beneficiary fund. The certificate itself, upon its face, provides for the payment of the-sum of twenty-five hundred dollars, \u201cpursuant to the provisions of the laws of this order governing the benefit fund, and relating to the granting and! payment of benefit certificates, within ninety days after the receipt by the-supreme circle [the defendant] of satisfactory evidence of the death of the-member to whom this benefit certificate is issued: provided always, that said member shall be in good standing in this order at the time of death.\u20191\u201d In May, 1897, the defendant\u2019s by-laws were amended by adding thereto the following section:</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b623-5\">\u201cArticle XI, section 13, Suicide. The benefit certificate issued to a membe\u201d shall become void, and all benefits thereunder shall be forfeited, in case t\u00edasinsured shall die by suicide, felonious or otherwise, sane or insane, or by Mes-own hand, sane or insane. Provided, that in such case there shall be refunded to the beneficiary named in said certificate the amount of all payments-made, together with interest thereon at the rate of three per cent, pesannum.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b623-6\">The by-laws were also amended at the same time, by changing the age ati which persons might become members, and increasing the monthly rates.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b623-7\">No notice was ever given to William N. Shipman, or his wife, the plaintiff\", of any of these changes; -and it is conceded that the increase in the monthly-premium was not applied to members who had become members of the defendant order previous to the time that such changes in the by-laws took effect. The beneficiary, the wife of the said William N. Shipman, paid the monthly premiums at the original rate of \u00a72.70 per month, as required by the defendant, up to the 5th day of April, 1900, at which time the said William N. Shipman came to his death by suicide. It is now claimed by the defendant that this amendment to its by-laws in Blay, 1897, which provided thatc the benefit certificate issued to a member should become void, and all benefits; thereunder be forfeited, in case the member should die by suicide, applies tc&gt; this certificate, and that all the benefits thereunder were forfeited, except that, the amount of payments, together with interest at the rate of 3 per cent, per annum, should be paid to the beneficiary. It is to be observed that the covenant or condition regarding the laws, rules, and usages, both present andD prospective, is that he will conform thereto, and promises full compliance therewith, as a condition; and it is not very clear that this had reference to such an amendment as would exclude the liability of the defendant; entirely in the event that the member came to his death by his own act of suicide. It may well be suggested that this reservation to amend its bylaws, with reference to which the member promised to comply, referred to other matters ordinarily incident to the management of such associations, and not to such a vital matter as impaired its liability and limited the risk upon which the original certificate of membership was obtained. I am inclined, however, to the opinion that the defendant had the right to make this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>change in its by-laws, and that it could have limited its liability, even as regards such of its members as had become members of the defendant order before the change was made. The serious question is as to whether, under all the facts and circumstances in this case,- it can be said that it was the intention of the defendant to so limit its liability as regards the certificate of membership in question. It will be observed that there was no express provision in this amendment making it applicable to outstanding beneficiary certificates. Neither the amendment itself, nor any resolution or action of the \u25a0defendant, indicates affirmatively that it was intended to so apply to the then members of the defendant order. No notice was given by it to the member, so far as the evidence discloses in this case, nor to the plaintiff bene\u2022ficiary. The monthly premium remained at the same rate, although the rates were increased at this same meeting when the amendment regarding -suicide was enacted, and other changes were made; yet, as regards members who had become such before the amendment, the rates remained the same, \u2022and the plaintiff paid the same rate which she had paid originally; and no* claim is made that these other amendments applied to Shipman, or any of the other members who were members at the time when these amendments took effect. Under these circumstances, I am of the opinion that this amendment forfeiting the benefits under the certificate in case the insured should \u25a0die by suicide does not apply to the certificate issued to Shipman before the amendment was passed by the defendant order, and which is the subject of this controversy; for, as said in Nib. Mut. Ben. Soc. p. 64: \u201cMembers may contract in reference to laws of future enactment; may agree to be bound by any future by-laws or amendments which may be passed by the. society, as if they were existing at the date of the contract. They may consent that new by-laws or amendments shall enter into and form parts of their contracts, modifying or varying them. But the fact that a member has consented to be bound by future laws or amendments does not alter the rule that they will be given a prospective operation, in the absence of a clear intent that they shall act retrospectively.\u201d This rule was applied in Spencer v. Grand Lodge, 22 Misc. Rep. 147, 48 N. Y. Supp. 590, where it appeared that the benefit society had amended its by-laws, limiting the beneficiary to persons who should be related to the member by blood, or members of his family or dependent upon him; and it was held that it did not apply to certificates which had been theretofore issued, and that provisions of that kind would not be given a retroactive interpretation unless such an intent was clearly manifest. This case was affirmed by the appellate division upon the opinion of Mr. Justice Spring at special term. 65 N. Y. Supp. 1146.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b624-4\">The plaintiff is entitled to judgment for the full amount, with interest.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b624-5\">Argued before ADAMS, P.
