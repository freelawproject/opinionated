Maier against Joseph H. Rebstock. From an order which changed the place of trial of the above-entitled action from the county of Seneca, where it was brought, to the county of Erie, with $io costs of motion, upon the ground that the action was brought to procure a judgment annulling a contract affecting an interest in real property situate in the county of Erie, and that, therefore, under section 982 of the Code of Civil Procedure, Erie was' the proper county in which to try such action, plaintiff appeals.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"AZd\">Reversed.</disposition>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b845-10\">Argued before ADAMS, P.

Judgment is demanded for the purchase price paid, together with the expenses so necessarily incurred by the plaintiff, with interest thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-14\">The action is one at law. No equitable relief is demanded, and none could be awarded. The title to real property can be in no manner affected by any judgment which may be properly rendered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>in this action, and such judgment can in no manner affect any interest in the real property mentioned in the complaint. It is not an action \u201cto procure a judgment directing a conveyance of real p: operty, * * * [0rJ establishing, determining, defining, forfeiting, annulling or otherwise affecting an estate, right, title or other interest in real property or a chattel real.\u201d Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 982. If the plaintiff shall succeed in the action, judgment for a sum of money only can be awarded to him. Such judgment cannot properly contain any provision or direction respecting the real property described in the complaint or any interest therein. It is immaterial to the plaintiff whether or not the defendant accepts a reconveyance of the property, and the judgment which may be awarded cannot compel such transfer. One of the steps essential to entitle the plaintiff to the judgment asked for is a tender of a reconveyance, and undoubtedly such tender must be kept good, but whether it shall be accepted or not is entirely optional with the defendant. In Hogg v. Mack, 53 Hun, 463, 6 N. Y. Supp. 301, it was held that the mere fact that a question as to the title to real estate might have to be passed upon in suit did not make it imperative that the case should be tried in the county where the land was situated. In the case at bar there is no question of title even to be passed upon. In the case of Hogg v. Mack, supra, it was further held that the section (982) did not apply to an action at law to recover damages for a breach of the contract, although that contract related to real property. Becker v. Town of Cherry Creek, 70 Hun, 6, 24 N. Y. Supp. 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">The conclusion is reached that the cause of action alleged in the complaint is not one of those specified in section 982 of the Code of Civil Procedure, and that, therefore, Seneca county, where the plaintiff resided, was the proper county in which to bring the action. It follows that the order should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and motion denied, with $10 costs. All concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
