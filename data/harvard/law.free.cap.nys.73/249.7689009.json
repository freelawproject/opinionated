The affidavit of an attorney in fact averred that it would be impracticable to frame interrogatories covering the evidence, as he had been informed by counsel. <em>Held, </em>that as an open commission to examine witnesses out of the state will not be granted, except under peculiar circumstances, and only when facts show the necessity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>for resorting to that practice, the grounds stated were insufficient upon which to issue such a commission.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b278-4\">3.

We know of no authority which justifies the granting of such a commission upon the facts set out in this record. An open commission to examine witnesses out of the state will not be granted, except under peculiar circumstances, and then only when the facts stated show the necessity for resorting to that course of practice. Food Co. v. Scott, 28 App. Div. 59, 50 N. Y. Supp. 896; Einstein v. Electric Co., 9 App. Div. 570, 41 N. Y. Supp. 808. Here all that appears is that the plaintiff\u2019s attorney swears that he desires an open commission, and the attorney in fact swears that the plaintiff\u2019s attorney has advised him that it would be practically impossible to frame interrogatories so as to cover all the evidence to be proved by the witnesses desired to be examined. Not a single fact is alleged in either of the affidavits showing the necessity for an open commission. On the contrary, it appears from the affidavit of the attorney that the plaintiff has disclosed to him what he expects to prove by the witnesses named, and, if this statement be true, then there is no difficulty in framing interrogatories sufficient to elicit the testimony sought to be obtained; and as to the other witnesses, whose names are not given, the affidavit states that the attorney cannot give them until after he has had a consultation with his client. If he cannot give the names of the witnesses until he has consulted with his client, it is difficult to see, in the absence of a statement of facts bearing upon the subject, or what he could prove by them, how the attorney knows that their testimony would be material. Indeed, the only reason assigned by the attorney, in fact (and an affidavit of the client is not presented), is \u201cthat it will be. practically impossible to frame interrogatories so as to cover all the evidence to be proved by the witnesses, as he is advised by counsel and verily believes.\u201d Not a single fact to sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>port this conclusion is given, and all the counsel says on the subject is that \u201che desires 'an open commission.\u201d Manifestly, an open commission cannot be granted upon such proof. If it could, then it could be granted in. any case, irrespective of the proof presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">The fact that the plaintiff has given security for costs has no bearing upon the subject, and cannot be considered in determining whether or not the commission shall issue. The defendant in an action has a right, in certain cases, given to him by statute, to demand security for costs; and the fact that security was here given was because the defendants were entitled, under the statute, to the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">The order appealed from, therefore, must be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion denied, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
