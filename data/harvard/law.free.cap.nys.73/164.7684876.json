Newton, 10 How. Prac. 560; Manken v. Pape, 65 How. Prac. 453), the defendant was, nevertheless, bound to appear upon the day to which the proceedings had been adjourned by his counsel, and the failure to appear upon that day was disobedience -to the order, and, constructively, at least, contempt of court. The defendant evidently intended not to disrespect, for, having obtained an order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>from the bankruptcy court staying the plaintiff\u2019s proceeding, he evidently believed that the function of the state court had come to an end. But the order was not served in time to prevent the default of the defendant to be noted, and, being in default, the bankruptcy court modified its stay by allowing the proceedings to punish for contempt to proceed to a hearing. This meant that the city court might fine or imprison, if either was proper under the circumstances. The court imposed a fine of $250 and allow'ed $50 costs. The $250 imposed was the extreme limit of the law, no loss or damage having been proven. There was no adjustment of the items of the cost, but the $50 is imposed as a lump sum. We think that under the circumstances the fine, aggregating $300, was excessive against the bankrupt defendant, and was imposed on the erroneous theory that the contempt was willful, when it evidently was not, and that pecuniary loss had followed, and there was no proof of that.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">The order must be reversed, unless the plaintiff within 10 days stipulates to reduce the amount to $50 and $10 costs. In that case the order as modified will be affirmed, without costs in this court or in the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">Order reversed, unless plaintiff within 10 days stipulates to reduce amount of fine to $50, with $10 costs. In that event, order as modified affirmed, without costs in this court or court below.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
