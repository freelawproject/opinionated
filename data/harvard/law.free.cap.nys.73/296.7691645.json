The answer admitted that the defendant owned certain wires used for lighting the premises, and denied other allegations of the complaint; averring that any injuries sustained by the plaintiff\u2019s son were caused solely by his own negligence, <em>a </em>At the opening, motion was made to dismiss the complaint on the ground that it did not state sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action, and that the action, being for death caused by negligent act, should have been brought by an executor or administrator, under section 1902 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which motion was denied. The manner in which the death of the plaintiff\u2019s son occurred was described by his employer, who testified that he had sent the boy upstairs to arrange a sign Which had been turned over by the wind, and while he was in front of the store watching him attending to this, \u201cI noticed all of a sudden that he cried out, and then there was a spark shot out of him, and the instant he done that, I rushed upstairs, and caught him as he fell back in my arms dead.\u201d The coroner\u2019s physician also testified that \u201cthe cause of his death was shock after charge of live electric wire at 69 Cortlandt street.\u201d At the conclusion of the plaintiff\u2019s case, motion to dismiss the complaint was renewed and was granted, and from the order thereupon entered and from judgment dismissing the complaint the plaintiff brings this appeal. &lt;</summary>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b325-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>Argued before VAN BRUNT, P.

It is contended by the appellant that the cause of action set up in the complaint is warranted by the common law. \u2022 On the other hand, the respondent contends that there is no such common-law action, and that the only person who could bring an action to recover for the death would be the personal representative of the minor son by virtue of section 1902 of the Code of Civil Procedure; and that an action for loss of services can only be brought to recover such services as may be lost during the time between the alleged wrongful act and the death resulting _ therefrom. Evidently what is sought in this action is to recover for loss of services to which the father would have been entitled had the son lived, but there is no authority either in common law or by statute for such an action. Undoubtedly, the father could recover for the loss of services if the injury had not resulted in death, and he could recover for such loss between the time of the injury and death. He could not, however, at common law recover for loss of services of a minor son owing to his death through another\u2019s negligent act, if such death, as in the case at bar, was instantaneous. This subject was discussed at length, and authorities bearing thereupon were collated, in the case of Green v. Railroad Co., 2 Abb. Dec. 277, and among others which are cited therein with approval is that of Carey v. Railroad Co., 1 Cush. 475, 48 Am. Dec. 616, which is identical with this action, and where, as stated, \u201cthe plaintiff\u2019s child was instantly killed by the carelessness of the defendant\u2019s servant and the father brought his action to recover damages for loss of service. The court declared the common law to be decisive against the action.\u201d And in Sorensen v. Balaban, 11 App. Div. 164, 42 N. Y. Supp. 654, it was said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-6\">\u201cIt clearly was the rule at common law that no civil action would lie for causing the death of a human being. Cooley, Torts, 262. While a hus.band or parent might maintain an action for a wrong causing loss of services, from a wife or child if the injury resulted in death, this could not at the common law be taken into account either as a ground of action or as an aggravation of damages, and the plaintiff\u2019s recovery would be limited to loss of service intermediate the injury and death. * * * Of course, for many years the statute has prescribed a remedy for such wrongs. An action for a wrongful act causing death of any person may be maintained by the executor or administrator of such person for the benefit of his next of kin. Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 1902.\u00bb</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">An interesting discussion of this same subject will be found in the case of Davis v. Railroad Co. (Ark.) 13 S. W. 801, 7 L. R. A. 285, where the rule is thus stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>\u201cWhere the injury resulted in death, the father\u2019s recovery by the common law was limited to the interim between the disabling injury to the child audits death. His right of recovery was restricted to the value of the minor\u2019s' services and the cost of medical attendance and nursing to the time of death. The right fell with the life of the minor. This was- upon the theory that no civil action would lie for a right springing from the death of a human being.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">Prior to the statute there could be no recovery in the case of death..- It was considered that life was too precious to be compensated for by money. The only punishment for negligence was in a criminal proceeding. As we became more commercial, the legislature put a price upon a life, and then removed the limitation. Now recoveries may be had, but only in the way prescribed by the statute for the pecuniary damages sustained by the next of kin of' the deceased, when the death has been occasioned by negligence and the decedent is free from contributory negligence; The action which the plaintiff here endeavored to maintain on his own behalf and for his own benefit and the action provided for by section 1902 of the\" Code are not identical, the latter being one that must be maintained in the name of the executor or administrator for the benefit of the next of kin. For the reasons stated, the judgment dismissing the complaint must be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">The appeal from the order should be dismissed, the order not being appealable. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
