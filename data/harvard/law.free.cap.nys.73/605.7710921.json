Assuming, without deciding, that this view is correct, there can be no doubt that the petitioner, through his or her attorney, could consent that the court direct that a part of the disbursements be paid, not out of funds in the hands of the committee, but out of other moneys belonging to the incompetent person. This is precisely what the learned judge below declares to have been done in the present case. By the order appealed from he has amended the original order by inserting therein a recital to the effect that, \u201cby the consent of the attorney for the petitioner,\u201d $500 of the sum allowed said petitioner is to be paid out of moneys in the hands of the Massachusetts committee. We cannot assume that this recital, carefully inserted after a full review of the occurrences attending the making of the original order, is untrue. It must represent the judge\u2019s recollection of what occurred, stated under the sanction of his official oath; and, if such a consent was given, the petitioner cannot complain of the order, either in substance or form.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-9\">Orders affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
