The maker offered as security railroad bonds held as collateral by another bank, but subject to an attachment and to an injunction in supplementary proceedings. The maker inclosed an order on the bank having the collateral, to hold for the bank, which was the owner of his note, his equity in such collaterals, stating that the attachment and injunction order had been taken care of, and that the bank holding the note should have whatever equity he had over and above the attachment, without any obligation to extend the notes, but, if the attachment was removed within a week, then the notes to be extended as asked.

Jarvis, as receiver, over a fund of $15,000, the proceeds of $100,000 of second mortgage bonds of the Peoria, Decatur &amp; Evansville Railroad Company. Both parties claim through or under the defendant David J. Mackey, the former owner of the bonds. The facts on which the plaintiff\u2019s claim is founded are as follows: On November 11, 1893, the said Mackey was indebted to the plaintiff as maker of two promissory notes,\u2014one for the sum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>of $35,000, dated June 12, 1893, and payable four months thereafter; and the other for the sum of $5,000, dated August 9, 1893, and payable four months thereafter,\u2014and also as indorser of a third note for $25,000, made by the Peoria, Decatur &amp; Evansville Bailroad Company, dated July 26, 1893, and payable two months thereafter. All of the notes were partially secured by collaterals. The two notes for $25,000 and $35,000, respectively, were overdue. Mackey was unable to take them up, and applied to the plaintiff for an extension of time. The plaintiff\u2019s president testifies: \u201cMr. Mackey asked for an extension, and we told him we must have more collateral,\u2014more margin. * * * He applied to have the notes renewed, and we told hint we would do it,\u2014that is, if he would give us additional collateral,\u2014which he agreed to do in this $100,000 of Peoria, Decatur &amp; Evansville Bailroad.\u201d At this time the bonds were in the possession of the National City Bank, which held them as security for a loan theretofore made to Mackey. They were also subject to an attachment which had been issued in an action against Mackey, brought by the New York Security &amp; Trust Company, and on the 2d of November the City Bank, as a party having property of a judgment debtor, had been served with an order, containing the usual injunction, in proceedings supplementary to execution upon a judgment recovered against Mackey by the Seaboard National Bank. Following the arrangement for an extension above referred to, and on said 11th of November, Mackey wrote the plaintiff a letter, in which, after referring to his indebtedness to the plaintiff on the said three notes for $35,000, $5,000, and $25,000, respectively, he said: \u201cI would say to you that, conditioned on your extending the payment of all such notes until the 11th day of January, 1894, I have written a letter, which I herewith inclose, to the City Nat\u2019l Bank, No. 52 Wall St., authorizing them to hold for you the equity that I have in certain collateral deposited with them. * * * There is an existing attachment on the collateral with , the City National Bank, but that attachment is to be removed within the next week. I authorize you to deliver to the City National Bank the letter that I herewith inclose, immediately, and with the understanding that you shall have whatever equity there remains there to me over and above the attachment, without any obligation on your part to extend the notes; but, if the attachment herein referred to is removed within the next week, them it is understood that the notes are extended as herein provided.\u201d In a postscript the writer said: \u201cThere are two liens filed under the City National Bank collaterals of mine,\u2014the New York Security &amp; Trust Co. and tho Seaboard National Bank. Both have been taken care of, and the attachments are to be removed next week.\u201d In the letter to the City Bank Mackey directed the bank to hold the bonds (subject to its lien) \u201cfor any existing indebtedness of myself, either as maker of promissory notes or indorser of promissory notes held by the Bank of the Metropolis, of the city of New York, and this will be your authority for so doing.\u201d On November 13th the City Bank wrote the plaintiff, acknowledging the receipt of Mackey\u2019s letter of the 11th, and saying: \u201cWe will do whatever .we can to protect your interests in the matter referred to therein.\u201d A few days later Mackey assigned to E. P. Huston and W. J. Lewis, of Evansville, Ind. (through whom the defendant Jarvis claims), the said railroad bonds and other collateral held by the City Bank. It is admitted that the injunction order contained in the order in supplementary proceedings in the case of the Seaboard Bank was vacated on December 21, 1893, and that the attachment in the case of the New York Security &amp; Trust Company was withdrawn on December 26th.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b558-5\">The defendant Jarvis insists that the plaintiff has failed to show any right in or title to the fund; that there was no legal assignment to the plaintiff by Mackey of his interest in the bonds; that there was no agreement on the part of the plaintiff to extend the notes; and that the proposed transfer of the bonds to the plaintiff as additional security came to nothing, because the plaintiff was not to be bound to grant the extension asked for unless the attachment of the. security and trust company was vacated during-the following week, and the attachment was not gotten rid of for a long time thereafter. It seems to me that the facts of the case justify a contrary conclusion. They may be summarized as follows: The notes were overdue. Mackey applied for time. The plaintiff agreed to grant it if furnished with additional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>security. This Mackey agreed to give. He offered as such security the 10G&gt; Peoria &amp; Decatur bonds then, held as collateral by the City Bank. It was satisfactory to the plaintiff. Mackey directed the City Bank to hold the bonds, subject to its prior claim, for the plaintiff\u2019s benefit; that is, for Ms indebtedness to the plaintiff as maker or indorser, which the City Bank in substance agreed to do. At the same time he notified the plaintiff that the bonds were then subject also to the lien of an attachment which would be removed during the next week, and in his letter of notification said that, if the attachment \u201cis removed within the next week, then it is understood that the notes are extended as herein provided.\u201d Thereafter, \u201cwithin one week or-two weeks,\u201d he informed the plaintiff \u201cthat it was all cleaned up; there was no indebtedness against it\u201d; and the plaintiff gave him the extension.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b559-4\">The learned counsel for the receiver argues that at any time between the 11th of November (the date of Mackey\u2019s letter to the plaintiff) and the 26tli. of December (the day when the attachment was withdrawn) the plaintiff' could have brought suit upon the overdue notes, and that such suit could not have been defended by Mackey on the ground that payment of the notes-had been extended. That may be so, but it does not prove that th\u00e9 plaintiff was not a holder or transferee for value of Mackey\u2019s interest in the bonds. If the plaintiff had discovered that Mackey\u2019s- promise to remove the attachment had not been kept, and that his subsequent assurance that \u201cit was all' cleaned up\u201d was not true, it might have taken immediate steps to enforce payment of the notes, and there could have been no defense, because Mackey\u2019s right to demand an extension under his arrangement with the plaintiff depended upon the attachment being removed in accordance- with his stipulation. But, in my judgment, the plaintiff might safely rely, as it undoubtedly did rely, upon the representations of Mackey,\u2014First, that the attachment-had \u201cbeen taken care of,\u201d and would be removed; and, second, that \u201cit. was all cleaned up.\u201d As between the plaintiff and Mackey, the plaintiff was not bound to make inquiry, or otherwise test the truth of what he said.. It believed his statements, and, so believing, gave him the indulgence he requested. Mackey therefore received from the plaintiff the very consideration, for which he made the transfer of his interest in the bonds.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b559-5\">In Insurance Co. v. Smith, 23 Hun, 535, the court cited with approval the-early case of Mapes v. Sidney, Cro. Jac. 683, where the defendant was held liable upon his promise to pay a debt in consideration that the plaintiff would forbear to sue one F. S. upon it, and it appeared that the forbearance had in fact been secured. Judge Daniels said: \u201cNo time was there agreed upon, but still it was held that the plaintiff was entitled to recover, as the object the party had in view in making the promise was actually obtained.\" That is the case here. On the faith of the security he offered and the representations he made concerning it, Mackey obtained the extension he applied\" for, and neither he nor his subsequent transferees should now be permitted to assail the plaintiff\u2019s title to such security on the ground that such representations were not true.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b559-6\">As this conclusion disposes of the only question at issue in the case, it is not necessary to consider other points discussed by counsel.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b559-7\">There should be judgment for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b559-8\">Argued before VAN BRUNT, P.
