This will was executed on the 28th day of February, 1871, at which time the testatrix had but one child. At the date of her death, viz. September 25, 1895, she had six children, all living, and one of them, and one only, a son, had a child, to wit, the infant defendant, Mary Olyphant Emmet, whose father, however, has since died. The question in the case is whether the real estate was devised to the children alone, each taking an undivided sixth part, or to the children and the grandchild together, each taking an undivided seventh part. The referee adopted the first suggestion, while the court at special term decided in accordance with the second. The will is brief. After the giving of a general legacy and the creation of two annuities, for the maintenance of annuities the executor is directed to invest sufficient of the estate to yield the necessary amount. It then provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-5\">\u201cI do give and bequeath all the rest, residue, and remainder of my estate of every kind and description, and all the estate and property of every kind over which I have power of appointment or control, to my lawful issue, to be equally divided between them. I do nominate and appoint my beloved husband, Richard S. Emmet, to be the executor of this, my will, and I do give him full power and authority to sell and convert into money all the real estate whereof I may die seised and possessed, and to invest the proceeds of such sales, and all other personal property whereof I may die possessed, in such manner as he may deem most for the interest of my child or children.\u2019\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">It is unnecessary to devote time to an elaborate discussion of the term \u201cissue,\u201d as the meaning to be given it has been often exhaustively considered, both in England and in this <em>country.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">In Palmer v. Horn, 84 N. Y. 516, Judge Earl said (page 519):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-8\">\u201cThe word \u2018issue\u2019 is an ambiguous term. It may mean descendants generally, or merely children; and whether, in a will, it shall be held to mean the one or the other, depends upon the intentioji of the testator as derived from the context or the entire will, or such extrinsic circumstances as can be considered. In England, at an early day, it was held, in its primary sense, when not restrained by the context, to be coextensive and synonymous with \u2018descendants,\u2019 comprehending objects of every degree. But it came to be apparent to judges there that such a sense given to the term would in most cases defeat the intention of the testator, and hence in the later cases there is a strong tendency, unless restrained by The context, to hold that it has the meaning of \u2018children.\u2019 It will at least be held to have such meaning upon a slight indication in the other parts of the will that such was the intention of the testator.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b643-9\">In Drake v. Drake, 134 N. Y. 220, 32 N. E. 114, 17 L. R. A. 664, where, by a divided court, the broad construction was given to the word \u201cissue\u201d in its application to the donees of a power of appointment, Judge Bradley said (page 224, 134 N. Y., page 116, 32 N. E., and page 668, 17 L. R. A.):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-10\">\u201cIn its general sense, unconfined by any indication or intention to the contrary, the word \u2018issue\u2019 includes in its meaning all descendants. * * It may, however, when such appears to have been the intent with which the word is used, have the restricted import of \u2018children.\u2019 * * * The word \u2018issue\u2019 may be a word either of purchase or limitation, and will be construed the one or the other as may be necessary to effectuate the intent with which it appears to have been used in the instrument where it is employed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b643-12\">In Soper v. Brown, 136 N. Y. 244, 32 N. E. 768, 32 Am. St. Rep. 731, Judge Andrews, referring to the word \u201cissue,\u201d said (page 249, 136 N. Y., page 770, 32 N. E., and page 734, 32 Am. St. Rep.);</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>\u201cThere are many authorities on wills in which the word has been construed to mean \u2018children\u2019 only. These authorities rest upon the undisputed principle that words used by a testator in his will are to be interpreted in the sense which he attributed to them, where it appears by the context that they were not used in their strict legal sense. It is but one of the applications of the doctrine that in the construction of wills the intention of the testator is to govern when not inconsistent with the rule of law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">In Chwatal v. Schreiner, 148 N. Y. 683, 43 N. E. 166, Judge Haight stated the proper rule of construction as follows (page 688, 148 N. Y., and page 167, 43 N. E.):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-5\">\u201cThe rule, therefore, is that the word \u2018issue,\u2019 in its general sense, in the absence of any indication of intention to the contrary, includes in its meaning descendants generally. But when it is apparent from the extrinsic circumstances, proper to be considered, or the provisions of the will, that the testator intended \u2018children,\u2019 its meaning will be limited.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">See, also, Palmer v. Dunham, 125 N. Y. 68, 25 N. E. 1081.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">In Schmaunz v. Goss, 132 Mass. 144, the word \u201cdescendants\u201d in a will was construed as synonymous with \u201cchildren,\u201d although it is apparent that the use of that word would be regarded among laymen as a stronger indication of an intent to include grandchildren than would the use of the word \u201cissue.\u201d Said James, L. J., in Ralph v. Garrick, 11 Ch. Div. 873, 883:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-8\">\u201cNow, the word \u2018issue\u2019 is an ambiguous word. In the ordinary parlance of laymen it means \u2018children,\u2019 and only \u2018children.\u2019 When you talk of what \u2018issue a man has,\u2019 or what \u2018issue there has been of a marriage,\u2019 you mean \u2018children,\u2019 not \u2018grandchildren\u2019 or \u2018great-grandchildren.\u2019 But in the language of lawyers, and only in that language, it means \u2018descendants\u2019; and in the case of Sibley v. Perry, 7 Yes. 524, Lord Eldon found ground for coming to the conclusion that the word \u2018issue\u2019 had, in the will before him, the laymen\u2019s meaning of \u2018children,\u2019 and not the lawyer\u2019s meaning of \u2018descendants.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b644-9\">In the will now before us I think there is some evidence that the testator intended to refer in the words \u201clawful issue\u201d to the direct issue of her marriage, her own issue; in other words, as distinguished from the issue of such of her children as should be married and living at the time of her decease. The language employed in the direction to the executor to sell the real estate, and to invest the proceeds of such sales and the personal property in' such manner as he should deem best for the interest of \u201cmy child or children,\u201d is surely some indication that she considered that the residuary provision was for the benefit of her then only child and such other children as might be thereafter born to her, and whose interests alone were to be considered in the investment and preservation of the property. At that time she was a very young woman, under 28 years of age, and her only child a mere baby, and it would be unusual, indeed, if in disposing of her property by will she then contemplated the necessity or propriety of providing for possible grandchildren at the expense of her own children, especially where the living parent of such grandchildren would be, as her child, an equable sharer in her bounty. Under the circumstances of this case, and in view of the fact that there were no children of deceased children, it is quite within the rule of Chwatal v. Schreiner, supra, to limit the meaning of the words \u201clawful issue\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>to the words \"my child or children\u2019\u2019 as used indiscriminately and convertibly by the testatrix, and as applied by her to her immediate \"issue\u201d as the intended residuary legatees and devisees.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">It follows that the interlocutory judgment, in so far as appealed from, should be reversed, and judgment directed upon the referee\u2019s report in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">Interlocutory judgment, In so far as appealed from, reversed, with costs, and judgment directed upon the referee\u2019s report.
