The second order was made upon the denial of the plaintiff\u2019s motion to-resettle the first by adding thereto the requirement that an amended answer be served. The appeal from the second order must be dismissed, as such an order is . not appealable. Concerning the first order, it is quite evident that it should have contained a provision requiring the service of the amended answer. An examination of the pleading from which irrelevant and redundant matter was stricken out renders that apparent. Where a pleading is reformed as radically as was the answer in this case by the order of the court striking out' certain parts of it, the reformed or substituted pleading-should be served. The answer condemned in this case set up various separate defenses, the fourth of which was preceded by the formula \u201crealleging, reasserting, and reiterating each and every allegation hereinbefore contained.\u201d That formula was stricken out,, as were also certain affirmative allegations incorporated in the. fourth defense. The plaintiff may desire to demur to what is left of the-fourth defense, and cannot well do so with nothing to present to the-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>court but the answer as originally drawn and the order of the court striking out parts thereof. The defendant should have been required to serve an amended answer, and the order granting the motion to strike out should be modified by inserting a proper provision requiring such service.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-3\">The appeal from the order to resettle order must be dismissed, with $10 costs. The order striking out parts of the answer should be modified as above directed, with $10 costs and disbursements to the appellant. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
