This was not disputed, the plaintiff himself testifying: \u201cI didn\u2019t go.upstairs to see where the leak came from. I did not know where the leak came from.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b973-11\">\u201cThe mere fact of the overflow established no wrong against the defendant. * * * The plaintiff was bound to go further, and establish that the overflow was caused by some negligence on the part of the defendant.\u201d Steinweg v. Biel, 16 Misc. Rep. 47, 37 N. Y. Supp. 678. This he did not do, nor does it appear that the defendant omitted any precaution of a reasonably prudent man. It certainly does not appear that he placed, or caused to be placed, the refuse in those pipes, creating the stoppage; and under the decision of Spencer v. McManus, 82 Hun, 318, 31 N. Y. Supp. 185, he would not be liable for the acts of his tenants, at least in the absence of notice. Judgments of the court below reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-13\">Judgments reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide event.
