The court of appeals, in 166 N. Y. 462, 60 N. E. 187, has decided that this very board was acting judicially in this matter, and that its action is subject to review in the civil courts by a writ of certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-9\">That question being settled, we are now called upon to review those proceedings, and the attorney general practically concedes that they were not such as are required in tribunals exercising judicial functions. When the relator appeared before such board he asked to be represented by counsel. That privilege was denied him. Such refusal was an error which, in itself, requires that the decision of such board be reversed and set aside. Nichols Case, 79 N. Y. 582 ; People v. Keeler, 99 N. Y. 485, 2 N. E. 615, 52 Am. Rep. 49; People v. Hannan, 56 Hun, 471, 10 N. Y. Supp. 71; People v. Flood, 64 App. Div. 209, 71 N. Y. Supp. 1067. This conclusion renders it unnecessary to examine any of the other alleged errors of which the relator -complains.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-10\">The determination of the board must be reversed, and \u201corders No. 37,\u201d which is based thereon, must be vacated and set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-11\">We are asked by the relator to also vacate \u201corders No. 7.\u201d That was the order which convened and created the board whose proceedings we are now reviewing. It was made by the governor, and antedated all such proceedings. It is not within the scope of this writ, and therefore should not now be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-12\">Determination of the board of examiners reversed, and \u201corders No. 37\u201d vacated, with $50 costs and disbursements.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
