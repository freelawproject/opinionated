This motion comes up with an appeal taken from the order aforesaid, and is made upon the ground that manifest injustice has been done to the tenants. This practice is provided for by section 3064 of the Code of Civil Procedure, made applicable to municipal courts by section 1367 of the charter (Laws 1897, c. 378). Campbell v. Lumley, 24 Misc. Rep. 196, 52 N. Y. Supp. 684. It appears that the trial had been set down for May 2, 1901, at 9:30 a. m., and that the tenants\u2019 default was taken almost immediately after that time. At 10 o\u2019clock on the same morning the counsel retained by the tenants appeared in the belief that the court would not open before the last-mentioned time, and, finding that the tenants\u2019 default had already been taken, and that judgment had been entered against them, and the warrant signed, he immediately procured an order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>to show cause why the default should not be opened, and the warrant vacated, and the tenants allowed to defend. This order to show cause was returnable the following morning, May 3d, and contained a stay of proceedings under the warrant. \"At that time the \u2022 court, without deciding the motion to open the default, concluded to hear the testimony, and accordingly the parties proceeded as upon a regular trial. The following day, however, the court filed a decision denying the motion to ope-n the default, and failing to pass upon the merits of the issues, and thereupon the warrant was executed. Under all the circumstances disclosed it sufficiently appears that manifest injustice has been done to the tenants, and that the case comes within the provision of the section of the Code before referred to.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">Final order reversed, and a new trial ordered, with, costs to the appellants to abide the event. An order of restitution is also granted, but without costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">Final order reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellants to abide event, and order of restitution granted, without costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
