By this provision the procedure under the condemnation, law seems to be added to this section for the purpose of determining the questions therein presented. As a part of that procedure, an appeal is authorized by a defendant only from a final order in the proceeding. See Village of St. Johnsville v. Smith, 61 App. Div. 380, 70 N. Y. Supp. 880. By section 3359 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which is a part of the condemnation law, it is provided, \u201cWhenever any person is authorized to acquire title to real property, for a public use by condemnation, the proceedings for that purpose shall be taken in the manner prescribed in this title.\u201d In the preceding section real property is defined as \u201cany right, interest or easement therein or appurtenances thereto.\u201d If, then, the procedure under the condemnation law has become a part of the railroad law by reference thereto in section 12, this appeal is unauthorized, and the-motion to dismiss the same should be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-12\">Appeal dismissed, without costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
