We must assume that the jury correctly determined the facts necessary to sustain the verdict. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>defendant was successful in urging its counterclaim, and the plaintiffs appealed. The counterclaim is based upon an alleged breach of contract on the part of the plaintiffs, and presents the only question we need discuss. The defendant purchased from plaintiffs certain garments known as \u201cjackets,\u201d and one of the conditions of the agreement of purchase was that the plaintiffs would not sell any of these jackets to anybody else. Upon sufficient evidence, the jury found the plaintiffs guilty of a breach of this agreement. It is the claim of the plaintiffs that this contract was void and unenforceable, since it is in restraint of trade. The contract in question restrained the manufacture and sale of one particular article of a certain design or pattern only, and the benefit it was intended to confer was reasonable. It must be said that the restraint imposed was partial, and well within the rule of enforceable contracts of this nature, as laid down in the leading authority on this subject, viz. Match Co. v. Roeber, 106 N. Y. 473, 13 N. E. 419, 60 Am. Rep. 464.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
