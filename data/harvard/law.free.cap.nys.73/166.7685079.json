The facts are conceded. The mortgagor still owns the property. The alleged assignment is contained in the bond given by the mortgagor to the plaintiffs, and by its terms was to become operative upon default in the payment of principal or interest. Subsequent to the mort<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>gagor\u2019s default, the plaintiffs notified the defendant of the assignment, and the recovery is' for rent accruing after the service of the notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">We see no reason why a mortgagor may not, if he so desires, agree with his mortgagee, and so stipulate in the bond, to assign the rents of the mortgaged property in the event of his default. \u201cModus et conventio vincunt legem.\u201d The fact that the bond and mortgage also authorize the appointment of a receiver does not affect the assignment. And the appellant\u2019s contention that, because the assignment immediately follows the provision for the appointment of a receiver, the parties contemplated that the rents would, on his appointment, be assigned to him, is not tenable. A receiver does not need an assignment of the rents which he is appointed to receive; and a prior assignee of the rents would have a superior title. Harris v. Taylor, 35 App. Div. 462, 54 N. Y. Supp. 864. The power of the mortgagor to make the assignment is undoubted. Moffatt v. Smith, 4 N. Y. 126; Riley v. Sexton, 32 Hun, 245; Morris v. Niles, 12 Abb. Prac. 103.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">The judgment must therefore be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
