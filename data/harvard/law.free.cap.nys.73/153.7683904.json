The answer denies a sale, and as a defense alleges that the goods were left with the defendant to be sold by him for the plaintiff, and that any portion of the goods remaining unsold should be returned to plaintiff; that the defendant sold a portion of said goods for the sum of $21.70, which amount defendant there and then deposited in court \u201cas a tender before trial.\u201d On the trial the plaintiff put in evidence a writing signed by the defendant, ordering the goods in suit, stating the quantity and prices, with the significant recital, \u201cTerms, thirty days from date of invoice, or 2 per cent, discount for cash in ten days,\u201d and the following declaration: \u2018The above order, with condition, terms, prices, etc., is correct in every particular; there being no agreements or understanding whatever other than those stated, and we hereby order the shipment to be made as above.\u201d Across the bill is written the name, \u201cH. H. Simmons, Salesman.\u201d This writing is a valid contract for the sale and' delivery of the goods therein mentioned. Bonesteel v. Flack, 41 Barb. 435; Engelhorn v. Reitlinger, 122 N. Y. 76, 25 N. E. 297, 9 L. R. A. 548; Thomas v. Scutt, 127 N. Y. 133, 27 N. E. 961. Despite this fact, and against the plaintiff\u2019s objection, the court allowed the defendant to testify that the goods in question were not sold to him, but were merely delivered to be sold for account of the plaintiff. Such evidence, in the absence of an allegation of fraud or the like, was clearly inadmissible, and the plaintiff\u2019s exception to its admission presents reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>Moreover, the so-called \u201ctender\u201d of defendant was not made until after suit brought, and costs were not allowed to the plaintiff in the judgment. This is also erroneous; for a tender made after suit should include the interest and costs of suit up to the time of such tender. Ellenstein v. Klee, 12 Misc. Rep. 112, 33 N. Y. Supp. 94; Eaton v. Wells, 82 N. Y. 576.
