This provision clearly requires that the justices who heard the appeal, as such justices, may allow an appeal to be taken to the appellate division from such determination. This necessarily requires that the justices should act as such justices, and not as a court, and the order should be signed precisely the same as any order which is made out of court. Of course, under the provisions of the law, a majority of the justices, upon application \"to the whole, may allow an appeal. The order in this case does not \u25a0conform to this provision. The allowance of the appeal is not signed by the justices who heard the appeal or any of them as such, and \u25a0 consequently does not comply with the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-7\">The motion to dismiss the appeal will not be' granted, but an opportunity will be given to the appellant to perfect his papers.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
