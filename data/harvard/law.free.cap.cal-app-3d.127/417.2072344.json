J.</author>\n<p id=\"A4O\">This petition, by a juvenile, challenges a determination that he is not a fit and proper subject to be dealt with under the Juve<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>nile Court Law. He raises three claims which focus upon operation of recent amendments to Welfare and Institutions Code section 707. We accept his contention that the presumption of unfitness contained in subdivision (c) of section 707 does not apply to an allegation of attempted robbery. Thus, we grant the writ without reaching petitioner\u2019s other claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\">Welfare and Institutions Code section 707, subdivision (a) provides that when a minor is alleged to be a person described in section 602 of the Welfare and Institutions Code because of a crime committed when 16 years old or older the court may evaluate certain criteria and determine that he or she is not a fit and proper subject for treatment under Juvenile Court Law. Under subdivisions (b) and (c) of section 707 (unless otherwise indicated all citations are to Welfare and Institutions Code), if the minor \u201cis alleged to be a person described in Section 602 by reason of the violation\u201d of 16 specified crimes, the minor \u201cshall be presumed to be not a fit and proper subject to be dealt with under the juvenile court law\u201d unless the court finds otherwise upon evaluation of the five specified criteria.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b310-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>The \u201c602 petition\u201d filed against petitioner alleges attempted robbery in violation of Penal Code sections 664 and 211, use of firearm in the commission of that offense, burglary in violation of Penal Code section 459, and possession of a sawed-off shotgun in violation of Penal Code section 12020. On July 7, 1981, following the filing of the \u201c602 peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>tion\u201d the district attorney noticed a motion for a hearing, pursuant to section 707, subdivision (b), to obtain a ruling that petitioner was not fit for treatment under Juvenile Court Law. At the hearing petitioner objected that none of the 16 specified offenses listed in section 707, subdivision (b), had been charged, and challenged the court\u2019s jurisdiction to proceed under that subdivision. The court rejected the jurisdictional challenge, and after hearing entered an order finding petitioner unfit. This petition followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">Petitioner challenges section 707, subdivisions (b) and (c) as creating an arbitrary presumption and as placing upon petitioner the difficult decision whether to risk self-incrimination by testifying concerning his fitness for juvenile court treatment. We do not reach these issues (which have been recently decided by Division Four of this district in <em>Sheila O. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1981) 125 Cal.App.3d 812 [178 Cal.Rptr. 418]), because we find section 707, subdivisions (b) and (c) inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">The presumption of unfitness created by section 707, subdivision (c), and applied by the trial court applies only where the minor is \u201calleged to be a person described in Section 602 by reason of the violation, ...\u201d of one of the 16 specified offenses. Although robbery while armed with a dangerous or deadly weapon is one of the listed crimes (\u00a7 707, subd. (b)(3)), the list does not mention attempted robbery or attempt to commit any other crime. We reject the Attorney General\u2019s suggestion that \u201crobbery while armed with a dangerous or deadly weapon\u201d includes \u201cattempted robbery.\u201d Had the Legislature intended the presumption to apply to less serious attempt crimes, it certainly would have done so explicitly.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">In argument below, the district attorney suggested that while no robbery was consummated the facts showed that an assault with a firearm did take place. Both assault with a firearm and assault by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury are crimes listed in subdivision (b) of section 707. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 707, subds. (b)( 13) and (14).) The Attorney General notes that petitioner has been charged in municipal court with assault with a deadly weapon (Pen. Code, \u00a7 245, subd. (a)) and argues that it would exalt form over substance to invalidate the trial court\u2019s action when an amended 602 petition could charge one of the listed crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>We cannot look to what the prosecution <em>might have done or might do. </em>The fact is that the 602 petition did not allege violation of a listed crime, yet the district attorney brought his motion under section 707, subdivision (b), rather than subdivision (a), and the court accepted his argument that the presumption of unfitness applied. The trial court\u2019s error was prejudicial to petitioner, in that it caused the burden of persuasion to shift from the prosecution to petitioner. Thus, we must vacate the court\u2019s determination of unfitness.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">We have reached our conclusion after full briefing by the parties. No purpose would be served by issuance of an alternative writ, which would only delay further proceedings. A peremptory writ in the first instance is proper. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1088; <em>San Diego Wholesale Credit Men\u2019s Assn. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1973) 35 Cal.App.3d 458 [110 Cal.Rptr. 657]; <em>Goodenough </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1971) 18 Cal.App.3d 692, 697 [96 Cal.Rptr. 165].)</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">Let a peremptory writ of mandate issue restraining the San Francisco Municipal Court from any further proceedings on the complaint against petitioner and directing the San Francisco County Superior Court to vacate its order finding petitioner unfit for treatment under Juvenile Court Law and to reconsider its ruling. Unless the petition is first amended to allege violation of one of the crimes specified in subdivision (b) of Welfare and Institutions Code section 707, such reconsideration shall take place pursuant to Welfare and Institutions Code section 707, subdivision (a). The stay previously issued in this proceeding is dissolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">Feinberg, J., and Barry-Deal, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b309-5\">Full text of Welfare and Institutions Code section 707: \u201c(a) In any case in which a minor is alleged to be a person described in Section 602 by reason of the violation, when he or she was 16 years of age or older, of any criminal statute or ordinance except those listed in subdivision (b), upon motion of the petitioner made prior to the attachment of jeopardy the court shall cause the probation officer to investigate and submit a report on the behavioral patterns and social history of the minor being considered for a determination of unfitness.
