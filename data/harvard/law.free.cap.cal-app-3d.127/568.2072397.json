J.</author>\n<p id=\"An\">On January 12, 1978, a pedestrian, Jacob Zodieru, was struck by a vehicle driven by appellant Amanda Ball. Ruth Zodieru, Jacob\u2019s wife, was not present at the scene of the accident nor did she suffer any physical injuries as a direct result of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>At the time of the incident, Amanda was insured by virtue of a policy of insurance issued by respondent State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company. The policy limits applicable to bodily injury coverage were specified in the agreement to be $50,000 each person, $100,000 each occurrence.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">Jacob and Ruth Zodieru thereafter filed suit against Amanda; Jacob for bodily injuries and resulting special damages, Ruth for loss of her husband\u2019s consortium.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">On September 28, 1979, State Farm filed its complaint for declaratory relief, wherein it sought a determination of the amount of coverage available to Amanda respecting Ruth\u2019s claim, its own position being that such coverage should not exceed the $50,000 \u201ceach person\u201d limit.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">The trial court, on State Farm\u2019s motion for summary judgment, so decided. This appeal followed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">A review of the pertinent provisions of the insurance policy in question provides the framework for our disposition. So, it is initially set out as \u201cCoverage A\u201d under the contract that State Farm agrees \u201cTo pay on behalf of the insured all sums which the insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages because of (A) bodily injury sustained by other persons ...</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">It is then specified under the \u201cLimits of Liability\u201d portion of the agreement that, respecting coverage A, \u201cThe limit of liability stated in the declarations as applicable to \u2018each person\u2019 is the limit of the company\u2019s liability for all damages arising out of bodily injury sustained by one person in any one accident, and subject to this provision, the limit of liability stated in the declarations as applicable to \u2018each accident\u2019 is the total limit of the company\u2019s liability for all such damages for bodily injury sustained by two or more persons in any one accident. For the purposes of this provision the \u2018bodily injury sustained by one person\u2019 as used herein, shall be deemed to include all injury and damages sustained by others as a consequence of such bodily injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b389-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>Finally, it is provided in the applicable \u201cDefinitions\u201d section that \u201cDamages\u2014wherever used with respect to coverage A includes damages for care and loss of services.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">In <em>United Services Automobile Assn. </em>v. <em>Warner </em>(1976) 64 Cal.App.3d 957 [135 Cal.Rptr. 34], in a factual setting otherwise substantially identical to that present (except that the initial, direct injury was to the wife rather than to the husband), the limitation of liability provisions of the insurance policy involved specified that: \u201c\u2018The limit of bodily injury liability stated in the declarations as applicable to \u2018each person\u2019 is the limit of the company\u2019s liability for all damages, including damages for care and loss of services, arising out of bodily injury sustained by one person as the result of any one occurrence; the limit of such liability stated in the declarations as applicable to \u2018each occurrence\u2019 is, subject to the above provision respecting each person, the total limit of the company\u2019s liability for all such damages arising out of bodily injury sustained by two or more persons as the result of any one occurrence.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">It was posited there that: \u201cThe sole issue argued in this appeal is which policy limit applies to the husband\u2019s claim for loss of consortium. Does the claim for loss of consortium arise out of bodily injuries sustained by \u2018one person\u2019 (the wife) so as to make the \u2018per person\u2019 limit applicable; or is the claim for loss of consortium a claim for bodily injury to a second person (the husband) so as to invoke the \u2018per occurrence\u2019 limit for injuries to \u2018two or more persons as a result of any one occurrence.\u2019\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 961.)</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">The conclusion reached was that the loss \u201carose out of\u201d the bodily injury suffered by the person (there the wife) who was involved in the accident. In so deciding the court in <em>Warner </em>observed that: \u201cThe cause of action for loss of consortium does not arise out of a bodily injury to the spouse suffering the loss; it arises out of the bodily injury to the spouse who can no longer perform the spousal functions. It is the loss of conjugal fellowship, affection, society and companionship which gives <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>rise to the cause of action. <em>(Rodriguez </em>v. <em>Bethlehem Steel Corp., supra, </em>12 Cal.3d 382, 405-406 [115 Cal.Rptr. 765, 525 P.2d 669].)</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">\u201cAlthough a sensitive person may actually suffer physical illness as a result of being deprived of that conjugal affection, it is not that illness which gives rise to the claim. The fact that loss of consortium may have physical consequences does not convert the cause of action into an action for bodily injury to the spouse suffering the loss. Such consequences would be an element of damage, the consequential damage arising out of the .bodily injury to the injured spouse.\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>at pp. 964-965.)</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">Based upon this analysis, and the fact that in terms of it the language of the policy was not ambiguous, the judgment of the trial court in favor of the higher limit of insurer liability was reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">Here it is even clearer the \u201ceach person\u201d liability limit is appropriate, since there is, in addition to the language found in the <em>Warner </em>policy, the further proviso that \u201cFor the purposes of this provision the \u2018bodily injury sustained by one person\u2019 as used herein, shall be deemed to include all injury and damages <em>sustained by others as a consequence of </em>such bodily injury.\u201d <em>(Italics added.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">It is nevertheless urged by appellants that <em>Warner </em>is not dispositive, in that the decision therein either did not involve or failed to address any question having to do with what, it is said, is present and determinative here, namely the reasonable expectations of the insured at the time the policy agreement was made. Thus it is pointed out Amanda\u2019s husband had indicated to State Farm\u2019s agent on applying for insurance that he wanted \u201cfull coverage,\u201d that he expected to receive a policy which would be \u201cboth appropriate and adequate,\u201d and that he believed the language \u201c$50,000 each person, $100,000 each accident\u201d meant that up to $50,000 would be available to <em>each person </em>making a claim arising out of a single accident, to a total possible exposure by State Farm of $100,000 per accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">We are satisfied, however, the contention cannot be sustained and that of necessity, as respondent suggests, there can be no resort to the doctrine of reasonable expectations in instances, like that at bench, where no ambiguity exists in the language of an insurance contract. While such agreements, because of their otherwise adhesive and technical characteristics, have long been viewed as unique, in that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>presumption persons are familiar with the terms of written contracts to which they are parties and that in the absence of fraud they ordinarily are bound by the provisions therein is not strictly applied to them (see <em>Raulet </em>v. <em>Northwestern etc. Ins. Co. </em>(1910) 157 Cal. 213, 230 [107 P. 292]), it is not now and never has been true that one may, in the face of clear and explicit terms in the policy, fashion a contrary interpretation binding upon the insurer by virtue of an undisclosed assumption or understanding of what those terms meant. (See <em>Valdez </em>v. <em>Interinsurance Exchange </em>(1966) 246 Cal.App.2d 1, 7 [54 Cal.Rptr. 906]; <em>Perkins </em>v. <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund Indem. Co. </em>(1941) 44 Cal.App.2d 427, 429 [112 P.2d 670]; <em>Carabelli </em>v. <em>Mountain States L. Ins. Co. </em>(1935) 8 Cal.App.2d 115, 117 [46 P.2d 1004].)</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">The judgment appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">Compton, J., and Beach, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">A petition for a rehearing was denied January 13, 1982, and appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied March 3, 1982.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b388-9\"> Jacob and Ruth Zodieru were parties to State Farm\u2019s suit and they, like Amanda, filed cross-complaints therein, also seeking declaratory relief. The summary judgment, of course, disposed of these as well as State Farm\u2019s complaint. No appeal, however, was filed by the Zodierus.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b389-7\"> As the quoted language appears in the policy, certain terms are italicized for purposes of reference to definition provisions therein. So, by way of example, the terms \u201cbodily injury,\u201d \u201cpersons\u201d and \u201cdamages\u201d are in this fashion distinguished from other language in the contract.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
