Code, \u00a7\u00a7 211, 211/664)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and was also found to have used a firearm in each count (\u00a7 12022.5).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">On June 21, 1978, appellant was sentenced by the court to serve nine years and four months in state prison. The court arrived at this sentence by selecting the middle term of three years for one robbery, enhancing this sentence by two years for use of a firearm, and adding four years and four months for consecutive terms.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">On June 29, 1979, the Board of Prison Terms (hereinafter the Board) filed a motion with the trial court to recall appellant\u2019s sentence on the ground that his sentence was \u201cdisparate\u201d when compared to sentences received by similarly situated prisoners convicted of the same crimes. This motion was brought pursuant to the Board\u2019s mandate under section 1170, subdivision (f) which requires that body to recommend recall of all sentences which it determines to be disparate.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Based on its finding of disparity, the Board recommended that appellant\u2019s sentence be recalled and that he be resentenced for a term of six years and eight months. The district attorney filed points and authorities in opposition to the Board\u2019s motion. On August 3, 1979, the sentencing court heard and denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">Since this is the first motion filed pursuant to section 1170, subdivision (f), the instant action presents a question of first impression to this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>court; namely, what is the legal effect of a motion brought by the Board to recall a sentence on the ground of \u201cdisparity\u201d?</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">Appellant contends that a section 1170, subdivision (f) motion creates a rebuttable presumption that the sentence imposed was \u201cincorrect\u201d and that the prisoner is therefore entitled to have the original sentence recalled, unless the trial court overcomes this presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">Respondent, on the other hand, contends that the motion does not create any presumption, that the trial court can grant or deny the motion in its discretion, and that there is absolutely no burden which must be met to support a denial of the motion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">We conclude that neither appellant nor respondent is wholly correct in its interpretation of the legal effect of a motion brought pursuant to section 1170, subdivision (f). Instead we hold that although a section 1170, subdivision (f) motion does not create a presumption that a prisoner is entitled to be resentenced, the Board\u2019s finding of disparity is entitled to great weight in the trial court\u2019s determination of whether re-sentencing is proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-8\">Preliminarily, we deal with respondent\u2019s argument that denial of a section 1170, subdivision (f) motion is nonappealable.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-9\">Respondent argues that the case at bench is not appealable by virtue of <em>People </em>v. <em>Niren </em>(1978) 76 Cal.App.3d 850 [143 Cal.Rptr. 130], In <em>Niren, </em>defendant pled guilty to arson and was sentenced to prison. The court then requested a report pursuant to former section 1168. At that time former section 1168 authorized the court to recall a commitment and to impose a more lenient sentence if the court, in its discretion, thought it proper to do so. The trial court in <em>Niren </em>refused to recall the sentence because it received an unfavorable report .on defendant from the Director of Corrections. Subsequent to this denial, defendant made his own motion to recall the sentence, which was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>On appeal from defendant\u2019s motion, the Court of Appeal held that defendant had no standing to appeal the denial of his motion for recall. This holding was based on two earlier cases which had held that recall proceedings under section 1168 could not be initiated by a defendant. <em>(Thomas </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1970) 1 Cal.3d 788, 790 [83 Cal.Rptr. 327, 463 P.2d 709]; <em>Alanis </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1970) 1 Cal.3d 784, 786 [83 Cal.Rptr. 355, 463 P.2d 707].) Since defendant had no standing to make a motion to recall the sentence under former section 1168, the Court of Appeal reasoned that the trial court\u2019s denial of the motion was nonappealable.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">The case at bench differs from <em>Niren </em>in one crucial respect. In <em>Niren </em>defendant improperly initiated a motion to recall his sentence at the trial court level; he then appealed from the denial of his own improperly brought motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">In the instant action, there is no question that the motion was properly initiated by the Board. The question here is: Assuming that the motion for recall was properly initiated by the Board, does the prisoner have the right to appeal from the denial of that motion <em>even though he could not have initiated the motion himself!</em></p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">Section 1237, subdivision 2 provides that a criminal defendant may appeal \u201c[f]rom <em>any </em>order made after judgment, affecting the substantial rights of the party.\u201d (Italics added.) Application of this section is not confined to orders resulting from motions initiated by defendant; rather, by its own terms, the statute applies to \u201cany\u201d order affecting the substantial rights of the party.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">The \u201cright\u201d which appellant is asserting is his \u201cright\u201d to receive a sentence which is not disparate when compared to sentences received by other similarly situated convicts. Underlying this is appellant\u2019s right to liberty\u2014and to suffer only that deprivation of liberty which his crimes warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">The facts of this case are analogous to those of <em>People </em>v. <em>Coleman </em>(1978) 86 Cal.App.3d 746 [150 Cal.Rptr. 415]. In <em>Coleman, </em>the defendant was committed to a state hospital for an indeterminate period. Defendant later petitioned the court for his release under former section 1026a. After a trial by jury on the issue of defendant\u2019s sanity, a verdict was returned denying petitioner\u2019s request for release.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>Although no specific statutory provision provided for an appeal in those circumstances, the <em>Coleman </em>court held that the defendant could properly appeal from the denial for the request for release by authority of section 1237, subdivision 2. \u201cSince an order denying release following restoration proceedings results in continued indefinite commitment to a state hospital or other medical facility, a fortiori it must be construed as an appealable \u2018order made after judgment, affecting the substantial rights\u2019 of the defendant. (\u00a7 1237, subd. 2).\u201d (P. 750.)</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">The denial of the order in this case will not result in \u201ccontinued indefinite commitment.\u201d However, it will result in appellant continuing to serve a sentence which the Board has found to be \u201cdisparate\u201d given appellant\u2019s crime and past criminal record. As a result of the trial court\u2019s order, appellant will spend three extra years in a penitentiary over and above the time the Board has determined other similarly situated convicts received for similar crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">The determinate sentencing law (DSL) in general, and the review provisions of section 1170, subdivision (f) in particular, indicate that the Legislature believed that a prisoner has a \u201csubstantial right\u201d to receive a sentence which is consistent with the sentences received by other similarly situated prisoners. Since the trial court\u2019s order denying the motion for recall clearly \u201caffected\u201d this \u201csubstantial right,\u201d the case is appealable by virtue of section 1237, subdivision 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">\n<em>The Disparate Review Process</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">In order to determine the legal effect that should be given to the Board\u2019s finding of disparity, it is necessary to examine the process which leads to that finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-9\">The disparate review process is not designed to uncover legal error in sentencing. Instead, the process mandated by section 1170, subdivision (f) concerns itself with the statistical uniformity of DSL sentences imposed on those convicted of similar crimes under similar circumstances. (Cal. Admin. Code, tit. 15, \u00a7 2100 (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b415-10\">The Board has gathered information on the DSL sentences imposed in this state. This information includes data on each DSL prisoner\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>criminal history, his social history, the circumstances of the offense, and the sentence itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">Utilizing this information, the Board undertakes a three-step process to identify \u201cdisparate\u201d sentences. First, the Board identifies other cases to which the subject case is similar. Second, the Board uses statistical analysis to identify \u201cvariant\u201d cases; that is, cases that do not conform to an \u201cobserved sentencing pattern\u201d occurring within the cases grouped as \u201csimilar.\u201d These variant cases are distinguished from \u201cnonvariant cases\u201d (those cases which do conform to an observed sentencing pattern occurring within the cases grouped as similar). In the third step of the process, the variant cases are examined on a case by case basis to determine if there are other factors present in those cases (not taken into account in the original statistical analysis) that would explain or justify the more severe sentence. If no additional aggravating circumstances are identified, the Board, in its discretion, can find that the sentence is \u201cdisparate\u201d and must recommend recall of the sentence pursuant to section 1170, subdivision (f).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">In the-present action, appellant\u2019s case was compared to 54 other DSL cases involving multiple robberies. The Board found that judges sentencing multiple count robbery cases generally imposed consecutive sentences for counts which occurred in separate \u201cincidents,\u201d but imposed concurrent sentences for counts based on separate victims in the same \u201cincident.\u201d The Board identified seven variant cases out of the sample of 54 multiple robbery cases that did not conform to this observed sentencing pattern. In six of the variant cases the Board identified \u201cunusual\u201d aggravating circumstances that justified the more severe sentences. These aggravating circumstances included unusually long and serious criminal histories of those sentenced, actual injury to the robbery victims, the loss of large amounts of money, \u201cmistreatment\u201d of the victims, and the use of \u201covert\u201d threats in the robberies.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">However, the Board concluded that the variant sentence imposed in appellant\u2019s case could not be explained by any similar aggravating circumstances. Rather, the Board found that appellant\u2019s criminal, social, and personal history, as well as the circumstances surrounding the commission of his robberies, were more like the histories and circumstances found in the \u201cnonvariant\u201d cases, than those found in the variant cases. Therefore, the Board concluded that appellant\u2019s sentence was \u201cdisparate\u201d and brought its motion to recall appellant\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>\n<em>The Legal Effect of a Section 1170, Subdivision (f) Motion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">We first deal with appellant\u2019s contention that the Board\u2019s finding of \u201cdisparity\u201d creates a rebuttable presumption that the sentence is \u201cincorrect\u201d and should be recalled.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">Appellant cites no authority to support this construction of section 1170, subdivision (f). The statute makes no reference to presumptions of any kind. It merely states that the Board shall \u201c[i]n all cases ... review the sentence and shall by motion <em>recommend </em>that the court recall the sentence and commitment previously ordered and resentence the defendant ... if the board determines the sentence is disparate.\u201d (\u00a7 1170, subd. (f), italics added.) The statute provides no guidance as to what procedure should be followed in hearing the motion, nor does it require the trial judge to make findings of any kind in ruling on the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">The Legislature is well aware that it can require the judge to follow a specific procedure or to make findings through the use of appropriate statutory language. For example, section 1170, subdivision (b) essentially creates a presumption in favor of imposing the middle of three possible terms since the statute requires the presence of additional factors for imposition of either the highest or lowest term. The absence of similar language in section 1170, subdivision (f) indicates that the Legislature did not intend the motion to create a presumption in favor of recall.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">We also note that a finding by the Board that a sentence is \u201cdisparate\u201d does not mean that the sentence was imposed in violation of the law. Therefore, even were we to conclude that the Board\u2019s determination was conclusive on the issue of whether a given sentence was disparate, this would not indicate that the sentence is \u201cincorrect,\u201d if by \u201cincorrect\u201d appellant means \u201cunlawful.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b418-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>In view of this analysis, we find that a motion brought by the Board pursuant to section 1170, subdivision (f) does not create a presumption that the sentence is \u201cincorrect\u201d (unlawful) or that the prisoner is entitled to have his sentence recalled.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">Although respondent is correct in its first contention that a section 1170, subdivision (f) motion does not create a presumption in favor of resentencing, its second contention\u2014that there is no burden which must be met to deny the motion\u2014would, if supported by this court, rob the review procedure under section 1170, subdivision (f) of its clearly intended impact: to eliminate disparity among sentences and to promote uniformity of sentences. Indeed, elimination of disparity among sentences is the predominant policy underlying the entire DSL. (\u00a7 1170, subd. (a)(1); see also \u00a7\u00a7 1170.1, subds. (a), (d), and (f) which contain sentencing rules designed to promote uniformity of sentencing.)</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">The apparent intent of the Legislature in authorizing the review procedure under section 1170, subdivision (f) was to inform the trial judge that a sentence he or she imposed may be \u201cdisparate,\u201d and therefore contrary to the major purpose of the DSL. The Board provides sentencing courts with information unavailable from any other source about similar cases and the sentences actually imposed in those cases. It does so to implement the DSL\u2019s strong policy in favor of uniformity of sentences for those convicted of similar crimes under similar circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">The Board argues in its amicus brief that its determination that a sentence is disparate is entitled to great weight. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">The Board has been charged under section 1170, subdivision (f) with identifying \u201cdisparate\u201d sentences. It has chosen to do this by undertaking the analysis described earlier in this opinion. In essence, the Board has construed a \u201cdisparate\u201d sentence to be a sentence which is identified as disparate by that analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">The construction of a statute by the officials charged with its administration, although not controlling, is entitled to great weight. <em>(Carmona </em>v. <em>Division of Industrial Safety </em>(1975) 13 Cal.3d 303, 310 [118 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>Cal.Rptr. 473, 530 P.2d 161]; <em>Whitcomb Hotel, Inc. </em>v. <em>Cal. Emp. Com. </em>(1944) 24 Cal.2d 753, 756-757 [151 P.2d 233, 155 A.L.R. 405]; <em>County of Los Angeles </em>v. <em>Frisbie </em>(1942) 19 Cal.2d 634, 643 [122 P.2d 526].) Therefore, since it is essentially construing the meaning of the term \u201cdisparate\u201d as used in section 1170, subdivision (f), the Board\u2019s determination that a sentence is disparate is entitled to serious consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">In determining the merits of a motion brought under section 1170, subdivision (f), a trial court must undertake a two-part analysis; First, it must determine whether the sentence imposed was indeed disparate. Secondly, if the court finds that the sentence is disparate, this fact must be given great weight in the court\u2019s decision whether or not to recall the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">Unfortunately, even though the term has been frequently used in the case law, no California case has defined the meaning of \u201cgreat weight\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">For the purposes of a motion brought pursuant to section 1170, subdivision (f), a trial court will have met its obligation of according the Board\u2019s finding of disparity \u201cgreat weight\u201d in the first part of the analysis described above, if the record shows that the court seriously considered the information provided by the Board, and attempted to discern whether, when compared to sentences imposed by his colleagues, the sentence he imposed in the case under review was \u201cdisparate.\u201d The judge is not required to make findings as to why he disagrees with the Board\u2019s determination that a sentence is disparate; however, as a practical matter, a judge will want the record to show the precise reason he disagreed with the Board\u2019s finding, as this will provide evidence that he undertook the inquiry necessary to meet the great weight standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">If, after giving serious consideration to the Board\u2019s finding, a judge finds that the sentence he imposed was not disparate no further inquiry is necessary and the judge may deny the motion. On the other hand, if the judge agrees with the Board\u2019s finding that the sentence imposed was disparate, he is required to undertake the second part of the analysis described above.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-9\">The procedure that must be undertaken to meet the \u201cgreat weight\u201d standard in the second part of the analysis does not lend itself to easy description or definition. Typically, however, it would require that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>judge question the \u201cobserved sentencing pattern\u201d relied on by the Board. Even though the judge may agree that the sentence he imposed does not conform to the \u201cobserved sentencing pattern\u201d relied on by the Board (and is therefore disparate), he may question the underlying rationale of the sentencing pattern practiced by the majority of his colleagues. In other words, observed sentencing patterns should be treated as guidelines to help promote uniformity of sentencing; they should not function as immutable rules which place judicial discretion in a straight jacket.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">The final issue to be resolved in this case is whether the trial judge accorded great weight to the Board\u2019s finding of disparity.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">The judge below conducted a full hearing on the Board\u2019s motion. This hearing supplemented the lengthy briefs already filed in support of and in opposition to the motion. The appellant, the respondent and the Board were represented by counsel at the hearing, and each party was given an opportunity to present its position regarding the motion. An operations research specialist for the Board was called as a witness, was subjected to voir dire examination by the court and was also examined by both respondent\u2019s and the Board\u2019s counsels. The transcript of this proceeding gives every indication that the trial judge seriously considered the information provided by the Board and attempted to discern whether the sentence he had imposed was indeed disparate.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">Furthermore, the decision to deny the motion was based on the trial court\u2019s specific finding that the sentence it had imposed was not disparate. This finding was in turn supported by specifically enumerated reasons. These reasons included; (1) The fact that the sentence actually imposed was that suggested by the probation department; (2) the appellant\u2019s extensive criminal history; and (3) the questionable criteria the Board used to distinguish \u201cdisparate\u201d from \u201cvariant\u201d sentences.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>The record indicates that the judge below, although disagreeing with the Board\u2019s finding of disparity, nonetheless accorded that finding great weight. Since the judge found that the sentence he imposed was <em>not </em>disparate, he was not required to undertake the second part of the analysis described above.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">The trial court\u2019s denial of the Board\u2019s motion is affirmed. The eight-month enhancement imposed in count IV for use of a firearm is stricken and the sentence modified accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">Taylor, P. J., and Smith, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">Appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied April 1, 1982.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b412-7\"> All references to code sections will refer to the Penal Code unless otherwise indicated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b412-8\"> The five counts against appellant involved five victims in two separate incidents. Both incidents occurred on the same night but in separate locations. Three victims were involved in the first incident, and two victims in the later incident. The court imposed consecutive sentences for counts based on separate incidents, as well as for counts based on separate victims within the same incident.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b412-9\"> Section 1170, subdivision (f) provides: \u201c(f) In all cases the Board of Prison Terms shall not later than one year after the commencement of the term of imprisonment, review the sentence and shall by motion recommend that the court recall the sentence and commitment previously ordered and resentence the defendant in the same manner as if he had not been previously sentenced if the board determines the sentence is disparate. The review under this section shall concern the decision to deny probation and the sentencing decisions enumerated in subdivisions (b), (c), (d) and (e) of Section 1170.3 and apply the sentencing rules of the Judicial Council and the information regarding the sentences in this state of other persons convicted of similar crimes so as to eliminate disparity of sentences and to promote uniformity of sentencing.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b413-10\"> Respondent has also requested that this court \u201cenunciate a rule of criminal procedure\u201d which would require that a court wait until a case had reached appellate finality before it could adjudicate a section 1170, subdivision (f) motion, unless the delay would prejudice a prisoner\u2019s opportunity to have his sentence reduced. However, the record indicates that this issue was not raised below and the question is therefore not properly before the court. For this reason we decline to rule on the issue. <em>(Dimmick </em>v. <em>Dimmick </em>(1962) 58 Cal.2d 417, 422-423 [24 Cal.Rptr. 856, 374 P.2d 824]; <em>Dunn </em>v. <em>Dunn </em>(1960) 180 Cal.App.2d 839, 841-842 [4 Cal.Rptr. 748].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b417-9\"> However, a portion of appellant\u2019s sentence was clearly imposed in violation of the law. Appellant argues and respondent concedes that the trial court added a consecutive term of one year and eight months for count IV. The one-year enhancement derived from the imposition of a consecutive term for robbery. The eight additional months were imposed because of the finding in count IV that appellant had used a firearm within the meaning of section 12022.5.</p>\n<p id=\"AZu\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Harvey </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 754 [159 Cal.Rptr. 696, 602 P.2d 396] (decided after sentencing in this case) the Supreme Court held that no enhancement could be imposed for use of a firearm in a subordinate count unless the underlying offense was listed in section 667.5, subdivision (c). Since robbery was not one of the offenses listed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>in that section at the time of sentencing, it was improper to impose a consecutive term for firearm use.</p>\n<p id=\"AgfN\">Therefore, the eight-month enhancement imposed in count IV for use of a firearm (\u00a7 12022.5) must be stricken and the sentence modified accordingly.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b420-7\"> One specific criterion the trial judge questioned was the use of \u201covert threats\u201d as an aggravating factor justifying a \u201cvariant\u201d sentence. The term \u201covert threat\u201d was defined by the Board\u2019s counsel as a <em>spoken </em>threat.</p>\n<p id=\"AWv\">The judge\u2019s criticism of the use of this factor as an aggravating circumstance should be taken to heart by the Board. It is difficult to imagine why a criminal who points a gun at a robbery victim (thereby indicating through nonverbal communication that he intends to do serious harm to the victim if his instructions are not quickly followed) should be subject to a less severe sentence than a criminal who bolsters this already crystal clear message with a superfluous spoken threat in the order of \u201chand over your money or I\u2019ll fill you full of lead.\u201d The spoken words add nothing to the message and therefore should add nothing to the sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
