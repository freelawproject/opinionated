J.</author>\n<p id=\"b233-10\">Statement of the Case</p>\n<p id=\"b233-11\">This is an appeal from a judgment of the superior court ordering a remand of respondent\u2019s claim for refund of real property taxes to the Fresno County Board of Supervisors sitting as a board of equalization. The judgment specified certain evidentiary errors committed by the board at the equalization hearing and found that respondent had presented a prima facie case of overassessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-12\">During the equalization hearing, respondent (referred to herein in the singular) was prevented from presenting certain evidence because of its asserted irrelevancy or because it was not exchanged with the assessor before the hearing. The board ultimately found respondent had failed to present a prima facie case. Respondent\u2019s application for a reduction in assessment valuations and claim for refund of taxes paid under protest were denied without the county assessor having to present any evidence of a proper assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-13\">Respondent sought relief in the superior court by a complaint for refund of taxes. After reviewing the record of equalization hearing, the court found that respondent should have been permitted to introduce evidence on the following matters:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>1. Soil and water conditions underlying the Noble vineyard.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-4\">2. Quality of the Noble vineyard and grapes produced therefrom.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-5\">3. 1976 crop year production and sales data for the purpose of corroborating the testimony of respondent\u2019s witnesses Sarabian and Miles.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-6\">4. Assessed values determined by the county assessor with respect to living and nonliving improvements for the purpose of illustrating the manner in which respondent determined the capitalization rate to be applied to income.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-7\">5. Whether or not the respondent had available the option of leasing the Noble vineyard during the 1975 crop year.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">The trial court then ruled that Revenue and Taxation Code section 1606, which provides for an exchange of information between the taxpayer and the assessor, is \u201cessentially a discovery measure and should be liberally construed.\u201d In addition, the court held that a prima facie case of overassessment had been presented. The action was remanded back to the board for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-9\">The Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b234-10\">The respondents are duly qualified, appointed and acting co-executors of the will of William H. Noble, deceased. Among the assets of the Noble estate are 12 parcels of property comprising some 5,000 acres in western Fresno County planted primarily to varietal grapes. Each of the parcels is contractually restricted to agricultural use pursuant to the California Land Conservation Act, commonly known as the Williamson Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-11\">Because the final plantings of grapevines on the subject property took place in 1972, the assessor did not have an opportunity to assess the property as fully improved with the vines until the lien date in 1976.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This assessment resulted in a 52 percent increase in the assessed value. Respondent paid the increased taxes under protest and filed timely applications for equalization hearings for each of the 12 parcels. The Fresno County Board of Supervisors, acting as a board of equalization <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>under section 1601 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, held a hearing on the applications on April 13 and 14, 1977.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\">Respondent\u2019s counsel in opening statement alluded to the income received from the property in question during 1976. Counsel for the appellant promptly objected arguing that no data later than 90 days after the lien date should be considered. The board sustained the objection. Counsel for the respondent attempted to point out that the board was considering capitalization of income rather than fair market value, and further that information as to subsequent earnings was material in determining the long term income expected from the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">Respondent produced three witnesses at the hearing, Mr. Robert L. Smith, Mr. Sarkis Sarabian and Mr. James Miles. Smith, the co-executor of the estate and manager of the Noble Land and Cattle Company, testified first. He had managed the Noble estate and its predecessor for 20 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">Smith testified that the 12 parcels in question constituted 5,000 acres of vineyard of which 175 acres were planted to Thompson seedless grapes with the balance planted to varietal wine grapes. Varietal grapes, unlike Thompson seedless grapes, can only be used in wine making; they cannot be sold as table grapes or made into raisins.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">Smith further testified that the grapes were sold in a commercially reasonable manner for the highest and best price available, but the Noble estate still suffered a net operating loss of $47.44 per acre. Even if the estate had been able to secure the higher prices quoted by the Federal State Market News Service, it still would have suffered a net loss of $18.94 per acre. Thus, Smith concluded that despite prudent management, the subject property could not have been operated at a profit during the period in question. According to Smith, the market for varietal grapes in 1975 was depressed because of an oversupply. The market for Thompson seedless grapes was better since they had alternative uses.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">Smith attempted to testify on the condition of the estate\u2019s soil and water. Appellant\u2019s counsel objected, arguing that this evidence was never presented to appellant in the exchange under section 1606. The basis of the objection, which was sustained, was that although production figures were provided on the productivity of the Noble estate, there was no textual discussion of productivity or soil and water conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>Smith also attempted to estimate the rental value of the subject property. A lengthy debate ensued. Eventually, Smith did testify that the rental value of open land with pipelines was $75 per acre.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">Respondent\u2019s second witness was Mr. Sarkis Sarabian, a highly qualified agricultural consultant. He confirmed Smith\u2019s testimony that the production costs on the subject property were reasonable and that the highest and best prices available were obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">Sarabian testified that the conditions responsible for the losses in 1975 had continued unabated into the next year. He noted that many growers of varietal grapes had suffered problems and that approximately 14,000 acres of such grapes had been pulled and destroyed between the end of the 1975 harvest season and the lien date of 1976. No long term contracts were available for varietal growers in 1975. Because of their alternative uses, Thompson seedless growers were able to obtain higher prices than varietal growers.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">Sarabian attempted to testify on the soil, water and related conditions of the Noble estate along with the quality of the grapes grown. This evidence again was excluded because the board concluded there was nothing presented in the exchange of information relating to such evidence except for a letter identifying Sarabian as a witness who would give testimony on respondent\u2019s \u201cvineyard operations including, without limitation, soil and water conditions, viticulture practices, crop yields, [etc.] . .. .\u201d Sarabian also attempted to testify about the possibility of leasing Noble\u2019s vineyards during the 1975 year but a relevancy objection was sustained. Sarabian concluded by stating that during the crop year of 1975 the Noble vineyards could not have been operated at a profit.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">Respondent\u2019s third witness was Mr. James Miles, an agricultural appraiser and consultant. Miles agreed with Smith\u2019s and Sarabian\u2019s testimony that the Noble estate had received the best prices possible for its grapes. He discussed the depressed condition of the varietal grape industry which was caused by substantial overplanting in 1972 and 1973.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">Miles also testified concerning comparable <em>leases </em>and comparable <em>sales </em>utilized by the assessor in determining the value of the subject property. His conclusion was that the use of this data was inappropriate. He noted that most of the <em>leased </em>land utilized by the assessor as an index of value was open cropland while the remainder was planted sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>stantially with Thompson seedless rather than varietal grapes. Miles opined that leases of Thompson seedless vineyards were not comparable to leases of varietal vineyards because of the multiple uses of Thompson seedless grapes. He also pointed out that in recent years the price of Thompson seedless had been high due to the demand for raisins.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">In addition, Miles disagreed with the type of properties deemed to be comparable <em>sales </em>by the assessor. Over 50 percent of the land involved was open cropland while the remainder was planted primarily to Thompson seedless grapes. Out of 1,733 arable acres in the assessor\u2019s <em>sales </em>computation, only 7 acres were planted in varietal grapes.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">Miles, however, admitted there are two steps involved in appraising land subject to the Williamson Act. It is first necessary to establish the value of open land without any living improvements and then the value of land with living improvements, i.e., the vines. The capitalized value of the bare land constitutes the minimum value of the land, and it was proper for the assessor to use leases of bare land to establish that minimal value. It was also proper for the assessor to use the leases and sales data on Thompson ranches and bare land to establish a rate of return attributable to nonliving improvements such as pumps, wells, wire, grapestakes, etc. Miles did not know how the assessor used the lease and sale information in assessing the Noble properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">There was a second round of testimony from Smith. Counsel for the appellant then argued that respondent had failed to present a prima facie case because there had only been testimony on a single year\u2019s profit and loss, which was insignificant evidence of an income stream over time, and further that respondent had not presented an independent capitalization rate. A debate ensued between opposing counsel with the board ultimately concluding that for those two reasons a prima facie case had not been presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">\n<em>The Exchange of Information Under Revenue and Taxation Code Section 1606 and Other Evidentiary Rulings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">At the time of the equalization hearing, Revenue and Taxation Code section 1606, subdivision (a) provided in pertinent part: \u201c(a) At the time of filing the application or at any time prior to 20 days before the commencement of the hearing on the application, any applicant for a change of an assessment on the local roll or the assessor, in those cases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>where the assessed value of the property involved, as shown on the current assessment roll exceeds twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000) [now $100,000] without regard to any exemptions, may cause an exchange of information between himself and the other party by submitting the following data to the other party in writing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-4\">\u201c(1) Information stating the basis of such party\u2019s opinion of value.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-5\">\u201c(3) When the opinion of value is to be supported with evidence based on an income study, information relating to income, expenses and the capitalization method.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">Section 1606, subdivision (b) limits the scope of the evidence that may be introduced at the hearing: \u201cWhenever information has been exchanged pursuant to this section the parties may not introduce evidence on matters not so exchanged unless the other party consents to such introduction. However, at the hearing, each party may introduce new material relating to the information received from the other party. If a party introduces new material at the hearing, the other party, upon his request, shall be granted a continuance for a reasonable period of time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">The record shows that two items of evidence were excluded on the basis that they had not been exchanged with the assessor prior to the hearing. The excluded evidence pertained to the soil and water conditions of the Noble vineyards and the quality of the vines and grapes produced therefrom. Appellant convinced the board that since respondent had not exchanged any information directly relating to the evidence sought to be introduced, Revenue and Taxation Code section 1606, subdivision (b) barred the admission of such evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">Prior to the hearing before the board, respondent initiated discovery pursuant to section 1606. Respondent submitted to the assessor detailed documentation relating to production and expenses and also submitted a resume of the testimony they intended to present to the board through their witness Sarkis Sarabian. The assessor was informed that Sarabian would: \u201cgive testimony with respect to all phases of applicant\u2019s vineyard operations including, without limitation, <em>soil and water conditions, </em>viticulture practices, <em>crop yields, </em>revenues, pre-harvest and harvest expenses, market conditions for varietal grapes in 1975, and expected market conditions as of March 1, 1976, and the extent to which there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>was generally available from wineries in 1975 long-term marketing contracts covering varietal grapes.\u201d (Italics added.) Respondent further advised the assessor that the vineyard\u2019s poor yield history had been caused by \u201cinferior water and soil conditions which have simply not been properly evaluated.\u201d Respondent invited the assessor to solicit further information stating: \u201cWe wish to be as cooperative as possible in assisting your office in analyzing the documents which we have submitted. Accordingly, if you feel that any explanations would be of assistance or you believe that additional data would be helpful to further support applicant\u2019s conclusions as to restricted values, please contact either the undersigned or applicant\u2019s representative, Robert L. Smith.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">In spite of the foregoing, appellant\u2019s counsel objected when Smith and Sarabian attempted to testify on the soil and water conditions of the subject property. The theory of appellant\u2019s counsel was that to present testimony on these subjects, respondent had to submit a detailed analysis of any studies made by respondent\u2019s witnesses on the soil and water conditions. In other words, unless the taxpayer who initiates an exchange gives the assessor all the information in the taxpayer\u2019s possession directly relating to the evidence sought to be introduced at the hearing, the statute bars introduction of any testimony on the subject. We believe appellant\u2019s interpretation of the meaning of section 1606 is unduly restrictive and violates the legislative purpose behind the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\"> As the assessor argued in <em>Henderson </em>v. <em>Bettis </em>(1975) 53 Cal.App.3d 486 at page 492 [126 Cal.Rptr. 199], the equalization process is a true adversary proceeding and Revenue and Taxation Code section 1606 is a <em>discovery </em>device created by the Legislature to promote a fair and effective equalization process and to take the \u201cgame\u201d and element of surprise out of the proceedings. (See <em>Greyhound Corp. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1961) 56 Cal.2d 355, 376 [15 Cal.Rptr. 90, 364 P.2d 266].)</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">The two statutes allowing a form of discovery in real property assessment disputes are Revenue and Taxation Code section 408 and the section in question, 1606. (These sections are discussed in <em>Henderson </em>v. <em>Bettis, supra, </em>53 Cal.App.3d 486.) Section 408<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> is used by the taxpay<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>ers to obtain any information the assessor has relating to the appraisal and assessment of taxpayers\u2019 property so long as it does not relate to the property or business affairs of another. This <em>is not an exchange </em>of information since the assessor cannot compel the taxpayer to disclose his market data unless the assessed value exceeds $25,000 (today $100,000)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> thereby triggering section 1606. The assessor, however, only must disclose data relating to comparable sales <em>(id., </em>at p. 493).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">The scope of required disclosure is much broader under section 1606, but use of the statute triggers a <em>mutual exchange </em>of information. Either party may obtain from the other information stating the basis of the party\u2019s opinion of value. Disclosure includes, if pertinent, income or replacement costs in addition to comparable sales. The taxpayer has the option of invoking either section 408 or section 1606 while the assessor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>cannot use section 408 and can only invoke section 1606 if the assessed value exceeds $25,000. <em>(Ibid.) </em>As pointed out by the <em>Henderson </em>court, this protaxpayer statutory scheme is equitable since the assessor enjoys a superior advantage. The law presumes assessments are correct, and board of equalization decisions which adopt the assessor\u2019s position are protected by the substantial evidence rule. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 494-495; <em>Westlake Farms, Inc. </em>v. <em>County of Kings </em>(1974) 39 Cal.App.3d 179, 183, 186-187 [114 Cal.Rptr. 317].)</p>\n<p id=\"b241-3\">Accepting appellant\u2019s argument that section 1606 requires a very detailed exchange of information flies in the face of the protaxpayer intent expressed by the Legislature in setting up the above. statutory scheme. The scheme starts out protaxpayer since the assessor cannot receive <em>any </em>information from the taxpayer unless the assessment exceeds $25,000. It is unreasonable to conclude that this statutory scheme starts out as protaxpayer and ends by requiring the taxpayer to set forth in minute detail the evidence that he intends to present at the hearing. Such a requirement would also eliminate much of the need to hold an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">Importantly, the equalization \u201chearing need not be conducted according to technical rules relating to evidence and witnesses.\u201d (Rev. &amp; Tax. Code, \u00a7 1609; see 51 Cal.Jur.3d, Property Taxes, \u00a7 115, p. 239.) \u201c[The board] may admit and act on any evidence that has a direct bearing on the question before it or <em>tends </em>to prove the fact in issue.\u201d (51 Cal.Jur.3d, Property Taxes, \u00a7 115, p. 239, italics added.)  We should give a reasonable and common sense interpretation to section 1606. If the exchange of information provides reasonable notice to the opposition concerning the subject matter to be presented at the hearing through the testimony of witnesses and evidence, the statute has been complied with. The purpose of the exchange of information has been satisfied. We perceive no requirement that the details of the evidence to be introduced must be exchanged. In the present case, the assessor was advised that respondent would offer evidence as to the poor water and soil conditions of the property. Thus, the assessor had no basis for objecting to the proffered testimony of Smith and Sarabian on this subject.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>The evidence supporting the right to present the excluded testimony on the quality of the Noble vineyard and grapes is more tenuous. Nevertheless, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in ruling such testimony admissible. Although the assessor was not expressly notified that respondent\u2019s witnesses would testify to the vine and grape quality, the assessor was notified there would be testimony on the subject of \u201ccrop yields\u201d for the 1975 season. If respondent\u2019s witnesses could testify as to the poor production in 1975, they could offer their opinion on the reasons for the poor production, i.e., whether caused by insects, the poor quality of the vines, etc. Thus, the board erred in excluding the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">Nor can we find the trial court erred in ruling that respondent should have been able to present evidence concerning the 1976 crop year production and sales revenue to corroborate the testimony of Sarabian and Miles. The evidence was excluded on the ground of irrelevancy, i.e., that no data later than 90 days after the lien date should be considered in arriving at the value of the property on the lien date. (See Rev. &amp; Tax. Code, \u00a7 402.5.) However, a rule which is restricted to fair market value assessments should not apply to a capitalization income situation. \u201cRelevant evidence\u201d means evidence upon which responsible persons are accustomed to rely in the conduct of serious affairs; i.e., any evidence having any tendency in reason to prove or disprove any disputed fact that is of consequence to the action, including evidence relevant to the credibility of a witness. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 210; Rev. &amp; Tax. Code, \u00a7 1609.) In hindsight, the 1976 production returns would have some bearing on the income <em>potential </em>of the property as of March 1, 1976, and would tend to corroborate the testimony of Smith and Sarabian concerning the poor quality of the soil, water and vines.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">The trial court\u2019s finding that respondent should have been permitted to introduce evidence of the assessor\u2019s values \u201cwith respect to living and nonliving improvements for the purpose of illustrating the manner in which plaintiff determined the capitalization rate to be applied to income\u201d (finding 10(c)) is, however, another matter. As noted by appellant, the finding is unintelligible. If it relates to Smith\u2019s attempt to utilize the assessor\u2019s opinion of the rental value of bare unimproved land to establish a ratio of value between living and nonliving improvements, the board properly excluded the evidence. The assessor\u2019s opinion of the rental value of other land was not in evidence since the assessor had not yet commenced its case in chief. At the beginning of the hearing both sides stipulated that $75 per acre was the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>proper annual rental value of the bare unimproved land. However, the stipulation was vacated because respondent\u2019s counsel apparently misunderstood the stipulation when he sought to show that a portion of the $75 rent was applicable to nonliving improvements such as pumps, pipelines, wires, etc. Respondent, however, persisted in attempting to use the $75 per acre rental figure although there was no evidence in the record establishing it. Respondent\u2019s purpose was to show that 88 percent of the rental value of land <em>with </em>nonliving improvements is attributable to the land and 12 percent is attributable to the nonliving improvements. The 88 percent and 12 percent figures were derived by breaking down the <em>assessor\u2019s opinion </em>of the value of the bare land and the value of improvements enrolled for a different unrelated parcel.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">The board properly sustained the assessor\u2019s objection to the evidence on the grounds of improper foundation, relevancy, and presentation of an impermissible method of valuing restricted open space land. With this exception, we conclude that the board should have received respondent\u2019s offered evidence.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">\n<em>Respondent Failed to Prove a Prima Facie Case of Over-assessment Even With the Aid of the Excluded Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">The pivotal issue before this court is whether the evidence produced by respondent at the equalization hearing established a prima facie case of value under Revenue and Taxation Code section 423 and State Board of Equalization rule 52.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">Since the 12 parcels in question were included in an agricultural preserve pursuant to the Williamson Act and were subject to a binding and enforceable contract with the County of Fresno restricting use to agricultural purposes, the assessment procedures are governed by sections 423 and 429 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, rule 52 of the Board of Equalization Property Tax Rule and Regulations (tit. 18, Cal. Ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>min. Code, p. 21), and article XIII, section 3, subdivision (i) of the California Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">Article XIII, section 3, subdivision (i) of the Constitution provides that grapevines, but not the land itself, are exempt from real property taxation until three years after the season in which they are planted. This exemption recognizes that vines are not improvements until they mature since the vines return no income to pay taxes until that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">Section 423 of the Revenue and Taxation Code provides that when valuing land governed by the Williamson Act, the assessor shall not consider sales data on other lands. An alternate method of valuation, capitalization of income, is required. Section 423, subdivision (a)(1) provides that when sufficient rental information is available, the income shall be the fair rent which can be imputed to the land being valued based upon rent actually received for the land by the owner and upon typical rentals received in the area for similar land in similar use, where the owner pays the property tax.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> When sufficient rental information is not available, paragraph (2) of subdivision (a) of section 423 provides that the income shall be that which the land being valued reasonably can be expected to yield under prudent management. It was this alternate method of valuation that respondent claimed applied to the parcels of property in question. It should be noted that while rental income from restricted property is to be capitalized for assessment purposes, nonliving improvements are assessed at their fair market value.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">During the exemption period for vineyards the income to be capitalized must not be less than what the land would yield if it was planted to other typical crops grown in the area during a typical rotation period. (Rev. &amp; Tax. Code, \u00a7 423, subd. (a)(3).) Therefore, when the land is planted with vineyards during the period the vineyards are not producing the land is still taxed as if it was planted with typical annual crops. After the vineyards mature the income must not be less than the yield from the vineyards. (Rev. &amp; Tax. Code, \u00a7 429.) The assessor must capitalize the greater of (1) the net income that the land and vineyard would yield under prudent management or (2) the net income that the land should yield over a typical rotation period if planted with typical crops. (Cal. Admin. Code, tit. 18, \u00a7 52.)</p>\n<p id=\"b245-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>In valuing vineyards, the net income attributable to the vines must be estimated first and the net income attributable to the land deducted from it. The remainder is then capitalized into the vine value. The net result* however, is that the income which is attributable to the land is capitalized separately because the amortization component of the capitalization rate is excluded since it only applies to perennials and not bare land. The two value figures are then added together.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">The expenses which are deductible in arriving at net income are any ordinary and necessary charges for production and maintenance with the exclusion of depletion, debt retirement, interest on funds and taxes. When the income used is from the operating land being valued or from operating comparable land, amounts shall be excluded from the income to provide a fair return on capital investment and operating assets other than the land, to amortize appreciable property, and to fairly compensate the owner-operator for his operating and management services. (Rev. &amp; Tax. Code, \u00a7 423, subd. (a)(3).) Once the income from the restricted land has been determined, a capitalization rate <em>not </em>derived from sales data is used; the specific components are described in Revenue and Taxation Code section 423, subdivision (b). The value of the land for assessment purposes shall be the quotient for the income determined as provided by section 423, subdivision (a) divided by the capitalization rate determined as provided in subdivision (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">Although several California cases have discussed the standard of what constitutes a prima facie case of overassessment under the traditional fair market value method of assessment, the question of what constitutes a prima facie case of overassessment under the restricted use method of capitalized income required by Revenue and Taxation Code section 423 is one of first impression.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">In <em>Griffith </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles </em>(1968) 267 Cal.App.2d 837 [73 Cal.Rptr. 773], the taxpayer applied for reduction of an assessment by contending that the assessor employed an unduly high ratio in valuing the taxpayer\u2019s property under the traditional fair market value method of assessment. The court declared that the taxpayers were under an obligation to show a disparity of the ratio between that applied to the taxpayer\u2019s property and that applied to other property generally prevailing in the county. The court then stated: \u201cTo sustain his burden the taxpayer must at least make a prima facie showing in this regard. That is, he must introduce <em>some evidence </em>of the <em>assessment inequality </em>before there is any burden on the assessor. Without this prima facie showing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>the assessor is not obliged to go forward with any evidence. He may stand on his presumption that the assessment is fair and equitable.\u201d (267 Cal.App.2d at p. 842, italics added.) Subsequent cases have reiterated the standard promulgated in <em>Griffith (Campbell Chain Co. </em>v. <em>County of Alameda </em>(1970) 12 Cal.App.3d 248, 258 [90 Cal.Rptr. 501]; see <em>Glidden Company </em>v. <em>County of Alameda </em>(1970) 5 Cal.App.3d 371, 383 [85 Cal.Rptr. 88, 86 Cal.Rptr. 464]).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">The law presumes the assessor has properly performed his duty and has assessed all properties fairly and upon an equal basis. The effect of this presumption is to impose on the applicant the burden of proving that the property in question has not been correctly assessed. Thus, the law requires the taxpayer \u201cestablish the full value of the property by independent evidence.\u201d (Rev. &amp; Tax. Code, \u00a7 1610.8; Cal. Admin. Code, tit. 18, \u00a7 321, subd. (a).) \u201c[I]f the applicant fails to present evidence of <em>value </em>of the property, the presumption set forth in section 321(a) applies and the board shall not require the assessor to present his case.\u201d (Italics added, Cal. Admin. Code, tit. 18, \u00a7 313, subd. (c).)</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">We conclude that a prima facie case of overassessment of restricted open space land under the capitalization of income method requires the taxpayer to offer independent proof of the capitalized income value of the land as defined in Revenue and Taxation Code section 423. This requires evidence of projected annual income and expenses from the property together with a capitalization rate to be used in determining the value of the land. (If the taxpayer wishes to adopt the capitalization rate used by the assessor, he should be able to do so by stipulation or by offering the assessor\u2019s records into evidence.)</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">We turn now to the evidence presented by respondent at the equalization hearing. For the most part respondent\u2019s case consisted of showing that 1975 was a bad crop year. Because of tremendous overplanting of varietal grapes in previous years, there was a glut in the market. Respondent suffered a net operating loss of $47 per acre for the crop year 1975 even though the grapes were sold at the best price available. The picture did not change during the 1976 year. The evidence showed that some 14,000 acres of varietal vines were pulled out of production after the 1975 season and before the March 1, 1976, lien date.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">Respondent was unable to rent the Noble properties during 1975 because of the large holdings of varietal grapes.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>Owners of varietal vineyards were substantially worse off than the owners of Thompson vineyards because the Thompson can be put to several uses in addition to wine making, i.e., raisins and table grapes.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">The soil and water conditions at the subject property together with the poor quality of some of the vines caused the below average production. None of the property was listed as \u201cclass I\u201d agricultural land.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">However, none of respondent\u2019s witnesses testified that the glut of grapes on the market in 1975 would continue into the future. Furthermore, the record is remarkably devoid of any testimony concerning the effect of pulling 14,000 acres of varietal grapes out of production in 1975. It can only be assumed that such activity would have a strong impact in the future on the varietal grape market, i.e., that the laws of supply and demand would eventually stabilize the market and produce a reasonable return to respondent,on the production of varietal grapes.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">Respondent failed to offer any testimony of the \u201cestimated annual net income\u201d of the property over the life of the perennials as required by Revenue and Taxation Code section 423 and rule 52 (Cal. Admin. Code, tit. 18, \u00a7 52, p. 23-25). In substance respondent\u2019s position before the board was that because they lost money in the production of grapes during 1975 and 1976, they would of necessity continue to lose money in the foreseeable future. In other words, the planting of the vines did not increase the value of the land beyond what it was worth as bare land plus nonliving improvements. While this may be true in the short term, it is unrealistic to believe the situation would not change. In any event, for a prima facie case respondent must present some evidence of projected <em>future </em>income and expenses and not just evidence of past losses.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">The capitalization of income approach to value is described in State Board of Equalization rule 8(c) (Cal. Admin. Code, tit. 18, \u00a7 8, subd. (c)): \u201cThe amount to be capitalized is the net return which a reasonably well informed owner and reasonably well informed buyers may anticipate on the lien date that the taxable property existing on that date will yield under prudent management and subject to such legally enforceable restrictions as such persons may foresee as of that date.\u201d Rule 8(c) is based on the Supreme Court\u2019s landmark decision in <em>De Luz Homes, Inc. </em>v. <em>County of San Diego </em>(1955) 45 Cal.2d 546, 564-566 [290 P.2d 544]. \u201c... the value of the property is the sum of anticipated future installments of net income from the property, ...</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>\u201cThe first step in the process is to determine prospective net income and this is done by estimating future gross income and deducting therefrom expected necessary expenses ....</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">\u201cThe net earnings to be capitalized, therefore, are not those of the present owner of the property, but those that would be anticipated by a prospective purchaser. \u2018Anticipated future earning power is the <em>sole </em>matter of consequence, since reported earnings are already water under the mill.\u2019 ... it is clear that whatever may be the rationale of the property tax, it is not the profitableness of the property to its present owner.\u201d See also <em>Clayton </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles </em>(1972) 26 Cal.App.3d 390, 395 [102 Cal.Rptr. 687], wherein the court held that \u201ceconomic rent,\" not actual rental income, is the key to value; <em>California Portland Cement Co. </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Equalization </em>(1967) 67 Cal.2d 578, 583 [63 Cal.Rptr. 5, 432 P.2d 700], in which the Supreme Court reiterated that \u201canticipated income is the basis for an estimate of property value under the capitalized earning ability approach\u201d; and <em>County of Riverside </em>v. <em>Palm-Ramon Development Co. </em>(1965) 63 Cal.2d 534 [47 Cal.Rptr. 377, 407 P.2d 289].</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">Respondent strenuously argues that he presented evidence of over-assessment of the Noble vineyards through James Miles who testified that in his opinion the so-called comparable leases and sales utilized by the assessor in determining the value of the subject property were improper, i.e., the sales and leases were in fact not comparable to the subject property. He noted that most of the leased land utilized by the assessor was planted substantially with Thompson seedless grapes rather than varietal. He pointed out that not only could the Thompsons be put to multiple uses, but in recent years their price had been high due to the demand for raisins. Miles\u2019 disagreement over the nature of the properties deemed to be comparable sales by the assessor was based on the fact that more than 50 percent of the land involved was open cropland while the remainder was planted primarily with Thompson seedless grapes. Out of 1,733 arable acres in the assessor\u2019s sales computation, only 7 acres were planted to varietals.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">However, on cross-examination, Miles acknowledged there are two steps involved in appraising land subject to the Williamson Act. It is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>first necessary to establish the value of open land without any living improvements and then the value of land with improvements. The capitalized value of the bare land constitutes the minimum value of the land, and it was proper for the assessor to use leases of bare land to establish that minimum value. It was also proper for the assessor to use leases and sales data on Thompson vineyards to establish a rate of return attributable to nonliving improvements such as buildings, pumps, well, pipelines, stakes and wires. Miles nevertheless opined that it would be improper for the assessor to use sales and leases of Thompson vineyards in determining the income potential of a varietal vineyard.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">Miles\u2019 testimony does not show how the assessor used the comparable sales and lease information in connection with the Noble properties. Nor does Miles\u2019 testimony show the assessor used the income from Thompson vineyards to project an income figure for the subject properties to be capitalized.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">Although the appellant\u2019s counsel offered on three occasions to permit the assessor\u2019s records to be received in evidence, counsel for respondent refused the offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">Respondent failed to present evidence to the board from which a reasonable person could project a future income stream for the subject property. No evidence was presented on the projected price of the varietal grapes five, ten and fifteen years down the road. No testimony concerning projected future expenses was presented. As argued by appellant, it would be impossible for the board of equalization to have established a value for 5,000 acres of vineyard based on the evidence produced by respondent. Respondent\u2019s evidence was not supplemented by the information contained in the assessor\u2019s exchange of information because respondent refused to introduce the evidence. Respondent\u2019s argument that because there was no income to capitalize in 1975 or 1976, no income could ever be expected in the future and therefore the 5,000 acres of producing grape vines had no income value, must be rejected as totally suppositious.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">In essence, we hold that to present a prima facie case of overassessment when property is assessed by the capitalization of income method, the taxpayer must present evidence of <em>projected </em>future income and expenses. The taxpayer cannot rely solely on evidence of past losses especially when such losses have been short term.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>The judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">Andreen, J., and Stone (C.

Thus, the increase merely maintained the status quo. (See Stats. 1978, ch. 1207, \u00a7\u00a7 1,2, 9, 20, p. 3872-3873, 3877, 3888-3889; Leg. Counsel\u2019s Dig. of Sen.
