In pursuance of this section, the relator applied, upon a verified petition, to, and obtained from, the supreme court a writ of certiorari to review an assessment made in 1898 by the commissioners of taxes and assessments of the city of New York upon its property, which consisted of two pieces of real estate, and certain appliances used by it in generating electricity and in furnishing electric lights. In its petition it alleged that the assessment was illegal and erroneous, because its property was \u00e1ssessed at an overvaluation, and also because the assessment was unequal, in that its property was assessed at a higher proportionate valuation than other real estate (many instances of which were given) on the same roll and for the same year; that its property was assessed at $89,000, instead of $14,644, which was the full value, and at more than it would sell for under ordinary circumstances, and that, by reason of such inequality and overvaluation, the relator would be injured; that an application had been made, in the manner provided by law, to the commissioners of taxes and assessments for a reduction, and that its application was denied. The respondents, in their return to the writ, alleged that the assessment was duly and legally made; that the relator applied for a reduction of its assessment, and, for the purpose of procuring the same, it furnished a written statement as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>to the value of its property, and that this statement showed that the original cost of the property assessed at $89,000 was upward of $180,000, and that the income therefrom during the year preceding the time the assessment was made was more than $61,000; and as to the statement that the assessment was unequal, \u201cin that it was made at a higher proportionate valuation than other real estate on the same roll,\u201d they certified and returned, \u201cupon information and belief, that each and every of such statements is untrue.\u201d The issue formed by the petition for, and the return to, the writ came on for trial, and on the opening, and before any evidence had been taken, the learned justice at special term, notwithstanding the relator requested that evidence be then taken or else a referee be appointed for that purpose, dismissed the proceeding, and the relator has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">We are of the opinion that the appeal is well taken. The court could not thus summarily dispose of the matter. A question of fact was presented, both as to the overvaluation of the relator\u2019s property and the inequality of the assessment, which question the relator had a legal right to have determined from such evidence as it and the respondents might produce. This is precisely the right which the statute gave him. The tax law provides (Laws 1896, c. 908, \u00a7 253):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-6\">\u201cIf upon the hearing it shall appear to the court that testimony is necessary for the proper disposition of the matter, it may take evidence or may appoint a referee to take such evidence as it may direct, and report the same to the court, with his findings of fact and conclusions of law, which shall constitute a part of the proceedings upon which the determination of the court shall be made.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">The statute, while permissive in form, is nevertheless mandatory. It provides for the doing of an act for the sake of justice, and for that end clothes a public officer with power, the exercise of which concerns the interest of individuals, and, although the language is permissive, it must be construed as mandatory. People v. Board of Sup\u2019rs of Otsego Co., 51 N. Y. 401. Under it the court has no option, when it is \u201cnecessary for the proper disposition of the matter,\u201d except to determine whether it will take the evidence itself or appoint a referee to do so for it. In all cases of this character, where an issue of fact is raised, the statute contemplates that testimony shall be taken. It was never intended by the legislature that the issues raised by the petition and the return thereto should be tried in any other way. The petition \u201cis in the nature of a pleading, and only conclusions of fact need be stated, and not the evidence necessary to support them. The statute says that the writ may be allowed on the duly-verified petition of the taxpayer, when the petition shall set forth that his assessment is unequal, in that it has been made at a higher proportionate valuation than other property on the same roll, and that he will be injured by such unequal assessment.\u201d In re Corwin, 135 N. Y. 245, 32 N. E. 16. This petition contains all the allegations required by the statute to obtain the writ. It alleges that the other assessments on the roll were made at a lower proportionate valuation than the assessment of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>relator\u2019s property, and that its assessment is not only largely in excess of the real value of the property, but is not in proportion to the basis of the valuation adopted in making other assessments. It seems to me that the petition brings the case directly within the rule laid down by Judge Andrews in People v. Carter, 109 N. Y. 576, 17 N. E. 222, which is that a relator must \u201cshow a state of facts from which a presumption justly arises that the inequality of which he complains will subject him to the payment of more than his just portion of the aggregate tax.\u201d It has long been settled that in proceedings to review assessments the return of the assessors is not conclusive. People v. Barker, 152 N. Y. 417, 46 N. E. 875; People v. Smith, 24 Hun, 66; People v. Palmer, 86 Hun, 513, 33 N. Y. Supp. 926. A judgment, therefore, such as the court at special term rendered, would be justified only when a judgment on the pleadings might properly be rendered in an action. That could only be done for the defendant when the complaint failed to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. That certainly could not be done in this case, because, as we have already seen, the petition states a violation of the statute, both as to the overvaluation and as to the inequality of the assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">The statute giving to taxpayers the right to review assessments is a wholesome and beneficial one. Its purpose \"is to prevent favoritism and partiality on the part of the assessing power, and to subject all taxable property alike to its fair, just, and proportionate share of tax. To accomplish this, it is made the duty of the court, when facts are properly presented, to review the decision of the taxing body on the merits, and that was not done in this case. The. court should have taken, or appointed a referee to take, testimony, and from that determined whether the relator was illegally assessed. The relator requested that this be done, but his request was refused, and for the error thus committed the order and judgment appealed from must be reversed, with costs, the writ reinstated, and the proceeding remitted to the special term for action according to law. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
