The answer alleges, in substance, that the note was given upon the distinct condition and understanding that the same should not be presented, or the payment thereof demanded, until a certain event had taken place, and that such event had not yet occurred. Upon the trial the defendant, against the objection and exception taken by the plaintiffs, was permitted to, and did, give proof in support of the defense pleaded; and at the close of the whole case both parties moved for the direction of a verdict, and neither asked to go to the jury. The court directed a verdict for the defendant. The judgment rendered upon the verdict having been affirmed by the general term of the city court, all controverted facts, and all inferences claimed by the defendant to arise from the evidence, must, for the purposes of the present appeal, be deemed to have been conclusively determined in favor of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-19\">For the reasons stated, plaintiffs\u2019 exception to the reception of the testimony referred to presents the only question for review on this appeal. Under the decisions of Bookstaver v. Jayne, 60 N. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>Y. 146; Juilliard v. Chaffee, 92 N. Y. 529; Reynolds v. Robinson, 110 N. Y. 654, 18 N. E. 127; and Blewitt v. Boorum, 142 N. Y. 357, 37 N. E. 119,\u2014the said testimony was clearly admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">The cases relied on by the appellants, to the effect that the terms of the note cannot be varied by paroi evidence, have no application to the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
