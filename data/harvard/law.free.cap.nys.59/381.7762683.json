Proc. \u00a7 3399, provides for enforcement of mechanics\u2019 liens against the property and person liable for the debt by an action in a court having jurisdiction in an action of contract for the amount of money due. Section 3401 provides that provisions in actions for foreclosure shall apply to actions in a court of record to enforce mechanics\u2019 liens. Section 3170 provides that an order directing service of summons, either without the city of New York or by publication, may be granted by the court or a justice thereof. <em>Held </em>that, in an action to enforce a mechanic\u2019s lien brought in the city court, the summons and complaint may be served within the state, though at a point not within the city.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b409-8\">Appeal from special term, New York county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b409-9\">Action by Edward McCann against Anna H.

Section 3399, Code Civ. Proc., provides: \u201cA mechanic\u2019s lien on real property may be enforced against such property, and against a person liable for the debt upon which the lien is founded, by an action, by the lienor, his assignee or legal representative, in a court which has jurisdiction in an action founded on a contract for a sum of money equivalent to the amount of said debt.\u201d Section 3401 provides: \u201cThe provisions of this Code relating to actions for the foreclosure \u00f3f a mortgage upon real property, and the sale, * * * apply to actions in a court of record to enforce mechanics\u2019 liens on real property, except as otherwise provided in this title.\u201d Section 3170: \u201cAn order, directing the service of a summons, either without the city of New York, or by publication, may be granted by the court, or by a justice thereof; but only in a case where a warrant of attachment has been issued, as prescribed in the last section, and personal service of the summons cannot be made, with due diligence, within that city.\u201d Thus it will be seen that, if the court cannot acquire jurisdiction by the service of a summons without the city, in an action to foreclose a mechanic\u2019s lien (this being an action in rem), there can be no meaning to section 3399 above cited, so far as this court is concerned, when a necessary defendant is not a resident of the city and cannot be served therein. County courts have limited jurisdiction as this court, although they have jurisdiction in certain actions in rem (section 340, Code Civ. Proc.), yet it has never been contended that in such an action a summons may not be served in any part of the state outside of the county in which the action was brought. By section 3404 of the Code, in an action to foreclose a mechanic\u2019s lien in a justice\u2019s or other court, not of record, the summons and complaint may be served anywhere in the state; yet it is contended here that in an action in this court, being a court of record, such service cannot be made.</p>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b409-13\">The motion should be denied.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b409-14\">Argued before FITZSIMONS, O.
