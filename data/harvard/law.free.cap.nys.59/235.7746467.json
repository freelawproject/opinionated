The trial judge so held, and therefore ordered judgment overruling the .plaintiffs\u2019 demurrer, with costs; and from the judgment entered thereon this appeal is taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-13\">The defendant is proceeding to construct a sewer through Clare avenue, in that city, in front of the plaintiffs? lands. The plaintiffs claim that the ordinance of the common council ordering such sewer, and the proceedings under which it is being constructed, are illegal and void; and this action is brought to perpetually restrain the city from taking any further proceedings for the prosecution of such work, Although the plaintiffs aver that they are the owners of lots upon such avenue, and in front of which the sewer is being constructed, they do not charge that their real estate is being invaded, or that they are in any way being injured by the work complained of, except that as such owners they are liable to be assessed for the expense of constructing the sewer. The injury which they apprehend is evidently no more than an assessment levied under those provisions of the city\u2019s charter which authorize and regulate the construction of sewers; and it is for the purpose of avoiding such assessment, only, that the perpetual injunction is asked. We are of the opinion that the judge at special term was correct in holding that, upon the facts averred in the complaint, such relief was not warranted. Ample remedies at law exist for relief against an illegal assessment for the construction of a sewer. Stebbins v. Kay, 123 N. Y. 31, 25 N. E. 207; May v. Traphagen, 139 N. Y. 478, 481, 34 N. E. 1064; Bruecher v. Village of Port Chester, 101 N. Y. 240, 4 N. E. 272; Bowns v. May, 120 N. Y. 357, 365, 24 N. E. 947. And particularly could the legality of the assessment be tested by the special proceeding provided for by the city charter. Charter, tit. 11. Under such conditions, equity will not interfere to arrest the execution of public work, even though it is claimed to be unwarranted. Dill. Mun. Corp. \u00a7\u00a7 906-922. No <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>other right of action is claimed or set forth in the complaint, and therefore the judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">MERWIN, J., concurs in result.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
