It further appeared that the defendant\u2019s building had been occupied by tenants during all the period from the time of the construction of the plaintiff\u2019s building down to the time when the walls had to be taken down and rebuilt; but there is no evidence to show when the lease was made, whether it was a lease from year to year, or whether the tenants of the defendant\u2019s building were under a lease made prior to the time of the encroachment of the defendant\u2019s wall. It further appeared that in July, 1895, an action was commenced by this plaintiff against the defendant, alleging the encroachment of the defendant\u2019s wall upon the plaintiff\u2019s property; that the building department had required the plaintiff to take down his wall; that the defendant\u2019s wall had</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>encroached upon the plaintiff\u2019s property at the foundation from <em>2% </em>inches in front to 3\u00a3 inches in the rear; that the defendant\u2019s wall was out of plumb, inclining over on the 'plaintiff\u2019s building, and overhanging plaintiff\u2019s land more than 5 inches; that said encroaching wall had pressed plaintiff\u2019s building 5 inches out of plumb at the top, and so cracked and broken the plaintiff\u2019s wall that the building department had notified the plaintiff that it was dangerous, and required him to take down and rebuild the same; that the plaintiff\u2019s damages, in consequence of such encroachment and the rebuilding of the said wall, would amount in all to $10,000; and the complaint asked that a mandatory injunction issue, compelling the defendant to take down and remove said wall, that the plaintiff\u2019s damages be ascertained, and that the plaintiff recover the same against the defendant. The defendant in that action interposed an answer. That case came on for trial, which resulted in a judgment based upon a decision that \u201cthe said defendant, Myers, has wrongfully permitted the said east side wall of his building to gradually encroach upon the plaintiff\u2019s building and lot, so as to endanger the plaintiff\u2019s premises.\u201d The judgment directed the defendant, Myers, to forthwith take down so much of the east side wall of his building, known by the street No. 541 West Twenty-First street, in the city of New York, as overhangs to the eastward the said Myers\u2019 foundation on the easterly side of his said building, and that the defendant, Myers, be forthwith enjoined and restrained from continuing all or any part of the said easterly side of said building known as No. 541 West Twenty-First street, in the city of New York, in .such manner as it overhangs the said foundation on the easterly side of the said building, and towards the building of the plaintiff known as No. 539 West Twenty-First street. This judgment further provided that \u201cthis judgment \u25a0\u00bb \u00ab * gpaii not be a bar to any defense defendant, Myers, may have to any claim for damages against him by reason of the premises.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">There was further evidence as to various surveys of the buildings, One was made on April 14, 1892, from which it appeared that the easterly wall of No. 541 of the defendant\u2019s property encroached upon the plaintiff\u2019s property at the ground from 2 to 4 inches, and that, in addition to such encroachment upon the ground, the wall overhung from 2 to 3^ inches. There was thus an encroachment at the top by an overhanging or bulging of the defendant\u2019s wall of about 3 .inches. There was another survey on April 19, 1895, when,it appeared that the easterly wall of the defendant encroached upon the plaintiff\u2019s building, overhanging 5f inches to the east, pressing up against the plaintiff\u2019s wall; that in the plaintiff\u2019s wall there was a crack running from the ground up to a point several inches above the top of the defendant\u2019s wall. Another survey was made of the premises on November 29, 1895, when it was found that the encroachment of the defendant\u2019s wall had increased so that there was, an overhanging at the roof of from 5-\u00a1- to 6-\u00a1- inches. Subsequently, in January, another survey was made. This was after the plaintiff\u2019s wall had been taken down. It then appeared that the encroachment of the defendant\u2019s wall had increased to 9 inches. This testimony was supported by that of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>the inspector of the building department, who testified that on January 16, 1896, after a portion of the plaintiff\u2019s wall had been taken down, he found that the defendant\u2019s wall had encroached upon the plaintiff\u2019s property by overhanging about 8 inches at the roof, and that subsequently, on November 29, 1896, he found the easterly wall of the defendant\u2019s premises overhanging upon the plaintiff\u2019s premises 9 inches; the overhanging having thus increased 1 inch after the plaintiff\u2019s wall was removed. There was also testimony to show that the plaintiff\u2019s building was well built, with proper foundations, which were capable of sustaining any weight that the building would sustain, and that the building had not been overloaded beyond its ability to bear the load.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">The evidence that the defendant\u2019s wall had encroached upon and pressed against the plaintiff\u2019s wall, and that the injury to the plaintiff\u2019s wall was in consequence of such encroachment and pressure, was clear. The defendant\u2019s wall was shored up to allow the plaintiff\u2019s wall to be taken down, and, after that had been taken down, the defendant\u2019s wall settled against the spur braces used to shore it up, and these braces became tighter after the support furnished by the plaintiff\u2019s wall was removed. The plaintiff\u2019s wall to the north of the defendant\u2019s wall was also shored up with support braces before that portion of the plaintiff\u2019s wall was taken down, but, after the plaintiff\u2019s wall which was against the defendant\u2019s wall had been removed, the plaintiff\u2019s wall to the north resumed to some extent its former position, and the pressure upon the support braces decreased, so that it was necessary to tighten them; thus showing that it was the pressure of the defendant\u2019s wall that forced the plaintiff\u2019s wall out of position.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">At the end of the plaintiff\u2019s case, the court dismissed the complaint upon the ground that, the defendant\u2019s building being in possession of a tenant at the time of the trespass, the defendant was not liable, the court saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-7\">\u201cFrom what I glean from the cases, it appears that the owner can he responsible only under the following conditions: It he creates a nuisance and maintains it; or if he creates a nuisance, and then demises the land, with the nuisance thereon, although he is out of occupation. In other words, if you had proven that at the time of the demise to Hoyt &amp; McKee this nuisance existed, the defendant would be liable. There is no such proof in the case; or if the nuisance of which you complain had been erected by a prior owner or by a stranger, and this defendant had knowingly maintained it. There is no proof to sustain that proposition; in fact, the defendant erected the building himself. If he demised the premises,\u2014that is, if the defendant demised the premises to Hoyt &amp; McKee,\u2014and the defendant covenanted to keep them in repair, and this nuisance was created by reason of the fact that they were not kept in repair, then the defendant would be liable to the plaintiff.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b119-8\">It is from a judgment entered upon the dismissal of this complaint that the plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-9\">The learned judge seems to have treated this action as one to recover damages for a nuisance, and to have based his decision upon the proposition that, as the nuisance was occasioned by an action of the building, while the building was in the continuous possession of tenants, the defendant, as the owner of the building, could not be responsible without a showing that it was the duty of the owner to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>make the repairs. It seems to me that this is an erroneous view of the legal liability that followed from the condition of affairs proved upon the trial. The plaintiff had erected upon his own property a proper building, properly constructed, and was entitled to the uninterrupted enjoyment of it. If the defendant\u2019s building encroached upon the plaintiff\u2019s land so as to injure the plaintiff\u2019s property, the one who maintained the encroaching wall was guilty of a trespass, and was responsible to the plaintiff for any injury sustained thereby. This is not a case where the use to which a building was put caused an injury; nor was it because of any act of the tenant in the use of the defendant\u2019s building that an injury resulted; nor was the injury the result of any failure of the tenant to keep the demised premises in repair, or to perform any duty or obligation, either express or implied, which was imposed upon him in relation to the building demised. What caused the encroachment of the defendant\u2019s building, and whether .the settling of the defendant\u2019s building was caused by a fault in its original construction, the walls not having been connected with floor beams, and whether the defendant\u2019s wall gradually weakened and bulged out, and crowded over against the plaintiff\u2019s wall, for any other cause of original construction, was, at least, a question to be determined by the jury. \u201cTrespass\u201d is defined to be \u201cany unauthorized entry upon the realty of another, to the damage thereof.\u201d Bouv. Law Diet. The plaintiff was in lawful possession of his property, including the land and the building erected thereon. He was entitled to be protected in such possession, and, as was said by the court of appeals in Hay v. Cohoes Co., 2 N. Y. 162: \u201cThe land was his, and, as against the defendant, by an absolute right from the center usque ad caelum. The defendants could not directly infringe that right by any means or for any purpose.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">The fact that at the time of the encroachment the defendant\u2019s property was in possession of a tenant did not relieve the defendant from liability. It did not appear when the lease from the defendant to the tenant was actually made, or whether, at the time the lease under which the tenant was in possession was made, the defendant\u2019s wall was encroaching upon the plaintiff\u2019s property, and injuring the plaintiff\u2019s wall. The only evidence is that for five years prior to the occurrence in question the defendant\u2019s property had been in the occupation of tenants; and it is settled that the owner of premises who rents them to a tenant in a dangerous condition, and who permits them to remain so until, by reason of want of reparation, they fall upon and injure the house of an adjoining owner, is liable to an action (Todd v. Flight, 9 C. B. [N. S.] 377); and as stated by the court of appeals in Swords v. Edgar, 59 N. Y. 34, \u201cThis principle, that the owner of premises who leases them when they are already a nuisance, or must become so from user, and receives rent, is liable for damage to a stranger happening therefrom, whether the owner be in possession or not, is maintained in cases in the courts of this country;\u201d and the case of House v. Metcalf, 27 Conn. 631, is cited-.with approval. It was there held that, \u201cthough the premises were in the exclusive possession and control of a tenant, yet as, at the time of the accident, the cause of it was in the same condition as when the lease was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>made, the premises were used in the manner contemplated and intended by the parties to the lease, and that for such use the defendant was to be paid his stipulated compensation by way of rent, the defendant was liable.\u201d And in Ahern v. Steele, 115 N. Y. 209, 22 N. E. 194, it is stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-5\">\u201cThe owner is responsible. i\u00a3 he creates a nuisance and maintains it; if he creates a nuisance, and then demises the land with the nuisance thereon, although he is out of occupation; if the nuisance was erected on the land by a prior owner, or by a stranger, and he knowingly maintains it; if he has demised premises, and covenanted to keep them in repair, and omits to repair, and thus they become a nuisance; if he demises premises to be used as a nuisance, or for a business or in a way so that they will necessarily become a nuisance. In all such cases, I believe there is now no dispute that the owner would be liable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">There was no evidence here to show that the defendant\u2019s wall had in any way become dangerous or out of repair during the time that the tenant was in possession under a lease from the defendant, or that the trespass was occasioned by any use of the building by the tenant, or in consequence of any neglect on his part in making proper repairs. It was, at least, a question for the jury to say upon this evidence whether or not the settling of the walls of the defendant\u2019s building, or its encroachment upon the plaintiff\u2019s property, was occasioned by the original construction of the defendant\u2019s building, or that at the time it was leased it encroached upon the plaintiff\u2019s property so as to injure the plaintiff\u2019s wall; and, if so, the defendant would be, within the authorities, liable for injury sustained. The plaintiff having shown that the wall of the defendant\u2019s budding did encroach upon his property, and thus caused an injury to the\"walls of his building, the burden was on the defendant to show that such injury was not the result of any cause over which he had control or which he was bound to remedy. The mere fact that during all the period that the trespass existed the building was in the possession of tenants was not sufficient to relieve the defendant from the responsibility for the trespass of the defendant\u2019s wall upon the plaintiff\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">We have discussed the question without reference to the effect of the judgment in the action brought by the plaintiff against the defendant which required the removal of the encroaching wall. It was found as a fact in that case\u2014and the finding of this fact was necessary to justify the judgment\u2014that the east wall of the defendant\u2019s building had been allowed to gradually encroach upon the plaintiff\u2019s premises. To that extent the judgment in that action was conclusive. Whether or not the defendant would be responsible in an action for trespass was a question not necessary to be determined upon that trial, and that question the court in the judgment expressly reserved. The provision in the judgment would not affect the binding force of the adjudication that the defendant\u2019s wall did actually encroach upon the plaintiff\u2019s premises, and so injure the plaintiff\u2019s building that the west wall thereof had to be taken down and rebuilt. The question as to who was responsible for this encroachment of the defendant\u2019s wall, so as to be liable for the damages caused thereby, was a question not necessary for the decision of that case, and was not affected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>by the judgment. But, when it was proved that the encroachment existed, the owner cf the building who had constructed it, and who was in possession of it, through a tenant, receiving rent, would be primarily responsible, and, unless a condition existed which relieved him from such responsibility, it seems that he would be liable for the injuries sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">It follows that the judgment appealed from must he reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
