He was so joined June 18th. The assignor had occupied the entire first loft of the plaintiff\u2019s building (in which the plaintiff had also its place of business) at No. 89 Chambers and No. 71 Reade streets, under a lease for the term of three years from August 1, 1896, at $1,750 per annum, payable in equal monthly payments. On June 16th\u2014the day whereon the assignment was recorded in Boston\u2014the sheriff of New York county, under an attachment procured by the firm of which the defendant Eeimers was a member, levied upon the assignor\u2019s chattels in the New York premises, put keepers in charge, and thereafter remained, according to an admission for the purposes of this case, \u201cin possession,\u201d until Tuesday, August 2d, when he sold the chattels under the execution into which the attachment had ripened. Other attachments were received by the sheriff, beginning with one in favor of the attorneys of the plaintiff herein, which came to him June 18th. Pending the sheriff\u2019s possession, former employ\u00e9s of the assignor, under instructions of the sheriff, and by permission of the attaching creditors, made sales from the stock, the proceeds of which were turned oyer to the sheriff, and held by him under the attachment. By Monday, the 8th of August, the purchasers at the sale had taken away their goods, and the assignees had removed some things not sold,\u2014desks, and the like furniture. The sheriff took the books. This action was brought, as appears by the title, against the defendants individually, and not as assignees. It was brought to recover the rental stipulated in the lease for the months of June, July, and August, 1898.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-9\">To show that assignees for the benefit of creditors are liable for the rental under a contract of hiring by their assignor, it is necessary to show that they have assumed the obligation, either by an express agreement or by unequivocal acts. None of these here appear. There was no oral communication between the parties respecting the lease or premises. When the defendants learned of the existence of the lease, they bade their attorneys write, and their attorneys wrote, to the plaintiffs, that they had not accepted, and would not accept or assume it. A fortnight later, on the day before the sale by the sheriff of the chattels attached, the assignees transferred the lease, if thereto any right or title they had, to one Thorp, at the same time disclaiming that they had any such right, title, or interest, and saying expressly in the paper that the transfer was for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>ihe purpose and intention of transferring such interest, if by any possibility they had it. Great stress is laid upon this paper as an expression of election on the part of the defendants to assume the lease. It is difficult, however, to put upon it any such interpretation. It was, moreover, a transaction between other parties, of which the plaintiff landlord had no information. The sheriff\u2019s custody of the goods upon the premises, herein called \u201cpossession,\u201d was not the possession of the defendants, of whom he was not the agent. If the landlord was unwilling to allow the sheriff to keep the chattels \u25a0 attached where he found them, proceedings should have been brought to dispossess him, for the sheriff did not become a- tenant through the levy or the maintenance of custody, and was not bound to pay the landlord. The assignees had a reasonable time to determine whether an assumption of the lease would be for the benefit of the estate. No case is cited as holding that six days, of which one was Sunday, is an unreasonable time for such election, and the justice\u2019s determination upon the facts that it was reasonable is not to be disturbed.,</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">FREEDMAN, P.
