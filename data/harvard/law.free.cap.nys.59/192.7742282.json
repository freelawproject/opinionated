We find that no abuse of that discretion which is lodged in the court at special term was made in this case. The decision to vacate an inquest is entirely a discretionary one, and, without a clear abuse, will not he disturbed by the general term. 2 Rum. Prac. p. 228; Leighton v. Wood, 17 Abb. Prac. 177. Upon the trial no legal or reasonable excuse for postponement was advanced, and the justice there presiding properly declined to adjourn the trial because of an \u201cexpected agreement,\u201d unsupported by affidavit of any kind. We may also allude to the absence of the affidavit of merits required by the rule as an additional ground for our decision hereon. Johnson v. Lynch, 15 How.
