It was settled by payment, and the following receipt was finally given:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-17\">\u201cNew York, September 9, 1898.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-18\">\u201cReceived of Mary Vermilyea ?4 in full settlement suit in city court, George H. Elliott vs. Mary Vermilyea. Johnes &amp; Travis,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-19\">\u201cAttorneys for Plaintiff.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b209-20\">On September 19, 1898, plaintiff\u2019s attorneys gave notice of motion \u201cfor an order discontinuing this action without costs.\u201d In this notice of motion they do not ask for costs of motion; consequently none could be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-21\">It follows that the order of September 27, 1898, granting $10 motion costs, is erroneous, and should be modified by striking out the $10 costs, and discontinuing the action without costs, as prayed for in the notice of motion. The order of October 3, 1898, denying resettlement, is reversed, inasmuch as the order should have been resettled as indicated. No costs of this appeal to either party.
