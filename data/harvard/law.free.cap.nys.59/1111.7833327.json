As to the amount of damages, if found to be excessive, we might, as a matter of law, consider the determination of the jury; but, as the case stands, the verdict should not be disturbed, as there is sufficient evidence to sustain it against all points raised by the appellant in her well-considered brief. Judgment appealed from affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
