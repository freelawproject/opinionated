Upon these facts the learned justice rightly found that the defendant had converted the check, rejecting his claim that he was entitled to its possession as property lost by or stolen from him, and of which the finder or the thief could give no title, for, it being the policy of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>law merchant that negotiable paper of any kind shall have unrestricted circulation, and that persons acquiring it in good faith may do so in safety without the liability of having their rights questioned, an exception in favor of all negotiable instruments was in-grafted early on the rule that no one can acquire a title to a chattel personal from a man who has himself no title to it (\u2018Tierno dot quad non habet\u201d). The plaintiff was therefore entitled to have it stated in the judgment that the defendant was subject to arrest and imprisonment (Consol. Act, \u00a7 1386), and the judgment must be reversed.
