As we have seen in the appeal of McCrea, in this same entitled action, the arrest upon execution of a judgment debtor is no longer a satisfaction of that judgment, except while the imprisonment continues. In addition to that, under the facts in this case, no intent to satisfy the judgment, or to release the defendant McCrea from imprisonment, can be inferred from the acts of the plaintiff, and that there was no satisfaction or discharge of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-14\">It follows from this that the motion of the defendant was properly denied, and that the order appealed from should be affirmed. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
