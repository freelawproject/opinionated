The assignor testified that he had the privilege of leaving the paper in the cellar of the defendants\u2019 premises, which he \u00a1conceded to be the place of delivery. He also testified that he removed all the bundles, with the exception of 12, which he left in the cellar. No charge was made for their storage. He admits that they were subject .to removal by him at his pleasure. In May, 1895, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>defendants moved their place of business, and, according to the testimony of two of their witnesses, notified the plaintiff\u2019s assignor to remove the 12 bundles. The latter, while professing no recollection of the notice, does not deny that he received it. Upon quitting the old premises, the defendants left the paper in controversy in the cellar. Shortly thereafter, the plaintiff\u2019s assignor, having paid no attention to the notice, made demand for his goods. This was ignored. Three and a half years later this suit was begun for the value of the 12 bundles. Judgment was had by the defendants, and the plaintiff has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">This disposition of the cause was proper. The defendants were, at most, gratuitous bailees, and there is proof to show that they discharged their full obligation of exercising the slight care incumbent on them. The depositories (that is, the defendants) terminated the deposit by giving due notice to the depositor (that is, the plaintiff\u2019s assignor), who, failing to remove his property in compliance therewith, must bear the loss subsequently occurring. Dale v. Brinckerhoff, 7 Daly, <em>45; </em>Roulston v. McClelland, 2 E. D. Smith, 60.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">A motion was made below on affidavits for a new trial on the ground of newly-discovered evidence. This motion was properly denied, as the justice was without jurisdiction to entertain the application. The extent of his power to grant a new trial, as defined by chapter 748 of the Laws of 1896, is measured by the provisions of section 999 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which does not embrace new trials grounded on newly-discovered evidence. See Martin v. Guindon, 22 Misc. Rep. 139, 48 N. Y. Supp. 694. Even if the court could have taken cognizance of the motion, no appeal would lie from its denial of the relief. Robb v. Osgoodby, 20 Misc. Rep. 622, 46 N. Y. Supp. 451. The judgment must be affirmed, and the appeal from the order dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">Judgment affirmed, with costs to the respondents, and appeal from order dismissed. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
