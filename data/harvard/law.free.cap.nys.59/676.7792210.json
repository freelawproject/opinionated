Act), and the contention is shown to be good by the return, from which it appears that the action was brought to trial on October 11th; that the parties at the close of the trial extended the time of the submission to November, 5, 1898, as they had a right to do (Keating v. Serrell, 5 Daly, 278); and that judgment, instead of being rendered on the 13th, was not rendered until November 17, 1898, and was therefore invalid, because jurisdiction had terminated (Dalton v. Loughlin, 4 Abb. N. C. 187). The judgment should therefore be reversed, for \u201cwhere an inferior court has acted without having jurisdiction, and has rendered judgment, the appellate court which has power to review its decisions may so far act upon the judgment as to reverse it for that want of jurisdiction.\u201d McMahon v. Rauhr, 47 N. Y. 67.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-8\">Judgment reversed, with costs to the appellant. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
