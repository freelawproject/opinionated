After such money had been paid over, the order therefor was reversed on appeal. Plaintiff, in the second paragraph of the complaint, alleged as follows: \u201c(2) That said moneys were at said time and at the time of the payment thereof by said Grant to said Gray the property of said Charles H. Ashley [plaintiff\u2019s assignor], and were and constituted the December, 1897, salary of said Ashley, which he earned as an officer or patrolman in the police department of the city of New York, said Grant being at said time the captain of police in said department, under whom the said Ashley was serving as such police officer, and which salary and money was collected by said Grant, to be paid by him to the said Ashley.\u201d The second paragraph of defendant\u2019s answer is as follows: \u201c(2) He denies that he has any knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief as to the truth of the allegation contained in the second paragraph of the complaint, that the said moneys were at the time of the payment thereof by said Grant to said Cochrane for said Gray the property of said Charles H. Ashley, except subject to defendant\u2019s judgment lien, as hereinafter alleged; and this defendant alleges upon information and belief that at the time said moneys were paid by said Grant to said Cochrane, and prior to said alleged assignment to plaintiff by said Ashley, and for a long time prior thereto, and from the 31st day of December, 1897, the said moneys were, and still are, subject to an order of this court duly made in supplementary proceedings in an action wherein said John A. Gray was plaintiff and judgment creditor and said Charles H. Ashley was defendant and judgment debtor, brought against said Grant, as a third party, and said Ashley, and that said moneys, as defendant is informed and believes, were from the 31st day of December, 1897, and still are, subject to the lien of said supplementary proceedings and the judgment upon which said proceedings are founded.\u201d The defendant, by way of counterclaim, alleged that \u201con or about the 4th day of November, 1897, in an action duly brought in the then district court in the city of New York for the Third judicial district, wherein John Gray (this defendant) was plaintiff and the said Charles H. Ashley, referred to in the complaint as plaintiff\u2019s assignor, was defendant, a judgment was duly rendered in favor of said John A. Gray and against said Charles H. Ashley for the sum of 872.00, and that said judgment is still due and unpaid, and that at and prior to the time of the alleged assignment from said Ashley to plaintiff herein, and at the time of the commencement of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>action, the said Charles H. Ashley was justly indebted to this defendant the amount of said judgment; and in connection herewith defendant further alleges upon information and belief that at the times referred to in the second paragraph or subdivision of the complaint the said Grant referred to in said paragraph was not the captain of police in said department under whom the said Ashley was serving as such police officer, as alleged in the complaint.\u201d</summary>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b808-4\">Argued before McCARTHY, P.

We are convinced by all the authorities examined that this pleads a denial, and therefore the answer is good in that particular. We think that the demurrer to the counterclaim should be sustained. See Ketcham v. Zerega, 1 E. D. Smith, 553. Judgment is therefore reversed, without costs to either party as against the other, and the demurrer to the second paragraph of the answer overruled, and to the counterclaim sustained, without costs to either party. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
