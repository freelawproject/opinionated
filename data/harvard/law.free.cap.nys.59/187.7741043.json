This was intended for one who had failed to-demand the return of the chattel in his answer. There can be no reason for a demand for the return of the chattel in the answer, which is part of the pleading, and again in a separate notice. All the court requires to know is that a return of the chattel is demanded. Besides, the plaintiff is clearly guilty of loches, in that it appears that judgment by default was rendered on June 9,- 1894, and the motion to-vacate and set aside the judgment taken by default was not made until June 4, 1896. I fully concur with VAN WYCK, C. J.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-16\">Order affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-17\">SOHUCHMAN, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
