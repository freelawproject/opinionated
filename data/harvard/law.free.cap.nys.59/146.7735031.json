Section 395, Code Civ. Proc., says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-12\">\u201cAn acknowledgment or promise contained in a writing signed by the party to be charged thereby is the only competent evidence of a new or continuing contract whereby to take a case out of the operation of this title.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b175-13\">If an acknowledgment \u201cof a continuing contract\u201d is made out by defendant\u2019s letter of February 13, 1892, that will suffice, whether a promise to pay is made therein or not. The plaintiff, a few days before that date, wrote to the respondent that he would like pay for the note. The respondent might have answered that he did not acknowledge any liability on it, but, instead, he wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-14\">\u201cI am going to try to have the note settled in some way in a short time. * * * I am very anxious to have it settled, as it is growing more every year.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b175-15\">It certainly was not growing more every year unless it was \"a continuing contract.\u201d He promised to see the other makers, \u201call of them,\u201d and see \u201cwhat can be done.\u201d Why trouble himself about it in this way, if it was not \u201ca continuing contract\u201d? Finally lie wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-16\">\u201cIf I have to pay it myself, will you accept of it in installments, as I cannot very well spare so much out of my business intone payment?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b175-17\">Clearly, he meant that, if the Whitakers should fail to pay it, it would be hard for him to do it, but do it he would. To say that this letter, written in response to the plaintiff\u2019s request for payment, does not amount to an acknowledgment of \u201ca continuing contract,\u201d seems to me to be replacing its true meaning with a false one. I advise affirmance.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-18\">Order affirmed, with costs. All concur, except PARKER, P. J., and PUTNAM, J., who dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
