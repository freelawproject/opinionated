The defendant alleged that the contract had been rescinded upon the plaintiff\u2019s voluntary resignation and abandonment on the 14th of March. The defendant also alleged a tender to the plaintiff on the 19th of April (which was after the commencement of this action) of the amount due him as wages up to and including the 14th day of March, together with interest and the costs and disbursements of the action; further adding that he \u201cnow brings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>the said sum, <em>* </em>* * together with interest thereon, and the costs and disbursements of this action to date, into this court, ready to be paid to the plaintiff if he will accept the same.\u201d As the learned justice rendered judgment for the defendant, it may be assumed that he considered the evidence sufficient to prove rescission of the contract. Even if he so found, he should have rendered judgment for the plaintiff to the amount of the indebtedness admitted by the allegation of the tender; for, as the tender was neither accepted nor duly paid into court, it could not avail the defendant. Section 732, Code Civ. Proc. The judgment should be reversed, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">Judgment reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
