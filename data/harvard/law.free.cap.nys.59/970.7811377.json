An appeal from an order relating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"971\">*971</page-number>to the form of the pleading falls when the pleading itself is adjudged bad upon demurrer. If the plaintiff had desired to review the action of the court below in striking out this allegation, he should have brought his appeal on for argument before the trial of the issue of law on the demurrer. As counsel for both parties concede upon the argument that such demurrer has been interposed and sustained, the appeal should be dismissed, but, as no formal motion to dismiss the appeal was made, without costs. Appeal dismissed, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
