J.</author>\n<p id=\"AF7\">This action was brought to recover for injuries to personal property \u00b0 sustained by the plaintiff through the alleged negligence of the defendant in permitting one of its cars to collide with the plaintiff\u2019s wagon while crossing the defendant\u2019s tracks on Sixth avenue. The testimony in the case shows that the plaintiff left his stables in Fifty-Sixth street, between Sixth and Seventh avenues, and drove to the intersection of that street with Sixth avenue on his way downtown. Two carriages were standing at the corner, which prevented the plaintiff from driving between the westerly track and the curb, and the plaintiff therefore drove upon the car track, and continued thereon until near the middle of the block, when he turned from the track towards the west, and when the front wheels of his wagon were off the track the hind wheels were struck by a downtown car, and the injuries complained of resulted from such collision. The above statement contains all the testimony on the part of the plaintiff as to the occurrence. It does not appear, although it may be said, that the plaintiff was compelled to go upon the defendant\u2019s tracks at the point where he first went upon Sixth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>avenue, or that he was compelled to remain in that situation, and it does appear that he voluntarily continued to occupy the dangerous position he had assumed until he was near the middle of the block. At no time did he endeavor in any way to ascertain whether there was a car approaching, nor does it appear from any testimony produced by him how far distant the car was, either at the time he went upon the track or at the time he attempted to leave it. He relied entirely upon the vigilance of the motorman of the car to avoid being struck. This does not show freedom from contributory negligence on his part. Johnson v. Railroad Co., 34 App. Div. 271, 54 N. Y.
