By the assignment, executed on the 8th day of July, 1898, the defendant professed to transfer to the plaintiff all right, title, and interest \u201cin and to any claim which I may have against the city of New York for services either between the 1st day of July, 1898, and the 31st day of July, 1898, or any other time or period, which claim amounts to one hundred dollars ($100.00), without deduction\u201d; and he also warranted that the said claim \u201cis a legal claim against the city of New York for that amount, and also that I am now the lawful owner thereof, and have full power to assign the same.\u201d The testimony fails to show representations of any kind made by the defendant to the plaintiff, excepting the assertion in the paper of assignment that the said claim is \u201ca legal, claim against the city of New York,\u201d which paper, upon its face, must be taken to be an assignment, by way of anticipation, of the salary to become due to a public officer, and so void. Bliss v. Lawrence, 58 N. Y. 442. With the knowledge of that fact in law, the plaintiff was as chargeable as was the defendant, and he may not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>now say he was misled. Furthermore, there is no evidence of any damage in the case, other than the recitals in this void assignment of the nominal consideration of \u201cone .dollar to me in hand paid.\u201d It does not appear that the plaintiff parted with a cent in reliance upon any representations by the defendant. The only testimony about payment of money in the case is that of plaintiff\u2019s one witness, who testifies that he did not at that time give Mr. Crane the amount stated in the assignment, but that he gave him $90 in February for March, and that was prior to any representations appearing herein. The judgment should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">Judgment reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">FREEDMAN, P.
