This was his right. Laws 1897, c. 378, \u00a7 1543. And the cause, as we held in People ex rel. Mitchell v. Lagrange, 2 App. Div. 444, 37 N. Y. Supp. 991, affirmed in 151 N. Y. 664, 46 N. E. 1150, must be substantial-pointing to some dereliction or neglect of duty, or affecting his character or fitness for the position. In the present case the charges, upon their face, were certainly substantial. They involved dereliction and neglect of duty. To make this clear, we need only quote the first and second of these charges. They read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-14\">\u201c(1) Omission to properly perform your duty as clerk in the department of buildings, and neglect and disobedience of order of the commissioner of buildings, in making a false \u00e1hd misleading report to the commissioner of buildings. . When called upon to state in writing the duties performed by you under the former administration, you failed to report as part of your duties the examination and dismissal of violations and other cases; and for such purpose your right to use the name of the superintendent of buildings. (2) Dismissing violations and other cases without the consent and authority of the commissioner of buildings.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-16\">The question then is, was the relator\u2019s explanation sufficient? Here, again, under the Mitchell Case, supra, he was entitled to fair consideration. If his explanation was such as should have satisfied a fair-minded man, if it admitted of no reasonable inference of dereliction or neglect, it could not be denied its due effect. In other words, if the explanation was clearly satisfactory, the respondent should have been satisfied with it.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-17\">We have gone over the record carefully in the light of these rules, and we find it impossible to say that the relator\u2019s explanation ad-, mitted of no reasonable inference of dereliction or neglect. We refer to the first charge, and the explanation given with respect</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>thereto. In considering this charge and the relator\u2019s explanation, we must look at the surroundings. The respondent became commissioner of buildings on the 1st day of January, 1898. One of his first acts was to require the employ\u00e9s in his department to furnish him with certain data. They were to give their names, residences, positions, dates of appointment, and salaries. Each employ\u00e9 was to state whether he had passed a civil service examination, and whether he was a veteran. He was also required to define his duties, and to state whether there had been any change in these duties since his appointment. This was a judicious step on the new commissioner\u2019s part. He had just come into a most responsible office. It was of the utmost importance that he should have precise information as to its practical workings, and especially as to the duties performed by its numerous employ\u00e9s. Upon the efficiency of these employ\u00e9s in the performance of their special duties the success of the respondent\u2019s administration largely depended. The least that the commissioner, under these circumstances, had a right to expect from each of the employ\u00e9s,' was a full and clear statement of his duties, free from reserve, and adequate to enlighten the head of the office as to the powers with which the employ\u00e9 was being intrusted. The relator\u2019s case was especially in this category. Originally his work was purely clerical, but he had been advanced until, when the respondent came in, Ms duties had become most important. Mr. Constable, the respondent\u2019s predecessor, had given the relator authority either finally to dismiss what are called \u201ccases,\u201d or to cancel them and have new cases made. These so-called cases consisted of the material upon which the department acted in enforcing the provisions of the building law, and in checking violations thereof. The relator had discretionary power to hold these cases back, or to forward them to the attorney for the department. As Mr. Veiller Mmself testified, \u201cIt depended entirely upon me whether cases should go to court or not.\u201d These certainly were great powers,\u2014powers of the vesting of which in any one clerk it was eminently proper that the new commissioner should be advised. The fact is undisputed that Mr. Veiller never directly informed the respondent that he possessed these powers, or that his duties called for their exercise. In his answer to the respondent\u2019s request for a definition of Ms duties, the relator stated that he had \u201cgeneral charge of all cases in attorney\u2019s office prior to actual suit,\u201d and that he was \u201cspecial assistant to superintendent of buildings, seeing the public,\u201d and that he was \u201cin charge of superintendent\u2019s private office.\u201d The statement that he had general charge of all cases in the attorney\u2019s office prior to actual suit could not well have suggested the absolute power finally to dismiss such cases, or to cancel them and commence anew, and to bring them into court, or not, as he saw fit. This power was the crucial fact which should have been promptly disclosed. It is suggested that the power was inferable from what was stated. A more accurate view of the relator\u2019s statement is that the power might possibly have been divined therefrom. It cannot fairly be said that the respondent was reasonably required to draw the suggested inference. Certainly it is not the inference <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>which Mr. Veiller himself drew from the statement, nor is it the construction which he placed upon it; for, when he was asked this question by the respondent: \u201cQ. Did you inform me that you possessed such power?\u201d\u2014he replied: \u201cNo, sir; but in a later communication, of January 5th, I did. On January 5th I wrote you, stating those facts, but received no reply.\u201d It is thus apparent that Mr. Veiller realized the insufficiency of his original reply to the respondent\u2019s request, and it remains to be considered whether he supplied the required information in this subsequent letter. The letter reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-5\">\u201cJanuary 5th, 1898.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-6\">\u201cHon. Thomas J. Brady, Commissioner of Buildings\u2014Dear Sir: I would respectfully request instructions from you as to whether you wish me to continue to do the same kind of work for you that I was in the habit of doing for Mr. Constable. All of this work involved the use of Mr. Constable\u2019s signature, permission to use which was granted to me by him. The routine work of the department will necessarily accumulate, unless the work that I have been in the custom of doing is done; and, as I do not wish such work to accumulate without your knowledge, I respectfully refer the matter to you, and ask further instructions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-7\">\u201cYours, respectfully, Lawrence Veiller.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">There is a question of fact as to whether the commissioner received this letter. It was not proved that the letter was ever delivered to him. The relator testified that he handed the letter to Miss Rose O\u2019Brien, who was then acting as the respondent\u2019s secretary, and that it was placed upon the respondent\u2019s desk. The respondent stated upon the hearing that he had received no such communication. It seems peculiar, under these circumstances, that the relator neither called Miss O\u2019Brien as a witness, nor\u2014were this inadmissible\u2014asked permission to have her interrogated on the subject. Assuming, however, that the letter should have been considered as-a part of the relator\u2019s explanation, and as indicative of his honest intention to convey the information required, it seems to us that the letter is even less satisfactory than Mr. Veiller\u2019s original statement. In fact, it apparently justified the characterization of the information actually given as \u201cmisleading.\u201d The relator in this letter still entirely fails to disclose the powers to which we have referred. How was the respondent to divine from anything contained therein that the kind of work which Mr. Veiller was \u201cin the habit of doing for Mr. Constable\u201d involved absolute discretion as to the dismissal of cases? What the respondent asked was a definition of the duties which the relator was in the habit of performing. The letter was silent as to these duties. And what was there in the reference to the probable accumulation of routine work to call any one\u2019s attention to the power in question? There was surely nothing of a routine character in the dismissal of cases upon the exercise of judgment, in the holding back or forwarding of cases to the attorney, or' in the recalling of papers from the attorney\u2019s office. To speak of such duties as \u201croutine work\u201d was clearly \u201cmisleading,\u201d and it may well be that it was that expression which prevented further inquiry on the respondent\u2019s part. It may also account for the fact that Mr. Veiller received no reply to this communication. For, if it 'was-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>but mere routine work which the relator was in the habit of doing, the respondent would naturally dismiss the subject. It is true that in this letter the relator informs the respondent that he had permission to use Mr. Constable\u2019s signature. So far he was explicit. But he nowhere suggested, directly or indirectly, the nature of the particular duty which called for the use of the commissioner\u2019s signature. The statement on that head simply conveyed the idea that the commissioner\u2019s signature was being used by the relator when he was doing the undisclosed work that he was in the habit of doing, or when he was doing the routine work of the department. The point is that the new commissioner was still left entirely in the dark as to the important powers which the relator was exercising,\u2014 powers which the relator admits he had not previously disclosed, and which, as he realized when he wrote the letter, he was called upon to disclose. It seems strange that when the relator sat down, as he says he did, to write a letter \u201cstating these facts\u201d as to his powers and duties, the obscure and meager communication under consideration should have been the sole product. It is said that many of these \u201cviolations\u201d were trivial and technical, or unsupported by evidence. But it was for the relator to say whether they were such. Whether the violations were great or small, serious or trivial, were questions for his determination. It is apparent, therefore, that the respondents\u2019 request for information was never complied with. It is true, as argued, that he could doubtless have informed himself on the subject by making an independent inquiry. But the same criticism would apply to his attitude with regard to the entire body of clerks. They, too, might, in response to the respondent\u2019s request, have given him inaccurate or but partial information. But would it be any answer to an accusation on that head that the commissioner should have spent his time in searching the books of the department, or in going about and making specific inquiries either of the clerks themselves or of others? It seems reasonable that a busy man, upon whose time the public had just claims, should try to economize that time as he did here, and get at the bottom of the system which he was called upon to administer, by requiring a direct report in writing from each employ\u00e9. The failure loyally to respond to such a request, or to furnish full and accurate information as required, was, in our judgment, a substantial cause for removal. That cause existed here, and it was not clearly and satisfactorily explained. To say the least, the explanation admitted of a reasonable inference of dereliction and neglect.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">The second charge was a natural sequence to the first. The relator discontinued the use of the respondent\u2019s name after the 5th of January, and he says that he did not thereafter forward cases for prosecution. With these exceptions, however,- he continued to exercise his general powers, without, as we have seen, informing the respondent of their nature. He was asked this question: \u201cQ. And you went on doing the same things you had done before, excepting that you felt that the use of his signature, after you received no reply to that letter, was a delicate matter, which you preferred not to employ?\u201d\u2014to Avhich he gave the following- ansAver: \u201cA. Yes; I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>went on doing the same things. Many of my duties, however, were performed by Mr. Johnson.\u201d The third charge related to the use of the commissioner\u2019s name. This, however, continued only until the 5th of January; and the explanation on that head is mainly significant as indicating that the relator realized that he should have the respondent\u2019s affirmative consent and authority\u2014founded, of course, upon proper information\u2014before attempting to exercise under the new administration one of the important powers vested in him by the preceding.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">The remaining charges need not be specially considered. They relate to matters which occurred under the preceding administration, and some of them\u2014the fourth and fifth\u2014affect the relator in his relation to the present administration mainly because he kept his knowledge of these matters to himself, and failed to report what he knew. As to the sixth, the respondent seems to have thought that the previous system of canceling cases was injudicious. With that administrative question we have, of course, nothing to do. The very fact, however, that the respondent\u2019s judgment on that head differed from that of his predecessor, and that, when apprised of what had thus been done in a particular instance, he emphatically repudiated the method adopted, shows how important it was that the information originally asked of the employ\u00e9s should have been fully afforded him, and that nothing should have been withheld as to that combination of duties and methods which went to the root of the entire administrative system of the office.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">Our conclusion in dismissing the writ, however, rests upon the charges which have been already discussed. As to these, we see no escape from the conclusion that the commissioner acted fairly and reasonably, and that his dissatisfaction with the relator\u2019s explanation was in good faith, and involved a proper exercise of judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">The writ should therefore be dismissed, and the action of the respondent confirmed, with |50 costs and disbursements of the appeal. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
