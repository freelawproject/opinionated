Froc. \u00a7 3297, allows a referee for selling real property pursuant to a judgment the same fees as those allowed the sheriff. Code Civ. Froc. \u00a7 3307, subds. 7, 11, fix the fees allowed a sheriff for sales of real estate, '\u25a0 and include the sheriff of New York county. A special act (Laws 1890; c. 523) made the sheriff of New .York county a salaried officer, and required him to turn the fees over to the county treasurer, -and provided that the sheriff should be entitled to a return of half the fees so collected and turned over. The special act increased the fees over those allowed by the general act. <em>Held, </em>that referee\u2019s fees in partition should be computed on the basis provided by section 3307, subds. 7, 11; the special act not being an amendment of the general law, and the statute not providing that referee\u2019s fees should be the same as those allowed the county.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b394-14\">Appeal from special term, New York county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b394-15\">Action by Mary A.

Both sides agree that the fees are regulated by section 3297 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The material language of that section is this: \u201cThe fees of a referee appointed to sell real property, pursuant to a judgment in an action, are the same as those allowed to the sheriff.\u201d What was immediately contemplated by this is clear enough. The fees to which a sheriff was then entitled upon the sale of real property were distinctly specified in a later section of the same Code (section 3307, subds. 7, 11). Under this latter section, sheriff\u2019s fees varied somewhat in different localities. They were, however, the same in all the counties of the state, except New York, Kings, and Westchester. In these three latter counties a different rate was provided. It seems quite clear, so far, that the referee\u2019s fees correspondingly varied, and that section 3297 allowed to a referee appointed in any particular county the same fees as were then allowed to the sheriff of that county. The present question arises because of a special act passed in 1890 \u201cin relation to the office of the sheriff of the city and county of New York.\u201d Laws 1890, c. 523. Under that act the sheriff of the county of New York was made a salaried officer, and a radical change was made in the administration of the office. The fees collectible by the sheriff of the county of New York were revised and increased,\u2014in many respects doubled. The sheriff was required to account for these fees, and pay them over into the treasury of the county; and the act provided that he. \"shall be entitled to one-half of such fees,\u201d to be paid to him upon the approval by the comptroller of his monthly accounts. Under this special act the sheriff was authorized to collect as fees upon the sale of real property under an execution a larger percentage than he was theretofore allowed under section 3307 of the Code. The referee in the present case claims that he is entitled to this increased percentage. The court below held otherwise, and limited him to the sheriff\u2019s percentage specified in section 3307. We think it dear that, if the increased percentage had been given to the sheriff by a simple amendment of this latter section, the referee\u2019s fees would have kept pace therewith. The intention of the legislature would not in that case have been questionable. The difficulty is, however, that the special act involves a complete change of system. Under the general act the sheriff was \u201centitled\u201d to the fees for his services. Under the special act he is allowed a salary, and the city and county of New York is entitled to the fees for his services as its official. He is directed by the act (section 17) to collect these fees and pay them over to the comptroller. As between the county and himself, he is \u201centitled\u201d to a return of one-half of them. Such an act was not. in any sense an amendment of the general act. What it did was to withdraw the particular locality from the area of the general act. No fees are \u201callowed to the sheriff\u201d by this special act, within the intent and meaning of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>that phrase as used in section 3297. It is impossible to adapt the latter section to the special act, as it would have been impossible harmoniously to ingraft the special act upon section 3307. Practically what is now allowed to the sheriff in this county is a salary and a claim upon the county for one-half of the fees allowed to it. The legislative intent as expressed in section 3297 could not have comprehended such changed conditions as these. It related to the general system of sheriff\u2019s fees then in vogue, as minutely \u25a0 provided; for in section 3307. And'it undoubtedly embraced later variations in the quantum of those fees made by amendment to section 3307, or by an equivalent special act. But it certainly did not contem-' plate the adaptation of the referee\u2019s fees, allowed by section 3297, to a salaried system, in which the fees become primarily the property of the county, and are returned to the sheriff, in part, as an incident to his salary.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">We have said that the special act in question took the sheriff o\u00ed the county of New York out of the area of the general act. The effect of this, however, was not to deprive referees appointed to sell real property in this county of any fees. Section 3307 may still be resorted to for the purpose of ascertaining the proper allowance to a referee under section 3297. The former section no longer governs as between litigants and the sheriff, but the referee\u2019s compensation may be computed thereon quite as though the percentage specified therein had been literally embodied in section 3297. It is those percentages which section 3297 gave to the referees, and those percentages stand until they are taken away, either by some act directly relating to referee\u2019s fees, or by some act relating to- sheriff\u2019s fees which can reasonably be brought within the original legislative purpose, as that purpose was expressed when the legislature said that the fees of a referee should be the same as those allowed to the sheriff. The legislature has never said that the fees of a referee should be the same as those allowed to the county.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">The order appealed from should be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">VAN BRUNT, P. J., and INGRAHAM and McLAUGHLIN, JJ., concur. RUMSEY, J., concurs, except that he is of opinion that the referee\u2019s fees provided for in section 3297 could only be varied by a direct amendment to section 3307 with regard to sheriff\u2019s fees, and would not be affected by \u201can equivalent special act.\u201d</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
