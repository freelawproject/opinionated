J.</author>\n<p id=\"A_IZ\">This action was brought to recover damages for an assault alleged to have been committed upon the plaintiff by one of the defendant\u2019s employ\u00e9s while she was proceeding to take passage upon one of the defendant\u2019s ferryboats at the foot of Thirty-Ninth street, on September 6, 1895. An examination of the record in this case does not disclose, nor does the appellant claim, that any error was committed in the reception or exclusion of. evidence. The brief of the appellant is largely devoted to a discussion of the weight that should be given to the testimony, but upon an appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>from the general term of the city court to the appellate term the weight of evidence is not open to review. Carney v. Reilly, 18 Misc. Rep. 11, 40 N. Y. Supp. 1123. In the case at bar the plaintiff testified to facts which, if believed by the jury, entitled her to a verdict. It is true, she was the only witness in her own behalf as to the actual facts regarding the assault. The witnesses for the defendant, however, were all employ\u00e9s of the company. There was' sufficient testimony to require the submission of the case to the jury upon the disputed questions of fact, and there appears to have been no error committed upon the trial to warrant the interference of this court. The judgment must therefore be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">LEVENTBITT, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b583-7\">MacLEAN, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aan\">I concur in the result, but, under Claflin v.
