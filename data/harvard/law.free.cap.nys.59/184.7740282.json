The defense was a breach of warranty. The question of warranty was properly submitted to the jury, who returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff. The verdict is not against the weight of evidence, and is supported by the evidence. The exception to the rejection of a paper writing in evidence is without any merit, because the witness did not testify that he knew that the paper writing in ink and the lead-pencil memorandum made thereon were correctly made, and correctly stated the truth of the facts represented by the writing. These are the only questions that are raised by the appellant, on this appeal, in his. brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-15\">Judgment and order appealed from affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-16\">HASCALL, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
