Power is there given to the appellate division of the supreme court to remove the defendant in this proceeding \u201cfor cause after due notice and an opportunity of being heard.\u201d We think this provision of law requires that the proceedings against the person charged should be instituted upon specific charges, sufficient in their nature to warrant the removal, and then, unless admitted, be proven <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>to be true, with an opportunity to the person charged to cross-examine the witnesses produced to support the charges, call others in his defense, and to be represented by counsel. People v. Nichols, 79 N. Y. 588. The charges upon which this application is made, consisting of the affidavits of the commissioners of accounts, would seem to be specific charges, which require an answer from the person charged, and his affidavit in reply a sufficient answer to such charges. But it would appear that there must be a regular proceeding before the court, when an opportunity will be given to the representatives of the' city to prove the charges, and an opportunity to the defendant to be heard in opposition; and the time of this hearing is hereby fixed for October 2, 1899, at 10:30 a. m.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
