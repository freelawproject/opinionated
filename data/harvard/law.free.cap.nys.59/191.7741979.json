The defendant claims to have performed services and made disbursements for the decedent aggregating $1,616.36, and admits his liability for the balance. It appears that defendant, as attorney of decedent, counterclaims for his services in said partition the following items: 35 per cent, of $2,028.28, \u2022$709.90; attorney\u2019s fees paid to Philo P. Safford, $350,\u2014a total of $1,059.90; while an extra allowance of $500 was already received by him. When such claims are made, it would be an injustice to deprive the adversary of a trial by jury. Defendant\u2019s professional services, which are principally disputed herein, were rendered in one action; and, although the bill of items particularizes them, that fact does not bring the action into that class which becomes referable, as involving a \u201clong account,\u201d within the meaning of the term as it is used in the Code, and as it has been construed by the courts. Feeter v. Arkenburgh, 147 N. Y. 237, 41 N. E. 518; Eandall v. Sherman, 131 N. Y. 669, 30 N. E. 589; Spence v. Simis, 137 N. Y. 616, 33 N. E. 554; Hedges v. Methodist Protestant Church, 23 App. Div. 347, 48- N. Y. Supp. 154.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-14\">Order appealed from is .reversed with costs and disbursements, and motion denied, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
