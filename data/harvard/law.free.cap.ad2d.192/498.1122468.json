Although a speedy trial is the preferred method by which to remedy any perceived inequities in a pendente lite award <em>(see, Gianni v Gianni, </em>172 AD2d 487; <em>Barasch v Barasch, </em>166 AD2d 399), relief may be granted on appeal where justice so dictates <em>(see, Rosenthal v Rosenthal, </em>173 AD2d 453; <em>Wesler v Wesler, </em>133 AD2d 627). Taking into consideration the standard of living previously enjoyed by the parties, the parties\u2019 respective financial conditions, and the wife\u2019s reasonable needs, we find that the temporary maintenance awarded by the Supreme Court was excessive. An award of up to $5,000 per month in temporary maintenance, together with the additional pendente lite relief awarded by the court, would represent a more appropriate accommodation between the parties\u2019 needs under the circumstances of this case, and would be sufficient to ensure that the wife maintains her prior life style <em>(see, Barasch v Barasch, supra; Zahr v Zahr, </em>149 AD2d 504; <em>Bernstein v Bernstein, </em>143 AD2d 168; <em>Match v Match, </em>134 AD2d 210).
