Washington (Washington) is a black female and a former employee of Pico\u2019s restaurant in Waco, Texas. Tortillas Et Cetera, Inc. (Tortillas) is the corporation that owns and operates Pico\u2019s. Herbert Paths is one of two co-owners of Tortillas Et Cetera, and Dennis Paths is a manager at Pico\u2019s. Washington claims that she was discharged from Pico\u2019s because of her race, and she brought a Title VII action against Tortillas, Herbert Paths, and Dennis Paths. The district court granted Herbert Patlis\u2019s motion for summary judgment. After a bench trial, the court found that neither Tortillas nor Dennis Paths discriminated against Washington because of her race. On appeal, Washington assigns four errors: (1) the findings failed to address direct evidence of discrimination; (2) one finding was defective; (3) the court erred in ruling on her motion for a new trial; and (4) costs should not have taxed to an <em>in forma pau-peris </em>Title VII plaintiff. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1129-8\">I. Background.</p>\n<p id=\"b1129-9\">Washington worked at Pico\u2019s in various capacities for almost ten months. She started as a counter worker, received several promotions, and was ultimately made a supervisor. Toward the end of her employment, Washington received permission to take a leave of absence from work in order to undergo elective treatment for a skin condition. A dispute arose as to whether Washington or two other employees would receive a promotion. Dennis Paths claimed that one of the candidates, Tina Bennett (Bennett), told him that she had received a phone call from Washington and Washington\u2019s sister Matesia Berkley (Berkley) in which the two sisters threatened Bennett with violence. Dennis Paths fired Washington. The district court found that the threat of violence was the sole reason for Washington\u2019s discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1129-11\">At trial, Cynthia Trevino (Trevino), testified that Pico\u2019s had an unofficial policy of refusing to accept black employment applicants and that Dennis Paths used the word \u201cnigger.\u201d Trevino was one of the promotion candidates. She did not receive the promotion and she was later fired. The district court did not believe her testimony and found that she had committed perjury because she claimed to have heard conversations at Pico\u2019s which actually occurred after she was discharged. The district court concluded that Washington failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that she was discriminated against because of her race.</p>\n<p id=\"b1129-12\">II. Issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b1129-13\">A. Failure to address direct evidence of discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1129-14\">Washington argues that the district court discredited Trevino\u2019s testimony, but failed to consider Berkley\u2019s testimony and some of Washington\u2019s evidence. Washington does not argue that the district court\u2019s findings were clearly erroneous. Instead, she complains that they were not sufficiently detailed. This argument is without merit. The district court\u2019s findings were complete enough to afford a \u201creviewing court a clear understanding of the factual basis for the trial court\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Interfirst Bank of Abilene, N.A. v. Lull Mfg., </em>778 F.2d 228, 234 (5th Cir.1985). The district court was not requested to make supplemental findings nor was the court required to make specific findings on every bit of evidence in the record. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1129-15\">B. Erroneous finding of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b1129-16\">The district court made the following finding of fact: \u201cDefendant has demonstrated a lack of discriminatory animus in originally promoting Plaintiff. Defendant has articulated a nondiscriminatory reason for Plaintiff\u2019s discharge, i.e. the threat of violence to another employee.\u201d Washington argues that this finding is defective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1038\">*1038</page-number>because it refers to \u201cdefendant\u201d when in fact there were two defendants\u2014Tortillas and Dennis Patlis. Washington claims that the finding could not apply to Dennis Patlis because he did not work for Tortillas when Washington was promoted. This argument lacks merit. The finding obviously applies to both Tortillas and Dennis Patlis. We do not find it ambiguous or defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-4\">C. Motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-5\">The district court denied Washington\u2019s motion for a new trial under Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b). Washington claims that the recipient of the threats of violence, Tina Bennett, was unavailable at trial but has been located in another city and is now willing to testify on Washington\u2019s behalf. Washington claims that Bennett will testify about the threats she received and will corroborate Trevino\u2019s testimony on the alleged discrimination at Pico\u2019s. Washington therefore moved for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence under Rule 60(b)(2). She also claims that Bennett\u2019s testimony will demonstrate that Dennis Patlis committed perjury by testifying that Bennett told him that Washington and Berkley made threats to Bennett. Thus, Washington argues that a new trial is warranted on the basis of fraud under Rule 60(b)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-6\">A motion for a new trial under Rule 60(b) is an extraordinary motion. <em>Ag Pro, Inc. v. Sakraida, </em>512 F.2d 141, 143 (5th Cir.1975), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>425 U.S. 273, 96 S.Ct. 1532, 47 L.Ed.2d 784 (1976). \u201cThat spirit of finality which is implicit in all judgments, commands that courts be cautious in exercising the discretion vested in them to reopen proceedings for a new trial_\u201d <em>Id. </em>We will not overturn the district court's denial of a motion for a new trial absent an abuse of discretion. <em>Hand v. United States, </em>441 F.2d 529, 531 (5th Cir.1971). The court\u2019s discretion was not abused here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-8\">Washington\u2019s argument that Bennett\u2019s testimony justifies a new trial based on newly discovered evidence is without merit. First, Bennett\u2019s testimony is not newly discovered. Washington\u2019s affidavit of September 6, 1989 states that she spoke with Bennett about the threats of violence soon after Washington\u2019s discharge. Washington therefore had knowledge, before trial, of Bennett\u2019s identity and what her testimony would be. Washington did not move for a continuance in order to locate Bennett. These circumstances suggest that Washington believed that she could adequately present her case without Bennett\u2019s testimony. <em>See Hoyt R. Matise Co. v. Zurn, </em>754 F.2d 560, 568 n. 14 (5th Cir.1985). Washington\u2019s motion styled \u201cPlaintiff\u2019s Supplement to Motion for New Trial\u201d confirms this inference. It states: \u201cPlaintiffs production of Tina Bennett would have been at relatively great expense, and the production of the testimony would have been redundant_ Plaintiff wishes to expend greater effort than was previously thought justifiable, and the Court should reopen the testimony to allow it.\u201d The district court correctly declined and we will not allow a party to reopen litigation on the grounds that she \u201ccould not have foreseen that the district court would reject [her] claim without the testimony of [an] absent witness.\u201d <em>Zurn, </em>754 F.2d at 568 n. 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-11\">Second, Washington has failed to show that \u201ca new trial would produce a new result.\u201d <em>Ag Pro, </em>512 F.2d at 143. Aside from the fact that Bennett was fired from Pico\u2019s, the affidavits filed by Washington and her lawyer do not suggest that Dennis Patlis\u2019s testimony was materially untrue. Neither Washington\u2019s affidavit nor that of her lawyer states that Bennett would deny that she told Dennis Patlis that Washington threatened her.</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-12\">Washington argues that Berkley\u2019s trial testimony suggests that Bennett would deny receiving threats from Washington and Berkley. Berkley, however, only denied that she threatened Bennett. Berk-ley\u2019s testimony did not absolve Washington, and it did not address what Bennett told Dennis Patlis. Moreover, Washington never denied threatening Bennett even though she was recalled as a witness after Dennis Patlis had articulated his reasons for firing her. Washington has not shown <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1039\">*1039</page-number>that Bennett\u2019s testimony would produce a different result.</p>\n<p id=\"b1131-4\">Finally, Washington failed to demonstrate due diligence in attempting to locate Bennett. <em>See Ag Pro, </em>512 F.2d at 143. The only reference to due diligence in the record is Washington\u2019s affidavit of September 6, 1989 which states that Bennett\u2019s former husband told Washington that Bennett was residing in Indianapolis, that Washington wrote a single letter to Bennett, and that Washington tried to obtain Bennett\u2019s telephone number by calling information. Washington\u2019s motion styled \u201cPlaintiff\u2019s Supplement to Motion for New Trial,\u201d quoted <em>supra, </em>indicates that she and her lawyer decided not to make further attempts to locate Bennett. Washington cannot now complain of injustice when she neither moved for a continuance nor made a reasonably diligent effort to locate her missing witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b1131-5\">Washington\u2019s argument that Bennett\u2019s testimony justifies a new trial based on fraud is also without merit. A party making a Rule 60(b)(3) motion must \u201cestablish by clear and convincing evidence (1) that the adverse party engaged in fraud or other misconduct and (2) that this misconduct prevented the moving party from fully and fairly presenting his case.\u201d <em>Montgomery v. Hall, </em>592 F.2d 278, 278-79 (5th Cir.1979). Washington has done neither. At best, the affidavits filed by Washington and her lawyer suggest that Bennett\u2019s testimony might contradict some of Dennis Patlis\u2019s testimony at trial. They do not approach clear and convincing evidence of fraud or misconduct. Furthermore, Washington had every opportunity to fully and fairly present her case. Washington\u2019s claim that she has new evidence of alleged perjury is more properly addressed under Rule 60(b)(2) which covers newly discovered evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1131-6\">The claim that a new trial is justified because Bennett will provide additional testimony regarding allegedly discriminatory hiring practices at Pico\u2019s is also without merit. Trevino testified about the allegedly discriminatory hiring practices at trial, and the district court found that she was not credible. Her offer to put on additional testimony regarding discriminatory hiring is meritless because such evidence would be merely cumulative. <em>See Ag Pro, </em>512 F.2d at 143.</p>\n<p id=\"b1131-8\">D. Costs taxed to an <em>in forma pauper-is </em>Title VII plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b1131-9\">Washington argues that the district court erred by taxing costs against her. When a party proceeds <em>in forma pauperis, </em>\u201c[\u00bfjudgment may be rendered for costs at the conclusion of the suit or action as in other cases_\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e). However, for <em>in forma pauperis </em>litigants, a federal court \u201cmay authorize the commencement, prosecution or defense of any suit, action or proceeding ... without prepayment of fees and costs or security therefor....\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a). We have held that the quoted statutory language indicates that Congress intended for qualified litigants to be able to proceed without advancing costs, but that they may be ultimately liable for costs. <em>Lay v. Anderson, </em>837 F.2d 231, 232 (5th Cir.1988) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b1131-12\">Washington argues that the \u201cas in other cases\u201d language of section 1915(e) refers to Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(d) which provides that \u201c[ejxcept when express provision therefor is made either in a statute of the United States or in these rules, costs shall be allowed as of course to the prevailing party unless the court otherwise directs.... \u201d Washington further argues that Title VII contains an exception to Rule 54(d). Title VII provides: \u201cUpon application by the complainant and in such circumstances as the court may deem just, the court may ... authorize the commencement of the action without payment of fees, costs, or security.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(f)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b1131-13\">We hold that the district court did not err by taxing costs to Washington for two reasons. First, Title VII provides the district court with discretion regarding whether to tax costs to a complainant. Washington does not argue that the district court abused its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1132-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1040\">*1040</page-number>Second, it is apparent that the effect of section 2000e-5(f)(l) of Title VII is the same as the effect of section 1915(a). The language in the two statutes is very similar. The major difference is that section 1915(a) contains the word \u201cprepayment,\u201d whereas Title VII uses the word \u201cpayment.\u201d This is a distinction without a difference. Section 1915(a) permits a court to authorize \u201cthe commencement, prosecution or defense of any suit, action or proceeding\u201d without prepayment of costs. Title VII permits \u201cthe commencement of the action\u201d without payment of costs. Section 1915(a) covers all phases of litigation. Thus, \u201cprepayment\u201d evidences an intention for <em>in forma pauperis </em>litigants to remain potentially liable for costs through \u201cprosecution or defense\u201d of any suit. By contrast, Title VII, which contains the word \u201cpayment,\u201d relates only to the commencement of the action. Title VII does not make an exception to the general rule that federal courts may award costs to the prevailing party under Rule 54(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1132-4\">III.
