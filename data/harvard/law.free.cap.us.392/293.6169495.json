S. 123, decided May 20, 1968, we overruled <em>Delli Paoli </em>v. <em>United States, </em>352 U. S. 232, and held that, despite instructions to the jury to disregard the implicating statements in determining the codefendant\u2019s guilt or innocence, admission at a joint trial of a defendant\u2019s extrajudicial confession implicating a codefendant violated the codefendant\u2019s right of cross-examination secured by the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment. This case presents the question whether <em>Bruton </em>is to be applied retroactively. We hold that it is.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-12\">The facts parallel the facts in <em>Bruton. </em>The petitioner was convicted by a jury of armed robbery at a joint trial with one Rappe in Davidson County, Tennessee. A police officer testified that Rappe orally confessed to him that petitioner and Rappe committed the crime. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>The trial judge instructed the jury that Rappe\u2019s confession was admissible against her but that her statements implicating petitioner were not to be considered in determining petitioner's guilt or innocence. The Tennessee Supreme Court affirmed petitioner\u2019s conviction. Petitioner filed a proceeding in federal habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee. That court relied on <em>Delli Paoli </em>and denied relief. The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">Although <em>Bruton </em>involved a federal prosecution and this is a state prosecution, the right of cross-examination secured by the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment is made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>Pointer </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>380 U. S. 400; <em>Douglas </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>380 U. S. 416.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">\u201cWe have . . . retroactively applied rules of criminal procedure fashioned to correct serious flaws in the fact-finding process at trial.\u201d <em>Stovall </em>v. <em>Denno, </em>388 U. S. 293, 298. See <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Denno, </em>378 U. S. 368; <em>Gideon </em>v. <em>Wainwright, </em>372 U. S. 335; <em>Reck </em>v. <em>Pate, </em>367 U. S. 433; <em>Linkletter </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>381 U. S. 618, 639, n. 20; <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>New Jersey, </em>384 U. S. 719, 727-728; cf. <em>Brookhart </em>v. <em>Janis, </em>384 U. S. 1. Despite the cautionary instruction, the admission of a defendant's confession which implicates a codefendant results in such a \u201cserious flaw.\u201d The retroactivity of the holding in <em>Bruton </em>is therefore required; the error \u201cwent to the basis of fair hearing and trial because the procedural apparatus never assured the [petitioner] a fair determination\u201d of his guilt or innocence. <em>Linkletter </em>v. <em>Walker, supra, </em>at 639, n. 20. As we said in <em>Bruton:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-7\">\u201c[T]here are some contexts in which the risk that the jury will not, or cannot, follow instructions is so great, and the consequences of failure so vital to the defendant, that the practical and human limitations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>of the jury system cannot be ignored. . . . Such a context is presented here, where the powerfully incriminating extrajudicial statements of a code-fendant . . . are deliberately spread before the jury in a joint trial.\u201d 391 U. S., at 135-136.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">Due regard for countervailing considerations \u2014 reliance on the old standard of <em>Delli Paoli </em>and the impact of retroactivity upon the administration of justice, <em>Stovall </em>v. <em>Denno, supra, </em>at 298 \u2014 does not counsel against retroactivity of <em>Bruton. </em>The element of reliance is not persuasive, for <em>Delli Paoli </em>has been under attack from its inception and many courts have in fact rejected it. See <em>Bruton </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>at 128-135 and nn. 4, 8, 10. And even if the impact of retroactivity may be significant, the constitutional error presents a serious risk that the issue of guilt or innocence may not have been reliably determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">The motion for leave to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>and the petition for writ of certiorari are granted. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated and the case is remanded to the District Court for further consideration in light of <em>Bruton </em>v. <em>United States, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">\n<em>It is so ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b337-8\">Mr. Justice Black concurs in the Court's holding as to retroactivity for the reasons given in his dissent in <em>Linkletter </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>381 U. S. 618, 640, and not for the reasons given in the Court\u2019s opinion today.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b337-9\">Mr. Justice Harlan and Mr. Justice White dissent for the reasons stated in Mr. Justice White\u2019s dissenting opinion in <em>Bruton </em>v. <em>United States, </em>391 U. S. 123, 138 (1968).</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
