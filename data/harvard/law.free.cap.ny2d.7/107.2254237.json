Section 1290-a of the Penal Law prohibits reception of evidence of conversations between complainant and defendant which tend to prove a larceny by false pretenses. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Lobel, </em>298 N. Y. 243.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b152-5\">Froessel, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A0z\">Defendant was convicted of grand larceny in the first degree, and sentenced as a prior felony offender to imprisonment for not less than 10 nor more than 20 years. The Appellate Division reversed upon the law alone, and ordered a new trial. The only question before us on this appeal is whether the trial court \u2014 over the repeated objections of the defense \u2014 improperly received evidence of false or fraudulent representations or pretenses, in violation of section 1290-a of the Penal Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">In 1942 (L. 1942, ch. 732), the Legislature abolished \u201cthe subtle and confusing distinctions that had previously differentiated the various types of theft \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Karp, </em>298 N. Y. 213, 216). The 1950 amendment (L. 1950, ch. 149) of section 1290-a made it perfectly clear that the Legislature did not intend to preserve these distinctions for the purpose of determining whether false or fraudulent representations or pretenses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>had to be pleaded in the indictment (see New York State Legislative Annual, 1950, pp. 54-55; Judge Fuld\u2019s dissenting opinion in <em>People </em>v. <em>Lobel, </em>298 N. Y. 243, decided under former \u00a7 1290-a). This amendment unequivocally provided that the necessity for alleging false representations in the indictment was not limited to thefts previously prosecuted under the label \u201c obtaining property by false pretenses \u201d, but encompassed every case in which the defendant \u201cmade use of any false or fraudulent representation or pretence, in the course of accomplishing, or in aid of, or in facilitating the theft</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">In the instant case, the defendant \u201cmade use of\u201d at least two false representations \u201cin the course of accomplishing, or in aid of, or in facilitating the theft \u2019 \u2019, neither of which representations was alleged in the indictment, and evidence of which was improperly received over the repeated objections of defendant\u2019s attorney. Hence the conviction was properly reversed and a new trial ordered, and it is now incumbent upon the People to \u2018 <em>\u2018 </em>determine whether to retry the case on the present indictment\u2014 and desist from offering proof of false representation \u2014 or to seek a new indictment alleging the essential false representation and pretense \u201d (dissenting opinion in <em>People </em>v. <em>Lobel, supra, </em>p. 262). As the Appellate Division correctly noted in this connection, a new indictment would not be subject to dismissal on the ground of double jeopardy <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ercole, </em>4 N Y 2d 617).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">The order appealed from should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">Chief Judge Conway and Judges Desmond, Dye, Fuld, Van Voorhis and Burke concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">Order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
