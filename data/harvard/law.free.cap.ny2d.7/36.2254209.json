The only possible question on this appeal is as to the sufficiency of the proof of the statutory element: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>\u2018 \u2018 iii the event any other traffic may be affected by such movement \u201d (Vehicle and Traffic Law, \u00a7 1163, subd. [a]). The record shows that the police officer supplied that proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">The officer swore that he could see about 700 feet to the east (from which direction defendant\u2019s car came) and that there were automobiles behind defendant coming from that easterly direction. The policeman did not know just how far away those other cars were but they were, of course, within his 700 feet of visibility. If, just before defendant made his unsignalcd turn, those cars behind him were moving no faster than 25 miles per hour, they would, when defendant suddenly and without notice slowed and turned, come up behind defendant in 15 or 20 seconds, at most. His was, therefore, precisely the kind of heedless driving with which the statute deals.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">On defendant\u2019s own testimony, this was not a situation where there was no traffic at all on the street. He himself testified that shortly before he turned he had to wait for other cars coming into the street and that he had to slow up to let them pass. If all this does not make out a violation, it must be that there is no violation without an actual collision.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">In the month in which this appeal was argued (October, 1959) there were 231 highway deaths in this State. The times call for tight, not loose, application of these simple, easy-to-obey traffic rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">The judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b81-9\">Bubke, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ap\">(dissenting). We do not find sufficient evidence in the record to indicate a violation of section 1163 of the Vehicle and Traffic Law (failure to signal). That section reads in part: \u201c No person shall so turn any vehicle without giving an appropriate signal in the manner hereinafter provided <em>in the event any other traffic may be affected by such </em>movement.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b81-10\">The underlying purpose of the Vehicle and Traffic Law is order and safety. There is no question that the requirements pertaining to manual and mechanical signals contribute significantly to this stated object. However, the requirements of each section must be given a reasonable construction in the light of legislative intent and the surrounding facts and circumstances. The pertinent provision of the section of the statute we are considering is self-explanatory. It evidently requires an appro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>priate signal, not under any and all circumstances, but only in the event that other traffic may be affected by such movement. This is also apparent from an examination of a complementary section of the Vehicle and Traffic Law, which, prior to the enactment of section 1163, required, <em>without qualification, </em>the use of directional signals when making <em>any </em>turn. (Vehicle and Traffic Law, \u00a7 15, subd. 18.) However, with the enactment of section 1163 (L. 1957, ch. 698), subdivision 18 of section 15 was amended so as to omit this unqualified provision (Vehicle and Traffic Law, \u00a7 15, subd. 18, as amd. by L. 1957, ch. 698, \u00a7 18). The Legislature has, therefore, made express its recognition of the fact that there may be instances when no signal is required. Of course, while this may more frequently take place in the less densely populated and lightly traveled areas of the State, it may indeed occur anywhere.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">In order to obtain a conviction under the statute, therefore, the proof must show beyond a reasonable doubt not only that appellant failed to give a signal before turning, and the existence of other traffic, <em>hut also the presence of other traffic that might he affected hy such movement.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">The proof of the elements of the violation involved depend solely on the testimony of the patrolman. On direct examination he made <em>no reference </em>to any other traffic in the area concerned. Indeed, as is apparent from the record, the patrolman was under the erroneous assumption that evidence of a mere failure to signal was sufficient to establish a violation. Under cross-examination by the appellant, the officer\u2019s testimony was vague, inconclusive and evasive. Although he testified that there were vehicles proceeding west behind appellant, he could not, or would not, estimate their distance, despite the fact that he earlier admitted an unobstructed view of approximately 700 fe'et. In response to questions regarding traffic conditions on Richmond Avenue, the officer\u2019s frank admission was \u201cI don\u2019t know \u2019 \u2019.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">The only evidence from which an inference might be drawn of the existence of other traffic at times is the fact that six traffic lights were situated at the intersection. However, the incident in question took place on a Sunday afternoon in February, and the appellant unequivocally testified that there were no moving vehicles following or approaching him.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>We do\" not believe the proof offered by the People establishes appellant\u2019s guilt <em>beyond a reasonable doubt. </em>Even if the officer\u2019s testimony were given a most favorable interpretation, there is still a lack of sufficient evidence of a most essential element (i.e., affected traffic) of the violation in question. The express language of the statute indicates the circumstance under which it is applicable. While it obviously encompasses more than merely heavy traffic, it is.equally obvious that it has no application when there is no affected traffic. In view of the fact that this distinction was totally disregarded, an affirmance of the conviction would be a subversion of the express intention of the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">Accordingly, the judgment appealed from should be reversed and the complaint dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">Chief Judge Conway and Judges Dye and Fboessel concur with Judge Desmond; Judge Bubke dissents in an opinion in which Judges Fuld and Van Voobhis concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
