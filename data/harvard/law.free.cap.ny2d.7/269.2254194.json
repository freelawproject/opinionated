Defendant\u2019s liability on the unchallenged evidence is imposed by Federal statute and Federal law is controlling on the right to substitute another as the personal representative of the deceased in these actions. But, even if State law controls, the actions did not abate and there can be a substitution. <em>(Matter of Wenkhous, </em>158 Misc. 663; <em>Mumma </em>v. <em>Philadelphia &amp; R. Ry. Co., </em>275 Pa. 277; <em>Keith </em>v. <em>Texas &amp; P. Ry. Co., </em>171 La. 757; <em>Wabash Ry. Co. </em>v. <em>Bridal, </em>94 F. 2d 117; <em>New York Cent. R.

S. 630; <em>Cincinnati, New Orleans &amp; Texas Pacific Ry. Co. </em>v. <em>Goode, </em>163 Ky. 60.) II. Plaintiff did not fraudulently invoke the jurisdiction of the Surrogate\u2019s Court and, therefore, its jurisdiction to issue letters of administration to her is conclusively established and cannot be collaterally attacked. <em>(Lapiedra </em>v. <em>American Sur. Co., </em>247 N. Y. 25; <em>People </em>v. <em>Federated Road Ccorp., </em>244 N. Y. 33; <em>O\u2019Connor </em>v. <em>Huggins, </em>113 N. Y. 511.) III. Whether plaintiff was legally the widow of decedent was not made an issue in this action and defendant should not have been heard to challenge the validity of the marriage. If such issue was properly made a subject of this litigation, insufficient evidence was adduced to overcome the presumption of the validity of the marriage. <em>(Rapee </em>v. <em>Beacon Hotel Corp., </em>293 N.

Since the appointment of plaintiff as administratrix was void by reason of constructive fraud, it was subject to collateral attack and, therefore, the action was abortive as she lacked capacity to maintain it. <em>(Ziemer </em>v. <em>Crucible Steel Co., </em>99 App. Div. 169; <em>Webster </em>v. <em>Kellogg Co., </em>168 App. Div. 443; <em>Lapiedra </em>v. <em>American Sur.

The order denying plaintiff\u2019s motion made subsequent to the entry of judgment is not before this court for review. <em>(Vendall </em>v. <em>Briscoe, </em>3 N Y 2d 932; <em>Englander Co. </em>v. <em>Tishler, </em>309 N.

In any event, no motion to substitute a properly appointed administrator has ever been made and, if it were, no such substitution could be made. <em>(Central Vermont Ry. </em>v. <em>White, </em>238 U.

The Statute of Limitations is not here involved and, if it should be in a subsequent action brought by a validly appointed estate representative, no prejudice would result to plaintiff or her daughter, and none has by the judgment herein because neither is a beneficiary under the Federal Employers \u2019 Liability Act. <em>(De Sylva </em>v. <em>Ballentine, </em>351 U. S. 570; <em>Poff </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania R. R. Co., </em>327 U. S. 399; <em>Seaboard Air Line </em>v. <em>Kenney, </em>240 U. S. 489; <em>Hiser </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>234 N.

Y. 446; <em>Matter of Tomacelli-Filomarino, </em>189 Misc. 410; <em>Matter of Vincent, </em>189 Misc. 489.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b316-4\">Fboessel, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A2F\">These consolidated actions, one for wrongful death and the other for pain and suffering, were instituted by plaintiff, as administratrix of the estate of Henry G-. Stolz, under the Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act (U. S. Code, tit. 45, \u00a7\u00a7 51-60, hereinafter referred to as the F.E.L.A.). The complaints were dismissed below on the ground that plaintiff lacked capacity to sue, but \u201c without prejudice to the commencement of a new action by an administrator validly appointed as such \u201d. This dismissal took place more than four months <em>after </em>the limitation period prescribed by section 56 of the F.E.L.A.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">In her petition to the Surrogate for letters of administration, plaintiff represented herself to be the widow of decedent. The courts below held that she was not decedent\u2019s lawful widow at that time since her marriage to decedent was void. (See discussion below 6 A D 2d 643, 645; <em>Merrick </em>v. <em>Merrick, </em>266 N. Y. 120; <em>Beaudoin </em>v. <em>Beaudoin, </em>270 App. Div. 631; <em>De Santis </em>v. <em>De Santis, </em>20 Misc 2d 16; Domestic Relations Law, \u00a7 6, subd. 1; \u00a78.) Hence it was reasoned that her appointment as administratrix was invalid and she lacked the capacity to bring these actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">By declaring plaintiff\u2019s appointment invalid and thereupon dismissing these actions, Trial Term appropriated to itself certain discretionary powers which the Legislature confided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>only in the Surrogate. In sections 99-101 of the Surrogate\u2019s Court Act, the Legislature recognized that revocation of letters calls for the exercise of a discriminating discretion by the Surrogate. Section 99 provides for the revocation of letters in 10 enumerated situations. The first situation enumerated is:</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">\u2018 \u2018 Where the' respondent was, when appointed or when letters were issued to him * * * disqualified by law to act as such, and the * * * objection was not taken by the petitioner, or a person whom he represents, before the letters were granted or the appointment made.\u201d The fourth situation enumerated is: <em>\u201c </em>Where the grant of his letters, or his appointment was obtained by a false suggestion of a material fact.\u201d Under the express language of section 101, the revocation of letters is purely discretionary (see <em>Matter of Clark, </em>136 Misc. 459; <em>Matter of Chinsky, </em>159 Misc. 591, 596; Withrow, New Surrogates\u2019 Code [Supp. to Redfield\u2019s &amp; Jessup\u2019s Surrogates\u2019 Practice, 7th ed.], p. 92).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">In <em>Matter of Clark (supra) </em>a proceeding was instituted for removal of a statutory trustee under section 94 and subdivision 1 of section 99 of the Surrogate\u2019s Court Act. The court held, in light of section 101 of said act and its statutory history, that removal of the trustee was discretionary under sections 99-101. The holding applies with equal force to revocation of letters. In an exceedingly well-reasoned opinion, Surrogate Close traced the history of sections 99-101 of the Surrogate\u2019s Court Act and pointed out that under the predecessor provision of section 101, namely, section 2687 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the revocation of letters was <em>mandatory </em>except in three enumerated situations, not relevant here, in which cases it was discretionary. The effect of section 101, however, was to abolish the previous mandatory provisions and to allow the Surrogate in every case to exercise his discretion. <em>1 </em>\u2018 When enacting the aforesaid sections the Legislature, of course, had in mind the prudent administration and preservation of estates and trust property. It clearly anticipated that a condition might exist or a situation arise where it would not be advisable to revoke letters issued to or remove from office a fiduciary # * \\ Unquestionably the Legislature deemed it wise to leave the disposition of such matters wholly to the discretion of the surrogate, so that each particular case could be judged by its own peculiar circumstances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>and conditions and disposed of, in the words of the statute, \u2018 as justice requires. \u2019 \u201d <em>(Matter of Clark, supra, </em>p. 463.)</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">In these actions for wrongful death and for pain and suffering-plain tiff is a mere nominal party. She sues not on her own behalf but as a statutory trustee for the benefit of those persons designated by sections 52 and 59 of the F. E. L. A. <em>(Lindgren </em>v. <em>United States, </em>281 U. S. 38, 41; <em>Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy R. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Wells-Dickey Trust Co., 275 </em>U. S. 161, 163; <em>Stark </em>v. <em>Chicago, North Shore &amp; Milwaukee Ry. Co., </em>203 F. 2d 786, 787; see <em>Hamilton </em>v. <em>Erie R. R. Co., </em>219 N. Y. 343, 350; <em>Davis </em>v. <em>New York Cent. S H. R. R. R. Co., </em>233 N. Y. 242, 246; <em>Winbush </em>v. <em>City of Mt. Vernon, </em>306 N. Y. 327, 334). A recovery necessarily accrues to the benefit of these designated beneficiaries. Hence the Surrogate, in the exercise of his discretion, even if he found that plaintiff was not entitled to letters on the original application, could have permitted plaintiff to proceed with this litigation upon her limited letters, by which she was already \u2018 <em>\u2018 </em>restrained from compromising said action and from enforcing-any Judgment recovered therein until the further order of the Surrogate \u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">Here, the Trial Judge not only improperly exercised the discretion which the Legislature reposed in the Surrogate\u2019s Court but, indeed, he virtually assumed there was no room for the exercise of any discretion. When at the close of the trial he was alerted to the fact that there was a question as to the validity of plaintiff\u2019s appointment, he should have recognized that the Surrogate, with full knowledge of the facts, could have authorized the administratrix to continue these actions. It was, therefore, error to dismiss them. Instead, the trial should have been suspended until such time as plaintiff, or any other person interested, made an appropriate application to the Surrogate\u2019s Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">The courts below erroneously relied on section 43 of the Surrogate\u2019s Court Act without reference to sections 99-101 of said act, and thus pre-empted the Surrogate of his jurisdiction and discretion in this matter. The Surrogate at all times had valid jurisdiction over the subject matter of decedent\u2019s estate, including the appointment of a legal representative. If he made a mistake in the exercise of his power derived from his <em>jurisdiction </em>over the subject matter, it cannot be collaterally attacked. That jurisdiction, according to section 43, is conclusive <em>\u201c </em>in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>absence of fraud or collusion \u2019 \u2019. This court has previously construed and applied section 43 in <em>Lapiedra </em>v. <em>American Sur. Co. </em>(247 N. Y. 25) and <em>Hoes </em>v. <em>New York, N. H. &amp; H. R. R. Co. </em>(173 N. Y. 435), where the type of fraud or collusion which permitted collateral attack of the Surrogate\u2019s decree was of the kind which went to the very essence of its jurisdiction over the subject matter. In the instant case, plaintiff, in her petition to the Surrogate, misrepresented \u2014 however innocently \u2014 a material fact. However, that misrepresentation or constructive fraud did not go to the essence of the Surrogate\u2019s jurisdiction over the subject matter, for the Legislature empowered the Surrogate, notwithstanding that misrepresentation, to retain plaintiff as administratrix, within his discretion, under subdivisions 1 and 4 of section 99, and section 101 of the Surrogate\u2019s Court Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">In addition to the foregoing, a suspension, rather than a dismissal, of this lawsuit is dictated by the intrinsic character of the action here involved and by Federal precedent in related situations under the F.E.L.A. It is clear that if plaintiff is not the lawful widow of decedent she could not share in any future recovery as a beneficiary under the Federal statute. A <em>dismissal </em>of these actions would consequently not prejudice her individually in any respect. It would, however, if the limitation period barred future actions, prejudice the rights of the ultimate beneficiaries and promote a windfall for defendant railroad. A suspension of these actions, however, pending action by the Surrogate\u2019s Court \u2014 which may be the retention of plaintiff as administratrix or the appointment of a new administrator who could be substituted as party plaintiff in these suspended actions \u2014within a reasonable time, would preserve the rights of the ultimate beneficiaries since these actions were timely brought in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">The Supreme Court of the United States has by its decisions approved substitution of a legal representative as the proper party plaintiff even after the limitation period prescribed by the F.E.L.A., thus preserving timely brought actions (see <em>St. Louis, San Francisco &amp; Texas Ry. Co. </em>v. <em>Seale, </em>229 U. S. 156, and its subsequent history, 160 S. W. 317 [Tex.], 171 S. W. 512 [Tex.], affd. 243 U. S. 630; <em>Missouri, K. &amp; T. Ry. Co. </em>v. <em>Wulf, </em>226 U. S. 570 [referred to with approval in <em>Van der Stegen </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number><em>Neuss, Heslein &amp; Co., </em>270 N. Y. 55, 62-63]; see, also, <em>Seaboard Air Line </em>v. <em>Renn, </em>241 U. S. 290, 293; <em>Olsen </em>v. <em>United States Nav. Co., </em>20 Misc 2d 14).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">We have utilized the procedure of suspension in order to prevent abatement of actions where the plaintiff had died during the pendency of the action (see <em>Angelo </em>v. <em>Angelo, </em>282 App. Div. 981). This policy against abatement, articulated in <em>Angelo (supra) </em>also finds expression in sections 88 and 90 of the Civil Practice Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">Accordingly, the courts below were in error in dismissing these actions and thus disposing of the rights of beneficiaries, who were not before the court. The judgment appealed from should be reversed, with costs, and the matter remitted to the Supreme Court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. Insofar as plaintiff seeks to appeal from the order of the Appellate Division affirming Trial Term\u2019s denial of the motion to vacate, so much of the appeal is dismissed for lack of finality and the failure of the Appellate Division to certify a specific question.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">Chief Judge Conway and Judges Desmond, Dye, Fuld, Van Voorhis and. Burke concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">Judgment reversed, with costs in all courts, and the matter remitted to the Supreme Court, Albany County, for further proceedings not inconsistent with the opinion herein. Appeal from the order insofar as it affirms the denial of the motion to vacate dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
