The definition of <em>\u201c </em>financial business \u201d in the State Enabling Act precludes the city from so classifying a holding company such as petitioner. <em>(Genet </em>v. <em>City of Brooklyn, </em>99 N.

Corp. </em>v. <em>Board of Assessors, </em>2 N Y 2d 500.) II. The history of the statute confirms that the State Legislature did not intend to permit taxation of holding companies as \u201c financial business \u201d, <em>(Holmes Elec. Protective Co. </em>v. <em>City of New York, </em>304 N. Y. 202; <em>Fox </em>v. <em>Standard Oil Co., </em>294 U. S. 87; <em>Carey </em>v. <em>Donohue, </em>240 U. S. 430.) III. The Comptroller does not have the power to classify petitioner as a \u201c financial business \u201d. <em>(Addison </em>v. <em>Holly Hill, </em>322 U. S. 607; <em>Dun &amp; Bradstreet </em>v. <em>City of New York, </em>276 N. Y. 198; <em>Matter of Emigrant Ind. Sav.

The assessment made cannot be sustained on the theory that, if illegal, it is less than the amount which legally might have been assessed. <em>(People ex rel. Manila Elec. R. R. &amp; Light.

The Comptroller is required to allocate dividends and interest received from controlled subsidiaries for purposes of both financial business tax and general business tax, and his regulations are invalid which require allocation to New York City of a minimum of 12%% for purposes of financial business tax. VI. Penalties and penalty interest were improperly and illegally assessed. <em>(Matter of McCall Corp. </em>v. <em>Gerosa, </em>2 A D 2d 358; <em>Matter of Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corp. </em>v. <em>Gerosa, </em>8 A D 2d 714.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b500-4\"><em>Charles H.

In the event appellant is not taxable as a financial business, it necessarily follows that it must be taxed as a general business. <em>(People ex rel. Farrington </em>v. <em>Mensching, </em>187 N.

Neither the due process clause nor the commerce clause of the Federal Constitution requires that a tax on the gross income or the gross receipts of appellant be allocated. Since allocation is unnecessary the tax can be imposed upon all of the income or receipts and, therefore, an allocation formula cannot be attacked on the ground that it fixes a minimum percentage to which the tax applies. <em>(Matter of Gulf Oil Corp. </em>v. <em>Joseph, </em>307 N. Y. 342; <em>Hawley </em>v. <em>Malden, </em>232 U. S. 1; <em>New York ex rel. Cohn </em>v. <em>Graves, </em>300 U. S. 308; <em>Welch </em>v. <em>Henry, </em>305 U.

The Comptroller had the right to impose penalties for the failure to pay the full amount of the tax due. <em>(Matter of Underpinning &amp; Foundation Co. </em>v. <em>Gerosa, </em>3 A D 2d 415, 3 N Y 2d 707; <em>Matter of New York World-Tel. Corp. </em>v. <em>McGoldrick, </em>272 App. Div. 806, 298 N. Y. 11; <em>Matter of Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corp. </em>v. <em>Gerosa, </em>8 A D 2d 714.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b501-4\">Dye, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AKZ\">On this appeal from an order unanimously confirming a partial final determination by which respondent imposed upon United States Steel Corporation an assessment for a business tax deficiency for the years 1948, 1949 and 1950, in the principal amount of $176,767.28 plus penalties and interest totaling $144,388.62, the narrow question for decision is whether the prevailing <em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>financial business \u201d rate was the proper rate to use.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">United States Steel is a New Jersey Corporation licensed to do business in New York and having its principal office at 71 Broadway, Ngav York City. During the tax years involved, it concededly functioned as a holding company, doing no other business than that of holding the stock of subsidiary operating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>ciompanies whos'e operative efforts it co-ordinated and supervised and at times financed in whole or in part. In turn, all dividends and interest on securities of the subsidiary companies were'paid to Steel at its New York office, and all such moneys, including securities, were deposited and held in New York banks. From time to time, as required by statute or by-laws, United States Steel made consolidated reports to stockholders and public agencies, and filed tax returns. Under protest, it filed a timely business and financial tax return for each of the controverted years, reporting its tax on approximately <em>2% </em>of \u2018 \u2018 gross income \u2019 \u2019.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">The deficiency assessment was made on an allocation to New York City of 12%% of the gross income received, and at the \u201cfinancial business\u201d rate of two fifths of 1%. The parties stipulated below that, had respondent elected to treat United States Steel as a \u201cgeneral business \u201d, and to apply the then prevailing \u201c general business \u201d rate of one fifth of 1% to \u201c gross receipts \u201d, <em>without allocation, </em>the principal tax would have amounted to $808,379.91. But, apart from its contention that it is entitled to be treated as a \u201c general business,\u2019\u2019 United States Steel has never conceded that the tax could have been imposed upon the basis of the entire gross receipts, without regard to apportionment.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">Section 24-a of th% New York State General City Law (art. 2-B, General Business an! Financial Tax Authorization) authorizes the local legislators oi any city with a population of over one million or more to adopt or amend local laws \u201cimposing in any such city a tax upon persons carrying on or exercising for gain or profit within such city, any trade, business, profession, vocation or commercial activity * * * or making sales within such city\u201d at a rate \u201cnot to exceed one-fifth of o.ne per centum * * * and upon persons carrying on * * * any \u2018 financial business \u2019 \u201d at a rate \u201c not to exceed two-fifths of one per centum \u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-9\">A \u2018 \u2018 financial business \u2019 \u2019 is defined as including certain named categories of activities, to wit: <em>\u201c 2. \u2018 </em>Financial Business. The services and transactions of private banks, private bankers, dealers and brokers in money, credits, commercial paper, bonds, notes, securities -and stocks, monetary metals, factors, and commission merchants \u201d (General City Law, \u00a7 24-a .[\u00a7\u00a7 1, 2] ).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>Local Law No. 44 of 1948 of New York City, enacted pursuant to the State enabling statute, contains identical language except for the addition of the words <em>1 \u2018 </em>holding companies \u201d (Administrative Code, \u00a7 B46-1.0 [ch. 46, tit. B]). It is this difference in language that respondent points to as authority for classifying the taxpayer as a \u201c financial business \u2019 \u2019 and that the taxpayer points to in support of its challenge to the classification.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\">It is clear that holding companies are not included in the definition of \u201cfinancial business \u201d contained in section 24-a, and that this omission indicates a legislative intent to preclude the City of New York from taxing the gross income of a holding company at the \u201c financial business \u201d rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">In New York, the State Legislature has the exclusive power to tax, including the power to determine the class of persons to he taxed (N. Y. Const., art. Ill, \u00a7 1; <em>Genet </em>v. <em>City of Brooklyn, </em>99 N. Y. 296; <em>Gautier </em>v. <em>Ditmar, </em>204 N. Y. 20), which it may delegate to its municipal subdivisions, including the City of New York. But any taxes imposed by the latter must be within the expressed limitations <em>(County Securities </em>v. <em>Seacord, </em>278 N. Y. 34) and, unless authorized, a tax so levied is constitutionally invalid <em>(Matter of Long Is. R. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Hylan, </em>240 N. Y. 199). It is equally well settled that the Legislature may classify property for tax purposes in any manner it deems proper <em>(People ex rel. Hudson Riv. Day Line </em>v. <em>Franck, </em>257 N. Y. 69). Its power in that regard is not without limitation, for the classification must have some reasonable basis <em>(People ex rel. Farrington </em>v. <em>Mensching, </em>187 N. Y. 8). In this instance the State Legislature expressly stated that the classification \u2018 \u2018 shall mean or include\u201d a list of named special classes of business (General City Law, art. 2-B, \u00a7 24-a [\u00a7\u00a7 1, 2]), thereby evidencing an intention to restrict the application of the tax to the categories listed <em>(Jackson </em>v. <em>Citizens Cas. Co. of N. Y., </em>277 N. Y. 385) and to exclude any business activity not so included. So viewed, the classification \u201c financial business \u201d in the State Enabling Act indicates an intention to preclude the city from classifying this taxpayer as a \u201c financial business \u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">If there is any doubt that the Legislature so intended to exclude holding companies as \u201c financial business \u201d, and we think there is none, the history of the Enabling Act points to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>same result. The original enabling statute was enacted in 1934, and annually re-enacted. In 1941 it included a model local law, patterned on the then existing New York City law imposing the General Business and Financial Tax. In 1942 the New York City law included for the first time the term \u2018 \u2018 holding companies \u201d in its definition, but the Comptroller has since 1934 issued regulations treating holding companies as financial businesses. From this background information, the Comptroller reasons that the re-enactments of the enabling statute from 1934 through 1941 constituted a confirmation of the administrative construction. While it is true that repeated re-enactment points to legislative favoring of reasonable administrative interpretation <em>(McFeely </em>v. <em>Commissioner, </em>296 U. S. 102 [1935]; <em>Helvering </em>v. <em>Reynolds Co., </em>306 U. S. 110 [1939]; <em>Wilmette Park Dist. </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>338 U. S. 411 [1949]; <em>Matter of Stupack, </em>274 N. Y. 198 [1937]), we ought not to attribute such an attitude to the Legislature\u2019s silence in this area. <em>First, </em>the administrative construction was unreasonable under the circumstances. <em>Second, </em>from 1942 forward, the Legislature failed to add \u201cholding companies \u201d to its definition, despite the city\u2019s attempts to induce such an amendment (Assembly Int. No. 3519 and Senate Int. No. 3124, New York Legislative Record and Index, 180th Session, beginning January 9, 1957; Assembly Int. No. 3725 and Senate Int. No. 3186, New York Legislative Record and Index, 181st Session, beginning January 8, 1958). <em>Third, </em>the Legislature did include <em>\u20181 </em>holding companies \u2019 \u2019 in the definition of financial business contained in the enabling statute authorizing cities with a population of <em>fewer </em>than one million to impose a general business and financial tax similar to the New York City tax (L. 1948, ch. 651, amdg. L. 1947, ch. 278).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">In the light of this historic background, the State Legislature clearly never intended to give the city authority to include holding companies in the definition of \u201cfinancial business\u201d. Thus the Comptroller assessed the deficiency tax without authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">Respondent contends that, even if his classification was improper, his determination should nonetheless stand because the amount of tax imposed is less than what would have been imposed had United States Steel been classified as a general business. This premise, viz., that the general business tax would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>have been greater, is disputed by Steel. In any event we may not here decide the amount of the general business tax, if any, which respondent might have imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">The order appealed from should be reversed and the determination of the Comptroller annulled, with costs in this court and in the Appellate Division, and the matter remitted to the Comptroller for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b505-5\">Desmond, Ch. J.</author>\n<p id=\"Anse\">(dissenting). The question is not whether the Comptroller erred in calling appellant a <em>1 </em>\u2018 financial business \u201d for taxing purposes. The sole question for decision is whether appellant owes, to New York City, \u201c General Business and Financial Taxes \u201d in at least the amount assessed against it by the Comptroller <em>(Lewis </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>284 U. S. 281, 283). The character and extent of appellant\u2019s New York City activities are fully described in the record before us. That record makes it completely clear that the taxes as assessed are valid and owed.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">The \u201c General Business and Financial Tax\u201d authorized by the State (General City Law, \u00a7 24-a) and imposed by the city (Administrative Code of City of New York, ch. 46) is one tax, not two. The only difference between the taxation of \u201cfinancial \u2019 \u2019 businesses and the taxation of other covered activities is that the city may levy against the former a tax up to two-fifths of 1% of gross income while the tax against the latter may not exceed one fifth of 1% of gross receipts. In other words, there are two separate maxima as to two kinds of businesses, not two kinds of tax. If the Comptroller, describing appellant as a financial business, had sent it tax bills computed at the rate of two fifths of 1% on its whole receipts, he would have acted illegally since the State law did not permit inclusion of holding companies like appellant in the list of \u201c financial businesses \u201d. But the Comptroller was, by State enabling law and city local law, empowered to tax any locally conducted business, whether \u201cfinancial\u201d or other kind, up to one fifth of 1% on its gross takings. The taxes here contested by appellant were figured at a rate much lower than that \u2014 two fifths of 1% of 12%%, that is, one twentieth of 1% on appellant\u2019s gross receipts. Since that was well below the authorized tax on \u201c general busi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>nesses \u201d and since appellant, if not a \u201cfinancial business \u201d, is certainly a taxable New York City business of some kind <em>(Matter of Steinbeck </em>v. <em>Gerosa, </em>4 N Y 2d 302, 308, 309), the tax levied was valid and there is nothing to litigate (see <em>Matter of Nash </em>v. <em>Lynch, </em>226 App. Div. 421, 423, affd. 253 N. Y. 564; <em>Matter of National Gash Register Co. </em>v. <em>Joseph, </em>299 N. Y. 200, 203). There is in this record an express stipulation that, if the Comptroller had elected to treat this as a general business, the tax could on the undisputed facts have been four times as high as the actual levy here being litigated.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">Appellant\u2019s transactions were all carried on in New York City so there is no problem of allocation as between intrastate and interstate commerce. The Comptroller\u2019s power to use, as to local New York City businesses, allocation formulae producing less than the maximum allowable tax has been upheld by this court <em>(Olive Coat Co. </em>v. <em>City of New York, </em>283 N. Y. 733; <em>Berkshire Fine Spinning Associates </em>v. <em>City of New York, </em>5 N Y 2d 347, 358, 359, appeal dismissed 361 U. S. 3; see <em>Matter of New Yorker Mag. </em>v. <em>Gerosa, </em>3 N Y 2d 362, 369, appeal dismissed 356 U. S. 339).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">We have often reminded ourselves that it is our duty \u201cto ascertain and declare the whole law upon the undisputed facts \u201d spread before us <em>(Oneida Bank </em>v. <em>Ontario Bank, </em>21 N. Y. 490, 504; <em>Rentways </em>v. <em>O\u2019Neill Milk &amp; Cream Co., </em>308 N.
