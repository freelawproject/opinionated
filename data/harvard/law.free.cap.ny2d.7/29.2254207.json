Y. 803.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b75-8\">Fuld, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AFu\">The relator, now over 65 years old, was found guilty in 1924 of robbery, committed in 1920, and was sentenced to imprisonment for a definite term of 40 years as a second felony offender. In the ordinary course, his term would have expired on January 26, 1964. On July 1, 1940, after more than 16 years of continuous imprisonment, apparently without a single prison rule infraction, the authorities at Sing Sing Prison determined that the relator was entitled to \u2018 \u2018 commutation \u2019 \u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>of 17 years, 11 months and 9 days for good behavior and \u201c compensation \u201d of 5 years, 6 months and 10 days for labor performed and that, by virtue of time already served and such earned reduction, he had fully served his term and recommended to the Governor that the sentence be reduced accordingly. Several weeks later, the Governor, following the recommendation, allowed the commutation and reduced the sentence. The release was conditioned upon the relator\u2019s being \u201c subject to the jurisdiction and control \u2019 \u2019 of the Parole Board, the relator agreeing to such condition in an instrument signed on July 26, and, on August 7, 1940, he was released from prison on parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">The relator remained at liberty for more than 17 years and, so far as appears, never had any brushes with the law. However, on September 16, 1957, he was taken into custody for violation of parole and a month later returned to Sing Sing. The Parole Board declared him delinquent as of the latter date and, after a hearing of charges, decided to hold the relator for a period of two years \u2014 until September, 1959 \u2014 for \u201c reconsideration only \u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">In May of 1958, the relator instituted this habeas corpus proceeding. It was his claim that, if he were credited with the \u201ccompensation\u201d \u2014 of 5 years, 6 months and 10 days \u2014 for labor performed in prison prior to, his release in August, 1940, and with the \u2018 \u2018 compensation \u2019 \u2019 earned since his reimprisonment in September, 1957, he had fully completed his 40-year term and was entitled to his release by habeas corpus. The court at Special Term agreed with the position taken by the relator and directed his' discharge. The Appellate Division affirmed, although not unanimously, and the People appeal to us as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">Ooncededly, if the relator is entitled to be credited with compensation for labor performed, he is entitled to his release. Thus, we must decide whether he became entitled to such compensation <em>as of right </em>when it was allowed to him in August of 1940 upon his release from prison on parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">Prisoners had long been allowed a <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u2018 commutation \u2019 \u2019 of sentence for good behavior, its grant or allowance resting in discretion and being a matter of grace. \u201cCompensation\u201d for labor performed while in prison, however, was quite different, both, in origin, purpose and method of. computation. Th.e con.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>cept came into our law in the year 1916 (L. 1916, ch. 358). It was only reasonable that the convicts who perform labor while in prison receive a consideration for such labor. This consideration could have taken the form of cash, but it was soon discovered \u2014 to cull from a brief submitted by the AttorneyGieneral in a case before the courts shortly after the 1916 amendment <em>(People ex rel. Roache </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>181 App. Div. 833) \u2014 that \u201cthe method of money payment did not procure the diligence looked for in convict industries or supply the normal output expected \u2019 \u2019 and, accordingly, the Legislature provided for this so-called \u201c compensation</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">At any rate, subdivision 3 of section 230 of the Prison Law, by virtue of the 1916 enactment, prescribed that a definite sentence convict might earn a reduction of his term by \u201c compensation for efficient and willing performance of duties assigned to him \u201d of 10 days in each 30 days in which such duties are performed; provision was also made for an allowance of \u201c commutation \u201d for \u201cgood conduct\u201d, progressively, up to seven months a year. The statute further provided that the Prison Board in each prison was to have the power to recommend that compensation be withheld as a punishment for offenses against the discipline of the prison. Significantly, though, it was explicitly stated that \u2018 \u2018 Compensation credited to a convict in the first instance, in his account, by the agent and warden, as provided in section two hundred and thirty, <em>shall stand as the compensation allowed, </em>unless withheld wholly or partly by the board as punishment, as above provided.\u201d There was no corresponding-provision as to commutation. From these provisions and from the others in force from 1916 to 1926,. it seems clear that \u201c compensation \u201d once earned and credited in the convict\u2019s \u201c account \u201d was irrevocable and automatically reduced the convict\u2019s sentence \u2014 except in cases (1) where he violated prison rules (Prison Law, \u00a7 236), (2) where he escaped from prison (\u00a7 238), and (3) where he was convicted of a felony later committed (\u00a7 243).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">Quite obviously, a distinction existed, under the 1916 statute \u2014 the one in force when the relator was sentenced \u2014 between commutation and compensation. In the <em>Roache </em>case (181 App. Div. 833, <em>supra), </em>decided in 1918, the court recognized that the convict was to be unconditionally discharged on the date when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>the time actually served plus \u201c the compensatory days \u201d equaled the term imposed (p. 835): \u201cWhere, then,\u201d asked the court, \u201cis the question? Is it not plain that, if the convict is allowed ten days in every thirty, the time will come when his days actually served, with the compensatory days, will equal the limit of his service? \u201d Under the statute as it read both in 1920, when the relator committed the crime of which he was later convicted, and in 1924, when he was sentenced, section 236 of the Prison Law provided that, while the Prison Board could withhold the compensation as punishment for dereliction of prison discipline, such compensation once credited amounted to a reduction of the sentence. It had the same effect as if the sentence had been pronounced for a lesser term, being the difference between the sentence pronounced and the amount credited as compensation. The State, through the Legislature, in effect, made a bargain with the prisoner that, if he would efficiently and willingly perform the duties assigned to him, his sentence would be reduced every 30 days and that, when he had served the amount of the reduced sentence, he would be entitled to his discharge. This was in the nature of a contract. Commutation, on the other hand, was simply a favor promised the prisoner which could be taken away in the event of misconduct. (See, e.g., <em>People ex rel. Fershing </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>174 Misc. 191, revd. on other grounds 259 App. Div. 957; see, also, <em>People ex rel. Jackson </em>v. <em>Morhous, </em>286 App. Div. 939.)</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">The distinction between \u201ccompensation\u201d and \u201ccommutation \u2019 \u2019 continued, as noted above, at least until 1926. In that year, section 230 of the Prison Law was amended (L. 1926, ch. 736) and a distinction made between convicts whose crimes were committed <em>before July 1, 1926, </em>as to whom compensation as a right was preserved, and convicts whose crimes were committed <em>after </em>that date, as to whom there was to be no such compensation. (Cf. <em>Matter of O\u2019Neil </em>v. <em>Thayer, </em>154 Misc. 333, 337, affd. 245 App. Div. 349, affid. 270 N. Y. 521.) And in the later amendatory statutes, the Legislature made it clear, by express provisions (L. 1929, ch. 243, amdg. Prison Law, \u00a7 237; L. 1935, ch. 902, \u00a7 16; L. 1948, ch. 631), that the rights thus preserved to pre-1926 prisoners were not to be affected retroactively.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>We are here concerned solely with a credit attributable to compensation for labor performed by a prisoner convicted of a crime committed before July 1, 1926.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> That being so, section 230 of the old Prison Law applied and the rights thereunder acquired were not lost by the enactment of subsequent legislation or by the terms of the release agreement signed by him in July of 1940. In other words, the compensation of 5 years, 6 months and 10 days earned by, and credited to, the relator prior to his release on parole effected a reduction of his 40-year term to that extent. Since he did not violate any prison rules (Prison Law, \u00a7 236), did not escape from prison (\u00a7 238) and was not convicted of a felony subsequently committed (\u00a7 243), the compensation which he had earned may not be taken from him and, consequently, it follows that, as of July 7, 1958, when the writ of habeas corpus was sustained, he more than completed service of the 40-year term for which he had been imprisoned.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">No decision of this court militates against our conclusion. In neither <em>Vanilla </em>v. <em>Moran </em>(298 N. Y. 796) nor <em>People ex rel. Scarola </em>v. <em>Murphy </em>(5 N Y 2d 979) was the question now before us considered. The first, wherein the present relator in 1946 brought an action for a declaratory judgment, decided only that Vanilla remained subject to the jurisdiction of the Parole Board following his release from Sing Sing Prison in 1940 and the <em>Scarola </em>case not only involved a crime committed after July 1, 1926, but had nothing to do with an attempt on the part of the authorities to take from a prisoner the credit for compensation already earned and credited.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">The order appealed from should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">Chief Judge Conway and Judges Desmond, Dye, Froessel, Van Voorhis and Burke concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-8\">Order affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b79-9\">. Since our decision is thus limited, it is hardly necessary to add that we are not to be taken as passing upon the rights of prisoners who committed crimes after July 1, 1926.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
