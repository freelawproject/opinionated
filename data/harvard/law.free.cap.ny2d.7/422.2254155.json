If such coverage was afforded, then appellant, under the terms of its policy, is obligated to defend a wrongful death action instituted against the city and Wells by Robinson\u2019s administratrix. The case was tried by the court without a jury upon the following stipulated facts:</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">On May 13, 1957 an Albany police prowl car driven by Wells in the performance of his duties collided with another vehicle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>at the intersection of Madison and Lake Avenues in the City of Albany. Robinson was a passenger in the police car, in the performance of his duties as a police officer, and was killed as a result of the collision. The decedent\u2019s administratrix commenced a wrongful death action against the City of Albany and Wells and, after appellant disclaimed coverage under the policy and refused to defend the action, the city and Wells brought this declaratory judgment action.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">At the time of the accident, and for an annual premium of $95.85, the police car was insured by an automobile liability policy issued by appellant to the \u201c City op Albany, Dept, op Police \u201d as the named insured. In the section entitled \u201c Exclusions \u2019 \u2019 the policy provided, insofar as pertinent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-6\">\u2018 \u2018 This policy does not apply: * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-7\">\u201c (d) under coverage A, <em>to bodily injury to </em>or sickness, disease <em>or death of any employee of the insured arising out of and in the course of </em>(1) domestic employment by the insured, if benefits therefor are in whole or in part either payable or required to be provided under any workmen\u2019s compensation law, or (2) <em>other employment by the insured-,</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-8\">\u201c(e) under coverage A, to any obligation for which the insured or any carrier as his insurer may be held liable under any workmen\u2019s compensation, unemployment compensation or disability benefits law, or under any similar law\u201d (emphasis supplied). \u2022</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-9\">Neither Wells nor Robinson was \u201c engaged in domestic employment within the meaning and intent of the policy at the time of said accident\u201d, nor were they covered by workmen\u2019s compensation, social security, or the Employers\u2019 Disability Benefits Law. The City of Albany is not required to carry workmen\u2019s compensation on its police officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-10\">Section III of the policy, entitled \u201cDefinition of Insured \u201d, contained the usual omnibus clause in subdivision (a) insuring, in addition to the named insured, any person operating the vehicle with the permission of the named insured, and further provided: <em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>The insurance with respect to any person or organization <em>other than the named insured </em>* * * <em>does not </em>apply: (1) * * *; (2) <em>to any employee with respect to </em>injury to or sickness, disease <em>or death of another employee of the same employer injured m the course of such employment in an acci</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number><em>dent arising out of the </em>maintenance or <em>use of the automobile in the business of such employer.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.) Wells was using the involved vehicle with the permission of the named insured at the time of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">It may he noted at the outset that the question of the liability of the City of Albany and Wells to the administratrix of the Robinson estate is not before us now. We are concerned solely with the liability of the insurer under the policy, as written. Special Term simply held that neither the \u201c exclusion \u201d nor the \u201c definition \u201d provision of the policy was applicable, since \u2018 <em>\u2018 </em>policemen are not employees of the city but are governmental agents of the State \u201d. The Appellate Division agreed that the issue of coverage was controlled by the <em>common-law </em>rule that \u201c a policeman is not considered a municipal agent or servant but a public officer performing a governmental function. <em>(Matter of Evans </em>v. <em>Berry, </em>262 N. Y. 61, 68; <em>Matter of Ryan </em>v. <em>City of New York, </em>228 N. Y. 16, 19.) \u201d In that connection, the court reasoned that section 50-a of the G-eneral Municipal Law \u2014 which provides, in pertinent part, that a person <em>\u201c </em>appointed \u201d by a municipality to operate a municipally owned vehicle <em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>shall, for the purpose of this section, be deemed an employee of the municipality, notwithstanding the vehicle was being operated in the discharge of a public duty for the benefit of all citizens of the community and the municipality derived no special benefit in its corporate capacity \u201d<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> \u2014 did not create \u201c an employee status on the part of the decedent\u201d for the purpose of the employee exclusionary provision of the policy, since 6 <em>\u2018 </em>Decedent was not the driver and it is only the driver \u2014 the person \u2018 appointed \u2019 to operate the vehicle \u2014 who shall be 6 an employee \u2019.\u201d The statutory purpose of imposing liability on the municipality for the negligent\" operation of municipal vehicles was <em>\u2018\u2018 </em>completely accomplished\u201d by \u201c denominating the operator an employee 1 for the purpose of [the] section \u2019 \u201d, and hence the court saw <em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>no ground for extending the application of the statute to any other person \u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">The Appellate Division further held that Wells qualified as an additional insured \u2018 <em>\u2018 </em>within the definition of the policy \u2019 \u2019, since <em>11 </em>Decedent, retaining his common-law status as a public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>officer, was not Wells\u2019 fellow servant and never became \u2018 another employee \u2019 of the city\u201d (Policy, \u00a7 III, subd. [a], par. [2]). Although the court recognized that \u201c The concept of statuses differing as between the two police officers and variable as to one of them is doubtless an artificial one \u201d, it felt that such a result was \u2018 \u2018 clearly mandated by the unambiguous language employed by the Legislature to effect a particular and unmistakable intent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">We cannot agree that the nonemployee status of Police Officer Robinson is \u20181 clearly mandated by the unambiguous language \u2019 \u2019 of section 50-a. That section was derived from former section 282-g of the Highway Law (enacted by L. 1929, ch. 466), whose purpose was <em>\u201c </em>to make municipalities liable for the negligence of the operators of their vehicles in the exercise of their statutory duties, in the course of their employment and in the discharge of their governmental functions. <em>(Miller </em>v. <em>City of New York, </em>235 App. Div. 259.) The Legislature provided that such an operator should, for the purposes of the act, \u2018 be deemed to be an employee of the municipality, <em>notwithstanding the vehicle was being operated in the discharge of a public duty.\u2019 </em>\u201d <em>(Matter of Evans </em>v. <em>Berry, </em>262 N. Y. 61, 68; emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">But this court further noted in the <em>Evatls </em>case (262 N. Y., pp. 70-71), in holding that the City of New York could constitutionally assume a liability for injuries caused by a police officer while engaged in his governmental duty of making an arrest: \u201c As was noted in <em>Augustine </em>v. <em>Town of Brant </em>[249 N. Y. 198, 205], the modern tendency is against the rule of non-liability of municipalities for the acts of firemen and policemen <em>employed by them. </em>The <em>fiction </em>that they are not acting in the course of their duties <em>as city employees </em>is no longer regarded as a part of the fundamental law. The tendency to apply the rule of <em>respondeat superior </em>ha,s been noted with approval in [citing numerous articles].\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) In expressly abrogating the rule of nonliability with respect to the negligent operation of municipal vehicles, and making it crystal clear that those appointed to drive the vehicles were to be deemed employees of the municipality <em>even when </em>performing a governmental function, the Legislature certainly did not intend to provide that, for all other purposes, city nolicemen, etc., were not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>to be deemed employees of the municipality. If anything, it recognized the <em>\u201c </em>modern tendency \u201d referred to above.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\">In the same year in which section 282-g of the Highway Law was enacted, the Legislature fully waived the State\u2019s immunity \u2018 \u2018 from liability for the torts of its officers and employees \u2019 \u2019 by enacting section 12-a (now \u00a7 8) of the Court of Claims Act (L. 1929, ch. 467), which presently makes the State, as well as its municipal subdivisions, liable in the same manner as individuals and corporations <em>(Jackson </em>v. <em>State of New York, </em>261 N. Y. 134; <em>Bernardine </em>v. <em>City of New York, </em>294 N. Y. 361, 365-366). As we noted in <em>Becker </em>v. <em>City of Neto York </em>(2 N Y 2d 226, 235), the <em>Bernardine </em>case \u201c expressly held \u201d that section 8 was \u2018 \u2018 equally applicable to the subdivisions of the State, such as the City of New York, as to the State itself, despite the existence of specific provisions for liability in the General Municipal Law5 \u2019. While section 50-d of the General Municipal Law expressly made a municipality liable only for the negligence of <em>physicians and dentists </em>in public institutions \u2014 who are deemed to be employees of the municipality <em>\u20181 </em>for the purpose of this section \u201d (50-d) \u2014 we held in the <em>Becker </em>case <em>\u201c </em>that the effect of section 8 of the Court of Claims Act is to make the State and its subdivisions liable, under the doctrine of <em>respondeat superior, </em>for the negligent acts of its <em>paid employees, </em>including <em>nurses </em>employed by it in its hospitals * * *. <em>Under this enactment, all persons who are employees of the State are treated as such, </em>and the doctrine of <em>respondeat superior </em>is applied to determine whether the State is liable.\u201d (2 N Y 2d, pp. 235-236; emphasis supplied.) In rejecting the rule that treated <em>\u201c </em>persons, <em>who by all other tests are clearly employees, </em>as independent contractors when they arc engaged in the performance of a medical act \u201d, wo noted that \u201c In enacting the Court of Claims Act, the Legislature did not intend to apply such rule to the State and its subdivisions \u201d (2 N Y 2d, p. 235; emphasis supplied; see, also, <em>McCrink </em>v. <em>City of New York, </em>296 N. Y. 99, 105-106; <em>Schuster </em>v. <em>City of New York, </em>5 N Y 2d 75, 81-83).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">Thus, even if section 50-a of the General Municipal Law could be read as preserving the <em>11 </em>public officer \u201d status of those city policemen who are <em>not1 </em>\u2018 appointed \u2019 \u2019 to operate municipal vehicles, section 8 of the Court of Claims Act \u2014 the controlling legislative enactment \u2014 requires us to treat <em>all </em>city policemen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>as employees of the municipality, since \u201cby all other tests [they] are clearly employees As Judge Lotjghean observed in the <em>Bernardine </em>case (294 N. Y., p. 366, <em>supra), \u201c </em>the argumentation that had been contrived as a front for the doctrine of governmental immunity [that officers and employees when engaged in the discharge of so-called governmental functions acted as delegates of the State and not in behalf of any municipal master] <em>did not survive the renouncement of that doctrine.'1 </em>\u2019 (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">In any event, section 50-a does not purport to affect or have any bearing on the definition of the word \u2018 \u2018 employee \u2019 \u2019 as used in an insurance policy. We are concerned, in the instant case, not with the liability of a <em>municipality </em>under a <em>statute </em>(cf. <em>Miller </em>v. <em>City of Albany, </em>158 Misc. 720, affd. 247 App. Div. 848), but with the liability of an <em>insurer </em>under a <em>contract of insurance. </em>The issue is the intent of the contracting parties, not the intent of the Legislature\u2014 (cf. <em>Matter of Ryan </em>v. <em>City of New York, </em>228 N. Y. 16, holding that members of the New York City Police Department were not covered by the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law since compensation was assured them by an independent statute) \u2014and in deciding what the parties meant by the word \u201c employee \u201d, \u201c \u2018 Our guide must be the reasonable expectation and purpose of the ordinary business man when making an insurance contract * * * \u2019 <em>(Burr </em>v. <em>Commercial Travelers Mut. Accident Assn., </em>295 N. Y. 294, 301). \u2018 <em>The language employed in the contract of insurance must be given its ordinary meaning, </em>such as the average policyholder of ordinary intelligence, as well as the insurer, would attach to it.\u2019 <em>(Abrams </em>v. <em>Great Amer. Ins. Co., </em>269 N. Y. 90, 92.) \u201d <em>(Morgan </em>v. <em>Greater N. Y. Taxpayers Mut. Ins. Assn., </em>305 N. Y. 243, 248; emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">Since the policy in question was specifically issued to cover the prowl car involved and used by the Albany Police Department, the parties surely must have considered members of the Albany police force to be employees of the city. If the language used in an insurance contract\u00a3 \u00a3 must be given its ordinary meaning \u201d, then it would be most unreal to hold that members of the Albany police force were not considered employees of the City of Albany, by which they are hired, paid, disciplined, and discharged. It is not necessary to extend the application of any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>statute to hold that both Wells and Robinson were employees of the city for purposes of the insurance contract. All we need do is to give the word \u201c employees \u201d its <em>11 </em>ordinary meaning \u201d, and not assume that the parties intended to import an outmoded <em>\u20181 </em>fiction \u2019 \u2019 into their contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\">With reference to the risks excluded by the policy, the city contends that, even if decedent may be deemed its employee within the meaning of the policy, coverage is nonetheless afforded for any liability it incurred as a result of his death, since the purpose of the exclusionary provisions was \u201c to exclude coverage only for liability to employees of an employer who carries, or is required to carry, Workmen\u2019s Compensation Insurance. \u2019 \u2019 Such a holding would completely disregard the provision excluding coverage for the \u2018\u2018 death of any employee of the insured arising out of and in the course of * * * other [than domestic] employment by the insured \u201d, and include within the coverage of the policy a risk which the insurer manifestly considered too great to cover for the small premium involved. While it is well settled that <em>ambiguities </em>in an insurance policy are to be resolved against the insurer, since it wrote the policy, we find no ambiguity here.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">The pertinent provisions of the policy exclude three separate and distinct risks from coverage: (1) any obligation for which the insured or its carrier may be held liable under any Workmen\u2019s Compensation or similar law (subd. [e]), (2) \u201c death of any employee of the insured arising out of and in the course of <em>* </em>* * domestic employment \u201d, if and <em>only if </em>workmen\u2019s compensation benefits were payable or were required to be provided (subd. [d], par. [1]), and (3) \u201c death of any employee of the insured arising out of and in the course of * * * other employment by the insured \u2019 \u2019, i.e., employment other than domestic employment, <em>without qualification </em>(subd. [d], par. [2]). The distinction between domestic and other employment, with respect to the availability of workmen\u2019s compensation, is clearly drawn, and the language plainly excluded from coverage the death of an insured\u2019s employee <em>\u201c </em>arising out of and in the course of * * * other employment \u2019 \u2019, notwithstanding the fact that the death may not have been compensable. It was so squarely held in <em>Jewtraw </em>v. <em>Hartford Acc. &amp; Ind. Co. </em>(280 App. Div. 150,153), where Presiding Justice Foster wrote: <em>\u201c \u2018 </em>Cover<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>age A \u2019 refers to bodily injuries and is common to both clauses (d) and (e). Reading the two clauses together it is quite clear (d), so far as claims for personal injuries are concerned, excludes all employees, other than domestics not covered by workmen\u2019s compensation, irrespective of compensation benefits. If this is not so then clause (e) is superfluous. In our opinion the language of (d) if read alone is clear enough, but certainly when the two clauses are read together no ambiguity appears in either.\u201d (See, also, <em>Jewtraw </em>v. <em>Hartford Acc. &amp; Ind. Co., </em>286 App. Div. 931, affd. 2 N Y 2d 788.)</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">While some language of the Appellate Division, First Department, in <em>Greaves </em>v. <em>Public Serv. Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(4 A D 2d 609, 612) appears to take a different view, that language was not necessary to the decision, and was not adopted or indorsed by our court\u2019s affirming opinion (at 5 N Y 2d 120). In that case, the party injured was concededly <em>not </em>an employee of Greaves, who qualified as an additional insured within the definition of the policy. We held (p. 125) the exclusionary clause had \u201cno effect as to him [Greaves] since the injured man was not an \u2018 employee of the insured \u2019 Greaves <em>and </em>the \u2018 insured \u2019 Greaves was not liable to the injured man \u2018 under any workmen\u2019s compensation law \u2019 \u201d (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">Inasmuch as the injured party in that case was not an employee of the additional insured, it was not necessary to \u2014 and this court did not \u2014 approve the reasoning of the Appellate Division that \u201cthe basic and underlying purpose apparently was to exclude coverage only as to an insured who either carried, or was required to carry, workmen\u2019s compensation insurance for the protection of an injured employee \u201d (4 A D 2d, p. 612). In defining the excluded risks, the Appellate Division\u2019s <em>dictum </em>erroneously ignored the distinction between domestic and other employment with respect to the availability of workmen\u2019s compensation benefits, perhaps because the two risks were not as clearly separated in the policy as here.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">The policy now before us, as opposed to that in the <em>Greaves </em>case, makes the distinction crystal clear. The exclusionary clause in <em>Greaves </em>included domestic employment and other employment in a single subdivision, immediately after which appeared the provision as to obligations incurred under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law. Here, on the other hand, domestic employment, <em>with the condition </em>as to workmen\u2019s compensation, is denominated paragraph (1) of subdivision (d); other employment, <em>without such condition, </em>is <em>separately </em>denominated paragraph (2) of subdivision (d); and obligations incurred under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law are treated separately in subdivision (e). Since decedent here <em>was </em>an employee of the <em>named insured </em>\u2014 the City of Albany \u2014 and since his death arose out of and in the course of employment other than domestic employment, the policy as written did not afford coverage to the city for any liability incurred by it as a result of its employee\u2019s death. The language of the exclusionary clause unequivocally excluded this risk from coverage (subd. [d], par. [2]).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\">As to the driver of the vehicle, Police Officer Wells, respondent contends \u201c that even if Wells and Robinson are held to be employees of the City of Albany, and even if they are held to be the type employees as intended by exclusion (d), coverage is still afforded by the policy to Wells as an additional assured.\u201d If Wells qualified as an additional insured within the definition of the policy, he would be entitled to coverage under the \u201cseparability\u201d doctrine established by this court in <em>Morgan </em>v. <em>Greater N. Y. Taxpayers Mut. Ins. Assn. </em>(305 N. Y. 243, supra) and <em>Greaves </em>v. <em>Public Serv. Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(5 N Y 2d 120, <em>supra) </em>since decedent was not his employee under exclusion (d). In the two cited cases, this court (5 N Y 2d, p. 125) rejected the argument that an additional insured could not have more protection under a liability policy than the named insured, and established the proposition \u201c that an additional although unnamed insured * * * had to be treated as if he had a separate policy\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">Under the omnibus clause provision in the \u2018 \u2018 Definition of Insured\u201d (\u00a7 III, subd [a]), Wells would qualify as an additional insured, since he was using the car with the permission of the named insured at the time of the accident. However, as respondents themselves concede, paragraph (2) of this same \u201c Definition of Insured \u201d section also expressly excluded \u201c from coverage as an additional insured \u201d \u201c <em>any employee with respect to injury to * * * or death of another employee of the same employer </em>injured in the course of such employment in an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>accident arising out of the # * * use of the automobile in the business of such employer.\u201d Since both decedent and Wells were employees of the same employer, and inasmuch as decedent sustained fatal injuries in the course of that employment \u201cin an accident arising out of the * # * use of the automobile in the business of such employer \u201d, Wells is expressly excluded from coverage as an additional insured with respect to the accident in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">The city\u2019s further contention that it is not engaged in a \u201c business \u201d is as unreal as its argument that decedent and Wells are not its employees. As previously noted, the language employed in an insurance contract \u201c must be given its ordinary meaning \u2019 \u2019, and, since it is stipulated that both decedent and Wells were engaged in the performance of their duties as police officers at the time of the accident, it necessarily follows that the accident arose \u201c out of the * * * use of the automobile in the business of such employer \u2019 \u2019.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-10\">It should be noted, in conclusion, that this case comes to us on bare stipulated facts, and the only issue presented to and decided by the lower courts was whether the terms of the policy, as written, afforded coverage to the City of Albany and Wells. Both parties rely on the policy provisions, and do not question their validity. The \u2018 \u2018 employee \u2019 \u2019 exclusion provision of the policy has been approved in the exact language and form used here by the State Department of Insurance (Ins. Beg. 35, subd. <em>2; </em>N. Y. Off. Comp, of Codes, Rules &amp; Regulations, 12th Off. Supp., 1959, Jan. 1, 1956, to Dec. 31, 1956, p. 698).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-11\">Accordingly, under the provisions of the policy as-written, no coverage is afforded to the plaintiffs herein by reason of the death of Robinson, and hence appellant is not required to defend the action brought by Robinson\u2019s administratrix.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-12\">The judgment appealed from should be reversed, with costs, and the matter remitted to Special Term for the entry of judgment in favor of appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-13\">Chief Judge Desmond and Judges Dye, Fuld, Van Voorhis and Burke concur; Judge Foster taking no part.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-14\">Judgment reversed, with costs in all courts, and matter remitted to Special Term for further proceedings in accordance with the opinion herein.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b471-6\"> For similar provisions, see sections 50-b and 50-d of the General Municipal Lew*</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
