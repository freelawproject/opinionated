Petitioner\u2019s claim that he was convicted of speeding only is without substance. In any event, his dispute, if any, in this respect does not lie in this proceeding against the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles. <em>(Matter of Christoff </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>8 A D 2d 687; <em>Matter of Banks </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>6 A D 2d 512; <em>Matter of La Victoire </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>5 A D 2d 548; <em>Matter of Gross </em>v. <em>Macduff, </em>284 App. Div. 786.) II. There was substantial evidence before the Commissioner that-petitioner was convicted of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor. <em>(Matter of Moore </em>v. <em>Macduff, </em>309 N. Y. 35; <em>Matter of Bouchard </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>7 A D 2d 774, 6 N Y 2d 705; <em>Matter of Coleman </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>12 Misc 2d 116.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b508-6\"><em>Philip D.

S. 197; <em>Matter of Stork Restaurant </em>v. <em>Boland, </em>282 N. Y. 256; <em>Matter of Phinn </em>v. <em>Kross, </em>8 A D 2d 132; <em>Matter of Moore </em>v. <em>Macduff, </em>309 N.

[b]), requires the revocation of an operator\u2019s license for the conviction outside the State of \u201c an offense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>consisting of operating a motor vehicle or motor cycle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor \u2019 \u2019. In the case before us, there can be no possible doubt that the petitioner was convicted in Massachusetts of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor in violation of section 24 of chapter 90 of the General Laws of Massachusetts. In the light of all the documents before respondent Motor Vehicle Commissioner and of the Massachusetts statute itself, of which judicial notice could be taken, it is of no significance that the Massachusetts \u201c Abstract of Court Record of Violation of Motor Vehicle Laws \u201d simply recited in abbreviated form that the petitioner had been convicted of \u201c Operating under the influence \u201d. The Commissioner was required, therefore, to revoke the petitioner\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\">The present case differs significantly from <em>Matter of Moore </em>v. <em>Macduff </em>(309 N. Y. 35) in that, in the latter, there was doubt, because of alternative grounds provided in the Canadian statute, whether the petitioner had been convicted of driving while his ability to do so had been impaired by \u201c alcohol \u201d or by a \u201c drug \u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">The orders should be reversed and the petition dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">Chief Judge Desmond and Judges Dye, Fuld, Froessel, Van Voorhis, Burke and Foster concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">Order reversed and determination of the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles reinstated, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
