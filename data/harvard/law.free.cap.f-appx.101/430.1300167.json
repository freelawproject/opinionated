City of Arlington, </em>957 F.2d 1268, 1273 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-17\">Summary judgment was proper in this case because the undisputed evidence shows that Brock did not sustain any injury resulting from the claimed constitutional violation. <em>See Memphis Community School Dist. v. Stachura, </em>477 U.S. 299, 308-09, 106 S.Ct. 2537, 91 L.Ed.2d 249 (1986). The summary-judgment evidence, including Brock\u2019s own pleadings and testimony at the <em>Spears </em>hearing, show that his loss of vision was not caused by any head trauma and that he never required any medical attention when he bumped his head on the upper bunk. Brock has thus failed to show any cognizable injury resulting from the alleged particular act of deliberate indifference, and his claim fails. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b465-18\">Brock argues that the district court erred in considering Dr. Richardson\u2019s affidavit for the proposition that his loss of vision did not result from head trauma because the affidavit was untimely and because Dr. Richardson was not qualified as an expert. As noted above, Brock\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>own evidence, specifically, the letter from Dr. Richardson which he attached to his complaint, contained the same information as Dr. Richardson\u2019s affidavit. The affidavit was thus duplicative of Brock\u2019s evidence and the district court\u2019s consideration of it, even if error, was harmless. Brock\u2019s conclusional allegation that head trauma could equally have caused his loss of vision does not meet his burden to show a genuine issue of material fact. <em>See Little v. Liquid Air Corp., </em>37 F.3d 1069, 1075 (5th Cir.1994) (en banc). His reliance on the affidavits he submitted from other inmates for the proposition that his blindness resulted from head injuries is misplaced because none of the inmate affidavits so state.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b465-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
