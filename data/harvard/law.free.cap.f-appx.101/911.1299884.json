Tancho challenges the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"912\">*912</page-number>IJ\u2019s finding that she failed to show by clear and convincing evidence that her asylum application was timely filed. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B) (2000); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.4(a) (2003). We conclude that we lack jurisdiction to review this claim pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3) (2000). We thus may not review her claim that she in fact qualified for asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-4\">We accordingly dismiss the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-5\">\n<em>PETITION DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
