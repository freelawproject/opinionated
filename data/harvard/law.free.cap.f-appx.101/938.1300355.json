Black contends that he is entitled to a reduction in sentence based upon Amendments 505 and 516 to the United States Sentencing Guidelines, which reduced the upper limit of the Drug Quantity Table and became effective November 1, 1995. This claim was raised and rejected in Black\u2019s earlier \u00a7 3582 motion. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-24\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b972-20\"> The district court construed Black\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c) motion as a motion filed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000), and dismissed it without prejudice on the ground that it was successive. To the extent that Black\u2019s motion could be construed as a \u00a7 2255 motion, relief would not be warranted because it would be successive.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
