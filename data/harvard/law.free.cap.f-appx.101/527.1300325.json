Brainerd (Brainerd) appeals the dismissal of his diversity action which was dismissed under the doctrine of <em>res judicata. </em>In his <em>pro se </em>brief, Brainerd does not brief the issue of whether his second action was barred by the doctrine of <em>res judicata. </em>Although <em>pro se </em>litigants are afforded liberal construction, even <em>pro se </em>litigants must brief arguments in order to preserve them. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-225 (5th Cir.1993). Thus, the issue is deemed abandoned. <em>Id. </em>at 225. Because Brainerd has failed to argue the only issue arguably on appeal, the appeal is frivolous and must be DISMISSED as such. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. Brainerd is WARNED that the filing of future frivolous appeals may result in sanctions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b561-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
