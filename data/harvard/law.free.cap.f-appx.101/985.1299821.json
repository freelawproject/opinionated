She argues, pursuant to <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (2) are elements of the offense, not sentence enhancements, making those pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"986\">*986</page-number>visions unconstitutional. She concedes that this argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), and she raises it for possible review by the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-4\">This argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>523 U.S. at 235. We must follow the precedent set forth in <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>\u201cunless and until the Supreme Court itself determines to overrule it.\u201d <em>United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000) (internal quotation and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-5\">Gonzalez does not brief any argument concerning how or why any potential reduction in her sentence for the 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326 conviction would have any bearing on the sentence the district court imposed upon revocation of her supervised release for her 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324(a)(1)(A)(iii) conviction. She has therefore abandoned her appeal from the revocation of her supervised release. <em>United States v. Valdiosera-Godinez, </em>932 F.2d 1093, 1099 (5th Cir. 1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1019-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under file limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
