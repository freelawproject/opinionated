In denying Leasure\u2019s motion to proceed IFP on appeal, the district court certified under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(3) and Fed. R.App. P. 24(a) that the appeal is not taken in good faith because it presents no legal points of arguable merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-25\">Leasure offers no arguments related to the merits of the district court\u2019s dismissal of his petition for a writ of error coram nobis for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Because Leasure has not demonstrated that he will present a nonfrivolous issue on appeal, his motion to proceed IFP is DENIED. <em>See Carson v. Polley, </em>689 F.2d 562, 586 (5th Cir.1982). Furthermore, his appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2; <em>see also Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 201-02 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-26\">We CAUTION Leasure that any additional frivolous appeals filed by him will invite the imposition of sanctions. To avoid sanctions, Leasure is further CAU<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>TIONED to review pending appeals to ensure that they do not raise arguments that are frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">IFP DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS; SANCTIONS WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b601-27\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
