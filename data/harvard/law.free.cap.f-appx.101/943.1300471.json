The district court dismissed Williams\u2019 petition in an order entered on November 12, 2003. Williams\u2019 notice of appeal, dated December 22, 2003, was received in the district court on December 29, 2003. In his notice of appeal, Williams stated that he \u201conly received [the district court\u2019s order] from Prison Staff on December 11.\u201d Williams\u2019 notice of appeal was made within the period of time applicable for a determination of excusable neglect or good cause under Rule 4(a)(5) of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure and expressed his desire to preserve his appeal. <em>See Myers v. Stephenson, </em>781 F.2d 1036, 1038-39 (4th Cir.1986). Accordingly, we remand this case to the district court for the limited purpose of permitting that court to determine whether Williams has shown excusable neglect or good cause warranting an extension of time for filing a notice of appeal. The record, as supplemented, then will be returned to this court for further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-8\">\n<em>REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
