California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Belle has filed a response stating his intention to proceed \u201cin proper person\u201d and seeking a 60-day extension of time to file a brief. Belle\u2019s request for an extension of time is DENIED. <em>See United States v. Wagner, </em>158 F.3d 901, 902-03 (5th Cir. 1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">Our independent review of the brief, the record, and Belle\u2019s response discloses no nonfrivolous issue for appeal. Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the appeal is DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b575-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
