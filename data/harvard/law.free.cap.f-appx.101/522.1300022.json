Self, however, did not file a timely notice of appeal from the judgment denying \u00a7 2255 relief, <em>see </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(B), and the district court did not err in its determination that Self was not entitled to extend the period for filing a timely notice of appeal under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5),(6). We are therefore without jurisdiction to entertain the appeal, and it is dismissed. <em>See Dison v.
