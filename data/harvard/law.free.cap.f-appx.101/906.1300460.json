Hooker was sentenced to ninety-two months\u2019 imprisonment, to be followed by a three-year term of supervised release. The sole issue on appeal is whether the district court clearly erred in applying the four-level enhancement under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b940-22\">Section 2K2.1(b)(5) provides for a defendant\u2019s offense level to be enhanced by four levels if he used or possessed a firearm \u201cin connection with another felony offense.\u201d The Government bears the burden of proving the necessary facts by a preponderance of the evidence and this court \u201creview[s] the district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error, giving due deference to the district court\u2019s application of the Guidelines to the facts.\u201d <em>United States v. Garnett, </em>243 F.3d 824, 828 (4th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b940-23\">In this Circuit, \u201cin connection with\u201d is treated as analogous to \u201cin relation to,\u201d as used in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) (2000). <em>United States v. Blount, </em>337 F.3d 404, 411 (4th Cir.2003). In other words, the firearm must facilitate or have the tendency to facilitate another offense. <em>Id. </em>at 411 (citing <em>Garnett, </em>243 F.3d at 829). \u201c\u2018[T]he firearm must have some purpose or effect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number>with respect to the ... crime; its presence or involvement cannot be the result of accident or coincidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Smith v. United States, </em>508 U.S. 223, 238, 113 S.Ct. 2050, 124 L.Ed.2d 138 (1993)) (modification in original). The government meets its burden if it shows that the gun was \u201cpresent for protection or to embolden the actor.\u201d <em>United States v. Lipford, </em>203 F.3d 259, 266 (4th Cir.2000) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b941-10\">The district court concluded that based on Hooker\u2019s possession of large amounts of cash, the presence of nearly a pound of marijuana in his residence and his criminal history involving marijuana, Hooker was distributing marijuana, a felony offense. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a), 841(b)(1)(D) (2000). The court found that Hooker\u2019s possession of a loaded gun and its proximity to the large amount of cash indicated that Hooker\u2019s use of the gun was in connection with the distribution of the marijuana. On these facts, we cannot say that the district court clearly erred in concluding that Hooker possessed the gun to facilitate the drug offense. Therefore, the court\u2019s decision to apply the enhancement was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-11\">We affirm Hooker\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
