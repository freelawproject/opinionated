This court reviews dismissals under \u00a7 1915A de novo. <em>Velasquez v. Woods, </em>329 F.3d 420, 421 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b991-19\">Nelson contends that the Texas Penal Code is void because the code has not been authenticated as required under the Texas Constitution and the trial court therefore lacked jurisdiction over his case. Nelson did not raise this argument in the district court. \u201cIt is a bedrock principle of appellate review that claims raised for the first time on appeal will not be considered.\u201d <em>Stewart Glass &amp; Mirror, Inc. v. U.S. Auto Glass Disc. Ctrs., Inc., </em>200 F.3d 307, 316-17 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b991-20\">Nelson asserts that the district court misinterpreted his amended complaint and that his conviction is invalid. In <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), the Supreme Court barred the recovery of damages under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 for an \u201callegedly unconstitutional conviction or imprisonment\u201d unless the conviction or sentence had \u201cbeen reversed on direct appeal, expunged by executive order, declared invalid by a state tribunal ..., or called into question by a federal court\u2019s issuance of a writ of habeas eorpus[.]\u201d A civil rights claim arising out of \u201ca conviction or sentence that has <em>not </em>been so invalidated is not cognizable under \u00a7 1983.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 487. Because the district court did not err in dismissing Nelson\u2019s complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b), this court need not determine whether the dismissal was also justified under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"AXe\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"958\">*958</page-number>Nelson\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, 707 </em>F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). Because the appeal is frivolous, it is DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th C\u00ede. R. 42.2. The dismissal of this appeal as frivolous counts as a \u201cstrike\u201d for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), as does the district court\u2019s dismissal. <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). We warn Nelson that if he accumulates three \u201cstrikes\u201d under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), he will not be able to proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b992-4\">APPEAL DISMISSED; STRIKE WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b991-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
