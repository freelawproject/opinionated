He appeals the 120-month term of imprisonment imposed, arguing that the district court clearly erred in adjusting his offense level for his leadership role in the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-9\">Pulido withdrew his objection to the adjustment for his leadership role in the offense at the sentencing hearing. Pulido has thus waived any challenge to the adjustment made based on his role in the offense, and his argument is not reviewable on appeal. <em>See United States v. Musquiz, </em>45 F.3d 927, 931 (5th Cir.1995); <em>United States v.
