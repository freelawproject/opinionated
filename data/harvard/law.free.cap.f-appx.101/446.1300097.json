On appeal, Lewis repeats his underlying constitutional claim. The district court correctly held that Lewis\u2019s claim is barred by <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), as well as under the doctrines of collateral estoppel and <em>res judicata. See Allen v. McCurry, </em>449 U.S. 90, 95-96, 104-05, 101 S.Ct. 411, 66 L.Ed.2d 308 (1980). Accordingly, Lewis\u2019s complaint was properly dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Ruiz v. United States, </em>160 F.3d 273, 275 (5th Cir.1998); <em>Martin v. Scott, </em>156 F.3d 578, 580 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-22\">Lewis\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). Because the appeal is frivolous, it is DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. The dismissal of this appeal as frivolous counts as a \u201cstrike\u201d for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), as does the district court\u2019s dismissal. <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 385-87 (5th Cir.1996). We warn Lewis that if he accumulates three \u201cstrikes\u201d under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), he will not be able to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-23\">APPEAL DISMISSED; STRIKE WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b480-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
