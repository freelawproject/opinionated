He argues that the district court erred in determining the loss attributable to him as a result of the conspiracy under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2F1.1. He argues that although he helped his coconspirators to repair their poor credit, he did not participate in or benefit from the purchases the coconspirators made with their new good credit. The losses sustained by the creditors who extended credit to Chance\u2019s coconspirators were reasonably foreseeable to Chance. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l) &amp; comment. (n.2). Because Chance did not present any rebuttal evidence at the sentencing hearing demonstrating the information in the Presentence Report (PSR) was untrue, the district court was entitled to adopt the information in the PSR without further inquiry. <em>See United States v. Parker, </em>133 F.3d 322, 329 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-19\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1004-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
