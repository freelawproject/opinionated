Delespine, Texas inmate # 187450, requests leave to proceed <em>informa pauperis </em>(IFP) on appeal. Delespine has not complied with 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915. He has not filed the prison trust fund account statement, as required for the district court to make a financial assessment for this appeal. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C.\u00a7 1915(a)(1), (2); <em>Hatchet v. Nettles, </em>201 F.3d 651, 652 (5th Cir.2000). Additionally, Delespine cannot show that he will present a nonfrivolous issue on appeal. <em>See Carson v. Polley, </em>689 F.2d 562, 586 (5th Cir.1982). Accordingly, Delespine\u2019s motion for IFP is DENIED, and the appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. 5th C\u00ede. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-22\">The dismissal of this appeal as frivolous counts as a strike for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). We warn Delespine that once he accumulates three strikes, he may not proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-23\">IF\u00cd DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS; STRIKE WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b537-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
