Neff appeals from the district court\u2019s order dismissing without prejudice his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (2000) action. The district court dismissed the complaint for failure to comply with its order to file a supplemental complaint to cure the defects in the original complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-28\">The district court\u2019s dismissal without prejudice is not appealable. <em>See Domino Sugar Corp. v. Sugar Workers Local Union 392, </em>10 F.3d 1064, 1066-67 (4th Cir.1993). A dismissal without prejudice is a final order only if no amendment could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"915\">*915</page-number>cure the defects in the complaint. <em>Id. </em>at 1067. In ascertaining whether a dismissal without prejudice is reviewable in this court, we must determine \u201cwhether the plaintiff could save his action by merely amending his complaint.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because Neff may cure the defect in his complaint by filing a supplemental complaint in accordance with the district court\u2019s order, the dismissal order is not appealable.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-5\">Accordingly, we deny Neffs motion for appointment of counsel and dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-6\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
