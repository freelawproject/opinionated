For the first time on appeal, Thomas contends that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) unconstitutionally extends federal control to firearm possession that does not substantially affect interstate commerce. He relies primarily on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Lopez, </em>514 U.S. 549, 115 S.Ct. 1624, 131 L.Ed.2d 626 (1995). Thomas acknowledges that this court has considered and rejected his argument in <em>United States v. De Leon, </em>170 F.3d 494, 498-99 (5th Cir.1999), and <em>United States v. Rawls, </em>85 F.3d 240, 242 (5th Cir.1996), but he is raising this argument to preserve it for Supreme Court review.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">In <em>Rawls, </em>this court held that the reasons the Supreme Court gave in <em>Lopez </em>for holding 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(q) unconstitutional do not apply to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g). <em>Rawls, </em>85 F.3d at 242. More recently, this court has emphasized that the constitutionality of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) is not open to question. <em>United States v. Daugherty, </em>264 F.3d 513, 517 (5th Cir.2001). Because Thomas\u2019 argument is foreclosed by this court\u2019s precedent, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b542-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
