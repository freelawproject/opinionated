California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Terry has filed a response, arguing that his trial attorney provided ineffective assistance and that the prosecutor engaged in misconduct by seeking to have Terry sentenced as a career offender without investigating Terry\u2019s criminal history. Terry also asserts that he did not receive the benefit of the representations made by the prosecutor to Terry\u2019s attorney in order to obtain Terry\u2019s guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-24\">Our independent review of the brief, Terry\u2019s response, and the record discloses no nonfrivolous issue for appeal. To the extent that Terry raises claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, the record is not adequately developed for us to consider this issue on appeal. <em>See United States v. Sanchez-Pena, </em>336 F.3d 431, 445-16 (5th Cir.2003). Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cm. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b510-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
