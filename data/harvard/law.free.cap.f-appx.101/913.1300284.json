Burke seeks review of the district court\u2019s order accepting the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation to affirm the administrative law judge\u2019s denial of disability benefits based on Burke\u2019s lack of sufficient quarters of coverage at the time of disability for DIB purposes. Our review of the record discloses that the Commissioner\u2019s decision is based upon substantial evidence and is without reversible error. In addition, we note that Burke\u2019s argument that he obtained sufficient quarters of coverage based on his military service was waived on appeal because he did not note specific objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s finding that his date last insured for DIB purposes was March 31, 1991. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 72(b); <em>Thomas v. Arn, </em>474 U.S. 140, 155, 106 S.Ct. 466, 88 L.Ed.2d 435 (1985). Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order. <em>See Burke v. Commissioner, Soc. Sec., </em>No. CA-02-319-2 (E.D.Va. Dec. 22, 2003). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-21\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
