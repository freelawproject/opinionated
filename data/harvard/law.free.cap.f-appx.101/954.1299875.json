McDonald argues that the district court clearly erred by assessing a two-level enhancement for possession of a dangerous weapon in connection with drug trafficking offenses pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b988-23\">Because McDonald did not specifically challenge the two-level enhancement below, we review only for plain error. <em>See United States v. Burton, </em>126 F.3d 666, 671 (5th Cir.1997). A two-level enhancement should be applied \u201c[i]f a dangerous weapon (including a firearm) was possessed\u201d during a drug trafficking offense. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l). The presentence report showed that a search of McDonald\u2019s In-galls Avenue apartment uncovered a firearm under McDonald\u2019s bed in close proximity to a small amount of marijuana. A search of McDonald\u2019s Jefferson Street res<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"955\">*955</page-number>idence uncovered three additional firearms. Testimony at McDonald\u2019s trial indicated that he left his Ingalls Avenue apartment carrying a paper bag containing three cookies of crack cocaine on the night he was arrested. McDonald did not challenge any of this evidence at sentencing. The district court did not plainly err by assessing the enhancement. <em>See United States v. Castillo, </em>77 F.3d 1480, 1498-99 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b989-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b988-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
