Jimenez-Mata argues that the district court erred in increasing his criminal history category with the same offense, <em>ie., </em>his conviction for importation of a quantity of marijuana, used to enhance his offense level by 16 levels.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-13\">Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i), 16 levels are added to the offense level of an alien illegally reentering the United States who has previously been convicted for a drug trafficking offense for which the sentence exceeded 13 months. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i) (2002). Given the commentary to that guideline provision, the court\u2019s consideration of the importation offense in its calculation of Jimenez-Mata\u2019s criminal history score was appropriate. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 comment, (n.5) (2002); <em>United States v. Boudreau, </em>250 F.3d 279, 285 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-18\">Jimenez-Mata cites <em>United States v. Henry, </em>288 F.3d 657 (5th Cir.2002), and <em>United States v. Cade, </em>279 F.3d 265 (5th Cir.2002), as support for his argument. However, neither of these decisions is apposite as neither involved illegal re-entry and, consequently, neither involved the application of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2. <em>See Henry, </em>288 F.3d at 658; <em>Cade, </em>279 F.3d at 268-69. The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1014-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cm. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
