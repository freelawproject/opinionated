Smoot, Jr., seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s order dismissing without prejudice his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (2000) petition, for failure to exhaust state remedies. We dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction because the notice of appeal was not timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-23\">Parties are accorded thirty days after the entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order in a civil case to note an appeal, Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(A), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5), or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). This appeal period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Dir., Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (quoting <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>361 U.S. 220, 229, 80 S.Ct. 282, 4 L.Ed.2d 259 (1960)).</p>\n<p id=\"b971-24\">The district court\u2019s order was entered on the docket on February 13, 2004. Giving Smoot the benefit of Fed. R.App. P. 4(c), the notice of appeal was filed on March 24, 2004. Because Smoot failed to file a timely notice of appeal or to obtain an extension or reopening of the appeal period, we dismiss the appeal. We deny Smoot\u2019s motion for a change of venue and for oral argument. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-25\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
