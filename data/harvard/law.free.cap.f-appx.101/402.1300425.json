Construing this pro se complaint liberally, <em>see Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972); <em>Gordon v. Leeke, </em>574 F.2d 1147, 1151 (4th Cir. 1978), we find that, contrary to the district court\u2019s conclusion, DePineres <em>did </em>seek monetary damages from Defendants Scott, Brown, and Choate for their alleged religious discrimination and violations of his First Amendment right by denying him Kosher meals.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, we vacate that portion of the district court\u2019s order dismissing this claim as moot and remand for further proceedings. We deny the Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the appeal<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and affirm the district court\u2019s order in all other respects for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>See DePineres v. Scott, </em>No. CA-02-248-5-BO (E.D.N.C. Sept. 26, 2003). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b437-8\">. DePineres explained in a motion filed on July 5, 2002, that, although he sought relief from the individual Defendants, he named Rivers Correctional Institution in his prayer for relief based on his belief that the corporation would pay any judgments entered against its employees for civil rights violations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b437-24\">. This appeal is timely under <em>Houston v. Lack, </em>487 U.S. 266, 276, 108 S.Ct. 2379, 101 L.Ed.2d 245 (1988), and Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(4).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
