Ginez-Perez contends that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (2) are unconstitutional. He therefore argues that his conviction must be reduced to one under the lesser included offense found in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1362(a), his judgment must be reformed to reflect a conviction only under that provision, and his sentence must be vacated and the ease remanded for resentencing to no more than two years\u2019 imprisonment and one year of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">In <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), the Supreme Court held that the enhanced penalties in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) are sentencing provisions, not elements of separate offenses. The Court further held that the sentencing provisions do not violate the Due Process Clause. <em>Id. </em>at 239-47. Ginez-Perez acknowledges that his arguments are foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>but asserts that the decision has been cast into doubt by <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). He seeks to preserve his arguments for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\"><em>Apprendi </em>did not overrule <em>AlmendarezTorres. See Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 489-90; <em>United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000). This court must follow <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>\u201cunless and until the Supreme Court itself determines to overrule it.\u201d <em>Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d at 984 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">The Government has moved for a summary affirmance in lieu of filing an appellee\u2019s brief. In its motion, the Government asks that an appellee\u2019s brief not be required. The motion is GRANTED.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-9\">AFFIRMED; MOTION GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"AOk\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
