Our review is limited to determining whether the Commissioner applied the proper legal standards and whether the decision is supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole. <em>See Bowling v. Shalala, </em>36 F.3d 431, 434 (5th Cir.1994). We may not reweigh the evidence or try the issues <em>de novo. See Johnson v. Bowen, </em>864 F.2d 340, 343 (5th Cir.1988). The record shows that the administrative law judge applied the proper legal standards and that the Commissioner\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence. <em>Bowling, </em>36 F.3d at 434.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-10\">We reject Wise\u2019s challenge to the hypothetical posed to the vocational expert. The hypothetical question that an administrative law judge poses to a vocational expert need only incorporate the disabilities that the administrative law judge recognizes. <em>Id. </em>at 435; <em>Morris v. Bowen, </em>864 F.2d 333, 336 (5th Cir.1988). Under <em>Bowling, </em>if the administrative law judge\u2019s hypothetical omits a recognized limitation \u201cand the claimant or his representative is afforded the opportunity to correct deficiencies in the administrative law judge\u2019s question by mentioning or suggesting to the vocational expert any purported defects in the hypothetical questions (including additional disabilities not recognized by the administrative law judge\u2019s findings and disabilities recognized but omitted from the question),\u201d there is no reversible error. <em>Bowling, </em>36 F.3d at 436.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-15\">Wise does not dispute that his representative was allowed to cross-examine the vocational expert regarding the administrative law judge\u2019s hypothetical. Thus, even assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that the administrative law judge\u2019s hypothetical was deficient in the respects urged on appeal, because Wise\u2019s representative was afforded an opportunity to correct any perceived deficiencies, there is no reversible error. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b985-16\">Contrary to Wise\u2019s argument, Social Security Ruling (SSR) 83-12 does not contradict the vocational expert\u2019s testimony that sedentary and light work does not necessarily entail bilateral manual dexterity. <em>See </em>SSR 83-12. Wise\u2019s argument that SSR 83-12 undercuts the vocational expert\u2019s testimony that he could perform sedentary work is also without merit. SSR 83-12 does not state that a person who does not exhibit bilateral manual dexterity is unable to perform sedentary work. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b985-17\">To the extent that Wise argues that his case should be remanded in accord with <em>Watson v. Barnhart, </em>288 F.3d 212 (5th Cir.2002), for a finding whether he can maintain employment, Wise did not assert that his condition only periodically pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>eluded him from working and did not offer medical evidence that his condition would intermittently prevent him from maintaining employment or functioning in the employment context. Accordingly, it is not necessary to remand the case for the administrative law judge to make such a determination. <em>See Frank v. Barnhart, </em>326 F.3d 618, 619-20 (5th Cir.2003). Given the foregoing, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b985-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
