Rodriguez reserved the right to appeal the denial of his motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-19\">It is the duty of this court to raise jurisdictional issues sua sponte, if necessary. <em>Mosley v. Cozby, </em>813 F.2d 659, 660 (5th Cir.1987). The magistrate judge recommended that Rodriguez\u2019s motion to suppress be denied, and Rodriguez objected. In their supplemental briefs requested by this court, both parties concede that the district court has not entered an order regarding the motion to suppress and that this issue is not ripe for appeal. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(C); <em>United States v. Raddatz, </em>447 U.S. 667, 681-82, 100 S.Ct. 2406, 65 L.Ed.2d 424 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-24\">The district court has not ruled on the suppression motion, and the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation that the motion be denied is not appealable to this court. <em>See United States v. Cooper, </em>135 F.3d 960, 961 (5th Cir.1998) (citing <em>Trufant v. Autocon, Inc., </em>729 F.2d 308, 309 (5th Cir.1984)). Accordingly, Rodriguez\u2019s appeal, which addresses only suppression issues, is DISMISSED for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-25\">APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1024-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
