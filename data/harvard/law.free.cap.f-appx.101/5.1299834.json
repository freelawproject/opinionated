The McBees sued the Government after the death of their son for the alleged negligence of Dr. Timothy Porea, who was an active member of the United States Navy at the time of their son\u2019s death. The McBees argue that the district court\u2019s judgment violates the holding in <em>Starnes v. United States, </em>139 F.3d 540 (5th Cir.1998), and that the \u201cborrowed servant\u201d doctrine violates public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-26\">The standard of review following the district court\u2019s order granting summary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>judgment is <em>de novo. Melton v. Teachers Ins. &amp; Annuity Ass\u2019n of America, </em>114 F.3d 557, 559 (5th Cir.1997). Summary judgment is proper if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with any affidavits filed in support of the motion, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R. Crv. P. 56(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\">Under the FTCA, \u201cthe Government is hable for the torts of its employees to the same extent as a private party would be under like circumstances, according to state law.\u201d <em>Starnes, </em>139 F.3d at 542; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2671-80. The Government may also assert the same defenses available to private parties, including the defense of the \u201cborrowed servant.\u201d <em>Starnes, </em>139 F.3d at 542. Texas law recognizes the defense of the \u201cborrowed servant\u201d where the employee of a general employer becomes the borrowed servant of another. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">The district court did not err in finding the facts of the instant case distinguishable from <em>Starnes. </em>The Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) in the instant case entered into between Porea and the Baylor College of Medicine (Baylor), reflects that Baylor exercised control over the medical treatment rendered by Porea. The MOU reflects that Porea was directly supervised by Baylor staff, not independent contractors. <em>Cf. Starnes, </em>139 F.3d at 542-43. Moreover, the testimony in the record from Rear Admiral Nancy Lescavage, the Commander of the Naval Medical Education and Training Command; from Dr. Kenneth McClain, Porea\u2019s supervising doctor and Baylor employee; and from Porea himself, establish that Baylor directly controlled the patient care rendered by Porea. The McBees have not presented any evidence to the contrary. <em>See Little v. Liquid Air Corp., </em>37 F.3d 1069, 1075 (5th Cir.1994) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">Although the terms of the MOU do not expressly assign liability to either party, the applicability of the FTCA does not render the Government automatically liable. <em>Compare Palmer v. Flaggman, </em>93 F.3d 196, 197-99 (5th Cir.1996), <em>with Starnes, </em>139 F.3d at 542-43. Subsequent to this court\u2019s holding in <em>Starnes, </em>the Texas Supreme Court extended the \u201cborrowed servant\u201d defense to physicians in <em>St. Joseph Hosp. v. Wolff, </em>94 S.W.3d 513, 537-39, 542-43 (Tex.2002). The MOU and summary judgment evidence in the instant case establish that the district court did not err in concluding that Porea was the \u201cborrowed servant\u201d of Baylor for vicarious liability purposes. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b39-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
