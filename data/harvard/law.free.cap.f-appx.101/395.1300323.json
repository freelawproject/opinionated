Riggins contends that the enforcement of his child support contract constituted \u201ctransacting any business\u201d pursuant to the Virginia Long Arm Statute, Va.Code Ann. \u00a7 8.01-328.1(A)(1) (Michie Supp.2002). The district court rejected this argument. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-12\">This court reviews de novo the district court\u2019s legal conclusions concerning personal jurisdiction. <em>Mylan Labs., Inc. v. Akzo, N.V., </em>2 F.3d 56, 60 (4th Cir.1993). When the district court decides a pretrial dismissal motion concerning personal jurisdiction without evidentiary hearings, then the plaintiff only has to prove a prima facie case of personal jurisdiction. <em>Id. </em>Further, all reasonable inferences are resolved in favor of the plaintiff. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b430-14\">A two-step analysis is normally used by this court in determining issues of personal jurisdiction. <em>Ellicott Mach. Corp., Inc. v. John Holland Party, Ltd., </em>995 F.2d 474, 477 (4th Cir.1993). A court must first determine whether the forum state\u2019s long-arm statute confers jurisdiction over the non-resident defendant. <em>Id. </em>Assuming the requirements of the forum state\u2019s long-arm statute have been satisfied, the court must next determine whether the exercise of personal jurisdiction over the non-resident defendant comports with federal constitutional standards of due process. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b430-15\">Virginia\u2019s Long Arm Statute states that: \u201cA court may exercise personal jurisdiction over a person, who acts directly or by an agent, as to a cause of action arising from the person\u2019s ... [transacting any business in this Commonwealth.\u201d Va.Code Ann. \u00a7 8.01-328.1(A)(1). Upon review, however, we conclude that this statute does not apply to domestic relations issues such as child support disputes, which are instead governed by Va.Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 8.01-328.1(A)(8), (9) (Michie Supp.2002). Accordingly we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal for lack of personal jurisdiction. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-16\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
