The district court referred these cases to a magistrate judge pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B) (2000). In each case the magistrate judge recommended that relief be denied and advised Sherman that failure to file timely, specific objections to the recommendation could waive appellate review of a district court order based upon the recommendation. Despite this warning, Sherman failed to specifically object to the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendations.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-26\">The timely filing of specific objections to a magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation is necessary to preserve appellate review of the substance of that recommendation when the parties have been warned that failure to object will waive appellate review. <em>See Wright v. Collins, </em>766 F.2d 841, 845-46 (4th Cir.1985); <em>see also Thomas v. Arn, </em>474 U.S. 140, 106 S.Ct. 466, 88 L.Ed.2d 435 (1985). Sherman has waived appellate review by failing to file specific objections after receiving proper notice. Accordingly, we deny leave to proceed in forma pauperis and dismiss the appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-27\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-28\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
