On appeal, Seymour challenges only the district court\u2019s failure to hold an evidentiary hearing on his oral motion to suppress evidence. Because his motion to suppress was not made until the middle of the trial, the district court denied it as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-7\">A motion to suppress evidence must be made before trial. Fed.R.Crim.P. 12(b)(3)(C). Failure to raise a motion by the deadline results in a waiver of the objection. Fed.R.Crim.P. 12(e). An evidentiary hearing is required on a motion to suppress \u201conly when necessary to receive evidence on an issue of fact.\u201d <em>United States v. Harrelson, </em>705 F.2d 733, 737 (5th Cir.1983). This court reviews a district court\u2019s refusal to conduct an evidentiary hearing on a motion to suppress for abuse of discretion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1002-8\">Because the district court denied the motion to suppress as untimely, the district court did not abuse its discretion by not holding an evidentiary hearing on its substantive merits. Seymour\u2019s appellate brief does not address the district court\u2019s conclusion that his motion to suppress was untimely; therefore, we will not consider this issue on appeal. <em>See Yokey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1002-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
