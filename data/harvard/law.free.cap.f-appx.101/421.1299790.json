We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>See Johnson v. Virginia, </em>No. CA-04-66-2 (E.D.Va. Jan. 30, 2004). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-21\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
