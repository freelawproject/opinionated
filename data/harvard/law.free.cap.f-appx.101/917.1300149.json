Wright was sentenced to 180 months incarceration, 5 years of supervised release, and a $100 special assessment. Wright appeals, asserting the district court erred in sentencing him as an armed career criminal under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b951-21\">We review a district court\u2019s factual findings at sentencing for clear error and its related legal conclusions, including the application of the Sentencing Guidelines, de novo. <em>United States v. Daughtrey, </em>874 F.2d 213, 217 (4th Cir.1989). Wright\u2019s assertion is meritless. The district court did not err in sentencing Wright as an armed career criminal. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) (2000); <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>246 F.3d 330, 333-35 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>534 U.S. 884, 122 S.Ct. 191, 151 L.Ed.2d 134 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b951-22\">Accordingly, we affirm Wright\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-23\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
