Ferguson (Ferguson), Texas prisoner # 1066554, appeals the dismissal of his civil rights action filed under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Ferguson contends that the defendants denied him adequate medical care for his hepatitis C in violation of the Eighth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-17\">The district court did not err in dismissing Ferguson\u2019s 42 U.S.C \u00a7 1983 action because Ferguson alleged no facts that would show that the defendants were deliberately indifferent to serious medical needs. <em>See Mendoza v. Lynaugh, </em>989 F.2d 191, 193 (5th Cir.1993). Documents Ferguson submitted with his complaint show that his hepatitis C has been monitored and treated based on his health status. The fact that Ferguson does not agree with what medical care is appropriate does not state a claim of deliberate indifference to serious medical needs. <em>See Norton v. Dimazana, </em>122 F.3d 286, 292 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-18\">For the first time on appeal, Ferguson argues the following: (1) Correctional Corp. of America (CCA) is using preferential treatment in treating inmates for hepatitis C, (2) CCA has retaliated against him for filing grievances and a civil suit, and (3) the Texas Department of Criminal Justice is denying him treatment for his hepatitis C. Because these issues are not purely legal, they may not be raised for the first time on appeal. <em>See Varnado v. Lynaugh, </em>920 F.2d 320, 321 (5th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-20\">Based on the foregoing, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. Ferguson\u2019s request for appointment of counsel is DENIED. The district court\u2019s dismissal of Ferguson\u2019s complaint for fail<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"982\">*982</page-number>ure to state a claim counts as a strike for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-388 (5th Cir.1996). Ferguson is WARNED that if he accumulates three strikes, he may not proceed <em>informa pauperis </em>in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-4\">AFFIRMED; MOTION FOR APPOINTMENT OF COUNSEL DENIED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1015-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
