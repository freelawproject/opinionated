Our independent review of the brief and the record discloses no non-frivolous issues for appeal. Counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities, and the appeal is DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b484-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
