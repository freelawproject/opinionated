Pasco and Brian K. Pasco, by and through their next friend Beverly A. Pasco (collectively, \u201cthe plaintiffs\u201d) appeal the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to Holly Springs, Mississippi (\u201cHolly Springs\u201d), on their 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claims and state law wrongful death claim alleging that Roy Gene Pasco, Jr. (\u201cPasco\u201d), was killed when his vehicle was bumped off the road by a Holly Springs police officer during a high speed chase. The plaintiffs argue that the district court erred by granting summary judgment to Holly Springs on their Fourth Amendment claim on the ground that there was no municipal liability as a matter of law. They further contend that the district court\u2019s alternative grant of summary judgment to Holly Springs on the merits of their Fourth Amendment claim was erroneous. Finally, they assert that the district court erred by granting summary judgment to Holly Springs on their state law wrongful death claim on the ground that it was barred by the Mississippi Tort Claims Act (\u201cMTCA\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-20\">We review the grant of a motion for summary judgment <em>de novo. Guillory v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number><em>Domtar Indus., Inc., </em>95 F.3d 1320, 1326 (5th Cir.1996). Summary judgment is appropriate when, considering all of the allegations in the pleadings, depositions, admissions, answers to interrogatories, and affidavits, and drawing inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c); <em>Little v. Liquid Air Corp., </em>37 F.3d 1069, 1075 (5th Cir.1994) (en banc). If the moving party meets his burden of showing that there is no genuine issue, the burden shifts to the nonmoving party to produce evidence or set forth specific facts showing the existence of a genuine issue for trial. Fed. R. Crv. P. 56(e); <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 324, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">The undisputed evidence before the district court showed that the supervisor on duty ordered the police officer in question, Brad Knoblauch (\u201cOfficer Knoblauch\u201d), to terminate his pursuit of Pasco prior to the accident that caused Pasco\u2019s death. The undisputed evidence also showed that Holly Springs\u2019s written policy on high speed chases by police officers provided that supervisors could order the termination of any pursuit. Accordingly, the district court did not err by finding that Holly Springs\u2019s policy regarding high speed chases did not give rise to municipal liability for the alleged constitutional violation. <em>See Spiller v. City of Texas City, Police Dep\u2019t, </em>130 F.3d 162, 167 (5th Cir. 1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">The plaintiffs\u2019s argument that <em>respondeat superior </em>liability should apply to municipalities in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 actions is foreclosed by the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Monell v. Dep\u2019t. of Soc. Servs. of City of New York, </em>436 U.S. 658, 691, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978), and <em>Board of County Comm\u2019rs of Bryan County, Okl. v. Brown, </em>520 U.S. 397, 403, 117 S.Ct. 1382, 137 L.Ed.2d 626 (1997). We cannot consider the plaintiffs\u2019s contention that those cases were wrongly decided as we are without the authority to overrule binding Supreme Court precedent. <em>See Rodriguez de Ouijas v. Shearson/American Exp. Inc., </em>490 U.S. 477, 484, 109 S.Ct. 1917, 104 L.Ed.2d 526 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">The undisputed evidence before the district court showed that Pasco was engaged in the criminal activities of driving under the influence of alcohol and fleeing from a police officer at the time of his death. <em>See </em>Miss.Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 63-11-30 &amp; 63-3202. As Pasco was engaged in criminal activities at the time of his death, the district court did not err by finding that the plaintiffs\u2019s state law wrongful death claim was barred by the MTCA. <em>See </em>Miss. Code Ann. \u00a7 11^16-9(l)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-8\">We need not reach the remainder of the plaintiffs\u2019s arguments on appeal. Despite the plaintiffs\u2019s request, we will not reach an issue we would not otherwise reach simply because the plaintiffs have recently filed a similar civil action against Officer Knoblauch individually. We do not have jurisdiction to issue advisory opinions. <em>Carpenter v. Witchita Falls Independent School Dist., </em>44 F.3d 362, 368 n. 5 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b41-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
