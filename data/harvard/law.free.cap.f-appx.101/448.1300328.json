He appeals the 46-month sentence imposed by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-23\">For the first time on appeal, Gonzalez argues that the district court erred by \u201crejecting\u201d his plea agreement at sentencing without giving him proper notice and a chance to withdraw his plea. This argument is factually frivolous because the district court did not reject Gonzalez\u2019 plea agreement. Instead, the district court merely rejected the Government\u2019s recommendation, contained in the plea agreement, that Gonzalez be sentenced at the low end of the applicable guideline range. Gonzalez has not shown error, plain or otherwise, with respect to this issue. <em>See United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732-34, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993); <em>United States v. Calverley, </em>37 F.3d 160, 162-64 (5th Cir.1994) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-24\">Gonzalez also argues for the first time on appeal that the district court erred in sentencing him at the top of the applicable guideline range. Because the district court imposed a sentence from within the applicable guideline range and that sentence was not in violation of law, the district court did not abuse its discretion in selecting Gonzalez\u2019 sentence. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B); <em>United States v. Matovsky, </em>935 F.2d 719, 721 (5th Cir. 1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-25\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b482-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R.5 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
