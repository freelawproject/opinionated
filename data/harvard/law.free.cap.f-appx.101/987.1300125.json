Judge Furgesoris actions in no way violated any canon of judicial ethics. Nor did he err in continuing to act after a motion for recusal was filed. Judge Furgeson possessed authority under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 144 to rule on the legal sufficiency of the facts alleged to show bias or prejudice. <em>Davis v. Board of School Comm\u2019rs of Mobile County, </em>517 F.2d 1044, 1051 (5th Cir.), <em>reh\u2019g denied </em>521 F.2d 814, <em>cert. denied </em>425 U.S. 944, 96 S.Ct. 1685, 48 L.Ed.2d 188 (1976). Judge Furgesoris authority to issue orders in this case continued until there was notice of appeal from the final judgment. <em>In re Transtexas Gas Corp., </em>303 F.3d 571, 579 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-18\">After examining the record, we find no error of Judge Furgeson. The appellants have pursued complaints in the district court and this court that have no arguable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"989\">*989</page-number>legal merit. Only because they act pro se without legal advice sanctions will not be ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-5\">The motion for sanctions is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-6\">The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1022-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
