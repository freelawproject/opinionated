Borunda was sentenced to 120 months\u2019 imprisonment, to be followed by a five-year term of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-23\">Prosecutorial misconduct was an exception to the appeal waiver provision in Borunda\u2019s plea agreement, and Borunda argues that his waiver was invalid because the prosecutor engaged in misconduct in asserting that Borunda was not eligible for application of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2, the safety valve provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-24\">The evidence presented showed that the agents did not believe that Borunda had provided them with all the information or evidence that he possessed, and the district court agreed with the agents by refusing to apply the safety valve provision. Borunda has not demonstrated any act of misconduct on the part of the prosecutor in connection with the district court\u2019s decision not to apply the safety valve provision. Thus, Borunda was not entitled to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"966\">*966</page-number>rely on the prosecutorial misconduct exception to the waiver provision in his plea agreement. Borunda has not otherwise shown that the waiver was unknowingly and involuntarily entered. <em>See United States v. Melancon, </em>972 F.2d 566, 567-68 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-4\">Borunda cannot overcome the waiver by arguing that his sentence was illegal because such argument was not excepted from the waiver. The waiver in Borunda\u2019s plea agreement must be enforced, and the appeal DISMISSED. We need not address Borunda\u2019s claim that the district court erred in refusing to apply the safety valve provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-5\">APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b999-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
