She argues that the defendants failed to protect her from being attacked by a fellow inmate. However, because Peyton has not provided facts indicating that the defendants were informed of a prior altercation between Peyton and the other inmate or of Peyton\u2019s wish to be moved away from the other inmate, nor has she shown that the prior altercation posed a \u201csubstantial risk of serious harm,\u201d she has failed to show that the defendants acted with deliberate indifference. <em>See Woods v. Edwards, </em>51 F.3d 577, 583 (5th Cir.1995); <em>Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 837, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-7\">Peyton also claims that defendant Thompson laughed at her at the time of the incident, \u201ctherefore taking my life as a joke.\u201d However, such actions do not amount to constitutional violations under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. <em>See Calhoun v. Hargrove, </em>312 F.3d 730, 734 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-8\">Peyton\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is thus frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, we DISMISS her appeal as frivolous. 5th Cir. R. 42.2. The dismissal of this appeal as frivolous counts as a \u201cstrike\u201d under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 385-87 (5th Cir.1996). Peyton is WARNED that if she accumulates three \u201cstrikes\u201d under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), she will not be able to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while she is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless she is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-11\">APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1017-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
