We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-6\">We reject King\u2019s contention that the district court plainly erred in determining the relevant drug quantity; the district court was not bound by the quantity of drugs mentioned in the indictment, insofar as quantities of drugs not specified in the count of conviction may be considered as relevant conduct for purposes of determining the offense level. <em>See United States v. Sarasti, </em>869 F.2d 805, 806-07 (5th Cir.1989); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, comment. (n.12) (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b993-7\">We hold that the extent of the district court\u2019s downward departure was not plainly erroneous. <em>See United States v. Vasquez, </em>216 F.3d 456, 459 (5th Cir.2000); <em>United States v. Lemons, </em>941 F.2d 309, 320 (5th Cir.1991). We further hold that King\u2019s criminal history was accurately represented in the Presentence Report; his criminal history score reflects no prior convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-8\">Insofar as King contends that the district court should have ordered that he receive substance abuse treatment while incarcerated, the decision whether a prisoner receives treatment for substance abuse is left to the discretion of the Bureau of Prisons, and, therefore, it was beyond the district court\u2019s authority to order his participation in a drug treatment program while incarcerated. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3621(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b993-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b993-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
