Josey appeals the dismissal for failure to state a claim of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 suit under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A. The district court determined that Josey\u2019s allegations were barred by <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). Josey argues that no probable cause existed for his arrest for driving while intoxicated and that the exclusionary rule was violated when he was not read his rights under <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). Josey does not argue that the <em>Heck </em>bar does not apply. Consequently, Josey has waived that argument. <em>See Cinel v. Connick, </em>15 F.3d 1338, 1345 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-22\">Josey asserts that he was only required to give fair notice of his claims in his complaint, but he also concedes that the district court was required to screen his suit. To the extent that Josey argues that he was entitled to notice before the dismissal of his claims, his argument fails. <em>See Graves v. Hampton, </em>1 F.3d 315, 318 n. 12 (5th Cir.1993), <em>abrogated on other grounds, Arvie v. Broussard, </em>42 F.3d 249, 250 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b44-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>Josey also argues that he was denied his right to a speedy trial. The district court implicitly denied Josey the opportunity to amend his action by not expressly addressing and resolving this issue that Josey raised for the first time in his objections. However, by raising his speedy-trial argument, Josey is contesting his continued confinement. Because Josey\u2019s continued confinement has not been remedied by any of the procedures listed in <em>Heck, </em>his speedy-trial claim also is not cognizable under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. <em>See Heck, </em>512 U.S. at 486-87. Consequently, the district court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to allow such an amendment. <em>See United States v. Riascos, </em>76 F.3d 93, 94 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. Josey\u2019s motion to strike from the record any \u201crulings, judgments, and IT] or orders\u201d entered by the district court after his notice of appeal was filed and motion entitled \u201cViolation of 5th Cir. R. 46.3 by attorney Carlos D. Lopez\u201d are DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b43-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
