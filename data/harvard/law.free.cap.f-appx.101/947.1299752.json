The arbitrator returned a decision on April 12, 2002. Plaintiff appealed that decision on February 26, 2003. The district court dismissed his claims under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). We affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal as the relevant statute of limitations provides only three months to appeal from arbitration orders. 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 12. As Hudson was appealing an arbitration order rather than a district court order, the district court properly applied \u00a7 12 rather than Fed. R. Crv. P. 60(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b981-18\">Any equal protection claims against the district court are barred by judicial immunity. Mi<em>reles v.
