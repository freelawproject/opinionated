DamianGareia argues that the district court erred by characterizing his state felony conviction for simple possession of cocaine as an \u201caggravated felony\u201d for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C), when that same offense is punishable only as a misdemean- or under federal law. This issue, however, is foreclosed by our precedent. <em>See United States v. Caicedo-Cuero, </em>312 F.3d 697, 706-11 (5th Cir.2002), <em>cert. denied, </em>538 U.S. 1021, 123 S.Ct. 1948, 155 L.Ed.2d 864 (2003); <em>United States v. Hinojosa-Lopez, </em>130 F.3d 691, 693-94 (5th Cir.1997). Damian-Garcia has not shown that the district court erred by characterizing his state conviction as an aggravated felony for U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C) purposes and by sentencing him accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">Damian-Gareia argues that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) is unconstitutional on its face and as applied in his case because it does not require the fact of a prior felony or aggravated felony conviction to be charged in the indictment and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. This argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). <em>See United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-13\">Damian-Gareia has shown no error in the district court\u2019s judgment. Accordingly, that judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b500-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
