Garza argues that the district court erred in determining that his sentence runs consecutively to his prior state sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-10\">Garza is not entitled to credit toward his federal sentence for time served on his state sentences because he received credit on his state sentences until he was released into federal custody. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3585(b); <em>Leal v. Tombone, </em>341 F.3d 427, 428, 430 (5th Cir.2003). Furthermore, because the federal judgment did not state whether Garza\u2019s sentence was to be served concurrently with or consecutively to his state sentences, the sentences are deemed to run consecutively. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584(a). Therefore, the district court did not err in determining that Garza\u2019s federal and state sentences run consecutively.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-15\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1008-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
