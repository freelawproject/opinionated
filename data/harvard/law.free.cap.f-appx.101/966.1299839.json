That testimony concerned specific information about possible sentencing reductions that the agent provided to Gonzalez during his interrogation. Because other law enforcement agents testified that Gonzalez already had confessed before being advised of possible sentence reductions, and because the jury heard some testimony that Gonzalez had been advised of the possibility of sentencing reductions during his interrogation, we conclude that any error in excluding the specific testimony was harmless. <em>See Delaware v. Van Arsdall, </em>475 U.S. 673, 681, 106 S.Ct. 1431, 89 L.Ed.2d 674 (1986) (\u201c[A]n otherwise valid conviction should not be set aside if ... the constitutional error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-6\">Gonzalez also argues that the Government failed to prove that he knowingly possessed the type and amount of controlled substance alleged in the indictment. As Gonzalez concedes, this argument is foreclosed by this court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Gamez-Gonzalez, </em>319 F.3d 695, 700 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied </em>538 U.S. 1068, 123 S.Ct. 2241, 155 L.Ed.2d 1126 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1000-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
