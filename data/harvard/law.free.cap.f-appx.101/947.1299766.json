Aloysius challenges the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to set aside the order revoking his naturalization on due process grounds, arguing that he should have the opportunity to be heard on the factual basis for the revocation. Appellant also contends that the district court lacked jurisdiction, because the Government\u2019s motion to vacate the naturalization was not timely. We review a ruling on a motion for relief from judgment for abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Finding the Government\u2019s motion to vacate timely and no due process violations, we conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"949\">*949</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-5\">Aloysius first challenges the district court\u2019s jurisdiction to vacate his naturalization.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Following Aloysius\u2019 naturalization proceedings, the United States moved to vacate the naturalization decree, urging that Aloysius obtained his naturalization by fraud, that is, by answering questions falsely and concealing his involvement in drug trafficking that would have disqualified him for naturalization. Aloysius complains that the district court lacked jurisdiction because the Government filed its motion to vacate more than a year after he was administratively accepted for naturalization.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-6\">The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure require that a motion for relief from judgment based on fraud be filed \u201cnot more than a year after the judgment, order, or proceedings was entered or taken.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Although Aloysius was administratively accepted for naturalization on his interview date, February 10, 1993, he was naturalized by the court at an oath ceremony on April 16, 1993.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Government filed its Rule 60(b) motion to vacate on March 24, 1994 \u2014 within a year of those proceedings but beyond a year from the interview date.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-7\">We are not persuaded by Appellant\u2019s contention that the appropriate date to count from was the date he was interviewed. Aloysius argues without citation to authority that the later ceremonial date was a mere formality. An oath ceremony is required for admission to citizenship by statute and regulation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Aloysius was naturalized by the court when he took the oath of allegiance on April 16, 1993, and the one-year period for the Government\u2019s Rule 60(b) was set into motion by those proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-13\">The court did not abuse its discretion in denying Aloysius relief based on untimeliness of the Government\u2019s motion to vacate.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-14\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-15\">Aloysius next contends that reversal is warranted because he was entitled to a due process hearing to determine the accuracy of the information used by the Government in seeking to vacate his naturalization.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-16\">The record reflects that Aloysius did receive due process. The Government served him notice by mailing its motion to vacate both to his residence and to the federal detention center. A court order advised the parties of the hearing date and time. Aloysius did not respond or appear. Upon granting the Government\u2019s motion, the court allowed Aloysius an additional opportunity to be heard by granting him thirty days to submit a memorandum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"950\">*950</page-number>showing why his petition for naturalization should not be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-4\">Apparently as part of his due process challenge, Aloysius also presents an argument about the sequence of events, noting that on the dates of his statements, February 10 and April 16 of 1993, he could not possibly have known that he would be indicted in December of that year and convicted in the following February. The jury found Aloysius guilty of a conspiracy to import heroin that lasted from early October 1992 to September 8, 1993. On this record the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding Appellant made material misrepresentations in 1993 concerning a crime for which he had not been arrested and illicit trafficking in drugs. We find no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s denying Aloysius relief from the judgment based on due process concerns.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-6\">Upon our finding of no reversible error, the judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b984-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b982-13\">.
