The district court granted Cothran a certificate of appealability with respect to specified claims alleging suppression of exculpatory evidence and ineffective assistance of counsel. Upon consideration of those claims, we affirm the denial of relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-16\">I. <em>Facts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b420-17\">On September 29, 1996, Cothran shot and killed Todd Gouldine. The killing occurred in Cothran\u2019s home, in front of two eyewitnesses \u2014 Arlene White (Cothran\u2019s girlfriend), and Elizabeth Brooks (Gouldine\u2019s girlfriend).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-18\">Cothran was charged in Virginia state court with murder. At trial, Brooks testified that she was watching television while Cothran and Gouldine talked and drank, and she heard a shot. She then turned and saw Cothran fire a second shot, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>hit Gouldine in the head; Brooks testified that as Cothran fired the shot, he said, \u201cM \u2014 f\u2014, you\u2019re dead.\u201d J.A. 227 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">For his part, Cothran claimed that the shooting was an accident. He testified that Gouldine became belligerent after drinking too much, so Cothran picked up his pistol to prevent Gouldine from using it. There was a struggle, and Cothran fired a warning shot. After that, Gouldine started to leave, but then he turned and tried to grab Cothran\u2019s gun, which went off and shot Gouldine in the head. When cross-examined about the contradictions between this story and the physical evidence, Cothran claimed that the coroner was \u201ccoached.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 410.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">Cothran was convicted of second degree murder. After four unsuccessful challenges in state court (two motions for new trial, an appeal, and a habeas petition), Cothran filed a habeas application in federal court. The district court denied relief but granted a certificate of appealability as to certain claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">II. <em>Failure to Disclose Exculpatory Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">Cothran first contends that the prosecution improperly withheld statements that Brooks made to the police, in violation of <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), and its progeny. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-9\">The statements in question did not directly support Cothran\u2019s defense, but they included two items that could have been used for impeachment. First, a police officer said that Brooks had told him\u2014 immediately after the shooting and while still in great distress \u2014 that Cothran had shot Gouldine with a shotgun; in fact, Cothran had used a pistol. (Shortly after the shooting, Cothran locked himself in his bathroom with a shotgun and said he was going to kill himself to avoid being imprisoned for shooting Gouldine.) The state court held that this statement had minimal impeachment value, and thus did not constitute material exculpatory evidence subject to disclosure under <em>Brady, </em>because (a) there was no dispute at trial about what weapon Cothran used; (b) Brooks denied having called the weapon a shotgun (suggesting that the officer may have recorded the statement incorrectly); and (c) if Brooks did err in describing the gun, this was understandable in light of her emotional state. Because this determination was not unreasonable, Cothran is not entitled to habeas relief. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2254(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-11\">The second set of relevant items from Brooks\u2019 statements included her repeated assertions that Cothran and Gouldine had not argued prior to the shooting and that \u201cthere was nothing that was said,\u201d J.A. 157. At Cothran\u2019s preliminary hearing, however, Brooks testified that Cothran had said \u201cyou\u2019re dead\u201d before firing the second shot, <em>id. </em>at 174 (internal quotation marks omitted); then, at trial, Brooks quoted Cothran as saying \u201cM \u2014 f\u2014, you\u2019re dead,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 227 (internal quotation marks omitted). The district court found that these statements had no impeachment value because Brooks\u2019 statement that there was no argument prior to the <em>first </em>shot was not inconsistent with her testimony that Cothran said \u201cyou\u2019re dead\u201d prior to the <em>second </em>shot. Cothran claims that \u201cthere is no factual support for the district court\u2019s scenario,\u201d Br. of Appellant Richard Alvin Cothran at 30, but in fact Brooks\u2019 testimony directly supports the analysis by the district court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-12\">Q. Did you hear Mr. Cothran say anything before the first shot?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-13\">A. Well, before the first shot they were laughing and carrying on, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>that\u2019s when I heard the gun go off the first time. And then the second time yeah, he said [\u201cM \u2014 f\u2014, you\u2019re dead\u201d].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A0JU\">J.A. 227. We therefore affirm the denial of relief on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">III. <em>Ineffective Assistance of Counsel</em></p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">Cothran next contends that his trial attorney (Haskins) provided ineffective assistance by (a) conducting an inadequate investigation concerning Elizabeth Brooks and cross-examining her deficiently, (b) failing to interview Sherri Anne Priest and call her as a witness, and (c) failing to call Arlene White as a witness. To establish that he received ineffective assistance of counsel, Cothran must make two showings: \u201cFirst, [he] must show that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient.... Second, [he] must show that the deficient performance prejudiced [his] defense.\u201d <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">Cothran claims that if Haskins had conducted an adequate investigation regarding Brooks, he would have discovered evidence useful for impeachment. During state habeas proceedings, Brooks provided an affidavit averring that, had Haskins interviewed her, she would have told him that she did not remember the shooting incident clearly. She allegedly made the same disclosure before trial in a statement to the police and in conversation with Sherri-Anne Priest. Cothran asserts that Haskins was unable to impeach Brooks\u2019 testimony effectively because he failed to review Brooks\u2019 statement, failed to interview Brooks, and failed to interview and/or subpoena Priest. We will address Cothran\u2019s claim concerning Priest in Part III.B, <em>infra. </em>As to the balance of this claim, we hold that the decision of the state habeas court was not unreasonable and that Cothran therefore is not entitled to relief. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2254(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-9\">The state habeas court denied relief on this claim based on arguments advanced by the Commonwealth. As noted in these arguments, Brooks admitted at trial that she had taken medication that made her less alert at the time of the shooting, but she also denied having told Cothran that she did not remember the incident clearly. Also, she provided fully consistent descriptions of the inculpatory details of the shooting when she was interviewed by the police, when she testified at a pre-trial hearing, and when she testified during trial. Under the circumstances, it is not likely that Brooks would have told Has-kins \u2014 before or during trial \u2014 that her memory of the relevant events was impaired, nor is it likely that such a declaration would have rendered her testimony less credible. Accordingly, the state court could reasonably conclude that Haskins\u2019 performance, even if deficient, did not result in prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-10\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-11\">We now turn to Cothran\u2019s claim regarding Priest, a close friend of Brooks. At a hearing after Cothran\u2019s trial, Priest testified that Brooks had said she did not remember the shooting incident clearly, once in a conversation with Priest and once in a conversation with Cothran that Priest observed. Cothran claims that Haskins performed deficiently in failing to obtain this information before trial by interviewing Priest.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-12\">In rejecting this same claim, the state habeas court relied on the Commonwealth\u2019s argument that Haskins attempted to interview Priest but she refused to cooperate. If Priest refused to discuss the case with Haskins before trial (as she admitted when she testified after trial), then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>Haskins\u2019 failure to interview Priest did not amount to deficient performance. <em>See Duckett v. Mullin, </em>306 F.3d 982, 998 (10th Cir.2002) (\u201cIt would be unreasonable to deem trial counsel ineffective for failing to discover potential mitigating evidence when counsel conducted a reasonable investigation but was stymied by potential witnesses who were not forthcoming.\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>538 U.S. 1004, 123 S.Ct. 1911, 155 L.Ed.2d 834 (2003). Furthermore, although Haskins could still have obtained Priest\u2019s testimony by subpoenaing her, his decision not to do so when he could not confirm what her testimony would be was well within the bounds of competent representation, particularly in light of her hostile attitude. <em>See Jones v. Murray, </em>947 F.2d 1106, 1113 (4th Cir.1991) (holding that counsel did not perform deficiently in declining to call a witness who was likely to present \u201ca cool and reserved demeanor\u201d while testifying). Accordingly, the state court decision denying relief on this claim was not unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">Finally, Cothran claims that Haskins should have called Arlene White as a witness. As noted above, White was dating Cothran when the shooting occurred (they have since married and divorced), and she was present at the time of the shooting. Haskins chose not to use her as a witness because she had a criminal record; he felt that her convictions could be used to undermine her credibility and tarnish Cothran by association. The state court concluded that this was a reasonable basis for declining to use White\u2019s testimony. This conclusion was not unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">Cothran emphasizes that Haskins mistakenly believed that White could be questioned about the details of her offenses. But even without that mistake, Haskins could reasonably have opted not to call White as a witness. Moreover, the failure to use her testimony was not prejudicial, as she would have lacked credibility in light of her relationship with Cothran and her acknowledged efforts to conform her testimony to his statements. Cothran therefore is not entitled to relief on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-9\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-10\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the denial of habeas relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
