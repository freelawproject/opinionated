Amlesom, a female native and citizen of Eritrea, petitions for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 (\u201cBIA\u201d) summary affirmance of an immigration judge\u2019s denial of her applications for asylum, withholding of removal, protection under the United Nations\u2019 Convention Against Torture, and voluntary departure. We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-11\">On appeal, Amlesom raises challenges to the immigration judge\u2019s determination that she failed to establish her eligibility for asylum. To obtain reversal of a determination denying eligibility for relief, an alien \u201cmust show that the evidence he presented was so compelling that no reasonable fact-finder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). <em>See also Blanco de Belbruno v. Ashcroft, </em>362 F.3d 272, 284 (4th Cir.2004) (immigration judge\u2019s denial of asylum upheld \u201cunless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary\u201d). Administrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B) (2000). We have reviewed the evidence of record and conclude that Amlesom fails to show that the evidence compels a contrary result. Accordingly, we cannot grant the relief Amlesom seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-13\">Additionally, we uphold the immigration judge\u2019s denial of Amlesom\u2019s applications for withholding of removal and protection under the Convention Against Torture. To qualify for withholding of removal, an applicant must demonstrate \u201ca clear probability of persecution.\u201d <em>INS v. Cardozar-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 430-31, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987). To obtain relief under the Convention Against Torture, an applicant must establish that \u201cit is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2) (2003). Based on our review of the record, we find that Amlesom has failed to meet either one of these standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-14\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-15\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
