For the reasons discussed below, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-20\">Toure disputes the IJ\u2019s conclusion that she was firmly resettled in the Ivory Coast and lacked a well-founded fear of persecution in Mali. To obtain reversal of a determination denying eligibility for relief, an alien \u201cmust show that the evidence he presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We have reviewed the evidence of record and conclude that Toure fails to show that the evidence compels a contrary result. <em>See Mussie v. INS, </em>172 F.3d 329, 331-32 (4th Cir.1999); <em>Huaman-Cornelio v. Board of Immigration Appeals, </em>979 F.2d 995, 999 (4th Cir.1992). Accordingly, we cannot grant the relief that she seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-21\">Additionally, we reject Toure\u2019s contention that the Board\u2019s summary affirmance of the IJ\u2019s decision violated her rights under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. <em>See Blanco de Belbruno v. Ashcroft, </em>362 F.3d 272, 280-83 (4th Cir. 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-22\">We therefore deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-23\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
