Keating sought reduction of his sentence based on Amendment 591 to the sentencing guidelines. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-28\">We review the denial of a motion to modify sentence for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Turner, </em>59 F.3d 481, 483 (4th Cir.1995). The sentencing court may reduce a defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment if his sentence was based on a sentencing range subsequently lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Section 1B1.10 of the sentencing guidelines provides that, where the guidelines range applicable to a defendant has subsequently been lowered as a result of an amendment listed in subsection (c), a reduction is authorized under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number><em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 1B1.10 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\">Amendment 591 is one of the listed amendments that applies retroactively. USSG \u00a7 lB1.10(c). Amendment 591 requires the sentencing court to apply the offense guideline referenced in the Statutory Index in Appendix A for the statute of conviction. USSG App. C, Amend. 591. The amendment clarified USSG \u00a7\u00a7 1B1.1 and 1B1.2, which some circuits previously interpreted as permitting a court to use an offender\u2019s actual conduct in selecting the offense guideline, even if that conduct was not charged in the indictment. <em>See United States v. Rivera, </em>293 F.3d 584, 586-87 (2d Cir.2002). We find that the district court acted in accordance with USSG \u00a7\u00a7 1B1.1 and IB 1.2 at sentencing when it consulted the Statutory Index and referred to USSG \u00a7 2D1.1 as the proper guideline for Keating\u2019s convictions under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841, 846 (2000). <em>See </em>USSG, App. A.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">Keating argues that his guideline range was improperly based on quantities and types of drugs determined by the sentencing court, resulting in a base offense level higher than the offense level supported by the facts alleged in the indictment or found by the jury. Keating is confused, however, because Amendment 591 does not impact how the base offense level is calculated within the appropriate guideline. Instead, Amendment 591 affects which guideline will be used in determining the base offense level. Here, Keating does not challenge the guidelines used by the district court; he simply challenges the court\u2019s application of the guideline, an issue not addressed by Amendment 591.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Keating\u2019s motion. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
