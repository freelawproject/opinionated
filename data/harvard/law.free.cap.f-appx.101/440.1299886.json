The district court sentenced Cuellar to 41 months\u2019 imprisonment, followed by two years\u2019 supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-25\">Cuellar argues that the district court\u2019s factual finding underlying his denial of a downward departure was clearly erroneous. This court has no jurisdiction to re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>view the district court\u2019s decision because \u201cthe court\u2019s refusal is based on its determination that the departure is not warranted on the facts of the case.\u201d <em>United States v. Buck, </em>324 F.3d 786, 797 (5th Cir.2003). This portion of Cuellar\u2019s appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">Cuellar also argues that the offense for which he was indicted has a maximum sentence of two years\u2019 imprisonment because the indictment did not allege that he had a prior conviction for an aggravated felony. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a), (b). Cuellar acknowledges that his argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), but he asserts that the decision has been cast into doubt by <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). He seeks to preserve his argument for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\"><em>Apprendi </em>did not overrule <em>AlmendarezTorres. See Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 489-90; <em>United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000). This court must follow <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>\u201cunless and until the Supreme Court itself determines to overrule it.\u201d <em>Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d at 984 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). This part of the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">APPEAL DISMISSED FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION IN PART; AFFIRMED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b474-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under tire limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
