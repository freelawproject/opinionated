We have reviewed the record and conclude that the Board did not abuse its discretion in upholding the denial of Conteh\u2019s motion to reopen. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a) (2003); <em>INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 323-24, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992). The record reveals that the notice was mailed to Conteh\u2019s last known address and that she failed to keep the immigration court apprised of changes in her address. See 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252b(a)(l)(F) (1994) (\u201c[T]he alien must provide the Attorney General immediately with a written record of any change of the alien\u2019s address\u201d); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252b(a)(2) (1994)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (\u201c[Wjritten notice shall not be required under this paragraph if the alien has failed to provide the address required under subsection (a)(1)(F)\u201d); <em>Dominguez v. United States Atty. Gen., </em>284 F.3d 1258, 1260 (11th Cir.2002). We find no abuse of discretion under these circumstances. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-12\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b977-10\">. The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA) repealed 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1252b(a)(l)(F) &amp; (a)(2) effective April 1, 1997. Nearly identical language now appears in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1229(a)(1)(F) &amp; 1229a(5)(b) (1999). Under the IIRIRA, \u00a7\u00a7 1252b(a)(l)(F) &amp; (a)(2) continue to apply because this case was in progress before the act was passed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
