As part of her written plea agreement, Minor expressly waived her right to appeal her sentence, and acknowledged that drug weight was a factual matter to be determined by the district court, that the court could find her responsible for a higher or lower amount, and that such determination of drug weight by the district court was not a basis on which she could rely to seek to withdraw her plea. Following a proper Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 hearing, the district court accepted Minor\u2019s plea and sentenced her to forty-six months\u2019 imprisonment, three years of supervised release, and a $100 special assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-26\">Minor claims on appeal that the district court erred in adopting the drug weight set forth in her presentence report, rather than that set out in her plea agreement. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>As to this claim, we find that Minor knowingly and voluntarily waived her right to appeal. <em>United States v. Marin, </em>961 F.2d 493, 496 (4th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">We therefore dismiss Minor\u2019s appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
