We find no error in the jury instructions, and no error in the admission of prior convictions based on <em>nolo conten-dere </em>pleas for impeachment purposes, and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-25\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-26\">The Sonny Mitchell Center is a strip mall shopping center located in San Antonio, Texas. The Center houses seven separate businesses \u2014 Sonny Mitchell\u2019s Grocery, Youngster\u2019s Restaurant, J\u2019s Barber &amp; Beauty Shop, Sonny\u2019s Washateria, Gloria\u2019s Liquor Store, Full Effect (a bar and pool hall), and Thriller lee House \u2014 one vacant building, and a common parking lot. According to undercover officers of the San Antonio Police Department, the Center was a haven for drug dealers between 1985 and 1990; and until the government seized the property, various individuals used, sold, and purchased drugs in plain view day and night.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-27\">On June 12, 1990, the government filed an <em>in rem </em>civil complaint for forfeiture of the Center pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 881(a)(7). Section 881(a)(7), part of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>Drug Abuse Control and Prevention Act, authorizes the forfeiture of any tract of land used in any manner or part to commit a crime involving drugs unless the crime occurred \u201cwithout the knowledge or consent of that owner.\u201d Gaylon (\u201cSonny\u201d) and Pattie Mitchell subsequently filed claims of ownership and answers to the complaint. After a hearing, the district court found probable cause for the seizure. The case then proceeded to a jury trial on the issue of the Mitchells\u2019 \u201cinnocent owner\u201d defense, and the jury rejected the defense. The Mitchells now appeal to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">A. <em>The Jury Instruction.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">The Mitchells contended at trial that the Center covered eight separate tracts of land. They requested that the district court divide the jury charge and the verdict form into eight separate questions, so that the jury could consider their \u201cinnocent owner\u201d defense separately for each tract. But the district court refused the request because it believed that the facts of the case did not warrant such a division. As the court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-7\">I do not believe that any reasonable jury could find an innocent owner defense as to one lot on the Sonny Mitchell Center and not on the other lots. Given the evidence that we have before the court now in this case, this is a factual matter, and the court does not feel that there is sufficient evidence for this to be able to be divided up and say that Mr. or Mrs. Mitchell might have consented to one tract and not the other tract given the facts as they\u2019ve developed in this case and the fact that this was one big shopping center.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-9\">The Mitchells\u2019 appeal of the instruction implicates a subject of some controversy, the scope of \u00a7 881(a)(7). Most courts have held that drug activity on any portion of a tract of land forfeits the entire tract. <em>See United States v. Real Property and Residence at 3907 S. W. 111th Avenue, </em>921 F.2d 1551, 1557 (11th Cir.1991); <em>United States v. One 107.9 Acre Parcel of Land, </em>898 F.2d 396, 400 (3rd Cir.1990); <em>United States v. A Parcel of Land with a Building Located Thereon at 40 Moon Hill Road, </em>884 F.2d 41, 44-45 (1st Cir.1989); <em>United States v. Santoro, </em>866 F.2d 1538, 1543 (4th Cir. 1989); <em>United States v. Tax Lot 1500, 300 Cove Rd., </em>861 F.2d 232, 235 (9th Cir.1988); <em>United States v. Littlefield, </em>821 F.2d 1365, 1367 (9th Cir.1987). At the same time, courts have at least recognized that a single land area can contain several contiguous tracts. <em>See United States v. Approximately 50 Acres of Real Property, </em>920 F.2d 900, 901 n. 1 (11th Cir.1991); <em>Santoro, </em>866 F.2d at 1543; <em>United States v. Reynolds, </em>856 F.2d 675 (4th Cir.1988). The definition of a \u201ctract\u201d of land, therefore, is important.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b164-10\">Fortunately, we need not decide whether the Center actually contained multiple tracts. Like the district court, we believe that a single instruction was appropriate under the facts of this case. The real issue before the jury was whether the Mitchells consented to the drug activity on their property. As the Mitchells\u2019 own lawyer stated in closing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-11\">You\u2019d almost have to be an ostrich or something not to know that something was going on there, that there was illegal activity going on out there, but that\u2019s a far different cry from saying that you approve of it, and that you consented with it, and that you agreed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>with it, and that you joined it. There\u2019s a big difference.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">Although the testimony about specific drug transactions was particular as to location, most of the testimony related to consent was quite general \u2014 the Mitchells and their witnesses asserted that the Mitchells did not consent to the drug trafficking and attempted to stop it, and the government\u2019s witnesses contended that the drug activity occurred with the Mitchells\u2019 tacit approval. Furthermore, because much of the drug activity occurred on a common parking lot, any efforts by the Mitchells to stop the drug trafficking would have evidenced lack of consent as to more than one tract. In sum, the jury was faced with a credibility choice, and it would be unreasonable to conclude that the jury might have credited the Mitchells over the government\u2019s witnesses as to one of the tracts, but made an opposite credibility choice as to the other tracts, had the requested instructions been given.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">B. <em>The Impeachment with Prior Convictions.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">Gaylon Mitchell testified at the trial, and over the Mitchells\u2019 objection, the district court allowed the government to impeach him with four prior felony drug convictions. All four convictions were entered pursuant to pleas of <em>nolo contendere. </em>The Mitchells now contend that the admission of the prior convictions was reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-9\">Before the adoption of the Federal Rules of Evidence, it was the rule in this circuit that convictions based on <em>nolo contendere </em>pleas were inadmissible for impeachment purposes. <em>Piassick v. United States, </em>253 F.2d 658 (5th Cir.1958); <em>Mickler v. Fahs, </em>243 F.2d 515 (5th Cir.1957). The drafters of the Federal Rules considered an exception to Fed.R.Evid. 609 that would have expressly prohibited impeachment with pleas of <em>nolo contendere. </em>However, this exception was deleted from the final draft. <em>See </em>3 J. Weinstein &amp; M. Berger, Weinstein\u2019s Evidence \u00a7 609[01] (1990). Thus, the legislative history of Fed.R.Evid. 609 clearly argues in favor of the district court\u2019s ruling in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-13\"><em>Piassick </em>and <em>Mickler, </em>cited by the Mitch-ells, are therefore not controlling because they were decided before the adoption of the Federal Rules. The Mitchells also rely on a third case, <em>United States v. Morrow, </em>537 F.2d 120 (5th Cir.1976). But <em>Morrow </em>involved the introduction of a conviction based on a <em>nolo contendere </em>plea as substantive evidence of <em>intent, </em>presumably under Fed.R.Evid. 404(b), and not for impeachment purposes under Fed.R.Evid. 609. Thus, to the extent that <em>Morrow </em>implied that <em>Piassick </em>and <em>Mickler </em>survived the adoption of the Federal Rules, the suggestion was dicta only.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Williams, </em>642 F.2d 136 (5th Cir.1981), by contrast, expressly upheld the admission of a conviction based on a <em>nolo contendere </em>plea for impeachment purposes under Fed. R.Evid. 609.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-14\">The Mitchells attempt to distinguish <em>Williams </em>because the prior conviction in that case was unrelated to the case at bar. However, this court expressly rejected such a distinction in <em>Piassick:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-15\">[A <em>nolo contendere </em>plea] is, to be sure, a tacit confession of guilt, but solely for the purpose of the case in which it is entered. If it cannot be used in another case based on the same facts it would seem to follow, a fortiori, that it could not be used to collateral purposes in a case founded upon unrelated facts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-16\"><em>Piassick, </em>253 F.2d at 661. We therefore reject the distinction and uphold the admission of Gaylon Mitchells\u2019 four prior convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-17\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b164-8\">. The Fourth Circuit, the only court to have expressly decided the issue, looks to the legal documents creating the property interest in defining a \"tract\u201d of land. <em>See Santoro, </em>866 F.2d at 1543; <em>Reynolds, </em>856 F.2d at 676-77. Without deciding the issue, the Second Circuit stated in <em>United States v. Property at 4492 S. Livonia Rd., </em>889 F.2d 1258, 1270 (2nd Cir.1989), that it is also possible \"to construe 'any lot or tract\u2019 to refer to real estate of the size usually associated with a lot or tract of fairly limited acreage, rather than whatever land is encompassed within the deed by which the owner acquired title.\u201d There is some controversy between the Mitch-ells and the government as to whether, under the <em>Reynolds </em>definition, the Sonny Mitchell Center contains eight or three tracts of land. It might also be said to contain only one tract, since the Mitchells acquired all of the property encompassed by the Center in a single deed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b165-10\">. <em>Noell v. Bensinger, </em>586 F.2d 554, 556 (5th Cir. 1978), also described <em>Piassick </em>as the rule of this circuit, but like <em>Morrow, </em>the suggestion was in dicta only.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
