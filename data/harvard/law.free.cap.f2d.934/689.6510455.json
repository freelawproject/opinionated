Bercier, M.D., appeals from a federal district court ruling that $50,000 of his debt to Bank of Louisiana is nondis-chargeable. The district court reversed the bankruptcy court\u2019s prior ruling that the debt was, in fact, dischargeable. For the reasons set forth below, we reverse the ruling of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1215-27\">I. <em>Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1215-28\">Maurice L. Bercier, M.D. (Bercier) owned a fifty percent interest in Southeast Corn-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>puted Tomography (S.E.C.T.). The Bank of Louisiana (BOL), formerly Fidelity Bank &amp; Trust Company of Slidell, loaned $120,000 to S.E.C.T. in March, 1984. As collateral for the loan, Bercier placed a second mortgage on his office condominium valued at $60,000 and pledged his office accounts receivables valued at $40,000 and a $50,000 Nuveen Municipal Bond.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At the time of the loan, Bercier could not find the bond, but he agreed to deliver it to BOL when he located it. Later, at BOL\u2019s request, Bercier attempted to locate the bond several times, to no avail.</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-3\">On July 20, 1985, S.E.C.T. defaulted on its note payments. BOL then foreclosed on the mortgage. The bank filed suit in state court seeking a deficiency judgment against Bercier. Bercier located the bond in October, 1985, having misplaced it in one of his patient\u2019s files. Bercier liquidated the bond on November 8, 1985, and placed the proceeds in an escrow account pending the outcome of settlement negotiations with BOL. After the negotiations failed but before resolution of the state court suit, Bercier spent the proceeds from the bond for his living expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-4\">The bank obtained a deficiency judgment in state court against Bercier for $48,-044.17 plus interest. Bercier then filed a bankruptcy petition under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 701 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1216-5\">Shortly after Bercier\u2019s Chapter 7 filing, BOL filed a complaint under \u00a7 523(a)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> seeking to have its deficiency judgment against Bercier held to be nondischargeable based on misrepresentations allegedly made by Bercier in connection with the pledge of the bond. The bankruptcy judge, after a bench trial, found that the pledge of the bond was an accessory contract to secure the performance of another obligation. The court also found that the plaintiff, BOL, had the burden of proving the primary obligation on the debt for which the pledge was given. BOL failed to sustain its burden of proof, according to the bankruptcy court, because the judgment did not recognize the pledge as being collateral for the debt sued on. The court ruled that BOL\u2019s claim for the $50,000 bond was discharged, and that BOL owed Bercier interest, attorney\u2019s fees, and court costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-10\">The bankruptcy court further found, \u201cin the event that this matter is appealed,\u201d that Bercier did not misrepresent any facts at the time the debt was purportedly entered; that he had lost the bond; that the validity of the pledge between pledgor and pledgee did not depend upon delivery; and that Bercier pledged the entire bond, not merely $20,000, and was under a duty to deliver it or a substitute. Finally, assuming that there was a note for which the pledge was given, the bankruptcy court found that Bercier\u2019s use of the bond proceeds constituted conversion and \u201cwould have been grounds\u201d for declaring the $50,-000 nondischargeable. No provision of the Bankruptcy Code was cited in the bankruptcy court\u2019s reasons for judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-11\">BOL appealed the bankruptcy court\u2019s decision to the district court. At this point, BOL changed horses and based its brief on appeal on \u00a7 523(a)(6) of the Bankruptcy Code,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> not on \u00a7 523(a)(2). Perhaps BOL, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>after considering the bankruptcy court\u2019s fact findings \u2018for the purpose of appeal\u2019 and Bercier\u2019s pretrial memorandum explaining why \u00a7 523(a)(2) does not apply to those facts, decided to pursue another more promising route to victory at the appellate level. BOL\u2019s decision to base its brief to the district court on \u00a7 523(a)(6) is understandable in light of the bankruptcy court\u2019s findings that the pledge was valid, that Bercier\u2019s use of the proceeds constituted conversion, and that conversion would be grounds for declaring the $50,000 non-dischargeable. These findings are common in \u00a7 523(a)(6) cases. <em>See In re Valentine, </em>104 B.R. 67, 70 (Bankr.S.D.Ind.1988) (\u201c[cjonversion of another\u2019s property will give rise to a nondischargeable debt under 523(a)(6) if the conversion is willful and malicious\u201d); 3 Collier on Bankruptcy, 15th ed., \u00a7 523.16 (\u201cThe conversion of another\u2019s property without his knowledge or consent, done intentionally and without justification and excuse, to the other\u2019s injury, is a willful and malicious injury within the meaning of the exception.\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The problem with the newly-embraced route is that BOL\u2019s complaint in the bankruptcy proceedings is specifically predicated on \u00a7 523(a)(2) and does not even mention \u00a7 523(a)(6), and there is nothing in the bankruptcy court record suggesting that this was anything other than a \u00a7 523(a)(2) case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1217-4\">The district court accepted BOL\u2019s invitation to analyze this case under \u00a7 523(a)(6) and, relying on \u00a7 523(a)(6), reversed the decision of the bankruptcy court, declaring BOL\u2019s claim against Bercier to be nondis-chargeable, with court costs to be paid by Bercier. The district court, reviewing the record as a whole, held that BOL \u201cdid sustain its burden of proving that the bond was pledged to secure the note and that the judgment was based upon the defaulted note.\u201d To the extent that this holding overturned the bankruptcy court\u2019s conclusion that BOL had failed to prove the primary obligation on the debt for which the pledge was given, this holding is not challenged on appeal. The district court also held that \u201cBercier\u2019s use of the proceeds of the bond constituted an intentional act ... which caused willful and malicious injury\u201d to BOL. The district court agreed with the bankruptcy court that the spending of the proceeds constituted conversion. Accordingly, the district court held that the $50,000 debt was nondischargeable under \u00a7 523(a)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b1217-9\">II. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1217-10\">\u201cThis court reviews the bankruptcy court\u2019s findings of fact under the clearly erroneous standard, but the bankruptcy court\u2019s conclusions of law are subject to <em>de novo </em>review.\u201d <em>Matter of Consolidated Bancshares, Inc., </em>785 F.2d 1249, 1252 (5th Cir.1986) (citations omitted). \u201cThus we will affirm the bankruptcy court\u2019s findings unless \u2018on the entire evidence, [this court is] left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u2019 \u201d <em>In the Matter of Sutton, </em>904 F.2d 327, 329 (5th Cir.1990) (quoting <em>United States v. United States Gypsum Co., </em>333 U.S. 364, 395, 68 S.Ct. 525, 541, 92 L.Ed. 746 (1948)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1217-11\">III. <em>Discussion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1217-12\">As suggested by the factual scenario set forth above, the procedural history of the case is the key to the decision of this appeal. This case was originally filed under \u00a7 523(a)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code. BOL alleged, in its complaint in the bankruptcy proceedings, that throughout its dealing with Bercier, \u201cBercier continued to represent to BOL <em>that the bond was missing and therefore could not be handed over to </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number><em>the Bank, </em>although in truth and fact, this was a misrepresentation of fact to BOL by Dr. Bercier_\u201d BOL\u2019s complaint also treated Bercier\u2019s promise to deliver the bond as a representation and simply alleged that he \u201cfailed to live up to his representation[ ].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1218-6\">Turning to the relevant portion of \u00a7 523(a)(2), a debt for money or an extension, renewal or refinancing of credit is nondischargeable under this section of the Code to the extent it is obtained by false pretenses, a false representation or actual fraud. In order for Bercier\u2019s representation to be a false representation or false pretense under \u00a7 523(a)(2), the \u201cfalse representations and false pretenses [must] encompass statements that falsely purport to depict <em>current or past facts. </em>[A debtor\u2019s] promise ... related to [a] <em>future action </em>[which does] not purport to depict current or past fact ... therefore cannot be defined as a <em>false representation or a false pretense.\u201d In re Roeder, </em>61 B.R. 179, 181 (Bankr.W.D.Ky.1986) (quoting <em>In re Todd, </em>34 B.R. 633, 635 (Bankr.W.D.Ky.1983)). <em>See </em>3 Collier on Bankruptcy 15th Ed., \u00a7 523.08[4] (\u201cA mere promise to be executed in the future is not sufficient to make a debt nondischargeable, even though there is no excuse for the subsequent breach.\u201d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The actual fraud component of \u00a7 523(a)(2), insofar as it is relevant here, is explained by the <em>Roeder </em>court as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AKcp\">a cause of action for fraud will exist under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A) when a debtor makes promises of future action which, <em>at the time they were made, </em>he had no intention of fulfilling. In order to succeed on this legal theory, the objecting party must prove that: (1) the debtor made representations; (2) at the time they were made the debtor knew they were false; (3) the debtor made the representations with the intention and purpose to deceive the creditor; (4) that the creditor relied on such representations; and (5) that the creditor sustained losses as a proximate result of the representations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1218-10\"><em>Roeder, </em>61 B.R. at 181.</p>\n<p id=\"b1218-11\">The bankruptcy court and the district court both expressly found that Bercier did not misrepresent any facts when the debt was entered into. In the light of the way this case was pleaded and tried, we read these findings as encompassing the conclusion that Bercier\u2019s representation that he would deliver the bond was truthful when made. These findings are not clearly erroneous and are not challenged on appeal to this court. With these unchallenged fact findings, BOL could not establish that Ber-cier\u2019s debt is nondischargeable under \u00a7 523(a)(2) because at the time the debt was entered into, Bercier did not make a false representation of a current or past fact when he said the bond was lost or a false representation or promise when he said that he would furnish it when he found it, or duplicate it if he could not find it. Thus in applying the findings of the bankruptcy court, as accepted by the district court, we hold that BOL failed to establish that Bercier\u2019s debt was nondis-chargeable under \u00a7 523(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1218-12\">We now turn to BOL\u2019s \u201cclaim\u201d under \u00a7 523(a)(6), argued for the first time in its appellate brief to the district court. Under Rule 4007(c) of the Bankruptcy Code, \u201c[a] complaint to determine the discharge-ability of any debt pursuant to \u00a7 523(c) of the Code shall be filed not later than 60 days following the first date set for the meeting of creditors held pursuant to \u00a7 341(a).\u201d The Advisory Committee Note further explains that Rule 4007(c) imposes \u201ca deadline for filing complaints to determine the issue of dischargeability of debts set out in \u00a7 523(a)(2), (4) or (6) of the Code. The bankruptcy court has exclusive jurisdiction to determine dischargeability of these debts. If a complaint is not timely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>filed, the debt is discharged.\u201d Bankr. Rule 4007 advisory committee\u2019s note.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1219-4\">In the instant case, the meeting of creditors pursuant to \u00a7 341(a) took place on February 6, 1989, and BOL\u2019s complaint under \u00a7 523(a)(2) was timely filed on March 1, 1989. However, BOL\u2019s arguments based on \u00a7 523(a)(6) were first made on October 9, 1990, and then not in a pleading but in an appellate brief. In allowing BOL to prevail in its quest to have the judgment against Bercier held nondischargeable based on a provision of the Code not asserted in the complaint or litigated at trial, the district court in effect subverted the purpose of Bankruptcy Rule 4007(c) to require complaints for dischargeability under, <em>inter alia, </em>\u00a7 523(a)(6) to be filed within sixty days after the \u00a7 341(a) creditors\u2019 meeting.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In addition, \u00a7 523(a)(6) requires a finding by the trier of fact of willful and malicious injury by the debtor, a finding not expressly made here by the bankruptcy court because BOL was proceeding under an entirely different section of the Bankruptcy Code at trial. We therefore decline the parties\u2019 invitation to decide whether Bercier\u2019s debt was dischargeable under \u00a7 523(a)(6) by analyzing whether Bercier perfected his pledge of the bond or converted BOL\u2019s property under Louisiana law. The district court erred in allowing BOL to switch horses in midstream by changing this \u00a7 523(a)(2) case into a \u00a7 523(a)(6) case at the appellate stage.</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-5\">IV. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1219-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the decision of the district court and hold, based on the bankruptcy court\u2019s findings of fact, that BOL failed to establish that Ber-cier\u2019s $50,000 debt is nondischargeable under \u00a7 523(a)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-7\">REVERSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1216-6\">. According to Bercier\u2019s testimony before the bankruptcy court, during his negotiations with BOL, Bercier stated that he wanted only $20,000 of the bond to serve as collateral. This would mean the total value of the collateral would equal the total amount of the loan \u2014 $120,000. Bercier\u2019s testimony is supported by some of the witnesses; others simply did not recall. If, in fact, these were Bercier\u2019s intentions, they were never reduced to writing, and the bankruptcy court found the entire $50,000 bond to be collateral. This finding, accepted by the district court, is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1216-7\">. \u00a7 523(a)(2) states, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1216-12\">(a) A discharge under section 727, 1141, 1228(a), 1228(b), or 1328(b) of this title does not discharge an individual debtor from any debt\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1216-13\">(2) for money, property, services, or an extension, renewal, or refinancing of credit, to the extent obtained by\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1216-14\">(A) false pretenses, a false representation, or actual fraud, other than a statement reflecting the debtor's or an insider's financial condition....</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1216-15\">.11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(6) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1216-16\">(a) A discharge under section 727, 1141, 1228(a), 1228(b), or 1328(b) of this title does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>not discharge an individual debtor from any debt\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAJpZ\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1217-6\">(6) for willful and malicious injury by the debtor to another entity or to the property of another entity....</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1217-7\">. We note that the testimony before the bankruptcy court regarding whether Bercier's pledge of the bond was valid and why he liquidated the bond and spent the proceeds when he did is germane to BOL\u2019s \u00a7 523(a)(2) claim that Bercier made a misrepresentation of fact to the bank. Moreover, the liquidation of the bond and the spending of the proceeds are also germane to BOL\u2019s \u00a7 523(a)(2) claim because, in its complaint, BOL asked for interest on the $50,000 \"from the date of conversion and liquidation of the bond.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1218-7\">. <em>See also In re Boese, </em>8 B.R. 660, 662 (Bankr.D.S.D.1981) (\"In order to prevail under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A), a creditor must prove that a debtor knowingly and fraudulently made false representations to the creditor in order to obtain the creditor\u2019s money. Subsequent conduct contrary to a former representation by debtor does not necessarily establish the original representation to have been false.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1219-9\">. This court has applied Bankr. Rule 4007(c) strictly. <em>See In the Matter of Sam, </em>894 F.2d 778, 781 (5th Cir.1990) (one purpose of Rule 4007(c) to promote expeditious and efficient administration of bankruptcy cases by assuring parties that within 60 days they know which debts subject to an exception to discharge); <em>In the Matter of Compton, </em>891 F.2d 1180, 1185 (5th Cir.1990) (\"Rule 4007 ... places a heavy burden on the creditor to protect his rights.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1219-10\">. We do not suggest that an amended complaint adding a ground of challenge to the discharge-ability of a particular debt would not relate back, for purposes of Bankruptcy Rule 4007(c), to the time of filing of the same creditor\u2019s original complaint challenging the dischargeability of the identical debt. Courts have applied Fed.
