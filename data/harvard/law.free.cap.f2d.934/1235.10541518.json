For the reasons that follow, we vacate appellant\u2019s sentence and remand the case to the district court for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-4\">The appellant was charged, by indictment, with two section 2113(a) offenses, both of which took place in Gainesville, Florida: the robbery of a bank on December 21,1988 (count one), and the robbery of a federal credit union on December 24, 1988 (count two). After receiving discovery from the Government, the appellant pled guilty to the count two offense, pursuant to a plea agreement that called for the Government to dismiss the count one charge at sentencing, and the district court instructed its probation service to prepare a presentence investigation (PSI) report.</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-5\">When the case came on for sentencing, the district court first heard the appellant\u2019s objections to the PSI report (the Government had none), and resolved them.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Next, the court asked the appellant\u2019s attorney if the appellant wished to address the court. The attorney replied that the appellant had nothing to say. The court then handed down its sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-6\">The maximum penalty the court could impose for appellant\u2019s violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a) is the penalty specified in that statute: a fine of \u201cnot more than $5,000 or imprison[ment for] not more than twenty years, or both.\u201d The Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, Pub.L. No. 98-473, 98 Stat. 1987 (codified as amended in scattered sections of 18 and 28 U.S.C.), required the district court to consider the following factors, among others:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1308-7\">(1) the nature and circumstances of the offense [of which the defendant had been convicted] and the history and characteristics of the defendant;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1308-9\">(2) the need for the sentence imposed\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1308-10\">(A) to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1308-11\">(B) to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1308-12\">(C) to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1308-13\">(D) to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training, medical care, or other correctional treatment in the most effective manner;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1308-14\">(4) the kinds of sentence and the sentencing range established for the applicable category of offense committed by the applicable category of defendant as set forth in the guidelines that are issued by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(a)(1) and that are in effect on the date the defendant is sentenced;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1308-15\">(5) any pertinent policy statement issued by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(a)(2) that is in effect on the date the defendant is sentenced;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1308-16\">(6) the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1308-17\">(7) the need to provide restitution to any victims of the offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1308-18\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (1988). According to the PSI report, the Sentencing Commission\u2019s Guidelines prescribed a sentence of imprisonment for the appellant\u2019s section 2113(a) offense (a level 17 offense) and for a person in appellant\u2019s \u201ccriminal history category,\u201d III, of not less than thirty months and not more than thirty-seven <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1237\">*1237</page-number>months. <em>See </em>Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7\u00a7 2B3.1(a), (b)(1), 3E1.1, 4A1.1 (November 1, 1989).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, the Guidelines instructed the district court to sentence appellant to prison for a term within this thirty-to-thirty-seven-month range.</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-4\">The district court, however, determined, pursuant to Guidelines \u00a7 4A1.3 (November 1, 1987), that appellant\u2019s criminal history category did not adequately reflect the seriousness of his past criminal conduct and, thus, departed upward from the prescribed Guideline range.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Principally, the court thought that the bank robbery for which the Government had agreed not to prosecute appellant (count one of appellant\u2019s indictment) demonstrated the inadequacy of appellant\u2019s criminal history category.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In departing, the court sentenced appellant as if he had been convicted of a level 21 offense; the court did not adjust his criminal history category (III). This combination (level 21 offense, criminal history category III) made appellant subject to forty-six to fifty-seven months imprisonment; the court sentenced appellant to fifty-seven months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-5\">On appeal, appellant argues that the district court, in departing upward, erred in its application of section 4A1.3. We agree. This court has previously noted that the Guidelines provide specific guidance, either \u201cby analogy or by other numerical or nonnumerical suggestions,\u201d for district courts to use, in some cases, when departing from the prescribed Guideline range. <em>United States v. Fayette, </em>895 F.2d 1375, 1377 (11th Cir.1990) (quoting Guidelines ch. 1, pt. A, introduction 4(b) (Nov. 1989)). \u201cDeparture from the otherwise applicable criminal history category, pursuant to Guidelines \u00a7 4A1.3, is an example of a guided departure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As the Guidelines explain, a district court, when departing under this section, should \u201cuse, as a reference, the guideline range for a defendant with a higher or lower criminal history category, as applicable.\u201d Guidelines \u00a7 4A1.3. For example,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1309-9\">if the court concludes that the defendant\u2019s criminal history category of III significantly under-represents the seriousness of the defendant\u2019s criminal history, and that the seriousness of the defendant\u2019s criminal history most closely resembles that of most defendants with a Category IV criminal history, the court should look to the guideline range specified for a defendant with a Category IV criminal history to guide its departure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1309-10\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-11\">In following this procedure, then, district courts, in departing upward, must look to the next highest criminal history category and determine, taking into account the factors allowed by section 4A1.3, whether that category more accurately reflects the defendant\u2019s criminal history.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> If the court determines that the defendant\u2019s criminal history fits that category,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> then the court must sentence the defendant within the range called for by the Guidelines, given this new criminal history category and the offense level of the crime for which the defendant is being sentenced. If, on the other hand, the court decides that this new category is still inadequate to reflect the defendant\u2019s criminal history, the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1238\">*1238</page-number>must look to the next highest category and repeat its inquiry.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1310-4\">In the present case, the district court failed to follow this procedure. The court, after concluding that category III inadequately reflected appellant\u2019s criminal history, simply, and inexplicably, increased appellant\u2019s <em>offense level </em>and sentenced him accordingly. Because the district court failed to follow the procedure required by the Guidelines, we VACATE appellant\u2019s sentence and REMAND this case to the district court so that it can properly fashion appellant\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-5\">IT IS SO ORDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1308-8\">. The appellant takes this appeal pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a) (1988), which provides, in pertinent part, for the appellate review of a sentence if the sentence was imposed \"in violation of law,\u201d or \"as a result of an incorrect application of the [United States Sentencing Commission\u2019s] sentencing guidelines,\" or if the sentence provides for a term of imprisonment that is \u201cgreater than the [term] specified in the applicable guideline range.\u201d In this case, as we explain <em>infra, </em>the appellant contends that the district court, in fashioning his sentence, misapplied the guidelines and/or imposed a prison term greater than the term authorized by the applicable guideline range.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1308-20\">. Neither the appellant's objections nor the court's resolution of them are relevant to the issues raised in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1309-6\">. The PSI relied on the Guidelines in effect at the time appellant was sentenced. The sentencing guidelines also prescribed, in addition to a term of imprisonment, the imposition of a fine and, if appropriate, restitution. These guidelines are not relevant to the issues before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1309-7\">. While the district court did not explicitly state that it was relying on Guidelines \u00a7 4A1.3 in departing upward on appellant\u2019s sentence, the record demonstrates that the district court justified its upward departure with its perception that appellant's criminal history category inaccurately reflected appellant\u2019s past criminal conduct.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1309-12\">. A departure for such reason is proper under Guidelines \u00a7 4A1.3(e), which allows a court to depart from the otherwise applicable guideline range because of \"prior similar adult criminal conduct not resulting in a criminal conviction.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1309-13\">. The procedure is substantially the same when the court intends to depart downward.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1309-14\">. The district court must share its findings with the defendant on the record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"Ab9\">. \u201cThe Commission contemplates that there may, on occasion, be a case of an egregious, serious criminal record in which even the guideline range for a Category VI criminal history is not adequate to reflect the seriousness of the defendant\u2019s criminal history. In such a case, a decision above the guideline range for a defendant with a Category VI criminal history may be warranted.\u201d Guidelines \u00a7 4A1.3. Note, however, that this does not hold true for downward departures; \"a departure below the lower limit of the guideline range for a Category I criminal history on the basis of the adequacy of criminal history cannot be appropriate.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
