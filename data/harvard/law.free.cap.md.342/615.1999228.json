The issue before us concerns the standard which a court should apply in considering a petition to resign as guardian of the person of a minor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-4\">Carl and Mavis Bauer were married on August 21,1979. At the time, Mavis had three children from a previous marriage, and Carl had one. Steven Fountain is Mavis\u2019s son from her prior marriage. Steven married Annie Marie in 1979 in North Carolina, and their first child, James Ellis Fountain, was born in December 1979.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-5\">In 1981, Steven, Annie Marie, and James Ellis Fountain moved to Maryland. Steven and Annie Marie divorced in early 1982, and Annie Marie married John Keith Geiger. Later in 1982, Annie Marie and John Keith Geiger had a son who was initially named Charles Keith Geiger and subsequently named Charles Keith Fountain.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Sometime later, Annie Marie and John Keith Geiger apparently separated, and Annie Marie and Steven apparently resumed co-habitation. On March 12, 1984, Annie Marie and Steven had their second child together, Daniel Carl Fountain. Shortly thereafter, Annie Marie moved back to North Carolina, leaving all three boys in Steven\u2019s custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-6\">On November 19, 1985, Steven filed in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County a complaint for custody of his two sons, James and Daniel, as well as for custody of Charles Keith Geiger. Both Annie Marie, who lived in North Carolina, and Charles\u2019s natural father, John Keith Geiger, who still resided in Maryland, signed documents consenting to the appointment of Steven \u201cas guardian and legal custodian\u201d of the boys. The circuit court ordered that Steven be granted custody of all three boys.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-7\">About three years later, in early 1989, Carl and Mavis filed three virtually identical petitions in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County requesting that the circuit court name them guardians of the persons of the three children, James, Charles and Daniel. Each of the petitions stated that Carl and Mavis sought \u201cthe appointment of a guardian of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>person of the minor so that the minor can be covered under Petitioners\u2019 health insurance policy, provide schooling for the child and perform all other acts necessary to the raising of the child.\u201d The petitions indicated that the three boys had resided with Mavis and Carl for most of the time since 1984. Each petition also stated that Carl and Mavis \u201care fully able to support the minor child. In addition, Steven Anthony Fountain has agreed to pay the Petitioners the sum of One Hundred Dollars ($100.00) per month as child support.\u201d Steven, John Keith Geiger who had moved to Pennsylvania, and Annie Marie who continued to reside in North Carolina and had apparently remarried, all signed documents consenting to the appointment of Carl and Mavis as guardians for the boys. On June 16, 1989, the Circuit Court for Montgomery County appointed Carl Bauer and Mavis Bauer as guardians of the person for all three boys.</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-4\">According to Mavis, Carl moved out of the family home on May 9,1994. Mavis filed in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, on July 19, 1994, a complaint which, as amended, sought a limited divorce from Carl on the ground of abandonment, alimony, and child support. That action is presently pending in the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-5\">On October 5, 1994, Carl instituted the present action by filing in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County a petition to resign as co-guardian of James, Charles and Daniel. Carl submitted his petition to resign pursuant to Maryland Code (1974, 1991 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7\u00a7 13-220 and 221 of the Estates and Trusts Article and Maryland Rule V81. In his petition, Carl advised the circuit court that his resignation as co-guardian would not terminate the guardianship; instead, it would leave Mavis as the sole guardian. Mavis filed an opposition to Carl\u2019s petition to resign, and thereafter both sides filed memoranda, affidavits, and answers to interrogatories.</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-6\">In opposing Carl\u2019s petition, Mavis pointed out that the statutes invoked by Carl, \u00a7\u00a7 13-220 and 221 of the Estates and Trusts Article, related to guardians of property, and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>\u00a7 13-702 of the Estates and Trust Article was the statute relating to guardians of the person of minors. Mavis further asserted that it was not in the best interests of the minor children to allow Carl Bauer to resign as co-guardian. She specifically contended that \u201cCarl asked for, and was granted, full parental authority and responsibility for all three children [and the] Court cannot allow him to simply walk away from his responsibilities and obligations,\u201d that \u201cby agreement of the natural parents, all three children have spent the majority of their lives with, and have been raised and supported by, Mavis and Carl,\u201d that Carl \u201cdesired that he and Mavis become guardians of the children in order to provide them with the support, stability and security they needed,\u201d that Carl had agreed in the guardianship petition \u201cto provide schooling for the children and perform all other acts necessary to the raising of the children,\u201d that Carl \u201cpromised\u201d that he and Mavis were \u201cfully able to support\u201d the children, that the children considered Carl as their father, that Carl had been acting as their father, taking them to \u201cfather-son prayer breakfasts,\u201d attending parent-teacher conferences, etc., and that Carl \u201coften reassured [the children] that he would always \u2018be there\u2019 for them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-4\">Mavis argued that, in light of all of the circumstances, Carl had a duty to support the three boys based on \u201cequitable estoppel and contract.\u201d Mavis stated that Carl had induced the children, their natural parents, and Mavis to rely upon his \u201crepresentations that he would provide for their support and would \u2018always be there for the children.\u2019 \u201d Mavis\u2019s position was that \u201cCarl Bauer must not be allowed to breach his agreement to support the children\u201d by being permitted to resign as co-guardian.</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-5\">In reply, Carl disputed several of Mavis\u2019s factual assertions, and denied that he had agreed to or assumed the role of father to the three boys. Carl asserted that Steven had lived with Carl, Mavis and the children during a majority of the time, and that Steven had performed the role of parent to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>children until he became incarcerated in 1993.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Carl claimed that the \u201ccumulative stress of Mavis\u2019s persistent pressure and efforts to support her adult children and grandchildren,\u201d and the \u201cstress\u201d brought on by \u201cSteven\u2019s murder of his girlfriend of five years,\u201d have left Carl with \u201csevere depression\u201d for which he was receiving psychiatric treatment and which \u201chas resulted in [Carl\u2019s] inability to function as a guardian.\u201d Carl also pointed out that he no longer resided in the family home with the children, that he has \u201cbeen forced to avoid the ... house because of Mavis\u2019s aggressive behavior and emotional abuse,\u201d and that he lived alone in an apartment. Finally, Carl denied that he had contractually undertaken to support the children or that he had a duty to support them under principles of equitable estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-4\">Neither side filed an express motion for summary judgment, although in one of her memoranda Mavis asserted that Carl\u2019s \u201cPetition To Resign As Guardian should be treated as a Motion For Summary Judgment and should be denied.\u201d When the case was called for hearing in the circuit court, although Mavis\u2019s counsel had brought numerous witnesses for a full evidentiary trial on the disputed factual issues, her counsel nevertheless suggested to the court that \u201cit is my position, after continuing to reflect on the matter, that it is a question of law.\u201d The court agreed, decided to resolve the matter as a summary judgment proceeding, and neither side objected.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1043-5\">During the argument before the circuit court, counsel for Mavis agreed with the court\u2019s comment that, ordinarily, the question of whether one should remain as guardian of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>person of a minor, and the question of whether one has a duty to support the minor, were entirely separate and distinct issues, and that \u201cbeing appointed as a guardian does not carry with it the duty of support in and of itself.\u201d Counsel for Mavis also did not disagree that, except for the alleged duty of support, the petition to resign should be granted. Nevertheless, Mavis\u2019s position was that, under the circumstances here, Carl had a duty to support the three children under principles of contract and/or equitable estoppel, and that this assumption of the duty to support the minors warranted a denial of the petition in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-4\">The trial judge agreed that the issue before the court was \u201cwhether or not [Carl] has any duty of support.\u201d The judge then held, based on the facts relied upon by Mavis, that Carl had no duty to support the children under principles of contract or equitable estoppel. The court concluded that, because \u201cthere is, in the court\u2019s opinion, no legal basis to require him to support these children,\u201d the court \u201cwill grant the request of Carl Bauer to resign as co-guardian of these three children.\u201d Subsequently the court signed an order which, after referring to the documents and arguments by the parties, granted the petition to resign as co-guardian.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-5\">Mavis appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, and, prior to any further proceedings in that court, we issued a writ of certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-6\">Both sides, in their briefs and oral arguments before this Court, deal entirely with the question of whether Carl had a duty to support the three boys. Mavis argues that Carl had a duty to support the children under principles of \u201cequitable estoppel\u201d and, alternatively, that he \u201cis contractually obligated to continue supporting the minor children.\u201d For this reason, according to Mavis, the circuit court\u2019s order should be reversed. Carl argues that the circuit court correctly held that he had no duty of support, and that, therefore, the order should be affirmed. Carl principally relies upon this Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Knill v. Knill, </em>306 Md. 527, 510 A.2d 546 (1986). Both sides construe the circuit court\u2019s order as an adjudication <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>of the support issue. According to counsel, Carl has argued in the pending divorce action that the circuit court\u2019s order in this case is preclusive with regard to the child support issue raised in the divorce action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-6\">The provisions of the Estates and Trusts Article of the Maryland Code governing guardianships separately classify guardians of property and guardians of the person. Title 13, subtitle 2, consisting of sections 13-201 through 13-222, which include the provisions initially relied on in Carl\u2019s petition to resign, relate to guardians of property. The record discloses that the three wards had no assets and that Carl was appointed only as co-guardian of their persons. Therefore, \u00a7\u00a7 13-201 through 13-222 are not directly applicable to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-7\">Title 13, subtitle 7, of the Estates and Trusts Article, consisting of \u00a7\u00a7 13-701 through 13-710, entitled \u201cGuardian of the Person,\u201d contains the statutory provisions relating to guardians of the person. Section 13-701 deals with the testamentary appointment of a guardian, and \u00a7\u00a7 13-704 through 13-710 concern guardians of disabled persons; consequently, these sections do not apply here. <em>Wentzel v. Montgomery Gen. Hosp., </em>293 Md. 685, 700-701, 447 A.2d 1244, 1252-1253 (1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. 1147, 103 S.Ct. 790, 74 L.Ed.2d 995 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-8\">The pertinent statutory section is \u00a7 13-702, which provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1045-9\">\u201c \u00a7 13-702. Court appointment of guardian of a minor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1045-10\">(a) <em>General </em>rule.\u2014If neither parent is serving as guardian of the person and no testamentary appointment has been made, on petition by any person interested in the welfare of the minor, and after notice and hearing, the court may appoint a guardian of the person of an unmarried minor. If the minor has attained his 14th birthday, and if the person otherwise is qualified, the court shall appoint a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>person designated by the minor, unless the decision is not in the best interests of the minor. This section may not be construed to require court appointment of a guardian of the person of a minor if there is no good reason, such as a dispute, for a court appointment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1046-4\">(b) <em>Venue and procedure. </em>Venue in proceedings under this subtitle shall be as prescribed by the Maryland Rules. The contents of the petition and the manner of giving notice of the hearing on the petition shall be as prescribed by Maryland Rules.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1046-5\">Section 13-702 contains no language expressly permitting a resignation by a guardian of the person. In fact, \u00a7 13-702 is very general, and specifically deals with only a few matters in connection with the appointment of a guardian of the person of a minor. In <em>Wentzel v. Montgomery Gen. Hosp., supra, </em>293 Md. at 701-702, 447 A.2d at 1252, Chief Judge Murphy for the Court explained the legislative purpose underlying \u00a7 13-702 as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1046-6\">\u201cIn enacting \u00a7 13-702, expressly recognizing the authority of circuit courts to appoint a guardian of the person of a minor, but without delineating the guardian\u2019s powers and duties, the legislature intended that circuit courts would exercise their inherent equitable jurisdiction over guardianship matters pertaining to minors, adopting standards with respect thereto as would be consistent with and in furtherance of the incompetent ward\u2019s best interests.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AuD\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1046-7\">\u201cIt is a fundamental common law concept that the jurisdiction of courts of equity over such persons is plenary so as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>afford whatever relief may be necessary to protect the [minor\u2019s] best interests.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1047-4\">Thus, with respect to the many issues which may come before a court in connection with a guardianship under \u00a7 13-702, the general overall standard guiding the court is the best interests of the minor. <em>See also, e.g., Sudler v. Sudler, </em>121 Md. 46, 56, 88 A. 26, 30 (1913) (\u201cthe best interests of [the] ward\u201d is the governing standard); <em>Compton v. Compton, </em>2 Gill 241 (1844) (\u201cinterests ... of the infant\u201d guide a court in appointing a guardian).</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-6\">Although this Court has not previously dealt with a request to resign as a guardian of the person of a minor, the historical evolution of the issue, culminating in decisions by courts'in our sister states, confirms that a petition to resign as guardian should be granted if it is in the best interests of the minor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-7\">In England, the general rule at an earlier period of the common law was that guardians could not resign. <em>Spencer v. Chesterfield, </em>27 Eng. Rep. 94, 94-95 (Ch. 1752); <em>Shaftsbury v. Shaftsbury, </em>25 Eng. Rep. 121, 124 (Ch. 1725); <em>Macpherson On Infants </em>at 26-27, 98 (1843); 1 Schouler, <em>Domestic Relations, </em>\u00a7 854 (6th ed. 1921). This rule was especially strict for guardians in socage.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> As the court explained in <em>Shaftsbury v. Shaftsbury, supra, </em>25 Eng. Rep. at 124, \u201cthe Guardian in Socage has no Interest of Profit; it is an Interest of Honour, and for the Honour of the Family committed to his next of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>Kin, and therefore is inherent to the Blood, and can\u2019t be assignable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-4\">The rule that guardians could not resign was apparently less rigid when applied to testamentary guardians as long as special circumstances existed. In <em>Spencer v. Chesterfield, supra, </em>27 Eng. Rep. at 95, the Lord Chancellor initially ruled against a petition to resign, announcing that testamentary guardians could not resign and that the court would compel the guardians to act. Upon reconsideration of a revised petition, this time submitted by the ward himself and with his mother\u2019s consent, the Lord Chancellor ruled that the guardians could resign because of the special circumstances of this case. In so ruling, the Lord Chancellor commented that \u201cin general he would not comply with such [a] petition [to resign], nor should this case be drawn into precedent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-5\">Schouler, in his treatise on Domestic Relations, explained why courts would not permit a guardian to resign at an earlier period of the common law (1 Schouler, <em>Domestic Relations, supra, </em>\u00a7 854 at 957-958):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1048-6\">\u201cThe office of a guardian was regarded as something so honorable at the common law that it could not be easily refused, much less resigned. Natural guardians, of necessity, could not resign. We have seen, in another connection, how far the natural guardian may practically surrender his children\u2019s custody, by allowing others to adopt them, by placing them in a charitable institution, and the like; which is the only sense in which this guardianship may be considered as voluntarily transferred. So guardians in socage, being designated by the law, could not in strictness resign; if they could shift their authority at all, it must have been by assignment. There is reason to believe that, before the statute of Marlbridge, they could assign, but only to the extent of placing the ward\u2019s body in custody of another. In later times, no assignment whatever has been permitted. For as Lord Commissioner Gilbert observed, guardianship in socage is an interest, not of profit, but of honor, committed to the next of kin, inherent in the blood; and therefore not assignable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1049-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>\u201cThe resignation of a testamentary guardian is not, as a rule, permitted.... Though this was [only the rule for] testamentary guardianship, we presume the rule to be equally strict, or nearly so, in case of chancery guardian.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1049-4\">In this country, the general rule developed that, in the absence of a statute authorizing the resignation of guardians, there is no absolute right to resign. <em>See, e.g., Wackerle v. People, </em>168 Ill. 250, 254, 48 N.E. 123, 124 (1897); <em>Young v. Lorain, </em>11 Ill. 624, 633 (1850); <em>Evans v. Johnson, </em>39 W.Va. 299, 306, 19 S.E. 623, 625 (1894). The majority of cases, however, take the position that a guardian\u2019s petition to resign should be granted if the resignation is for good cause or is in the best interests of the ward. <em>See, e.g., Wackerle v. People, supra, </em>168 Ill. at 254, 48 N.E. at 124; <em>Ex parte Crumb, </em>2 Johns Ch. 439 (N.Y.Ch.1817); <em>In re Wachter, </em>299 Pa. 153, 149 A. 315 (1930); <em>In re Dixon\u2019s Estate, </em>9 Pa. D. &amp; C. 79, 80 (1927), G.W. Field, <em>The Legal Relations of Infants, Parent and Child, and Guardian and Ward, </em>\u00a7 140 (1988). <em>See also Jain v. Priest, </em>30 Idaho 273, 283, 164 P. 364, 367 (1917); <em>Brown v. Huntsman, </em>32 Minn. 466, 467-468, 21 N.W. 555, 556 (1884); <em>Nicoll v. Trustees of Huntington, </em>1 Johns. Ch. 166, 173 (NY.Ch.1814). <em>But cf. Evans v. Johnson, supra, </em>39 W.Va. at 306, 19 S.E. at 625 (following the early English common law principle that ordinarily a guardian cannot resign).</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-5\">Moreover, the authorities, as well as common sense, support the position that ordinarily it is in the best interests of the minor to permit a guardian to resign when the guardian is unwilling to continue serving in that capacity. Commenting upon a case where the co-guardians submitted their resignations because they did not wish to supervise their ward who planned to travel abroad, one commentator noted: \u201cas it can never be for the infant\u2019s benefit to continue him in the care of a negligent or reluctant guardian, it is difficult to see how the court could avoid transferring the custody to another.\u201d <em>Macpherson On Infants, supra, </em>at 128. Another commentator observed (1 Schouler, <em>Domestic Relations, supra, </em>\u00a7 854 at 958-959):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1050-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>\u201c[N]umerous unforeseen emergencies may arise, so as to render the continuance of the trust improper; as if the guardian should become a confirmed invalid, or make himself obnoxious to the ward and his relations, or display a want of prudence in managing the estate not inconsistent with good intentions nor sufficiently gross to justify removing him. He might be fully aware of the advantage of a change to all parties concerned, and might desire to be relieved, provided he could withdraw with honor, and without submitting to a humiliating investigation of petty and insufficient grounds of complaint. This opportunity is afforded in allowing him to resign. So, too, the guardian\u2019s convenience, apart from all other considerations, might lead him to withdraw.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1050-4\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-5\">Although the authorities support the view that a court appointed guardian\u2019s petition to resign should be granted if there is good cause or if such action is in the best interests of the minor, the parties in the present case have cited no authority, and we are aware of none, holding or suggesting that acceptance of a court appointed guardian\u2019s resignation should depend upon whether the guardian has a duty to support the minor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-6\">When one is not a natural guardian of a minor <em>(i.e., </em>a parent), and is court appointed simply as a guardian of the person, there is no necessary correlation between the guardianship and the duty to support. One who is not a guardian may have contractually assumed the duty of child support. <em>See, e.g., Brown v. Brown, </em>287 Md. 273, 412 A.2d 396 (1980) (stepfather, upon divorce from child\u2019s mother, had by contract assumed the duty to pay a weekly sum for child support). On the other hand, one may be appointed guardian of the person of a minor simply for the purpose of making a particular type of decision for that minor. <em>See, e.g., Wentzel v. Montgomery Gen. Hosp., supra </em>(petition for appointment as guardians of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>mentally retarded minor for the purpose of consenting to a proposed surgical procedure).</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-4\">A court order appointing someone in Carl\u2019s position as guardian of the person of a minor does not, without more, impose a duty of support upon the guardian. On the other hand, under circumstances where a court appointed guardian of the person of a minor may have contractually assumed a duty to support the minor, an order merely allowing the appointee to resign as guardian, or an order removing the appointee as guardian, would not necessarily relieve the former guardian of any contractual obligations which he or she might have assumed with regard to child support.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-5\">In sum, the petition by a court appointed guardian of the person of a minor to resign as guardian should be granted if there is good cause or if the resignation is in the best interests of the minor.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Furthermore, it is ordinarily in the best interests of the minor to permit the resignation of a court appointed guardian who is no longer willing to serve in that capacity. Finally, whether a court appointed guardian of the person of a minor should be allowed to resign does not depend upon whether the guardian might also have a duty to support the minor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-6\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-7\">Applying the above-summarized principles to the facts of this case, it is clear that the parties and the circuit court erred in taking the position that the grant or denial of Carl\u2019s petition to resign should depend upon whether he had a duty to support the three boys under principles of equitable estoppel or contract. The grant or denial of Carl\u2019s petition in no way <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>depended upon whether he may have assumed a duty to support the children. The question of child support was an issue in the previously filed and still pending divorce action, and it should be adjudicated in that action. Since the grant of Carl\u2019s petition in this case rested upon the circuit court\u2019s conclusion with regard to the child support issue, the circuit court applied an improper standard. The correct standard was whether there existed good cause for Carl\u2019s resignation or whether that resignation was in the best interests of the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-4\">Ordinarily when a trial court\u2019s judgment is grounded upon an erroneous standard, we vacate the order and remand the case for the trial judge to decide the matter using the proper standard. <em>See, e.g., Fairbanks v. McCarter, </em>330 Md. 39, 49-50, 622 A.2d 121, 127 (1993); <em>Monroe v. Monroe, </em>329 Md. 758, 773-777, 621 A.2d 898, 905-907 (1993); <em>Robinson v. Robinson, </em>328 Md. 507, 513, 615 A.2d 1190, 1193 (1992); <em>Davis v. Davis, </em>280 Md. 119, 126, 372 A.2d 231, 234, <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 939, 98 S.Ct. 430, 54 L.Ed.2d 299 (1977). In addition, issues of \u201cgood cause\u201d or \u201cbest interests of the children\u201d should normally be resolved in the first instance by the trial court and not initially by an appellate court. <em>See, e.g., Fairbanks v. McCarter, supra, </em>330 Md. at 49-50, 622 A.2d at 126-127; <em>Monroe v. Monroe, supra, </em>329 Md. at 777, 621 A.2d at 907; <em>Domingues v. Johnson, </em>323 Md. 486, 498-503, 593 A.2d 1133, 1139-1141 (1991). Finally, the circuit court in effect granted summary judgment in this case, and \u201can appellate court ordinarily may uphold the grant of a summary judgment only on the grounds relied on by the trial court.\u201d <em>Ashton v. Brown, </em>339 Md. 70, 80, 660 A.2d 447, 452 (1995), and cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-5\">Application of the general rules concerning appellate review, set forth above, would require that we vacate the circuit court\u2019s order and remand the case for the circuit to rule upon the petition under the appropriate standards. Nevertheless, this case is somewhat unusual. Both in the circuit court and in oral argument before this Court, Mavis agreed that, except for the alleged duty of support, the petition to resign <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>should be granted. Mavis\u2019s counsel specifically conceded in oral argument before us that, ordinarily, a court should not force an individual to remain as a co-guardian against his or her wishes. Thus, the only dispute in this case relates to a matter which was not properly an issue, namely the duty of support. Moreover, under the circumstances\u2014particularly Carl\u2019s unwillingness to continue serving as co-guardian and Mavis\u2019s willingness to continue as guardian\u2014it seems clear that good cause and the best interests of the children required the granting of the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-4\">In light of the unusual circumstances, we shall affirm the circuit court\u2019s order granting the petition to resign as co-guardian. Nevertheless, because of the reference to the parties\u2019 submissions in the order, coupled with the parties\u2019 interpretation of that order, we shall modify the order to make it clear that the order does not represent any adjudication whatsoever with respect to the duty of support.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-5\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY MODIFIED AS SET FORTH IN THIS OPINION, AND, AS MODIFIED, AFFIRMED.
