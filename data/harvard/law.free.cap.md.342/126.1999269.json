The handgun was a Smith and Wesson 10 mm semi-automatic. Pursuant to Mary<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>land Code (1957, 1992 Repl.Vol., 1995 Cum.Supp.), Art. 27, \u00a7 442(b), a seven day waiting period is imposed on a prospective buyer of a pistol or revolver from a gun dealer while the information supplied by the applicant is reviewed by the State Police. Berg\u2019s application included a statement that, <em>inter alia, </em>he had never been convicted of a violation of Maryland Code (1957, 1992 Repl.Vol., 1995 Cum.Supp.), Art. 27, \u00a7\u00a7 286, 286A, or 286C, which prohibit the distribution, importation, manufacture, etc., of controlled dangerous substances.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">After Berg completed the application, the gun dealer, as required by Art. 27, \u00a7 442(d)(2), forwarded the application to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>the State Police which initiated a background investigation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After this investigation was completed, Berg was notified by-letter that his application had been disapproved. Although no reasons were given for the denial of the application, the letter stated that Berg could request a hearing in accordance with \u00a7 442(i).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>Following the disapproval, Berg requested a hearing, and, in June 1993, Berg and his attorney attended a hearing at the State Police barracks in Westminster, Maryland. At the beginning of the hearing, the hearing officer stated that a routine background check showed that, in 1990, Berg had been convicted in the Circuit Court for Howard county, upon a guilty plea, of violating Art. 27, \u00a7 287, by having possession of cocaine. The offense carries a maximum sentence of four years imprisonment. As a result of this conviction, Berg received a suspended sentence of four months and two years probation. According to the hearing officer, this conviction served as the basis for the State Police\u2019s disapproval of Berg\u2019s application to purchase a handgun.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">Although Berg\u2019s conviction for possession of cocaine was neither required to be reported on his application to purchase the handgun nor one of the statutorily enumerated offenses listed in Art. 27, \u00a7 445, that bars a handgun purchase under state law, the hearing officer pointed out that federal law prohibits the sale, receipt, and possession of a handgun when a prospective buyer has been convicted of a crime that is punishable by imprisonment for a term of more than one year. Specifically, the hearing officer relied on the Gun Control Act of 1968, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921 <em>et. seq., </em>which, <em>inter alia, </em>prohibits a gun dealer from selling a handgun to any person who has been convicted of a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year and also prohibits any person who is convicted of such a crime from possessing or receiving any handgun.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thus, according to the hearing officer, if the State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>Police were to approve Berg\u2019s application, the State Police would be sanctioning a violation of federal criminal law.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">At the hearing, Berg\u2019s attorney argued that federal law was inapplicable, that federal law could be applied only if state law adopted the federal statute by reference, that the federal statute could be validly applied only when there was some involvement with interstate commerce and, in this case, there was no such involvement, and that there was a procedure under the federal statute for granting relief from the prohibition. The hearing officer rejected these arguments and disapproved Berg\u2019s application. The hearing officer stated, however, that if Berg received either a pardon from the Governor or a grant of relief from the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms pursuant to the federal statute, his application would be approved.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">Berg filed in the Circuit Court for Carroll County an action for judicial review of the administrative decision. In the circuit court, Berg principally argued that \u201cthe applicable federal handgun law ... contains an interstate ... commerce <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>requirement for the law to apply,\u201d and, as a Maryland resident wishing to purchase a handgun from a Maryland gun dealer, Berg\u2019s transaction involved only intrastate commerce. Therefore, Berg contended, the federal statute, as a matter of statutory interpretation, was not applicable to this transaction. Berg alternatively argued that the statute could not constitutionally be applied to the transaction. In addition, Berg reiterated the other arguments which he had made at the administrative hearing. Since Berg\u2019s conviction was not disqualifying under the Maryland statute, Berg maintained that his application should be approved.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">Following a hearing, the circuit court issued a written opinion and an order reversing the decision of the State Police and remanding the case to the State Police for further proceedings in accordance with the court\u2019s opinion. Initially in its opinion, the circuit court rejected Berg\u2019s interstate commerce argument, holding \u201cthat there is no need for an interstate nexus to be shown\u201d and that the federal statute was within congressional power under the Commerce Clause.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The circuit court expressed some doubt about the propriety of the State Police enforcing federal law, although the court did not overturn the agency decision on this ground. Rather, the court reversed the administrative decision because the agency \u201cerroneously interpreted and applied the federal law.\u201d The circuit court thus stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-6\">\u201c[Berg] contends that there is no justification for the Maryland State Police to be enforcing, by their own mandate, Federal firearms law. The [State] responds by stating that the State Police have the duty to \u2018detect and prevent the commission of crime.\u2019 Md.Code Ann.Art. 88B, \u00a7 3. However, this is only a limited portion of the overall \u2018duties\u2019 set forth in the statute. The statute also provides that the \u2018Department shall have the general duty ... to cooperate with and assist law enforcement agencies in carrying out their respective duties.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>\u201cIn the present case, the [State] did not \u2018cooperate and assist\u2019 the Federal authorities in the enforcement of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922. Rather, the State Police \u2018assumed\u2019 the responsibilities of the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms ... by electing to enforce a federal regulation. Unfortunately, the [State] erroneously interpreted and applied the Federal law and, as such, a reversal is mandated.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">In explaining why the State Police and the hearing officer erroneously interpreted and applied federal law, the circuit court first quoted 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 925(c), which authorizes a grant of relief from the prohibition as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-5\">\u201c(c) A person who is prohibited from possessing, shipping, transporting, or receiving firearms or ammunition may make application to the Secretary [of Treasury] for relief from the disabilities imposed by Federal laws with respect to the acquisition, receipt, transfer ... or possession of firearms, and the Secretary may grant such relief if it is established to his satisfaction that the circumstances regarding the disability, and the applicant\u2019s record and reputation, are such that the applicant will not be likely to act in a manner dangerous to the public safety and the granting of the relief would not be contrary to the public interest----\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">From this provision, the circuit court concluded that the hearing officer was required to consider the factors enumerated in \u00a7 925(c) and decide whether circumstances in Berg\u2019s case justified \u201crelief from the disabilities imposed by Federal laws.\u201d In so concluding, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-8\">\u201c[I]t is abundantly clear that [the hearing officer] was of the erroneous opinion that the Federal statute mandated a denial in <em>all </em>cases where the applicant had been convicted of a two (2) year state misdemeanor. However, a careful reading of the Federal statute reveals that this simply is <em>not </em>the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-9\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-10\">\u201c[I]t is readily apparent that hearing officer may consider the circumstances of the conviction and the applicant\u2019s general standing in the community. However, the record in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>the present case amply demonstrates that no such consideration was undertaken in the present case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-4\">Since the State Police failed to consider the federal statutory factors which would authorize relief from the prohibition, the circuit court directed the State Police, upon remand, to evaluate the circumstances surrounding Berg\u2019s conviction. The agency was ordered to decide, pursuant to the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 925(c), whether Berg would likely act in a manner dangerous to public safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">The State appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, and, prior to oral argument in that court, we issued a writ of certiorari. The State argues that it is appropriate for the State Police to disapprove an application to purchase a handgun where the applicant\u2019s receipt or possession of the handgun would violate federal law. The State also contends that the circuit court erred in requiring the State Police to determine whether Berg should be granted relief under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 925(c). The State points out that the federal statute gives such authority exclusively to the Secretary of the Treasury or the Secretary\u2019s designee, and the Secretary\u2019s only designee is the Director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The respondent Berg, in addition to disagreeing with the State\u2019s arguments, contends that the federal statute cannot be applied to the transaction in this case because of the absence of an interstate commerce nexus.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">The first issue that we shall address is whether the State Police erred by enforcing federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">Both state and federal courts take the position that it is appropriate for state and local law enforcement officials to enforce federal law. The leading case is <em>Marsh v. United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number><em>States, </em>29 F.2d 172 (2d Cir.), appeal dismissed, 277 U.S. 611, 48 S.Ct. 563, 72 L.Ed. 1015 (1928), <em>and cert. denied, </em>279 U.S. 849, 49 S.Ct. 346, 73 L.Ed. 992 (1929), in which the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in an opinion by Judge Learned Hand, held that a New York state trooper was authorized, under both state and federal law, to arrest the defendant for a federal misdemeanor committed in the trooper\u2019s presence, namely a violation of the National Prohibition Law. After pointing out that \u201cit has been a universal practice of police officers in New York to arrest for federal crimes,\u201d 29 F.2d at 173, Judge Hand continued <em>(id. </em>at 174):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-4\">\u201cSection 2 of article 6 of the [United States] Constitution makes all laws of the United States the supreme law of the land, and the National Prohibition Law is as valid a command within the borders of New York as one of its own statutes. True, the state may not have, and has not,\u2019 passed any legislation in aid of the Eighteenth Amendment, but from that we do not infer that general words used in her statutes must be interpreted as excepting crimes which are equally crimes, though not forbidden by her express will. We are to assume that [New York] is concerned with the apprehension of offenders against laws of the United States, valid within her borders, though they cannot be prosecuted in her own courts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">The court in <em>Marsh </em>went on to hold that it would not attribute to Congress an intent to restrict enforcement to federal government officials or to the administrative machinery set forth in the federal statute, saying <em>(ibid.):</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-6\">\u201cIt may be that the United States, in respect of such arrests, is limited by the law of the state where the offender may be; but it would be unreasonable to suppose that its purpose was to deny to itself any help that the states may allow. Again, the uniform practice is persuasive. Other considerations forbid any such implication from the powers of arrest given to prohibition officers under section 26 of the National Prohibition Law. The Eighteenth Amendment gave concurrent jurisdiction to the states, and it would be in conflict with its underlying purpose to assume that, so far as the state laws assist in its enforcement, they were to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>curtailed by any administrative system which Congress might set up. The purpose of such a system was to secure obedience as far as possible; it cannot be supposed that, within a state which has no independent system of her own, such co-operation as she does extend must be rejected.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b559-4\">The Supreme Court of Arizona, in <em>Whitlock v. Boyer, </em>77 Ariz. 334, 338, 271 P.2d 484, 487 (1954), held that municipal police officers of Prescott, Arizona, were authorized to arrest two persons for attempting to pass counterfeit currency in violation of a federal statute. The Arizona court simply quoted from <em>Marsh v. United States, supra, </em>29 F.2d at 173, and stated that the <em>Marsh </em>holding represented Arizona law. <em>See also, e.g., United States v. Janik, </em>723 F.2d 537, 548 (7th Cir.1983) (\u201cWe infer that Illinois officers have implicit authority to make federal arrests\u201d); <em>United States v. Swarovski, </em>557 F.2d 40, 47 (1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 1045, 98 S.Ct. 889, 54 L.Ed.2d 796 (1978) (\u201cWe are entirely unpersuaded that the Legislature of the State of New York, in recodifying the criminal procedure law and the penal law of the State, either intended to or did in fact, dissolve all participation by the executive ... branch[ ] of the State government in dealing with federal criminal offenses\u201d); <em>Farley v. United States, </em>381 F.2d 357, 358 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>389 U.S. 942, 88 S.Ct. 303, 19 L.Ed.2d 295 (1967) (\u201cWe would be surprised if a state officer could not legally arrest a person who has committed a federal felony\u201d); <em>Bircham v. Commonwealth, </em>238 S.W.2d 1008, <em>1016, cert. denied, </em>342 U.S. 805, 72 S.Ct. 55, 96 L.Ed. 609 (1951) (defendant was engaged \u201cin the commission of a [federal] felony in the presence of the [municipal police] officers attempting to take him in custody. It not only was their right, it was their duty, to arrest him\u201d); <em>People v. Lafaro, </em>250 N.Y. 336, 165 N.E. 518 (1929); <em>United States v. Leland, </em>376 F.Supp. 1193, 1200-1201 (D.Del.1974) (\u201cit is beyond controversy that a state law enforcement officer can detain and arrest an individual for a federal violation if he has probable cause to believe the individual committed the offense\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>Although the Supreme Court of the United States has apparently not discussed and ruled upon the issue directly, several of its decisions rest upon the premise that it is appropriate for state officers to enforce federal law. <em>See, e.g., Miller v. United States, </em>357 U.S. 301, 305, 78 S.Ct. 1190, 1193-1194, 2 L.Ed.2d 1332, 1336 (1958) (arrest for federal offense by municipal police officer, and the Court stated that, in the \u201ccircumstance of an arrest for violation of federal law by state peace officers, ... the lawfulness of the arrest without warrant is to be determined by reference to state law\u201d); <em>United States v. Di Re, </em>332 U.S. 581, 589, 68 S.Ct. 222, 226, 92 L.Ed. 210, 217 (1948) (a municipal police department detective arrested the defendant for possessing counterfeit gasoline ration coupons in violation of a federal statute, and the Court held \u201cthat in absence of an applicable federal statute the law of the state where an arrest without warrant takes place determines its validity\u201d). <em>See also Ker v. California, </em>374 U.S. 23, 37, 83 S.Ct. 1623, 1632, 10 L.Ed.2d 726, 740 (1963); <em>Gambino v. United States, </em>275 U.S. 310, 48 S.Ct. 137, 72 L.Ed. 293 (1927).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">The reasoning of Judge Learned Hand in <em>Marsh v. United States, supra, </em>which has been followed by numerous other courts, is fully applicable in Maryland. As Judge Hand pointed out, in light of the Supremacy Clause,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> an Act of Congress \u201cis as valid a command within the borders of [a state] as one of its own statutes.\u201d 29 F.2d at 174. <em>See, e.g., Mondou v. New York, N.H. &amp; H.R. Co., </em>223 U.S. 1, 57, 32 S.Ct. 169, 178, 56 L.Ed. 327, 349 (1912) (\u201cWhen Congress ... adopted [an] act, it spoke for all the people and all the states, and thereby established a policy for all. That policy is as much the policy of [the state] as if the act had emanated from its own legislature, and should be respected accordingly....\u201d); <em>Md.-Nat\u2019l Cap. P. &amp; P. Comm\u2019n v. Crawford, </em>307 Md. 1, 13-14, 511 A.2d 1079 (1986); <em>County Exec., Prince Geo\u2019s Co. v. Doe, </em>300 Md. 445, 454, 479 A.2d 352, 357 (1984). This principle is underscored in Maryland by Article 2 of the Maryland Decla<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>ration of Rights, which mandates that federal law \u201cshall be the Supreme Law of the State.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">Consequently, we agree with the above-cited cases that state and local law enforcement officials may appropriately enforce federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">Most of the cases holding that state and local officials may enforce federal law arise in the context of an arrest by a police officer for a violation of federal law, and the issue concerns the legality of the arrest. A few cases arise in other contexts. <em>See, e.g., People v. Lafaro, supra, </em>250 N.Y. 336, 165 N.E. 518 (holding that a state official\u2019s enforcement of federal law is sufficiently part of his official duties so that one who attempted to bribe the official was guilty of the crime of bribery). No case involving circumstances like those in the case at bar has been called to our attention. Nevertheless, the principle set forth in the above-cited cases is fully applicable here. If a state police official is authorized to arrest someone for a violation of federal criminal law, the official is certainly authorized to withhold approval of an application to receive a handgun when receipt of the handgun would be a violation of federal criminal law. It would defy common sense to hold that the State Police were required to approve Randolph Berg\u2019s application to purchase a handgun and that, when Berg received the handgun pursuant to such approval, the State Police should then arrest him for violating federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">We hold, therefore, that in applying the provisions of Maryland Code (1957, 1992 Repl.Vol., 1995 Cum.Supp.), Art. 27, \u00a7\u00a7 441-448, the State Police may properly consider federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">Although it was appropriate for the State Police to enforce the prohibition set forth in the federal statute, the circuit court erred in directing the State Police to determine whether Berg should be granted relief from the federal prohibition.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">Section 925(c) of 18 U.S.C. authorizes an \u201capplication to the Secretary [of the Treasury or the Secretary\u2019s designee] for relief from the disabilities imposed by Federal laws with respect to the acquisition, receipt, ... or possession of firearms, and the Secretary may grant such relief if\u2019 certain criteria are \u201cestablished to his satisfaction....\u201d Congress vested the authority to grant relief under \u00a7 925(c) solely in the Secretary of the Treasury or his designee, and the Secretary\u2019s only designee is the Director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. Congress did not grant the authority to any other agencies, federal or state. Furthermore, the criteria for relief must be established to the satisfaction of the Secretary or his designee; whether some other administrative official or agency may be satisfied that the criteria are established is immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">The criteria for relief set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 925(c) do not constitute a statutory exception to the federal firearms prohibition, to be applied by any officials or entities involved in the enforcement of the prohibition. Instead, \u00a7 925(c) creates a specific administrative remedy in the United States Treasury Department, under which an applicant may be able to obtain relief from the federal prohibition. Treasury Department regulations prescribe a detailed administrative procedure, delineating the form and content of the application for relief, the type of documentary evidence to be submitted with the application, etc. <em>See </em>27 C.F.R. 178.144 (1995). It is only after someone applies for and obtains a grant of relief from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms that he or she falls within the exception to the prohibition set forth in \u00a7 925(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-9\">When Congress intended that remedial action by agencies or officials outside of the Treasury Department would have an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>effect upon the federal prohibition, Congress expressly so stated. For example, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(a)(20) provides in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-4\">\u201cAny conviction which has been expunged, or set aside or for which a person has been pardoned or has had civil rights restored shall not be considered a conviction for purposes of this chapter, unless such pardon, expungement, or restoration of civil rights expressly provides that the person may not ship, transport, possess, or receive firearms.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">The grant of relief in \u00a7 925(c), however, must be done by the Secretary of the Treasury or his designee, who is the Director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. Thus, the State Police hearing officer correctly held that Berg would have to obtain any grant of relief under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 925(c) from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">Finally, we reject Berg\u2019s argument that the federal statute cannot be applied to him because the transaction in this case was wholly intrastate.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">The federal statute\u2019s prohibitions upon commerce in firearms, set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922, have consistently been interpreted as reaching any transaction whereby the firearms at some time had \u201ca past connection to interstate commerce.\u201d <em>United States v. Fitzhugh, </em>984 F.2d 143, 146 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-9\">In <em>Scarborough v. United States, </em>431 U.S. 563, 97 S.Ct. 1963, 52 L.Ed.2d 582 (1977), the Supreme Court concluded that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1202(a), the statutory forerunner to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1), required only \u201cthe minimal nexus that the firearm have been, at some time, in interstate commerce.\u201d 431 U.S. at 575, 97 S.Ct. at 1969, 52 L.Ed.2d at 591. Similarly, in <em>Barrett v. United States, </em>423 U.S. 212, 96 S.Ct. 498, 46 L.Ed.2d 450 (1976), the Supreme Court, in applying 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(h), which ultimately was incorporated in the current \u00a7 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g), held the statute to be constitutional in reaching intrastate transactions between the convicted persons and gun dealers so long as the firearms had been transported at some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>time in interstate or foreign commerce.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>See also United States v.
