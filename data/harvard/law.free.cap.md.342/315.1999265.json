The issue is whether the shares of stock qualify as \u201cdeferred compensation\u201d under Maryland Code (1984, 1991 Repl.Vol., 1995 Supp.), \u00a7 8-205(a) of the Family Law Article, the ownership of which may be subject to transfer when distributing marital assets subsequent to a divorce.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b741-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">When apportioning marital assets in a divorce action, Maryland courts generally \u201cmay not transfer the ownership of personal or real property from 1 party to the other.\u201d \u00a7 8-202. The sole exception to this rule is found in \u00a7 8-205(a), which provides that in dividing marital property, a court \u201cmay transfer ownership of an interest in a pension, retirement, profit sharing, or deferred compensation plan from 1 party to either or both parties, grant a monetary award, or both, as an adjustment of the equities and rights of the parties concerning marital property.\u201d In this case, we are asked to determine whether the stock plan at issue here qualifies as a \u201cpension, retirement, profit sharing, or deferred compensation plan\u201d within the contemplation of \u00a7 8-205(a), which would permit a court, in its discretion, to transfer all or part of the interest in the stock from one spouse to the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b741-8\">Barry and Carolyn Klingenberg were married on August 10, 1968. The couple separated in 1986. Approximately one year later, they reconciled their differences and resumed cohabitation. The couple separated a second time around June 1, 1988, and Mrs. Klingenberg filed for absolute divorce on June 21, 1993. On July 26, 1994, the Circuit Court for Baltimore County (Hennegan, J.) awarded Mrs. Klingenberg a judgment of absolute divorce.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-9\">At the time of their reconciliation in 1987, following their first separation, the Klingenbergs signed a \u201creconciliation agreement\u201d which provided for the disposition of marital property in the event that they should separate a second time. Paragraph 4(b) of the reconciliation agreement provided for the disposition of a broad range of assets:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-10\">Within 30 days [of separation] all cash, savings accounts, checking accounts, certificates of deposit, money market funds, investment funds, stock and any and all like assets <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>are to be divided equally between the parties. The amount and/or value of any and all such liquid assets is to be fixed as of the date of separation of the parties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">In contrast, \u00b6 6 of that agreement provided for the disposition of Mr. Klingenberg\u2019s pension:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-5\">In the event the parties or either of them seek and obtain an absolute divorce, then in that event Husband shall consent to the entry of a Qualified Domestic Relations Order transferring one-half <em>($) of </em>the marital portion of Husband\u2019s pension to Wife. The marital portion of Husband\u2019s pension shall be determined by multiplying the pension benefits by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the total number of years of marriage and the denominator of which shall be the total number of years of Husband\u2019s employment accumulated towards the maximum allowable pension benefits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">The reconciliation agreement appears to have been intended to comprehensively divide the couples\u2019 liquid assets in the event of a future separation.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-7\">Mr. Klingenberg, as an employee of Whiting-Turner, participated in the company\u2019s pension plan. At the time of the divorce, Mr. Klingenberg agreed to transfer a share in this pension to Mrs. Klingenberg, as required by \u00b6 6 of the reconciliation agreement. In addition to this pension, however, Mr. Klingenberg had acquired several shares of stock in Whiting-Turner under these circumstances: On December 31, 1985, Mr. Klingenberg signed an agreement titled \u201cThe Whiting-Turner Contracting Company Stockholders Agreement.\u201d Under this agreement, Whiting-Turner authorized the issuance of 100,000 shares of common stock and 1,200,197 shares of preferred stock. The vast majority of the preferred stock, and therefore control of the company, was to remain in the hands of Willard Hackerman, the principal owner of Whiting-Turner. Twenty-seven employees of the company were eligible to purchase specified numbers of shares of the common stock at a price of $640.00 per share. Mr. Klingenberg was eligible to purchase, and did purchase, 15 shares of the common stock; a total investment of $9600.00. In return, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>according to the agreement, Mr. Klingenberg received certificates representing his ownership of the stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-4\">The stockholder\u2019s agreement placed restrictions on transfer of the stock. If Mr. Klingenberg were to attempt to sell his stock to a third party, Whiting-Turner could re-purchase the stock from him at the lesser of the stock\u2019s current \u201cbook\u201d value or the original $640.00 per share investment. It also could purchase the shares at this low value if Mr. Klingenberg\u2019s stock were attached or subjected to execution by a creditor, or if Klingenberg declared bankruptcy, or if he attempted to assign the stock for the benefit of a creditor, or \u201cif any portion of his Stock is made subject to a charging order.\u201d Finally, Mr. Klingenberg would be required to sell his stock to Whiting-Turner at this lower value if he terminated his employment for any reason other than death, retirement at age 65, or because of a permanent disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">If Mr. Klingenberg\u2019s employment with Whiting-Turner were to end because of his death, retirement, or disability, the agreement requires Whiting-Turner to re-purchase his stock under a more generous valuation. In these circumstances, the stock would be purchased using the <em>greater </em>of the stock\u2019s \u201cbook value\u201d or the original investment. The \u201cbook value\u201d of the stock is determined annually by Whiting-Turner\u2019s independent accountants, based on a valuation of the company\u2019s total value. It would not be required to repurchase the stock if it had insufficient surplus or credit restrictions, or if adverse tax consequences would result. In the event that Whiting-Turner would not repurchase the shares, the other shareholders would be able to purchase them from Mr. Klingenberg or his estate upon the same terms as Whiting-Turner.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">On June 30, 1994, during the divorce proceedings, the parties entered an agreement on the record disposing of all marital property except the Whiting-Turner stock. In announcing the terms of the parties\u2019 agreement, Mr. Klingenberg\u2019s attorney stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-7\">[w]ith respect to the Shadow stock or the stock of the Whiting-Turner senior employees, this is the one issue that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>we cannot resolve as of yet. We will ask the Court to reserve on that particular issue for a ... factual determination of the value of that stock [on] 6/1/88 and we would ask the Court to give us some period of time within the next 60 days ... to produce expert valuation evidence and testimony so that the Court can make a determination of the value.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ab2\">At that point, Mrs. Klingenberg\u2019s attorney argued that Mrs. Klingenberg was entitled to half of the proceeds from the Whiting-Turner stock \u201cif, as, and when\u201d they are distributed to Mr. Klingenberg. The parties agreed that the circuit court would review the reconciliation agreement and if it determined that the Whiting-Turner stock was a pension plan, it could enter an order distributing the proceeds from the stock if, as, and when Mr. Klingenberg sold the stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">On September 22, 1994, the circuit court held a hearing on the valuation of the Whiting-Turner stock. The two issues addressed at this hearing were how to characterize the stock, and whether the 1987 reconciliation agreement controlled the disposition of the stock. Mrs. Klingenberg\u2019s attorney introduced evidence of the value of the Whiting-Turner stock in 1994, arguing that the reconciliation agreement had been modified at the earlier hearing on June 30 with respect to the stock. In response, the court stated that it had no recollection of any such modification and \u201c[i]f that\u2019s not specifically stated on the record [of the earlier proceeding], I\u2019m not buying that it does.\u201d The court found that the transcript of the previous proceeding \u201cclearly says the opposite\u201d from Mrs. Klingenberg\u2019s argument that the reconciliation agreement had been modified with respect to the Whiting-Turner stock. When Mrs. Klingenberg\u2019s attorney persisted, the court suggested that it should vacate the prior order and re-litigate the entire property settlement. At this point, the attorney conceded that the court could take the original reconciliation agreement into consideration in resolving the issue of the stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">Each side presented expert witnesses at the hearing. Mr. Klingenberg\u2019s witness testified as to Whiting-Turner\u2019s stock plan and said that the stock should be valued at $9600.00, the amount Mr. Klingenberg would receive if he were to attempt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>to sell the stock on the date of the hearing. It was also maintained that the stock should be valued as of the date of separation in 1988. Mrs. Klingenberg\u2019s expert witness presented testimony as to the value of the stock plan in 1994, and testified as to the similarities and differences between the Whiting-Turner stock and a pension plan. In addition, the witness testified that the stock plan had been recapitalized as of January 1, 1990 and that the original common stock had appreciated to a value of $88,900 per share. The witness testified that after the re-capitalization, Mr. Klingenberg owned 58,350 shares of stock at a value of $10.00 per share.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-4\">In making its ruling, the court focused on whether the Whiting-Turner stock was a pension plan, one-half of the shares of which could be transferred to Mrs. Klingenberg under \u00a7 8-205(a). The court, however, found that \u201cthe burden has not been met to show it\u2019s a pension plan or a plan referred to in Family Law 8-205(a), which will allow me to transfer the rights to parties.\u201d The court provided a list of reasons as to why the stock was not a pension plan, specifically finding that the stock was not recognized by the federal government as a pension plan and that the stock was actually stock in Whiting-Turner, even though it was highly restrictive.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">After finding that the Whiting-Turner stock actually was stock, as opposed to some other financial arrangement, the court applied \u00b6 4(b) of the reconciliation agreement to value the stock as of the date of separation in 1988. In valuing the stock, the court found that Whiting-Turner had grown at least 15 percent per year and that Mr. Klingenberg paid $9600 for the stock at the end of 1985. The court applied the 15 percent growth rate from 1985 to 1988, and valued the stock at $14,600. The court entered a monetary judgment in favor of Mrs. Klingenberg for $7300.00, one-half of the value of the stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">Mrs. Klingenberg appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, asking it to hold that the circuit court\u2019s failure to apply \u00a7 8-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>205(a) was in error. We granted certiorari before the intermediate appellate court considered the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">Before us, Mrs. Klingenberg argues that the Whiting-Turner stock plan is \u201cdeferred compensation\u201d within the meaning of that term as used in \u00a7 8-205(a). Because the stock is deferred compensation,, she argues, the circuit court had the authority to transfer the stock on an \u201cif, as, and when\u201d basis. Mrs. Klingenberg further maintains that the court only decided to value the stock as specified in the reconciliation agreement because it had determined that it could not transfer a one-half interest in the stock to Mrs. Klingenberg under \u00a7 8-205(a). In contrast, Mr. Klingenberg argues that Mrs. Klingenberg failed to explicitly raise the issue of deferred compensation under \u00a7 8-205(a) in the court below and that the circuit court was correct in valuing the stock as specified in the reconciliation agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b746-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b746-8\">We hold that the Whiting-Turner stock is a deferred compensation plan within the ambit of \u00a7 8-205(a) despite the fact that Mrs. Klingenberg failed to specifically argue that point in the trial court. Maryland Rule 8-131 provides that \u201c[o]rdinarily, the appellate court will not decide any ... issue unless it plainly appears by the record to have been raised in or decided by the trial court.... \u201d We have frequently stated that the primary purpose of Rule 8-131(a) is to ensure fairness for all parties in a case and to promote the orderly administration of law. <em>State v. Bell, </em>334 Md. 178, 189, 638 A.2d 107 (1994); <em>Brice v. State, </em>254 Md. 655, 661, 255 A.2d 28 (1969). Rule 8-131 also provides that this Court may decide an issue not raised below \u201cif necessary or desirable to guide the trial court or to avoid the expense and delay of another appeal.\u201d The record in this case contains extensive testimony as to the nature of the Whiting-Turner stock plan, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>parties argued the applicability of \u00a7 8-205(a) at length without expressly focusing on that part of the statute pertaining to \u201cdeferred compensation.\u201d In addition, the circuit court did not limit its ruling to pensions, but held that it had no authority under \u00a7 8-205(a) <em>in toto </em>to transfer the Whiting-Turner stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">The circuit court based its ruling in part on the fact that an order transferring an interest in the stock to Mrs. Klingenberg would not meet the requirements for a Qualified Domestic Relations Order (QDRO) under federal law. We conclude, however, that the federal requirements for a QDRO do not constrain our determination of whether the Whiting-Turner stock is \u201cdeferred compensation\u201d under 8-205(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">In its present form, \u00a7 8-205(a) embodies the Maryland legislature\u2019s reaction to changes in federal laws regulating employee benefit programs.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In 1974, Congress passed the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), P.L. 93-406, 88 Stat. 829 (1974), \u201cin order to provide better protection for beneficiaries of employee pension and welfare benefit plans abounding in the private workplace.\u201d <em>Rohrbeck v. Rohrbeck, </em>318 Md. 28, 30, 566 A.2d 767 (1989). One of the changes made to federal law by ERISA was to impose an anti-alienation requirement on federally regulated pensions\u2014\u201ca \u2018spendthrift\u2019 provision precluding plan participants from assigning or alienating their benefits under <em>pension </em>plans subject to the Act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 30-31, 566 A.2d 767 (emphasis in original). In addition, \u00a7 514 of ERISA provided that the Act\u2019s basic requirements would supersede any state laws \u201cinsofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan\u201d subject to ERISA\u2019s requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>As we stated in <em>Rohrbeek, supra, </em>318 Md. at 32, 566 A.2d 767, \u201c[t]he combination of the anti-alienation provision ... and the preemption provision of ERISA \u00a7 514 eventually raised a question ... as to the validity of orders entered in State domestic relations proceedings requiring that pension benefits be paid to a person other than the plan beneficiary.\u201d Congress acted to clarify this ambiguity by passing the Retirement Equity Act of 1984(REA), P.L. 98-397, 98 Stat. 1433 (1984). Following passage of REA, ERISA\u2019s anti-alienation requirement no longer applied to judicial orders that could be classified as a \u201cqualified domestic relations order.\u201d <em>See </em>REA \u00a7 104; REA \u00a7 204. In order to qualify as a QDRO, a judicial order must, in addition to other requirements, be \u201cmade pursuant to a State domestic relations law.\u201d <em>See </em>REA \u00a7 104; REA \u00a7 204; 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1056(d)(3)(B)(ii)(II) (1994); 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 414(p)(1)(B)(ii) (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\">Prior to 1986, \u00a7 8-202(a)(3) of the Family Law Article flatly prohibited the courts from transferring ownership of personal or real property in a divorce action. Following passage of ERISA and the REA, therefore, it was possible that no domestic relations order in Maryland ordering the partition of a pension that was marital property would qualify as a QDRO, since the transfer was not pursuant to a State domestic relations law. As a result, it could be argued that such domestic relations orders were invalid because they had been preempted by federal law. <em>See Rohrbeck, supra, </em>318 Md. at 38, 566 A.2d 767. House Bill 1033 was passed in 1986 to address this problem. <em>See </em>Bill Analysis of House Bill 1033 (1986); Summary of Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee Report for House Bill 1033 (1986). This bill amended \u00a7\u00a7 8-202(a)(3) and 8-205(a) to allow the courts to transfer ownership of an interest in a \u201cpension, retirement, profit sharing, or deferred compensation plan\u201d as a part of a divorce settlement. <em>See </em>ch. 765, Laws of Maryland (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">Although the circuit court found that an order attempting to give Mrs. Klingenberg an interest in the Whiting-Turner stock would not qualify as a QDRO, the court also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>determined that the stock plan was not a pension plan. In addition, the parties agree that the stock plan is not a qualified benefits plan under ERISA or the tax code and is exempt from the funding, participation and vesting requirements imposed by federal law. <em>See </em>Michael J. Canan, <em>Qualified Retirement and Other Employee Benefits Plans </em>\u00a7 1.6(a) (West 1994). For this reason, the federal requirements for QDROs are not here applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-4\">As we have previously noted, the anti-alienation provisions in federal law \u201chave been held to apply only to <em>pension </em>plans subject to ERISA.\u201d <em>Rohrbeck, supra, </em>318 Md. at 38, 566 A.2d 767 (emphasis in original). Since QDROs were created under federal law to provide an exception to those anti-alienation provisions, they are not applicable here and we need not determine whether the Whiting-Turner stock could be transferred under a QDRO.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">To ascertain whether the circuit court could have given Mrs. Klingenberg an interest in the stock, we must determine whether it is \u201cdeferred compensation\u201d encompassed within the meaning of \u00a7 8-205(a). As we have stated on numerous occasions, \u201cthe cardinal rule of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate the legislative intention\u201d and \u201cthe language of the statute itself is the primary source of this intent.\u201d <em>Privette v. State, </em>320 Md. 738, 744, 580 A.2d 188 (1990). The words used in a statute are to be given \u201ctheir ordinary and popularly understood meaning, absent a manifest contrary legislative intention,\u201d <em>In re Arnold M., </em>298 Md. 515, 520, 471 A.2d 313 (1984), and \u201cwhere the language of the statute is free from ambiguity, courts may not disregard the natural import of the words used in order to extend or limit its meaning.\u201d <em>Privette, supra, </em>320 Md. at 745, 580 A.2d 188. The question, then, is whether the stock plan is a \u201cdeferred compensation plan\u201d within the popularly understood meaning of the word.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>Although \u00a7 8-205(a) was amended in response to changes in federal law, we find nothing in the legislative history which demonstrates an intent to <em>limit </em>a circuit court to only transferring interests which may be transferred subject to a QDRO. Since there appears to be no illuminating legislative history on this issue, we are left with the plain language of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\">Deferred compensation \u201cgenerally refers to money which, by prior arrangement, is paid to the employee in tax years subsequent to that in which it is earned.\u201d Michael J. Canan, <em>Qualified Retirement and Other Employee Benefit Plans </em>\u00a7 1.6 (West 1994). Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6th ed.1990) defines \u201cdeferred compensation\u201d as \u201c[Compensation that will be taxed when received and not when earned,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 421, and defines \u201ccompensation\u201d as \u201c[r]emuneration for services rendered\u201d or \u201c[Consideration or price of a privilege purchased.\u201d <em>id. </em>at 283. <em>See also Greensboro Pathology Associates v. United States, </em>698 F.2d 1196 (Fed.Cir.1982) (stating that \u201c[i]f something is a plan of deferred compensation it should by definition be compensation received in the future for work done in the past.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">While some deferred compensation plans may \u201csimply delay distribution of cash payments to employees,\u201d a deferred compensation plan may also accomplish other goals, such as tying receipt of the deferred compensation to continued performance by the employee or including covenants not to compete. Canan, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 2.4. The term \u201cdeferred compensation plan\u201d is frequently used to refer to special compensation arrangements offered to highly paid executives. <em>See </em>Andrew Lawlor &amp; Mark Manin, Nonqualified Deferred Compensation for Key Executives, <em>in </em>Employee Benefits Handbook \u00a7 13-2 (Fred K. Foulkes ed.1982); <em>see also </em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 421 (defining \u201cnonqualified deferred compensation plans\u201d as \u201c[c]ompensation arrangements which are frequently offered to executives\u201d and noting that \u201c[s]uch plans may include stock options, restricted stock, etc.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>The stock plan at issue here was designed with the intention of retaining key executives by providing a long-term incentive to remain with Whiting-Turner. Mr. Klingenberg was given the opportunity to invest in the stock plan as an incident to his employment with Whiting-Turner, and will receive the highest level of benefits under the stock plan if he remains with the company until retirement. We conclude that the Whiting-Turner stock plan is a \u201cdeferred compensation plan\u201d within the \u201cordinary and popularly understood meaning\u201d of the term. <em>In re Arnold M., supra, </em>298 Md. at 520, 471 A.2d 313.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b751-4\">In view of this conclusion, we shall remand the case for further proceedings. We cannot order the court below to transfer an interest in the Whiting-Turner stock at this time for two reasons. First, \u00a7 8-205(a) gives the circuit court the discretion to transfer an interest in a deferred compensation plan, but does not require it to do so. Thus, the circuit court may not have chosen to apply \u00a7 8-205(a) even if it had determined that it had such authority. Second, it is quite possible that the stock could be both \u201cdeferred compensation\u201d under \u00a7 8-205(a) and \u201cstock\u201d as used in the reconciliation agreement. In this event, the circuit court must determine whether to apply the reconciliation agreement and value the stock as of 1988, or to exercise its authority under \u00a7 8-205(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE COUNTY VACATED; CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION; COSTS TO BE DIVIDED EQUALLY BETWEEN THE PARTIES.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b740-10\">. Unless otherwise stated, all statutory references are to the Family Law Article.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b747-8\">. We discussed the relevant history of these federal laws at length in <em>Rohrbeck v.

At the same time, it is apparent that the plan provides compensation not only for Mr. Klingenberg\u2019s past services, but is intended to compensate him for future services by providing him with an incentive to remain with Whiting-Turner until retirement. If, upon remand, the circuit court chooses to order Mr. Klingenberg to distribute a share of the profits from the Whiting-Turner stock on an if, as, and when basis, the circuit court must determine how much of the stock value at the time of retirement is a result of compensation received before the divorce and how much is a result of compensation earned subsequent to the divorce. Mrs. Klingenberg will only be entitled to a one-half share of the compensation earned prior to the divorce.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
