The posted speed limit was fifty miles per hour. As Broberg drove over the crest of a hill, he struck and killed eleven-year-old Thomas Blank, Jr., who was driving a tractor across the road. At the time of the accident, Broberg\u2019s speed was estimated at approximately sixty-four miles per hour. His blood alcohol level was measured at 0.17.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-8\">Broberg was indicted in the Circuit Court for Frederick County on thirteen charges, including manslaughter by automobile, homicide by motor vehicle while intoxicated, driving while intoxicated, reckless driving, exceeding the speed limit, speed greater than reasonable and prudent, failure to reduce speed to avoid an accident, and other related offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-9\">Broberg was tried before a jury in the Circuit Court for Frederick County in November, 1993. During its opening statement, the State displayed two \u201cin life\u201d photographs of the victim: a sixth-grade school picture, and a photograph of the victim in his little league uniform. Defense counsel objected and moved for a mistrial, arguing that the photographs were irrelevant, and that they could not be shown to the jury until they were introduced in evidence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The trial judge denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>The State used the photographs a second time during its direct examination of the victim\u2019s father, Thomas Blank, Sr. When Mr. Blank was shown the photographs and asked to identify the victim, he wept. Defense counsel again objected and moved for a mistrial, arguing that the photographs were irrelevant in light of the parties\u2019 prior stipulation to the victim\u2019s identity. The prosecutor, however, disputed the scope of the stipulation, stating \u201cthat\u2019s not what he stipulated to, your honor, for the record.\u201d <em>See infra </em>Section IV.B and note 13. The trial judge denied the motion, and the prosecutor displayed the two photographs to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-5\">Broberg was convicted of homicide by motor vehicle while intoxicated, driving while intoxicated, reckless driving, exceeding the speed limit, speed greater than reasonable and prudent, and failure to reduce speed to avoid an accident. He was sentenced to five years imprisonment with all but eighteen months suspended, a fine of $3350 with $1500 suspended, and three years supervised probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-6\">Broberg noted a timely appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. The intermediate appellate court reversed the judgment in an unreported opinion, concluding that the photographs should have been excluded because they were of minimal probative value and were highly prejudicial. We granted the State\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari to resolve the issue of the admissibility of \u201cin life\u201d photographs in criminal cases.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b973-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-5\">The State contends that admission of the \u201cin life\u201d photographs was within the trial court\u2019s discretion, and therefore that the Court of Special Appeals should not have reversed the trial court\u2019s decision. The State also argues that the photographs provided relevant background information to \u201chumanize\u201d the victim, consistent with the purposes of Maryland Code (1957, 1992 Repl.Vol., 1995 Cum.Supp.) \u00a7 761 of Article 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-6\">Respondent argues that the trial court abused its discretion in permitting the State to use the \u201cin life\u201d photographs because he contends that the parties agreed to stipulate to the victim\u2019s identity, thereby eliminating the photographs\u2019 probative value. The photographs thus served only to inflame the jury, and their probative value was outweighed by their prejudicial effect. Furthermore, Respondent argues that the error in admitting the photographs was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Finally, Respondent argues that neither Article 47 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights nor \u00a7 761 of Article 27 creates a right for a homicide victim to be represented in a criminal proceeding by use of an \u201cin life\u201d photograph.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b974-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-5\">A. <em>Admissibility of Photographic Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"AgZr\">This Court has on many occasions considered the admissibility of photographic evidence. <em>See, e.g., Johnson v. State, </em>303 Md. 487, 495 A.2d 1 (1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>474 U.S. 1093, 106 S.Ct. 868, 88 L.Ed.2d 907 (1986); <em>Cook v. State, </em>225 Md. 603, 171 A.2d 460 (1961), <em>cert. denied, </em>368 U.S. 970, 82 S.Ct. 445, 7 L.Ed.2d 398 (1962); <em>Smith v. State, </em>182 Md. 176, 32 A.2d 863 (1943). We conclude that \u201cin life\u201d photographs are subject to the same evidentiary analysis as other types of photographs.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-6\">As we have consistently stated, the general rule regarding admission of photographs is that their prejudicial effect must not substantially outweigh their probative value.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See, e.g., Bedford v. State, </em>317 Md. 659, 676, 566 A.2d 111, 119 (1989); <em>Harris v. State, </em>312 Md. 225, 245, 539 A.2d 637, 647 (1988); <em>Mills v. State, </em>310 Md. 33, 43, 527 A.2d 3, 7 (1987), <em>vacated on other grounds, </em>486 U.S. 367, 108 S.Ct. 1860, 100 L.Ed.2d 384 (1988). This balancing of probative value against prejudicial effect is committed to the sound discretion of the trial judge. The trial court\u2019s decision will not be disturbed unless \u201cplainly arbitrary,\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>303 Md. at 502, 495 A.2d at 8, because the trial judge is in the best position to make this assessment. <em>See, e.g., Bedford, </em>317 Md. at 676, 566 A.2d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>119; <em>Mills, </em>310 Md. at 43-44, 527 A.2d at 8; <em>Grandison v. State, </em>305 Md. 685, 729, 506 A.2d 580, 602 (1986), <em>cert. denied, </em>479 U.S. 873, 107 S.Ct. 38, 93 L.Ed.2d 174 (1986); <em>but see Buch v. Hulcher, </em>180 Md. 309, 313-14, 23 A.2d 829, 831 (1942).</p>\n<p id=\"b975-5\">Photographs must also be relevant to be admissible. J. Murphy, Jr., Maryland Evidence Handbook \u00a7 1102, at 578 (2d ed. 1993 <em>&amp; </em>1995 Cum. Supp.); <em>see also </em>3 Wigmore on Evidence \u00a7 792, at 237 (Chadbourn rev. 1981 &amp; 1990 Supp.). We have found crime scene and autopsy photographs of homicide victims relevant to a broad range of issues, including the type of wounds, the attacker\u2019s intent, and the modus operandi. <em>See, e.g., Clarke v. State, </em>238 Md. 11, 21-22, 207 A.2d 456, 461-62 (1965). \u201cIn life\u201d photographs are often relevant to establish the victim\u2019s identity. See Annot., <em>Homicide: Identification of Victim, </em>86 A.L.R.2d 722, 739 (1962). The relevancy determination is also committed to the trial judge\u2019s discretion.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 5 L. McLain, Maryland Evidence \u00a7 403.5, at Supp. 106 (1987 &amp; 1994 Supp.).</p>\n<p id=\"b975-6\">In assessing the relevance of photographic evidence, we note that photographs may be relevant and possess probative value even though they often illustrate something that has already been presented in testimony. <em>Grandison, </em>305 Md. at 730, 506 A.2d at 602. As we observed in <em>Johnson v. State, </em>\u201call photographic evidence is in some sense cumulative,\u201d 303 Md. at 504, 495 A.2d at 9, and \u201c[a]lthough ... cumulative, it should seldom be excluded for that reason.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Murphy, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 1102, at 578. The rationale for allowing photographs to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>used to illustrate verbal testimony is that in some cases \u201cphotographs present more clearly than words what the witnesses were attempting to describe[.]\u201d <em>Reid v. State, </em>305 Md. 9, 21, 501 A.2d 436, 442 (1985).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b976-5\">We have also noted that photographs do not lack probative value merely because they illustrate a point that is uncontested. <em>Grandison, </em>305 Md. at 730, 506 A.2d at 602. For example, in <em>Evans v. State, </em>333 Md. 660, 637 A.2d 117 (1994), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 115 S.Ct. 109, 130 L.Ed.2d 56 (1994), we held that autopsy photographs were admissible in a capital sentencing proceeding even though the defendant had stipulated to the facts the photographs were offered to prove. Judge Karwacki, writing for the Court, observed that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AiJ\">[A] judge should exercise his or her discretion with caution when ruling on the admissibility of photographic evidence in capital sentencing proceedings. The need for caution, however, in no way circumscribes the judge\u2019s evidentiary authority; the admission of photographs into evidence remains soundly committed to the discretion of the trial judge in capital sentencing proceedings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b976-8\">Applying this standard to the facts before us, we cannot say that the trial judge abused his discretion in allowing these photographs into evidence. The photographs illustrated the number of shots fired at each victim and the pattern of the victims\u2019 gunshot wounds. It is immaterial for this purpose that Evans had stipulated to the cause of death, location of wounds, etc., for \u201cthe very purpose of photographic evidence is to clarify and communicate facts to the tribunal more accurately than by mere words.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b976-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 693, 637 A.2d at 133 (citations omitted). <em>Accord Grandison, </em>305 Md. at 730, 506 A.2d at 603 (\u201c[T]he particular photographs [are not] inflammatory to the jury solely on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>basis that they do not represent any issue in controversy. Further, since the photographs are mere graphic representations of undisputed facts already in evidence, their introduction could not be held to have injured the accused.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b977-5\">Although the trial judge possesses broad discretion regarding the admission of photographs, this discretion does not authorize the judge to admit <em>irrelevant </em>photographs. For example, in <em>Buck v. Hulcher, </em>180 Md. 309, 23 A.2d 829 (1942), an action for alienation of affections, we suggested that a photograph of \u201cplaintiffs wife closely and affectionately surrounded by her daughter and twin sons, very nice looking children and of tender years\u201d was irrelevant, given that the wife was present in court and testified on behalf of her husband.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 313, 23 A.2d at 831. Therefore, in determining the admissibility of any photograph, the trial judge must make a two-part assessment: first, the judge must decide whether the photograph is relevant, and second, the judge must balance its probative value against its prejudicial effect. We will treat the trial judge\u2019s findings on these matters with great deference. <em>See, </em>e.g., <em>Void v. State, </em>325 Md. 386, 393, 601 A.2d 124, 127 (1992) (quoting <em>Durkin v. State, </em>284 Md. 445, 453, 397 A.2d 600, 605 (1979)). <em>See also </em>M. Rosenberg, <em>Judicial Discretion of the Trial Court, Viewed From Above, </em>22 Syracuse L.Rev. 635, 663 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b977-6\">B. <em>Admissibility of \u201cIn Life\u201d Photographs</em></p>\n<p id=\"b977-7\">In <em>Grandison v. State, </em>305 Md. 685, 506 A.2d 580, we applied the two-part test for the admissibility of photographic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>evidence to \u201cin life\u201d photographs. <em>Id. </em>at 729-30, 506 A.2d at 602. The defendant, Anthony Grandison, contracted to have David and Cheryl Piechowicz murdered to prevent them from testifying against him in a pending narcotics proceeding. <em>Id. </em>at 697, 506 A.2d at 585-86. Rather than killing the two intended victims, however, the assailant mistakenly killed Cheryl Piechowicz\u2019s sister, Susan Kennedy. <em>Id., </em>506 A.2d at 586. We determined that the \u201cin life\u201d photograph of Susan Kennedy was relevant to the issue of her resemblance to her sister. <em>Id. </em>at 729, 506 A.2d at 602. We upheld the admission of the photograph, concluding that there was \u201cno arbitrariness\u201d in the trial court\u2019s decision. <em>Id., </em>506 A.2d at 602. The Fourth Circuit later considered the same issue in <em>United States v. Grandison, </em>780 F.2d 425 (4th Cir.1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>495 U.S. 934, 110 S.Ct. 2178, 109 L.Ed.2d 507 (1990). With regard to the relevance of the \u201cin life\u201d photographs, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ApX\">Objections [to the \u201cin life\u201d photographs] were lodged on grounds of non-relevance.... [W]e perceive no strength in the argument, because [the victims] were central figures in the crimes that had been charged. They had to be identified.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b978-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 429.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-5\">The majority of appellate courts in other jurisdictions that have considered the admissibility of \u201cin life\u201d photographs have also upheld their admission. Annot., <em>Homicide: Identification of Victim, </em>86 A.L.R.2d 722, 739 (1962). <em>See also Drane v. State, </em>265 Ga. 255, 455 S.E.2d 27 (1995); <em>State v. Ash, </em>526 N.W.2d 473 (N.D. 1995); <em>State v. Brett, </em>126 Wash.2d 136, 892 P.2d 29 (1995); <em>State v. Mergenthaler, </em>263 Mont. 198, 868 P.2d 560 (1994); <em>State v. Walker, </em>252 Kan. 279, 845 P.2d 1 (1993); <em>State v. Williams, </em>313 Or. 19, 828 P.2d 1006 (1992), <em>cert. denied, </em>506 U.S. 858, 113 S.Ct. 171, 121 L.Ed.2d 118 (1992); <em>State v. Bertram, </em>591 A.2d 14 (R.I.1991); <em>State v. Ryan, </em>226 Neb. 59, 409 N.W.2d 579 (1987); <em>Com. v. Nadworny, </em>396 Mass. 342, 486 N.E.2d 675 (1985); <em>State v. Aswegan, </em>331 N.W.2d 93 (Iowa 1983); <em>State v. Brown, </em>306 N.C. 151, 293 S.E.2d 569 (1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. 1080, 103 S.Ct. 503, 74 L.Ed.2d 642 (1982); <em>Burgess v. State, </em>339 So.2d 121 (Ala. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>1976); <em>People v. Sullivan, </em>97 Mich.App. 488, 296 N.W.2d 81 (1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>308 N.W.2d 109 (1981). A number of these jurisdictions have adopted a two-pronged test for admissibility of \u201cin life\u201d photographs similar to our own standard. <em>See, e.g., People v. Stevens, </em>76 N.Y.2d 833, 560 N.Y.S.2d 119, 120, 559 N.E.2d 1278, 1279 (1990); <em>People v. Hendricks, </em>43 Cal.3d 584, 238 Cal.Rptr. 66, 71-72, 737 P.2d 1350, 1356 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b979-4\">A minority of jurisdictions have taken the position that \u201cin life\u201d photographs are irrelevant and prejudicial, and therefore have concluded that use of \u201cin life\u201d photographs is disfavored. <em>See, e.g., Com. v. Rivers, </em>537 Pa. 394, 644 A.2d 710, 716 (1994); <em>Valdez v. State, </em>900 P.2d 363, 381 &amp; n. 83 (Okl.Crim.App.1995). A few courts have articulated a higher standard for admission of photographic evidence; for example, Pennsylvania courts have suggested that if photographs are inflammatory, they must possess \u201cessential evidentiary value\u201d to be admissible. <em>Com. v. McCutchen, </em>274 Pa.Super. 96, 417 A.2d 1270, 1272 (1979), <em>vacated on other grounds, </em>499 Pa. 597, 454 A.2d 547 (1982) (\u201cessential evidentiary value\u201d standard upheld, but photographs excluded by trial court found to possess essential evidentiary value, although graphic). The rationale for this elevated standard with respect to photographs is that because they often merely repeat or restate evidence that has been presented in other forms, they do not justify any additional prejudice to the defendant. <em>See Rivers, </em>644 A.2d at 717. We have previously rejected this reasoning and have declined to apply an elevated standard of admissibility to photographic evidence. <em>Bedford, </em>317 Md. at 677, 566 A.2d at 120 (\u201cBedford alleges that where a photograph has only minimal significance, and no essential evidentiary value, the trial judge should be more inclined to exclude it if it is inflammatory. Nonetheless, we have not adopted such a test and require only that the trial judge not abuse his discretion.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b979-5\">We have found no jurisdiction, however, that has adopted a per se rule barring the use of \u201cin life\u201d photographs. When appellate courts have disapproved the admission of \u201cin life\u201d photographs, they have generally either found that the photographs were irrelevant, or that their probative value in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>particular case was outweighed by their prejudicial effect. <em>See, e.g., Rivers, </em>644 A.2d at 716; <em>Parker v. State, </em>292 Ark. 421, 731 S.W.2d 756, 763 (1987); <em>Stevens, </em>560 N.Y.S.2d at 120, 559 N.E.2d at 1279; <em>Boutwell v. State, </em>659 P.2d 322, 326 (Okl.Crim.App.1983). Furthermore, even those jurisdictions that have consistently criticized the use of \u201cin life\u201d photographs have upheld admission of the photographs where they were clearly relevant. <em>See, e.g., Shelton v. State, </em>793 P.2d 866, 870 (Okl.Crim.App.1990). For example, although the Oklahoma courts have often expressed disapproval of \u201cin life\u201d photographs, <em>see, e.g., Rawlings v. State, </em>740 P.2d 153, 162 (Okl.Crim.App.1987), the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals upheld the admission of an \u201cin life\u201d photograph of a murder victim despite the defendant\u2019s offer to stipulate to identity based on the victim\u2019s dental X-rays. <em>Shelton v. State, </em>793 P.2d at 870. The court upheld the admission because the photograph was necessary to support other testimony by people who had observed the victim with the attacker before the incident. <em>Id. </em>In addition, even where courts have disapproved the use of \u201cin life\u201d photographs, errors in admission have seldom been found prejudicial. <em>See, e.g., Valdez, </em>900 P.2d at 381; <em>Rivers, </em>644 A.2d at 716; <em>People v. Cox, </em>53 Cal.3d 618, 280 Cal.Rptr. 692, 716, 809 P.2d 351, 375 (1991), <em>cert. denied, </em>502 U.S. 1062, 112 S.Ct. 945, 117 L.Ed.2d 114 (1992); <em>Stevens, </em>560 N.Y.S.2d at 121, 559 N.E.2d at 1280.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-5\">C. <em>Effect of Stipulations</em></p>\n<p id=\"b980-6\">We must next consider the relevance of the \u201cin life\u201d photographs in this case in light of Respondent\u2019s contention that the parties stipulated to the identity of the victim. By definition, a stipulation is an agreement between counsel akin to a contract. <em>See Burke v. Burke, </em>204 Md. 637, 645, 106 A.2d 59, 63 (1954). Like contracts, stipulations are based on mutual assent and interpreted to effectuate the intent of the parties.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Id., </em>106 A.2d at 63. Parties are generally held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>bound by their stipulations. <em>Bloom v. Graff, </em>191 Md. 733, 736, 63 A.2d 313, 315 (1949). Although a stipulation by definition must be based on mutual assent, parties frequently dispute both the scope of the stipulation and the extent to which it precludes the parties from offering other evidence of the stipulated fact.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> As Wigmore observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b981-4\">A fact that is judicially admitted [stipulated] <em>needs </em>no evidence from the party benefiting by the admission. But his evidence, if he chooses to offer it, <em>may </em>even be excluded; first, because it is now ... immaterial to the issues ...; next, because it may be superfluous and merely cumber the trial ...; and furthermore, because the added dramatic force which may sometimes be gained from the examination of a witness to the fact (a force, indeed, which the admission is often designed especially to obviate) is not a thing which the party can be said to be always entitled to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b981-5\">Nevertheless, a colorless admission by the opponent may sometimes have the effect of depriving the party of the legitimate <em>moral force of his </em>evidence; furthermore, a judicial admission may be cleverly made with grudging limitations or evasions or insinuations (especially in criminal cases) so as to be technically but not practically a waiver of proof.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b982-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>9 Wigmoee on Evidence \u00a7 2591, at 824-25 (Chadbourn rev. 1981 &amp; 1990 Supp.) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b982-5\">In determining whether to admit evidence that is offered to prove a stipulated fact, courts must often balance the competing interests of the parties. <em>State v. Gilmore, </em>332 So.2d 789, 795-96 (La.1976). The party who offers to stipulate is entitled to obtain the benefit of his bargain, i.e., preventing the use of inflammatory evidence. <em>Id. </em>The party benefiting from the stipulation, however, may also be entitled to the \u201clegitimate moral force of his evidence.\u201d Wigmore, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 2591, at 824.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-6\">We believe, as Wigmore suggests, that because of these competing considerations, \u201cthere should be no absolute rule on the subject ... [and] the trial court\u2019s discretion should determine whether a particular admission is so plenary as to render the first party\u2019s evidence wholly needless under the circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 825, <em>cited in Gilmore, </em>332 So.2d at 795. <em>See also Burgess v. State, </em>339 So.2d 121, 123-24 (Ala.Crim. App.1976); Annot., <em>Criminal Trial\u2014Proving Conceded Fact, </em>91 A.L.R. 1478 (1934). We therefore conclude that the trial judge should retain the discretion to determine whether evidence may be admitted to prove a stipulated fact. In exercising this discretion to determine whether extrinsic proof of a stipulated fact is admissible, trial courts should consider, <em>inter alia:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b982-7\">(1) the intent of the parties, if any, regarding presentation of the proffered evidence;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b982-8\">(2) the incremental probative value of the evidence as compared to the stipulation, (i.e., where the evidence provides greater detail than the stipulation); and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b982-9\">(3) the potential unfair prejudicial impact of the proffered evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b982-10\">We shall review the trial court\u2019s decision in this regard for abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-5\">A. <em>Probative Value Versus Prejudicial Effect</em></p>\n<p id=\"b983-6\">Applying the two-pronged test for the admission of photographic evidence to the \u201cin life\u201d photographs in this case, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the photographs. In every homicide case, the State must establish the identity of the person killed. <em>Jones v. State, </em>188 Md. 263, 272, 52 A.2d 484, 488 (1947) (\u201cIn a homicide case the proof ... [must] establish ... the fact that the person for whose death the prosecution was instituted is dead.... \u201d). Either \u201cin life\u201d photographs or photographs taken after death may be used to establish the victim\u2019s identity. <em>Cf. Grandison, </em>305 Md. at 729, 506 A.2d at 602 (upholding admission of \u201cin life\u201d photographs of victims as well as autopsy photographs to illustrate medical examiner\u2019s testimony). The photographs of Thomas Blank, Jr., taken while he was alive were probative of the deceased victim\u2019s identity because his father\u2019s testimony connected the person depicted in the \u201cin life\u201d photographs to the person killed in the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-7\">Furthermore, although the photographs were prejudicial to Respondent\u2019s case, they were not <em>unfairly </em>prejudicial. The \u201cin life\u201d photographs were not used as part of a \u201cbefore and after\u201d comparison with autopsy photographs, a practice that some courts have suggested may exacerbate the prejudicial effect. <em>See, e.g., People v. Stevens, </em>76 N.Y.2d 833, 560 N.Y.S.2d 119, 120, 559 N.E.2d 1278, 1279 (1990). In addition, neither of the photographs was more prejudicial than autopsy photographs that are routinely admitted in homicide cases. <em>Accord Sample v. Campbell, </em>305 P.2d 1033 (Okl.1957) (In a wrongful death action, potential prejudice resulting from admission of a photograph of the victim, a young boy, in his sports team uniform, did not require reversal). Thus, the trial court decision that the potential prejudicial effect of the photographs did not outweigh their probative value was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>B. <em>Relevance of the Photographs in Light of a Stipulation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b984-4\">Respondent also argues that the photographs presented in this case were not relevant because the defense stipulated to the identity of the victim. Applying the principles regarding stipulations outlined in Section III.C, <em>supra, </em>we must next consider whether Petitioner and Respondent entered into a stipulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-5\">We are faced with conflicting information regarding the nature and extent of the stipulation. Before the trial began, at the conclusion of a bench conference, Respondent\u2019s counsel remarked to the judge that the parties had stipulated to the identity of the victim, and thus no photographs would be necessary.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Although the State\u2019s Attorney did not object, the record does not establish whether he was still a party to the bench discussion.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The record also indicates, however, that later in the trial, Petitioner and Respondent disagreed regarding the nature of the stipulation.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> At the hearing on Respon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>dent\u2019s motion for a new trial, Respondent\u2019s counsel again referred to a stipulation. Finally, at oral argument, Respondent contended that both parties agreed to stipulate to the victim\u2019s identity, while the State contended that there was no mutual assent to a stipulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-5\">This case illustrates the need to state the precise terms of a stipulation on the record. We are limited in our review to the information that appears in the record. In future cases, the proponent of a stipulation would be well advised to ensure that the terms of any stipulation are recorded, and that mutual assent is demonstrated. <em>See McLaurin v. State, </em>31 Md.App. 375, 356 A.2d 563 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b986-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>Assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that the parties did agree to stipulate to the victim\u2019s identity, the record illustrates that they consistently disagreed about which evidence was precluded by the stipulation. <em>See supra </em>note 13. As we noted in Section III.C, <em>supra, </em>the decision regarding whether a particular piece of evidence may be offered to prove a stipulated fact is committed to the sound discretion of the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-5\">Although the record does not reflect any direct statement by the trial judge whether the stipulation to the identity of Thomas Blank, Jr., rendered the \u201cin life\u201d photographs unnecessary, the judge considered the issue on at least four occasions. While the better practice is for the trial judge to state the basis for the decision on the record, the trial court is not required to do so.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>Beales v. State, </em>329 Md. 263, 270, 619 A.2d 105, 109 (1993). The trial judge was privy to a discussion of the terms of the stipulation in chambers that is not included in the record. He was therefore in a better position to determine whether the \u201cin life\u201d photographs were relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>In addition, although the relevance of the photographs derived from their use to prove the victim\u2019s identity, which was stipulated, the stipulation did not deprive the photographs of all relevance. <em>See Grandison v. State, </em>305 Md. at 729, 506 A.2d at 602. Photographs are inherently cumulative, whether used to illustrate testimony or, as in this case, in support of a stipulation. We reaffirm the position we stated in <em>Bedford, </em>that photographs need not possess \u201cessential evidentiary value\u201d to be admissible. 317 Md. at 677, 566 A.2d at 120. Furthermore, photographic evidence ordinarily does not provide the factfinder with new information, but rather with an alternative form of information. <em>See Johnson v. State, </em>303 Md. at 504, 495 A.2d at 9. The trial judge had discretion to determine whether this alternative form of information regarding the identity of the victim was \u201cwholly needless under the circumstances.\u201d Wigmore, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 2591, at 825. We hold that the trial judge\u2019s decision to admit the photographs was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-4\">C. <em>The Victim\u2019s Right to Be Present at Trial Under the Victims\u2019 Bill of Rights</em></p>\n<p id=\"b987-5\">Finally, although we conclude that the \u201cin life\u201d photographs were admissible in this case, we decline to adopt a per se rule that \u201cin life\u201d photographs are admissible in every case. Petitioner and Amici<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> suggest that Article 47 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights and \u00a7 761 of Article 27 require the automatic admission of \u201cin life\u201d photographs in order to effectuate the policy of representing the interests of victims in criminal proceedings. <em>See supra </em>note 3. Both Article 47 and \u00a7 761 were intended to ensure the utmost respect and consideration for the victims of crimes. <em>See also Cianos v. State, </em>338 Md. 406, 421-413, 659 A.2d 291, 294-95 (1995). We do not, however, interpret these broad provisions to preclude the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>judge from exercising discretion regarding the admission of photographic evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-5\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED.

While Petitioner argued that \"in life\" photographs should be admitted for this purpose to vindicate the rights of the victim, Petitioner also argued that the trial court properly exercised its discretion in admitting the photographs, because they were relevant and because their probative value was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>outweighed by the potential prejudicial effect. <em>See </em>Petition for Writ of Certiorari at 4-5.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b973-8\">.

Respondent was tried before the new Maryland Rules of Evidence entered into effect on July 1, 1994. Our analysis, however, would be unchanged under the new rules.

Because the majority\u2019s decision flatly violates a long established and consistently applied limitation upon this Court\u2019s exercise of its certiorari jurisdiction, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-4\">The Court of Special Appeals held in this case, <em>inter alia, </em>that, although \u201c[pictures of a homicide victim taken before his or her death will sometimes be relevant to the issue of identity,\u201d the pictures here were not admissible on this basis because \u201cthe parties stipulated to the victim\u2019s identity prior to trial.\u201d <em>(Broberg v. State, </em>Court of Special Appeals No. 458, Sept. Term 1994, slip opinion at 6).</p>\n<p id=\"b989-5\">The State\u2019s petition in this Court for a writ of certiorari did not in any way challenge this holding by the Court of Special Appeals. The State in its certiorari petition did not argue or even intimate that the trial judge had discretion to admit the photographs on the theory that they were relevant to identity. In fact, the State\u2019s petition did not even mention the word \u201cidentity\u201d in either the \u201cQuestion Presented\u201d or the portion of the petition entitled \u201cReasons For Granting the Writ.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b989-6\">The issue concerning the admissibility of the photographs which the State raised in its certiorari petition was whether they were admissible, in the discretion of the trial judge, to \u201callow[] the jury to become acquainted with the homicide victim through a display of \u2018in life\u2019 photographs of the victim.\u201d (Petition For Writ of Certiorari, Question Presented, at 1). The State\u2019s arguments for admissibility set forth in the certiorari petition were that the \u201chomicide victim may be \u2018humanized\u2019 during the trial stage through the use of \u2018in life\u2019 photo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>graphs,\u201d and the \u201cjury is acquainted with the defendant by virtue of being in the courtroom, but the victim is a \u2018faceless stranger,\u2019 \u201d that the \u201cState should be allowed to offer a \u2018glimpse of the life [which the defendant] chose to extinguish,\u2019 <em>\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and that, \u201cin the non-homicide context, the jury is introduced to the victim because often times, the victim testifies. Such is not the case with a homicide victim.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 3-4). The State specifically relied on the Maryland statutes and the constitutional provision relating to victim impact evidence and \u201cthe importance of fair treatment and representation of a victim during a criminal trial.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 4). The State characterized the issue which it was presenting as \u201ca novel issue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AMm\">This Court, believing that the State had presented an issue of public importance, granted the State\u2019s petition. There was no cross-petition in this case. Furthermore, our order granting the certiorari petition did not add an issue or change the issue presented by the State. Today, however, the majority does not resolve the important question which prompted the Court to take the case. Instead, the majority reaches an issue not raised in certiorari petition; it overturns a holding by the Court of Special Appeals which was not challenged in this Court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b991-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>The majority asserts that the question of whether the photographs were admissible on the ground that they were relevant to identity was raised in the State\u2019s certiorari petition because the State \u201calso argued\u201d in the petition that the photographs \u201cwere relevant and because their probative value was not outweighed by the potential prejudicial effect.\u201d (Opinion at 550-551, n. 2). The State\u2019s reference to \u201crelevant\u201d in its certiorari petition had nothing to do with \u201cidentity.\u201d Rather, as previously explained, the State argued that the photographs were relevant so as to allow the jury to become better acquainted with the victim. The weighing of probative value against the likelihood of unfair prejudicial effect is a consideration with regard to almost all evidence issues. See 1 Wigmore, <em>Evidence, </em>\u00a7 10a, at 674 (1983); McLain, <em>Maryland Evidence, </em>\u00a7 403.1, at 297 (1987). Once it is determined that evidence is admissible under some principle of evidence law, ordinarily a trial judge has the discretion to exclude it if the judge determines that the probative value is outweighed by the unfair prejudicial effect. The State\u2019s argument in its certiorari petition was that the relevancy and probative value of the evidence to \u201chumanize\u201d and acquaint the jury with the homicide victim was not outweighed by an unfair prejudicial effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-5\">Under the majority\u2019s reasoning, whenever a petitioner uses the words \u201crelevancy\u201d and \u201cprejudicial effect,\u201d the petitioner has thereby raised virtually any issue that might exist in the entire field of the law of evidence. The issue of whether the photographs were admissible because they were relevant to the element of identity in the homicide offense, and the issue of whether the photographs were admissible because they allowed the jury to become acquainted with the homicide victim in the same way that the jury is acquainted with a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>victim in a non-homicide case, are clearly separate and distinct issues. The State\u2019s certiorari petition raised only the latter issue; the majority decides only the former issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-5\">For more than twenty years, since the time when this Court\u2019s jurisdiction became largely dependent upon the issuance of a writ of certiorari, we have consistently held that, in a case decided by an intermediate appellate court, we shall not consider an issue unless it was raised in a certiorari petition, a cross-petition, or the order by this Court granting certiorari.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b992-6\">Recently, in Am. <em>Motorists Ins.

The word \u201cordinarily\u201d does indicate that there are exceptions. Nevertheless, neither the use of the word \u201cordinarily\u201d in Rule 8-131(b) nor the principle embodied in the rule,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> has been treated as granting a general discretion to reach an issue whenever the Court so desires in the interests of \u201cfairness.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> If it did, the amendment to Rule 8\u2014131(b), adopting an express exception for the \u201charmless error\u201d issue, would have been unnecessary.

They include jurisdictional questions,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> whether the trial court\u2019s order was appeal-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>able,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> a non-constitutional issue that -will enable the Court to avoid a constitutional question presented,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> whether the case has become moot,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> the question whether the trial court has either failed to render a particular type of judgment required in the action (e.g., a declaratory judgment) or has rendered a type of judgment that is beyond the Court\u2019s authority,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> state government sovereign immunity under Maryland law,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and where the failure of the Court to consider an issue would result in the violation of an important public policy, such as the requirement that administrative remedies be exhausted.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b996-5\">The issue decided by the majority today, namely whether the photographs were admissible because they were relevant to identity, falls within no recognized exception to the principle that this Court will only consider issues raised in a certiorari petition, cross-petition, or order of the Court. The majority\u2019s decision is inconsistent with the basic policy of the statutory provisions authorizing our certiorari jurisdiction. As pointed out by the Court in <em>Walston v. Sun Cab Co., supra, </em>267 Md. at 569, 298 A.2d at 397,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b997-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>\u201c[i]t should also be kept in mind that the statute contemplated that the desirability and public interest involved in granting certiorari are shown to us by petition and the matters presented to us by petition should logically be those considered by us unless we limit those matters for consideration in our order granting certiorari.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b997-5\">The majority\u2019s decision cannot be reconciled with our prior cases or with the language of Rule 8\u2014131(b). For this reason, I cannot concur with the opinion or the judgment of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-6\">Chief Judge MURPHY and Judge BELL have authorized me to state that they concur with the views expressed herein.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b988-10\">.

Whenever an issue raised in a petition for certiorari or a cross-petition involves, either expressly or implicitly, the assertion that the trial court committed error, the Court of Appeals may consider whether the error was harmless or non-prejudicial even though the matter of harm or prejudice was not raised in the petition or in a cross-petition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b989-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>\u201c(2) <em>No Prior Appellate </em>Decision-Except as otherwise provided in Rule 8-304(c), when the Court of Appeals issues a writ of certiorari to review a case pending in the Court of Special Appeals before a decision has been rendered by that Court, the Court of Appeals will consider those issue that would have been cognizable by the Court of Special Appeals.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b989-8\">.

In addition, the majority\u2019s approach is not very even handed.

The majority justifies its position on the ground that the defendant did \"not cross-appeal the denial of his motion\u201d and did not brief or argue the issue before this Court. (Opinion at 549 n. 1).</p>\n<p id=\"b990-7\">Of course, the defendant did not have to \"cross-appeal\u201d the denial of his motion.
