We are specifically asked to construe a clause of the agreement that terminates the husband\u2019s obligation to pay support if \u201cthe wife resides with any unrelated man without the benefit of marriage for a period continuing for beyond sixty (60) consecutive days.\u201d Based on our interpretation of the clause, we conclude that this language requires the husband to demonstrate that the wife established a cohabitation arrangement before he may terminate support. Because the trial court and the Domestic Relations Master erroneously interpreted the agreement, we shall remand the case to determine if the wife established a cohabitation arrangement.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-11\">On December 26, 1990, the Circuit Court for Montgomery County granted an absolute divorce to Sara and Joel Gordon. The court entered a Judgment of Absolute Divorce, which \u201cincorporated but did not merge\u201d the parties\u2019 separation agreement. The agreement included a support provision, which provided in pertinent part that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-12\">Husband shall pay to Wife as alimony the sum of $6,000 per month in advance, commencing on the first day of Decern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>ber, and continuing on the first day of each and every month thereafter. The said payments shall terminate upon the death of the Husband, the death of the Wife, the remarriage of the Wife, or at such time as the Wife reaches the age of 59 1/2, whichever first occurs. <em>The said payments shall also terminate in the event the Wife resides with any unrelated man mthout the benefit of marriage for a period continuing for beyond sixty (60) consecutive days.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aj9\">(emphasis added).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Mrs. Gordon\u2019s attorney drafted the last sentence of the support provision, which we shall term the \u201ccohabitation clause.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">Mr. Gordon paid support to Mrs. Gordon as provided in the separation agreement from the time of the divorce until the present dispute arose in 1993. In February of 1993, Mr. Gordon began to drive by Mrs. Gordon\u2019s home regularly to see if a car belonging to William Shankland was parked near the house in the morning. Mr. Gordon testified that he frequently observed Mr. Shankland\u2019s car parked near the home. Sus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>pecting that Mrs. Gordon was residing with Mr. Shankland in violation of the separation agreement, Mr. Gordon engaged a private investigator to conduct surveillance of Mrs. Gordon\u2019s house. The surveillance began on April 16, 1993, and continued through July 23, 1993. In a letter dated July 25, 1993, Mr. Gordon informed Mrs. Gordon that he would cease paying support because she had violated the support clause of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">Mr. Gordon filed a petition in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, requesting that the court confirm his termination of alimony, and that the court order Mrs. Gordon to repay alimony received since she began living with Mr. Shank-land in violation of the clause. The court referred the case to a Domestic Relations Master for an evidentiary hearing, pursuant to Maryland Rules 2-541 and S74A. At the hearing, Mr. Gordon presented evidence suggesting that Mr. Shank-land had no residence other than Mrs. Gordon\u2019s home for a period of more than sixty days. In addition, he presented evidence that Mr. Shankland used Mrs. Gordon\u2019s phone number as his own on a community theater group phone list. He also introduced checks from Mr. Shankland to Mrs. Gordon totalling nearly $12,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">In response, Mrs. Gordon testified that Mr. Shankland maintained a separate residence at all times. She explained that Mr. Shankland used her phone number on the community theater group cast list to avoid harassing phone calls from his ex-wife. She also testified that she and Mr. Shankland did not share expenses, and that the checks presented by Mr. Gordon represented Mr. Shankland\u2019s share of expenses for joint vacations, as well as repayment of loans with interest. Mrs. Gordon did not call any other witnesses to testify on her behalf.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b721-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>At the conclusion of the hearing, the Master found that Mr. Gordon had established that Mr. Shankland had no residence other than Mrs. Gordon\u2019s home for more than sixty days. She therefore concluded that Mrs. Gordon had resided with an unrelated male for more than sixty consecutive days in violation of the agreement. As a result, she recommended that the court confirm Mr. Gordon\u2019s termination of support payments to his ex-wife. The Master made no other findings regarding the relationship between Mrs. Gordon and Mr. Shankland.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">Mrs. Gordon filed exceptions to the Master\u2019s Report, contesting the Master\u2019s interpretation of the contract, the sufficiency of the evidence to support the Master\u2019s findings, and the Master\u2019s application of the \u201cmissing witness\u201d rule. The Circuit Court for Montgomery County heard oral argument on the exceptions on May 2, 1994. The court overruled the exceptions, but <em>sua sponte </em>requested that the parties brief and argue the issue of whether public policy precluded enforcement of the support clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">After oral argument of the public policy issue, the court concluded that the agreement was not contrary to public policy, and entered an order terminating Mr. Gordon\u2019s support obligation. Mrs. Gordon noted a timely appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. We issued a writ of certiorari on our own motion prior to consideration of the case by the intermediate appellate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-8\">The Appellant, Sara Gordon, contends that the Domestic Relations Master\u2019s finding that she had violated the terms of the separation agreement was not supported by sufficient evidence. In addition, the Appellant argues that the support provision of the agreement should be interpreted to require Mr. Gordon to demonstrate that her economic circumstances changed as a result of sharing her residence with Mr. Shank-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>land before he may terminate support. She urges this Court to \u201cheed the trend of courts across the country, who acknowledge increasingly that alimony modifications should, as a matter of law and in the absence of the parties\u2019 clear and unequivocal intent to the contrary, arise from changed economic circumstances, and not from punitive motives.\u201d (Appellant\u2019s Brief at 29).</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">The Appellee, Joel Gordon, contends that the evidence supported the Domestic Relations Master\u2019s finding that Mrs. Gordon violated the parties\u2019 agreement. He argues that once he presented <em>prima facie </em>evidence that the Appellant had violated the support agreement, the burden to rebut the evidence shifted back to the Appellant, and she failed to meet this burden. The Appellee also argues that the language of the support provision is unambiguous, and does not require proof of changed economic circumstances. Furthermore, Appellee argues that even if the support provision is interpreted to include an economic component, the proof offered established that Appellant cohabited with Mr. Shankland in violation of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">Maryland has long recognized and enforced spousal support agreements. <em>See, e.g., Weiss v. Melnicove, </em>218 Md. 571, 147 A.2d 763 (1959); <em>Dickey v. Dickey, </em>154 Md. 675, 141 A. 387 (1928). Although contracts between husbands and wives made in contemplation of divorce were traditionally considered unenforceable, parties are now explicitly authorized to enter agreements regarding support and property settlement by Maryland Code (1984, 1991 Repl.Vol., 1995 Cum.Supp.) \u00a7 8-101 of the Family Law Article.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The prevail<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>ing view is now that \u201cseparation agreements ... are generally favored by the courts as a peaceful means of terminating marital strife and discord so long as they are not contrary to public policy.\u201d 5 S. Williston, A Treatise on the Law of Contracts \u00a7 11:7, at 396-99 (R. Lord ed., 4th ed.1993). <em>See also </em>Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 190 (1979) (Illustration 2).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">Spousal support agreements frequently include provisions terminating support if the spouse receiving support enters a cohabitation arrangement. <em>See, e.g., </em>A. Turnbull &amp; J. Wase, Maryland Domestic Relations Forms 256 (1989 &amp; 1995 Supp.) (Form 14.3.9). These provisions take a variety of forms.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">One common approach is to define remarriage, which typically terminates the support obligation, to encompass cohabitation. For example, one form provision states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>For the purposes of this agreement the term \u201cremarriage of the Wife\u201d shall be defined as either a ceremonial civil or religious marriage <em>or a situation whereby the wife habitually and continuously resides with another man without benefit of a marriage ceremony for a period of 120 days consecutively or 120 days cumulatively within a sixteen-month period.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">S. Schlissel, 2 Separation Agreements and Marital Contracts \u00a7 19.28, at 511 (1986 &amp; 1992 Cum.Supp.). As the treatise author notes, frequently \u201c[problems arise with use of words such as \u2018habitually\u2019 and \u2018continuously.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 512.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">Other form agreements treat cohabitation as a separate basis for termination of support, independent of remarriage. For example, one such provision states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-7\">(A) The <em>[payor </em>] shall pay to the <em>[payee </em>], for his <em>[or </em>her] support, maintenance, or alimony, the sum of_dollars per week, until the death of either party, or the remarriage of the <em>[payee </em>], or the {payee\u2019s) cohabitation with another person, whichever event shall first occur.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-10\">(B) For the purposes of this Agreement, the term \u201ccohabitation\u201d includes <em>any shared occupancy of a dwelling, whether or not the occupants engage in sexual relations.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b724-11\">A. Lindey &amp; L. Parley, 1 Lindey on Separation Agreements and Antenuptial Contracts 15A-6 (1995) (Form 15A.05) (emphasis added). <em>See also </em>S. Green <em>&amp; </em>J. Long, Marriage and Family Law Agreements 372-73 (1984 &amp; 1994 Cum.Supp.) (Appendix 3) (\u201c[Support] shall continue until ... the death of the [h]usband, the death of the Wife, her remarriage, or her cohabitation with another person with whom she has a romantic relationship.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-12\">Some form agreements state the term \u201ccohabitation\u201d without additional explanation, while others further define or restrict the term in some fashion. For example, some provisions require a financial relationship between the cohabitants as a condition for terminating support. One provision states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>The Wife shall also be deemed to have remarried for the purpose of this Article if she shall live with an unrelated adult male to whom she is not legally married in the same abode in a situation where the parties are, in effect, living as Husband and Wife and the unrelated adult male should be supporting, or contributing to the support, of the Wife.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A1_\">Schlissel, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 19.31, at 513.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">Other form agreements require common residence for a specific length of time to establish cohabitation. The interval of continuous residence required to establish cohabitation varies, ranging from 30 to 180 days. <em>See, e.g., id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 19.28, 19.30, at 511-12; Turnbull <em>&amp; </em>Wase, <em>supra, </em>at 256 (\u201cremarriage shall be defined so as to include her cohabitation or residing with an unrelated male for either thirty (30) consecutive days or ninety (90) days in any one hundred eighty (180) day period.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">Because form agreements typically use the term \u201ccohabitation\u201d or an analogous term, interpretation of these provisions turns on the definition of \u201ccohabitation.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Ordin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>arily, \u201c[t]he common or normal meaning of language will be given to the words of a contract unless the circumstances show that in a particular case a special meaning should be attached to it.\u201d 4 S. Williston, A Treatise on the Law of Contracts \u00a7 618, at 705 (W. Jaeger ed., 3d ed. 1961 &amp; 1995 Cum.Supp.). The dictionary definition of \u201ccohabitation,\u201d together with the factors that have been developed by the courts to explain the definition, constitute its ordinary meaning. We shall interpret \u201ccohabitation\u201d according to the ordinary meaning unless the parties indicate additional requirements or an alternative definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary defines \u201ccohabit\u201d as \u201cto live together as husband and wife usually without a legal marriage having been performed.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 440 (P. Gove ed., 1963). Similarly, Black\u2019s Law Dictionary defines \u201ccohabitation\u201d as \u201c[t]o live together as husband and wife. The mutual assumption of those marital rights, duties and obligations which are usually manifested by married people, including but not necessarily dependent on sexual relations.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 260 (6th ed.1990) (citations omitted). Courts have developed a number of factors to consider in determining whether two parties \u201clive together as man and wife.\u201d <em>See In re Marriage of Desler, </em>56 Or.App. 812, 643 P.2d 655, 658 (1982). The determination of whether an arrangement constitutes \u201ccohabitation\u201d is a factual issue to be decided on the specific facts of each case. <em>In re Marriage of Edwards, </em>73 Or.App. 272, 698 P.2d 542, 546 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b727-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>While we have not previously detailed the factors characterizing a cohabitation arrangement, the Court of Special Appeals considered a similar issue in <em>Fisher v. Fisher, </em>75 Md.App. 193, 540 A.2d 1165 (1988), <em>cert. denied, </em>313 Md. 30, 542 A.2d 857 (1988). In <em>Fisher, </em>the intermediate appellate court interpreted a separation agreement providing for termination of spousal support if the wife \u201cremarried or enter[ed] into a marriage-type arrangement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 195, 540 A.2d at 1166. Chief Judge Wilner, writing for the Court, observed that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-5\">Although there is obviously no single mold into which all marriages (and therefore all \u201cmarriage-type relationships\u201d) will fit, we think that the term envisions at least the normally accepted attributes of a marriage\u2014a common residence which each party regards as his or her home, <em>a common household to which each contributes, </em>and a personal relationship that is more than casual and has significant meaning to each. These things are measured, of course, by living arrangements, by <em>shared assets and expenses, </em>and by how the parties and the community view their relationship.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b727-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 202, 540 A.2d at 1169 (emphasis added). <em>Accord Salas v. Salas, </em>128 A.D.2d 849, 513 N.Y.S.2d 770, 772 (1987) (holding that wife was not \u201cliving together\u201d with an unrelated male, triggering termination of support, in part because the two had not formed an \u201ceconomic unit\u201d), <em>appeal dismissed without op., </em>70 N.Y.2d 747, 519 N.Y.S.2d 1033, 514 N.E.2d 391 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">Courts in other jurisdictions have developed similar characteristics to determine whether parties have established a cohabitation relationship. For example, in <em>Beck v. Beck, </em>286 Ala. 692, 246 So.2d 420 (1971), the Alabama Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-8\">We think cohabitation as that word is used in our cases encompasses many factors which are necessarily involved when a man and a woman dwell together as man and wife. We think it may or may not, under the circumstances of the particular ease, include sexual activity, but it does include such things as eating together, sharing household duties, payment of household expenses, holding themselves out to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>the public as man and wife, and all of the numerous aspects of day-to-day mutual existence of married persons.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b728-5\"><em>Id., </em>246 So.2d at 428. More recently, in <em>State v. Kellogg, </em>542 N.W.2d 514 (1996), the Iowa Supreme Court approved six factors for courts to consider in determining whether a couple is cohabiting<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-6\">1. Sexual relations between the parties while sharing the same living quarters.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-7\">2. Sharing of income or expenses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-8\">3. Joint use or ownership of property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-9\">4. Whether the parties hold themselves out as husband and wife.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-10\">5. The continuity of the relationship.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-11\">6. The length of the relationship.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b728-12\"><em>Id. </em>at 518 (citing <em>People v. Holifield, </em>205 Cal.App.3d 993, 252 Cal.Rptr. 729, 734 (1988)).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b729-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>Even courts that have not required proof of a financial relationship to establish cohabitation have acknowledged that shared finances are persuasive evidence of cohabitation. <em>See, e.g., Haddow v. Haddow, </em>707 P.2d 669, 673 (Utah 1985). For example, the Utah Supreme Court has stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-5\">Our review of out-of-state case law discloses that in some jurisdictions a third element, shared living expenses, is either an essential ingredient of cohabitation ... or evidence of it.... Although we do not consider the sharing of the financial obligations surrounding the maintenance of a household to be a requisite element of cohabitation, we do find it significant that [the alleged cohabitant] did not pay any of appellant\u2019s living expenses or consistently share with her any of his assets.... His occasional payments to appellant ... were reimbursements and evidence an intent to bear his own expenses, not an intent to contribute to appellant\u2019s household.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b729-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 673-74. <em>See also Frey v. Frey, </em>14 Va.App. 270, 416 S.E.2d 40, 43 (1992) (\u201c[W]e hold that the phrase, \u2018cohabitation, analogous to a marriage,\u2019 means a status in which a man and woman live together continuously, or with some permanency, mutually assuming duties and obligations normally attendant with a marital relationship. It involves more than living together for a period of time and having sexual relations....\u201d); <em>In re Marriage of Edwards, </em>73 Or.App. 272, 698 P.2d 542, 547 (1985).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>We conclude that the term \u201ccohabitation\u201d implies more than merely a common residence or a sexual relationship. We believe the ordinary definition of \u201ccohabitation,\u201d describing a relationship of living together \u201cas man and wife,\u201d connotes mutual assumption of the duties and obligations associated with marriage. To guide trial courts in applying this definition, we have formulated a list of factors to consider in determining whether a relationship constitutes cohabitation. We emphasize, however, that the list is non-exhaustive, and that no one factor serves as an absolute prerequisite for cohabitation. In interpreting \u201ccohabitation,\u201d courts may consider indicia such as:</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">1. establishment of a common residence;<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">2. long-term intimate or romantic involvement;<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b731-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>3. shared assets or common bank accounts;</p>\n<p id=\"b731-4\">4. joint contribution to household expenses; and<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">5. recognition of the relationship by the community.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">The factfinder should review these factors and any other relevant evidence in determining whether parties have established a cohabitation relationship. <em>See In re Marriage of Wessling, </em>12 Kan.App.2d 428, 747 P.2d 187, 190-91 (1987). <em>Cf. Frey, </em>14 Va.App. 270, 416 S.E.2d at 43-44.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">Contrary to the view of some courts, we do not interpret \u201ccohabitation\u201d to require the couple to hold themselves out as spouses. <em>Compare Sitarek v. Sitarek, </em>179 A.D.2d 1064, 579 N.Y.S.2d 522, 523 (1992) (under \u00a7 248 of New York\u2019s Domestic Relations Laws, must show parties are holding themselves out as man and wife to establish cohabitation). We include the fifth factor, recognition of the relationship by the community, however, to address situations where parties have celebrated an unofficial marriage ceremony, wear wedding rings, use each others\u2019 names, or otherwise indicate to the community that they are married. Under these circumstances, if the ex-spouse and the cohabitant share expenses, the ex-spouse collects support from two sources. Alternately, if the cohabitant does not pay a fair share of the household expenses, then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>it follows that part of the support payment supports the cohabitant rather than the ex-spouse. In either situation, we believe it would be inequitable to require the spouse paying support to continue payment despite the cohabiting parties\u2019 <em>de facto </em>remarriage. <em>See, e.g., Weseman v. Weseman, </em>51 Or.App. 675, 626 P.2d 942, 944 (1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>291 Or. 118, 631 P.2d 341 (1981); <em>Miller v. Miller, </em>352 Pa.Super. 432, 508 A.2d 550, 554 (1986).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>See also In re Marriage of Morrison &amp; Morrison, </em>139 Or.App. 137, 910 P.2d 1176, 1179 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">Parties may alter the definition of cohabitation if they choose, subject to the limitations of law and public policy. <em>See Md. Nat\u2019l Cap. P. &amp; P. v. Wash. Nat\u2019l Arena, </em>282 Md. 588, 605-06, 386 A.2d 1216, 1228 (1978); <em>see also </em>4 S. Williston, A Treatise on the Law of Contracts \u00a7\u00a7 615, 615A, at 597-599, 630-631 (W. Jaeger ed., 3d ed. 1961 &amp; 1995 Cum.Supp.). Ordinarily, however, we shall assign each word its usual meaning \u201cunless the circumstances show that in a particular case a special meaning should be attached.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 618, at 705. Thus, if the parties to a separation agreement use the term \u201ccohabitation\u201d or an analogous term, we shall interpret its meaning according to the definition outlined above absent evidence of an intent to use a different meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">We shall next apply the principles outlined above to interpret the language of the separation agreement. Specifically, we must determine whether the agreement requires Mr. Gordon to prove that Mrs. Gordon established a cohabitation arrangement with Mr. Shankland. The operative language we must construe is the phrase \u201cresides with any unrelated man without the benefit of marriage for a period continuing for beyond sixty (60) consecutive days.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">We shall read this provision so that no part of it is redundant or meaningless. We interpret the phrase \u201cresides with any unrelated man without the benefit of marriage\u201d as a synonym for cohabitation. <em>Compare Fisher v. Fisher, 75 </em>Md.App. 193, 200, 540 A.2d 1165, 1168-69 (1988), <em>cert. denied, </em>313 Md. 30, 542 A.2d 857 (1988). If the clause was intended to encompass all situations where Mrs. Gordon resided with an unrelated male, including, <em>e.g., </em>roommates and boarders, the phrase \u201cwithout the benefit of marriage\u201d would be redundant with \u201cunrelated.\u201d <em>Cf. In re Marriage of Molloy, </em>635 P.2d 928, 929-30 (Colo.Ct.App.1981) (wife\u2019s male roommate not considered a cohabitant). Therefore, we interpret the phrase \u201cresides with any unrelated man without the benefit of marriage\u201d to mean cohabitation. <em>See Frey v. Frey, </em>14 Va.App. 270, 416 S.E.2d 40, 43 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">Because we find that the parties have used a term synonymous with cohabitation in their agreement, we shall interpret the agreement to incorporate the ordinary meaning of \u201ccohabitation,\u201d absent indications to the contrary. 4 S. Williston, A Treatise on the Law of Contracts \u00a7 618, at 705 (W. Jaeger ed., 3d ed. 1961 &amp; 1995 Cum.Supp.). In this case, the parties used the phrase \u201cresides with any unrelated man without the benefit of marriage for a period continuing for beyond sixty (60) consecutive days.\u201d We interpret this language to indicate that the parties modified the definition of the type of cohabitation arrangement that would terminate support to include an additional element beyond the characteristics we outlined in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>Section IV, <em>supra. </em>The parties in this case elected to specify the amount of time a relationship must persist to constitute cohabitation. Parties commonly elect to specify a minimum interval of time to establish cohabitation in support agreements, <em>See, e.g., </em>Turnbull &amp; Wase, <em>supra, </em>at 256, because while courts have generally considered the length or permanency of the relationship in evaluating cohabitation, <em>e.g., Fisher v. Fisher, </em>75 Md.App. 193, 202, 540 A.2d 1165, 1169 (1988), <em>cert. denied, </em>313 Md. 30, 542 A.2d 857 (1988); <em>State v. Kellogg, </em>542 N.W.2d 514, 518 (Iowa 1996), the ordinary meaning of the term does not include any specific time component. The parties did not indicate that time was the only element to be considered in evaluating cohabitation, and thus, we interpret the provision to incorporate the ordinary meaning of the term \u201ccohabitation,\u201d in addition to the sixty-day time requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">We therefore conclude that by using the term \u201cresides with any unrelated man without the benefit of marriage for a period continuing for beyond sixty (60) consecutive days,\u201d the parties encompassed cohabitation arrangements, as defined above, that persist for at least sixty days. In this case, the Domestic Relations Master made no findings regarding any indicia of cohabitation other than the sixty-day time requirement.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Therefore, from the record, it is clear that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>Domestic Relations Master erroneously interpreted the provision to require only proof of a common residence for sixty days. While common residence is a significant factor in establishing cohabitation, it is not dispositive. As the Oregon Supreme Court has stated in a different context, \u201cthe nature of the relationship and not the number of days spent in the same location determines whether cohabitation exists.... \u201d <em>Cottrell v. EBI Cos., </em>304 Or. 187, 743 P.2d 716, 718 (1987) (quoting <em>Bowlin v. SAIF, </em>81 Or.App. 527, 726 P.2d 1186, 1188 (1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">Our interpretation of the parties\u2019 cohabitation provision is also supported by the principle that we should read the contract as a whole. In this case, the contract includes a provision specifying that the parties will lead \u201cseparate lives,\u201d refraining from interference with each other. If the cohabitation clause was interpreted to apply based solely on Mrs. Gordon\u2019s common residence with another man, this might be inconsistent with the \u201cseparate lives\u201d clause, because it would enable Mr. Gordon to exercise inappropriate control over Mrs. Gordon\u2019s post-divorce relationships and sexual conduct. As the parties agreed by incorporating the \u201cseparate lives\u201d clause, \u201c| m]atters of personal preference, residence, or occupation, <em>insofar as they do not reflect changes in income or expenses or other matter of recognized mutual concern, </em>simply are not the business of a former spouse.\u201d <em>Melletz v. Melletz, </em>271 N.J.Super. 359, 366, 638 A.2d 898, 902 (1994) (footnote omitted) (emphasis added), <em>cert. denied, </em>137 N.J. 307, 645 A.2d 136 (1994). Reading the two clauses together supports the view that the cohabitation clause requires more than merely common residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">In addition, cohabitation is only one of a number of conditions in the agreement triggering termination of support. The agreement also provides that support will terminate in the event of the death of either party, remarriage of the wife, or the wife\u2019s reaching retirement age. Each of these conditions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>bears a significant relationship to the parties\u2019 economic circumstances. The agreement also includes a cost of living adjustment to cope with changes in financial circumstance due to inflation. Viewing the agreement in its entirety, therefore, the parties appear to have structured the support payments to respond to changed economic conditions. <em>See Collier v. MD-Individual Practice, </em>327 Md. 1, 5, 607 A.2d 537, 539 (1992) (citing <em>Pacific Indem. v. Interstate Fire &amp; Cas., </em>302 Md. 383, 388, 488 A.2d 486, 488 (1985)).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">Furthermore, although the trial judge recognized the potential public policy implications of the cohabitation clause, he limited his inquiry to whether the cohabitation clause was void as contrary to public policy. Because neither the Master nor the trial court interpreted the clause to require evidence of cohabitation, we shall reverse the Circuit Court\u2019s decision and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">\n<em>JUDGMENT REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS.

Neither Mr. Gordon nor Mrs. Gordon requested modification, and neither party briefed or argued the issue. We leave for another day the question of whether a separation agreement containing language similar to the agreement in this case may be modified by the court. <em>See </em>Md.Code (1984, 1991 Repl.Vol., 1995 Cum.Supp.) \u00a7\u00a7 8-103, 8\u2014105(b), and ll-107(b) of the Family Law Article. <em>See also </em>S.

Although other witnesses were available, including Mr. Shankland, they were not called to testify by either party.

The practice is common, nevertheless, for Courts to incorporate in their decrees provisions as to alimony which have been agreed to by the parties. The Court, however, must be satisfied that the agreement is not the result of collusion on the main point of the divorce.

Although some economic consequence is inevitable from such a relationship, we decline to adopt wife\u2019s suggestion that financial benefit to the supported spouse that <em>permanently </em>affects the need for the decreed spousal support is a prerequisite to a finding of cohabitation.
