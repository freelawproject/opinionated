The controversy, which arose shortly before the 1995 Baltimore City mayoral election, concerned the failure of the Baltimore City Election Board to conduct a purge of inactive voters from its registration rolls. In an action for a declaratory judgment and other relief, the Circuit Court for Baltimore City entered a judgment in favor of the Baltimore City Election Board, and the State Board appealed. This Court granted the State Board\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari and motion for an expedited hearing. After briefing and oral argument, we issued an order on June 16, 1995, affirming the circuit court\u2019s judgment. We now set forth the reasons for our order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-12\">Prior to January 1, 1995, Maryland Code (1957, 1993 Repl. Vol.), Art. 33, \u00a7 3-20, required local election boards to remove <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>annually from voter registration rolls the names of registered voters who had not voted \u201cat least once at a primary, general or special election within the five preceding calendar years.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Former \u00a7 3-20(b) stated that once a voter was removed from the registration rolls for failing to vote within the last five years, that person could not vote until he or she registered again.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-4\">The General Assembly of Maryland in 1994, however, repealed \u00a7 3-20 and enacted Code (1957, 1993 Repl.Vol., 1995 Supp.), Art. 33, \u00a7 17A, effective January 1, 1995. Pursuant to this new statute, a registered voter\u2019s name may be removed from the registration rolls only at the request of the registrant, by reason of a criminal conviction or a guardianship for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>mental disability as provided by State law, on a determination that the registrant has died, or upon a change of address.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Removal because of the failure to vote within the preceding five years is no longer authorized by statute.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1013-4\">In early 1995, a dispute arose between the Baltimore City Election Board and the State Election Board regarding the failure of the local Board to conduct a purge in 1994 of those voters who had not voted in elections during the preceding five years. This omission by the Baltimore City Board, however, was not discovered until January 1995, after the repeal of the Art. 33, \u00a7 3-20. On January 31, 1995, the Attorney General of Maryland advised both election boards that the Baltimore City Board could not lawfully conduct a purge in 1995 because the authority for that action had been repealed. Despite the 1995 repeal of \u00a7 3-20 and the Attorney General\u2019s opinion, the State Board on March 29, 1995, ordered that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>Baltimore City Board conduct a purge of inactive voters.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1014-4\">In response to the State Board\u2019s order, the Baltimore City Board decided to institute a voter verification mail program pursuant to the newly enacted Art. 33, \u00a7 3-17A. Section 3-17A(b) authorizes a local election board to conduct by mail a verification program aimed at removing the names of voters who have become ineligible to vote in the district where they are registered because they have moved outside of the district. In order for the program to be executed, however, a local election board must obtain approval from the State Board. <em>See </em>Code (1957, 1993 Repl.Vol., 1995 Supp.), Art. 33, \u00a7 3-17A(b)(2). In the present case, the State Board rejected the Baltimore City Board\u2019s proposal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-5\">After the State Board\u2019s rejection of the proposed voter verification program, the Baltimore City Board, represented by the Attorney General, filed on May 3, 1995, in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, a complaint for a declaratory judgment and other relief. The plaintiff also filed motions for summary judgment and to expedite the proceedings. Specifically, the Baltimore City Board requested that the State Board\u2019s purge order be declared unlawful in light of the change in the law, and that the State Board be ordered to approve the local Board\u2019s alternative proposal to verify the eligibility of Baltimore City registrants.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-6\">At the conclusion of a hearing on May 23, 1995, the circuit court granted the local Board\u2019s motion for summary judgment and entered a judgment declaring that the March 29, 1995, order of the State Board, directing the Baltimore City Board to conduct a purge, was unlawful because the authority to conduct such purge had been repealed. The court further ordered the State Board to approve the local Board\u2019s proposed mail verification program. In an opinion delivered at the conclusion of the hearing, the circuit court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1015-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>\u201cThe Court has concluded that to order that the voters that haven\u2019t voted in the last five years be stricken from the voter registration rolls of Baltimore City could be violative of ... Article 33, \u00a7 3-17A, and the fact that the city election board failed in its duty to make that purge when it was allowed to make that purge does not deprive the voters of Baltimore City, including or particularly those who haven\u2019t voted in the last five years, of voting in the municipal election in September and November of 1995. There is nothing in the law that I can find that would allow the punishment of the voters for the sins of the [local election] board.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1015-4\">The State Board immediately noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals and thereafter filed in this Court a petition for a writ of certiorari and a motion for expedited consideration.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As previously indicated, we granted the certiorari petition and the motion for expedited consideration. After receiving briefs and hearing oral argument, we affirmed the circuit court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-6\">The State Board contends that the failure of the Baltimore City Board to purge from the voter registration rolls the names of all voters who had not voted between January 1, 1989, and December 31, 1993, must be \u201ccorrected\u201d by undertaking such purge after January 1, 1995, even though the statutory authority to conduct a purge was repealed effective January 1, 1995. The State Board argues that, because the local Board\u2019s omission occurred in 1994, the applicable statutory provision is former Art. 33, \u00a7 3-20, which was in effect in 1994. According to the State Board, to apply the new statute, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>Art. 33, \u00a7 3-17A, would be giving it \u201cretrospective application.\u201d (Appellant\u2019s brief at 11).</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-4\">Furthermore, the State Board maintains that the Baltimore City registered voters who had failed to vote for five years prior to 1994, and who, therefore, should have been purged, are not \u201celigible voters.\u201d (Appellant\u2019s brief at 16). The State Board asserts that the voter registration rolls containing the names of the inactive voters are inaccurate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-5\">Lastly, the State Board argues that, since inactive registered voters in the counties were presumably purged and were required to reregister, Baltimore City registered voters who were inactive during the same period should not be allowed to vote without having had to suffer a purge and to reregister. The State Board maintains that this alleged inequality of treatment between Baltimore City residents and county residents violates both the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the equal protection principle embodied in Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In addition, the State Board asserts that this different treatment is inconsistent with Article I, \u00a7 2, of the Maryland Constitution, providing \u201cfor a uniform Registration of the names of all the voters in this State....\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In the view of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>State Board, equal protection and uniformity principles are infringed by granting \u201cthe right to vote\u201d to \u201c[citizens in Baltimore City who were inactive,\u201d but denying the same right to \u201c[citizens in all jurisdictions other than Baltimore City who failed to vote during the period specified\u201d (Appellant\u2019s brief at 14). The State Board relies on cases which, on equal protection grounds, invalidated statutes applying additional voting qualifications to some citizens but not to others. <em>See Kramer v. Union Free School District, </em>395 U.S. 621, 89 S.Ct. 1886, 23 L.Ed.2d 583 (1969); <em>O.C. Taxpayers for Equal Rights, Inc. v. Mayor and City Council of Ocean City, </em>280 Md. 585, 375 A.2d 541 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-4\">The Baltimore City Board, in addition to disagreeing with the State Board\u2019s position on the merits, argues that the State Board \u201chas no standing ... [to] assert the alleged equal protection rights of\u2019 the individual citizens \u201cwhose rights to equal protection have supposedly been violated by the City Board\u2019s failure to do the purge.\u201d (Appellee\u2019s brief at 16). The local Board invokes the general principle that a litigant is not entitled to assert someone else\u2019s right to equal protection of the laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-6\">Before turning to the merits of the controversy, we shall address the Baltimore City Board\u2019s argument that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>State Board lacks standing to assert the equal protection rights of individual Maryland citizens with regard to voting.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-4\">Of course, \u201cthe general rule is that a person may only assert his own constitutional rights or immunities.\u201d <em>Clark v. State, </em>284 Md. 260, 264, 396 A.2d 243, 246, <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 858, 100 S.Ct. 119, 62 L.Ed.2d 77 (1979) (equal protection challenge to the statute punishing escapes from penal institutions). Nevertheless, the principle that one person is ordinarily not entitled to assert someone else\u2019s right to equal protection of the laws does have exceptions. <em>See, e.g., </em>the discussion in <em>Powers v. Ohio, </em>499 U.S. 400, 410-415, 111 S.Ct. 1364, 1370-1373, 113 L.Ed.2d 411, 425-428 (1991), and cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-5\">Moreover, under the Maryland law of standing, when a litigant has an independent basis for standing to challenge the validity of particular governmental action or inaction, under some circumstances the challenge may include the contention that the governmental action is unconstitutionally discriminatory, even though the challenger is not the person or entity being discriminated against. <em>See State v. Burning Tree Club, Inc., </em>315 Md. 254, 290-293, 554 A.2d 366, 371-373, <em>cert. denied, </em>493 U.S. 816, 110 S.Ct. 66, 107 L.Ed.2d 33 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-6\">In addition, the Legislature may confer a status, powers, or duties upon an official or agency which, in appropriate situations, enables that official or agency to assert the interests or rights of others. <em>See, e.g., Public Service Comm\u2019n v. Md. People\u2019s Counsel, </em>309 Md. 1, 6-10, 522 A.2d 369, 371-373 (1987). In light of the powers and duties conferred upon the State Board by the General Assembly, we believe that the State Board had standing to raise the equal protection and uniformity issues in the context of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-7\">The General Assembly, in Art. 33, \u00a7 1A-I(e), has broadly provided that \u201c[t]he State Administrative Board of Election Laws shall have the following powers and duties, including but not limited to: (1) Exercising supervision over the conduct of elections in the State____\u201d Subsection (2) of the same section authorizes the State Board to adopt rules and regulations \u201cto <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>facilitate compliance by the [local] boards of supervisors of elections with the requirements of this article in the conduct of registrations, voting and elections in the State.... \u201d The remaining subsections of \u00a7 1A-I(e), as well as numerous other provisions of the Election Code, more specifically set forth the State Board\u2019s supervisory authority -with regard to voter registration, approval of \u201cVoting Systems,\u201d voting, absentee ballots, recounts, election records, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-4\">Under Art. 33, \u00a7 1A\u20141(f), the State Board is required to hold meetings with the members of the local boards, and \u201c[i]t is mandatory for those members of the [local] boards, substitute members, the principal administrative officers of the boards and the counsel for the boards who are designated by the State Administrative Board to attend.... \u201d The section goes on to state: \u201cThe purpose of the meetings is to instruct the members of the boards, designated employees and counsel as to their duties in the conduct of elections.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-5\">Consequently, the supervisory authority of the State Board over the local boards is pervasive. If local boards are engaging in acts or omissions in the conduct of voter registration which violate the legal rights of Maryland citizens possessing the qualifications to vote, the State Board clearly has the authority to issue to the local boards lawful orders that will correct the problem. Furthermore, when the propriety of such an order by the State Board is challenged in court, the State Board can certainly defend the order on the ground that the local board\u2019s action or omission resulted in denying legal rights to Maryland citizens.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-6\">In the context of this case, therefore, the State Board had standing to raise the equal protection and uniformity issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-8\">Although the State Board has standing to make the arguments which it advances, those arguments must fail. The order issued to the Baltimore City Board was clearly not a lawful order; it directly contradicted the applicable statutory scheme. Moreover, there is no merit to the State Board\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>attempt to justify its order by contending that the local Board\u2019s application of Art. 33, \u00a7 3-17A is improperly \u201cretrospective,\u201d that the inactive Baltimore City registrants were not \u201celigible\u201d to vote, and that equal protection principles were infringed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-4\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-5\">The State Board\u2019s assertions that \u00a7 3-17A was \u201cretrospectively\u201d applied by the local Board, that the \u201cinactive\u201d Baltimore City registrants were not \u201celigible\u201d voters, and that the local Board\u2019s failure to purge them implicates the fundamental right to vote for purposes of equal protection analysis, seem to be premised upon the theory that being an active or frequent voter was a qualification for voting in 1994. This premise underlying the State Board\u2019s position, however, is flatly erroneous. Being a frequent voter was not, and could not have been, a qualification for voting in 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-6\">The qualifications for voting in Maryland are prescribed in Article I, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 4, of the Maryland Constitution.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In order to vote, one must be a citizen of the United States, eighteen years of age or older, and a resident of Maryland. In addition, the General Assembly may regulate or prohibit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>the right to vote of one convicted of a serious crime or under care or guardianship for mental disability. These prerequisites are the exclusive qualifications for voting in Maryland. <em>See </em>Article 7 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights (\u201cevery citizen having the qualifications prescribed by the Constitution, ought to have the right of suffrage\u201d); <em>Jackson v. Norris, </em>173 Md. 579, 594, 195 A. 576, 584 (1937); <em>Kemp v. Owens, </em>76 Md. 235, 24 A. 606 (1892). <em>See also Board v. Goodsell, </em>284 Md. 279, 283, 396 A.2d 1033, 1035 (1979). Moreover, the General Assembly may neither expand nor curtail the qualifications necessary to vote. <em>See, e.g., Langhammer v. Munter, </em>80 Md. 518, 527, 31 A. 300, 301-302 (1895) (\u201cBut whatever may be done, no restrictions can be imposed that will require other or different qualifications for voting, than those prescribed by the first Article of the Constitution of the State\u201d); <em>Southerland v. Norris, </em>74 Md. 326, 328, 22 A. 137, 137 (1891) (\u201cThese qualifications [for voting in Maryland], fixed by the organic law, can neither be enlarged nor curtailed by the General Assembly\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-4\">Consequently, having voted frequently in the past is not a qualification for voting and, under the Maryland Constitution, could not be a qualification. The \u201cinactive\u201d voters who remained on the registration rolls and who continued to meet the constitutional qualifications for voting in Baltimore City, were not \u201cineligible\u201d voters.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-5\">Contrary to the position of the State Board, former Art. 33, \u00a7 3-20, did not make voting at least once every five years a condition for continued voter eligibility. Instead, the sole purpose of former \u00a7 3-20, as well as present \u00a7 3-17A, was to set forth a procedure or remedy by which election boards could remove from the voter registration rolls the names of persons who had died, moved away, or incurred a voting disability under Article I, \u00a7 4, of the Constitution. <em>See Hoffman v. State of Md., </em>928 F.2d 646, 649 (4th Cir.1991). The repeal of \u00a7 3-20 and the enactment of \u00a7 3-17A in its place effected no change in the qualifications for voting or in any other substantive right. Instead, the General Assembly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>simply decided upon a more narrowly tailored remedy to prevent unqualified persons from voting.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1022-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-5\">Turning specifically to the legality of the State Board\u2019s order in this case, it is clear that the order was unlawful. As of January 1, 1995, and thereafter, no statutory authority existed for the purge ordered by the State Board. The former legal basis for a purge, Art. 33, \u00a7 3-20, had been repealed. New \u00a7 3-17A, enacted in its place, set forth the \u201conly\u201d circumstances under which registered voters\u2019 names could be removed from the voter rolls, and a \u201cpurge\u201d of inactive voters was not one of those circumstances. Section 3-17A was the statute in effect when the State Board issued its order on March 29,1995, and the order was in violation of that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-6\">The State Board\u2019s order to purge inactive voters also was unlawful under Art. 33, \u00a7 3-3, which states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1022-7\">\u201c\u00a7 3-3. Registration to be permanent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1022-8\">\u201cA person registered on June 1, 1957, or at any time thereafter as a qualified voter in the City of Baltimore or in any county shall not be required to register again unless such registration shall be cancelled as hereinafter provided.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1022-9\">At the time of the State Board\u2019s order, a purge of inactive registrants was not a method of registration cancellation \u201cas hereinafter provided.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>Moreover, utilizing in the spring of 1995 the voter verification method authorized by Art. 33, \u00a7 3-17A, was in no sense an improper \u201cretrospective\u201d application of that statute. Section 3-17A, by its terms, applied to voter verification procedures to be employed by election boards from and after the effective date of the statute, which was January 1, 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-4\">As discussed in Part A above, both former \u00a7 3-20 and present \u00a7 3-17A are statutes setting forth remedial procedures enabling election boards to remove from the voter registration rolls the names of persons who have died, moved away, or incurred a voting disability. The repeal of \u00a7 3-20 and the enactment of \u00a7 3-17A changed no substantive rights. A change in procedure or in a remedy, whether administrative or judicial, which does not modify substantive rights, is ordinarily applied to pending matters as well as to all remedial actions taking place after the effective date of the change. <em>See, e.g., Roth v. Dimensions, </em>332 Md. 627, 636-638, 632 A.2d 1170, 1174-1175 (1993); <em>Starfish Condo. v. Yorkridge Serv., </em>295 Md. 693, 705, 458 A.2d 805, 811 (1983); <em>Mraz v. County Comm\u2019rs of Cecil Co., </em>291 Md. 81, 90, 433 A.2d 771, 776-777 (1981); <em>Aviles v. Eshelman Elec. Corp., </em>281 Md. 529, 533, 379 A.2d 1227, 1229 (1977) (\u201cAbsent a contrary intent made mani fest by the enacting authority, any change made by statute ... affecting a remedy only (and consequently not impinging on substantive rights) controls all ... actions whether accrued, pending or future\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-6\">Finally, the Board\u2019s order of March 29, 1995, cannot be justified on an equal protection or uniformity theory. Neither former \u00a7 3-20 nor present \u00a7 3-17A, on their face, authorize different treatment of persons similarly situated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-7\">The failure by Baltimore City administrative election officials in 1994 to comply with the statute then applicable, thereby resulting in different treatment of certain persons, does not itself amount to a constitutional violation under equal protection or uniformity principles. The Supreme Court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>opinion in <em>Snowden v. Hughes, </em>321 U.S. 1, 64 S.Ct. 397, 88 L.Ed. 497 (1944), is directly on point. In <em>Snowden, </em>state election officials, acting in violation of state law, failed to include the petitioner\u2019s name among the successful candidates in the proclamation of primary election results and in issuing certificates of nomination to the successful candidates. Consequently, petitioner asserted that he was deprived of nomination and election as a representative in the state legislature, and he sought damages for an alleged violation of his Fourteenth Amendment right to equal protection of the laws. In rejecting the equal protection claim, Chief Justice Stone explained for the Court (321 U.S. at 8, 64 S.Ct. at 401, 88 L.Ed. at 502-503):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1024-4\">\u201cBut not every denial of a right conferred by state law involves a denial of the equal protection of the laws, even though the denial of the right to one person may operate to confer it on another. Where, as here, a statute requires official action discriminating between a successful and an unsuccessful candidate, the required action is not a denial of equal protection since the distinction between the successful and unsuccessful candidate is based on a permissible classification. And where the official action purports to be in conformity to the statutory classification, an erroneous or mistaken performance of the statutory duty, although a violation of the statute, is not without more a denial of the equal protection of the laws.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1024-5\">\u201cThe unlawful administration by state officers of a state statute fair on its face, resulting in its unequal application to those who are entitled to be treated alike, is not a denial of equal protection unless there is shown to be present in it an element of intentional or purposeful discrimination.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1024-6\">Thus, the mere fact that Baltimore City election officials failed to apply former \u00a7 3-20 in 1994 does not, without more, amount to a constitutional violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-7\">Furthermore, even if it be assumed, <em>arguendo, </em>that the local election officials\u2019 actions in 1994 created an inequality among Maryland citizens in that year which may have violated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>constitutional equal protection principles, the State Board\u2019s order of March 29, 1995, would not have been an appropriate remedy. As pointed out by the circuit court, those citizens of Baltimore City who were qualified and registered voters in 1995, and who could lawfully be removed from the registration rolls only in accordance with new \u00a7 3-17A, should not be punished in 1995, in violation of the Election Code, simply because of an omission by the election officials in 1994. Any violation of state law by election officials, and any resulting violation of equal protection principles, had ceased as of January 1, 1995. The same alleged equal protection violation could not occur in the future because of the statutory changes. Under the circumstances, there was no occasion for any form of prospective or other equitable-type relief. <em>See Green v. Mansour, </em>474 U.S. 64, 106 S.Ct. 423, 88 L.Ed.2d 371 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-5\">The circuit court, therefore, correctly invalidated the State Board\u2019s order of March 29,1995.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1012-5\">.

The impetus for the change in the Maryland Election Code was the enactment by Congress of the National Voter Registration Act of 1993. This federal law generally requires that a state, in addition to its own voter registration methods, provide for voter registration in federal elections through driver's license applications and renewals, through mail-in registration forms, or through voter registration agencies. In addition, the federal law prohibits any state procedure that \u201dresult[s] in the removal of the name of any person from the official list of voters registered to vote in an election for Federal office by reason of the person's failure to vote.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1973gg-6(b)(2). In order to conform to the federal statute, the General Assembly of Maryland enacted \u00a7 3-17A to comply with the federal law, and, at the same time, made \u00a7 3-17A applicable to state, county, and Baltimore City elections. <em>See </em>Ch. 370 of the Acts of 1994.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1014-7\">.

Although the issue was not raised in this case, is not now before us, and is unlikely to be raised in the future in light of the repeal of Art. 33, \u00a7 3-20, the breadth of that former statute might well have presented a substantial issue concerning its validity under Article I, \u00a7 2, of the Maryland Constitution. <em>See </em>note 7, <em>supra. </em>The Attorney General\u2019s office, during the oral argument in the present case, expressed the view that former \u00a7 3-20 was probably in violation of Article I, \u00a7 2.
