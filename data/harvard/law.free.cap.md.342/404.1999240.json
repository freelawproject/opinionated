We shall hold that the Rule does not apply after trial proceedings have commenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-11\">On October 26, 1993, two undercover police officers purchased $20 worth of crack cocaine from a person they later identified as Respondent, Shawn L. Brown. The transaction was videotaped. On November 12, 1993, the officers purchased another $20 worth of crack cocaine from Brown. Following the second sale, Brown was arrested. He was indicted in the Circuit Court for Wicomico County on two counts of distribution of a controlled dangerous substance in violation of Maryland Code (1957, 1992 Repl.Vol., 1995 Cum.Supp.) Article <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>27, \u00a7 286, and two counts of possession of a controlled dangerous substance in violation of Maryland Code (1957, 1992 Repl.Vol., 1995 Supp.) Article 27, \u00a7 287.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">Brown waived his right to a jury and was tried before the court on April 13, 1994. At the beginning of the proceedings, Respondent\u2019s counsel requested a continuance, and advised the court that because he had only been engaged four days before trial, he had insufficient time to prepare. The State objected to the continuance, arguing that only a few days earlier, Respondent\u2019s counsel had indicated he would be ready to go to trial as scheduled. The judge denied the continuance.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">The State called its first witness, but before questioning began, Respondent interrupted to request a jury trial. The court denied the request because Respondent had previously waived his right to jury trial. The State then proceeded to examine the witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-7\">Before the State completed the direct examination of the first witness, Respondent\u2019s counsel indicated that his client wished to discharge him. The judge inquired about the reason for the dismissal, and Respondent\u2019s counsel suggested that the decision was based on his client\u2019s father\u2019s advice. Respondent did not comment, but his father interjected that counsel was unfamiliar with the case. The judge did not permit Respondent to discharge his counsel. <em>See infra </em>Section V.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-8\">The State presented evidence including testimony from the two officers involved in the transaction, the videotape of the transaction, and the crack cocaine. The defense argued mistaken identity, pointing to the fact that the person in the police videotape was clean-shaven, while Respondent had a full beard. Respondent testified that he had grown the beard before the first drug sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>Respondent was convicted on all four counts. At sentencing, Respondent was represented by the same counsel as at trial. Respondent was sentenced to two consecutive terms of ten-year incarceration for the drug distribution charges. The possession convictions were merged for purposes of sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">Respondent noted a timely appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. The intermediate appellate court reversed the judgment of the trial court, holding that the trial judge failed to apply the procedures mandated by Rule 4-215(e) to determine whether Respondent should be allowed to discharge his counsel. <em>Brown v. </em>State, 103 Md.App. 740, 654 A.2d 944 (1995). We granted the State\u2019s petition for certiorari to answer two questions:</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">Did the Court of Special Appeals err in holding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b833-7\">(1) that Maryland Rule 4-215 is applicable once trial has</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b833-8\">commenced; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b833-9\">(2) that the trial court did not properly comply with subsection (e) of the Rule in this case?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b833-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-11\">The State contends that Rule 4-215 does not apply once trial begins. The State argues that Rule 4-215(e) applies only to efforts to discharge counsel made prior to trial or at the beginning of the trial. Respondent did not indicate a desire to discharge his counsel until the State had commenced its casein-chief. Therefore, the State argues that Rule 4-215(e) did not apply. Alternatively, the State argues that even if Rule 4-215(e) applied, the trial court\u2019s inquiry sufficed to meet the requirements of the Rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-12\">Respondent contends that Rule 4-215(e) applies to all decisions to discharge counsel, regardless of when they are made. Therefore, Respondent argues, the trial court was required to satisfy the procedural requirements of 4-215(e). In the alternative, Respondent maintains that even if the formal requirements of Rule 4-215(e) did not apply, the trial court abused its discretion by failing to identify and consider the reason Re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>spondent wished to discharge his counsel before deciding <em>not </em>to allow the dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">In this case, we must consider the interplay between two constitutional rights and the procedural rule that is designed to implement those rights. Maryland Rule 4-215 is designed to protect both the right to assistance of counsel and the right to pro se defense provided by the Sixth Amendment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Leonard v. State, </em>302 Md. 111, 121-22, 486 A.2d 163, 168 (1985). As we shall explain <em>infra, once </em>meaningful trial proceedings have begun, the right to substitute counsel and the right to defend pro se are curtailed to prevent undue interference with the administration of justice. <em>Fowlkes v. State, </em>311 Md. 586, 605-06, 536 A.2d 1149, 1159 (1988). Thus, once trial begins, exercise <em>of </em>these rights is subject to the trial court\u2019s discretion. Rule 4-215 is designed to ensure that courts comply with constitutional requirements in advising defendants of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel. The Rule is not intended to deprive the courts of discretion regarding motions to discharge counsel after trial has commenced. We therefore conclude that the Rule is inapposite once trial is underway. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-7\">A. <em>Constitutional Implications of Defendant\u2019s Dismissal of Counsel</em></p>\n<p id=\"b834-8\">A defendant\u2019s request to dismiss appointed counsel implicates two rights that are fundamental to our system of criminal justice: the defendant\u2019s right to counsel, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>defendant\u2019s right to self-representation. <em>See Moten v. State, </em>339 Md. 407, 663 A.2d 593 (1995); <em>Parren v. State, </em>309 Md. 260, 523 A.2d 597 (1987); <em>Snead v. State, </em>286 Md. 122, 406 A.2d 98 (1979). <em>See also McKaskle v. Wiggins, </em>465 U.S. 168, 104 S.Ct. 944, 79 L.Ed.2d 122 (1984); <em>Faretta v. California, </em>422 U.S. 806, 95 S.Ct. 2525, 45 L.Ed.2d 562 (1975); <em>Gideon v. Wainwright, </em>372 U.S. 335, 83 S.Ct. 792, 9 L.Ed.2d 799 (1963). When a defendant indicates a desire to dismiss counsel, the defendant must request permission to obtain substitute counsel or to proceed pro se. The trial court\u2019s subsequent procedures depend on whether the defendant requests substitute counsel or self-representation. (\u201c[I]t is the relief requested (self-representation) and not the reasons underlying the motion (dissatisfaction with counsel) which governs the trial court\u2019s responsibilities when considering such motions.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">If the defendant requests dismissal of counsel in order to obtain substitute counsel, the court must afford the defendant an opportunity to explain the reasons for the proposed dismissal. <em>See United States v. Allen, </em>789 F.2d 90, 92 (1st Cir.1986), <em>cert. denied, </em>479 U.S. 846, 107 S.Ct. 164, 93 L.Ed.2d 103 (1986); <em>United States v. Welty, </em>674 F.2d 185, 190 (3d Cir.1982). While an indigent defendant is entitled to appointed counsel, the defendant is not entitled to choose a specific attorney. <em>See Fowlkes, </em>311 Md. at 605-06, 536 A.2d at 1159; <em>cf. Grandison v. State, </em>341 Md. 175, 199-204, 670 A.2d 398, 410-11 (1995). Instead, the defendant is entitled to the effective assistance of counsel, and may only obtain substitute counsel for \u201cgood cause.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See Fowlkes, </em>311 Md. at 605-06, 536 A.2d at 1159. <em>See also United States v. Gallop, </em>838 F.2d 105, 108 (4th Cir.1988), <em>cert. denied, </em>487 U.S. 1211, 108 S.Ct. 2858, 101 L.Ed.2d 895 (1988); <em>Allen, </em>789 F.2d at 92.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>If the defendant requests dismissal of counsel in order to proceed pro se, and if the proposal to discharge counsel is timely and unequivocal, the court must ordinarily grant the request. <em>Faretta, </em>422 U.S. at 833-34, 95 S.Ct. at 2540-41. By choosing self-representation, the defendant forgoes the right to counsel. Therefore, the court must conduct a waiver inquiry to ensure that any decision to waive the right to counsel is \u201cmade with eyes open.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 835, 95 S.Ct. at 2541 (quoting <em>Adams v. United States ex rel. McCann, </em>317 U.S. 269, 279, 63 S.Ct. 236, 242, 87 L.Ed. 268 (1943)). The Sixth Amendment requires that the defendant\u2019s waiver of the right to counsel must be \u201cknowing and intelligent.\u201d <em>Johnson v. Zerbst, </em>304 U.S. 458, 464-65, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 1023, 82 L.Ed. 1461 (1938). <em>See also </em>1 American Bar Ass\u2019n, ABA Standards on Criminal Justice 6-38 to 6-41 (2d ed. 1986) (Special Functions of the Trial Judge Standard 6-3.6, Defendant\u2019s Election to Represent Himself or Herself at Trial). Although courts have recognized several exceptions to the <em>Faretta </em>rule, these exceptions have been narrowly construed to effectuate the defendant\u2019s right to self-representation. <em>Cf. Leonard, </em>302 Md. at 127, 486 A.2d at 171. Absent a recognized exception, refusal to grant a timely, unequivocal request for self-representation is reversible error. <em>See Snead, </em>286 Md. at 130, 406 A.2d at 102. <em>See also McKaskle, </em>465 U.S. at 177 n. 8, 104 S.Ct. at 950 n. 8; <em>People v. Davis, </em>49 N.Y.2d 114, 424 N.Y.S.2d 372, 375-76, 400 N.E.2d 313, 317 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">B. <em>Limitation of the Right to Dismiss Counsel After Trial Begins</em></p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">While we have recognized the importance of the right to dismiss counsel, we have also concluded that at some point after trial begins, the right to defend pro se and the right to obtain substitute counsel must be limited to prevent undue interference with the administration of justice. <em>Fowlkes, </em>311 Md. at 605, 536 A.2d at 1159. <em>See also United States v. Dunlap, </em>577 F.2d 867, 868 (4th Cir.1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 858, 99 S.Ct. 174, 58 L.Ed.2d 166 (1978). In the absence of such a limitation, defendants could use \u201celeventh hour\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>requests to discharge counsel as a tactic to delay the proceedings or to confuse the jury. <em>See, e.g., State v. Sheppard, </em>172 W.Va. 656, 310 S.E.2d 173, 187 (1983); <em>Dunlap, </em>577 F.2d at 868-69.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">In order to justify substitution of counsel after trial begins, the defendant must demonstrate good cause. <em>McKee v. Harris, </em>649 F.2d 927, 931 (2d Cir.1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>456 U.S. 917, 102 S.Ct. 1773, 72 L.Ed.2d 177 (1982) (good cause may include a \u201cconflict of interest, a complete breakdown of communication or an irreconcilable conflict which leads to an apparently unjust verdict.\u201d). <em>See also Fowlkes, </em>311 Md. at 605-06, 536 A.2d at 1159. The decision whether to permit mid-trial substitution of counsel is left to the trial court\u2019s discretion. <em>See Commonwealth v. Chavis, </em>415 Mass. 703, 616 N.E.2d 423, 428 (1993); <em>Commonwealth v. Miskel, </em>364 Mass. 783, 308 N.E.2d 547, 552 (1974). As the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court has stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-6\">It is now well established by decisions of this court and of the [fjederal courts that a defendant\u2019s freedom to change his counsel is restricted on the commencement of trial. \u201cOnce the trial had begun, the effectiveness of any right of the defendant to force a change of counsel was diminished.... Thereafter any prejudice to his interests was to be balanced with the foreseeable effect upon the trial already in progress. Upon this issue the decision must be largely within the discretion of the trial judge[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b837-7\"><em>Miskel, </em>308 N.E.2d at 552 (citations omitted) (quoting <em>Lamoureux v. Commonwealth, </em>353 Mass. 556, 233 N.E.2d 741, 744 (1968)). <em>See also United States v. Michelson, </em>559 F.2d 567, 572 (9th Cir.1977); <em>United States v.

If the court concludes that the defendant\u2019s request to dismiss counsel was \u201cnot made in good faith but [was] a transparent ploy for delay,\u201d the court may exercise its discretion to deny the request. <em>Morris v. Slappy, </em>461 U.S. 1, 13, 103 S.Ct. 1610, 1617, 75 L.Ed.2d 610 (1983). Furthermore, tactical disagreements short of a total breakdown in communication between attorney and client generally do not warrant mid-trial substitution of counsel. <em>See Miskel, </em>308 N.E.2d at 552; <em>see also Morris, </em>461 U.S. at 13, 103 S.Ct. at 1617 (rejecting the view that the defendant is entitled to a \u201cmeaningful attorney-client relationship\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">Frequently, denial of a defendant\u2019s request for substitute counsel leads to a request to defend pro se.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>See, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>e.g., <em>Snead, </em>286 Md. at 126, 406 A.2d at 100; <em>see also Taylor v. State, 557 </em>So.2d 138, 140 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1990). Although the request to proceed pro se ordinarily should be granted if asserted unequivocally before trial, the right to proceed pro se is limited after trial has begun. <em>See, e.g., Bassette v. Thompson, </em>915 F.2d 932, 941 (4th Cir.1990), <em>cert. denied, </em>499 U.S. 982, 111 S.Ct. 1639, 113 L.Ed.2d 734 (1991); <em>United States v.

Thus, if a defendant does not timely assert the right to proceed pro se, the decision to grant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>the request is also left to the sound discretion of the trial court.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">Although we have not previously addressed this issue, the Court of Special Appeals has reached a similar conclusion in several decisions.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>See Ross v. </em>State, 53 Md.App. 397, 453 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>A.2d 828 (1983); <em>Johnson v.

State, </em>53 Md.App. 397, 453 A.2d 828 (1983), the defendant was represented by counsel throughout the trial, but indicated a desire to deliver the closing argument himself after all the evidence was presented. <em>Id. </em>at 398, 453 A.2d at 829. The trial court denied the request, and the Court of Special Appeals affirmed the decision. The intermediate appellate court distinguished other cases where the \u201crequest by the accused to represent himself came prior to the beginning of the trial\u201d and concluded that there was \u201cno abuse of the trial judge\u2019s judicial discretion in his denial of the appellant\u2019s request to give his closing argument to the jury pro se.\u201d 53 Md.App. at 401, 453 A.2d at 830-31.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">In <em>Johnson v. State, </em>44 Md.App. 515, 411 A.2d 118 (1980), at the conclusion of the State\u2019s evidence, defense counsel indicated that the defendant wished to discharge him. <em>Id. </em>at 521, 411 A.2d at 122. The court denied the request, and the Court of Special Appeals affirmed. Although the intermediate appellate court found that the defendant did not \u201cclearly and unequivocally\u201d indicate a desire to represent himself, the court also stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b841-6\"><em>Faretta v.

State, </em>266 Ind. 250, 362 N.E.2d at 147, the Supreme Court of Indiana addressed two related discharge of counsel issues. First, on the day before trial, after the defendant had been represented by counsel for a number of months, he requested permission to hire substitute counsel. The trial court denied defendant\u2019s request for a continuance to hire substitute counsel. The appellate court concluded that this decision was not an abuse of discretion, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>because although the defendant had a constitutional right to an attorney of his choice if he could afford to employ one,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b843-5\">the right can only embrace a reasonable opportunity to obtain such representation, and we find no denial of such opportunity. Trial was imminent; the defendant had had prior continuances for such purpose, and the trial date had been determined three months earlier. Appointed counsel was prepared and ready. There was no claim of any lack of opportunity ... The [decision not to] grant[ ] a continuance ... was within the sound discretion of the trial court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b843-6\"><em>Id. </em>362 N.E.2d at 147. <em>Accord People v.

A trial court\u2019s denial of a defendant\u2019s request to substitute counsel will not be overturned absent an abuse of discretion.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-7\">At trial during the State\u2019s case-in-chief, the defendant in <em>Works </em>requested leave to personally cross-examine several witnesses. The trial court denied the request. The Indiana Supreme Court affirmed, stating that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b843-8\">The right of a defendant in a criminal case to act as his own lawyer is unqualified if evoked prior to the start of the trial ... Once the trial has begun with the defendant represented by counsel, however, his right thereafter to discharge his lawyer and to represent himself is sharply curtailed.

In <em>Gallop, </em>the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b844-5\">The determination of whether or not the motion for substitution of counsel should be granted is within the discretion of the trial court and the court is entitled to take into account the countervailing state interest in proceeding on schedule.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b844-6\">In evaluating whether the trial court abused its discretion in denying the defendant\u2019s motion for substitution of counsel, the First and Ninth Circuits have held that the appellate courts should consider the following facts: Timeliness of the motion; adequacy of the court\u2019s inquiry into the defendant\u2019s complaint; and whether the attorney/client conflict was so great that it had resulted in total lack of communication preventing an adequate defense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b844-7\">838 F.2d at 108 (citations omitted).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b844-8\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-9\">Courts differ on the exact point in time when the right to discharge counsel is curtailed. Some courts have held, for example, that requests to proceed pro se are <em>per se </em>untimely if asserted after the jury has been selected. <em>See Denno, </em>348 F.2d at 16. Other jurisdictions have established impanelment of the jury as the \u201ccut-off\u2019 point. <em>See, e.g., Fritz v.

State, </em>302 Md. 111, 122, 486 A.2d 163, 168 (1985); <em>see also Parren v. State, </em>309 Md. 260, 277-78, 523 A.2d 597, 605 (1987). The Rule ensures that decisions to discharge counsel comport with constitutional requirements. <em>See Fowlkes, </em>311 Md. at 606, 536 A.2d at 1159; <em>Parren, </em>309 Md. at 280, 523 A.2d at 606-06; <em>Leonard, </em>302 Md. at 122, 486 A.2d at 168. In this case, we are asked to consider whether the procedural requirements of Rule 4-215 apply only to decisions to dismiss counsel made prior to trial or at the beginning of trial, or if the Rule also applies after trial has begun. This is an issue of first impression.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b847-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>With regard to a defendant\u2019s right to discharge counsel, Rule 4-215(e) provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b847-5\">If a defendant requests permission to discharge an attorney whose appearance has been entered, the court shall permit the defendant to explain the reasons for the request. If the court finds that there is a meritorious reason for the defendant\u2019s request, the court shall permit the discharge of counsel; continue the action if necessary; and advise the defendant that if new counsel does not enter an appearance by the next scheduled trial date, the action will proceed to trial with the defendant unrepresented by counsel. If the court finds no meritorious reason for the defendant\u2019s request, the court may not permit the discharge of counsel without first informing the defendant that the trial will proceed as scheduled with the defendant unrepresented by counsel if the defendant discharges counsel and does not have new counsel. If the court permits the defendant to discharge counsel, it shall comply with subsections (a)(1)\u2014(4) of this Rule if the docket or file does not reflect prior compliance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">The Rule creates a three-step process for discharge of counsel. First, when the defendant indicates a desire to dismiss counsel, the court must provide an opportunity for the defendant to explain the reason for dismissal. Second, the court must evaluate the reason to determine if it is meritorious. If the reason is meritorious, the court must permit dismissal, continue the case if necessary, and warn the defendant that he or she may be required to proceed pro se if new counsel is not engaged by the next trial date. If the reason for dismissal is not meritorious, however, the court must engage in a third-level inquiry. The court may still permit dismissal of counsel, but only after warning the defendant of the possibility he or she will proceed pro se if substitute counsel is not secured. The court may also reject the defendant\u2019s request to dismiss counsel if the reason is not meritorious.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-7\">When the court permits a defendant to discharge counsel, other provisions of Rule 4-215 will also be triggered. First, the court must satisfy the procedural requirements of Rule 4-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>215(a)(1)\u2014(4), <em>i.e., </em>(1) ensure that the defendant received the charging document including notice of the right to counsel; (2) inform the defendant of the right to counsel and its importance; (3) advise the defendant of the nature of the charges and the possible penalties; and (4) conduct a waiver inquiry as provided by Rule 4-215(b) if the defendant wishes to proceed pro se. Under part (b), the court must determine that any decision to waive the right to counsel is \u201cknowing and voluntary,\u201d in accord with the standard articulated by the Supreme Court in <em>Johnson v. Zerbst, </em>304 U.S. 458, 464-65, 58 S. Ct. 1019, 1023, 82 L.Ed. 1461 (1938).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">As explained in Section III.B, <em>supra, </em>the right to substitute counsel and the right to self-representation are, of necessity, curtailed once trial begins. After meaningful trial proceedings have commenced, the decision to permit the defendant to exercise either right must be committed to the sound discretion of the trial court. Once trial begins, therefore, Rule 4-215 no longer governs, although the court must still adhere to constitutional standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">Furthermore, the history of Rule 4-215 supports our conclusion that the Rule does not apply after trial begins. The original rule regarding waiver of the right to counsel was Rule 719, which stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b848-7\">If, <em>at any stage of the proceeding, </em>an accused indicates a desire or inclination to waive representation, the court shall not permit such a waiver unless it determines, after appropriate questioning in open court, that the accused fully comprehends: (i) the nature of the charges and any lesser-included offenses, the range of allowable punishments, and that counsel may be of assistance to him in determining whether there may be defenses to the charges or circumstances in mitigation thereof; (ii) that the right to counsel includes the right to the prompt assignment of an attorney without charge to the accused, if he is financially unable to obtain private counsel; (iii) that even if the accused intends to plead guilty, counsel may be of substantial value in developing and presenting material which could affect the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>sentences; and (iv) that among the accused\u2019 s rights at trial are the right to call witnesses in his behalf, the right to confront and cross-examine witnesses, the right to obtain witnesses by compulsory process, and the right to require proof of the charges beyond a reasonable doubt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b849-4\">(emphasis added).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Rule 719 was amended and renumbered as Rule 723; Rule 723 was subsequently redesignated as Rule 3-305, and later as Rule 4-215. <em>Leonard, </em>302 Md. at 122 n. 2, 486 A.2d at 168 n. 2. The current rule, 4-215, omits the \u201cat any stage of the proceedings\u201d language from the original rule. By omitting this phrase, it is clear to us that the procedural requirements of 4-215 were not intended to apply in every situation where a defendant waived counsel. The focus of the Rule was progressively narrowed to concentrate on early-stage decisions to dismiss counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">In addition, requiring trial courts to adhere to the Rule throughout trial would present unnecessary and cumbersome procedural obstacles to an efficient trial. For example, if Rule 4- 215(e) applied throughout the trial, it would require the court to permit dismissal of counsel if the defendant could demonstrate a meritorious reason, regardless of any countervailing considerations. This interpretation would increase the risk of disruption and jury confusion, consequently increasing the risk of mistrial. Moreover, this view would be contrary to the overwhelming weight of authority, which supports allowing trial courts the discretion to determine whether discharge of counsel should be permitted during trial.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> For all of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>foregoing reasons, we hold that Rule 4-215 applies up to and including the beginning of trial, but not after meaningful trial proceedings have begun.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-6\">Although we conclude that Rule 4\u2014215(e) does not apply to decisions to discharge counsel after trial has begun, the trial court must determine the reason for the requested discharge before deciding whether dismissal should be allowed. While the trial court has broad discretion, once trial has begun, to determine whether dismissal of counsel is warranted, the court\u2019s discretion is not limitless. The court must conduct an inquiry to assess whether the defendant\u2019s reason for dismissal of counsel justifies any resulting disruption. This inquiry must meet constitutional standards. <em>See, e.g., Johnson v. Zerbst, </em>304 U.S. 458, 464-65, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 1023, 82 L.Ed. 1461 (1938).</p>\n<p id=\"b850-7\">We acknowledge that there is little to guide the trial judge in the exercise of this discretion. Therefore, in future proceedings, we suggest that the trial judge consider the following factors in deciding whether to permit discharge of counsel during trial: (1) the merit of the reason for discharge; (2) the quality of counsel\u2019s representation prior to the request; (3) the disruptive effect, if any, that discharge would have on the proceedings; (4) the timing of the request; (5) the complexity and stage of the proceedings; and (6) any prior requests by the defendant to discharge counsel. <em>See Sapienza v. Vincent, </em>534 F.2d 1007, 1010 (2d Cir.1976); <em>People v. Cummings, </em>4 Cal.4th 1233, 18 Cal.Rptr.2d 796, 850 P.2d 1, 57 (1993), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 114 S.Ct. 1576, 128 L.Ed.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>219 (1994); <em>People v. Windham, </em>19 Cal.3d 121, 137 Cal.Rptr. 8, 560 P.2d 1187, 1191-92 (1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 848, 98 S.Ct. 157, 54 L.Ed.2d 116 (1977). Generally, the longer the defendant waits to request discharge of counsel, the stronger the rationale must be to warrant counsel\u2019s dismissal. In evaluating trial court decisions on motions to dismiss counsel during trial, we shall apply an abuse of discretion standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">In this case, Respondent requested permission to dismiss his counsel after the State had presented evidence in the case-in chief. Under the circumstances of this case, we conclude that meaningful trial proceedings had commenced. Rule 4-215 therefore did not apply, and the decision to permit dismissal of counsel was committed to the trial court\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-7\">The record reflects only a superficial inquiry by the trial judge into the reasons for Respondent\u2019s request:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b851-8\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Judge, may I interject for a moment? I don\u2019t mean\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b851-9\">[THE COURT]: ... we have certain procedures\u2014 [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I know we do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b851-10\">[THE COURT]: You will have an opportunity to be heard. [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: It has nothing to do with being heard.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b851-11\">[THE COURT]: What is it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b851-12\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: My client wishes to dismiss me at this point in time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b851-13\">[THE COURT]: For what reasons?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b851-14\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I guess on the advice of his father.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b851-15\">[DEFENDANT\u2019S FATHER]: You can\u2019t represent him. You don\u2019t know nothing about his case, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b851-16\">[THE COURT]: We are in the middle of the trial. We will proceed. Go ahead.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b851-17\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Am I\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>[THE COURT]: You are still counsel, yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">As indicated by this brief colloquy, the trial judge did not determine whether defendant was attempting to assert his right to proceed pro se or asking the court to appoint substitute counsel. Although the court may consider similar factors, regardless of which form of relief the defendant desired, the court should have made this basic determination at the outset. <em>See supra </em>note 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-6\">Once defense counsel advised the court of Respondent\u2019s desire to discharge him, the court was required to afford Respondent an opportunity to explain the reasons for his request. The exchange between the court and defense counsel demonstrates that the trial judge did not provide an opportunity for Respondent to explain his desire to discharge counsel. Defense counsel\u2019s speculation that Respondent\u2019s request was based on the \u201cadvice of his father\u201d does not provide an adequate explanation of Respondent\u2019s reasons. It is Respondent\u2019s reply, not that of his father, that ordinarily would be relevant to determine whether or not the discharge should be permitted, because the right to counsel and the right to self-representation are personal rights. <em>See Faretta, </em>422 U.S. at 819, 95 S.Ct. at 2533. Furthermore, the father\u2019s view on whether counsel should be discharged may not be imputed to Respondent. The trial court was obligated to inquire further into the substance of Respondent\u2019s dissatisfaction with his counsel.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b853-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>The State asserts that the trial court\u2019s refusal to permit dismissal was not an abuse of discretion because Respondent never personally explained the reasons for his request to discharge counsel. The onus, however, is not on Respondent to interrupt a discussion between the court and his attorney to offer an explanation, but rather the responsibility is on the trial judge to ensure that the reason for requesting dismissal of counsel is explained. <em>See People v. Marsden, </em>2 Cal.3d 118, 84 Cal.Rptr. 156, 465 P.2d 44, 47-48 (1970). Although the trial judge need not engage in a full-scale inquiry pursuant to Rule 4-215, the judge must at least consider the defendant\u2019s reason for requesting dismissal before rendering a decision.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We conclude that the trial judge abused his discretion by failing to consider the defendant\u2019s reason for seeking to dismiss counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED.

State, 673 </em>S.W.2d 578 (Tex.Crim.App.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">Some courts have suggested that the standard for evaluating requests to defend pro se should be more permissive than the standard for evaluating requests for substitute counsel. <em>Blankenship, </em>673 S.W.2d at 585. For example, in <em>Blankenship, </em>the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b840-7\">While this court has held that the accused may not wait until the day of trial to demand <em>different </em>counsel or to request that counsel be <em>dismissed </em>so that he may <em>retain </em>other counsel where this results in a delay of the proceedings, ... such is not the situation in the case at bar. Appellant neither demanded the appointment of different counsel nor did he ask that his attorney be dismissed so that he could retain other counsel. He merely asserted his constitutional right to represent himself at trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b840-8\"><em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). In this case, because the trial court did not determine whether the defendant sought substitute counsel or pro se defense, we need not reach the issue of whether the standards differ.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b840-9\">. We considered a related but distinct issue in <em>Leonard v. State, </em>302 Md. 111, 486 A.2d 163 (1985). In <em>Leonard, </em>on the day of trial prior to jury selection, the defendant requested substitute counsel, and the trial court denied the request. <em>Id. </em>at 114, 486 A.2d at 164. After <em>voir dire </em>of the prospective jurors had been completed but before the parties presented opening statements, the defendant requested permission to defend pro se. <em>Id. </em>at 115-16, 486 A.2d at 165-66. The trial court granted the request. <em>Id., </em>486 A.2d at 165-66. On appeal following his conviction, Leonard argued that the trial court should have conducted a waiver inquiry pursuant to Maryland Rule 723 (a precursor of Rule 4-215) when he asserted his <em>Faretta </em>right. We concluded that the trial court should have conducted a waiver inquiry pursuant to Rule 723, and that the failure to do so constituted reversible error. <em>Id. </em>at 129, 486 A.2d at 172.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-10\"><em>Leonard </em>is distinguishable from the instant case, however, because the trial court found that the defendant in <em>Leonard </em>had <em>timely </em>asserted his right to defend pro se. Leonard asserted his <em>Faretta </em>right before opening statements, while in this case, Brown did not attempt to discharge counsel until after the State began to present evidence. As stated in Section III.A, <em>supra, </em>if the right to defend pro se is asserted in a timely and unequivocal fashion, the request ordinarily should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>granted absent exceptional circumstances. <em>See Fowlkes, </em>311 Md. at 589, 536 A.2d at 1151. When the <em>Faretta </em>right is timely asserted, Rule 4-215 applies; however, as we shall explain <em>infra, </em>in the present case, the right was not timely asserted. <em>See infra </em>Section V.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b844-10\">. Although defense counsel in <em>Gallop </em>indicated that his relationship with the defendant had \"entirely broken down,\" the court concluded that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in denying the request to substitute counsel, because the court had conducted an adequate inquiry, and because the record did not indicate a \"total lack of communication.\u201d 838 F.2d at 109.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b845-7\">. As the California Supreme Court noted in Windham, the timeliness requirement \u201cmust not be used as a means of limiting a defendant\u2019s <em>constitutional </em>right of self-representation.\u201d 137 Cal.Rptr. at 12 n. 5, 560 P.2d at 1191 n. 5. The requirement is only designed to prevent the defendant from \u201cunjustifiably delaying] a scheduled trial or ... obstructing] the orderly administration of justice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The <em>Windham </em>court thus provided for some exceptions to the timeliness rule, stating that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b845-8\">There may be other situations in which a request for self-representation in close proximity to trial can be justified. When the lateness of the request and even the necessity of a continuance can be reasonably justified, the request should be granted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b845-9\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b846-7\">. Although some dicta in our earlier decisions relate to timing, we have never before addressed the precise issue presented in this case. For example, in <em>Fowlkes v. State, </em>311 Md. 586, 536 A.2d 1149 (1988), we said that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b846-8\">An accused who, <em>at or shortly before trial </em>and without justification, insists on discharging his counsel and demands the appointment of new counsel, may properly be deemed to have waived his right to counsel if he is sufficiently informed in accordance with rule 4-215 so that his discharge of counsel represents knowing, intelligent, and voluntary action on his part.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b846-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 604, 536 A.2d at 1158 (emphasis added). Although the \"at or shortly before trial\u201d language in <em>Fowlkes </em>might be interpreted to suggest that Rule 4-215 applies throughout trial, <em>Fowlkes </em>did not address this issue. Instead, <em>Fowlkes </em>held that under Rule 4-215(e) \"a defendant\u2019s unmeritorious refusal to proceed with current counsel may constitute a waiver of the right to counsel, provided the defendant acts knowingly and intelligently.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 606, 536 A.2d at 1159. <em>See also Snead v. State, </em>286 Md. 122, 132-33 &amp; n. 7, 406 A.2d 98, 103 &amp; n. 7 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b846-10\">In <em>Williams </em>v. <em>State, </em>321 Md. 266, 582 A.2d 803 (1990), we also addressed application of Rule 4-215. We held that where a defendant indicates a desire to dismiss counsel at the outset of the trial, the court's failure to inquire about the reason for the dismissal as required by 4-215(e) constitutes reversible error. <em>Id. </em>at 274, 582 A.2d at 807. In this case, unlike <em>Williams, </em>however, the defendant's request to discharge counsel occurred after trial commenced.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b849-8\">. The same language was used in Maryland District Rule 726(a), which required a full-scale waiver inquiry whenever \"a defendant appears in court at any stage of a criminal proceeding, including a preliminary hearing, and is not represented by counsel....\u201d <em>See Green </em>v. <em>State, </em>286 Md. 692, 695, 410 A.2d 234, 236 (1980). Rule 4-215(c) is in part derived from Rule 726.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b849-9\">. By our interpretation of Rule 4-215, however, we do not suggest that defendant's right to counsel is in any way diminished after trial begins; unquestionably, a defendant has the right to effective assistance of counsel throughout trial. We merely recognize the widely accepted limitation on the defendant\u2019s right to obtain substitute counsel after trial commences. Although a defendant may allege a reason for dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>missal with some merit, such as a personal conflict with counsel that interferes with attorney/client communication, this may not warrant substitution of counsel after trial is underway. <em>See State v. Sheppard, </em>172 W.Va. 656, 310 S.E.2d 173, 185-86 (1983). Furthermore, such an interpersonal conflict would rarely amount to constitutionally \"ineffective assistance\u201d that would deprive the defendant of the right to assistance of counsel. Thus, the decision to permit substitution of counsel is properly left to the trial court\u2019s discretion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b852-7\">. Based on the limited record and Respondent\u2019s prior motion for a continuance, we infer that the crux of defendant\u2019s father's complaint was counsel's inadequate preparation. We can not determine from the record whether the trial court treated this as the basis for its decision, rejecting the motion based on counsel\u2019s performance up to that point in the proceedings. As the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit stated in <em>United States v. Welty, </em>674 F.2d 185 (3d Cir.1982):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Arq\">It is vital that the ... court take particular pains in discharging its responsibility to conduct these inquiries concerning substitution of counsel and waiver of counsel. <em>Perfunctory questioning is not sufficient </em>[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b852-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 187 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b852-9\">Furthermore, although the trial court need not state all its reasons for denying defendant\u2019s request to discharge counsel,the better practice is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>for the trial court to provide a sufficient rationale for its denial of substitution or pro se defense on the record to facilitate appellate review. <em>See, e.g., Lyons v. State, </em>106 Nev. 438, 796 P.2d 210, 214-15 (1990); <em>People v. Windham, </em>19 Cal.3d 121, 137 Cal.Rptr. 8, 560 P.2d 1187, 1192 &amp; n. 6 (1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 848, 98 S.Ct. 157, 54 L.Ed.2d 116 (1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b853-7\">. Although the record does not reflect an unequivocal assertion of the right to defend pro se, the defendant might have articulated such a request if the trial judge had properly proceeded to explore the reasons for dismissing counsel. Because we conclude the trial court's failure to make this inquiry constituted an abuse of discretion, however, we need not reach the issue of whether Brown unequivocally asserted his <em>Faretta </em>right.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
