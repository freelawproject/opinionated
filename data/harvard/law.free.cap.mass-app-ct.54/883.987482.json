After their break-up, Gallagher authored a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>poem with some violent imagery that expressed his emotional upheaval.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The poem (which appears as an Appendix to this opinion) came into Jones\u2019s possession and she, expressing fear for her safety, requested an ex parte abuse prevention order pursuant to G. L. c. 209A against Gallagher on August 6, 1998. Following a hearing, a one-year abuse prevention order was entered by a District Court judge on September 24, 1998, and upon its expiration, on September 23, 1999, a second judge entered a permanent order against Gallagher, from which he now appeals. He claims that the second judge erroneously placed the burden of proof on him and that the evidence was insufficient to make the order permanent.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>The 1998 order was published on the standard form entitled \u201cAbuse Prevention Order.\u201d Findings were recorded by checking off the boxes that correspond to the preprinted text. Gallagher was ordered \u201cnot to abuse the plaintiff,\u201d \u201cnot to contact the plaintiff,\u201d and to \u201cstay away from the plaintiff\u2019s residence\u201d and workplace. The box reciting \u201c[tjhere is a substantial likelihood of immediate danger of abuse\u201d was also checked. The order notified the defendant that \u201c[vjiolation of this order is a criminal offense punishable by imprisonment or fine or both.\u201d The order recites an expiration date, as well as the \u201cnext hearing date,\u201d of September 23, 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-6\">On that date, Gallagher, his counsel, and Jones were present. The proceeding was brief and informal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At the proceeding, the judge remarked that \u201c[tjhere have been extensive hearings apparently on this matter in which exhibits and testimony were taken,\u201d and then asked, \u201cHow have things been since the order went into effect?\u201d Jones replied, \u201cOK,\u201d and upon the judge\u2019s inquiry, stated, \u201cFd like to have the order made permanent.\u201d There was no other proof or offer of proof. The judge then invited Gallagher\u2019s attorney to speak, whereupon counsel recited that the parties had experienced a personal relationship that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>started \u201cwhen they both were married,\u201d and lasted for approximately two and one-half years. The relationship ended one and one-half years before the initial order was granted, and the order had been issued on the basis of a poem \u201cthat Mr. Gallagher had written about his own pain [using] imagery that was violent in terms of his own pain . . . .\u201d Gallagher\u2019s attorney further reported that there had been no physical contact between the parties for two and one-half years, that they no longer worked together, and that they did not live anywhere near each other. These representations were not contradicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-5\">The judge appears then to have examined the original file; however, the record does not disclose exactly what he reviewed. He subsequently explained his understanding of the law \u201cin case there is an appellate issue,\u201d noting that \u201cif there is a hearing and the Judge makes a finding that [the plaintiff] was in need of protection and there was a sufficient basis for issuing that order, at the end of the year, [the plaintiff] has a right to request that the order be made permanent and... the fact that no abuse occurred during that period of time is not enough to dismiss or vacate the order.\u201d The judge made no comment as to the order of proof or burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-6\">The judge initiated a theoretical discussion with Gallagher\u2019s attorney concerning the notions of reconsideration, reopening the order, and vacating the expiring order, which counsel' indicated were not appropriate to the circumstances. The judge then stated, \u201cI\u2019m suggesting absent extraordinary conditions, the statute says [the plaintiff] is entitled to have [the order] made permanent or continued.\u201d The judge then asked Jones, \u201cDo you feel you are in need of protection, and if so, why?\u201d To this she replied,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b913-7\">\u201cAbsolutely ... I feel that I am in imminent fear. I am in fear of imminent physical and psychological harm. . . . First of all, the decision that was made last year was made . . . [and] it was the law that came in and protected me for the last year in which time I haven\u2019t heard from him. I now face renewal where it\u2019s going to end and I won\u2019t have that protection there. I\u2019ve been in fear of this day coming when I don\u2019t have the law there to protect me. I also have a case at the Mass[achusetts] Commission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>Against Discrimination [MCAD] pending, and we will have contact again in the future and I need that protection there for me.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b914-5\">After a brief comment by Gallagher\u2019s attorney concerning Jones\u2019s pending case (apparently to be litigated in the Superior Court), he asked the judge, \u201cwhat is the reasonableness of her current statement that she is in fear. Why is she in fear of imminent bodily harm?\u201d Gallagher\u2019s attorney also suggested that the order be extended until the end of the MCAD litigation. The judge, nevertheless, entered a permanent order and stated the following, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b914-6\">\u201cThe basis for that in case you want to have something on record to appeal is that I find that there is ongoing litigation matters between the two of them that stem from the original time, apparently when they were both working at the same location. That they have now separated that litigation apparently it is going into the Superior Court and she is in reasonable fear based on what [the issuing judge] apparently found in the past.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b914-7\">2. <em>Statutory background. </em>Chapter 209A was inserted in the General Laws in 1978. St. 1978, c. 447, \u00a7 2. \u201cThat statute, entitled \u2018Abuse Prevention,\u2019 has been described as a \u2018statutory mechanism by which victims of family or household abuse can enlist the aid of the State to prevent further abuse.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Contach, </em>47 Mass. App. Ct. 247, 253 (1999), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>407 Mass. 340, 344 (1990). The statute was enacted \u201cto address the problem of domestic violence through the provision of judicial remedies,\u201d <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>434 Mass. 331, 332 (2001), and the \u201cc. 209A proceeding is a civil, and not a criminal, proceeding.\u201d <em>Frizado </em>v. <em>Frizado, </em>420 Mass. 592, 596 n.3 (1995). Some orders, however, issued pursuant to the statute contain criminal penalties. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Finase, </em>435 Mass. 310, 312-314 (2001). The \u201c[violence brought on by, or exacerbated by, familial relationships was the \u2018mischief or imperfection to be remedied\u2019 by c. 209A.\u201d <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Lewis, supra </em>at 334, quoting from <em>Adoption of Derrick, </em>415 Mass. 439, 444 (1993). The statute attempts to balance sensitive issues, and often brutal aspects, of fundamental human relationships.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>The person suffering from abuse may commence a proceeding by filing a complaint, G. L. c. 209A, \u00a7 3, and those \u201cproceedings often take place in times of great turmoil in the parties\u2019 lives.\u201d Commentary to \u00a7 1:01 of the Guidelines for Judicial Practice: Abuse Prevention Proceedings (2000). \u201cThey are under considerable stress because by the very nature of the process they are required to reveal to strangers details of intimate relationships that have disintegrated into violence and, indeed, even hatred.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Contach, supra. </em>Consequences of the underlying situation, notwithstanding any order, tragically and too frequently include the most serious violence and sometimes death of the complainant. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>429 Mass. 745, 746 (1999) (defendant convicted of first degree murder and violating abuse prevention order under G. L. c. 209A, \u00a7 7); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bianchi, </em>435 Mass. 316, 317 (2001) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">In comparison, consequences to the defendant may appear to be much less severe, but they too are negative. Issuance of an order effects entry of that order in the Commonwealth\u2019s criminal records system, and the order can have an adverse effect upon the defendant in any future c. 209A proceeding and in certain future bail proceedings.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Wooldridge </em>v. <em>Hickey, </em>45 Mass. App. Ct. 637, 638 (1998). The order can also create criminal jeopardy specific to the defendant and subject him or her to arrest without a warrant. See <em>Richardson </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>53 Mass. App. Ct. 201, 203 (2001). \u201cThe judicial imprimatur on the 209A order lends it significant weight. This is not just a filing in court but a determination by the court.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Foreman, </em>52 Mass. App. Ct. 510, 515 (2001).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b915-6\">The Legislature intended the c. 209A judicial process to be as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>\u201cexpeditious and as comfortable as it reasonably can be for a lay person to pursue.\u201d <em>Frizado </em>v. <em>Frizado, </em>420 Mass. at 598.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> And, with great respect, we note that \u201c[j]udges often must deal with large numbers of these emotional matters in busy court sessions.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>\u201cA judge must consider carefully whether serious physical harm is imminent and should not issue a G. L. c. 209A order simply because it seems to be a good idea or because it will not cause the defendant any real inconvenience.\u201d <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Joyce, </em>421 Mass. 520, 523 n.1 (1995). Judges have been instructed to be especially sensitive, and to examine such cases with restraint and compassion, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Contach, </em>47 Mass. App. Ct. at 253, \u201cin the context of the entire history of the parties\u2019 hostile relationship.\u201d <em>Pike </em>v. <em>Maguire, </em>47 Mass. App. Ct. 929, 930 (1999). In the light of these ponderous, demanding, somewhat conflicting, and complicated circumstances, many of which are beneath the surface of complex lives, we state our understanding of the judicial inquiry and procedure upon a complainant\u2019s request that a c. 209A order be made permanent.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-5\">3. <em>Evidence of abuse. </em>For purposes of obtaining a protective order under G. L. c. 209A, abuse is defined as \u201c(a) attempting to cause or causing physical harm; (b) placing another in fear of imminent serious physical harm; (c) causing another to engage involuntarily in sexual relations by force, threat or duress.\u201d G. L. c. 209A, \u00a7 1. \u201cGeneralized apprehension, nervousness, feeling aggravated or hassled, i.e., psychological distress from vexing but nonphysical intercourse, when there is no threat of imminent serious physical harm, does not rise to the level of fear of imminent serious physical harm. . . . The judge must focus on whether serious physical harm is imminent and should not issue a c. 209A order on the theory that it will do no harm <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>. . . .\u201d <em>Wooldridge </em>v. <em>Hickey, </em>45 Mass. App. Ct. at 639. We have made no distinction in this regard between an initial (after-notice) order and a permanent order. \u201cAbuse\u201d has the same definition in either context. \u201cThe only criterion for extending the original order is a showing of continued need for the order.\u201d <em>Pike </em>v. <em>Maguire, supra </em>at 929.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">4. <em>Permanent order. </em>In 1990, the Legislature rewrote the statute, see St. 1990, c. 403, \u00a7 3, adding language that expressly grants the judge discretionary authority to \u201center a permanent order\u201d at the renewal hearing, generally, the date set in the original order when \u201cthe order is to expire\u201d and \u201cthe matter will again be heard.\u201d G. L. c. 209A, \u00a7 3.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> See <em>Crenshaw </em>v. <em>Macklin, </em>430 Mass. 633, 634-635 (2000). General Laws c. 209A, \u00a7 3, mandates that initial relief be granted for a fixed period of time, not to exceed a year, and that the order state on its face the date and time that the order is to \u201cexpire\u201d and the matter will again be \u201cheard.\u201d Upon that date, if the plaintiff appears, the court is directed to \u201cdetermine\u201d whether to extend or make permanent the order. Without further action by the court, the Legislature has directed that the order expire. There is no presumption that the order be continued. There is no entitlement that the order be made permanent. The order expires unless extended after a judicial determination, essentially, a new finding, that the plaintiff continues to require protection from \u201cabuse\u201d as explicitly defined in c. 209A, \u00a7 1 \u2014 in this case, requiring a finding that a permanent order is, in fact, what is reasonably necessary to protect Jones from being placed \u201cin fear of imminent serious physical harm\u201d by Gallagher. See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Molloy, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 306, 309 (1998) (\u201cextension of an annual order pursuant to \u00a7 3 ... is ... by no means automatic\u201d); <em>Pike </em>v. <em>Maguire, </em>47 Mass. App. Ct. at 929-930.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-5\">There is no burden on a defendant to testify or present evidence. \u201cThe burden is on the complainant to establish facts justifying the . . . continuance of an abuse prevention order. . . . The plaintiff must make the case for the awarding of relief.\u201d <em>Frizado </em>v. <em>Frizado, </em>420 Mass. at 596. \u201cAlthough it is not expressly stated in G. L. c. 209A, . . . [the] plaintiff must make a case for relief by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 597. See <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Joyce, </em>421 Mass. at 522.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-6\">5. <em>Evidentiary use of initial order and record. </em>The mere fact that a c. 209A order issued in the past, standing alone, is not enough for a judge to conclude, on a request for renewal, that \u201cadditional time [is] reasonably necessary to protect the plaintiff.\u201d G. L. c. 209A, \u00a7 3. From the record in this case, we are concerned that the judge may have acted upon a presumption that a complainant is entitled to have a one-year, after-notice order made permanent, absent the defendant being able to prove \u201cextraordinary conditions\u201d to persuade the court otherwise. It appears that in making the order permanent the judge inappropriately used the mere existence of the earlier order, issued by a different judge, at a different time, as the sole basis for making the order permanent.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-7\">The permanent abuse prevention order is therefore vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b918-9\">Appendix.</p>\n<p id=\"Ar7h\">\n<em>Sue Me</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b918-10\">To tear out your own heart with bloody</p>\n<p id=\"AMe\">jagged teeth, you must first bite through</p>\n<p id=\"b918-11\">the breast plate, then the breast bone, past</p>\n<p id=\"A-t\">several sore,-cracked and bmised ribs.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-12\">You seize it between upper and lower incisors</p>\n<p id=\"A8J9\">drag it, broken but still beating into</p>\n<p id=\"b918-13\">the fresh horrors of a new day.
