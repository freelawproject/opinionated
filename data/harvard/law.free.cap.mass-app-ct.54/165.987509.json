L. c. 123A, \u00a7 12(c), a Superior Court judge determined that the Commonwealth had not shown probable cause to believe that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>Robert Blanchette is a sexually dangerous person as defined in G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 1. The Commonwealth contends on appeal that the judge misapplied the pertinent standard for determining probable cause, erroneously rejecting in the process certain evidence presented by the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">The timing of the probable cause hearing in question compounds the difficulty of the issue presented. The hearing took place on May 2, 2000, after the effective date of St. 1999, c. 74, \u00a7\u00a7 3-8, which amended G. L. c. 123A, but before the decision in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bruno, </em>432 Mass. 489 (2000), which clarified many residual unsettled issues. Among those unsettled issues was the burden of proof that the Commonwealth must bear at a \u00a7 12(c) probable cause hearing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, at Blanchette\u2019s probable cause hearing, the Commonwealth expressly proceeded on a \u201cprobable cause to arrest\u201d standard, a less onerous burden of proof that <em>Bruno </em>later rejected in favor of a so-called \u201cdirected verdict\u201d standard. See <em>Bruno, supra </em>at 510. In reaching her decision, however, the judge indicated her reliance upon a standard of proof derived from the reasoning in a decision of another Superior Court judge, a standard which in large measure presaged the standard later articulated in <em>Bruno.</em></p>\n<p id=\"Aai\">Notwithstanding the position it took at the hearing,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the Commonwealth now contends that the judge in essence used the correct standard but misapplied it by evaluating and, in instances, rejecting the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence. We are called upon in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>this case to explore the meaning of the <em>Bruno </em>\u201cdirected verdict\u201d standard and to address the scope of the judge\u2019s role in making the requisite determination under \u00a7 12(c), \u201cwhether probable cause exists to believe that the person named in the petition is a sexually dangerous person.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 12(c).</p>\n<p id=\"AY_\"><em>Procedural background. </em>At the end of April, 2000, Blanchette had completed nearly sixteen years in prison for serious sexual offenses he had committed against four female children in 1979 and 1982. Days before his release, the Commonwealth filed a petition for temporary commitment under G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 12(6). After a hearing, Blanchette was ordered temporarily committed to the Treatment Center at Bridgewater pursuant to G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 12(e), pending a probable cause hearing. On May 2, 2000, the judge heard both Blanchette\u2019s motion to dismiss and the \u00a7 12(c) probable cause issue. On June 9, 2000, the judge concluded, as relevant here, that probable cause did not exist to believe that Blanchette is a sexually dangerous person. She then vacated her prior order holding him at the Treatment Center, and briefly stayed that order to permit an emergency appeal to a single justice of this court. The single justice then stayed Blanchette\u2019s release pending appeal, and he remains to date in the Treatment Center.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AKO\"><em>The probable cause hearing. </em>The only witness to testify was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>the Commonwealth\u2019s expert, Dr. NiHos Tomich, an experienced forensic psychologist who, as a \u201cqualified examiner,\u201d had previously performed a number of evaluations for sexual dangerousness. In addition, there were eight exhibits, not all of which are before us.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It is not clear from the hearing transcript precisely which of these documents the expert reviewed<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> in mating his evaluation of Blanchette, but it is clear that Tomich <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>based his opinion solely upon his six-hour long \u201ctotal review\u201d of that record since, prior to his testimony, he had not spoken with Blanchette.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">On direct examination, Tomich opined that Blanchette fit the definition of a sexually dangerous person under G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 1, in that he suffers from a mental abnormality or personality disorder that makes him likely to engage in future sexual offenses if not confined to a secure facility. He based this opinion upon his review of the records insofar as they addressed Blanchette\u2019s criminal offenses, personal history, and incarceration history.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">Blanchette\u2019s mental abnormality, the expert said, is pedophilia. His personality disorder is that of antisocial personality disorder. Tomich testified that, based on the nature of the 1979 and 1982 criminal sexual offenses, Blanchette exhibits symptoms of pedophilia,, as indicated by the number of Blanchette\u2019s victims (four), their ages (9-14 years old), that they were known to him, that two were of diminished capacity (both had cerebral palsy and one was blind), the number of sexual offenses (vaginal, digital and anal rapes) and their aggressive and sadistic nature (binding, threatening, using force on several victims, including a knife), and that he took pornographic pictures of at least one of the four girls. Blanchette\u2019s antisocial personality disorder is, in Tomich\u2019s view, evidenced by the aforesaid repetitive sexual offenses and by Blanchette\u2019s aggressive behavior while in prison as set forth in the Department of Correction disciplinary reports.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">The expert also based his opinion of \u201csexual dangerousness\u201d upon Blanchette\u2019s personal history (which indicated that he was raised in orphanages until age ten or eleven, was physically abused by his stepmother, and was beaten and threatened with knives \u2014 the latter behavior being replicated in some of Blanchette\u2019s later sexual offenses), that Blanchette had attempted suicide on several occasions, that he had a record of disciplinary problems while in prison, some for aggressive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>behavior, and that, while incarcerated, Blanchette had refused to undergo sex offender treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">On cross-examination, the expert was examined closely on the meaning of the term \u201cantisocial personality disorder.\u201d He indicated that it is a lack of regard for social norms evidenced since adolescence, a disregard for the safety of himself and others, aggressiveness, impulsivity, and a pattern of criminal behavior. When queried as to whether the disorder had evidenced itself in Blanchette since adolescence, Tomich acknowledged that no reference to such a disorder appeared in the report of the two examinations done of Blanchette in 1987 by a qualified examiner. As to impulsivity, Tomich saw it evidenced in several suicide attempts during the 1980\u2019s as well as in two instances of misconduct for which he received disciplinary reports, namely (a) a 1986 incident in which Blanchette got into a verbal altercation with a correction officer, after which he made a disrespectful gesture and remark to the officer; and (b) a 1995 incident where Blanchette used a pool cue to break some screens, for which he was fined fifty dollars. With regard to the asserted pattern of criminal conduct, Tomich acknowledged that Blanchette\u2019s criminal record consisted only of the four sex crimes for which he had been incarcerated \u2014 his sentence having begun when he was about forty years old \u2014 and a motor vehicle offense for which he had served three months in prison. The expert noted that Blanchette sought individual therapy between 1982 and 1984 for possible sexually abusive behavior but declined to undergo sex offender treatment while incarcerated.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\"><em>The judge\u2019s findings and rulings. </em>The judge recited facts underlying the 1984 indictments for which Blanchette was incarcerated that she took from her independent review of the police reports in evidence. She also summarized the expert\u2019s testimony, and, after herself reviewing the records in evidence that the expert had relied upon, noted that certain records did not bear out aspects of the expert\u2019s testimony. In that regard, the judge found that the Department of Correction records did not reflect a significant disciplinary record and that there was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>only one documented suicide attempt by Blanchette at the beginning of his incarceration, not four such attempts.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Akd\">The judge ruled that the Commonwealth had not satisfied its burden of presenting enough evidence to establish probable cause to believe that Blanchette remains sexually dangerous, i.e., it had not presented \u201csufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find, beyond a reasonable doubt, the predicate facts to establish sexual dangerousness: specifically, that Blanchette has a \u2018mental abnormality\u2019 or a \u2018personality disorder,\u2019 as those terms are defined in the statute, mating him \u2018likely\u2019 to engage in sexual offenses if not confined.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A2O\">The judge noted that the Commonwealth\u2019s expert had testifled \u201csummarily\u201d as to Blanchette\u2019s mental abnormality and personality disorder, observing that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"APp\">\u201c[tjhere is scant evidence to support this opinion, other than the fact of the convictions themselves .... [T]he Commonwealth provides insufficient evidence of the alleged acts which form the crucial support for their conclusion that Blanchette qualifies as an SDP. They conflate the statutory standard of probable cause by merely stating that because Blanchette committed sexually aggressive crimes, he should qualify as an SDP. . . . Acknowledging that \u2018pedophilia symptoms\u2019 can be unassessable while in prison, the Court . . . can find no evidence of severe assaultive behavior, outward sexual misbehavior, or obsessive or compulsive behavior by Blanchette while imprisoned. Five disciplinary reports over 15 years is an exemplary behavior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>record in prison. Blanchette\u2019s records indicate no mental health problems.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b200-5\"><em>The Commonwealth\u2019s position. </em>On appeal the Commonwealth urges the view that the judge misunderstood and misapplied the <em>Bruno </em>\u201cdirected verdict\u201d standard for \u00a7 12(c) determinations of probable cause. It maintains that it presented ample evidence to support its expert\u2019s conclusion that Blanchette fit the statutory definition of a sexually dangerous person. It argues in this regard that the judge misapprehended the quantum of evidence necessary to satisfy the directed verdict standard and misapplied the standard (a) in failing to view the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, instead evaluating and disputing the expert\u2019s testimony and the grounds for it, and (b) in discrediting the expert\u2019s testimony such that the judge mistakenly concluded that Tomich\u2019s opinion was based exclusively on Blanchette\u2019s prior criminal acts of sexual misconduct when it was in fact based on other factors as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\"><em>The \u00a7 12(c) \u201cdirected verdict\u201d standard. </em>In <em>Bruno, </em>the Supreme Judicial Court provided an overview and clarification of the statute, as amended in 1999. It noted that the focus of the statutory definition of \u201csexually dangerous person\u201d and of the statute\u2019s various procedural sections governing commitment is a defendant\u2019s \u201ccurrent mental condition.\u201d <em>Bruno, supra </em>at 498. Because of the potential deprivation of liberty to those persons subjected to civil commitment proceedings finder the statute, due process protections must apply to such proceedings, notwithstanding the civil nature of G. L. c. 123A. See <em>id. </em>at 507-510.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">While the \u00a7 12(c) probable cause hearing is a preliminary hearing, due process considerations caused the court to reject the Commonwealth\u2019s contention that it need only be held to a \u201cprobable cause to arrest\u201d standard of proof, as in a preliminary parole revocation hearing or in a grand jury proceeding. See <em>Bruno, supra </em>at 509-510. Because \u00a7 12(c) calls for an \u201cadversary proceeding conducted in a formal manner before a judge in the Superior Court, not unlike a trial,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 509, involving the right to counsel, the right to confront and cross-examine witnesses, and the right to call witnesses, and because its goal is to determine whether to hold a defendant for further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>proceedings, the court viewed the \u00a7 12(c) hearing as being more analogous to a District Court bind-over hearing held pursuant to G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 38. See <em>id. </em>at 510. In such a bind-over hearing, the Commonwealth\u2019s burden of proof is the \u201cdirected verdict\u201d standard referred to and explained in <em>Myers </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>363 Mass. 843, 850 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"ArH\">The primary function of the District Court bind-over hearing is to screen out at an early but critical stage those cases that should not go to trial, thereby sparing individuals from being held and unjustifiably prosecuted. See <em>Myers, </em>363 Mass. at 847. The judge\u2019s chief task is to \u201cdetermine whether there is sufficient credible evidence which justifies binding the defendant over,\u201d <em>Myers, supra, </em>and this determination \u201cis somewhat analogous in function to the trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion for a directed verdict as to whether there is sufficient evidence to send the case to the jury.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The judge should \u201cview the case as if it were a trial and he were required to rule on whether there is enough credible evidence to send the case to the jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 850. \u201cThe minimum quantum of evidence ... is more than that for probable cause to arrest but less than would \u2018prove . . . guilt beyond a reasonable doubt\u2019 \u201d (citations omitted). <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AYB\">The centrality of the screening function, moreover, \u201ccan only be effectuated by an adversary hearing where the defendant is given a meaningful opportunity to challenge the credibility of the prosecution\u2019s witnesses and to raise any affirmative defenses he may have.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 852. What this unavoidably entails for the hearing judge is that she make some assessment of the credibility of the evidence that is presented when making the determination as to whether sufficient evidence has been presented to warrant further proceedings.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This is an exercise requiring a very deft touch and considerable restraint on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>part of the judge. The proceeding is a preliminary one, and the evidence, of necessity, is often quite hastily cobbled together; to expect a trial-quality presentation would be unrealistic and contrary to the role which the hearing plays in the over-all scheme. The preliminary nature of the hearing \u2014 to be followed in many instances by trial, in the case of a bind-over hearing, and by a sixty-day commitment for evaluation and then possible trial, in the case of a c. 123A, \u00a7 12(c), probable cause hearing \u2014 dictates that ultimate credibility determinations are ordinarily to be reserved for a subsequent trier of fact.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-13\">\u201c[T]he judicial role in pretrial screening involves weighing and judgment rather than a wooden comparison of the testimony with the elements of the crime. Although credibility ordinarily is a matter for the jury, and it is not expected that judges will normally resolve testimonial conflicts at the preliminary hearing, cases do occasionally arise in which a witness\u2019s testimony is so weak or contradicted by sufficiently clear facts that the judge should have the power to dismiss the case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-22\"><em>Myers </em>v. Commonwealth, 363 Mass. at 853 n.12, quoting from A Model Code of Pre-Arraignment Procedure (T.D. No. 5) at 91 (Model Code). At the same time, the judge\u2019s role remains considerably greater at such a hearing than that of the proverbial potted plant: to make the requisite determination, the judge must be permitted to consider \u201cthe credibility of the witnesses and the quality of the evidence introduced.\u201d <em>Myers, supra </em>at 853, quoting Model Code, \u00a7 330.5(3).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b202-30\">Taking into account the preliminary nature of the \u00a7 12(c) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>probable cause hearing, the screening function that the hearing performs, the substantial public safety and liberty interests that are at stake, and the need to consider not only the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence but also the cross-examination of witnesses by the defendant and any evidence he may introduce, we are of the opinion that implementation of the \u201cdirected verdict\u201d decision-making process requires a two-part inquiry, one part of which is quantitative and the other qualitative. The judge must be satisfied, first, that the Commonwealth\u2019s admissible evidence,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> if believed, satisfied all of the elements of proof necessary to prove the Commonwealth\u2019s case. Second, she must be satisfied that the evidence on each of the elements is not so incredible, insubstantial, or otherwise of such a quality that no reasonable person could rely on it to conclude that the Commonwealth had met its burden of proof. The second part of the inquiry, of necessity, involves, inter alla, an assessment of credibility. In conducting this credibility assessment, the judge is not to look to whether she is herself persuaded by the evidence. Instead, the judge is to determine whether the evidence before her is of suitable quality to allow the action to proceed further along a course that was legislatively designed ultimately to place the matter before a trier of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"ARdq\"><em>Analysis. </em>Given the statutory scheme, the \u00a7 12(c) probable cause hearing, much like the District Court bind-over hearing \u2014 its functional and procedural analogue, but not its twin \u2014 has as its central function the screening out of meritless petitians brought by district attorneys under \u00a7 12(6). The district attorneys make their determinations of what petitions to bring \u2014 of selecting which persons convicted of statutorily enumerated sexual crimes are sexually dangerous and thus likely recidivists \u2014 without the benefit of explicit statutory guidelines. Given available statistics about the relationship between pedo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>philia and recidivism, persons who have committed sexual crimes against youngsters and who are regarded as potential pedophiles are doubtless often likely candidates for such petitions.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The challenge presented to judges is to screen out those petitions that, while meeting some eligibility criteria such as conviction of certain prior sex crimes, do not meet other statutory criteria. Section 1 of the statute identifies those elusive criteria.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">As relevant here, a \u201csexually dangerous person\u201d includes one who has been \u201cconvicted of . . . a sexual offense and who suffers from a mental abnormality or personality disorder which makes the person likely to engage in sexual offenses if not confined to a secure facility.\u201d G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 1. A \u201cmental abnormality\u201d in turn is defined as \u201ca congenital or acquired condition of a person that affects the emotional or volitional capacity of the person in a manner that predisposes that person to the commission of criminal sexual acts to a degree that makes the person a menace to the health and safety of other persons.\u201d <em>Ibid. A </em>\u201cpersonality disorder\u201d is defined as \u201ca congenital or acquired physical or mental condition that results in a general lack of power to control sexual impulses.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>See <em>Kansas </em>v. <em>Crane, </em>534 U.S. 407 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">In the hearing at issue, the judge was required to determine if probable cause existed to believe that Blanchette is a sexually dangerous person. The two-part inquiry, discussed above, required that she determine whether (a) the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence, if believed, satisfied all the elements it was required to prove in order to demonstrate that Blanchette was then sexu- ' ally dangerous; and (b) the evidence satisfying those elements was not so incredible, insubstantial, or otherwise of such a quality that no reasonable person could rely on it to conclude that the Commonwealth had proven Blanchette then sexually dangerous.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>The Commonwealth provided the judge with evidence that it thought at the time sufficient to meet a lower burden of proof than <em>Bruno </em>later decreed necessary for \u00a7 12(c) probable cause hearings. The judge was not unwarranted in thinking the evidence before her scant. It was for the Commonwealth to prove affirmatively that Blanchette had the requisite current mental condition(s) which, as a \u201cpredictive behavioral question,\u201d make it likely that Blanchette will reoffend. <em>Bruno, supra </em>at 510-511. The expert stated, to be sure, that Blanchette suffers from a mental abnormality (pedophilia) and from a personality disorder (antisocial personality disorder) and was likely to reoffend if not in a secure facility. The Commonwealth\u2019s expert touched the formulaic statutory bases in his testimony and alluded to the data upon which he relied in forming his opinions, but the judge was not, as the Commonwealth would have it, limited to a \u201cwooden comparison\u201d of his testimony with the statutory elements. Her role included the \u201cweighing and judgment\u201d that <em>Myers </em>alluded to, and that we have described as a qualitative assessment of the evidence. She received precious little assistance in this task.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">On direct examination, for example, the expert was neither asked to nor did he articulate the accepted diagnostic criteria for pedophilia and antisocial personality disorder, explain how the data upon which he relied satisfied some or all of the diagnostic criteria, discuss in what respect Blanchette\u2019s pedophilia was a condition meeting the statutory criteria for \u201cmental abnormality\u201d (including how it would create a predisposition to the commission of criminal acts), or in what way Blanchette\u2019s antisocial personality disorder was a \u201cpersonality disorder\u201d as defined in the statute (including how it might result in a general lack of power to control sexual impulses). The expert made no attempt to explain the clinical basis for linking Blanchette\u2019s past history and conduct, sexual and otherwise, with present or future behavior so as to produce the diagnosis of a currently sexually dangerous person. Otherwise put, the expert did not do much to explain his opinion on a reasoned basis that would allow evaluation of that opinion on its merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">The expert was, moreover, subjected to cross-examination which arguably revealed certain vulnerabilities in the personal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>ity disorder prong of his opinion. There is also the matter of the expert\u2019s reliance upon certain records, notably prison disciplinary reports, for aspects of his opinion, the reasonableness of which the judge questioned given her own evaluation of those records. Although the Commonwealth suggests that the judge improperly \u201csubstituted\u201d her own opinion for the expert\u2019s as to what the records signify, we think it entirely appropriate for the judge to have assessed the weight and over-all reliability and credibility of the expert\u2019s opinion by measuring it against matters already known to her. A Superior Court judge sees prison disciplinary reports as a matter of course in her job, and this experienced judge was surely in a position to make an informed assessment of the reports as to Blanchette. That her assessment differed from that of the Commonwealth\u2019s expert could properly factor into her determination of how credible that expert\u2019s testimony was and how much qualitative heft it could be accorded, just as the fact that the expert had never examined Blanchette could properly be part of such a calculus.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">Nonetheless, the judge never expressly indicated that she did not credit the expert\u2019s conclusion. The Commonwealth\u2019s point is also well taken that the judge appears to have reduced the grounds for the expert\u2019s opinion only to Blanchette\u2019s prior sex crimes, ignoring in the process other factors which he considered when forming his opinion, such as Blanchette\u2019s personal history and Blanchette\u2019s decision, while incarcerated, to decline sexual offender treatment. As to the latter, the Supreme Judicial Court cogently observed in <em>In re Hill, </em>422 Mass. 147, 157 (1996), that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-6\">\u201c[ejxamples of recent conduct showing sexual dangerousness may often be lacking where the individual\u2019s dangerous disposition is of a sort that there will be no occasion for that disposition to manifest itself in a secure environment. And it cannot be the case that an individual\u2019s refusal to submit to examination or to participate in treatment, in which his current dispositions might manifest themselves, will more or less automatically guarantee himself a favorable determination.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">The Commonwealth is also correct in observing that the judge\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>findings do not take into account the remaining exhibits in evidence. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, it appears from the judge\u2019s findings that she proceeded on the premise that she was required to determine whether she herself was persuaded by the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence, rather than, as we have discussed, whether that evidence was qualitatively of such a character that no reasonable person could rely on it to conclude that the Commonwealth had demonstrated probable cause that Blanchette was then sexually dangerous. In so doing, she may well have applied to the evidence a more rigorous qualitative standard than is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">In view of these deficiencies and given the <em>pre-Bruno </em>timing of the \u00a7 12(c) hearing at issue, with its concomitant uncertainty as to the applicable burden of proof, we think the interests of justice will best be served by vacating the judgment of dismissal and remanding the case to the judge for an expeditious reevaluation of the evidence and such further proceedings consistent with this opinion as she may deem appropriate. The stay of Blanchette\u2019s release is continued pending the judge\u2019s further consideration of the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b194-28\">Another unsettled issue, one to which the judge devoted a substantial part of her written rulings of law, was whether the statute was retroactively applicable to those, like Blanchette, whose convictions predated its enactment. The judge decided that the statute had no application to Blanchette, a ruling which proved to be at odds with the later holding in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bruno, </em>432 Mass. 489, 497-499 (2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b194-34\">At the hearing, the Commonwealth argued that \u201cthe probable cause hearing is not to determine whether this person has a mental abnormality or personality disorder. We are here to determine whether he should be committed to the Massachusetts Treatment Center for sixty days to have two qualified examiners examine him and evaluate him and provide the court with that information. The standard of probable cause to arrest here, not a required finding standard, fits this purpose. And with the testimony that you\u2019ve heard today from Dr. Tomich, who has just reviewed the records and not had an opportunity to speak with the defendant, I would suggest it would be illogical to come to the determination that this person has a mental abnormality or personality disorder.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"AZ3\">Blanchette maintains that the Commonwealth may not appeal from the judge\u2019s determination that no probable cause exists to believe he is a sexually dangerous person, basing this contention on the absence of any statutory provision expressly conferring such a right of appeal. Because we think that <em>Wyatt, petitioner, </em>428 Mass. 347, 351 (1998), and <em>Hill, petitioner, </em>422 Mass. 147, 151, 155, cert. denied, 519 U.S. 867 (1996), foreclose any serious contentian that the Commonwealth cannot appeal, we do not further address the point other than to observe that the current incarnation of G. L. c. 123A was enacted after <em>Wyatt </em>and <em>Hill </em>and did not revoke or limit <em>Wyatt's </em>broad holding that \u201c[t]he Commonwealth may appeal any ruling or judgment adverse to it in a c. 123A proceeding.\u201d See <em>Wyatt, supra </em>at 351.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"ARY\">Blanchette understandably protests his prolonged detention in the Treatment Center following the wrap-up of his prison sentence, given the judge\u2019s determination that no probable cause exists to believe him a sexually danger-pus person. That it has taken so long to address and resolve the legitimate questions raised on appeal concerning a matter of such gravity is without question lamentable. The unique circumstances provide some explanation: Blanchette was an early candidate for inclusion under a recently enacted statutory scheme attempting to deal with a seemingly intractable problem of immense social importance that left many difficult issues unsettled. He stood <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>convicted of heinous crimes against children and was not subject to supervised probation upon his release from incarceration. The Superior Court judge thought a sufficient showing had been made to warrant his temporary commitment under \u00a7 12(e) pending disposition of the probable cause determination. A single justice of this court thought a stay pending appeal was warranted given Blanchette\u2019s risk of flight and the substantiality of the Commonwealth\u2019s appellate issues. Blanchette sought further review pursuant to G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, which was denied without a hearing. The period of time on appeal preceding oral argument is attributable chiefly to the many months it took for the transcript to be prepared and to the concommitant delay in the preparation of the Commonwealth\u2019s brief. That the foregoing may explain the defendant\u2019s prolonged detention does not justify its occurrence and only underscores the need to prevent its recurrence. See generally <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kennedy, </em>435 Mass. 527, 531 (2001) (\u201cWhere, as here, the G. L. c. 123A proceedings are still ongoing and the defendant is detained beyond his discharge date, the liberty interests at stake compel strict adherence to the time frames set forth in the statute\u201d). While the Commonwealth has the right to appeal from adverse rulings in c. 123A proceedings, see note 3, <em>supra, </em>in instances involving detention beyond the discharge date, we think that, in view of <em>Kennedy, </em>it must henceforth obtain necessary transcripts and in all other respects prosecute the appeal in an expeditious fashion or risk dismissal of the appeal. Additionally, pending such appeals (and, in this case, during the pendency of the proceedings on remand), consideration should be given by the trial court judge in appropriate cases to devising and imposing conditions of supervised probation in lieu of detention in the Treatment Center.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b196-6\">The exhibits are described in the transcript as follows: Exhibit 1 \u2014 six-part Department of Correction folder for Blanchette; Exhibit 2 \u2014 Boston police reports; Exhibit 3 \u2014 Department of Social Services report; Exhibit 4 \u2014 Motion for commitment; Exhibit 5 \u2014 Institutional adjustment and case summary; Exhibit 6 \u2014 Report of qualified examiner to the court for examinations of Blanchette done on March 22 and April 2, 1987; Exhibit 7 \u2014 Certified copies of Blanchette\u2019s convictions; Exhibit 8 \u2014 Department of Correction disciplinary reports. The materials in the Commonwealth\u2019s record appendix are not compiled in a manner permitting us easily to ascertain which document(s) correspond to which exhibit number. Further, Exhibit 6 seems to be missing entirely.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b196-7\">Tomich testified that he \u201creviewed the entire record that I think you entered into evidence as DOC\u2019s six-part folder. Contained within that are pretrial probation reports, police reports, grand jury minutes, and Mr. Blanchette\u2019s institutional adjustment throughout the years he\u2019s been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>incarcerated.\u201d He later testified that he had not reviewed the Department of Social Services record, presumably Exhibit 3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"AqL\">The record reflects six disciplinary reports in Blanchette\u2019s fifteen years of incarceration, one of which was later dismissed. In 1986, Blanchette received a disciplinary report for insolent remarks and gestures he made toward a correctional officer; in 1989, the report \u2014 later dismissed \u2014 concerned use of a bent toothbrush to interfere with a locking device; in 1990, the report was for possession of unauthorized items, viz., a container of paint, two large plastic buckets, a television antenna, an extension cord, an electric Christmas candle, a pillow, and two extra blankets; in 1995, the report described Blanchette as having damaged with a pool cue five window screens that were stacked against a wall; in early 2000, the report was for Blanchette\u2019s being in possession of an unauthorized cane. As to the suicide attempt, it appears that the records reflect four suicide attempts, all in the early to mid-1980\u2019s; their significance in assessing Blanchette\u2019s current mental condition was not explained other than as indicative of impulsivity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"A-q\">The \u201cdirected verdict\u201d standard of <em>Myers </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>363 Mass. 843, 850 (1973), requires some assessment of credibility, while credibility generally plays no role in the analogous, but not identical, directed verdict decision at trial, where evidence is to be viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Baron, </em>356 Mass. 362, 365-366 (1969), cited in <em>Myers, supra </em>at 850.

The court\u2019s use of the \u201cdirected verdict\u201d label in <em>Bruno </em>and <em>Myers </em>to identify the decision-making process it envisions in each instance holds some potential for confusion in this regard. The label does no more than describe an analogue; it does not fully articulate the process.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b202-37\">It is to be noted in this regard that expert witnesses are not immune from such judicial scrutiny. It is telling that the court in <em>Bruno </em>observed that the c. 123A, \u00a7 12(c), probable cause hearing judge had heard testimony from two experts and that \u201c[t]he judge credited their testimony.\u201d <em>Bruno, supra </em>at 513. The necessary corollary is that the judge was equally free not to have credited their testimony in whole or in part. This is entirely in keeping with well established precedent holding that the law does not give the opinions of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>experts, even if uncontradicted, the benefit of conclusiveness.
