L. c. 119, \u00a7 51 A, and the substantiation of the report pursuant to G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 51B, the Department of Social Services (department) placed the plaintiff\u2019s name in its registry of alleged perpetrators (registry) maintained under G. L. c. 18B, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>\u00a7 <em>7(b), </em>and G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 5 IF. The plaintiff sought review of the decision in accordance with the department\u2019s \u201cfair hearing\u201d procedures set forth at 110 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 10.00 et seq. (1993). A department hearing officer upheld the determination, and the plaintiff sought judicial review under G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7). The department\u2019s decision was affirmed by a judge of the Superior Court and the plaintiff appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">The events that brought about the listing of the plaintiff in the registry were reported to the district attorney. This resulted in the bringing of charges against the plaintiff of indecent assault and battery on a child under fourteen, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13B. The plaintiff was acquitted by a jury of those charges, an outcome which took place while his appeal from the Superior Court judgment in the administrative case was pending in this court. Accordingly, we remanded the matter to the department so that the agency could consider the effect of the criminal proceedings. See <em>Covell </em>v. <em>Department of Social Servs., </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 427, 433 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">The case was heard again before a different department hearing officer, but with the same result. The administrative determination was again affirmed by the Superior Court. The plaintiff again appeals, asserting in essence that (1) the department\u2019s decision is not supported by substantial evidence, and (2) his constitutional right to procedural due process has been violated. We hold that, in a proceeding which could, and did, culminate in the labeling by the government of an individual as a possible (or even likely) perpetrator of abuse or neglect of a child entrusted to his care, the concept of substantial evidence requires a level of evidence that was not present in these proceedings. Therefore, we reverse. Our disposition makes it unnecessary to reach the constitutional questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-7\">1. <em>The legal framework. </em>The department\u2019s decision that the plaintiff\u2019s name should be placed in the registry, and the sufficiency of the evidence on which such determination was based, can be evaluated only with an understanding of the legal context in which the administrative process takes place. The registry is maintained by the department as a part of the \u201ccentral registry\u201d authorized by G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 5IF. See G. L. c. 18B, \u00a7 <em>7(b). </em>The central registry is a compilation of data regarding clients, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>providers and others, as well as fiscal and administrative information, used by the department in carrying out its responsibilities. The registry of alleged perpetrators (registry) is a section of the central registry that identifies certain individuals believed to have been responsible for the abuse<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> or neglect of one or more children. See 110 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 4.36 (1996). Information from it may be disseminated for the purpose of screening applicants for employment with the department involving interaction with children or clients, including volunteers and student interns; applicants to become foster parents; and applicants to become adoptive parents. There may be access to the registry for the purpose of providing appropriate services to any child in the custody of the department or in connection with investigations of allegations of abuse and neglect. In addition, the commissioner of the department may, as a matter of discretion, authorize any other person to have access to the registry. See 110 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 4.38 (1996). The alleged perpetrator\u2019s listing in the registry is maintained for a period of seventy-five years unless ordered removed by an administrative or judicial determination. See 110 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 4.37 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b835-7\">There is a sequential process leading to placement of a name in the registry. It begins typically with the filing with the department of a report of abuse or neglect of a child. See G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 51A. The department, pursuant to G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 51B, investigates the allegations of the \u00a7 51A report. The department \u201csupports\u201d the report if it determines, based on its investigation, that there is \u201creasonable cause to believe\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that an incident of sexual abuse by a caretaker has taken place. 110 Code Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>Regs. \u00a7 4.32(2) (1996). A \u201csupported\u201d report does not lead automatically to the placement of a name in the registry; indeed, a \u201csupported\u201d report often will not identify the perpetrator. An alleged perpetrator is listed in the registry if three conditions are satisfied: (1) the allegations in the \u00a7 51A report are \u201csupported\u201d; (2) the allegations are referred to the district attorney, see G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 51B(4); and (3) there is \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d that the alleged perpetrator was responsible for the child\u2019s abuse or neglect. 110 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 4.37 (1996). The department\u2019s regulations incorporate the definition of \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d that appears in G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 1(6), specifically, \u201csuch evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">Once an individual has been listed in the registry, he may exercise his right to an administrative appeal. 110 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 10.06(8) (1994). This introduces a proceeding conducted before a department hearing officer, which the department\u2019s regulations entitle, perhaps immodestly, a \u201cFair Hearing.\u201d Pursuant to 110 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 10.23 (1993), the department allocates to the listed individual the burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence. In order to obtain a reversal of the decision that he be listed in the registry, the individual must prove that the department\u2019s decision or procedures relating thereto were not in conformity with department policies or regulations, or that the department acted without a reasonable basis or in an unreasonable manner resulting in substantial prejudice to the listed party. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">We must assume that these generalized references to the department\u2019s policies and procedures, and to the reasonableness of its actions, include a recognition that the department may lawfully list an individual in the registry only when there is \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d as defined, that the individual was responsible for a child\u2019s abuse or neglect. See 110 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 4.37 (1996). Thus, it is at this point that some confusion creeps into the process. The department, pursuant to its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>own regulations, may not list an individual in the registry unless there is substantial evidence that he was in fact responsible for the abuse or neglect of a child. That suggests that the department has initially allocated the burden of proving the underlying facts to itself, at least for its own internal purposes. However, when the listed individual seeks an administrative review of that internal determination, the department imposes the burden of proof on that individual. Thus, it is unclear who actually has the burden on the subject, and what that burden is.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Obviously, it is permissible for the department to assign to an appellant the task of demonstrating that the agency has committed an error of law, including that given findings are unwarranted because not supported by substantial evidence. It is something else entirely to thrust on the appellant under these circumstances the burden of proving the relevant facts, i.e., proving that he is not a perpetrator of abuse or neglect. The administrative hearing is an evidentiary hearing, suggesting that the burden placed on the appellant is not merely a burden to demonstrate error, but is a burden to produce evidence and to persuade the fact finder of his innocence. This has significant ramifications from the viewpoint of procedural due process, although, for reasons stated below, we do not decide this case on constitutional grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">Finally, should the listing of the individual in the registry be upheld by the department\u2019s hearing officer, the individual may seek judicial review in the Superior Court in accordance with the provisions of G. L. c. 30A. The standards of review are set forth in G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7). Review of department decisions upholding listings in the registry will generally implicate the standard contained in \u00a7 14(7)(e), i.e., that the substantial rights of a party may not be prejudiced by an agency decision that is unsupported by substantial evidence. In this regard, the weighing of evidence, including credibility determinations, is for the hearing officer. See <em>Guarino </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Security, </em>393 Mass. 89, 92 (1984). But the reviewing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>court\u2019s decision on the question whether substantial evidence to support a finding is present must be made on the entire record, taking into consideration both what supports the challenged finding and what detracts from that support. See <em>Edward E. </em>v. <em>Department of Social Servs., </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 478, 480-481 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">2. <em>The administrative proceeding. </em>After the matter was remanded by this court, a second administrative hearing was conducted. There were two witnesses: the department investigator, who prepared the \u00a7 5IB report \u201csupporting\u201d the allegations of abuse, and the plaintiff, who denied that any abuse had occurred. Neither the child nor the child\u2019s mother testified at the administrative hearing. Documentary evidence was also received, including, inter alla, the relevant \u00a7 51A and \u00a7 5IB reports and a partial transcript of the criminal trial in the Barn-stable District Court in which the plaintiff was acquitted of the charges (indecent assault and battery on a child under fourteen) arising out of the department\u2019s report to the district attorney.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">We summarize material findings of the hearing officer, which were either uncontested or warranted by the evidence, as well as certain additional testimony. When Linda<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> was three years of age, the plaintiff and Linda\u2019s mother were married. The plaintiff is not Linda\u2019s biological father. The mother bore four more children during her marriage to the plaintiff. The plaintiff purchased a store in June, 1991. He worked in the store, as did the mother, until the fall of 1992, when the mother stopped working prior to the birth of a child. Linda assisted the plaintiff on two or three occasions in June, 1992, at which times she operated the cash register and performed other odd jobs. In June, 1992, Linda was approximately twelve and one-half years of age. The relationship between Linda and her stepfather, which had previously been strained, became more positive while she worked at the store during that month.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-7\">The plaintiff purchased a new store in March, 1993. Linda worked there in April, 1993; visited her biological father during <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>that summer; and then worked in the new store twice per week until October, 1993. By the spring of 1993, the relationship between Linda and the plaintiff had again deteriorated, and, following Linda\u2019s visit with her father that summer, she and the plaintiff argued frequently. Both the plaintiff and the mother disciplined Linda. In September, 1993, she upset both the plaintiff and her mother by secretly attending a \u201cslam dance\u201d to which they had forbidden her to go.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">In October, 1993, Linda told a friend that she had been sexually abused by the plaintiff. She also informed her school guidance counselor that the abuse had occurred about a year and one-half earlier. At the guidance counselor\u2019s suggestion, Linda also told her mother. Prior to October, 1993, Linda had not spoken of the events in question. The guidance counselor, a mandated reporter under G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 51 A, filed a report of alleged abuse with the department. The case was assigned to a department investigator, see G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 5IB, who interviewed Linda, her mother, the guidance counselor and the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">Linda told the investigator that, on three Saturday evenings in 1992 when she was alone with the plaintiff at the store, the plaintiff placed his hand under her shirt, fondled her breasts, and placed his hand inside her underwear. Linda reported the same events to her mother and to the guidance counselor, and appears to have testified consistently at the criminal trial. The plaintiff denied that he had committed the acts in question. He stated that he did sit with Linda on the couch in the back room of the store; that they would sometimes give each other back rubs; and that he at times rubbed her neck on top of her clothing. He stated further that any incident that appeared inappropriate was only incidental contact.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-7\">The hearing officer upheld the \u201csupport\u201d by the department of the \u00a7 51A report. We agree with that determination because such support requires only that there be \u201creasonable cause\u201d to believe that an incident of abuse or neglect by a caretaker has occurred, see 110 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 4.32(2) (1996), an easily achieved determination which was permissible here. See <em>Care &amp; Protection of Robert, </em>408 Mass. 52, 63 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-8\">The hearing officer also upheld the department\u2019s listing of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>appellant in the registry. She found correctly that the first two conditions for such a listing, i.e., that the allegation of child abuse had been \u201csupported\u201d and that there had been a referral to the district attorney, 110 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 4.37 (1996), had been satisfied. She then turned to the third condition, specifically that there be substantial evidence that the plaintiff was responsible for the alleged abuse or neglect, <em>ibid., </em>and determined that that condition had been satisfied as well. In this regard, she found that Linda\u2019s \u201crecollection of the details [was] credible and reliable.\u201d Brushing aside the plaintiff\u2019s suggestion that Linda may have misrepresented the events a year and one-half later because she was angry at being disciplined, the hearing officer noted that the plaintiff \u201ccorroborated almost all of the details of [Linda\u2019s] story, excluding the actual touching and/or fondling which he continues to deny.\u201d On this basis, the hearing officer concluded that the record contained substantial evidence to support the conclusion that the plaintiff sexually abused Linda.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">3. <em>Adequacy of the appellate record. </em>The department makes a half-hearted effort to avoid the whole issue by contending that the plaintiff\u2019s failure to request a transcript of the agency hearing precludes him from contending that the evidence was not sufficient to support the hearing officer\u2019s findings. The department is technically correct. While it is the agency\u2019s obligation to file an official record with respect to a judicial review of its proceeding, see G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 11(6), under the version of Superior Court Standing Order 1-96 then applicable, the agency was not required to include a hearing transcript unless a party requested it and, ordinarily, paid for it.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In the present case, however, it is clear from the record what evidence was presented. Indeed, the parties do not disagree as to what the evidence was, only which version should be believed. The basis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>of the department\u2019s case is understood. The record contains the relevant documentary evidence, as well as much of the transcript of the criminal trial. The hearing officer's findings also relate significant portions of the evidence. We observe that a party who challenges administrative findings on the ground that they are not supported by substantial evidence assumes a considerable risk that his appeal will misfire if he fails to provide an adequate evidentiary record for review. Nevertheless, on the record which is before us in this case, we are able to judge whether the listing of the plaintiff as an alleged perpetrator has adequate evidentiary support.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-4\">4. <em>Discussion. </em>The department concedes, as it must, that its administrative proceeding held to determine whether the plaintiff has been properly listed in the registry implicates due process considerations. It then points out that \u201c[t]he fundamental requirement of due process is the opportunity to be heard \u2018at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mathews </em>v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 333 (1976), quoting from <em>Armstrong </em>v. <em>Manzo, </em>380 U.S. 545, 552 (1965). See <em>Matter of Kenney, </em>399 Mass. 431, 435 (1987). That formulation is correct as far as it goes; but here there must also be a relationship between the quality of the evidence presented to the tribunal and the kind of decision that the tribunal renders. What may be adequate to support findings on certain subjects will not of necessity be adequate to support findings on others.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">This concept is captured by the definition of \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d as \u201csuch evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 1(6). 110 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 4.37 (1996). The conclusion to be reached dictates the kind of evidence on which a reasonable person would rely. The \u201creasonable mind\u201d demands different levels of evidence depending on the significance of the finding to be made. Obviously, the amount and character of the evidence that we demand is not the same in deciding where to have dinner as it is in deciding whether to have life-threatening surgery. There is no abstract quantum of evidence that satisfies the \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d test in all circumstances. What constitutes \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d varies with the importance of the decision involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>Here, the decision reached by the department is one of considerable significance. The plaintiff has been branded a likely sex offender against a youthful, and thus particularly vulnerable, victim who had been entrusted to his care. While access to the registry is limited, it can have a major impact on the listed individual. As indicated above, it is used to screen applicants for employment with the department who would have direct contact with clients or children; applicants to become foster parents; and applicants to become adoptive parents. It is used in connection with the provision of services to children in the department\u2019s custody, as well as for investigations of allegations of child abuse or neglect. The commissioner of the department may, as a matter of discretion, permit access to any other individual or group.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> See 110 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 4.38 (1996). It follows that the decision to list an individual in the registry is hardly a trivial one, and the \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d necessary to support such a determination must be defined accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-4\">The evidence supporting the department\u2019s decision in this case was exclusively hearsay. That by itself does not render it not \u201csubstantial.\u201d The so-called \u201clegal residuum\u201d rule (i.e., that, even given the relaxed evidentiary rules applicable in administrative proceedings, an agency\u2019s decision could not be based entirely on evidence inadmissible in courts) apparently embodied in <em>Sinclair </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Security, </em>331 Mass. 101, 103 (1954), has effectively been rejected in Massachusetts by <em>Embers of Salisbury, Inc. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Bevs. Control Commn., </em>401 Mass. 526, 530 (1988). The latter case referred to the line drawn in <em>Sinclair </em>not as a line \u201cbetween evidence admissible in a court and evidence that is inadmissible because of the rules of evidence observed by courts,\u201d but as a line \u201cbetween evidence having indicia of reliability and probative value and that which does not.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>As we stated in <em>Edward E. </em>v. <em>Department of Social Servs., </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. at 480, \u201c[t]he question before us is not whether the administrative decision was based exclusively upon uncor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>roborated hearsay but whether the hearsay presented at the fair hearing was reliable.\u201d To that we add that reliability must be judged in relation to the significance of the decision being made.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">In the present case, the sole evidence of abuse was Linda\u2019s statements that the abuse had occurred. She made the statements within a few days of each other to a friend, a guidance counselor, her mother, and a department investigator. Subsequently, she testified consistently at the criminal trial. The decision thus turned on the hearing officer\u2019s belief that Linda\u2019s disclosures were credible. Determinations of credibility are normally for the fact finder, see <em>Hotchkiss </em>v. <em>State Racing Commn., </em>45 Mass. App. Ct. 684, 691 n.7 (1998), and a reviewing court does not ordinarily make alternative findings of fact. <em>Id. </em>at 698.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">Here, however, we do not see how the hearing officer could have judged Linda\u2019s credibility. Linda never testified before her. The child\u2019s only testimony was given at the criminal trial, after which the plaintiff was acquitted. It has been held in other contexts that an agency cannot evaluate the credibility of witnesses without observing their demeanor when testifying. See <em>Salem </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Commn. Against Discrimination, </em>404 Mass. 170, 175 (1989); <em>Fox </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Rev., </em>51 Mass. App. Ct. 336, 342-343 (2001). In this case, the hearing officer attempted to judge Linda\u2019s credibility through the prism of the testimony of the department investigator, buttressed by the fact that Linda had told the same story to different people. That the investigator may have been credible when reporting the hearsay does not mean ipso facto that the declarant was credible or that the hearsay was reliable. Furthermore, statements \u201cdo not attain trustworthiness through a process of repetition.\u201d <em>Edward E. </em>v. <em>Department of Social Servs., supra </em>at 486.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-7\">To the extent that there was corroboration of Linda\u2019s statements at all, that corroboration consisted of her other consistent statements and of the plaintiff\u2019s testimony about \u201cthe events leading up [to] the [alleged] abuse,\u201d to which the hearing officer gave considerable weight. That Linda told essentially the same story to different people may be, at least on this record, more testimony to intelligence than it is testimony to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>trustworthiness. With respect to the plaintiff\u2019s \u201ccorroboration,\u201d he admitted actions on his part that were not criminal, while steadfastly denying that he had engaged in any behavior which warranted censure. While the fact that the plaintiff agreed with Linda on certain activities may qualify as a theoretical form of \u201ccorroboration,\u201d it is not corroboration in the practical sense that it provides convincing support for Linda\u2019s accusations. Fairly examined, the record supporting the determination consists of the cold transcript of Linda\u2019s statements and little else.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\">It is not our intention to create a right of confrontation in these cases. See <em>White </em>v. <em>White, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 132, 141 (1996). There are reasons why it may be in a child\u2019s best interest that she not testify. But the legitimacy of such concerns does not excuse the absence of substantial evidence of facts on which serious decisions are predicated. Often there will be evidence that genuinely corroborates a child\u2019s hearsay statements; or, put differently, there will be other indicia that the hearsay is reliable. Where, as here, such other indicia are absent, the decision cannot stand. We have in this case the unsubstantiated hearsay statements of a child delivered a year and one-half after the alleged events (there being no allegation that the events were repeated in the interim), and under circumstances suggesting a possibility of fabrication or exaggeration. Reasonable minds do not accept such evidence as adequate to support a conclusion of this consequence. See <em>Arnone </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dept. of Social Servs., </em>43 Mass. App. Ct. 33, 37 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">5. <em>Disposition. </em>The judgment of the Superior Court is reversed. A judgment shall enter setting aside the department\u2019s decision and directing removal of the plaintiff\u2019s name from the registry.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b835-10\">\u201cAbuse\u201d for this purpose is \u201cthe non-accidental commission of any act <em>by a caretaker </em>upon a child under age 18 which causes, or creates a substantial risk of physical or emotional injury, or constitutes a sexual offense under the laws of the Commonwealth or any sexual contact between a caretaker and a child under the care of that individual.\u201d 110 Code Mass.

Standing Order 1-96 was again amended, effective April 8, 2002, to restore to the plaintiff the obligation to provide a transcript when there are allegations that the agency decision \u201cis not supported by substantial evidence or is arbitrary or capricious, or is an abuse of discretion.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b842-5\">Because any individual may obtain official confirmation or denial that he is listed in the registry, 110 Code Mass.
