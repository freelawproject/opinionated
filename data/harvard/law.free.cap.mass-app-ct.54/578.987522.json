(school), stepped out and fell on a step and landing. She sued the school,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> contending it negligently maintained the step and landing.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-17\">Fox\u2019s initial complaint contained only a single count alleging <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>common-law negligence. Subsequently, however, she moved to amend the complaint to assert a claim for damages arising under G. L. c. 143, \u00a7 51 (as amended through St. 1993, c. 495, \u00a7 35), a statute providing, in part, that \u201c[t]he . . . occupant ... in controlf] of a . . . building shall comply with the provisions of ... the state building code . . . and such person shall be liable to any person injured for all damages caused by a violation of any of said provisions.\u201d A judge of the Superior Court denied her motion, ruling that here, although violation of the building code would be evidence of negligence, a code violation would not, in and of itself, give rise to an action for damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-4\">When the case came to trial before a different judge, Fox sought an instruction to the effect that a violation of the building code causing damage to her would require a verdict in her favor. The trial judge declined to give that instruction, ruling, like the motion judge, that although violation of a code provision was evidence of negligence, it did not, by itself, provide a vehicle for recovery.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Consistent with that ruling, the trial judge told the jury that violation of the code was some evidence of the school\u2019s negligence. After deliberating, the jury returned a verdict in the school\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">On appeal, Fox seeks reversal of the motion judge\u2019s denial of her motion to amend the complaint and a new trial because the trial judge failed to instruct the jury in accordance with her requested instruction. Neither action was error and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">There is no doubt that violation of a regulation is some evidence of negligence. See <em>Perry </em>v. <em>Medeiros, </em>369 Mass. 836, 841 (1976); <em>Matteo </em>v. <em>Livingstone, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 658, 659 (1996). On its face, G. L. c. 143, \u00a7 51, travels beyond use of a regulatory violation as evidence of negligence by stating that, when the building code is involved, a violation that injures someone allows the injured person to recover damages. Arguing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>that \u00a7 51 means precisely what it says, Fox points to dictum in <em>St. Germaine </em>v. <em>Pendergast, </em>411 Mass. 615, 619 (1992), where the court, citing <em>Repucci </em>v. <em>Exchange Realty Co., </em>321 Mass. 571 (1947), stated that \u00a7 51 \u201ccan, in appropriate circumstances, provide a basis for civil liability in damages.\u201d Later, in <em>Glidden </em>v. <em>Maglio, </em>430 Mass. 694, 698 (2000), the court, citing <em>St. Germaine, </em>repeated the same statement, also in dictum.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">In order to understand the \u201cappropriate circumstances\u201d to which the court referred in <em>St. Germaine, </em>however, one has to look at several other cases. The first of those is <em>Repucci </em>itself. There, the plaintiffs had been injured by a defective fire escape when attempting to flee a fire in the defendant\u2019s building. At the time, G. L. c. 143, \u00a7 21, required building owners to keep fire escapes, and \u201cother means of escape from fire,\u201d \u201cin good repair and ready for use.\u201d <em>Repucci </em>v. <em>Exchange Realty Co., supra </em>at 572. Chapter 143, \u00a7 51, as it then existed, imposed on building owners, and certain others, liability for damages to those injured by a violation of \u00a7 21.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Repucci </em>v. <em>Exchange Realty Co., supra </em>at 574.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">The plaintiffs\u2019 cases in <em>Repucci </em>were submitted to the jury on a theory of common-law negligence and on the theory of statutory liability. The jury found for the plaintiffs on both theories and the defendant appealed. After analyzing only the statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>claim, the Supreme Judicial Court affirmed in an opinion concluding that \u201c[s]ince the plaintiffs were entitled to go to the jury on the statutory counts, we forbear discussion as to whether there was also a case for the jury on the counts based upon negligence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 579.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-4\"><em>Repucci </em>thus established the proposition that a statutory cause of action was available to those injured by a building owner\u2019s failure to keep \u201cmeans of escape from fire\u201d \u201cin good repair and ready for use.\u201d But in <em>Festa </em>v. <em>Piemonte, </em>349 Mass. 761, 761 (1965), the court made it clear that the cause of action was narrow, arising only when the injured person was actually fleeing a fire and providing no path to recovery to one injured while using a stairway or other means of egress for another purpose. In its brief opinion, the court said that \u201cnone of the benefits of G. L. c. 143, \u00a7\u00a7 21 and 51, is \u2018available to persons using stairways and egresses for purposes other than escape from danger from fire,\u2019 \u201d <em>ibid., </em>and affirmed denial of recovery to a person who was injured when he fell down a set of stairs after adjusting a rooftop television antenna.</p>\n<p id=\"AYW\">Chapter 143, \u00a7 21, was repealed by St. 1972, c. 802, \u00a7 28. That legislation for the first time created a comprehensive State building code.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As part of the legislation, the Legislature modified \u00a7 51 so that, in material part, it read as it reads today. See St. 1972, c. 802, \u00a7 35. In <em>McAllister </em>v. <em>Boston Housing Auth., </em>429 Mass. 300 (1999), however, the Supreme Judicial Court imported into the new \u00a7 51 the fire safety concerns the old statute embodied. <em>McAllister </em>involved a claim by a building tenant who was injured when she slipped on ice that had accumulated on the building\u2019s exterior stairs. She brought a claim for common-law negligence and, asserting that the icy stairs violated the State building code, also requested a jury instruction under c.143, \u00a7 51, as amended. The court disposed of the statutory issue in the following footnote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-7\">\u201cThe plaintiff also argues that the judge erred by not reading a proposed jury instruction stating that the defendant \u2018shall be liable . . . [for] a violation of the State Building <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>Code,\u2019 citing G. L. c. 143, \u00a7 51. There was no error. \u2018[N]one of the benefits of G. L. c. 143, [\u00a7 51] is \u201cavailable to persons using stairways and egresses for purposes other than escape from danger from fire.\u2019 \u201d <em>Festa </em>v. <em>Piemonte, </em>349 Mass. 761, 761 (1965)\u201d (alterations in original).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-5\"><em>McAllister </em>v. <em>Boston Housing Auth., supra </em>at 304 n.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">Notwithstanding any conclusion we might reach were we writing on a clean slate, controlling cases regard the pedigree of c. 143, \u00a7 51, as a limitation on its facially broad language. Accordingly, the \u201cappropriate circumstances\u201d for recovery under \u00a7 51 are those in which a violation of the State building code results in an injury to someone fleeing a fire. No fire motivated Fox\u2019s exit from the building when she was injured. Consequently, any school violations of the building code, although evidence of negligence, did not themselves permit recovery under c. 143, \u00a7 51.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b606-18\">She also sued the building\u2019s owner, the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Boston Corp. She voluntarily dismissed that part of the action before trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b607-7\">The complaint, of course, had not been amended to assert the claim for which Fox sought the instruction. The trial judge did not deny Fox\u2019s request for that reason. Had the trial judge elected to give such an instruction, she could have permitted an amendment to the complaint, see Mass.R.Civ.P. 15(b), 365 Mass. 761 (1974), for by then the school was fully aware of Fox\u2019s claim that violation of the code entitled her to recovery and the alleged code violations had been explored at trial on the theory that the violations were evidence of negligence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b608-7\">Insofar as \u00a7 51 is concerned, <em>St. Germaine </em>held that the section did not apply to single-family homes. <em>St. Germaine </em>v. <em>Pendergast, </em>411 Mass. at 619. See also <em>Santos </em>v. <em>Bettencourt, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 90 (1996), which reached the same conclusion in the wake of statutory changes provoked by the original <em>St. Germaine </em>opinion and its successor, <em>St. Germaine </em>v. <em>Pendergast, </em>416 Mass. 698 (1993). In <em>Glidden </em>v. <em>Maglio, </em>430 Mass. at 698-699, the trial judge ruled that the statute was inapplicable to a three-family dwelling. The Supreme Judicial Court, stating that it need not examine the correctness of that conclu- - sion, held that the record was devoid of any evidence that the alleged building code violation \u2014 failure to secure a building permit before beginning work \u2014 had caused the accident. None of these cases mentioned concerns regarding fire safety. See discussion, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b608-8\">Section 51 imposed similar liability for violation of \u00a7\u00a7 24-28, and 30. Sections 24-27 also dealt with fire safety issues. Section 28 dealt with building inspections and issuance of certificates of occupancy \u201cspecifying the number of persons for whom the egresses and means of escape from fire are sufficient.\u201d Section 30 required those who made changes to buildings that had been issued a certificate under \u00a7 28 to notify a building inspector so that a new inspection could be made. See G. L. c. 143, \u00a7\u00a7 24-28, 30, 51, as amended by St. 1943, c. 544, \u00a7 3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b609-8\">The same legislation also repealed G. L. c. 143, \u00a7\u00a7 24-28, 30. See note 4, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
