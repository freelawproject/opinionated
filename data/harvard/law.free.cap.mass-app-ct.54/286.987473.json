On cross motions for summary judgment, a judge of the Superior Court allowed the motion of the primary insurer, American Alliance Insurance Company (American), denied RLI Insurance Company\u2019s (RLI\u2019s) motion, and made a declaration that all claims arising from the shooting rampage arose out of a single occurrence; that American\u2019s policy with respect to the underlying claims would be exhausted upon payment of its $1 million per occurrence limit; and that RLI\u2019s obligation to pay would begin upon exhaustion of American\u2019s per occurrence limit. The effect of the judgment was to increase RLI\u2019s exposure under its excess policy of insurance. RLI appealed. The crux of this dispute is whether there were multiple \u201coccurrences\u201d under the American policy, requiring American to pay its aggregate policy limit of $3 million. We affirm the judgment, but because our analysis differs from that of the Superior Court judge, we set forth our reasoning following a summary of the undisputed facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\"><em>Facts. </em>On December 14, 1992, Wayne Lo, a student at the college, went on a shooting spree that lasted eighteen minutes, spanned approximately a quarter of a mile, and resulted in the killing of two and the injuring of four individuals.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">The events of the day began at approximately 10:00 a.m., when a receptionist at the college took delivery of a package addressed to Lo that bore the return address of an arms store. She advised certain of the college\u2019s residence directors of the package, and they brought it with them to a regularly scheduled meeting with Bernard Rodgers, a dean of the college. There was discussion of the package at the meeting, which lasted about an hour and included discussion of other business. Concern was expressed over the return address, \u201cClassic Arms\u201d in North Carolina, and that the package might contain a weapon in violation of the college policy prohibiting firearms, weapons, and explosives on college property. Dean Rodgers and the residence directors' decided to allow the package to be delivered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>to Lo, and that once received by him a prompt inquiry would be undertaken to determine the package contents. Following the meeting, the package was returned to the package room, where it was picked up by Lo a short time later.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">Katherine \u201cTrinka\u201d Robinson, one of the residence directors, learned that Lo had picked up the package and followed him back to his dormitory room, where he opened the door to her knock. She saw the unopened package and requested that Lo show her its contents. Lo refused, relying on college policy requiring that permission to search be obtained from the associate dean of students, and that the search be in the presence of at least one other college staff member. Robinson left and called Dean Rodgers from her apartment. He directed her to return to Lo\u2019s room to determine the package contents. Accompanied by her husband, Floyd Robinson, also a residence director, Katherine Robinson returned to Lo\u2019s room and, when he opened the door, observed three or four apparently empty black plastic magazines, a black plastic rifle stock, and an empty metallic army surplus cartridge box, but no ammunition or gun. Lo explained that the cartridge box was a gift for his father, and the other items were for his own use at home in Montana, where he had a semiautomatic rifle that he used for target practice. Lo gave this same explanation to Dean Rodgers who, after Katherine Robinson called to describe what she had observed in Lo\u2019s room, requested that Lo come immediately to the dean\u2019s office. When Lo arrived at the dean\u2019s office with the items, he appeared to be calm and was not defensive as he expressed to the dean his understanding of the college\u2019s policy that no firearms were permitted on campus.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">Later that day, Lo traveled by taxi to a Pittsfield sporting goods store where he purchased an assault rifle. That evening, sometime after 9:00 p.m., as Lo was attending a house council meeting with Floyd Robinson and other students, Katherine Robinson received a telephone call at her home. The caller, who refused at the time to identify himself, stated that Lo had a gun and live ammunition and was going to kill the members of the Robinson family and others the following night. The caller was another student with whom Lo had just had dinner, during which Lo performed a mock \u201cLast Supper\u201d and indicated he was go<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>ing to till. The Robinsons contacted the college provost, Ba Win, and at his urging went with their children to the Win home. There they called Dean Rodgers to convey a plan to locate Lo and search his room for weapons. As they spoke, they heard shots being fired nearby that turned out to be the opening salvo in the unfolding tragedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">Some of the individuals who were wounded, their families, and families of the deceased brought suit against the college, in essence alleging that it was negligent in failing to prevent Lo from engaging in the wrongful acts that resulted in their damages. RLI filed a complaint seeking a declaration that the coverage available for all of the underlying tort clams under American\u2019s policy of insurance was the aggregate limit of $3 million. American\u2019s counterclaim sought a declaration that coverage under its policy would be exhausted upon the payment of its per occurrence limit of $1 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\"><em>Discussion: </em>The parties contend that in Massachusetts, as in the majority of jurisdictions having decided the issue, the number of occurrences is determined by the \u201ccause\u201d theory, which construes occurrence \u201cby reference to the cause or causes of the injury or damage rather than the number of claims.\u201d <em>Doria </em>v. <em>Insurance Co. of N. America, </em>210 N.J. Super. 67, 73-74 (1986) (citing cases; Annot., 55 A.L.R.2d 1300, 1303 [1957]; and 15A Couch on Insurance \u00a7 56.21 [2d ed. 1983]). Although aspects of the cause theory do appear to have been adopted by our courts, this does not answer the question, as evidenced by the parties\u2019 disagreement as to what constitutes the cause in this case: RLI argues that the cause of the injuries here was Lo\u2019s shooting, whereas American takes the position that the conduct of the college and its employees in allegedly failing to prevent the shooting was the cause. We therefore precede our discussion of the ultimate issue \u2014 the number of occurrences \u2014 with a discussion of what determines the \u201ccause\u201d of injury in this context. We emphasize that when we speak in this opinion about cause of injury we are referring to that cause or occurrence that gives rise to insurance coverage. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>This may or may not be the same as the cause or causes of injury for purposes of tort liability.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">We conclude that when the issue is the number of occurrences, we must look to the \u201ccause\u201d of the injury by reference to the conduct of the insured for which coverage is afforded, and that \u201ccause\u201d and \u201coccurrence\u201d are indistinguishable for purposes of this analysis.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Our view is supported both by the terms of the relevant policy of insurance and by decisional law.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">American\u2019s policy provides general liability coverage for \u201cthose sums that the Insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of \u2018bodily injury\u2019 . . . caused by an \u2018occurrence,\u2019\u201d with occurrence defined as an \u201caccident, including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Specifically excluded is coverage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>for bodily injury that is \u201cexpected or intended from the standpoint of the Insured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">In this case, where the underlying claims against the school and its employees are for negligence, it is their allegedly negligent acts or omissions in failing to prevent Lo from using his gun that constitute the occurrence for purposes of determining general liability coverage provided by American\u2019s policy. See, e.g., <em>Washoe County </em>v. <em>Transcontinental Ins. Co., </em>110 Nev. 798, 804 (1994), a case where the employee of a private day care facility licensed by the county allegedly abused children at the facility. The plaintiffs in the underlying action alleged that the county was negligent in the process of licensing the facility. The court held that, for purposes of determining the county\u2019s insurance coverage, the county\u2019s negligence was the cause of the children\u2019s injuries. \u201c[Ejven though the action of the individual wrongdoerQ [is] the most direct causeQ of harm for the victims ... the actions of the individual wrongdoer[] taken alone are not the basis of liability .... Instead, liability . . . is premised on the [county\u2019s] negligence in performing a duty, which permitted the intervening conduct of [the wrongdoer] who actively caused the victims\u2019 harm.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">A similar analysis obtained in <em>Worcester Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Fells Acres Day Sch., Inc., </em>408 Mass. 393 (1990), a case involving policies of insurance containing definitions of \u201coccurrence\u201d substantially identical to the one at issue here.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> As in <em>Washoe County, supra, </em>the case in <em>Fells Acres </em>involved coverage related <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>to the abuse of children at a day care center by the facility\u2019s employees. In determining that there could be insurance coverage for acts of negligence by the school and its employees, the Supreme Judicial Court relied on \u201cconventional negligence theory,\u201d 408 Mass. at 410, focusing on the insureds\u2019 negligence in the hiring, retention, and supervision of the employees who committed the assaults. <em>Id. </em>at 407-411.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Thus, in <em>Fells Acres, </em>as in <em>Washoe County, </em>and, as we conclude, in the matter at hand, it is an insured\u2019s actions or failures to act (here the alleged negligence) and not the deliberate acts of a wrongdoer that constitute the \u201ccause\u201d of the victims\u2019 injuries. See also Aylward, Multiple \u201cOccurrences\u201d \u2014 A Divisive Issue, 5 Coverage 39, 40 (Jan./Feb. 1995) (\u201cwhere the insured\u2019s conduct was remote to the immediate cause of the plaintiff\u2019s injuries, as in products liability cases or theories of liability based on negligent training, supervision or inspection, the direct cause of injury may have little relevance to the \u2018cause\u2019 for purposes of ascertaining the number of \u2018occurrences\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">As Judge Weinstein observed in <em>Uniroyal Inc. </em>v. <em>Home Ins. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number><em>Co., </em>707 F. Supp. 1368, 1383 (E.D.N.Y. 1988),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> \u201cSince the policy was intended to insure [the college] for its liabilities, the occurrence should be an event over which [the college] had some control. Otherwise, with the covered risks out of the insured\u2019s hands and coverage for losses determined by the acts of the unfettered [shooter], the insurer would have no basis for setting premiums <em>ex ante </em>and the insurance contract would be illusory.\u201d Other jurisdictions have similarly held that \u201c[i]n interpreting coverage for . . . entities [such as the college here] under the \u2018causal\u2019 approach, \u2018occurrence\u2019 should be defined in such a way as to give meaning to the entity\u2019s connection to liability.\u201d <em>Washoe County </em>v. <em>Transcontinental Ins. Co., </em>110 Nev. at 805. Cf. Windt, Insurance Claims and Disputes \u00a7 11.3, at 298 (4th ed. 2001) (\u201cwhether an accident is present should be considered from the point of view of the insured\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">In addition to determining whether conduct of an insured constitutes an insured risk under a general liability insurance policy, we also look to such conduct to answer the question whether there was a single occurrence or multiple occurrences for purposes of determining \u201cper occurrence\u201d liability of an insurer.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We therefore look to the alleged acts of the insured college and its employees in failing to prevent Lo from engaging in the shooting spree as determining the number of occurrences, and not to the acts of Lo himself. By way of illustration, we turn to <em>Travelers Indem. Co. </em>v. <em>Olive\u2019s Sporting Goods, Inc., </em>297 Ark. 516 (1989), a case involving facts similar to those before us. There, the insured store allegedly sold a pistol and shotgun to one Wayne Crossley, who then used the weapons to shoot a police officer and kill and wound several others, before committing suicide. The court focused on the insured in deciding the issue of the number of occurrences, and determined that the occurrence was the sale of weapons, noting that \u201c[t]o decide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>that each of the injuries required separate coverage under the policy would in effect put a no-limit policy into effect.\u2019\u2019 <em>Id. </em>at 522. Compare <em>State Farm Lloyds, Inc. </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>960 S.W.2d 781, 785 (Tex. Ct. App. 1997) (where insured shooter was covered by his homeowner\u2019s policy, \u201cthe insured\u2019s liability arose out of the shootings\u201d). Thus, it is with reference to the conduct of the college and its employees that we now determine the question of the number of occurrences under American\u2019s policy of insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">As we observed earlier in this opinion, occurrence is defined in American\u2019s policy as an \u201caccident, including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions.\u201d \u201cThe term \u2018occurrence\u2019 that appears in the policies was used by the insurance industry instead of the term \u2018accident\u2019 beginning in the 1960\u2019s. The term \u2018occurrence\u2019 was adopted \u2018to dispel any existing notion that [coverage] was limited to sudden happenings.\u2019 \u201d <em>Worcester Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Fells Acres Day Sch., Inc., </em>408 Mass. at 416. The unambiguous language of American\u2019s policy, considered in the light of this historical backdrop, clearly contemplates the possibility that multiple acts taking place over a space of time may contribute to a single occurrence for purposes of coverage. We do not read <em>Fells Acres </em>as requiring the conclusion that the acts of the college and its employees constituted multiple occurrences. The court in that case, noting that there were allegations of \u201cnumerous discrete acts of . . . negligence . . . and breach of duty\u201d resulting in, or that failed to prevent, the abuse of the children over a lengthy period of time by multiple defendants in various locations, held that \u201c[t]hese allegations preclude the possibility that there was but a \u2018single, ongoing cause\u2019 of the injuries alleged.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 417. Nor does <em>Slater </em>v. <em>United States Fid. &amp; Guar. Co., </em>379 Mass. 801 (1980), require a different result.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">There is nothing in the agreed upon facts to suggest that any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>of the acts or omissions on the part of the insured defendants was a \u201cdiscrete\u201d act of liability so separated by time and location as to warrant the conclusion that each such act resulted in Lo having access to a weapon that he then used to shoot several people. Unlike in <em>Fells Acres, </em>it cannot be said that each alleged act of negligence \u25a0 resulted in a discrete injury. Rather, all the negligent acts combined to result in Lo\u2019s eighteen-minute rampage. Cf. <em>Appalachian Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>676 F.2d 56, 59, 61 (3d Cir. 1982) (primary issue was when occurrence took place, but court also noted that where policy defined \u201coccurrence\u201d as an \u201caccident or happening or event or a continuous or repeated exposure to conditions which unexpectedly and unintentionally results in . . . injury,\u201d the insured\u2019s policy contemplated \u201cmultiple and disparate impacts on individuals and that injuries may extend over a period of time,\u201d and held that discriminatory employment policy constituted a single occurrence). Although several events have been described as leading to Lo\u2019s shooting spree (e.g., the failure to search Lo\u2019s room, to confiscate his weapons parts, to call Lo\u2019s parents, to call the police), these facts do not describe separate occurrences, but rather constitute evidence of an arguably inadequate policy of security and student supervision that may have contributed to Lo\u2019s ultimate access to a murder weapon. It is this alleged failure or inadequacy of the college\u2019s policy that forms the basis of the insureds\u2019 liability here, and constitutes a single occurrence for insurance coverage purposes.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">The cases relied on by RLI, see, e.g., <em>American Indem. Co. </em>v. <em>McQuaig, </em>435 So. 2d 414 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1983); <em>State </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number><em>Farm Lloyds, Inc. </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>960 S.W.2d at 784-785, are inapposite. In these cases, the multiple, discrete acts of an insured, whose shooting of several people was separated (albeit briefly) by time was found to constitute more than one occurrence. There, unlike in the instant case, the shootings were the \u201ccause\u201d because conducted by the insured.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The conduct of the gunman, and not any negligent act or failed policy of supervision, was the relevant conduct in determining the number, of occurrences within the meaning of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">We conclude that the underlying claims in this case arose from a single occurrence under the terms of American\u2019s policy, limiting American\u2019s liability to $1 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b318-7\">That the distinction is important is particularly evident in this discussion about the number of occurrences. Confusion can arise when, as is often the case in opinions discussing the issue, the language of tort liability is called upon to inform the language of insurance risk coverage. In this case, for example, RLI\u2019s position \u2014 that the number of occurrences is determined by reference to the immediate cause of the victim\u2019s injuries, i.e., Lo\u2019s shooting \u2014 is based upon the assumption that \u201ccause of injury\u201d is that cause which, in a tort liability sense, is the immediate cause of harm, albeit not the exclusive proximate cause. This ignores the fact that the issue to be determined is not liability, but the contractual obligation of an insurer to an insured. See discussion, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b318-8\">\u201cCause\u201d and \u201coccurrence\u201d in this context are not to be confused with the \u201ctrigger of coverage\u201d issue, which identifies the time of the occurrence for purposes of determining whether a claim falls within the policy period of a particular contract of insurance. \u201c[I]t is important to distinguish concepts of cause and effect as they relate to the related purposes of determining which policy applies and how many policy limits are triggered. A liability policy is not \u2018triggered\u2019 by the happening of an \u2018occurrence.\u2019 Rather, it is triggered at the point in time when an \u2018occurrence\u2019 results in bodily injury or property damage.\u201d Aylward, Multiple \u201cOccurrences\u201d \u2014 A Divisive Issue, 5 Coverage 39 (Jan./Feb. 1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b318-9\">The American policy provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-10\">\u201cCOVERAGE A.

The court thus had to distinguish between the actions of the insureds as assailants (herein, wrongdoers), and the allegedly negligent actions of the insureds in their other capacities, excluding their own acts of abuse. The court determined that there was no insurance coverage for the wrongdoers\u2019 assaults on the victims, holding that, as matter of law, none of the claims of sexual assault of the minor plaintiffs was covered because the children\u2019s injuries necessarily were expected or intended from the point of view of the insured/wrongdoer (and therefore did not result from an accident or occurrence within the meaning of the policy). <em>Worcester Ins.

See, e.g., <em>Worcester Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Fells Acres Day Sch., Inc., </em>408 Mass. at 417 (multiple occurrences in light of time, space, and the number of defendants and acts of abuse). Cf. <em>Slater </em>v. <em>United States Fid. &amp; Guar. Co., </em>379 Mass. at 806-807 (noting that multiple occurrences have been found \u201cwhen the cause is interrupted, either by an independent cause, or by the actor regaining control over the causing factor\u201d). We think that the issue must in each instance be determined by the facts of a given case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b324-7\">In <em>State Farm Lloyds, Inc. </em>v. <em>Williams, supra </em>at 785, the court noted that \u201cthe insured\u2019s liability arose out of the shootings .... [The victims] were not injured by a single shot. Rather, their injuries resulted from two separate acts. Because each \u2018act\u2019 independently gave rise to liability, we conclude the shootings constituted two separate occurrences under the policy.\u201d In <em>Mc-Quaig, </em>the insured\u2019s shooting of two sheriifs, firing at three separate intervals separated by brief spans of time, was held to constitute three separate occurrences. <em>American Indem. Co. </em>v. <em>McQuaig, supra </em>at 415.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
