(Tri-County), appeals from a decision of the District Court affirming the decision of the board of review of the division of employment and training (board) to grant unemployment benefits to Denise Y. Lawrie (Lawrie). The board, in overturning a decision of the review examiner, concluded that Lawrie terminated her employment at Tri-County voluntarily, but for good cause, \u201cdue to sexual harassment and the resultant creation of an intimidating, humiliating and sexually offensive work environment,\u201d within the meaning of G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 25(e).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\"><em>Facts. </em>We offer a brief summary of the facts, based upon the undisputed findings of the review examiner, adopted in full by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>the board, supplementing from that source where context requires. Lawrie was hired iii 1996 as a shift manager in a residence for emotionally troubled adolescents operated by TriCounty in Northampton. On November 22, 1997, in connection with her duties, Lawrie took two Tri-County clients on a shopping trip. While driving a company van, Lawrie was sexually assaulted by one of the clients, a fourteen year old male. Lawrie promptly reported the assault to her superiors. Without objection, but with no assistance from Tri-County, Lawrie reported the assault to police and pressed charges. Lawrie\u2019s assailant was arrested and placed into the custody of the Department of Youth Services (DYS). On December 4, 1997, Lawrie\u2019s supervisor informed her that her assailant would probably be returned to Lawrie\u2019s work site, with a \u201cstay-away\u201d order in place.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\">On December 10, 1997, Lawrie\u2019s assailant admitted delinquency to sexual assault, was adjudicated delinquent, and was placed on two years\u2019 probation. The court also ordered the juvenile to stay away from Lawrie and to have no contact with her. Later that day, with the assent of Tri-County, DYS returned the juvenile to the same residential facility where Lawrie worked. After discussion with her superiors, Lawrie resigned her position, effective January 7, 1998, giving as the reason her dissatisfaction with her employer\u2019s handling of the sexual assault incident. On December 15, 1997, at a meeting with her supervisor, Lawrie was informed that Tri-County had decided to make her resignation effective immediately. Lawrie made application for unemployment benefits, which were granted. TriCounty appealed, and a review examiner denied the benefits; Lawrie applied to the board\u00bb for a review of the examiner\u2019s decision. The board, concluding that the examiner\u2019s decision was based on an error of law, modified the examiner\u2019s decision and awarded Lawrie benefits for the week ending December 27, 1997, and for subsequent weeks. Tri-County then petitioned the District Court to vacate the board\u2019s decision. From a judgment affirming the board\u2019s decision, Tri-County appeals to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\"><em>Standards of review. </em>The standards of review applicable to findings and decisions of the board are established in the employment security statute, G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 42; pursuant to the statute, the State Administrative Procedure Act, G. L. c. 30A, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>\u00a7 14, controls. Where our review is governed by the Act, we are required to give \u201cdue weight to the experience, technical competence, and specialized knowledge of the agency, as well as to the discretionary authority conferred upon it.\u201d G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7), as amended by St. 1973, c. 1114, \u00a7 3. See <em>Raytheon Co. </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>364 Mass. 593, 595 (1974). We review the record \u201cto determine whether the board applied correct legal principles in reaching its decision.\u201d <em>Guarino </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>393 Mass. 89, 92 (1984). We look \u201cto discover whether [the decision] contains sufficient findings to demonstrate that correct legal principles were applied, and [we] must review the record to determine whether those findings are supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Ibid., </em>citing <em>Lycurgus </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>391 Mass. 623, 626-627 (1984). \u201c[I]f an agency\u2019s finding of fact is supported by \u2018such evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion,\u2019 it will not be disturbed by a reviewing court.\u201d <em>Raytheon Co. </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>364 Mass. at 595, quoting from G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 1(6), as inserted by St. 1954, c. 681, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">As to interpretation of statutes governing the agency, we defer to the agency\u2019s interpretation and application of the statute within which it operates. See <em>Hotchkiss </em>v. <em>State Racing Commn., </em>45 Mass. App. Ct. 684, 691-692 (1998). Where the agency\u2019s rules are concerned, the agency\u2019s interpretation is entitled to great weight, unless those interpretations are \u201carbitrary, unreasonable or inconsistent with the plain terms of the rule itself.\u201d <em>Finkelstein </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Optometry, </em>370 Mass. 476, 478 (1976). However, pure questions of law are \u201csubject to de nova judicial review.\u201d <em>Raytheon Co. </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>364 Mass. at 595. See G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\"><em>Sufficiency of the evidence. </em>Tri-County does not dispute that the findings of fact adopted by the board are supported by substantial evidence. Rather, it argues that the board (in adopting without change the findings of the examiner, but reaching the opposite conclusion from those findings) did not have sufficient evidence with which to conclude Lawrie had resigned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>due to sexual harassment under G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 25(e), and therefore she had not satisfied the burden of showing that she left with good cause attributable to the employer. Applying the standards set forth in <em>Guarino </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>393 Mass. at 92, discussed earlier, we conclude that the board\u2019s findings were neither inconsistent with the board\u2019s conclusion that Lawrie had been subject to sexual harassment, creating a hostile, humiliating, or sexually offensive work environment, nor unsupported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">More specifically, the conclusion that Lawrie left due to sexual harassment, and the examiner\u2019s (and the board\u2019s) finding that she \u201cleft her job because of dissatisfaction with the employer\u2019s handling of [the] sexual assault incident,\u201d are not inconsistent. The board specifically found that Lawrie had been sexually assaulted by her employer\u2019s client, and that this client had been criminally prosecuted and ordered to stay away from Lawrie. From these specific material subsidiary findings, the board could draw the reasonable inference that Lawrie was subject to an \u201cintimidating, hostile, humiliating and sexually offensive work environment\u201d when her assailant returned to the same facility where she worked and that Tri-County made \u201cno . . . effort\u201d to stop the creation of such an environment. In so doing, Tri-County ran afoul of G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 <em>25(e), </em>fourth and fifth pars, (see note 2, <em>supra). </em>This conclusion accords with the finding that Lawrie left her employment because she was dissatisfied with the way her employer handled the sexual assault, and it supports the further determination that her resignation was involuntary, with good cause attributable to Tri-County.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">The board\u2019s conclusion in this regard was also consistent with the finding that Lawrie would not have had \u201cany problems in performing her job duties\u201d even if her assailant was returned to the facility wherein she worked. It is not inconsistent for an employee to be able to perform job duties but still be working within a hostile, humiliating, and sexually offensive environment. Further, Tri-County\u2019s argument, that Lawrie failed to raise the sexual harassment issue with the initial examiner, or with the board, is contradicted by the record. Lawrie\u2019s application for further review and her counsel\u2019s oral argument to the examiner, that Tri-County\u2019s stance in taking back the offending <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>client without \u201canything in the works\u201d for a transfer for Lawrie, were sufficient, in our view, to raise the issue that TriCounty had created a work environment that was sexually hostile.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\"><em>Burden of proof. </em>We reject Tri-County\u2019s argument that Lawrie failed to sustain her burden of proof. Generally, it is the employee\u2019s burden, under G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7 25(e) (see note 2, <em>supra), </em>to show that the employee left work involuntarily with good cause attributable to the employer, and that \u201che or she took reasonable steps to preserve his or her employment . . . , unless the circumstances indicate that such efforts would be futile or result in retaliation.\u201d 430 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 4.04(5)(c)(3)(b) (1997).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In cases involving allegations of sexual harassment, however, the claimant need not show that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>she took all or even \u201creasonable steps\u201d to preserve her employment. The requirement is expressly excluded by G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 25(e), fourth par. (see note 2, <em>supra), </em>and 430 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 4.04(5)(c)(3) (see note 3, <em>supra). </em>Contrast <em>Guarino </em>v. <em>Director of Div. of Employment Security, </em>393 Mass. at 93-94 (in case of harassment due to union activities, claimant for unemployment benefits must make reasonable attempts to correct that situation). Hence, while the board explained that \u201cthe findings suggest [Lawrie] may not have taken all necessary measures to preserve her employment prior to resigning,\u201d under the statute and regulation Lawrie was not required to show that she had taken such measures.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\">It appears Lawrie would have sustained her burden even under the more stringent requirement. As noted, in its decision, the board concluded that Tri-County was aware of the existence of the harassment, and that, given the seriousness of the offense, it should have taken affirmative steps to transfer Lawrie permanently to another job site, but no such effort was made. The board further concluded that, given the extent of its \u201ccontrol over the non-employee\u2019s [client\u2019s] conduct,\u201d see 430 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 4.04(5)(c)(l)(b) (note 3, <em>supra), </em>Tri-County was unreasonable in expecting Lawrie to work in the same residential facility that housed the person who assaulted her. Implicit here is the board\u2019s determination that nothing in the facts found by the examiner required that Tri-County accept the return of the client, or that he be housed in the same unit where Lawrie worked. To the extent that it could have refused the client\u2019s return, or have housed him in a different facility, TriCounty had control over the client\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">Tri-County further contends in this context that the board erred because it did not consider the fact that, when the client returned, he was subject to a court order to stay away from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>Lawrie. This argument is unavailing; in coming to its decision the board adopted the examiner\u2019s findings of fact, which contained several references to the client\u2019s return subject to a stay away order. Merentially, all facts found by the examiner and adopted by the board were considered by it in reaching its decision. We see nothing here that would cause us to conclude that the board acted in a manner that was arbitrary or capricious. While recognizing that the factual findings reflected some possible effort on TriCounty\u2019s part to offer Lawrie a transfer to a location where clients were female, we could not conclude that, on the record before it, the board\u2019s determination \u2014 that Tri-County\u2019s efforts in this regard were insufficient \u2014 was arbitrary or capricious.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\"><em>Risk inherent in employment. </em>We address Tri-County\u2019s further argument that we are under obligation to consider \u201cthe absolute fact that [Lawrie] was hired to work with youths at risk, kids [who] were emotionally disturbed, victims of severe physical and sexual abuse and adolescent sex offenders,\u201d and that the conduct she experienced was not only a foreseeable risk of the job, but \u201cclearly a reasonable probability given the client population served.\u201d Tri-County\u2019s argument suggests that Lawrie\u2019s assuming the risk of sexual assault mitigated the effect of 430 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 4.04(5)(c)(l)(b) and \u00a7 4.04(5)(d) (see note 3, <em>supra), </em>diminishing the board\u2019s ability to apply these regulations to her situation. Tri-County never advanced this argument before either the board or the District Court, and \u201ca <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>party is not entitled to raise an argument on appeal that was not raised before the administrative agency.\u201d <em>Boston Neighborhood-Taxi Assn. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>410 Mass. 686, 693 (1991). We consider the issue, however, as it may recur and has broader policy implications. See <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>400 Mass. 826, 828 &amp; n.4 (1987); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Oakes, </em>407 Mass. 92, 94 n.4 (1990); <em>Catlin </em>v. <em>Board of Registration of Architects, </em>414 Mass. 1, 7 n.7 (1992); <em>Foley </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>429 Mass. 496, 497-498 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">Tri-County\u2019s argument must fail, as it leads to the untenable conclusion that possible criminal sexual assault is the price that an employee must pay to maintain employment, and that, if the employee is unprepared to accept the \u201creasonable probability\u201d of such occurrences on the job, then leaving after such an incident means leaving without good cause. The section of the employment security law dealing with sexual harassment, G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 25(e), fourth par. (see note 2, <em>supra), </em>suggests no such limitation on an employee\u2019s eligibility for benefits when the employee leaves for reasons of sexual harassment. Further, 430 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 4.04(5)(a)(2)(a) (see note 3, <em>supra), </em>by explicit language, defines sexual harassment in part as being subject to sexual conduct as \u201ca term or condition of employment.\u201d While an employee may accept employment knowing of the possibility of the risk of sexual assault, leaving employment because of sexual assault cannot be made a basis for denial of benefits under the employment security act, if the employer does not take appropriate measures to ameliorate the situation. As the board determined, the possibility of sexual assault in the workplace places a heavy burden on the employer to take steps to create a situation favorable to the employee, and in the absence of such effort benefits will be payable. In the face of the statutory language and the thrust of the regulations, we cannot say that the board\u2019s determination in this regard was arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">We note as well that the Legislature has, as a matter of social policy, abandoned the concept of assumption of the risk in negligence cases. Thus, if Lawrie had decided, upon contracting for employment, to retain the right to bring an action against the employer based on common law principles, rather than to accept coverage under the Worker\u2019s Compensation Act, G. L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>c. 152, \u00a7 66, would \u201cproscribe[ ] voluntary or contractual assumption of the risk as a defense\u201d in any suit brought by her as \u201can employee in connection with a work-related injury.\u201d <em>Gonsalves </em>v. Commonwealth, 27 Mass. App. Ct. 606, 609 (1989). See <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Leighton, </em>385 Mass. 757, 760 (1982). More generally, in 1973, the Legislature amended the comparative negligence statute, G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 85, as appearing in St. 1973, c. 1123, abolishing assumption of the risk as a defense in negligence actions. See <em>Forte </em>v. <em>Muzi Motors, Inc., </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. 700, 704 n.7 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">For those public employees especially susceptible to assaults, such as police, correction officers, or employees of State mental hospitals, there is a special statutory provision to compensate them for suffering such assaults <em>in addition </em>to their receipt of workers\u2019 compensation. See G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 58; <em>Chambers </em>v. <em>Lemuel Shattuck Hosp., </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. 211, 211-212 (1996); <em>Moog </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 925, 925-926 (1997). While these employees could be said to \u201cassume the risk\u201d of working in such less-then-desirable conditions day after day, by explicit reference to such risks in their contracts of employment, they do not, by statute, assume the risk in the sense that they receive no compensation for foreseeable injury in the line of duty. Further, the public sector employer could still be held liable for failing to do all that is possible to make the working conditions as safe as possible against sexual assaults in accordance with G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 <em>25(e).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">Those employed in the private sector, although fulfilling duties similar in nature to some described above, are not entitled to the additional compensation provided by G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 58. It does not follow, however, that they should suffer the risk of loss of unemployment benefits occasioned by the type of employment they accept.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">From the record, Tri-County\u2019s argument in this regard faces an additional acclivity. Tri-County has in place a detailed protocol for the \u201cRisk Management and Treatment of Adolescent Sex Offenders,\u201d precisely to exert appropriate control over the behavior of clients like the assailant. This protocol states, \u201cWe believe the specialized assessment and treatment performed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>those who are trained in working with adolescent sex offenders is 0\u00bfc] the first step to be taken if sexual assault and its consequences are to be addressed properly. We assume a responsibility to protect the safety and well-being of other clients, many of whom are victims, and Tri-County staff from the possibility of victimization of those who have been identified as sexual offenders.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The existence of this protocol suggests that Tri-County has acknowledged the responsibility of shielding its employees from risk. The protocol\u2019s existence further supports the board\u2019s determination that Tri-County failed in its duty to make suitable arrangements for Lawrie\u2019s protection and continued employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\">The District Court judge did not err in affirming the decision of the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b434-9\">The statute, as amended through St. 1992, c. 26, \u00a7 19, provides, in its first paragraph, that \u201cno benefits shall be paid to an individual . . . after the individual has left work . . . voluntarily unless the employee establishes by substantial and credible evidence that he had good cause for leaving attributable to the employing unit or its agent. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b434-10\">The fourth and fifth paragraphs of \u00a7 25(e) provide as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b434-11\">\u201cAn individual shall not be disqualified, under the provisions of this subsection, from receiving benefits if it is established to the satisfaction of the commissioner that the reason for leaving work and that such individual became separated from employment due to sexual, racial or other unreasonable harassment where the employer, its supervisory personnel or agents knew or should have known of such harassment.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-12\">\u201cFor the purposes of this paragraph, the term \u2018sexual harassment\u2019 shall mean sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature when (a) submission to or rejection of such advances, requests or conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of employment or as a basis for employment decisions; (b) such advances, requests or conduct have the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual\u2019s work performance; or (c) such advances, requests or conduct have the purpose or effect of creating an intimidating, hostile, humiliating or sexually offensive work environment The department shall promulgate regulations necessary to carry out the provisions of this paragraph.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b434-13\">For the pertinent accompanying regulations, see note 3, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b438-5\">Title 430 Code Mass.

Despite this lack of obligation on Lawrie\u2019s part, the record discloses that Lawrie and her supervisor, Elizabeth Skelton, discussed the possibility of a transfer, even if Lawrie did not specifically request a transfer or shift change. Again, according to the record, investigation into this possibility, prior to Lawrie\u2019s decision to resign, was stunted by Skelton\u2019s legitimate need to take leave due to a death in her family. Regardless, Skelton\u2019s own supervisor testified that a transfer to the female facility was not an option, and a transfer to the other male facility would pose further problems since Lawrie\u2019s assailant\u2019s brother lived at that facility. Hence, even, if Lawrie had been required to meet the \u201creasonable steps\" requirement, which she was not, the board properly could have concluded on the record as a whole that any \u201creasonable attempt [by Lawrie] to correct that situation . . . would have been futile.\u201d <em>Guarino </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. oEmployment Sec., </em>393 Mass. at 93.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b443-6\">We cannot determine from the record when this protocol was first adopted. Lawrie testified that she had never seen the document until the hearing.
