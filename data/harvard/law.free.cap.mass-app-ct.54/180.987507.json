The Appellate Tax Board held correctly that the appellant\u2019s claimed \u201cinterest\u201d expenses could not be treated as deductions from gross income in respect to the net income measure of the appellant\u2019s tax, nor could the note figure as a liability in calculating the net worth measure.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-13\"><em>Narrative. </em>1. In 1985, appellant Overnite Transportation Company (Ovemite), a Virginia corporation, was the largest LTL tracking company \u2014 hauling less than full truckloads \u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>in the country. The company had had robust revenue growth over the previous ten years, with average increases of about 17% per year. At the end of the period it was debt free except for a relatively insignificant amount. Union Pacific Corporation (Union Pacific), owner of railroads as well as a variety of other businesses, became interested in Overnite because of the advantages possibly achievable from the movement of freight by trucks and rail in cooperative or synergistic fashion.</p>\n<p id=\"A5U\">In October 1986, Union Pacific, with money it borrowed for the purpose largely from banks, made a successful tender offer to Ovemite\u2019s shareholders of $43.25 per share, a total cost of $1.2 billion. The stock had been selling in the market in 1985 at a low of 12<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>/s to a high of 21<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>/s. The value of Ovemite\u2019s assets as shown on its 1985 balance sheet was around $300 million (the figure $343 million appears in the 1986 annual report of Union Pacific). Thus Union Pacific was paying a premium of 200% to 400% of the share trading value, and about $900 million over the value of Ovemite\u2019s assets.</p>\n<p id=\"Ag9l\">The purchase became effective as of November 1, 1986, subject to approval by the Interstate Commerce Commission. This was given in October, 1987. Ovemite then adjusted its books, increasing the amount listed on its balance sheet for \u201cintangible assets\u201d from $491,061 to $904,515,009, which, with other adjustments, caused its net worth<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to appear on its 1987 balance sheet as rising from about $300 million to $1.2 billion. The leap reflected Union Pacific\u2019s cost of acquiring the shares but, as indicated by Harold Diggs, Ovemite\u2019s executive director of taxes, the outlay was extraneous and did not as a matter of substance increase Ovemite\u2019s assets or net worth.</p>\n<p id=\"AFLe\">On December 12, 1988, Union Pacific organized Ovemite Holding, Inc. (Holding), a Delaware corporation, retained the Holding shares, and made a \u201ccapital contribution\u201d to Holding of the shares of Ovemite. So Ovemite emerged a wholly owned subsidiary of Holding, and Holding a wholly owned subsidiary of Union Pacific.</p>\n<p id=\"Aa5-\">On December 29, 1988, Ovemite voted a dividend in favor of Holding in the amount of $600 million, payable in the form <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>of a note,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and, the next day, issued the note, the short text of which appears in the margin.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The note promised payment of $600 million in 1998, ten years after issuance, and began to accrue quarterly interest commencing on March 31, 1989, at rates equal to the rates charged by Union Pacific from time to time for its intercompany advances. The words of the note were regular in form but, by reason of omissions, the note was unusual in substance. The note did not recite any consideration for the promises, nor did Ovemite receive any. The note was not secured by any Ovemite assets, and there was no provision for a sinking fund or reserve, for any required partial payments or redemption of the principal, or for measures to enforce payments or to deal with defaults.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">In 1987, as requested by Union Pacific, Ovemite had prepared a forecast of the net income it might earn in the years 1988 through 1993. By the calculations of Dr. Ralph Kimball, Overrate\u2019s expert witness, Ovemite would have been able to support the interest and retire the principal at maturity if the 1988-1993 forecast had proved accurate and the company\u2019s net income grew after 1993 at an assumed average rate of 10%. Unhappily, Ovemite realized neither its own forecast nor Kimball\u2019s growth assumptions, both summarized below. In fact the only year in which the company met (actually exceeded) the estimate was 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">Year Net Income Forecast (in millions) Net Income Earned (in millions)</p>\n<p id=\"A3Y\">1988 $50.3 $58</p>\n<p id=\"ANGe\">1989 $60.2 $48</p>\n<p id=\"AEr\">1990 $71.4 $56</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>1991 $83.0 $33</p>\n<p id=\"Ak6\">1992 $98.0 $60</p>\n<p id=\"ApQ\">1993 $117.3 -$15</p>\n<p id=\"AuF\">1994 $129.0 $64</p>\n<p id=\"Afz\">1995 $141.9 -$10</p>\n<p id=\"A-P\">1996 $156.1 -$23</p>\n<p id=\"AAg\">1997 $171.7 $24</p>\n<p id=\"AFx\">1998 $188.9 N/A<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A6O1\">Total $1,267.8 $295</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">Commencing on March 31, 1989, Ovemite began transferring funds to Holding (which passed them to Union Pacific in the form of dividends). Although the note purportedly established quarterly payment dates of March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31 of each year, Ovemite did not adhere to this schedule. There were four months in which a transfer was due but not made. There were twenty-three months in which no transfer was due but a transfer was made. There was one month in which Holding transferred funds to Ovemite. For no quarter did Ovemite pay the amount of interest purportedly due in that quarter, most times transferring significantly less, occasionally more. From the beginning, Ovemite was in arrears on its interest payments. As shown in the table below, from March 1989 through December 1993, the shortfall was $48 million (17% of total accrued interest); from March 1994 through December 1997, it was $48 million (24% of total); and overall from March 1989 through December 1997, it was $96 million (20% of total).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">Year Interest Interest Amount Amount in Rate Accrued Transferred Arrears (by year) (by year) (cumulative)</p>\n<p id=\"A13\">1989 10% $60,328,767 $38,644,281 $21,684,486</p>\n<p id=\"AD4h\">1990 9% $55,693,861 $56,288,196 $21,090,151</p>\n<p id=\"ARl\">1991 9% $57,327,280 $26,114,849 $52,302,582</p>\n<p id=\"AOu\">1992 9% $59,468,234 $74,722,013 $37,048,803</p>\n<p id=\"A1H\">1993 8.5% $55,439,259 $44,393,400 $48,094,662</p>\n<p id=\"ASj\">1994 7.50% $49,661,367 $45,444,688 $52,311,341</p>\n<p id=\"Ata\">1995 7.50% $50,257,848 $41,935,366 $60,633,823</p>\n<p id=\"b212-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>1996 7.50% $51,348,798 $33,483,322 $78,499,299</p>\n<p id=\"AGC\">1997 7.50% $52,844,968 $34,981,610 $96,362,657</p>\n<p id=\"A2H\">1998 N/A N/A N/A N/A</p>\n<p id=\"Alh\">Total \u2014 $492,370,382 $396,007,725 $96,362,657</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">It remains to say that Ovemite never undertook to repay any part of the principal of the note. When the note came due in 1998, Holding forgave the remaining unpaid interest along with $400 million of the principal and Ovemite issued to Holding a new note of $200 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-12\">2. Starting with the tax year 1988 and in each subsequent year, Ovemite accounted for the note to Holding on its corporate excise tax return as a liability, and in 1989 began deducting from its gross income the total amount of interest it claimed it owed for each year. See G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 30(4), as amended by St. 1992, c. 133, \u00a7\u00a7 401, 595.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This had the effect of lowering Overnite\u2019s taxable net income<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> apportioned to Massachusetts under G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 38(c). So also, treating the note as indebtedness reduced the company\u2019s net worth for purposes of calculating the net worth (\u201cnon-income\u201d) measure of the tax. See G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 30(9) (the \u201cnet worth of a foreign corporation ... shall be [a certain percentage, determined by formula,] of the book value of its total assets less its liabilities on the last day of the taxable year\u201d), inserted by St. 1962, c. 756, \u00a7 2. For the tax years 1988 through 1993 here in question, the result was a reduction by a total of $569,734 of the tax Overnite would otherwise have had to pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-29\">In February 1992, the defendant Commissioner of Revenue (commissioner) began auditing Ovemite\u2019s returns and eventoally, on April 21, 1996, the Commissioner sent Ovemite a notice of assessment (NOA) for the tax years 1988 through 1990 ($205,440) and on October 3, 1996, an NOA for the tax years 1991 through 1993 ($364,294) (a total of $569,734, exclusive of interest).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>Ovemite, questioning the assessments, conferred with the commissioner\u2019s audit division. This resulted, on March 19, 1996, in issuance by the departmental appeal and review bureau of a letter opinion holding the note did not constitute genuine indebtedness and the assessments were well grounded. The bureau stressed the factors that the note was not issued in consideration of any new funds, the note was unsecured, and the company appeared unable to retire the principal of the note without liquidating a substantial part of its assets. The bureau concluded that any purported interest transfers to Holding necessarily were \u201cexcessive\u201d in the sense of G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 39A,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and properly disallowed as deductions.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">Ovemite timely filed applications for abatement, which were denied by the commissioner. Appeal to the Appellate Tax Board (board) followed. The board held a hearing on January 7, 1999. The parties tendered a statement of facts. Witnesses for the taxpayer were Diggs and Kimball, through whom sundry exhibits were introduced. The commissioner cross-examined, and entered further exhibits. The board\u2019s findings of fact and report, dated August 13, 1999, after analyzing the facts, said in agreement with the appeal and review bureau it was \u201cunpersuaded that any reasonable expectation [of payment] attended the Note transaction here.\u201d The board found Holding\u2019s failure \u201cto enforce its full and timely interest entitlement at any point over the life of the Note\u201d was strongly \u201cindicative of concern for an equity investment,\u201d quoting from <em>Bordo Prods. Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>476 F.2d 1312, 1325 (Ct. Cl. 1973). Finally, the circumstances attending the note impaired \u201cthe credibility of potential business reasons for structuring the Note transaction as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>debt.\u201d From the board\u2019s decision, Ovemite takes its appeal to this court. In the discussion which follows, we avail ourselves of the detailed reasoning of the bureau and board.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>In pursuit of the question whether the note was tme debt, there is need to consider not only the text but the circumstances of issuance and performance. See <em>New York Times Sales, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Rev., </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 749, 752 (1996); <em>Alternan Foods, Inc. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>611 F.2d 866, 872 (Ct. Cl. 1979). It may not be presumed that such an arrangement between subsidiary and controlling parent is automatically disqualified as a debt, see <em>Kraft Foods Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Int. Rev., </em>232 F.2d 118, 124 (2d Cir. 1956), yet the self-dealing involved calls for \u201cclose scrutiny,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 123, in which characterizations appearing on the books should not be blandly accepted.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> When \u201cthe same persons occupy both sides of the bargaining table, form does not necessarily correspond to the intrinsic economic nature of the transaction, for the parties may mold it at their will with no countervailing pull.\u201d <em>Fin Hay Realty Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>398 F.2d 694, 697 (3d Cir. 1968). To the extent of the deviation of the transaction from the core definition of debt, the claim of an actual debtor-creditor relationship is put in question. See <em>New York Times Sales, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Rev., </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. at 752-753; <em>Kraft Foods Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Int. Rev., </em>232 F.2d at 123; <em>P. M. Fin. Corp. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Int. Rev., </em>302 F.2d 786, 789 (3d Cir. 1962). We may accept as such definition \u201can unqualified obligation to pay a sum certain at a reasonably close fixed maturity date along with a fixed percentage in interest payable regardless of the debtor\u2019s income or lack thereof.\u201d <em>Gilbert </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Int. Rev., </em>248 F.2d 399, 402 (2d Cir. 1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-34\">Like other courts in similar situations we circumambulate the transaction to see it from several points of vantage and thus to find its essential nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number><em>Acquisition. </em>Overnite was restructured in 1987 with a purported net worth of (roughly) $1.2 billion, which the draftsmen seem to have tried to justify as the original company\u2019s net worth of around $300 million plus the premium of $900 million paid by Union Pacific to acquire the shares of Ovemite. No part of Union Pacific\u2019s outlay passed to Ovemite and the company\u2019s economic position was unchanged, as Diggs acknowledged. The result was that the supposed debt of $600 million represented by the unsecured note issued by Ovemite in favor of Holding could be supported only by a hope (or weakly grounded expectation) that Overnite would prove so profitable as to bear the burdens of interest and ultimately principal over the ten years to 1998. The risks of underachievement were considerable and could be recalled with sorrow as the nominal obligations fell due. Holding (with Union Pacific standing behind Holding) appears, not in actuality a creditor, but the sole shareholder of Ovemite awaiting returns on investment, which may as well be called future \u201cdividends.\u201d <em>See Affiliated Research, Inc. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>351 F.2d 646, 648 (Ct. Cl. 1965) (if \u201crepayment of . . . advances is dependent upon the success of the recipient corporation, this suggests that the amounts were in fact an equity investment\u201d); <em>Slappey Drive Indus. Park </em>v. <em>United States, </em>561 F.2d 572, 581 (5th Cir. 1977) (a \u201cperson ordinarily would not advance funds likely to be repaid only if the venture is successful without demanding the potential enhanced return associated with an equity investment\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\"><em>Promissory note. </em>The note in its spare style was blank on a number of points that would be covered by specific provisions in a bona fide note, especially one of this size. And, most remarkably, the maker Ovemite was not in fact receiving (borrowing) money, it was simply promising to pay on stated terms. The explanation now offered for leaving the promises without security, reserve, provision for enforcement, and so forth is that these precautions were needless and would be merely formal where \u201cdebtor\u201d and \u201ccreditor\u201d were closely related \u2014 indeed, in practice, one and the same. But this makes the point that the note was not such in truth; at most it was a kind of conduit for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>what the very corporate resolution called it, a \u201cdividend\u201d in favor of the initial investor.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">Asked whether he knew of any instance where a corporation issued its own unsecured obligations to a parent as a dividend which was then allowed for tax purposes as indebtedness, Kimball cited the aforementioned case of <em>Kraft Foods Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Int. Rev., </em>232 F.2d 118, 124 (2d Cir. 1956). Kimball, however, had not looked into the details. As the board noted, \u201c[I]n that case, by contrast [with the present] ... the amount of the debt was well within the debtor\u2019s capacity to pay\u201d \u2014 in fact, the corporation remained current, making all required payments, and, it may be surmised, the debentures involved could have been sold for hard cash. See <em>Commissioner of Int. Rev. </em>v. <em>T. R. Miller Mill Co., </em>102 F.2d 599, 600 (5th Cir. 1939) (corporation\u2019s declared surplus distribution to shareholders in form of note absolute in terms with fixed interest rate, corporation remaining current on interest obligations: interest payments held properly deducted). Contrast <em>Gregg Co. of Del. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Int. Rev., </em>239 F.2d 498, 500-502 (2d Cir. 1956), cert. denied, 353 U.S. 946 (1957) (notes could not be treated as debt for tax purposes where corporation issued notes to family members without receiving new capital and subsequently paid on notes from surplus earnings and only as corporatian deemed it advisable).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-23\"><em>Performance. </em>There has been argument that all that should count was the intention or frame of mind of the parties at the time of the launching of the note. So far as that intention is at all ascertainable, it seems not to help the taxpayer: in argument intention promptly translates into a claim that the parties could have believed Ovemite would prosper for an indefinite period at a rate resembling that of the past, before the restructuring. And so we are remitted to what was reasonably foreseeable, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>thence to what in fact happened. \u201cWhat may appear to be a debtor-creditor relationship from dealings viewed within a certain span of time may turn out to be a mirage when later transactions are taken into account. The circumstances surrounding disbursements in later years and their cumulative effeet may be considered in determining a taxpayer\u2019s intent prior to those years.\u201d <em>Alterman Foods, Inc. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>611 F.2d at 872, quoting from <em>Estate of Taschler </em>v. <em>United States, </em>440 F.2d 72, 77 (3d Cir. 1971). As the board remarked, \u201c[t]he extent of the risk was borne out in the irregularity and erratic amounts of interest payments, beginning the first time appellant\u2019s obligatian fell due.\u201d As to the subsequent lamentable history of defaults, the board added, \u201cthe long foreseeable risk of non-repayment of the Note was realized when appellant failed to repay or rollover two-thirds of the $600 million amount upon maturity. Indeed the history of default in meeting interest obligatians would all but foreclose the prospect of a rollover of the Note by a disinterested lender.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Ac9\"><em>Third party lender. </em>Compelled by the view expressed in <em>Scriptomatic, Inc. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>555 F.2d 364, 367 (3d Cir. 1977), Overnite states in its brief, \u201cDoubtless the most important factor in analyzing the Note is the evidence that a third party creditor would have made a loan to Ovemite on the terms of the Note.\u201d What is assumed here is a hypothetical independent lender willing to make a ten-year advance of $600 million in cash to Ovemite without exacting security in specific assets of the company (at best the approximately $300 million).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Although some loans are made \u201con signature,\u201d see <em>State St. Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Reiser, </em>7 Mass. App. Ct. 633, 634 (1979), the absence of provision for security in a loan of this scale is telltale that a \u201cloan\u201d is not real, see <em>Affiliated Research, Inc. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>351 F.2d at 648-649; <em>Roth Steel Tube Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Int. Rev., </em>800 F.2d 625, 631 (6th Cir. 1986); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>and so, also, for the absence of meaningful enforcement mechanisms. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Snyder Bros. Co., </em>367 F.2d 980, 984-985 (5th Cir. 1966), cert. denied, 386 U.S. 956 (1967); <em>Texas Farm Bureau </em>v. <em>United States, </em>725 F.2d 307, 314 (5th Cir. 1984), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 1106 (1985). To this should be added the admission that at no stage, from the beginning, did Ovemite have the ability to meet the principal requirements of the note. Prior to the restructuring, Ovemite had never earned annual net income as much as the note\u2019s nominal interest requirements. \u201c[A] loan is made upon the reasonable assumption that it will be repaid no matter whether the business venture is successful or not,\u201d <em>Cuyuna Realty Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>382 F.2d 298, 301 (Ct. Cl. 1967); that does not appear to have been the case here. It more likely appears that Ovemite intended to satisfy its obligations under the note only when and as circumstance conveniently permitted. Agreeing with the board, we think the hypothetical willing lender could not be found in the flesh. The point can also be made by asking whether anyone could be found to buy the existing note from Holding (or Union Pacific) and at what point in time and at what discount.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\"><em>Expert witness. </em>Characteristic of Kimball\u2019s testimony was that it made little progress in responding with particulars to the question of the independent lender. Kimball rather spent considerable time showing by various ratios<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> that Ovemite\u2019s \u201cdebt\u201d after the restructuring was not out of proportion to its equity when measured against the like figures for comparable tracking companies. The witness, however, had not paid attention to whether the debt for the other companies resulted from an actual borrowing of cash, or whether there were any instances where the \u201ccreditor\u201d was related to or was the counterpart of the \u201cdebtor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">Also problematic was Kimball\u2019s inclusion in his assessments of some $900 million in unspecified \u201cintangible assets\u201d (representing nearly 70% of Ovemite\u2019s total claimed value). It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>has been observed that \u201cintangible assets . . . have no place in assessing debt-equity ratio unless it can be shown by convincing evidence that the intangible asset has a direct and primary relationship to the well-being of the corporation.\u201d <em>Plantation Patterns, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Int. Rev., </em>462 F.2d 712, 723 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 409 U.S. 1076 (1972). The only showing here was to the contrary. The board also was concerned with Kimball\u2019s discounting of Overnite\u2019s actual unfortunate earnings history (as opposed to the forecasts) and his lack of explanation for Folding\u2019s failure to enforce its rights. The board thus found Kimball\u2019s opinions largely unpersuasive and of only \u201climited assistance in resolving the debt vs. equity question\u201d and others at hand. The board\u2019s decision to disregard much of Kimball\u2019s testimony was amply supported and within its discretion.

Kimball spoke in general terms about restructuring a corporation so as to achieve a proper relation between equity and debt<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> \u2014 this testimony offered to suggest that the Ovemite transaction had a business objective which might bear on tax liability. Kimball\u2019s observatians lose their cogency where so-called \u201cdebt\u201d turns out not to be such in reality. As already noted, see note 10, <em>supra, </em>were the \u201cdebt\u201d here to be taken as genuine, it would impose a dubipus burden on the company. In fact the debt was a misnamed or scantily disguised means by which Overnite transferred funds through Holding to Union Pacific to enable this original investor to recoup its equity investment.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number><em>Conclusion. </em>The taxpayer having failed to carry its burden of showing that the note constituted indebtedness and the transfers to Holding qualified as deductible interest expense, the decision of the Appellate Tax Board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b209-40\">As used in this discussion, \u201cnet worth\u201d means the book value of Over-nite\u2019s total assets less its liabilities.

See <em>Affiliated Research, Inc. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>351 F.2d at 648-649 (unsecured advances made by stockholder to corporation were not loans but investments); <em>Roth Steel Tube Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Int.

An arms-length loan would have left Ovemite with \u00e1 substantial amount of cash to devote to business expansion. However, the Note placed Ovemite under a heavy interest obligatian requiring uninterrupted double-digit growth, but without new cash to fuel the expected performance. This fact makes the Note seem unlike other debts, and casts doubt on reasonableness of expectation of repayment.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b218-7\">The debt-to-equity ratio; current ratio (measuring liquid assets against current liabilities); quick ratio (a more conservative form of the current ratio essentially considering cash and cash equivalents); and the ratio of earnings before interest and taxes to annual interest expenses (a measure of cash flow and the ability of a company to meet interest obligations).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"Ak6E\">Kimball suggested that a corporation might restructure as Ovemite here did to help its parent achieve a desired return on investment; to realize the theoretically lower cost to the corporation of debt vis-\u00e1-vis equity; to limit the amount of capital potentially at risk in the corporation in the event of a catastrophic transportation-related accident; and to obtain a better reflection of the restructured corporation\u2019s actual performance. As the board observed, Kimball denied that he knew what Overnite\u2019s actual business purposes might have been in structuring the transaction as it did, and he only tangentially tied his academic observations to Ovemite\u2019s circumstances.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
