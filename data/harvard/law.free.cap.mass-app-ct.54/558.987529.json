What began as a mutually convenient arrangement \u2014 Neihaus had a one-year overseas job assignment, and the Maxwells needed temporary housing while their new home was under construction \u2014 degenerated into litigation when the Maxwells refused to vacate the house after Neihaus\u2019s return and the expiration of the lease term.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">On September 25, 1998, Neihaus brought a summary process action against the Maxwells who, in turn, filed a counterclaim alleging violations of G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 15B, and G. L. c. 93A. After trial, a judge of the Worcester Housing Court entered judgments for Neihaus on both his complaint and the Maxwells\u2019 counterclaim. The present appeal is by the Maxwells from the disposition of their counterclaim. At issue is whether Neihaus and his agent complied with those subsections of G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 15B, as amended through St. 1992, c. 133, \u00a7 522, which govern the receipt, holding, and return of tenant security deposits by residential landlords.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">The pertinent facts may be summarized as follows. At the inception of the lease, the Maxwells paid Neihaus\u2019s agent, Hunneman Residential Services, $2,450 representing the last month\u2019s rent and another $2,450 as a security deposit against damage to the premises. Hunneman deposited that money into its \u201cSecurity Deposit Account,\u201d a single account at a Massachusetts bank, in which Hunneman held security deposits and last months\u2019 rents for all of Hunneman\u2019s residential landlord clients.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">Hunneman used an internal accounting system which, the trial judge found, was adequate to track the various deposits that were placed in the pooled Security Deposit Account. Hunneman also maintained a separate landlords\u2019 operating account into which it deposited the rent received on behalf of Neihaus and from which it paid the expenses associated with Neihaus\u2019s property, such as the mortgage, property taxes, water and sewer charges, and repair and maintenance costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-8\">Although the Maxwells remained in possession after the expiration of the lease and paid rent for August, they failed to make a monthly rent payment for September, 1998. Hunneman, therefore, withdrew the last month\u2019s rent from the Security <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>Deposit Account and used it as payment for the Maxwells\u2019 use and occupancy of the property during September. The following month, by court order, the Maxwells made a rent payment of $2,450 for October, as a condition of obtaining a continuance of the summary process trial. On October 22, 1998, the judge ordered that judgment for possession of the property enter for Neihaus; he ruled against the Maxwells on their counterclaims; and he required Neihaus to return the Maxwells\u2019 security deposit with interest and to pay the Maxwells interest on the last month\u2019s rent that they had advanced at the inception of the lease. It is undisputed that Neihaus promptly made these payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">The Maxwells\u2019 primary contention is that their security deposit was illegally commingled with funds belonging to Neihaus and exposed to claims by Neihaus\u2019s creditors, in violation of \u00a7 15B(l)(e),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and not held in an appropriate, separate bank account, in violation of \u00a7 15(B)(3)(a),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> thereby entitling them to an award of three times the security deposit plus interest, costs and attorney\u2019s fees, pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 15B(6) and 15B(7).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We agree with the trial judge that the Maxwells\u2019 claim is without merit, because Hunneman\u2019s method of holding the security deposit for Neihaus did not run afoul of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>The security deposit provisions of G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 15B, are designed to insure that tenant monies are protected from potential diversion to the personal use of the landlord, earn interest for the tenant, and are kept from the reach of the landlord\u2019s creditors.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> These objectives were met in this case. The deposit was placed in a bank account that was maintained separately from the landlord\u2019s operating account containing Neihaus\u2019s own funds; the accounting system utilized by Hunneman kept track of the deposit, distinguished it from other funds in the account and enabled a proper computation of the interest due to the Maxwells; and, because the security deposit was separately designated in this manner, it could not be attached: a creditor could not make the requisite showing that these separately identified funds were due to Neihaus absolutely and without contingency. See G. L. c. 246, \u00a7 24; <em>Goodspeed\u2019s Book Shop, Inc. </em>v. <em>State Street Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>8 Mass. App. Ct. 147, 149 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-4\">Although the Maxwells are correct that last months\u2019 rents are, with certain limitations, the property of the landlord, not the tenant,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> in the circumstances of this case Hunneman\u2019s place-o ment of security deposits in a pooled account along with last months\u2019 rents did not constitute prohibited commingling. We do not underestimate the importance of the statutory prohibition on commingling, which is often the first step towards personal use of entrusted funds, whether by accident or design. Cf. <em>Matter of the Discipline of an Attorney, </em>392 Mass. 827, 836-837 (1984). But, in this case, whether it was required to do so or not, Hunneman kept last months\u2019 rents unavailable for use by or on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>behalf of the landlord until due and owing, at which time they were transferred out of the Security Deposit Account. Thus, the risk inherent in commingling \u2014 that a landlord might intentionally or inadvertently use tenant funds when accessing the commingled account to pay operating or other personal expenses \u2014 simply did not exist here.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">The Maxwells also claim that Neihaus was required to return their security deposit within thirty days of the expiration of the written lease-on August 31, 1998, even though they remained in possession of the property until the end of October. This, they argue, was a violation of G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 15B(6)(&lt;?).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Again, we agree with the trial judge that Neihaus\u2019s obligation to return the Maxwells\u2019 security deposit within thirty days did not arise at the expiration of the written lease but, rather, when they relinquished possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">An important purpose of security deposits is \u201cto provide a source of funds for the payment of the cost of repairs for which a tenant is responsible.\u201d <em>Jinwala </em>v. <em>Bizzaro, </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. 1, 7 (1987). It would not be in keeping with this purpose were othe statute interpreted to require return of a security deposit before the tenant vacates the premises. It also would be incongruous to confer upon tenants at sufferance, like the Maxwells, greater rights than accrue to tenants at will, who are not due their security deposits until thirty days after the termination of their occupancy of the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">Finally, the Maxwells contend that Neihaus is liable under G. L. c. 93A for alleged multiple violations of G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 15B, and regulations promulgated by the Attorney General that designate various security deposit transgressions as unfair and deceptive acts and practices. See 940 Code Mass. Regs. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>\u00a7 3.17 (1993). It may be that Neihaus and Hunneman were not fully in compliance with law in one respect: neither provided the Maxwells with the name or location of the account containing the Maxwells\u2019 security deposit, as required by G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 15B(3)(a), and 940 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 3.17(4)(d) (1993). Even if c. 93A otherwise provides a remedy for this misstep, and we need not so decide, Neihaus nevertheless cannot be liable under that statute, because he was not engaged in trade or commerce with respect to the isolated rental of his home while he was temporarily living overseas. See <em>Lantner </em>v. <em>Carson, </em>374 Mass. 606, 610-611 (1978); <em>Billings </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>397 Mass. 614, 615-616 (1986); <em>Young </em>v. <em>Patukonis, </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. 907, 910 (1987). The mere fact that he used a professional real estate agent to assist him with the rental did not convert what was patently a personal, private transaction into a business activity. See <em>Lantner </em>v. <em>Carson, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">The judgment for Neihaus on the Maxwells\u2019 counterclaim is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b588-6\">\u201cA security deposit shall continue to be the property of the tenant making such deposit, shall not be commingled with the assets of the lessor, and shall not be subject to the claims of any creditor of the lessor or of the lessor\u2019s successor in interest, including a foreclosing mortgagee or trustee in bankruptcy; provided, however, that the tenant shall be entitled to only such interest as is provided for in subsection <em>(3)(b).\u201d </em>G.

The landlord must give the tenant an annual statement of interest earned and either remit the interest at the end of each year of tenancy or permit the tenant to deduct the interest from the next rental payment. If the tenancy is terminated before its anniversary date, the landlord must pay the accrued interest within thirty days of the termination to avoid exposure to liability for treble damages, \u25a0 costs, and attorney\u2019s fees.
