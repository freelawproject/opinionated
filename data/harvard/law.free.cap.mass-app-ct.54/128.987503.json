See G. L. c. 23, \u00a7\u00a7 1-3, as amended by St. 1996, c. 151, \u00a7\u00a7 111, 112; G.

See Mass.R.Civ.P. 23, 365 Mass. 767 (1974). Certification of a proposed class was denied on February 21, 1995. The action continued on behalf of the named plaintiffs; later, there was a certification of a newly defined class, as described below.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-10\">The principal questions presented on appeal are whether the Department of Employment and Training (department) had correctly concluded that certain plaintiffs, former employees of Digital Equipment Corporation (Digital) who were discharged as a result of a reduction in force between 1990 and 1993, were disqualified from receiving unemployment insurance benefits, and, if the department was in error, whether the plaintiffs\u2019 later motion for the intervention of Ben Root as the representative of a proposed new class of claimants, and for the certification of that class, was properly allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-11\">1. <em>Case history. </em>Following a jury-waived trial on stipulated facts, a final judgment was entered in the Superior Court on February 10, 1998, disposing of numerous issues presented by the parties and declaring, insofar as material to this appeal, that the department was in error in ruling that unemployment benefits were unavailable to the former Digital employees because of their receipt of Digital\u2019s separation package referred to below. The final judgment also ordered further proceedings to identify and pay those persons who were denied benefits for the above reason but were otherwise entitled to them. See note 14, <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b157-12\">The department appealed solely from the portion of the final judgment declaring that the separation package (referred to as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>the transitional financial support option, or \u201cTFSO,\u201d the material provisions of which are described <em>infra) </em>paid to the discharged plaintiffs did not constitute disqualifying \u201cremuneration\u201d under G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 l(r)(3).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As an alternative basis for their position, the plaintiffs cross-appealed from that provision of the judgment declaring that the decision of this court in <em>White </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Dept. of Employment and Training, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 249 (1996), discussed below, may not be given \u201cretroactive\u201d effect. No other issues were presented on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>In this court, at the oral argument on November 18, 1999, threshold questions arose as to whether the controversy had become moot. Following oral argument, the parties agreed upon the need to expand the record on appeal, and they filed a joint motion to remand the case to the Superior Court. We allowed the motion, accepting the parties\u2019 identification of three issues to be decided on remand, which we set out in the margin,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and we entered a remand order on December 2, 1999, retaining jurisdiction of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">Upon remand to the Superior Court, the plaintiffs, on August 7, 2000, intending to respond to the remanded issues, moved to bring in two new plaintiffs, Ben Root and Robert Soler, and for class certification of two classes, Class A and Class B, with Root and Soler, respectively, as class representatives of the two new classes. Class A plaintiffs were defined in essence as those persons who were separated from the employ of Digital under the terms of the TFSO agreement, and who applied for, and were denied, unemployment insurance benefits. Class B plaintiffs were those persons who were terminated pursuant to the TFSO agreement, but \u201cwho were directly or indirectly discouraged from filing claims for UI benefits prior to March 7, 1993.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">The judge\u2019s memorandum and order dated August 15, 2001, allowed the motion as to Root and Class A, and denied the motion as to Soler and Class B. In his order certifying Class A, the judge referred to the final judgment he had previously entered; he wrote, \u201cthe participation of Class A was obviously contemplated by this Court.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The plaintiffs did not claim an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>appeal from the denial of the certification of Class B.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">In a supplementary order dated September 27, 2001, following the judge\u2019s decision just described, we limited the parties\u2019 supplementary briefs, to be filed for reargument, to the two issues decided by the judge following remand, namely, the allowanee of the plaintiffs\u2019 motion to permit the intervention of Ben Root, together with the certification of Class A (with Root as representative) on the ground that the receipt of the TFSO package was not a disqualifying event for the receipt of unemployment benefits; and the disallowance of the plaintiffs\u2019 motion to permit the intervention of Robert Soler and the certification of Class B. The plaintiffs have abandoned their motion insofar as it deals with Soler and Class B, and we proceed to discuss the merits of this controversy.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b160-16\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>We consider first the certification of Class A, as described in the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for certification of a revised class: \u201cThose persons who were laid off by Digital Equipment corporation, pursuant to the Transitional Financial Support Optian (TFSO) separation agreement, applied for Unemployment Insurance (UI) benefits prior to the end of their TFSO payments period and were denied UI benefits by the [department] . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b160-24\">The TFSO package did not, as the department argues, constitute disqualifying \u201ccontinuation pay\u201d within the holding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>of <em>Itek Corp. </em>v. <em>Director of Div. of Employment Security, </em>398 Mass. 682 (1986). In <em>Itek, </em>the company\u2019s plan for the benefit of discharged employees kept them on the company payroll with payment of salary, at the regular intervals, <em>following </em>termination for a period of months determined by reference to the employee\u2019s length of service with the company. <em>Id. </em>at 683. Additionally, the salary payments \u201cwould cease if the employees were to find other employment within a certain time span.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 685. The court referred to the arrangement as a \u201csalary continuation plan,\u201d that is, a plan for the continuation of salary, without any current services being rendered to the company, during a predetermined period and in consideration of services rendered in the past. <em>Ibid. </em>The plan was held, under clause (1) of \u00a7 l(r)(3), see note 3, <em>supra, </em>to be disqualifying remuneration to the employee because it was consideration received by an individual \u201cfrom his employing unit for services rendered to such employing unit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 686, quoting from G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 l(r)(3)(l). This consideration for services rendered in the past represented \u201can acknowledgment by the employer of the employee\u2019s faithful performance of his duties.\u201d The court also wrote that the \u201cLegislature did not intend that unemployment compensation serve as a supplemental income for those receiving their regular salaries.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">In the case before us, employment terminated on the date of the TFSO agreement; the monies received by the discharged employees under the TFSO package were to be paid \u201cas soon as reasonably feasible\u201d in one lump sum in an amount based in part on the employee\u2019s years of continuous service, and were due regardless of whether or when the discharged employees found new employment. There were no provisions for any further services, or for the continuation of salary or other periodic cash payments. Unlike that in <em>Itek, </em>the payment here was not paid out like salary, nor was it designed to be paid out during the period of unemployment. The TFSO package could not be described as a \u201csalary continuation plan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">A quite separate point is decisive. The discharged employees were informed by memorandum (the caption read, \u201cSUBJECT: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>INVOLUNTARY REDUCTION IN FORCE \u2014 EMPLOYEE NOTICE\u201d) that \u201c[i]n order to receive the benefits under TFSO, you will be required to sign the Transition Financial Support Agreement, a copy of which is also enclosed .... <em>Failure to sign the TFSO Agreement and return it, postmarked no later than SEPTEMBER 25, 1992, will result in the termination of your employment without the benefits''\u2019 </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">The TFSO agreement provided in careful detail that acceptance of the TFSO package constituted \u201cfull and complete satisfaction\u201d of all claims the employee then had, or ever had, against Digital and all \u201cits officers, directors, agents, successors, assigns or employees.\u201d The TFSO agreement then stated that the \u201ceffect\u201d of signing the agreement was \u201cto prevent [the] Employee from suing\u201d any of the parties released, whether under the common law or under any State, Federal or local law (many of which are identified in the agreement), or \u201cany other claim arising out of [the] Employee\u2019s employment with Digital or termination of employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">In this respect, the case before us presents the same facts as those appearing in the decision of this court in <em>White </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Dept. of Employment &amp; Training, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 249 (1996) \u2014 although there was no class action in <em>White. White </em>involved the same TFSO package as is involved in this case:<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> a lump sum payment based in part on the employee\u2019s years of service with Digital; continued medical, dental, and life insurance during the relevant period; and the condition that the employee would receive nothing unless he signed a general release of all claims.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">Relying on <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Digital Equip. Corp., </em>868 P.2d 1170 (Colo. Ct. App. 1994), which involved an \u201calmost identical\u201d TFSO package, we held in <em>White </em>that the cash payment and insurance benefits were not made in return for past services, but in return for the general release of all claims, with the result that the employee accepting the TFSO package and signing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>general release did not thereby receive disqualifying payments. <em>White </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Dept. of Employment &amp; Training, supra </em>at 252-254. More particularly, we wrote that in <em>Moore </em>\u201cthe employee\u2019s consideration for the agreement was not services[,] but the release of any claim that he might have against \u2018the employer itself or against described third parties,\u2019 or, as provided in the agreement before us, [Digital\u2019s] officers, directors, agents, successors, assigns or employees.\u201d We added that \u201cthe primary purpose of such payment [under the TFSO] is to obtain such release.\u201d <em>White </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Dept. of Employment &amp; Training, supra </em>at 254, quoting from <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Digital Equip. Corp., supra </em>at 1173. Had Digital\u2019s primary purpose been to provide a salary substitute, the payment \u201cwould not have been conditioned on the employee\u2019s execution of the written release.\u201d <em>White </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Dept. of Employment &amp; Training, supra </em>at 253, quoting from <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Digital Equip. Corp., supra </em>at 1172. For these reasons, the TFSO package did not, as the department argues and as the Superior Court declared, constitute \u201cseverance pay.\u201d (See note 3, <em>supra, </em>for a description of the limited statutory periods during which \u201cseverance pay\u201d was a disqualifying event).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\">The plaintiffs argue that the <em>White </em>decision should be given \u201cretroactive effect\u201d; the department insists it should not. The parties have carefully briefed the question, but we need not undertake a discussion of that complex issue.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We see no sound basis for departing from the reasoning and conclusion we reached in <em>White, </em>and we decline to do so.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The circumstances and the contractual arrangements in the <em>White </em>case and in the case before us are substantially identical. In <em>White, </em>there was no controlling authority; in this case we have the controlling author<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>ity of <em>White, </em>and as it is a well-reasoned decision, we will follow it.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">We hold that the receipt of a TFSO financial and benefits package upon the terms described in the TFSO agreement did not disqualify any recipient from receiving unemployment insurance benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">We turn to the allowance of the motion to intervene. The department makes several arguments regarding the judge\u2019s decision, after remand, to allow the intervention of Ben Root as the class representative of Class A members. The nub of the objection to Root is that he did not seek either a timely administrative appeal or judicial review of the denial of his claim.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> At an evidentiary hearing upon the return of the case to the Superior Court, see <em>infra, </em>it may appear that Root is vulnerable on that basis, and the department\u2019s point may not be lost. Should that occur, however, the plaintiffs would be allowed to substitute a new, qualified, class representative. Compare <em>Cleary </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Welfare, </em>21 Mass. App. Ct. 140, 147 (1985).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We see no abuse of discretion in the judge\u2019s certification of the class. See <em>Weld </em>v. <em>Glaxo Wellcome Inc., </em>434 Mass. 81, 84-85 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">The department\u2019s supplementary brief makes a brief reference to a bar presented by \u201cthe sovereign immunity doctrine.\u201d We address the point briefly. The doctrine \u201cprotects the public treasury against money judgments and public administration from interference by the courts at the behest of litigants except <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>in instances and by procedures the Legislature has authorized,\u201d <em>New Hampshire Ins. Guar. Assn. </em>v. <em>Markem Corp., </em>424 Mass. 344, 351 (1997), but the doctrine has no application to the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">The unemployment benefits system is funded by contributions from covered employers which are paid into the Commonwealth\u2019s Unemployment Compensation Fund, G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 48, and all such contributions must be deposited \u201cimmediately with the secretary of the treasury of the United States of America to the credit of the account of the commonwealth in the Unemployment Trust Fund.\u201d G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7 50. The State treasurer has the power to requisition funds from the Unemployment Trust Fund for the payment of benefits. G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 51. Under Federal law, a State\u2019s unemployment compensation system must ensure \u201cfull payment of unemployment compensation when due.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 503(a)(1). Inconsistent State practice must yield to this Federal \u201cwhen due\u201d clause. See <em>California Dept. of Human Resources Dev. </em>v. <em>Java, </em>402 U.S. 121, 129-133 (1971). Like the enforcement provisions of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988, for reasonable attorney\u2019s fees in certain cases, the Federal statute just described is designed to \u201covercome any inconsistent claim that a State official, as defendant, may advance under the banner of the sovereign immunity of the State.\u201d <em>Gaulin </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Welfare, </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. 744, 747, <em>S.C., </em>401 Mass. 1001 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">For the foregoing reasons, paragraph 5 of the final judgment (declaring that a TFSO package does not disqualify a recipient from receiving unemployment benefits) shall be modified to reflect that the TFSO package constituted neither separation pay not continuation pay and, as so modified, is affirmed. Paragraph 7 of the final judgment (declaring that <em>White </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Dept. of Employment and Training, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 249 [1996], \u201cdoes not have retroactive effect to the members of the TFSC group\u201d) is vacated as unnecessary to the determination of the parties\u2019 rights. Paragraph 6 of the final judgment (ordering the defendants, in cooperation with the plaintiffs, to proceed with the implementation of the approved class action), is affirmed along with the balance of the judgment. The case is remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings in ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>cordance with this opinion and with paragraph 6 of the final judgment, the text of which appears in the margin.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b158-5\">Paragraph (3) of \u00a7 l(r) currently defines the following as disqualifying \u201cremuneration\u201d for purposes of eligibility for unemployment compensation: under clause (1) of the paragraph, consideration received by an individual \u201cfrom his employing unit for services rendered to such employing unit\u201d; and, under clause (3), consideration received \u201cas termination, severance or dismissal pay, or as payment in lieu of dismissal notice.\u201d G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 l(r)(3), as amended through St. 1993, c. 19, \u00a7 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">The statutory history of clause (3) of \u00a7 l(r)(3) has been turbulent. As appearing in St. 1953, c. 635, \u00a7 1, clause (3) included as disqualifying \u201cremuneration\u201d the receipt of \u201cseverance payments\" or \u201cdismissal pay.\u201d The Legislature, by St. 1957, c. 632, <em>deleted </em>those last two phrases and substituted the phrase \u201cpayment in lieu of dismissal notice.\u201d See <em>Bolta Prods. Div., Gen. Tire &amp; Rubber Co. </em>v. <em>Director of Div. of Employment Security, </em>356 Mass. 684, 688-690 (1970) (receipt of \u201cseverance payments\u201d did not fall within \u201cpayment in lieu of dismissal notice\u201d and therefore was not disqualifying event). This last phrase \u2014 \u201cpayment in lieu of dismissal notice\u201d \u2014 was carried forward in St. 1976, c. 473, \u00a7 3. Contrast <em>Itek Corp. </em>v. <em>Director of Div. of Employment Security, </em>398 Mass. 682, 684-685 (1986) (holding that \u201csalary continuation plan\u201d paid to \u201cemployees on inactive status\u201d constituted disqualifying remuneration under clause [1] of \u00a7 l[r][3]).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">The 1992 statutory change, see St. 1992, c. 118, \u00a7 4, effective for claims filed after September 6, 1992, restored, in clause (3), to the definition of \u201cremuneration\u201d the phrase \u201ctermination, severance or dismissal pay,\u201d thereby restoring language used prior to 1957. Finally, St. 1993, c. 19, \u00a7 47, provided that clause (3) \u201cshall only be applicable to those claims filed on or after March seventh, nineteen hundred and ninety-three.\u201d The 1993 statute became effective March 9, 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">The evident effect of this sequence of statutory changes is that \u201cseverance pay\u201d was not a disqualifying event between 1957 and September 6, 1992. For claims filed between September 6, 1992, and March 7, 1993, \u201cseverance pay\u201d was a disqualifying event, but as of March 9, 1993, \u201cseverance pay\u201d was a disqualifying event only as to claims filed after March 7, 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-9\">The defendant acknowledges in its brief that \u201cmost TFSO claimants filed their unemployment claims before March 1993.\u201d In any event, for the reasons described below in our discussion of <em>White </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Dept. of Employment and Training, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 249 (1996), the TFSO package was not \u201cseverance pay.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b159-7\">The issues to be determined on remand, as described by the agreement of the parties, were (i) whether the Superior Court had authority to order the department to pay retroactive benefits to persons whose unemployment claims were denied and not appealed; (ii) whether any named plaintiff who had received a TFSO package filed a claim after March 7, 1993 (see note 3, <em>supra), </em>and if not, whether relief is available to members of the TFSO group filing claims after March 7, 1993; and (iii) the timing of the filing of unemployment claims by TFSO group members, as well as whether additional members of the TFSO group might move to' intervene as plaintiffs, and whether a motion for certification of a class of persons consisting of the TFSO group might be filed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b159-11\">The judge understandably took the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for the intervention of the two new class representatives, and the certification of the two new classes, as presenting the substantive issues identified in the joint remand motion. See note 4, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b160-26\">The judge decided not to follow precisely the original description of the issues to be decided upon remand. See note 5, <em>supra. </em>Neither party, by a motion for reconsideration in the Superior Court, sought to expand or modify the scope of the judge\u2019s decision to conform to the issues as originally described by the parties. Further, our decision to accept the judge\u2019s supplementary decision as the basis for our review is supported by the department\u2019s reply to the plaintiffs\u2019 second status report, dated September 28, 2001 (one day following the date of our supplementary order confining supplementary briefs to the issues decided by the judge following remand), wherein the department states that \u201c[t]he plaintiffs do not make any showing why further proceedings before the Superior Court on remand are necessary or why such proceedings would aid this Court in the exercise of its retained jurisdiction over the pending appeal, as set forth in its December 2, 1999 Order .... [T]he case should be returned to [the Appeals] Court now.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b160-40\">The balance of the text reads, \u201cor after appeal, but excluding those persons who also filed or reopened a claim for UI benefits after the end of their TFSO payments period and received the same amount of UI benefits they would have received if their initial UI application had been approved.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b162-8\">The department makes no claim that Digital\u2019s TFSO package in the <em>White </em>case was different from Digital\u2019s TFSO package in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b162-9\">It appears that the plaintiff in the <em>White </em>case filed his claim for benefits <em>after </em>March 7, 1993.

The Supreme Judicial Court directed that the plaintiffs be given leave to file an amended complaint in the Superior Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b164-9\">Furthermore, as the judge wrote, citing <em>Peabody Fedn. of Teachers, Local 1289, AFT, AFL-CIO </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Peabody, </em>28 Mass. App. Ct. 410, 413 (1990), a motion to intervene a new class representative is not necessarily untimely when filed after a final judgment. A transactionally related amendment to the complaint relates back to the date of the filing of the complaint, see Mass.R.Civ.P. 15(c), 365 Mass. 761 (1974), and, as to putative class members who wish to intervene, the statute of limitations is tolled upon the filing of the complaint. See <em>American Pipe &amp; Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>Utah, </em>414 U.S. 538, 554 (1974). See also <em>Crown, Cork &amp; Seal Co. </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>462 U.S. 345, 353-354 (1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b166-6\">Paragraph 6 of the final judgment reads in full as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-7\">\u201cThe defendants are ordered to take prompt and reasonable steps to locate, notify, and provide the opportunity to TFSO group members who were denied unemployment benefits on the basis of their receiving continuation pay to submit information regarding their eligibility for benefits, and thereafter to pay all otherwise eligible TFSO group members unemployment compensation in accordance with their eligibility. This Court retains jurisdiction on this issue and will hold a hearing on Tuesday, My 7, 1998, at 2 p.m. in the Suffolk C Session to review, in the case of claims of members of the TFSO group, plans for identifying and locating members whose unemployment claims were denied, giving them written notice of their eligibility and affording them prompt decisions and payment of benefits to which they are entitled. The parties will confer and make good faith efforts to reach agreement on such implementation plans.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">We note that the scheduled date of the hearing, as it now appears in paragraph 6, will have to be revised by the judge.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
