On January 7, 1993, while performing the duties of his job, a wooden staircase collapsed beneath him, causing him to fall six feet. He twisted his right knee when he landed on a cement foundation. The employee, who was thirty-six years old at the time of the accident, had a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>twenty-year history of problems with both knees, including multiple surgeries. Nevertheless, he had worked at his job at the MWRA continuously for eight years prior to the accident. He did not return to work after the accident. Although his treating doctors concluded that he was permanently disabled as a result of the accident, his application for accidental disability retirement was denied. On appeal, he claims that two members of the regional medical panel used the wrong legal standard in evaluating the relationship between the accident and his work. He argues that his case should be remanded to the Contributory Retirement Appeal Board (CRAB) and referred to a new medical panel for proper certification.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\"><em>The regional medical panel. </em>To qualify for an accidental disability retirement, an employee must be examined by a regional medical panel. See G. L. c. 32, \u00a7\u00a7 6(3)(a), 7(1); 840 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 10.08, 10.10 (1993). In addition to the examination, the medical panel reviews \u201cthe pertinent facts in the case, and such other written and oral evidence as the applicant and the employer may present.\u201d G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 6(3)(a). \u201cAt the conclusion of [this process] ... the panel shall certify to the [retirement] board in writing whether [the] physicians on [the] panel find [1] that [the employee] is mentally or physically incapacitated for further duty and [2] that such incapacity is likely to be permanent, and. . . shall state further [3] whether or not the disability is such as might be the natural and proximate result of the accident or hazard undergone on account of which retirement is claimed . . . <em>.\u2019\u2019Id. </em>Certification of affirmative answers to all three questions is a \u201ccondition precedent\u201d to accidental disability retirement. <em>Hunt </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>332 Mass. 625, 627 (1955). The medical panel or its individual members, see 840 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 10.10(2), (9) (1993), must also submit a separate narrative \u201cdescribing in detail the findings and recommendations of the report,\u201d as well as responding to certain other questions as instructed on the certificate form. 840 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 10.10(9) (1993). It is the relationship between the statutory questions set out on the certificate(s) and the accompanying narrative(s) that is at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">In this case, a regional medical panel was duly convened. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>After each physician conducted a separate physical examination, each completed a \u201cRegional Medical Panel Certificate\u201d issued by the Division of Public Employee Retirement Administration (PERA) (now the Public Employee Retirement Administration Commission, see G. L. c. 7, \u00a7 49, as amended by St. 1996, c. 306, \u00a7 1). Each doctor also submitted a \u201cnarrative\u201d in the form of a letter to PERA.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\"><em>The certificate form. A </em>\u201cnotice\u201d on the second page of the medical panel certificate form used in this case provided that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-6\">\u201cTHE MEDICAL PANEL\u2019S CERTIFICATE AND NARRATIVE ARE TO BE CONSIDERED AS EVIDENCE BY THE RETIREMENT BOARD. THEREFORE, IN ORDER TO ALLOW THE BOARD TO UNDERSTAND YOUR RESPONSES TO THE QUESTIONS, YOUR NARRATIVE REPORT SHOULD BE CLEAR, CONCISE AND CONSISTENT. A NARRATIVE REPORT WHICH DOES NOT FULLY SUPPORT THE CERTIFICATE RESPONSES MAY UNDERMINE THE WEIGHT OF THE MEDICAL PANEL REPORT.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">The instructions on the subsequent pages of the certificate informed the panel members that they were \u201cresponsible for answering the questions listed in [s]ections (F), (G), and (H), in addition to providing a written response in the form of a narrative report which supports the medical basis for the conclusion.\u201d The sections labeled (F), (G), and (H) each included one of the three statutory determinations set out in G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 6(3)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">In addition to posing the first statutory question, section (F) of the form directed the doctor completing the certificate to \u201ccomment and discuss in the narrative: [t]he DIAGNOSIS of the [employee\u2019s] condition and the nature of any incapacity or impairment, if any, as found by the panel and the MEDICAL BASIS for your conclusion.\u201d Section (G) had similar questions concerning the expected course of the disability. Section (H) was captioned \u201cCERTIFICATE FOR ACCIDENTAL DISABILITY.\u201d After setting out the third question, section (H) advised:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-9\">\u201cBefore responding, please consider and also discuss in the narrative:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>\u201cA. Whether there is any other event or condition in the [employee\u2019s] history, or in any other evidence provided to the panel, other than the personal injury sustained or hazard undergone upon which the disability retirement is claimed, that might have contributed to or resulted in the disability claimed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-5\">\u201cB. Whether it is more likely than not that the disability was caused by the condition or event described in (A) rather than the personal injury sustained or hazard undergone which is the basis for the disability claim, and the basis for your conclusion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">Following this, the accidental disability certificate set out the third question again, this time with spaces in which to check \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\"><em>Prior proceedings. </em>The panel unanimously answered the first two questions in the affirmative. As to the critical third question, two of the three doctors checked \u201cno\u201d on the certificate form. The State Board of Retirement voted to deny the employee\u2019s retirement \u201cbased on [the] report by the regional medical panel which conducted [the employee\u2019s] physical examination. . . . [The employee\u2019s] condition was not caused by or aggravated by [his] duties.\u201d See <em>Malden Retirement Bd. </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>1 Mass. App. Ct. 420, 423-424 (1973). The employee appealed to CRAB, which referred the matter to an administrative magistrate of the Division of Administrative Law Appeals. See G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 16(4). The magistrate held a hearing at which she received documentary evidence, heard argument, and considered the employee\u2019s claims. In affirming the decision of the retirement board, the magistrate stated that a majority of the single physician panel doctors had concluded that the employee had recovered from the January, 1993, injury to his right knee. In her five-page decision, she also observed that \u201cDrs. Gibbons and Little both impl[ied] in clear, documented and logical narratives that the [employee\u2019s] serious underlying condition was not aggravated by the [January] fall.\u201d CRAB adopted the findings and decision of the magistrate, adding that \u201ca majority of the Panel was of the . . . opinion, and the facts so indicate, that there was not a medical possibility of a causal relationship between [the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>employee\u2019s] disability and an accident or hazard undergone while in the performance of his duties.\u201d Further appeal to the Superior Court was unsuccessful. See G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\"><em>Issues on appeal. </em>On appeal to this court, the employee argues that the two members of the regional medical panel who answered the third question in the negative used the wrong legal standard in evaluating the impact of the accident. He claims that rather than determining whether the accident \u201cmight\u201d have caused the employee\u2019s disability, these doctors instead gave definitive opinions on the ultimate question whether the accident actually played such a role. Relying on <em>Noone </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>34 Mass. App. Ct. 756, 762 (1993), the employee contends that the doctors acted in excess of their authority and that therefore the certificates, and CRAB\u2019s decision relying on them, were based on an error of law. G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\"><em>Standard of review. </em>It is the employee\u2019s burden to prove that he has a permanent and total disability that is \u201cthe natural and proximate result of a personal injury sustained as a result of the performance of his duties as [a diesel operator].\u201d <em>Blanchette </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 479, 483 (1985). Consistent with well-established principles of administrative law, we give considerable deference to CRAB\u2019s expertise, according \u201c \u2018great weight\u2019 to CRAB\u2019s interpretation and application of the statutory provisions it is charged with administering.\u201d <em>Lisbon </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. 246, 257 n.10 (1996), quoting from <em>Namay </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 456, 463 (1985). In paying such deference, we are mindful that this is a \u201cdifficult area of the law,\u201d <em>Blanchette </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., supra </em>at 487, that is \u201cnotoriously complex.\u201d <em>Namay </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., supra. </em>See <em>Noone </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., supra </em>at 763 n.11.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-13\"><em>Discussion. Noone </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., supra, </em>on which the employee relies in support of his argument that there was an error of law, has not heretofore been cited for the particular principle the employee urges on us here. We therefore review <em>Noone </em>in some detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>We begin with the procedural posture of that case. Paul Noone was a Superior Court probation officer who sought an accidental disability retirement on the ground that various manifestations of his heart disease , were related to incidents at work. <em>Id. </em>at 756-757. The regional medical panel answered the third statutory question in the negative. The State Board of Retirement denied Noone\u2019s application. <em>Id. </em>at 758. On the employee\u2019s appeal to CRAB, an administrative magistrate made extensive findings of fact. She concluded there were three defects in the regional panel\u2019s certificate: reliance on risk factors, factual error related to one of the risk factors, and failure to consider a doctor\u2019s report (which the panel apparently did not have). She recommended that the case be remanded to a new medical panel. <em>Id. </em>at 760. CRAB purported to adopt the magistrate\u2019s findings of fact, but affirmed the decision of the retirement board. The Superior Court affirmed. <em>Id. </em>at 760-761. We reversed on two grounds: first, that the medical panel\u2019s answer to the third question was unsatisfactory; and second, that \u201cthe panel\u2019s reliance on \u2018risk factors\u2019 [did] not explain or justify its negative answer on causation\u201d (footnote omitted). <em>Id. </em>at 762.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">Thus, our decision in <em>Noone, </em>while reversing CRAB, essentially affirmed the findings of the administrative magistrate. Here, however, the employee\u2019s application has been rejected at every stage. There are important substantive distinctions as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">In <em>Noone, </em>the medical panel answered the third question in the negative. The certificate \u201ccalled upon the panel to state \u2018the medical basis for your conclusion.\u2019 . . . [I]n response to that instruction ... the panel answered: \u2018predisposed to coronary heart disease by multiple risk factors; myocardial infarction was not work-related.\u2019 \u201d (Footnote omitted.) <em>Id. </em>at 761. <em>The.Noone </em>medical panel also sent a letter to the retirement board in which it stated the panel had \u201ccarefully considered the multiple risk factors which he [Noone] was predisposed to coronary heart disease [szc] and. . . concluded acute myocardial infarction was not work-related. The panel. . . therefore answered unanimously no to question three.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 761-762. We characterized this response as \u201can unqualified certificate that [Noone\u2019s disability] was \u2018not work-related,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>at 761, and stated that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>\u201c[t]he panel ha[d] no statutory authority to express an unqualified negative opinion as to causation, and such an opinion, if expressed, [was] a nullity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 762, citing <em>Kelley </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>341 Mass. 611, 614-616 (1961). (In <em>Kelley, </em>\u201cthe certificate state[d] only the conclusion that there [was] no causal connection,\u201d 341 Mass. at 616, apparently without further discussion or elaboration.) We explained our conclusion in <em>Noone </em>as follows: \u201c[The retirement] board is entitled to know whether, in the opinion of the panel, there is a medical <em>possibility </em>that the causal relation exists; absent such information, the [retirement] board lacks medical information that, with nonmedical facts presented to the board, provides the basis for the decision of the [retirement] board on the question of causation\u201d (emphasis in original). <em>Noone </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>34 Mass. App. Ct. at 762. In this appeal, we conclude the employee is asking us to apply those words rather more literally than we think the court intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">Before reviewing the documents in the case before us, we note that the instructions on the certificate form Noone submitted in 1989, <em>id. </em>at 758, were different from those on the form used five years later in this case. In <em>Noone, </em>\u201cthe introduction to the form state[d] that \u2018the panel should be as expansive as possible. A cursory statement may mitigate the weight of the panel\u2019s expert opinion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 761 n.8. A \u201cnotice\u201d on the form submitted in the present case advised the panel that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-6\">\u201cIN ORDER TO ALLOW THE [RETIREMENT] BOARD TO UNDERSTAND YOUR RESPONSES TO THE QUESTIONS, YOUR NARRATIVE REPORT[S] SHOULD BE CLEAR, CONCISE AND CONSISTENT. A NARRATIVE REPORT WHICH DOES NOT FULLY SUPPORT THE CERTIFICATE RESPONSES MAY UNDERMINE THE WEIGHT OF THE MEDICAL PANEL REPORT.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">It appears that in <em>Noone, </em>the documents the medical panel submitted spoke only of risk factors. There was no discussion of the possibility that Noone\u2019s disability was the result of work-related incidents. We concluded that \u201c[a] second, and indepen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>dent, ground for the legal insufficiency of the panel\u2019s certificate [was] the fact that the panel\u2019s reliance on \u2018risk factors\u2019 [did] not explain or justify its negative answer on causation\u201d (footnote omitted). <em>Id. </em>at 762.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">We think the import of <em>Noone </em>was that as far as one could tell from the certificate, the medical panel considered only the risk factors. There was nothing in the materials forwarded to the retirement board to suggest that the panel ever considered the relationship between the nature of the disability and the employee\u2019s job, or to explain why the panel determined there was no possibility of a connection between Noone\u2019s heart ailments and his work. That is not the situation here. Both doctors considered the role the January fall may have played in the employee\u2019s disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">Dr. Gibbons reviewed the employee\u2019s history, set out his findings on physical examination, reviewed the reports submitted to the panel, and provided a lengthy paragraph of summary and conclusions in a three and one-half page letter. Gibbons stated his diagnosis that the employee has \u201csevere traumatic arthritis of both knees and also is status post multiple surgical procedures of both knees.\u201d He then gave his opinion that \u201c[i]n reference to the diagnosis as a result of the January [7], 1993 accident... he sprained his right knee and has recovered from this.\u201d After indicating his opinion that the employee was incapable of performing his job as the employee described, Gibbons expressed his further opinion that \u201c[the employee\u2019s] disability [was] the result primarily of his traumatic arthritis that predated the . . . accident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">Dr. Little\u2019s narrative also clarified his reasons for answering the third question in the negative. Little\u2019s \u201cdiagnosis\u201d made clear that he considered the accident to the employee\u2019s right knee: \u201cAlthough [the employee] struck his knee and hyper-flexed it on January 7, 1993, I do not believe that caused the progression of the degenerative changes, which are present in the right knee as well as in the left .... The contusion hyperflexion sprain [does] not appear to be responsible for his present situation, although ... his knee did not need that additional insult, I believe his present situation is [a] consequence of [a] progression of degenerative changes in both knees, which go back many years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b389-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>While the significance of Dr. Gibbons\u2019s use of the word \u201cprimarily\u201d is not entirely clear, the administrative magistrate determined that the employee had not met his burden of proof, in part because the doctors had found, by implication at least, that the accident did not aggravate the employee\u2019s condition. Upon review, CRAB concluded that the facts indicated \u201cthere was not a medical possibility of a causal relationship between [the employee\u2019s] disability and an accident or hazard undergone while in the performance of his duties.\u201d (The basis for the third doctor\u2019s opinion that the employee\u2019s disability \u201cmight be the natural and proximate result of [the January accident]\u201d was the fact that before the accident the employee had been able to work despite his \u201cvery significant pre-existent. . . condition of both knees,\u201d whereas \u201che [had] been unable to return to work since [the accident].\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">Although there is some force to the employee\u2019s claim of error, he did not carry his burden before CRAB of proving that he is entitled to an accidental disability retirement. Mindful of the deference due CRAB\u2019s interpretation and application of the statute, <em>Lisbon </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. at 257 n.10, we conclude that the certificates in this case do not suffer from the infirmity noted in <em>Noone. </em>The employee argues that the obligation of the doctors is to \u201cdetermine the absence of the possibility of causation, not the absence of causation.\u201d While there is no requirement that the doctors repeat the words of the statutory standard, use of the words might emphasize the statutory focus, viz., \u201cthe disability is not such as might be the natural and proximate cause of the accident because . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">Here the doctors answered the statutory questions as required. They also explained the reasons for their answers in the required discussion set forth in the narratives, which responded to the requests in the certificate forms. Dr. Gibbons concluded that the employee had recovered from the January, 1993, fall. Dr. Little noted that the knee injured in the fall was no more impaired than the other knee. Their responses considered the possibilities. They did not simply rely on a single statistical explanation without considering the alternatives, as was the case in <em>Noone. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>Finding no basis on which to reject CRAB\u2019s conclusions, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
