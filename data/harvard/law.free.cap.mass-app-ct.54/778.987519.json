Bruce and Michelle were dismissed from the case before trial when they reached the age of eighteen; the trial judge\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law appealed from do not concern them. Rena has now also reached eighteen, and she is not part of this appeal. All of these children, with the exception of Brace, are female, and the youngest five children, i.e., Rena, Georgette, Lucy, Beth, and Judith, are the biological children of the father involved in this appeal. All of the children were removed from their home in August, 1993, after the Department of Social Services (DSS) had received and substantiated several reports (pursuant to G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 51 A) of neglect, domestic violence, and alcohol abuse. They have resided continuously in foster care since that time. On the basis of his findings of fact and conclusions of law after a fourteen-day trial beginning in March, 1998, the trial judge determined these five children to be in need of care and protection, terminated the father\u2019s right to consent to adoption for Beth and Judith, and placed Rena, Georgette, and Lucy in the permanent custody of DSS. The father, Georgette, and Lucy have appealed. The mother of the children, who was also found unfit, has not been heard from since June, 1996, and is not part of these proceedings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b807-12\">Laurence, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A5IL\">A father appeals from a March 12, 1999, decision by a judge of the New Bedford Juvenile Court terminating his parental rights as to two of his daughters (Beth and Judith) and placing three other daughters (Rena, Georgette, and Lucy) in the permanent custody of the Department of Social Services (DSS). He alleges a variety of procedural and evidentiary grounds but chiefly challenges the ultimate finding of his unfitness as unsupported by the requisite quantum of clear and convincing evidence. Two of his children (Georgette and Lucy) appeal from a second Juvenile Court judge\u2019s denial of their March 28, 2000, motion for a new trial pursuant to Mass.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(6), 365 Mass. 828 (1974). That motion alleged that the attorney who was appointed in 1993 (after all of the children were removed from their home) to represent them and their three siblings rendered Georgette and Lucy constitutionally ineffective assistance at trial. They identify that ineffectiveness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>as the attorney\u2019s allegedly impermissible conflict of interest by virtue of his advocating for a finding of the father\u2019s parental unfitness as to all the children, while they wanted him to advocate that the two of them should remain with the father.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\">Our review of the voluminous record firmly persuades us that the appellants\u2019 several arguments are without merit; that the trial judge committed no legal error; that his findings and conclusions easily survive appellate review; and that the motion judge correctly denied the children\u2019s rule 60(b) motion. The trial judge\u2019s detailed subsidiary findings, contained in 185 separate paragraphs and subparagraphs, not only reflect the conscientiousness, high degree of care, and close attention that he was obligated to, and did, exercise in this important and difficult matter, but also are amply supported by admissible evidence. The judge\u2019s ultimate finding and conclusion flowing from the totality of the evidence \u2014 that the father is currently unfit to provide for the welfare and best interests of Beth and Judith, with no reasonable expectation of his becoming able to do so in the foreseeable future \u2014 was reached after due consideration of the relevant statutory factors and rested not merely on clear and convincing evidence but on overwhelming evidence of that unfitness. Further, the judge\u2019s ultimate finding that the father is unfit and that DSS be granted custody with respect to Rena, Georgette, and Lucy is similarly supported by clear and convincing evidence. The two children\u2019s sole appellate contention, that the motion judge erroneously denied their right to a new trial on account of the supposed ineffectiveness of their conflicted trial counsel, is unsupported either by applicable law or on this record.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the decisions appealed from, finding ourselves in substantial agreement with the trial judge\u2019s findings and conclusions and the motion judge\u2019s memorandum of decision, as well as the factual analyses, reasoning, and authorities <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>set forth in the briefs of DSS and the appellee children (Beth and Judith).</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\"><em>As to the father. </em>There is no need to rehearse the depressing chronicle of the father\u2019s shortcomings, deficits, and misdeeds reflected in the detailed findings, covering over ten years of DSS interventions and proceedings and emerging from fourteen trial days at which twenty-two witnesses (including experts) testified and sixty-nine exhibits were introduced.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">The father has challenged a mere handful of the trial judge\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>subsidiary findings as being unsupported by the record, but those challenges are unavailing, because the remaining seven score unchallenged findings provide more than sufficient basis for the judge\u2019s conclusion as to the father\u2019s unfitness.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Moreover, the few challenged findings are amply supported by other, unchallenged findings resting on admissible evidence; represent reasonable inferences drawn from evidence in the record or findings that are unchallenged; or rest upon the judge\u2019s unquestioned and unreviewable right to credit the testimony of DSS witnesses and experts rather than that which the father deems favorable to him (especially regarding his poor and unimproved parenting skills and his unshakable alcoholism problem).</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">The father\u2019s four related evidentiary complaints \u2014 that the trial judge supposedly relied on \u201cextrajudicial\u201d information, on evidence that had been stricken pursuant to motions in limine, and on \u201cstale\u201d evidence, and that the evidence did not support the findings as to the applicability to him of certain statutory factors enumerated in G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 3 \u2014 have no greater merit. His assertion that the judge improperly reviewed \u201cextrajudicial\u201d information about the case prior to the first day of trial in March, 1998 (based upon the judge\u2019s statement made on the first day of trial as to having prepared therefor by spending several hours reading various, mostly unidentified, documents relating to the case) has been waived, since he did not raise it or make any relevant objection during the trial.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">In any event, it is an ahistorical argument that fails to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>recognize that the judge had presided over matters related to the children for a period stretching back over five years. There had been investigative reports, hearings, and evidentiary submissions going back at least to August, 1993, and the judge was almost surely referring to documentary evidence that had previously been generated, presented, or admitted during the long drawn-out proceedings involving the children\u2019s care and welfare.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Additionally, it speculatively presumes that the judge\u2019s action constituted improper consideration of facts not in evidence in the case. This is fallacious, not only for the reasons stated in the preceding sentence but also because it is virtually certain (and, indeed, <em>is </em>certain as to the few identifiable documents mentioned by the judge) that, whatever the so-called \u201cextrajudicial\u201d information the father complains the judge consulted may have been, it was eventually introduced in evidence over the fourteen-day trial that followed the judge\u2019s remarks and therefore could be properly relied on.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>The father\u2019s assertion that the judge struck but then relied on certain information contained in court investigators\u2019 reports, G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 51A, reports, and a social worker\u2019s affidavit is equally baseless. Very little information was in fact stricken (a truly tiny portion of the sizeable body of evidence presented in the case); the father has failed to identify, and we cannot discern, any findings based solely on stricken material; and no serious argument has been made that the stricken information had any impact on the judge\u2019s ultimate findings and conclusions.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">The father\u2019s complaint that the evidence was too \u201cstale\u201d to support a finding of unfitness ignores the propriety of the judge\u2019s reliance on prior patterns of ongoing or repeated parental neglect, abuse, and misconduct as reliable prognosticators (particularly so when, as here, they are supported by expert opinion) in assessing a parent\u2019s present and likely future capacity and ability to care for his children. See <em>Adoption of </em>Diane, 400 Mass. 196, 204 (1987). It also evades the fact that there was evidence (much of it from testimony the judge expressly found credible) of his continued unfitness up to or near the time of trial, including the father\u2019s unabated alcohol problems, noncompliance with plans and services, and the poor and unimproved quality of his interactions with his children.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">The father\u2019s last evidentiary challenge, to the alleged lack of evidence for the judge\u2019s findings on the applicability of certain of the factors to be considered pursuant to G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 3, in dispensing with consent to adoption (chiefly concerning the extent to which the father had been offered but did not take advantage of services designed to address his parenting deficiencies), also fails. As noted earlier, those findings are either sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>ported by the record evidence or rationally inferrable from other supported findings.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\"><em>As to Georgette and Lucy. </em>Georgette \u00e1nd Lucy did not appeal the March 12, 1999, order committing them to the permanent custody of DSS. Nor did they move for a new trial within ten days of entry of the judgment thereon, pursuant to Mass.R.Civ.P. 59, 365 Mass. 827 (1974),<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> as they could have on the is<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>sue that they then knew, or should have known, they had and of which they now complain, namely misconduct of counsel in acting for an adversary during trial (which had concluded eight months prior to the entry of the judgment) in a manner prejudicial to their interests. See Smith and Zobel, Rules Practice \u00a7 59.8 (1977).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Instead, on March 28, 2000 (almost thirteen months after the judgment and twenty months after the completion of the trial), they filed (by new appellate counsel) a \u201cMotion for a New Trial Pursuant to Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 60(b)(6).\u201d That motion was supported only by the affidavit of appellate c.ounsel, which averred that Georgette and Lucy wanted and were entitled to have the care and protection orders with respect to them vacated and a new trial ordered on the issue of their father\u2019s unfitness because of ineffective representation by their trial attorney. That attorney (who had been appointed in 1993 to represent all five siblings) had, the motion charged, an \u201cactual\u201d or \u201cgenuine\u201d conflict of interest arising from his trial advocacy of the father\u2019s unfitness as to all five minor children before the court, in alleged direct opposition to Georgette and Lucy\u2019s claimed position that they wanted to be returned to their father\u2019s custody.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">On June 29, 2000, the second Juvenile Court judge, crediting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>the affidavit filed by Georgette and Lucy\u2019s trial counsel in opposition to their rule 60(b) motion, denied the motion. While indicating that the motion was probably untimely, he expressly rejected it as not involving the sort of extraordinary circumstances that such a motion is intended to address; as not presenting a meritorious claim of ineffective assistance; as subversive of the finality that children\u2019s cases require; and as productive of undue hardship and delay of the sort to be avoided in proceedings involving the State\u2019s important interest in protecting the welfare of children.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">We have no hesitation in affirming the judge\u2019s denial of Georgette\u2019s and Lucy\u2019s motion for several reasons. First and foremost, their brief ignores the applicable standard of review and the relevant authorities thereunder, and has thus failed to present an adequate argument worthy of appellate consideration in compliance with Mass.R.A.P. 16(a)(4), as amended, 367 Mass. 921 (1975). A judge\u2019s denial of a motion under Mass.R.Civ.P. 60(b) is one within his extensive discretion and is entitled to great deference by an appellate court. It will not be reversed on appeal except on a showing, by clear and convincing evidence, that the judge\u2019s broad discretion was abused to such an extent that his decision constitutes an arbitrary determination, capricious disposition, whimsical thinking, or idiosyncratic choice that no conscientious judge, acting intelligently, could honestly have reached and which effectively amounts to a miscarriage of justice. See <em>Department of Rev. </em>v. <em>C.M.J., </em>432 Mass. 69, 75-76 (2000); <em>Artco, Inc. </em>v. <em>DiFruscia, </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. 513, 517 (1977); <em>Berube </em>v. <em>McKesson Wine &amp; Spirits Co., </em>7 Mass. App. Ct. 426, 434-435 (1979); <em>Greenleaf v. Massachusetts Bay Transp. Authy., </em>22 Mass. App. Ct. 426, 429 (1986); <em>Tai </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>45 Mass. App. Ct. 220, 224 (1998); Smith &amp; Zobel, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>Rules Practice \u00a7 60.1 (1977).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Having failed to address, much less satisfy, their heavy appellate burden of demonstrating that the motion judge committed a clear abuse of discretion, Georgette\u2019s and Lucy\u2019s appeal provides no basis for disturbing the judge\u2019s ruling on their motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">That motion could also be rejected as an improper effort to obtain relief under rule 60(b)(6) that should be granted only in extraordinary circumstances, which are not presented when the allegedly aggrieved party could have reasonably sought relief by means of direct appeal.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> See <em>Pentucket Manor Chronic Hosp., Inc. </em>v. <em>Rate Setting Commn., </em>394 Mass. 233, 236 (1985); <em>Bromfield </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>400 Mass. 254, 257 (1987). \u201cTo secure relief under rule 60(b)(6) requires a showing of \u2018extraordinary\u2019 circumstances. ... If cases are to have finality, the operation of rule 60(b) must receive \u2018extremely meagre scope.\u2019 . . . \u2018Rule 60 is to litigation what mouth-to-mouth resuscitation is to first aid: a life-saving treatment, applicable in desperate cases.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bowers </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Marshfield, </em>16 Mass. App. Ct. 29, 33 &amp; n.5 (1983), quoting from Smith &amp; Zobel, Rules Practice \u00a7 60.1 (1977). Compare <em>Adoption of Whitney, </em>53 Mass. App. Ct. 832, 837 (2002). Achieving finality and minimizing delay and uncertainty are appropriate considerations when acting on any rule 60(b) motion (see <em>Chiu-Kun Woo </em>v. <em>Moy, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 949, 950 [1983]; <em>Tibbits </em>v. <em>Wisiniewski, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 729, 732 [1989]); they are prime considerations (as the motion judge properly recognized here) when the rights, interests, and welfare of children in custody and adoption proceedings are involved. See <em>Custody &amp; Adop</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number><em>tion of Ned, </em>28 Mass. App. Ct. 557, 560 (1990); <em>Adoption of Hugh, </em>35 Mass. App. Ct. 346, 353-354 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">Further, the motion judge expressly concluded that Georgette\u2019s and Lucy\u2019s trial counsel had in fact provided effective assistance to them in making the court aware of their expressed wish to be returned to their father while nonetheless advocating that they not be returned to the custody of the violent, abusive, alcoholic and resistant father. The judge also determined that such representation had been in Georgette\u2019s and Lucy\u2019s best interests and not in conflict with counsel\u2019s obligations to them or to the five siblings as a whole. Georgette\u2019s and Lucy\u2019s brief fails to challenge (except inferentially) any of these findings and conclusions ,as being clearly or legally erroneous or abuses of discretion on this record, and they are, accordingly, entitled to deference on appeal. See <em>Berube </em>v. <em>McKesson Wine &amp; Spirits Co., </em>7 Mass. App. Ct. at 434. Cf. <em>Guerin </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>339 Mass. 731, 734-735 (1959); <em>Fogarty </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>406 Mass. 103, 107-111 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">Finally, the motion judge confronted and resolved without abuse of discretion the relevant factors to be considered when ruling on a motion under rule 60(b)(6): whether the circumstances were so extraordinary as to warrant relief; whether the moving party presented a \u201cmeritorious\u201d contention; and whether the \u201csubstantial rights\u201d of other parties would be adversely affected by granting the motion. See <em>Parrell </em>v. <em>Keenan, </em>389 Mass. 809, 815 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b817-7\">Several circumstances buttress the judge\u2019s determination that Georgette\u2019s and Lucy\u2019s situation does not involve extraordinary circumstances: their failure to have raised their now-claimed grievance over the several years of their representation by the challenged counsel, particularly during trial or for many months thereafter, despite frequent opportunities to do so (including at in-chambers meetings with the judge and by direct appeal); the conspicuous absence of affidavits or other evidence submitted in support of the motion reflecting the actual, current attitudes and intentions of Georgette and Lucy themselves; the overwhelming evidence in the record documenting the unfitness of the father to be awarded custody of Georgette and Lucy; and their semiannual (as yet forgone) opportunities since the judgment and over <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>the next several years, at review and redetermination hearings pursuant to G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 26, to be heard on the issues of custody and their current needs, with the assistance of counsel presumably unaffected by disabling conflict.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">The judge\u2019s evaluation of the appellants\u2019 claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, based upon trial counsel\u2019s supposedly inherent and per se reversible conflict of interest, as not sufficiently meritorious was also sound. It is noteworthy that the appellants proffer not a single authoritative decision upholding their argument, which appears at odds with the Supreme Judici\u00e1l Court\u2019s pronouncements in <em>Adoption of Erica, </em>426 Mass. 55 (1997) (cited and relied on by the judge).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> It appears, as well, unsupported by the only relevant ethical opinion, Massachusetts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>Bar Association (MBA) Committee on Professional Ethics, Opinion No. 93-6 (1993)<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> (dealing with an attorney representing a thirteen year old child in a care and protection proceeding in which the minor client instructed the lawyer to advocate for her return to her mother, which the lawyer deemed contrary to her best interest because of the mother\u2019s unfitness).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b820-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>We do not, however, have to decide the novel and difficult issue whether trial counsel\u2019s performance in the particular circumstances fell measurably below that which may be expected from an ordinary fallible lawyer, as contended in Georgette\u2019s and Lucy\u2019s brief, in order to uphold the judge\u2019s denial of their motion. As the judge correctly held, even were that performance deemed subpar, Georgette and Lucy failed to establish the second prong of the governing test from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Saferian, 366 Mass. 89, 96-98:<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> that they were thereby deprived of an available, substantial argument or theory the presentation of which would have accomplished something material for them or would likely have made a difference in the outcome. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Satterfield, 373 Mass. 109, 115 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>&amp; n.10 (1977); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>398 Mass. 838, 839 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">The trial judge was well aware of Georgette\u2019s and Lucy\u2019s stated (if intermittent) desires regarding their father (through testimony, presentations by their now-maligned trial counsel, and lobby conferences). Given the overwhelming evidence of the father\u2019s unfitness (as well as the clear and convincing evidence of the two girls\u2019 special problems and needs in substantial consequence thereof), which persuaded both the trial judge and the motion judge that it was not in Georgette\u2019s and Lucy\u2019s best interests to be returned to his care, it is implausible that the most zealous and impassioned arguments by any trial counsel to give their custody to the alcoholic and unrepentant father who had neglected and had physically or sexually abused them would have realistically accomplished any change in the result. <em>See Adoption of Holly, </em>432 Mass. 680, 690 (2000) (\u201c[the father\u2019s] parental unfitness was established by overwhelming evidence. [His] claim that further efforts by his trial counsel [charged by the father with ineffective assistance] could have produced a different result has no basis in the record\u201d).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">Lastly, we see no error in the judge\u2019s observation that grant<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>ing the relief sought in Georgette\u2019s and Lucy\u2019s motion for a new trial \u2014 wholly aside from its nonextraordinary and non-meritorious nature \u2014 \u201cwould vastly affect the substantial rights of the parties and would also have a detrimental effect on\u201d their siblings. As the judge aptly observed, \u201c[jjudgments should not be reopened on the issue of custody and adoption . . . when \u2018[a]ny significant delay would undermine the state\u2019s important interest in protecting the welfare of children,\u2019 \u201d particularly after the appellants have had a full opportunity to present their evidence on the merits of the case (quoting from <em>Adoption of Hugh, </em>35 Mass. App. Ct. at 353). Relitigation of evidence accumulated over seven or more years \u2014 inevitably revisiting the issue of the father\u2019s parental fitness \u2014 and reassembling the numerous witnesses (who may be unavailable or have faded memories) would, at the very least, undermine the basic policy objective of \u201c[sjpeedy resolution of cases involving issues of custody or adoption,\u201d <em>Adoption of Emily, </em>25 Mass. App. Ct. 579, 581 (1988), as well as the equally important goal of finality in such cases. Cf. <em>Adoption of Erica, </em>426 Mass. at 64-65 (\u201cWe have noted our concern about the high cost to litigants and to the court system occasioned by motions to disqualify attorneys [for alleged conflict of interest] especially when such motions are used as harassment and dilatory tactics. . . . [They are] especially troublesome in a case that involves the resolution of a child\u2019s future family life. . . . [Here, the child\u2019s] status has been indeterminate for the past seven and one-half years\u201d). The motion judge cannot be faulted for balancing the speculative consequences of the alleged ineffective assistance of counsel for Georgette\u2019s and Lucy\u2019s rights against the adverse effects that reopening the case would have on the substantial rights and interests of all the siblings and resolving the issue in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>favor of finality.

His protest that he was denied his supposed constitutional right of confrontation at trial (because of his positioning so as to be out of the line of vision of one of the daughters while she testified about his sexual abuse of her) has no merit in light of <em>Adoption of Don, </em>435 Mass. 158, 167-169 (2001). His claim of abuse of discretion by the Juvenile Court judge who denied his posttrial motion to vacate the order of the trial judge (who had retired) as to the father\u2019s unfitness, dismiss all of DSS\u2019s petitions, and grant full custody to him, is entirely conclusory and unsupported by citation to relevant authority (contrary to Mass.R.A.P. 16[a][4]), as well as futilely reliant on \u201call of the reasons\u201d set forth in his brief against the finding of his parental unfitness \u2014 none of which has any substance, as discussed above. Finally, his attack on the trial judge\u2019s vacating of the previous visitation orders and leaving the issue to DSS\u2019s discretion is erroneously based upon a misreading of the distinguishable cited cases <em>(Adoption of Vito, </em>431 Mass. 550 [2000]; <em>Adoption of Greta, 431 </em>Mass. 577 [2000]) and of DSS\u2019s authority under G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 21, vis-a-vis children committed to its custody (\u201c \u2018custody\u2019 shall include the . . . power[]... to control visits to the child\u201d). The father\u2019s position also fails to acknowledge that such matters are left to the sound discretion of the trial judge (see <em>Adoption of Nicole, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 259, 264 [1996]); that in ordering posttrial visitation, the proper focus is on the best interests of the child and on parental unfitness, rather than the rights of the parent (see <em>Adoption of Mary, </em>414 Mass. 705, 712 [1993]; <em>Adoption of Helen, </em>429 Mass. 856, 863 [1999]); and that the judge made extensive findings as to the consistently unsatisfactory nature of the father\u2019s visitation record, often stimulating inappropriate behavior or upset on the part of the children. From those findings alone, the judge could rationally conclude that visitation so potentially productive of harmful impact upon the children should be subject to the regulation by DSS. Cf. G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 31A, which requires the judge, in considering the issue of visitation by a non-custodial parent found to be abusive, to \u201cprovide[] for the safety and well-being of the child\u201d and authorizes the court to \u201cimpos[e] any . . . condition that is deemed necessary\u201d for such safety and well-being. In connection with the father\u2019s professed dissatisfaction with the judge\u2019s visitation order, we note that he has had five opportunities to press for redetermination thereof since the judge\u2019s March 12, 1999, decision as to the children in the department\u2019s custody, pursuant to G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 26, but he has taken advantage of none of them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b813-7\">Although the Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure have not been expressly made applicable to Juvenile Court proceedings, they are accepted \u201cas a cogent standard\u201d in children\u2019s cases there. <em>Care and Protection of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number><em>Zelda, </em>26 Mass.

As the judge found, Georgette \u2014 a deeply troubled youth described by her therapist as very immature for her age (thirteen at the time of trial), with little insight, who had been held back three times in school, who had been physically abused at the hands of her father and refused to visit him at times \u2014 expressed a desire to return to her father\u2019s care while simultaneously saying that she would not mind staying in her current foster placement. Lucy (who was eleven years old at trial and who may or may not remain associated with Georgette\u2019s appellate arguments [see note 3, <em>supra]) </em>suffered from her father\u2019s neglect, was sexually abused by him, testified to that sexual abuse at trial, and has elevated levels of lead amounting to lead poisoning in her system, yet expressed a wish to return to live with her father. Given this background of vacillation and questionable maturity on the part of Georgette and Lucy, we find it troubling that the stated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>basis for their novel \u201cconflict of interest\u201d contention \u2014 the conclusory assertion that Georgette and Lucy were fully competent to make informed judgments for themselves as to their own interests and to instruct their attorney to advocate for their reunification with their father \u25a0 \u2014 \u25a0 was not supported by contemporaneous affidavits from them as part of their rule 60(b)(6) motion expressly declaring their continued desire to return to their father\u2019s custody thirteen months after the judgment. We also observe that the supposed existence of such a desire appears inconsistent with their failure to have pressed their rights to have biannual review and redetermination of their current needs. The premise that Georgette and Lucy were fully competent at trial to gouge their own interests, express them, and instruct their attorney to advance them also does not square with the fact that the record reveals that Georgette and Lucy were apparently not autonomous or self-aware enough to have ever actually objected to what their appellate counsel now condemns as blatantly disloyal conduct on the part of their trial attorney, despite continuing and unobstructed opportunities to do so for years before and during the fourteen days of trial, including at lobby conferences with the judge, or for over a year thereafter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b820-5\">Claims of ineffective assistance of counsel in care and protection and adoption proceedings are measured by the standards set forth in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, </em>366 Mass. 89, 96-97 (1974), the first prong of which is as just stated above.

Accordingly, in that motion they made no claim that the attorney had done or failed to do anything else that prejudiced their case. See note 12, <em>supra. </em>In their appellate brief, they apparently felt the need to hedge their bet by arguing for the first time that their trial attorney had indeed caused them special prejudice: by putting Lucy on the stand to testify as to the father\u2019s having sexually abused her; by not objecting to and then not moving to strike Michelle\u2019s testimony concerning her prolonged sexual abuse by the father; and by cross-examining other witnesses to elicit evidence of the father\u2019s unfitness. Having failed to present these contentions to the motion judge, they have no right to expect us to take them into consideration in reviewing the correctness of his ruling. See <em>Royal Indem.
