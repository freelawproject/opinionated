L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32E(\u00a3&gt;)(3). On appeal he argues that (1) the judge improperly denied his motion for a required finding of not guilty; and (2) improper remarks in the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. We agree with the defendant regarding his first claim, and thus, it is unnecessary to review the defendant\u2019s second claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-16\">1. <em>Background. </em>On May 5, 1998, the Worcester police executed a search warrant for the third-floor, three-bedroom apartment located at 17 Cheever Street. Upon entry, the police secured seven individuals, including the defendant, who were in the apartment. The defendant, who had been in the kitchen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>speaking on the telephone, made no attempt to flee and had to be asked to hang up the telephone. Nine hundred and fifty-one dollars in cash was found on his person and seized.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">In one bedroom, the police found one piece of crack cocaine on the bed, one plastic baggie, and two more pieces of crack cocaine on a plate with a razor blade. In a second bedroom, the police discovered a smoldering crack pipe, one piece of crack cocaine on a plate, two razor blades, and cut-cornered baggies. In a third bedroom, the police found two razor blades on the windowsill, a scale, and some paperwork with notations indicating drug sales and transactions. Male clothing, a decorative heart-shaped wreath,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> a cup with the defendant\u2019s picture on it, a key to the apartment, a cellular telephone and paperwork affiliated with both \u201cHenry James\u201d and \u201cRoy Weston,\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> including an automobile repair invoice in the name of \u201cRoy Weston, 17 Cheever Street, Worcester, Mass.,\u201d were located in the third bedroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">The living room and kitchen were sparsely appointed. The police discovered a pile of tools and a \u201cRay\u2019s Roofing, Call Us, Free Estimates\u201d refrigerator magnet in the kitchen, as well as \u201cRay\u2019s Roofing Company\u201d fliers throughout the apartment. A heat sealer, two boxes of sandwich bags, two bags filled with \u201csmall blue Ziplock baggies,\u201d a surgical mask, and paperwork indicating numbers \u201cconsistent with the sale and records kept in the sale of crack cocaine\u201d were found in the pantry. Cut-cornered baggies lay in the trash on the third-floor porch. The police found a plastic margarine container with off-white residue<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and one two-ounce bottle of inositol in the bathroom.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">The \u201ctriple decker\u201d house sat in a congested neighborhood of similar homes and had a separate apartment on each floor. Each apartment had a back porch, connected by a common stairway to the yard at ground level, without a gate or other impediments to common passage. A shed, described as a \u201ccom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>mon structural feature of a three decker in the City of Worcester,\u201d appeared on each back porch. Each shed could be accessed from the porch, but not directly from the apartment units. The shed on the third floor porch was the only access point in the entire building that \u201ceventually led to the attic,\u201d but again, the shed could not be accessed through the interior of the third-floor apartment. The shed was secured by a combination padlock that police pried off during their search.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">Inside the shed, the police observed no tools or appliances and commented that there \u201cmay have been some boxes . . . but nothing significant.\u201d After making this determination, the police observed \u201ca cutout, kind of an entrance square that they used to get into the attic. Anybody, I mean landlords, anybody [could use] it to get in to do repair work.\u201d This square \u201ccutout\u201d in the ceiling of the shed was the only access route to the attic and was \u201cabout maybe eight and a half, ten feet off the ground.\u201d Finding no ladder, the police officer \u201cclimbed up the side of the wall. Stepping between the boards and grabbing on . . . ,\u201d the officer pulled himself up and through the \u201ccutout\u201d to get into the attic.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">Once inside the attic, the police discovered a flashlight, a sifter,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> razor blades, four bottles of rubbing alcohol, and a bag within a bag with an outer plastic wrapper (bags) containing 102.17 grams of powder cocaine.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Fingerprints were found on the bottles of rubbing alcohol, but they did not match with any of the seven detained suspects, including the defendant. It appears that the bags were also examined for fingerprints; a witness testified that \u201cif they found prints on [the bags, the prints] didn\u2019t match up with anybody.\u201d On cross-examination the same witness testified that \u201c[t]here were fingerprints found, none connected to the individuals in this room.\u201d There was no evidence suggesting that the bags were similar to or matched the baggies found in the third-floor apartment. Moreover, police found in the attic no evidence, such as \u201cpersonal items, paperwork, or anything,\u201d that was connected to the defendant or the other detained suspects.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>2. <em>Required finding of not guilty. </em>The defendant contends that the trial judge improperly denied his motion for a required finding of not guilty because there was insufficient evidence that he constructively possessed the powder cocaine found in the attic. When reviewing the denial of a motion for a required finding of not guilty, \u201c[w]e consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth to determine whether any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sinforoso, </em>434 Mass. 320, 326 (2001), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cordle, </em>412 Mass. 172, 175 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">\u201cTo sustain a conviction of trafficking in cocaine under G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32E, the Commonwealth must show that the defendant had \u2018possession\u2019 of the cocaine.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sinforoso, supra </em>at 327. Absent evidence of actual possession, the Commonwealth must prove that the defendant had constructive possession. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 235, 237 (1997). Constructive possession requires proof that the defendant knew of the location of the illegal drugs and had the ability and intent to exert dominion and control over them. <em>Ibid. </em>\u201cThe requisite proof of possession \u2018may be established by circumstantial evidence, and the inferences that can be drawn therefrom.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid., </em>quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LaPerle, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 424, 426 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">In this case the defendant conceded that there was sufficient evidence of his connection to the apartment where he was arrested. At oral argument the defendant conceded that the evidence was sufficient to prove that he was \u201cinvolved in the sale of crack cocaine,\u201d and that the apartment was, essentially, a \u201ccrack house.\u201d He argues however, that there was insufficient evidence that he was aware of the powder cocaine in the attic and had the ability and intent to exercise dominion and control over it. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-7\">Here, the attic was only accessible through the locked shed on the third-floor porch of a three-level, three-family apartment house. Nothing in the attic reasonably connected the defendant to the attic or the powder cocaine. Police found no fingerprints that matched any of the suspects. No direct evidence connected the defendant or his confederates to the combination lock, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>no fingerprints were taken from it. There was no demonstrable showing that the crack cocaine found in the apartment was derivative of the powder cocaine found in the attic, nor did the Commonwealth present any evidence to show similarities between the attic bags and the baggies found throughout the apartment. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Movilis, </em>46 Mass. App. Ct. 574, 577 (1999) (no evidence of any similarities in either quality or packaging between cocaine seized in car and substance seized from table in caf\u00e9). Nothing in the record indicated that the powder cocaine in the attic contained inositol, nor was there any evidence of any baking soda in the attic or third-floor apartment.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Furthermore, no one testified that the defendant conducted himself in a suspicious manner relative to the attic or did anything to indicate consciousness of guilt concerning the premises. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Movilis, supra </em>at 576. Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sinforoso, supra </em>at 328 (defendant appeared nervous and was sweating during encounter); <em>Alicea </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>410 Mass. 384, 387-388 (1991) (defendant\u2019s demeanor could support inference that he knew drugs were present); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Velasquez, </em>48 Mass. App. Ct. 147, 150 (1999) (defendant did not disassociate himself from arrest and stated that he would be going to jail for two years). The Commonwealth presented no evidence concerning the occupants of the first and second floor units, the physical characteristics of those units, the general characteristics of the neighborhood, or the building owner. Further, there was no evidence from the building owner regarding access to the attic by the defendant or others.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Booker, </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. 435, 438 (1991), we concluded that the Commonwealth had failed to meet its burden of proof on the question of possession where evidence was admitted to show that the defendant resided in an apairtment where drugs were recovered, but that the contraband was found in a common area to which the defendant had no special connection, and certainly no right of control. Here, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>record is likewise devoid of sufficient evidence connecting the defendant to the common \u2014 even public \u2014 area in which the powder cocaine was discovered.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">Similarly in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>51 Mass. App. Ct. 598, 604 (2001), we determined that possession of ammunition found in the basement of the defendant\u2019s apartment building could not be imputed to the defendant absent some evidence specifically linking him to the basement. As we stated in that case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-6\">\u201cThe Commonwealth introduced nothing indicating that Hill had at any time been present in the cellar or was aware of its contents. Neither did the Commonwealth claim to have found in the cellar any items identifiably belonging to or associated with [the defendant], such as personal papers or effects . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b759-7\">Precisely the same void existed in the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence here. As in <em>Hill </em>and <em>Booker, </em>the evidence of possession was insufficient as matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-8\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b759-9\">\n<em>Verdict set aside.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b759-10\">\n<em>Judgment for the defendant.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b755-8\">This wreath was hanging above the bed in the third bedroom and carried the legend: \u201cI (picture of heart) you Roy.\u201d See note 2, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b755-9\">The defendant is also known as Roy Weston.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b755-10\">The residue in the margarine bowl was never analyzed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b755-11\">testimony at trial brought forth that inositol could be used as a cutting agent to dilute cocaine and that it is sold over the counter at health food stores as a dietary supplement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b756-7\">On the sifter was a white film that was never analyzed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b756-8\">No evidence was presented that indicated that the cocaine found in the attic was diluted with inositol.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b758-6\"><em>A </em>police officer testified that baking soda is needed to convert powder cocaine into rock cocaine. \u201c[The cocaine] also could be cooked up into crack cocaine in which it would be boiled using baking soda.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b759-11\"><em>As </em>noted above, a police witness testified that the attic was a place where landlords, anybody . . .
