The issue presented is the legal effect of the defendant O\u2019Neil\u2019s stopping his van and signaling the teenage pedestrian, the plaintiff Amy Woods, to proceed, as she stood on the double yellow line of a four lane road. She was thereafter struck by an automobile driven by Jeffrey Felix. The plaintiffs also appeal from the denial of various motions they filed to ensure that Felix, who settled, be included as a defendant for the purpose of allocating percentage shares of negligence under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 85. We reverse the summary judgment and remand the case to the Superior Court for trial. We affirm the orders of a second Superior Court judge denying the plaintiffs\u2019 motions and decline to rule on the status of the settling joint tortfeasor pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 85, as the question is premature.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">1. <em>Facts. </em>\u201cThe standard of review of a grant of summary judgment is whether, viewing , the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, all material facts have been established and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Mooney, </em>431 Mass. 57, 60 (2000). The facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff are as follows. On February 6, 1996, Amy Woods (Woods), age fourteen, was struck at rush hour by a car driven by the defendant Felix, while she and Colleen Fettes attempted to cross Page Boulevard from south to north. Page Boulevard is a four-lane road in Springfield with two travel lanes eastbound and two travel lanes westbound separated by a double yellow line. O\u2019Neil was driving a NYNEX van westbound in the left lane on Page Boulevard when he saw the two girls cross the eastbound lanes and approach the center lines. O\u2019Neil slowed the van and came to a complete stop. The van blocked the girls\u2019 view of oncoming westbound traffic.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">O\u2019Neil then waved the girls to cross, with a sweeping left to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>right motion with his left hand.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Woods ran across the front of the NYNEX van and, without looking further, crossed directly into the right lane of westbound traffic where Felix\u2019s automobile struck her. At the time, Fettes, who was not hit, was a couple of steps behind Woods.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">2. <em>Discussion of negligence. </em>The plaintiffs argued that O\u2019Neil in the course of his employment with NYNEX (1) negligently stopped his van when he saw the plaintiff standing on the double yellow line thereby blocking her view of traffic in the northernmost lane and (2) negligently signaled her to proceed. The judge determined that O\u2019Neil was not negligent in stopping as he was required to slow his vehicle and yield pursuant to the seventh sentence of G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 14.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As to the plaintiffs\u2019 theory of negligent signaling by O\u2019Neil, the judge, \u201cassuming such a cause of action to be viable in the Commonwealth,\u201d ruled that the plaintiffs had no reasonable expectation of satisfying their burden of proof on the element of proximate causation. Proximate cause, he reasoned, could only be shown by evidence that Woods relied on O\u2019Neil\u2019s hand signal when she crossed in front of his van and into the next lane of traffic where she was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>struck by Felix. He concluded that summary judgment was appropriate, as the plaintiffs had submitted no testimonial evidence to show that Woods saw or relied on O\u2019Neil\u2019s signal, and were unlikely to be able to do so at trial. Woods cannot testify herself due to the severity of her injuries from the accident. Fettes testified at her deposition that she was not looking at the driver and would not have been able to see a signal in any event, as she was not wearing her glasses.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">We conclude that the stopping and signaling are too interrelated in the instant case to be analyzed separately. Rather than break O\u2019Neil\u2019s response into pieces, we consider his conduct as a whole when he was confronted by the two girls standing on the double yellow lines of the four-lane road on which he was driving.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">At issue is whether the defendants can demonstrate that the plaintiffs do not have a reasonable expectation of establishing two elements of their tort claim: breach of a duty and causation. <em>Kourouvacilis </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., </em>410 Mass 706, 716 (1991) (\u201c[A] party moving for summary judgment in a case in which the opposing party will have the burden of proof at trial is entitled to summary judgment if he demonstrates, by reference to material described in [Mass.R.Civ.P. 56(c), 365 Mass. 822 (1974)], unmet by countervailing materials, that the party opposing the motion has no reasonable expectation of proving an essential element of that party\u2019s case\u201d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The defendants argue that, even if there were a signal, the only reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>inference that could be drawn from it is that O\u2019Neil intended the girls to cross in front of the NYNEX van, and not into the next lane, and, therefore, even by signaling, he was not in breach of a duty, as matter of law. The defendants contend, as the motion judge found, that in the absence of direct evidence that Woods saw O\u2019Neil\u2019s signal and relied on it, the plaintiffs have no reasonable expectation of establishing causation. For the reasons discussed below, we conclude that there are genuine issues of material fact for the jury on both breach of a duty and causation, and the defendant is not entitled to judgment as matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">a. <em>Breach of duty. </em>In the few signaling cases that have been decided by the Massachusetts appellate courts, the courts have left for the jury the interpretation of a hand signal, the reasonable inferences that could be drawn from it, and the determination of the over-all questions of negligence and contributory negligence. For example, in <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Authy., 3 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 726 (1975), there was evidence that an operator of a streetcar \u201csounded a bell warning and made a hand signal for the plaintiff to cross in front of the streetcar\u201d which then struck him. <em>Ibid. </em>Without elaboration, this court concluded it was \u201cfor the jury to determine the negligence of either or both of the actors.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Most of the signaling cases, however, predate the comparative negligence statute, made effective in 1971, and address the issue of reasonable care by the plaintiff, and not the defendant\u2019s negligence. See <em>O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>Lexington &amp; Boston St. Ry., </em>205 Mass. 182 (1910); <em>Cuddy </em>v. <em>Boston Elev. Ry., </em>208 Mass. 134 (1911); <em>Hennessey </em>v. <em>Boston </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number><em>Elev. Ry., </em>211 Mass. 524, 525 (1912); <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Me. R.R., </em>242 Mass. 188 (1922). More importantly, none has addressed a signaling accident in which a third party struck the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-4\">Courts in a number of other jurisdictions have held that a driver\u2019s signaling creates a jury question concerning negligence where a third party injures the plaintiff.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Other courts have upheld the allowance of motions for summary judgment or directed verdict. They have done so by (1) concluding that a motorist\u2019s hand signal can be interpreted to do no more than yield the right of way, at least where the signaling driver is not in a position to determine whether it is safe for the plaintiff to proceed into the next lane, or (2) determining that the person signaled had a nondelegable duty to look for oncoming traffic.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Most, if not all, of the cases allowing summary judgment in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>these third party signaling cases involved injuries to adults, not children.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">We conclude that in the circumstances of this case, O\u2019Neil\u2019s signaling presents a jury question regarding O\u2019Neil\u2019s negligence. We cannot rule as matter of law that his signal to the girls could only be interpreted as allowing them to pass in front of his van or that his duty to the girls extended no further than the front of his van. Although a more difficult question would have been raised if the girls were adults, \u201c[t]he law . . . makes allowances for the impulsiveness and lack of maturity and experience of children.\u201d <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Knight, 362 </em>Mass. 350, 352 (1972).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> As the Michigan Supreme Court stated in a case presenting similar facts, the court should not determine, \u201cas a matter of law, the intended meaning of [the] waving action and, more important, the thought that it might reasonably have been anticipated would be conveyed thereby to the 10-year-old girl.\u201d <em>Sweet </em>v. <em>Ringwelski, 362 </em>Mich. 138, 144 (1961).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">In sum, the defendants have not demonstrated that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>plaintiffs have \u201cno reasonable expectation of proving [breach of duty,] an essential element\u201d of their case, given the following facts and the reasonable inferences that could be drawn from them: (1) the age of Woods, (2) the truck\u2019s stopping and blocking of her view of westbound traffic, (3) the rush hour conditions, (4) the signaling as described by Spano, and (5) Woods\u2019s immediate crossing after the signal both in front of the van and into the next lane.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">b. <em>Causation. </em>The defendants argue nonetheless that the plaintiffs cannot establish that O\u2019Neil\u2019s signaling was the proximate cause of Woods\u2019s injuries. Neither Fettes, nor Spano, nor any other witness saw Woods look at O\u2019Neil while he signaled. The plaintiffs\u2019 inability to show Woods\u2019s reliance, the defendants claim, means that the plaintiffs cannot show that any act or failure to act by the defendants caused her injuries. Woods caused her own injuries, according to the defendants, when, without looking, she ran into the path of an oncoming car.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">The defendants\u2019 assertion discounts entirely the deposition testimony of Spano, who testified that O\u2019Neil signaled the girls to cross the road, and that Woods thereafter ran without looking in front of the NYNEX van and into the right lane of traffic. The defendants\u2019 insistence that Woods\u2019s reliance on O\u2019Neil cannot be shown is also undermined by certain uncontested facts of the accident. According to all witnesses (including O\u2019Neil), Woods and Fettes stopped on the double yellow line dividing the four lanes of Page Boulevard before proceeding across the second two lanes of traffic. There, they waited for two cars to go past before O\u2019Neil stopped the NYNEX van and signaled. Woods\u2019s actions support a \u201crational inference of probabilities from established facts\u201d that Woods relied on a signal from O\u2019Neil before deciding to cross the remaining lanes of Page Boulevard. <em>Zezuski </em>v. <em>Jenny Mfg. Co., </em>363 Mass. 324, 329 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>3. <em>Settling tortfeasor. </em>The plaintiffs twice sought, via motions pursuant to Mass.R.Civ.P. 54(b), 365 Mass. 820 (1974), to stay the proceedings against Felix, whose settlement had not yet been formalized by a judgment, while entering a final judgment for NYNEX and O\u2019Neil. These various motions were all apparently directed at the issue of retaining a settling tortfeasor in the case for the purpose of allocating percentages of negligence pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 85.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The first motion was denied, on the ground that staggered appeals are strongly disfavored. The plaintiffs moved for reconsideration, arguing, without elaboration, that (1) \u201cFelix is only being kept in the case for purpose of our joint tortfeasor law\u201d and (2) there would not be two appeals as Felix had settled. The judge again denied the motion, ruling that allowing one defendant to remain in the case \u201cwhile all other parties pursue an appeal . . . [is] disfavored.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">The plaintiffs then moved for approval of a form of agreement for judgment. Included in their proposed judgment was language providing: \u201cshould the plaintiffs\u2019 claims . . . reach trial, the jury is to be instructed that defendant Felix\u2019s negligence must be considered in any determination of the comparative negligence of Amy Woods; i.e., Amy Woods\u2019 negligence, if any, is to be. \u2018compared to the total negligence of all persons against whom recovery is sought,\u2019 including defendant Felix.\u201d This form of judgment was denied, and an agreement for judgment without conditions against Felix was finally executed.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">The judge was within her discretion in denying the rule 54(b) motion for the reasons stated. See <em>Long </em>v. <em>Wickett, </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. 380, 388 (2000). We also agree with the defendants that the plaintiffs cannot dictate which instructions a judge will give before a trial has even occurred, and that the judge\u2019s order denying the motion seeking approval of the form of judgment was therefore within her discretion. The plaintiffs would have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>us nonetheless reach the undecided substantive issue underlying their request to the judge.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Such consideration by this court would be premature. As summary judgment has been reversed, the plaintiffs are not foreclosed from directly presenting the issue to the trial judge for consideration on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">4. <em>Conclusion. </em>The judgment in favor of defendants O\u2019Neil and NYNEX is reversed. The orders denying the plaintiffs\u2019 (1) motion for entry of final judgment pursuant to rule 54(b) and for stay of proceedings, (2) the related motion for rehearing, and (3) motion for approval of form of agreement for judgment are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b798-6\">We view this disputed fact in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, relying, as did the trial judge, on the deposition testimony of William Spano, who testified that he observed, through the back window of the NYNEX van, a silhouette in the NYNEX van waving to the girls as described above. Disregarding the summary judgment standard of review, the defendants discount or eliminate Spano\u2019s testimony. They rely instead on the deposition testimony of O\u2019Neil who denies waving and claims that he threw his hands up in the air as a reflex reaction and yelled \u201cno.\u201d They also emphasize the results of an investigation performed by an accident reconstruction expert that they retained which suggest that Spano could not have seen the hand signal due to his obstructed view of the driver\u2019s seat of the NYNEX van. O\u2019Neil\u2019s supplemental response to Woods\u2019s interrogatories discloses, however, that the accident reconstruction expert found that eighty-four percent of Spano\u2019s view was obstructed, not that it was entirely impossible for Spano to see O\u2019Neil, as the defendants appear to claim in their brief. Spano\u2019s deposition testimony, considered in the most favorable light, is more than sufficient to throw into dispute the material fact whether O\u2019Neil signaled to the girls. The defendants have not shown that it was impossible for Spano to have seen a hand signal by O\u2019Neil to the girls. Rather, they have raised questions concerning his credibility. The defendant\u2019s legal arguments, to the extent that they are based on the nonexistence of a signal, are therefore rejected.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b798-7\">\u201cUpon approaching a pedestrian who is upon the traveled part of any way and not upon a sidewalk, every person operating a motor vehicle shall slow down.\u201d G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 14.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b799-7\">The other two elements of the plaintiffs\u2019 negligence claim, duty and injury, do not require extensive analysis. The injury to Woods is obvious and uncontested. The duty, albeit the source of some discussion in the briefs, particularly in regard to its origin, is to exercise a reasonable degree of care as an operator of the motor vehicle to avoid injury to pedestrians. See generally <em>Buckman </em>v. <em>McCarthy Freight Sys., Inc., </em>320 Mass. 551, 554 (1947) (operator of tractor trailer truck had duty to exercise reasonable degree of care for pedestrian). See also <em>Trombley </em>v. <em>Stevens-Duryea Co., </em>206 Mass. 516, 518 (1910) (\u201cThe statute [predecessor to G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 14], while elaborately providing for what shall be done under certain contingencies, does not relieve those in charge or control of the automobile . . . from taking such further precautions as the dictates of ordinary prudence may demand\u201d); <em>Avery </em>v. <em>R.E.

As an alternative source of duty, the plaintiffs contend that O\u2019Neil\u2019s signaling constituted a \u201cvoluntary assumption of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>duty\u201d regarding the girls. See <em>Mullins </em>v. <em>Pine Manor College, </em>389 Mass. 47, 53 (1983); <em>Cottam </em>v. <em>CVS Pharmacy, </em>436 Mass. 316, 323-324 (2002).

As the two contested issues in the instant case \u2014 whether the signaling constituted a failure to exercise reasonable care under the circumstances, and whether there was reliance on the signaling \u2014 require the same analysis regardless of the origin of the duty, we do not analyze the \u201cvoluntary assumption of duty\u201d argument separately.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b801-5\">See, e.g., <em>Frey </em>v.
