G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 15A. The victim was Olga Pierowski, the defendant\u2019s wife. The sole issue on appeal is whether Officer Daniel Fitzpatrick should have been permitted to testify, over objection, to a \u201cstatement\u201d made by Olga under the rubric of \u201cspontaneous utterance,\u201d an exception to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>the rule against hearsay evidence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After voir dire, the judge allowed, without comment, the Commonwealth\u2019s motion in limine to admit Olga\u2019s nod of the head as a statement. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\">During voir dire, Fitzpatrick testified to the following. On February 19, 1999, at approximately 7:00 p.m., he and other officers were dispatched to a second floor apartment at 22 Smith Street in Lawrence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> When he arrived he observed blood splattered on the floor and on a table in the kitchen. Other than the police officers, Olga and the defendant were the only persons present in the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">Fitzpatrick testified that Olga was \u201cvisibly upset.\u201d She was speaking Polish and would not stand still. He noticed blood on her leg and that her \u201ccrying was constant.\u201d An ambulance was called to take her to the hospital, and although Olga was reluctant to go and sought to avoid attention from anyone in the apartment, including the medical attendants at the scene, she was eventually convinced to leave with them. Fitzpatrick followed the ambulance to the hospital and waited outside her room for ten or fifteen minutes before he went inside to question her. Approximately forty-five minutes had elapsed between the initial radio transmission and the time he went into her room at the hospital.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> When Fitzpatrick entered the hospital room, Olga \u201cstarted crying again,\u201d and he observed that she was \u201cvery upset, crying and shaking.\u201d He also \u201cnoticed the odor of liquor coming from her breath\u201d and that her eyes were \u201cvery red.\u201d His subsequent questioning of her lasted approximately forty-five minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">During the questioning, Fitzpatrick and Olga were alone. Fitzpatrick described the session:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>\u201c[L]ike I said, she speaks very little English, so I had to keep asking her questions, the same <em>question </em>over and over. I don\u2019t know if I said exactly what happened in the apartment, but she began to tell me a story [about] what had happened, not that day but a day \u2014 a few days prior to that. . . . She was very upset, crying and shaking.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b737-4\">Because of the language barrier \u201cthe whole questioning period took quite a while.\u201d The \u201cstory\u201d concerned her husband killing and burying a deformed kitten, but Fitzpatrick was unclear from her story as to when the incident actually took place.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> He repeatedly mentioned the \u201ccommunications barrier,\u201d and that he \u201creally couldn\u2019t get that [story] . . . clear from her.\u201d He then asked her if the incident with the kitten was \u201cthe reason why [the defendant] stabbed you.\u201d At that point he observed Olga nodding her head \u201cup and down.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">On cross-examination, Fitzpatrick again acknowledged that Olga\u2019s \u201cEnglish was very poor\u201d and commented that, although Olga had a hard time understanding him, he did not have a hard time understanding her.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>A spontaneous exclamation, spontaneous utterance, or excited utterance, as an exception to the hearsay prohibition, allows an extrajudicial declaration to be admitted in evidence if its reliability can be established within the rubric of the exception that pertinent authorities have repeatedly stated. See <em>Rocco </em>v. <em>Boston-Leader, Inc., </em>340 Mass. 195, 196-197 (1960); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McLaughlin, </em>364 Mass. 211, 221-223 (1973); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, </em>436 Mass. 252, 254-255 (2002); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hardy, </em>47 Mass. App. Ct. 679, 682 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b737-7\">Cases subsequent to <em>Rocco </em>v. <em>Boston-Leader, Inc., supra, </em>and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McLaughlin, supra, </em>have provided ancillary guidance. A declaration may be in the form of answers to specific questions. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fuller, </em>399 Mass. 678, 682-683 (1987); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>418 Mass. 76, 82 (1994). In <em>Grant, </em>the statements were made in response to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>questioning while the declarant was hysterical and being treated by emergency medical technicians. The statements were deemed admissible because of their inherent trustworthiness. <em>Ibid. </em>In <em>Fuller, </em>the declarant\u2019s statements were also made in response to specific questioning. In that case the declarant child\u2019s answers went beyond a simple \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d and she did not merely \u201cadopt the facts in the question.\u201d 399 Mass. at 682. The issue, therefore, is not whether the statement was made without the prompting of a question, but \u201cwhether reasonable \u2018indicia of reliability\u2019 support the statement\u2019s admissibility.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 683.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">In considering whether a writing, i.e., a facsimile transmission, can be admitted as a spontaneous utterance, the court in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DiMonte, 427 </em>Mass. 233, 239 (1998), held that, \u201c[b]ecause a writing is more suspect as a spontaneous exclamation than is an oral statement, the circumstances of the writing would have to include indicia of reliability even more persuasive than those required for an oral statement.\u201d The parties have cited no other cases from the Commonwealth or other jurisdictions that have considered nonverbal statements as spontaneous utterances.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">Other circumstances evaluated include whether the statement was volunteered by the declarant, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Crawford, </em>417 Mass. 358, 361-364 (1994) (child volunteered information, not suggested by adult questioner); the length of time between the incident and the statement, and whether the statement was \u201cinfluenced by other factors,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DiMonte, supra </em>at 239; see McCormick, Evidence \u00a7 272, at 218 (4th ed. 1992); whether the statement was made at the place of the exciting incident or at another place, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zagranski, </em>408 Mass. 278, 284-286 (1990) (statements made by wife in kitchen immediately after husband arrested for murder); or whether the statement was made during a \u201crapidly developing incident,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clary, </em>388 Mass. 583, 589 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-7\">In this case the extrajudicial declaration was introduced as the officer\u2019s observation of Olga\u2019s \u201cup and down\u201d head nod, without oral comment, interpreted by him as an affirmative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>answer to his question.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Chronologically, the nod occurred toward the end of forty-five minutes of questioning, in which the only narrative by the declarant was the deformed kitten story, an event occurring one or more days prior to the stabbing incident. There was also a serious language barrier between Olga and the questioning officer. We conclude that Olga\u2019s \u201cstatement,\u201d in these circumstances, was not made under the influence of an exciting event, and thus does not meet a foundational requirement of the exception.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The head nod was not \u201cmade under the immediate and uncontrolled domination of [her] senses,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hardy, </em>47 Mass. App. Ct. 679, 683 n.5 (1999), but was elicited by the persistent questioning of the police officer, after Olga had unambiguously attempted to avoid the attention given to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">We are mindful that the charge against the defendant is serious and that, often in domestic violence cases, the person believed to be a victim of abuse either does not testify or, as in this case, testifies contrary to expectations. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, supra </em>at 254, where the declarant narrated her story to two different police officers, prepared a consistent affidavit shortly thereafter, and then contradicted those statements in her trial testimony. In such cases, \u201cthe Commonwealth [is] confronted with a considerable challenge in proving the [case].\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DiMonte, supra </em>at 244. We also recognize that the trial judge has broad discretion in these circumstances, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zagranski, </em>408 Mass. at 285, and that in this particular case, the trial judge had little or no precedent to guide her. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DiMonte, </em>427 Mass. at 237.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">On balance, however, we conclude that Olga\u2019s nod of the head, in response to repeated questioning by a police officer, did not qualify as a spontaneous utterance. The error was prejudicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>because Olga\u2019s head nod was essentially the sole evidence of the charge against the defendant, and was forcefully argued by the prosecutor in his closing.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Accordingly, we reverse the judgment and set aside the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b736-7\">Olga was the sole defense witness at trial, and her testimony largely supported the defense theory that the wounds she received from the knife were accidental.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b736-8\">At trial, Fitzpatrick testified that the officers were dispatched in response to reports of a fight.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b736-9\">Generally, Fitzpatrick\u2019s trial testimony tracked his voir dire testimony. There were minor discrepancies concerning the lapse of time between the initial radio call and the hospital interview. The medical records introduced at trial recite that Olga arrived at the hospital at 7:30 p.m., which was one-half hour after the officers\u2019 arrival at the apartment. Officer Padellaro testified that the officers spent only one-half hour in the apartment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b737-8\">Other than her recitation of the deformed kitten story, it appears that Olga primarily answered Fitzpatrick\u2019s questions with \u201cyes\u201d and \u201cno\u201d responses.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b737-9\">It does not appear that Olga made any oral response in conjunction with the head nod, nor does it appear that she was asked for one.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b739-7\">The declarant must intend that her nonverbal conduct be an assertion. See Liacos, Massachusetts Evidence \u00a7 8.1, at 463 (6th ed. 1999). In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Marrero, </em>436 Mass. 488, 496 (2002), the court described a nodding head as \u201ccommunicative in nature . . . constituting] admissions by deliberate nonverbal expression.\u201d However, the head nods in <em>Marrero </em>were not in the context of spontaneous utterance and there was no evidence of any language barrier between the questioner and the witness.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b739-8\">We can visualize circumstances in which a nonverbal communication can be considered a spontaneous utterance, but we leave that discussion to another day.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b740-5\">The Commonwealth, while acknowledging that Fitzpatrick\u2019s testimony of his \u201cconversation\u201d with the victim was pivotal to its theory that the stabbing was deliberate and not accidental, argues that any error was obviated because Olga testified for the defense, recanted portions of her statement to Fitzpatrick, and was effectively \u201ccross-examined\u201d by the defense regarding the statement. We disagree. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Whelton, </em>428 Mass. 24, 27 (1998). The prejudice to the defendant was not eradicated.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
