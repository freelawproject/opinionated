L. c. 269, \u00a7 10(a), and of one count of receiving a firearm with the serial number defaced, G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 11C. The jury found Jones guilty of carrying ammunition, G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10(6); possessing a dangerous weapon, G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10(6); two counts of possession of a firearm without an identification card, G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10G, and possession of a firearm with a defaced serial number, G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 llC(a). The defendants advance similar claims on appeal: that the judge erred when she concluded that exigent circumstances or consent justified the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>warrantless search, and that their motions for required findings of not guilty should have been allowed. In addition, Moore argues that the judge incorrectly answered the jury\u2019s question regarding whether possessing a firearm in the bedroom of a housemate falls within the \u201cresidence\u201d defense of G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10(a). We affirm the denials of the motions to suppress and of the motions for a required finding of not guilty. With regard to Moore, we reverse the verdict of guilty on the charge of possessing a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">1. <em>The motion to suppress. </em>We summarize the judge\u2019s findings, which we supplement with undisputed evidence. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hurd, </em>51 Mass. App. Ct. 12, 13 (2001). On the evening of September 3, 1998, Boston police Officers Frank Colon and Martin Columbo went to 435 Quincy Street because the police received multiple reports of shots fired at that location. Arriving within three minutes of the police dispatch, the officers encountered an unidentified male standing in front of the three-family building who said \u201c[tjhey have a Tech-Nine up there. They have been shooting out the window of the second floor.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Accompanied by other officers, and with guns drawn, Colon went to the second floor apartment of the three-family house, while Columbo went up the back steps of the building to a landing outside the rear bedroom of the second-floor apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">Colon knocked on the door of the apartment. A man named Wendell Davis answered the door and told the officers that he rented or \u201ccontrolled\u201d the apartment. After they asked him if anything was going on in the apartment, Davis said some of his friends were in the back bedroom, and he let the police into the apartment. There were five people in the living room, including Davis. There was an odor of gunpowder in the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">Colon announced his presence and pushed open the door to the back bedroom. He smelled gunpowder in the bedroom. Colon also saw a man, later identified as M.L. Jones, lying on the bed and talking on the telephone. As Colon ordered Jones out of the bedroom, he heard muffled voices and a thud from somewhere to his left, behind the open bedroom door and inside <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>the room. Colon ordered whoever was there to leave the bedroom. Two men emerged from behind the open bedroom door. They were later identified as the defendants, Rashawn Moore and James Jones.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\">In the meantime, as Columbo approached the second-floor apartment from the rear of the building, he saw two nine millimeter shell casings under the rear bedroom window. Columbo heard voices inside the bedroom and saw the defendants standing in front of a closet with no door. Upon hearing Colon order the men out of the room, Columbo entered the bedroom through the window on the porch and accompanied the defendants to the living room. Columbo conducted a patfrisk of the three men who had been in the bedroom, but did not find any weapons.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">Colon conducted a protective sweep of the bedroom. He saw the closet with no door. On the floor of the closet, he saw a .38 caliber handgun and discharged .38 caliber shells. Next to the .38 was a blue duffle bag. Colon quickly conducted a patfrisk of the bag and felt a hard object, which he thought could be another weapon. Colon looked in the bag and found a Tech-Nine firearm. Colon seized the handguns and remained in the bedroom with the guns while the other officers completed the arrests.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">When reviewing a motion to suppress, we do not disturb the judge\u2019s findings unless they are clearly erroneous, but we conduct a de nova review of the conclusions of law. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>James, </em>427 Mass. 312, 314 (1998). The judge\u2019s findings of fact are amply supported by the evidence. At issue is whether, as the motion judge concluded, exigent circumstances justified the warrantless entry of the apartment, the back bedroom, and, ultimately, the search of the duffle bag.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">Warrantless searches in a dwelling are presumptively <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>unreasonable under art. 14 of the Declaration of Rights of the Massachusetts Constitution and the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. To support a warrantless search on the basis of exigent circumstances, the Commonwealth must demonstrate that the police had probable cause and were faced with exigent circumstances such as danger to their fives, danger to the fives of others, or the destruction of evidence, such that it would be impracticable to obtain a warrant. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Forde, 367 </em>Mass. 798, 800 (1975); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DiToro, </em>51 Mass. App. Ct. 191, 195 (2001). Whether exigent circumstances exist depends upon an evaluation of all of the attendant circumstances. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hall, 366 </em>Mass. 790, 801-803 (1975). See also Smith, Criminal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 262, at 194 (2d ed. 1983) (issues presented in cases where exigency is claimed may usually be reduced to two questions: [1] whether the authorities had reasonable grounds to believe that an exigency existed; and [2] whether the actions of the authorities were reasonable under the circumstances). Here, the facts support the judge\u2019s conclusion that the police had probable cause and faced exigent circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">The multiple reports of gunshots being fired from 435 Quincy Street, the quick response of the police, and the fact that a bystander pointed the police to the second-floor apartment and said shots had been fired from the window established probable cause and exigency.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In this regard, the case is similar to <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Paniaqua, </em>413 Mass. 796, 798 (1992), in which the court concluded that probable cause and exigent circumstances permitted a warrantless entry of an apartment and seizure of a firearm where there was a report of shots fired in an apartment and a person in the apartment building identified the apartment from which the shots were believed to have originated.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>Once the officers were inside the apartment, the exigency continued and probable cause became even more certain; not only did Davis direct the police to the back bedroom, but there was an odor of gunpowder apparent upon opening the bedroom door, and Columbo saw spent shell casings beneath the back bedroom window. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sadberry, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 934, 936 (1998) (strong odor of gunpowder is indication that gun was recently fired). Entry into the back bedroom therefore was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">Seizure of the .38 caliber handgun observed in plain view on the closet floor was also proper. \u201cUnder [the plain view] doctrine, if police are lawfully in a position from which they view an object, if its incriminating character is immediately apparent, and if the officers have a lawful right of access to the object, they may seize it without a warrant.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Santana, </em>420 Mass. 205, 211 (1995), quoting from <em>Minnesota </em>v. <em>Dickerson, </em>508 U.S. 366, 375 (1993). In light of the fact that shots had been reported fired from the dwelling, the incriminating character of the handgun was immediately apparent.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">At this link in the chain of events, the facts diverge from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Paniaqua, </em>413 Mass. 796 (1992). The defendants argue that there was no compelling reason to search the duffle bag because all eight of the people in the apartment were in the living room and under police supervision. Instead, the defendants posit that the police should have secured the apartment and obtained a warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">Given the exigency of the situation and the fact that probable cause existed to believe that at least one nine millimeter gun, still undiscovered, had been fired from the apartment window, the police were justified in opening the bag, even without conducting a preliminary tactile examination. The permissible scope of a search is determined by the purpose of the search. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, </em>389 Mass. 233, 246-247 (1983) (exigent circumstances based on automobile exception also justified warrantless search of duffle bag in automobile); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wunder, </em>407 Mass. 909, 913 (1990) (exigent circumstances justified search of closed container where there was probable cause that contraband could be in container).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">Here, although he did not have to in these circumstances, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>Colon limited the scope of his search by conducting a patfrisk of the duffle bag.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Colon was able to determine whether the weapon might be in the bag without examining its contents and was able to limit any further warrantless search of the bedroom or the apartment. Had the Tech-Nine not been in the duffle bag, Colon and the other officers could not have been confident of their safety as they completed the arrests and would have been justified in continuing to search the apartment for the gun.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Thus, \u201c[t]he search was limited in scope and occurred at a time when the suspicion of danger had not been dispelled.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tam Bui, </em>419 Mass. 392, 396, cert. denied, 516 U.S. 861 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">Regardless of how finely the law of search and seizure is parsed and labeled, the ultimate touchstone of art. 14 and the Fourth Amendment is whether a search or seizure was reasonable in the circumstances. The officers were entitled to act to insure their safety, the safety of others in the apartment, and the safety of the public. The search did not exceed the scope justified by the exigency and probable cause to believe that another gun remained on the premises. Given the facts, their conduct was reasonable. See <em>Boston Hous. Authy. </em>v. <em>Guirola, </em>410 Mass. 820, 829 (1991) (warrantless entry to secure shotgun reasonable in circumstances); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>989 F.2d 24, 26-27 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 872 (1993) (search of bathroom ceiling for sawed-off shotgun which had been displayed moments earlier reasonable). Cf. <em>Cady </em>v. <em>Dombrowksi, </em>413 U.S. 433, 447 (1973) (emergency doctrine justified entry of impounded vehicle to retrieve loaded revolver).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>2. <em>The motions for a required finding of not guilty. </em>The jury could have found facts nearly identical to those elicited at the hearing on the motion to suppress. In addition, the jury could have found that the odor of gunpowder was stronger near the bedroom and that the area in the bedroom from which Colon heard muffled voices and a \u201cthud\u201d was the same area from which the defendants emerged when ordered out by Colon.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">The defendants testified in their own defense. Both testified that they were on the bed and not near the closet when the police entered the bedroom and that there was a closed door on the closet. Moore testified that he had moved into the apartment just the day before but that he had the bedroom next to the bathroom and the back bedroom belonged to Davis. Moore moved in with several bags of clothes, but with no other possessions or furniture. Moore also testified that although he had not paid rent, he would have pulled his weight. According to Moore, he had just returned from a trip to the liquor store; he had placed the liquor in the refrigerator and had gone into the back bedroom to use the telephone when the police arrived. Moore had been in the back bedroom \u201ca lot of times\u201d because that was the location of the only telephone in the apartment and because he socialized with the \u201cowner\u201d of the room. Moore\u2019s former girlfriend testified that she had helped him move his belongings from her apartment to Davis\u2019 apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">a. <em>Possession of the .38 caliber handgun and the Tech-Nine handgun. </em>Moore and Jones each argue that there was insufficient evidence to demonstrate that they possessed the two firearms. Viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the jury could have found that the defendants had constructive, if not actual, possession. Specifically, the jury could have found that they were aware of the presence of the guns and had the ability and intention to exercise control over them. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clarke, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 502, 505-506 (1998). Contrary to their claims, there was sufficient indicia of possession, apart from mere presence, from which the jury could have concluded that the defendants were in at least constructive possession of the guns.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">The smell of gunpowder, coupled with the quick response of the police after reports of shots fired and the presence of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>spent nine millimeter casings, permitted the jury to infer that the gun had recently been fired by someone nearby. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sadberry, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. at 936 (conviction of defendant for constructive possession of handgun found underneath seat where it was reasonable to infer that defendant knew about gun because smell of gunpowder indicated someone close to it had recently fired gun). The inference was strengthened by the evidence that muffled voices and a \u201cthud\u201d were heard in the area of the room, behind the open door and near the closet where the firearms were found, and that Moore and Jones were standing by the closet. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brzezinski, </em>405 Mass. 401, 410 (1989) (defendant hiding in closet where contraband found allowed inference of consciousness of guilt). Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. 253, 257-258 (2000) (insufficient evidence to establish that defendants were in possession of firearm found under couch they were sitting on where gun was not in plain view but hidden, and there was no indication gun had been recently fired and no suspicious movements). This evidence of possession was sufficient to meet the Commonwealth\u2019s threshold burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">b. <em>The residency exemption. </em>Moore also argues that the evidence; was insufficient to establish that he possessed either gun while not in his residence, as required by G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10(a). Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the jury could have found that Moore was not \u201cin his residence.\u201d Davis had indicated to the police that he rented or controlled the apartment. Davis also referred to the people in the back bedroom as friends, suggesting that they were not roommates or cotenants. Notwithstanding Moore\u2019s testimony that he had rented the other bedroom from Davis, the evidence was sufficient to survive a motion for required finding of not guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">c. <em>The defaced serial number. </em>Both defendants claim that the evidence was insufficient to establish that they possessed the Tech-Nine with the knowledge that the serial number was defaced. General Laws c. 269, \u00a7 11C, provides that possession of a firearm that has the serial number removed, defaced, altered, obliterated, or mutilated in any manner is prima facie evidence that the person \u201chaving such possession or control is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>guilty of a violation of this section; but such prima facie evidence may be rebutted by evidence that such person had no knowledge whatever that such number had been removed . . . or by evidence that he had no guilty knowledge thereof.\u201d The defendants argue that, because possession in this case was constructive and not actual, this presumption should not apply. The statute makes no distinction between constructive and actual possession for purposes of the presumption, and we decline to read in such a distinction.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">3. <em>Answer to the jury question whether the exemption applied. </em>The jury were instructed, with regard to the exemption contained in G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10(a), that the Commonwealth was required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that \u201cthe defendant possessed the firearm outside of his residence or place of business. A person\u2019s residence does not include common areas of an apartment or office building, but only areas that are under the person\u2019s exclusive control.\u201d During deliberations, the jury asked: \u201cDo separate bedrooms in the same apartment mean that each roommate\u2019s home includes all bedrooms. Is your bedroom plus only common rooms defined as your home? Does your home include your roommate\u2019s bedroom?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">Moore asked the judge, essentially, to instruct the jury that the entire apartment, including a roommate\u2019s bedroom, fell within the meaning of the residence exemption. The judge declined and answered the jurors\u2019 question as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-7\">\u201cwith respect to your question, that the defendant possessed the firearm outside his residence or place of business. A person\u2019s residence or place of business does not include common areas of an apartment or office building, but only areas that are under that person\u2019s exclusive control. Exclusive control is a factual determination for the jury. It is not a question of law. It is for you to decide then, whether the defendant was present in or on his residence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">Moore objected to this answer; therefore, we must be satisfied that if there was error, it was not prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-9\">The original instruction and answer were correct in that they properly conveyed to the jury that whether Moore was within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>his residence for purposes of the statute was a question of fact for the jury. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dunphy, </em>377 Mass. 453, 458-460 (1979); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Morales, </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. 1034, 1035 (1982); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Belding, </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 435, 439 (1997). The instruction and answer also correctly conveyed to the jury that a person is not in their residence for purposes of the statute if they are in a common area over which they do not have exclusive control. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Statham, </em>38 Mass. App. Ct. 582, 584 n.3 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">Nevertheless, on the facts of this case, the answer to the jury\u2019s question could have misled the jury. The legislative history in this regard is instructive.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Before 1990, the statute did not include the exemption for a person present in his or her residence or place of business; however, the courts have stated that the 1990 amendment \u201cmerely put in statutory form what already had been declared by judicial exposition.\u2019\u2019 <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Statham, </em>38 Mass. App. Ct. at 584. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Belding, </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. at 437. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Seay, 376 </em>Mass. 735, 740 (1978), the court found \u201can implicit exemption from criminal liability for one who has a firearm identification card and carries a firearm within his residence or place of business,\u201d notwithstanding the silence of the statute and its failure to make a distinction among places. Reaching this conclusion by reference to G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 123, the <em>Seay </em>court pointed out that a dealer may not deliver a firearm except to an unlicensed purchaser at his \u201cresidence or place of business,\u201d and stated, \u201c[i]t is plainly unreasonable to suppose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>that the legislature intended a lawful possessor to be penalized for carrying a firearm within the very place to which a dealer may lawfully deliver it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 742.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">The facts of this case suggest that \u201cresidence\u201d here includes the entire apartment. Not only would Moore have to go through other parts of the apartment to answer the door, but the evidence contains indications that he had full use of the whole unit. He testified that after he bought liquor on the evening of September 3, he brought it into the kitchen. He had access to the apartment\u2019s only telephone, which was located in Davis\u2019s room. In these circumstances, the judge\u2019s instructions were inadequate and misleading. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dunphy, 377 </em>Mass. at 459 (term \u201cresidence\u201d retains its common-law meaning). Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jefferson, </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. 684, 687 (1994) (\u201cdwelling\u201d in G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 8A, is apartment itself and does not comprise nonexclusive hallway outside apartment).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">Our conclusion is buttressed by the fact that cases discussing the requirement that a common area be within the \u201cexclusive control\u201d of the defendant for purposes of the exemption consistently involve areas outside of the defendant\u2019s apartment or home.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Seay, </em>376 Mass. at 743 (foyer or other common area of apartment building is not within residence exemption of G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Samaras, </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 910, 910 (1980) (violation of G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10, which occurred on sidewalk in front of defendant\u2019s house, took place in location not within defendant\u2019s exclusive control); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Statham, </em>38 Mass. App. Ct. at 584-585 (whether backyard was under defendant\u2019s \u201cexclusive control\u201d was question for jury); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Belding, </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. at 440 (whether landlord was in area of \u201cexclusive control\u201d when he stuck his arm out of his apartment and fired gun into hallway was question of fact for jury).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">Properly instructed, the jury could have found that Moore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>was within his residence for purposes of the exemption even if he shared the apartment with roommates, and even if Moore possessed the gun in a roommate\u2019s bedroom. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Morales, </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. at 1035 (reasoning that even if defendant lived with girlfriend from \u201ctime to time\u201d in his apartment, this fact alone would not warrant finding that he lacked exclusive control of premises). Cf. <em>Sanford </em>v. <em>Belemyessi, 362 </em>Mass. 123, 125-126 (1972) (finding that exterior stairs and porch were used by and within exclusive control of one set of tenants).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">A more appropriate instruction, on the facts of this case, might have been as follows: the Commonwealth has the burden of proving that the defendant was not within his residence or place of business when he possessed the gun; whether the Commonwealth has proven that the defendant was not within his residence is a question of fact for you to determine; in a dwelling with multiple units, a residence may be the entire unit if the person dwelling therein is not excluded from any part thereof and has access to all the rooms; a common area is an area outside the residence to which all of the tenants in a building have access and the landlord maintains control; an area outside of the residence will still fall within the exemption if it is an area over which the defendant maintains exclusive control alone or with other members of the residence. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Statham, </em>38 Mass. App. Ct. at 585 (approving jury instruction which stated exclusive control of backyard could be maintained by defendant and other members of household).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">4. <em>Conclusion. </em>Moore\u2019s convictions for possessing a firearm, not at home or work, are reversed and remanded for a new trial. Moore\u2019s conviction for receiving a firearm with the serial numbers defaced is affirmed. Jones\u2019s convictions are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b363-10\">In addition to the charges on which this appeal is based, the complaint charged Moore with one count of discharging a firearm within five hundred feet of a building, G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 12E, for which the court allowed a motion for a required finding of not guilty; and one count of conspiracy, on which the jury found him not guilty. A separate complaint charged Jones with another count of carrying a dangerous weapon, G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10(6); one count of discharging a firearm within five hundred feet of a building, G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 12E; illegal possession of a class D substance, G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 34; and conspiracy. The judge allowed Jones\u2019 motion for a required finding of not guilty with regard to these charges.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b364-8\">A \u201cTech-Nine\u201d is a semiautomatic handgun. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ramos, </em>51 Mass. App. Ct. 901, 902 (2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b365-8\">The judge also concluded that Wendell Davis implicitly consented to the entry of the rear bedroom when he directed the officers to the rear bedroom. Jones claims that this is insufficient for valid \u201cthird party\u201d consent, and that even if Davis had the authority to consent to the bedroom entry, the consent was not voluntary considering there were five police officers at his door with their weapons drawn. Because we have determined that the officer\u2019s conduct was permissible based on probable cause and exigent circumstances, we need not consider this issue. In any event, in the circumstances, it reasonably appeared to the police that Davis possessed the apparent authority to consent to the entry into the apartment and the back bedroom. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number><em>Wahlstrom, </em>375 Mass. 115, 118 (1978); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Maloney, </em>399 Mass. 785, 787-788 (1987).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b366-7\">Moore argues that the fact that the officers knocked and waited before entering the second-floor apartment demonstrates that the police did not consider this to be an extraordinarily urgent situation. We do not fault the police for adhering to the common-law requirement of knocking and announcing their presence. Considering that the officers had probable cause to believe that someone inside the apartment had been firing a gun, this course of action likely diminished the chance of injury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b368-6\">The motion judge analogized Colon\u2019s manipulation of the duffle bag to a patfrisk of a person, and concluded that the patfrisk was proper because Colon had reasonable articulable suspicion that another firearm was in the room and that it had been used in a crime. Case law supports such patfrisks of bags or containers for weapons in limited circumstances. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sumerlin, </em>393 Mass. 127, 130 (1984), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 1193 (1985) (finding protective search proper when the bag was within reach of two men and officer felt weapon inside); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DiMatteo, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 547, 551 (1981) (reasoning it was possible, owing to soft and thin material of handbag, to feel gun inside bag). Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Silva, </em>366 Mass. 402, 410 (1974) (finding patfrisk of small bag clearly to be search for evidence rather than protective search).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b368-7\">The search of the duffle bag could also have been incident to arrest.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b372-5\">General Laws c. 269, \u00a7 10, has been amended several times since its passage in 1906.
