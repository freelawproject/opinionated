Paragraph eighteen referred the parties to a special master who was charged with implementing an equal division of designated personal property, with the assistance of expert appraisers as needed. Paragraph eight <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>provided that the parties divide their stock options equally, with the wife having the right to direct the husband to exercise any options that could not be signed over to her.</p>\n<p id=\"AX_\">While these matters remained pending, the wife moved for a restraining order against the husband and filed a complaint for contempt alleging that he was not in compliance with the divorce judgment. The case is now before us on the husband\u2019s appeal from the issuance of a limited no-contact order that the judge incorporated into the parties\u2019 preexisting divorce judgment, and from the judgment on the wife\u2019s complaint for contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"AtL\">1. The restraining order was issued nearly a year after the entry of the divorce judgment, when proceedings before the special master were ongoing. These proceedings were contentious, and the husband resorted to sending heated, derogatory correspondence to the wife and her attorneys. Of particular concern to the recipients was a series of angry and insulting letters in which the husband demanded the return of guns that he had left at the marital home.</p>\n<p id=\"Akj\">It was in this context that, on May 7, 1999, the wife filed and served a motion for relief from judgment under Mass.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(6), 365 Mass. 828 (1974), to add a provision to the divorce judgment to permanently restrain the husband from communicating directly, in any way, with her or her agents. The trial judge decided the issue without a hearing, based upon the parties\u2019 unverified written submissions, and allowed the motion under the authority of G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 18<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u2014 but only to the extent of prohibiting the husband \u201cfrom sending any form of written communication\u201d to the wife or her lawyers.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>did not provide that its violation would be a criminal offense. See G. L. c. 209A, \u00a7 7 (note 7, <em>infra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">As an initial matter, the husband contends that it was error for the judge to issue the restraining order under c. 208, \u00a7 18, because that statute applies only to pending divorce cases and could not be used when a divorce judgment already had entered. It is correct that a request under G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 18, must be made while \u201cthe action for divorce is pending.\u201d However, that requirement was met in this case. Even though the divorce judgment already had entered, all of the issues raised by the wife\u2019s divorce complaint had not been disposed of, and the special master was continuing to implement the property division under the supervision of the trial judge. The divorce action remained pending, and G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 18, could be employed to facilitate the orderly and peaceful progress of the ongoing proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-19\">The husband next disputes the judge\u2019s authority to allow the wife\u2019s rule 60(b) motion, thereby incorporating the restraining order into the divorce judgment as a permanent order.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We agree with the husband on this point. The wife was seeking to make changes to a judgment that was then the subject of a pending appeal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It therefore behooved the wife to obtain leave from the appellate court before she could have her rule 60(b) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>motion considered and allowed by the trial court.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See <em>Springfield Redev. Authy. </em>v. <em>Garcia, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 432, 434-435 (1998). Even though it was not proper in the circumstances of this case for the judge to incorporate the restraining order into the judgment, it was within her authority to issue a temporary order in furtherance of keeping the peace between the parties until the conclusion of the proceedings (in this case, for the duration of the special master proceedings), and we construe the order in that fashion.</p>\n<p id=\"AK\">Viewing the order as a temporary order, we are unpersuaded by the husband\u2019s contention that the order was defective because it was entered summarily, without a hearing. Had the order been given permanent effect or had it provided that its violation would be a criminal offense pursuant to G. L. c. 209A, \u00a7 7, we would question the propriety of granting such relief without affording the husband greater procedural protections.</p>\n<p id=\"ATP\">We draw this distinction in recognition that G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 18, has come to serve two, somewhat different, purposes. First, the statute allows a judge to respond with some immediacy and flexibility to harassing behaviors that may be temporarily exhibited by parties during divorce proceedings, but which do not rise to the level of \u201cabuse\u201d justifying intervention under G. L. c. 209A.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Second, it may be utilized for abuse prevention purposes akin to those of G. L. c. 209A, and, when used in that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>way, the serious consequences of such an order<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> require that procedural formalities like those employed in 209A proceedings be observed. See G. L. c. 209A, \u00a7 4 (requiring that notice and opportunity to be heard be afforded to defendant before ex parte temporary order may be extended); <em>Frizado </em>v. <em>Frizado, </em>420 Mass. 592, 596-598 (1995) (discussing nature and extent of defendant\u2019s procedural rights in cases brought under c. 209A).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">2. We turn now to the judgment on the complaint for contempt. On February 25, 1999, the husband moved to stay paragraph eight (the provision referring to the exercise of the stock options) pending his appeal from the divorce judgment. After a hearing, the trial judge denied the husband\u2019s motion in a written order dated March 2, 1999. On April 1, 1999, the wife filed a complaint for civil contempt alleging that the husband had failed to honor the wife\u2019s direction to exercise various stock options and had also failed to provide her with financial and tax information relating to properties that had been awarded to her, as also required by the divorce judgment. The judge held a hearing on the complaint for contempt and entered a judgment dated April 15, 1999, in which she found that, on that date, the husband finally had obeyed the divorce judgment \u201cin open court\u201d by \u201ccashing out\u201d certain stock options as directed by the wife and by releasing documents that the wife needed for income tax purposes. However, the judge also found that the husband \u201cwas obstructionist in both regards, and . . . that his conduct necessitated the filing, and the hearing, of this contempt matter.\u201d The judge therefore ordered the husband to pay the \u25a0\"-'ife\u2019s attorneys $3,000 in counsel fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">because the judge found that the husband had brought himself <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>into compliance with the pertinent requirements of the divorce judgment, we do not read the April 15, 1999, judgment on the wife\u2019s complaint for contempt as adjudicating the husband in contempt. The husband\u2019s appeal from this judgment therefore reduces itself to the argument that he should not have been assessed attorney\u2019s fees. There was, however, ample basis for the judge to exercise her discretion under G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 38, to order an award of attorney\u2019s fees payable to the wife\u2019s counsel in order to mitigate expenses incurred as a result of the husband\u2019s obstructionist conduct. We therefore find no merit in the husband\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>The judgment on the wife\u2019s complaint for contempt is affirmed. That portion of the divorce judgment incorporating the restraining order is vacated. The restraining order shall remain in effect as a temporary order until such time as the master\u2019s proceedings are concluded or for thirty days from the date of this decision, whichever is later. The wife is not precluded from seeking further restraining order protection in the trial court, if it is warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"AFY\">This statute, as amended through St. 1989, c. 341, \u00a7 93, provides that \u201c[t]he probate court in which the action for divorce is pending may, upon petition of the wife, prohibit the husband, or upon petition of the husband, prohibit the wife from imposing any restraint upon her or his personal liberty during the pendency of the action for divorce. Upon the petition of the husband or wife or the guardian of either, the court may make such further order as it deems necessary to protect either party or their children, to preserve the peace or to carry out the purposes of this section relative to restraint on personal liberty.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"AP\">The husband focuses exclusively on the prohibition against communicatians with.the wife. He makes no argument directed to the restriction on his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>communications with the wife\u2019s attorneys, and we therefore do not comment upon that feature of the order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b182-28\">In <em>Champagne </em>v. <em>Champagne, </em>429 Mass. 324, 326-327 (1999), the court held that the second sentence of \u00a7 18 allows a permanent protective order to be incorporated into a final judgment of divorce in the judge\u2019s discretion, rejecting the interpretation that the \u00a7 18 order could remain in effect only while the divorce action was pending. <em>Id. </em>at 328.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b182-33\">It appears the appeal, which has been decided in an unpublished memorandum and order of this court issued simultaneously with this opinion, was premature. To be sure, a divorce may be granted prior to and separately from a decision on support and division of property. See G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 34, (authorizing the adjudication of alimony and division of marital property \u201c[ujpon divorce or upon a complaint in an action brought at any time after a divorce . . .\u201d). Cf. <em>Cherrington </em>v. <em>Cherrington, </em>404 Mass. 267, 269-270 (1989). Here, however, alimony and property division were not sought subsequent to divorce by separate complaint. Rather, discrete aspects of the division of the parties\u2019 property were left to be addressed in the divorce case after the entry of the divorce judgment. In these circumstances, the divorce judgment was not final and appealable until that task had been completed. Generally, a divorce judgment will not be treated as an appealable judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>until all claims are finally decided, unless the trial judge, pursuant to Mass.R.Dom.Rel.P 54(b), formally directs the entry of a final judgment as to fewer than all claims. Nevertheless, given the resolution of issues in this opinion, and in the interests of judicial economy, we have decided both cases.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"Aua\">The wife maintains that she was told by an individual in the Appeals Court clerk\u2019s office that she could proceed with a motion for relief from judgment if it was \u201cunrelated\u201d to the issues on appeal. Even if she was so advised, it remained the wife\u2019s obligation to file a motion with a single justice of this court to obtain formal permission to bring her motion in the trial court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"A34\">\u201cAbuse\u201d is defined in c. 209A, \u00a7 1, as appearing in St. 1990, c. 403, \u00a7 2, as \u201cthe occurrence of one or more of the following acts between family or household members: (a) attempting to cause or causing physical harm; (b) placing another in fear of imminent serious physical harm; (c) causing another to engage involuntarily in sexual relations by force, threat or duress.\u201d The judge\u2019s decision not to designate the order in this case as criminally enforceable suggests that she did not consider the husband\u2019s behavior to constitute \u201cabuse\u201d; the order in this case was not issued on the standard form used by the Probate Court for abuse prevention orders.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b184-7\">General Laws c. 209A, \u00a7 7, as amended through St. 1996, c. 298, \u00a7 8, j ides that the violation of an order entered under G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 18, to \\ ite, to refrain from abusing the complainant, or to have no contact with the i .plainant or the complainant\u2019s minor child may be designated as a criminal ( ose. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Finase, </em>435 Mass. 310, 313-314 (2001). Such i <em>ns </em>are also required to be entered in the Statewide domestic violence rec- <em>&lt; </em>keeping system, pursuant to St. 1992, c. 188, \u00a7 7. See <em>Vaccaro </em>v. <em>Vaccaro, 425 </em>Mass. 153, 155 &amp; n. 3 (1997). Moreover, the violation of an abuse i /ention order under c. 208, \u00a7 18, which is made permanent by incorporat \u2019 into a divorce judgment, may support a conviction for stalking in viola-t, i of a court order, under G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 43(h). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Alphas, </em>430 Mass. 8, 11-12 (1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
