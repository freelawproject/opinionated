None of these claims has merit, and we affirm the judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\">1. <em>Facts. </em>Based on the evidence adduced at trial, the judge could have found as follows: Belchertown residents Thomas and Patricia Fuller were alerted by the sound of a car crash on Jenson Road in front of their house. Thomas decided to investigate while Patricia called the police. In relatively short order, he spotted the defendant, covered with blood, hobbling toward him. A wrecked vehicle, turned upside-down, was in the middle of the road. Fuller started to dial his cordless telephone. That Samaritan-like gesture was not appreciated, to put it mildly. The defendant grabbed the telephone out of Fuller\u2019s hand and yelled, \u201cDon\u2019t do it, fucker, don\u2019t do it.\u201d As the defendant spun around and threw the telephone into the nearby woods, Fuller saw a handgun in the defendant\u2019s waistband; the two stood about ten feet apart. The defendant pulled his gun and pointed it at Fuller\u2019s chest, prompting Fuller to jump behind the nearest tree. Simultaneously, he heard a gunshot, but did not know in what direction it had been fired. He ran to his neighbor\u2019s house for help and saw the defendant walking in the opposite direction toward Route 181, an adjacent highway.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">Meanwhile, Patricia Fuller heard the gunshots, called the police, and set out to find her husband. When she reached Jenson Road at the scene of the car wreck, she saw the defendant sitting on a grassy area at the side of the road. They were acquainted, so she asked, \u201cWhere\u2019s Tom?\u201d The defendant answered, \u201cHe\u2019s okay.\u201d Because the defendant continued to brandish a weapon, she ran up a hillside out of his range.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">By this time, Belchertown police Officer Edward Oey had arrived at the scene. From his patrol car, Oey saw the defendant, bleeding from his injuries, lying on the side of the road. From the top of the hill, Patricia Fuller warned him that the. defendant was armed. Oey commanded the defendant to show his hands. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>The defendant responded by puffing out his handgun and firing three more shots, this time at Oey, who drove down the road a short distance to avoid him. One shot just missed the left side mirror of his cruiser, another struck the center pillar post, and the third strayed far from the mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">Another Belchertown officer, William Zobka, then arrived in his police car. Having heard the three shots that the defendant had fired at Oey, Zobka got his shotgun from the cruiser and, with a third officer, began to move through the woods along Jenson Road in pursuit of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">At the same time, three State police officers arrived in separate vehicles and stopped beside Oey\u2019s cruiser. Those officers and Oey started to cross Jenson Road to join up with Zobka and his partner. While they were in the middle of the road, Oey and the three State police officers saw three muzzle flashes and heard three more bullets pass by them. Those shots were fired at a point about ninety feet south of where they were standing. It is not necessary to recount all of the events that followed, except to say that by the time the police had flushed the defendant out of the woods, by their estimation he had fired an additional eight to nine rounds at them. On several occasions, the State police officers were forced to return fire. Eventually, the defendant was found cowering behind a tree and was placed under arrest. On the following day, police retrieved the defendant\u2019s Clock semiautomatic pistol. Many discharged cartridges were found in areas at or near where the various officers and Thomas Fuller had confronted the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">2. <em>Alleged reliance on extrajudicial evidence. </em>The defendant called Dr. Ronald Ebert, a licensed psychologist, for the purpose of establishing that the defendant would have been unable to form the specific intent to murder, an essential element of assault with intent to murder. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Henson, </em>394 Mass. 584, 590-592 (1985). From a review of the defendant\u2019s medical records, which indicated that he was suffering from major depression, and from interviews with the defendant, Dr. Ebert formed an opinion concerning the defendant\u2019s intent. Dr. Ebert concluded that the defendant, who just before his capture had asked the police to kill him, was suicidal and was suffering from cocaine psychosis. Another physician called by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>defendant, Dr. Brian Pape, opined that the defendant\u2019s excessive use of drugs and his expressed death-wish were consistent with a person who was suicidal. The prosecution had agreed in a pretrial conference to notify the defense of any expert witnesses and their expected testimony. The defense was advised that the Commonwealth might call a medical expert, but ultimately the prosecution did not submit any expert evidence, although a government medical expert was present in the courtroom during the defense\u2019s presentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">During closing argument, defense counsel commented on the absence of any expert testimony for the Commonwealth and stated that \u201cthe deafening silence of the Commonwealth\u2019s experts, one of whom was here in the courtroom, confirmed much of what the defendant\u2019s experts had concluded about his state of mind.\u201d Then defense counsel said, \u201cI\u2019d. suggest the Court can take that into consideration.\u201d To this argument, the judge replied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-6\">\u201cI draw no adverse inference against the Commonwealth for not calling their psychologist. There was no reason to do so. He had already reviewed the testimony of Fuller and the law enforcement officers on the scene, which clearly established and convinced him that the defendant was focused in his action and on achieving the desired result of killing the target when he fired at the target.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">The plaintiff alleges that these comments by the judge suggested that she improperly relied on extrajudicial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-8\">The limitations bearing on a judge\u2019s comments on the evidence when a case is tried without a jury, were discussed in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Colon, </em>33 Mass. App. Ct. 304, 308 (1992). In that case, during defense counsel\u2019s closing argument, the judge interjected a remark regarding the defendant\u2019s entrapment defense, and implied that the defendant\u2019s supervisor at work, whom the government had used to importune him to sell cocaine to acquaintances, may not have been an agent of the government. <em>Id. </em>at 306-307. We held in <em>Colon </em>that the judge was warranted in his ultimate finding that the defendant was not entrapped, and that his remark, corroborated by the record, was nothing more than a comment that the evidence was very thin on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>agency question. <em>Id. </em>at 307. We concluded, \u201c[cjomments made by a judge in colloquy with counsel, particularly when counsel are permitted to carry on for the purpose of persuading the judge, are not to be taken as a ruling of law by the judge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>308. Moreover, \u201cit is presumed that the judge as trier of fact applies correct principles.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Milo M., </em>433 Mass. 149, 152 (2001), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Colon, </em>33 Mass. App. Ct. at 308.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">Here, the judge merely put on record her view that.she would draw no adverse inferences from the fact that the government did not use an expert witness in rebuttal. Failure of a party to call an available witness expected to give testimony on an important aspect of a case carries with it the reasonable implication that had the witness been called, he or she would have given testimony unfavorable to the party. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Schatvet, </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. 130, 134-136 (1986). That is not to say, however, that the trier of fact must draw the inference in every case. <em>Id. </em>at 134-135 (noting that inference should only be drawn in \u201cclear cases\u201d). Given the substantial evidence tending to show the defendant\u2019s specific intent to kill his pursuers and the scant evidence to negate that intent, the judge reasonably may have concluded that the Commonwealth determined that expert testimony was not needed to satisfy its burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">On the record, as the case was developed, it was open for the judge to reject the defense experts\u2019 testimony on the issue of intent. Impairment of a defendant\u2019s ability to make a decision in a normal manner, through drug use or otherwise, by no means requires an inference of inability to form specific intent. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Griffith, </em>404 Mass. 256, 259-260 (1989). Here, the Commonwealth offered eyewitness testimony showing that the defendant had engaged in a sustained and directed attack on a number of police officers. This provided a legally sufficient basis for inferring the requisite specific intent, the defendant\u2019s drug use notwithstanding.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">Positing an alternative basis for the Commonwealth\u2019s decision to refrain from calling a medical expert was well within the judge\u2019s discretion as a factfinder. While it certainly would have been better for the judge to have phrased her view of the evidence in a different way \u2014 specifically, to have avoided any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>suggestion that she had been influenced by extrajudicial evidence \u2014 we see no reversible error in her remarks. In the end, we view her comments as her opinion, as factfinder, as to the government\u2019s tactical decisions, not any reference to the judge\u2019s knowledge of unadmitted evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-4\">3. <em>Denial of the defendant\u2019s motion for a required finding. </em>The defendant contends that the Commonwealth introduced legally insufficient evidence to support his conviction for assault with intent to murder Thomas Fuller. Specifically, he alleges that, at the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s case, looking at the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, there was insufficient evidence on the element of intent. To support this argument, he refers to Fuller\u2019s direct testimony that the defendant threw the telephone to a spot just adjacent to the tree he used for cover, and Fuller heard only one shot. He relies on the Commonwealth\u2019s ballistics expert, who opined that a shot that penetrated the telephone was fired from a distance of not more than one or two feet away. From this evidence, he argues that only the shooting of the telephone was intentional, and that this is not a case in which the defendant aimed the gun at Fuller and accidentally hit the telephone.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">The argument has surface appeal, but upon a review of the record, we reject it. The aiming of the weapon at Fuller combined with the defendant\u2019s threat and his subsequent firing of the gun in close proximity to Fuller provides a sufficient basis for finding an intent to murder. While such an inference certainly was not inescapable here, that is not the standard to which the Commonwealth is held. All that is required is that evidence provide a reasonable and possible basis for inferring the existence of all of the required elements of a crime charged. We also note that the judge here was entitled to take into account the defendant\u2019s actions immediately subsequent to his confrontation with Fuller in assessing the defendant\u2019s intentions with respect to same. Looking at the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 677 (1979), there was ample evidence to support the charge of assault with intent to murder Fuller. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cullen, </em>395 Mass. 225, 230 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">4. <em>Limitation on defendant\u2019s cross-examination. </em>The defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>dant\u2019s final contention on appeal is that his constitutional right of confrontation of adverse witnesses was violated when he was prevented from delving into State police Officer Gary Hoskins\u2019s filing of a \u201cuse of force report,\u201d which Hoskins did not complete until six days after the defendant\u2019s arrest. Hoskins was one of several State police officers who had exchanged gunfire with the defendant during the chase through the woods just before the defendant\u2019s arrest. Over the defendant\u2019s objection, the following exchange occurred between defense counsel and Hoskins:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-5\">Q.: \u201cThe reason a [union] representative is there is so your superiors can\u2019t force you to write a report right away, right?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-6\">Prosecutor: \u201cObjection at this point, your Honor. Relevance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-7\">Judge: \u201cThat\u2019s sustained.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-8\">Q: \u201cBut, the fact is, any time there is use of force, this issue of force is reviewed on a number of levels, is that right?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-9\">A: \u201cThat\u2019s correct, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-10\">Q: \u201cIt\u2019s reviewed to see if use of lethal force, particularly, was properly employed, is that correct?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-11\">The judge sustained the prosecutor\u2019s objection and nothing more was asked about the subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-12\">We suppose the purpose of defense counsel\u2019s last question (there was no offer of proof) was to suggest that the witness took extra time to craft a report that exaggerated the defendant\u2019s gunslinging to justify the officers\u2019 use of their weapons against him. In his brief, the defendant argues that union representatives were present during the review inquiry \u201cto protect the police against a claim [of improper use] of their weapons,\u201d and that the delay was a prophylactic measure against a possible claim that the police had used excessive force to arrest the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-13\">Reasonable cross-examination to show bias and prejudice of a witness is a matter of right. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ahearn, </em>370 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>Mass. 283, 287 (1976); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hanson, </em>394 Mass. 584, 586 (1985). However, this rule is not ironclad; weighed in addition is the correlative principle that the right of cross-examination is not infringed by reasonable limitations as, for example, where the matter sought to be elicited has been sufficiently aired. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Doherty, </em>394 Mass. 341, 349-350 (1985); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rodwell, </em>394 Mass. 694, 700 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">The discretion of the trial judge in determining the extent to which counsel may explore otherwise immaterial lines of inquiry is considerable. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dominico, </em>1 Mass. App. Ct. 693, 714-715 (1974). Such was the tangential nature of the excluded questions that we do not think the judge abused her discretion. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sendele, </em>18 Mass. App. Ct. 755, 761 (1984). The judge limited defense counsel\u2019s questioning of Hoskins along the lines of the nature of the internal review. However, she permitted defense counsel to establish that a report had been filed and the conditions that required the filing. We hasten to add that the mere fact that Hoskins was required to file the report does not, by itself, establish bias.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">While the defendant\u2019s appeal speculates that further questioning might have revealed an ulterior motive to inflate the danger, defense counsel did not raise this point with the judge. Where it is not clear that the proffered question seeks evidence of bias, the cross-examiner must be prepared to explain the relevance. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cheek, </em>374 Mass. 613, 614-615 (1978). It is incumbent upon the proponent to make a \u201cplausible showing\u201d that circumstances supporting the claim of bias actually exist. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tam Bui, </em>419 Mass. 392, 399-400, 401-402, cert. denied, 516 U.S. 861 (1995). This did not occur. <em>Id. </em>at 401-402. Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Civello, </em>39 Mass. App. Ct. 373, 374-378 (1995); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. 208, 211-213 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b623-7\">The judge f\u00f3und the defendant not guilty on one other count each of armed assault with intent to murder and assault with a dangerous weapon.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
