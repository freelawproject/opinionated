The answer was: \u201cShe said she did not know anything about his business, that she didn\u2019t \u2014 \u201d when an objection was interposed and sustained because the evidence was incompetent and immaterial. We agree with that ruling'. If plaintiff performed the services agreed upon, it made no difference what she knew or did not know about decedent\u2019s business. Moreover, the answer was directly and fully responsive to the question, and anything additional would not have been responsive to it. The last assignment has no exception to support it, and will be disregarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">As the first four assignments must all be dismissed unless defendant was entitled to binding instructions in his favor, the evidence favorable to plaintiff and every reasonable inference therefrom must be taken as true, and every unfavorable allegation and inference must be rejected. Viewed in this aspect the record discloses the following facts: Plaintiff, who was a niece of decedent, had been employed as housekeeper in her grandfather\u2019s house for a period of twelve or fourteen years, and until <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>Ms death on May 26, 1904. During that time Isaac McGill, whose administrator is defendant in this case, had been living there with his said father, and was acquainted with the character of services performed by plaintiff. On his father\u2019s death, Isaac McGill inherited the property, and requested plaintiff to continue taking charge of the house. At first she refused to do so, but upon his saying to her \u201cif she went back he would leave her everything he had, his farm and all his personal property at his death if she went back and kept house with him\u201d she thereupon went back in June, 1904, and continued to perform the services agreed upon until her health broke down and she was taken to the State hospital at North Warren, Pa. On her return home therefrom he called to see her and said \u201cif she would go back he would live up to his contract and she should have everything he had at his death.\u201d Eelying thereon she did go back and performed the services agreed upon until his death on February 4, 1918. The value of her services was variously estimated at from $1 a day to $9 a week, and the period she lived with him after the first making of the contract, excluding the fifteen months or thereabouts during which she was away on account of illness, covered a period of 645 weeks. The verdict was in her favor for $3,277.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">In the argument in this court defendant raises three questions: 1st. Was the alleged contract sufficiently proven? and under this head the only point made is: Was there sufficient evidence of her acceptance of the contract ? 2d. Was there a breach of the contract shown ? in view of the fact that there was no evidence decedent did not make a will as plaintiff alleged he agreed to do. 3d. Was there \u201csufficient evidence from which the jury can find an amount due plaintiff?\u201d which may be dismissed without further consideration in view of the testimony above set forth as to the time covered by and the value of the services rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">It was not necessary to prove, as defendant seems to think, that plaintiff should formally write or state her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>acceptance of defendant\u2019s offer. She accepted it in a far more certain way, by performing services under it for many years. We said in Graham v. Dempsey, 169 Pa. 460,462: \u201cThat actions speak louder than words is sound law as well as proverbial wisdom\u201d; and, as directly relevant to the present case (Patton\u2019s Executor v. Hassinger, 69 Pa. 311, 314), \u201cthere is nothing more significant of the acceptance of a provision than a compliance with it, especially where notice of acceptance is not required,\u201d and (Hoffman v. Bloomsburg, etc., R. R. Co., 157 Pa. 174, 194, quoting from Hare on Contracts 313), \u201cthe fulfillment of that which the promisor stipulates therefore is deemed the best and sufficient proof of assent.\u201d There was, therefore, ample proof of acceptance, even aside from the evidence of the witnesses who said, when referring to the original contract, \u201cshe went back under those conditions,\u201d and, when referring to the time of her return from the hospital, \u201che said if she would go back he would live up to his contract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b151-3\">Nor does the fact that the plaintiff failed to prove decedent did not make a will leaving his entire estate to her, present any greater difficulty. It was admitted the register of wills of the county in which decedent was domiciled, had granted to defendant letters of general administration on decedent\u2019s estate, and we have said this \u201cbeing a judicial\u201d act \u201ccannot be attacked or avoided in a collateral proceeding\u201d: Ziegler v. Storey, 220 Pa. 471, 476. Moreover it was the duty of the register before granting the letters to satisfy himself that decedent had left no valid will, and from the presumption of that duty performed prima facie no valid will existed: Kelly v. Creen, 53 Pa. 302; Murphy v. Chase, 103 Pa. 260. Besides, under the facts aforesaid and in view of the impossibility of certainly proving there was no will, and the reasonable possibility of proving it if there was one, the burden of proof of its existence, if one had been alleged in the pleadings, which it was not, was upon defendant who now affirms its possible existence. And, finally, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>even if we assume error in this respect, it was harmless and hence would not justify a reversal, for, under such a will as decedent agreed to make, plaintiff would have received his entire estate, and by this verdict she cannot possibly get more, and may get much less.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
