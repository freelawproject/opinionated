In an action against a railroad company to recover damages for personal injuries suffered by plaintiff in a collision between his wagon and a train at a grade crossing, the plaintiff cannot recover because of contributory negligence, where it appears from his own evidence, that, as he approached the crossing, with which he was familiar, he stopped, looked and listened, at a point some twenty feet from the nearest track; that the safety gates were up; that, because of intervening buildings and cars, he was unable to obtain a view of the road from which the train which struck him was coming, until he reached the first track; that after stopping he drove on slowly, without stopping or looking again, and was struck on the second track.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b44-7\">2.

He had without mishap crossed the first track, the track used for westbound traffic, and had just about cleared the second track, used for eastbound traffic, when a passing train struck the rear wheel of his wagon with the result that he was thrown from the wagon, more or less injured, and the contents of the wagon were scattered indiscriminately. The only defense set up on the trial with which we have now concern was contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff. At the conclusion of the evidence the defendant requested binding instructions to the effect that such-negligence having been shown, there could be no recovery, which instruction was refused. The result of the trial was a verdict in favor of the plaintiff in $4,000. A motion for a new trial and judgment n. o. v. followed. In answer to the rule issued, and to avoid a new trial, plaintiff filed a remittitur of all in excess of $2,000, and thereupon judgment was rendered for the latter amount and the rule granted was discharged. The appeal is from the judgment so rendered. The only assignment of error <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>that calls for consideration is the first, which complains of error in the court\u2019s refusal to instruct that the plaintiff was guilty of such contributory negligence as to prevent his recovery in the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">The facts upon which defendant relies to support its present contention are derived entirely and exclusively from the plaintiff\u2019s own testimony. A brief recital of them is all that may be necessary. Th.e plaintiff was thoroughly familiar with the crossing on which the accident happened, having been long accustomed to drive over it, as often as three times a week in the course of his business. On this occasion when approaching it he stopped, looked and listened at a point some twenty feet from the nearest track. At this point he observed that the safety gates at the railroad were not lowered, but, because of intervening buildings to his right, he was unable to obtain a view of the road to the west, the direction from which the train that collided with his wagon was approaching. No view of the track was observable until the first track had been reached because of building obstructions and some box cars that were on the siding. He says he stopped at this point long enough to look and listen, and not seeing or hearing anything to indicate the approach of a train, \u2014 we here use his exact language,\u2014 \u201cThen I drove on, I didn\u2019t go in a hurry. I just drove my horse on a walk......I didn\u2019t hear nothing and I didn\u2019t see nothing, all at once whrrp! and I was struck, I didn\u2019t know what happened until afterwards.\u201d Further on he was asked this question: \u201cAnd do you say that when you got on the westbound track you couldn\u2019t see the train coming on the eastbound track?\u201d Answer: \u201cWell I didn\u2019t see no train.\u201d This examination followed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-7\">Q. \u201cYou can see then when you are on the track, can you ?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-8\">A. \u201cYes; if you see anything coming, you can see. But I didn\u2019t hear nothing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-9\">Q. \u201cAnd the instant you got on the eastbound track you were struck, were you?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>A. \u201cYes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-3\">Q. \u201cYou didn\u2019t stop on the westbound track, did you?\u201d A. \u201cI stopped on the other side of the track.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-4\">Q. \u201cHow far away, \u2014 twenty feet you said?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-5\">A. \u201cAbout twenty feet or so.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-6\">Q. \u201cAnd then you drove right on and didn\u2019t stop again?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-7\">A. \u201cNo, because I didn\u2019t hear nothing and see nothing. There was nothing to hear and nothing to see.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-8\">Q. \u201cAnd that train was going on the eastbound track, was it not?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-9\">A. \u201cOn the eastbound track, yes, toward the station.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Am9\">Q. \u201cAnd it came from Bethlehem Junction, in that direction?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-10\">A. \u201cI don\u2019t know where it came from, I didn\u2019t see it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A8v\">Q. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t on the track when you drove on?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-11\">A. \u201cIt must have been but how far away I don\u2019t know.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A9c\">With these as the established facts in the case, it is impossible to reach other conclusions than that the plaintiff failed utterly in several' respects to meet the requirements which the law imposes on all travelers under similar circumstances. First, he was negligent in advancing upon the tracks with his horse and wagon under the circumstances. In approaching the crossing he stopped to look and listen when within twenty feet of the track, at a point where the railroad track was absolutely concealed from his view and where, to one approaching the crossing as he did, it would remain absolutely conce\u00e1led until the first track was reached. The plain duty that the law enjoins under such circumstances is that the traveler go upon the track itself and look and listen before attempting to drive his team across: Lehigh Valley R. R. v. Brandtmaier, 113 Pa. 610; Penna. R. R. v. Ackerman, 74 Pa. 265; Penna. R. R. v. Beale, 73 Pa. 504; Kinter v. Penna. R. R., 204 Pa. 497.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-12\">Again; it is settled law that, when one has entered upon the tracks of a railroad with a view to crossing over, the duty continues to rest upon him throughout to exer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>cise Ms senses to discover danger; he must continue to look and listen. This duty was manifestly disregarded in this case. According to Ms own testimony the first opportunity he had to look westward upon the tracks of the railroad was when he reached the first track; at that point he had an unobstructed view. Without stopping, because as he said he saw nothing and heard nothing, he drove to the next track when he was instantly struck by the passing train. The statement that he looked and listened when upon the first track and neither heard nor saw the oncoming train is incredible. We said in Carroll v. Penna. R. R., 12 W. N. C. 348, and have had frequent occasion to repeat it, that it is vain for a man to say that he looked and listened, if, in spite of what his eyes and ears must have told him, he walked directly in front of a moving locomotive. That is just what the plaintiff here did. That he was driving rather than walking can make no possible difference with respect to his duty. Nor did the fact that, when he entered upon the crossing, the safety gates were not lowered, relieve him from the duty of exercising the care required under the circumstances. In Greenwood v. Phila., W. &amp; B. R. R. Co., 124 Pa. 572, we said, speaking through Chief Justice Paxson : \u201cConceding that the company was required to take extra precautions by reason of the gates being out of order, yet the plaintiff was also bound to do his part. He has no right to omit the ordinary precautions when approaching a railroad crossing merely because he finds the gates up. ......In all such cases the safety of the traveling public requires that each party shall be held to the exercise of due care.\u201d From the plaintiff\u2019s own narrative of the occurrence it is impossible to reach any other conclusion than that his own want of care, or negligence, contributed to the happening of the accident from which he suffered his injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">The judgment is reversed and judgment is now em tered for the defendant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
