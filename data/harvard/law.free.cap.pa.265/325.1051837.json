J., filed September 26,1919, as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b350-7\">There can be no doubt that the plaintiff was bound to pay the income tax and the war excess profits taxes assessed against it for the year 1917 by the federal government. By clause third of the lease under which defendant occupies and operates the plaintiff\u2019s property, the former agreed to pay all taxes and assessments upon the rent reserved by the latter in that instrument, for the payment of which taxes the plaintiff would otherwise be liable. The defendant failed to pay the war excess profits tax assessed against the plaintiff for the year 1917 and it has been paid by the plaintiff, which brings this action to secure reimbursement for that which it has thus expended. It was held by our Supreme Court in North Pennsylvania R. R. Co. v. Phila. &amp; Reading Ry. Co., 249 Pa. 326, that a covenant by the lessee to pay all taxes imposed upon the rent payable under such a lease as that with which we are here concerned, obligated it to pay the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>United States income tax assessed against the lessors whose annual income consisted of the rental payable by the lessee. In Philadelphia City Passenger Ry. Co. v. Phila. Rapid Transit Co., 263 Pa. 561, it was decided that in this respect the war excess profits tax stood upon the same footing with the income tax on net profits. This case is ruled by this precedent. Further discussion of the subject is not necessary. Rule for judgment is affirmed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b351-3\">Defendant appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b351-4\"><em>Error assigned </em>was the order of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b351-5\"><em>Abraham M.
