State, </em>8 Md. App. 635, 636 (1970). The privilege is not absolute. Whether the disclosure, once demanded, is to be compelled is within the sound discretion of the court. <em>Gulick </em>v. <em>State, </em>252 Md. 348, 354 (1969). Such exercise of discretion calls for a balancing of the public interest in protecting the flow of information to the police against the individual\u2019s equal, if not predominant, right to a fair defense on the merits. <em>Roviaro v. United States, </em>353 U.S. 53, 62 (1957); <em>Franks v. Delaware, </em>438 U.S. 154 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">The exercise of discretion is proportionately restricted by the significance of the disclosure to the accused\u2019s ability to defend on the merits. If the informant merely informed, but did not witness or participate in the criminal act the judge\u2019s discretion is relatively broad; however, even his decision to disclose is subject to appellate hindsight. See <em>Gulick, supra. </em>But when it is indicated upon demand that disclosure is necessary and relevant to a fair defense on the merits, the identity of the informer <em>must </em>be disclosed if that charge is to go forward. <em>Nutter, supra </em>at 638; see also <em>Gulick, supra </em>at 354, 357; <em>Drouin v. State, </em>222 Md. 271, 286 (1960). It is prejudicial error to withhold the identity of such undercover employees in the face of repeated demands for disclosure when the informer\u2019s</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-9\">\" 'possible testimony was highly relevant ...,\u2019\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aou\">as that which</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-10\">\"'might have disclosed an entrapment</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b122-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>or that an informant</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-5\">\" 'might have testified to petitioner\u2019s possible lack of knowledge of the contents of [a] package that he <em>'transported\u2019..\" McCray </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>386 U.S. 300, 310 (1967), quoting <em>Roviaro v. United States, </em>353 U.S. at 63-64.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">\n<em>The Instant Case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">In the case we review, Carl James Hardiman was convicted by a jury in the Circuit Court for Cecil County of possession and distribution of methamphetamine. The State\u2019s evidence consisted solely of the testimony of an undercover police officer who testified that he had purchased an amount of methamphetamine from appellant at his home, after having been introduced to him by a confidential informant named \"Tinker\u201d or \"Joe\u201d. According to the officer, Tinker simply introduced him to appellant, and the appellant negotiated and consummated the sale, after which both the officer and Tinker left appellant\u2019s trailer home.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">Appellant\u2019s defense was that he had been entrapped into the transaction by Tinker (or Joe), to whom he had been introduced previously.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-9\">\"Q On December 7, 1980, were you visited at your home by Officer William Alan Athas, or Athas and one other person known to you by the name of Joe in the late hours of the day?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-10\">A Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-11\">Q O.K.

What did he ask you to do with it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-18\">A He asked me could I bring it down to my house.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-19\">Q And that house would be the one that you occupied, the trailer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-20\">A Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-21\">Q And you did that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-22\">A Yes, sir, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-23\">Q Did he tell you what he wanted you to do with it other than take it down to your house?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-24\">A He said he\u2019d be there to pick it up.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b124-25\">According to appellant he did come by \"to pick it up,\u201d with the undercover officer in tow in a day or two.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-26\">\"Q He\u2019d be there to pick it up and he did, in fact, come to your place, as you have testified already, on the 7th of February, did he not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>A I can\u2019t remember exact date, but he did come to my house.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-5\">Q With the officer who was in this Court earlier today, Officer Athas?

When did he tell you that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-20\">A The day at Danny Johnson\u2019s.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-21\">Q At Johnson\u2019s?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-22\">A Yes, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b125-23\">The money was left on the table when the officer and Tinker left the trailer, apparently also to be subsequently delivered to Tinker.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-24\">On cross-examination appellant addressed some of the more obvious implications arising from so peculiar a transaction.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-25\">\"Q All right. And you\u2019re saying that the $65.00, then, would have been his, is that what you are saying?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>A I guess so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-5\">Q But yet and you\u2019re saying it was no conversation, here\u2019s a man that\u2019s supposed to own this, comes to your house and the buy is made from you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-6\">Can you explain that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-7\">A I don\u2019t guess he wanted this officer to know or something because he was at Mr. Johnson\u2019s five or six times without him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-8\">Q I see.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-9\">A I seen him there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-10\">Q But you didn\u2019t say anything, 'Hey this is your $65.00,\u2019 did you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-11\">A No, sir, I did not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-12\">Q And you kept the money, didn\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-13\">A No, sir, I did not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-14\">Q When, well, they left without the money, the money was, remained in your house, is that, isn\u2019t that what you\u2019re saying?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-15\">A At the present time, yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-16\">Q And you say you took it up to this Johnson and gave it to him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-17\">A Yes, sir, the next day.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b126-18\">While it appeared from appellant\u2019s testimony that he might have known Tinker well enough to have been entrusted with his possessions (as well as his money) and that Tinker had been to his home once or twice,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-19\">\"Q All right, but Tinker was not at your house before 9:00 on February the 7th? That night, that was the first time he was at your house was that night with Trooper Athas, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-20\">A No, sir, he was there once or twice before with</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b126-21\">appellant denied knowing Tinker\u2019s true identity.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-22\">This trial testimony conformed with appellant\u2019s pretrial proffers in, and on, his Motion to Compel Discovery of the undisclosed informant. Consistently he had proclaimed his purpose in demanding the informant\u2019s name. As incredibly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>naive (or inherently unbelievable) as appellant\u2019s story may make him appear, it is not our role on appeal, nor the trial judge\u2019s on weighing the demand, to decide the credibility of a proffered defense submitted to assess the purpose of disclosure. Appellant contended then, and contends now, that he was entrapped and his purpose in requiring the State to furnish him \"the name and address of the confidential informer known as 'Joe\u2019 or 'Tinker\u2019 \u201d was to verify his version of the incident. Without Tinker\u2019s tale, it would be appellant\u2019s word, credibly crippled by prior convictions and an unspoken missing witness inference, against the word of an officer of the law. Tinker\u2019s tale told as his own, appellant believes, would have vindicated him.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">We are in no position on appeal to say him nay for our role of factfinding upon review is severely limited. See <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307 (1979). Review of the record reveals that appellant clearly met his burden of showing that disclosure of the informant\u2019s identity was necessary and relevant to a fair defense by proffer in furtherance of his demand for disclosure. <em>Whittington v. State, </em>8 Md. App. 676, 678 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">There was nothing for the judge to balance on the suppression side of the scale as far as this record reveals. No hearing was held on the Motion to Compel Discovery save only a colloquy between counsel and the court on the morning of trial. Despite appellant\u2019s repeated proffers of the purpose of proving his entrapment defense, the State was never called upon to respond at a hearing with a reason for its denial of disclosure; although it had set forth three \"reasons\u201d in an unverified Answer to Motion to Compel Discovery.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-7\">\"1. The evidence as produced at the Motion to Suppress does not indicate in any way that the defendant was induced to commit the offense which he would not otherwise have committed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-8\">2. The State at the present time does not know the whereabouts of 'Joe\u2019 AKA 'Tinker.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-9\">3. The testimony of 'Joe\u2019 AKA 'Tinker\u2019 is not material to the defense of the accused.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b128-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>The first and third response are not reasons at all. They are conclusions; the first a non sequitur and the third a conjecture. If the testimony of Tinker was that which was proffered, it was certainly \"material\u201d regardless of how a factfinder might receive it. The State\u2019s second answer, if evidentiarily proven, may have been justified in responding to the request to disclose Tinker\u2019s whereabouts. It does not respond to why the State should not disclose Tinker\u2019s proper name or his last known address.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">The record also revealed a unique substitute for a hearing. On the day of trial when the court was called upon by counsel to rule upon his motion, the judge sent him to the State\u2019s Attorney</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-6\">\"to see if either the State\u2019s Attorney or any personnel there could tell you about your question.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">Counsel\u2019s inquiries to the police officer and the Assistant State\u2019s Attorney as to Tinker\u2019s whereabouts received the reply that counsel should seek the information by hearing on the motion in court. Upon reporting back to the court, rather than proceeding with a hearing, the judge recited for the record what he (the judge) had personally done.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-8\">\"I immediately went to the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office, where I met Mr. Scarborough and Trooper Athas and some other officers. And they told me that they did not know where he was and gave me certain other information that tended to substantiate and confirm that they didn\u2019t know where he was. This was followed by two telephone calls to relatives of the individual, made in my presence and while I listened, and neither of those persons knew where he was, nor had heard from him for quite some time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-9\">And I am satisfied from your efforts and my efforts and the candidness and steps taken by the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office and the State Police that they do not know where he is and that they do not know how to go about finding out where he is, and period.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b129-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>For purposes of our review that well intentioned \u2014 if somewhat unprecedented \u2014 procedure, is not a sufficient substitute for a hearing despite the fact that we are assured by the judge that he</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-5\">\"has tried to be very objective and have the interest of the Defendant very much in mind in [his] conversation with the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office and the State Police, and tries now to relate very honestly what happened and his feelings about the matter and his belief as to the inability to find the individual.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">The State was never called upon to justify its nondisclosure, as far as this record reveals. Even if we were to accept the judge\u2019s confirmation of the State\u2019s allegation of ignorance of Tinker\u2019s whereabouts (which is obviously beyond our judicially cognizable ken) the more pointed problem, according to appellant on this appeal, was Tinker\u2019s identity rather than his address. Counsel doggedly persisted in seeking disclosure of his identity.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-7\">\"MR. GOODRICK: Did the Court learn of the name of Joe or Tinker?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-8\">THE COURT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-9\">MR. GOODRICK: Would the Court direct the State\u2019s Attorney to release that information?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-10\">THE COURT: No.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b129-11\">When asked for the reason for his refusal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-12\">\"MR. GOODRICK: Would the Court put on record why?\u201d,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b129-13\">the court replied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-14\">\"Because of matters of security with respect to the individual, his own personal safety.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b129-15\">Nowhere in the record is there even an evidentiary suggestion that the personal safety of the informant had been jeopardized. Even during trial the only allusion came when an officer was asked generally to describe a confidential <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>informant to the jury. His lengthy definition concluded with the sentence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-5\">\"And the information given is also of a confidential nature to ensure the informant\u2019s safety.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">In relation to Joe or Tinker, however, some such suggestion was made but once again only in a general way indicating that it was a procedurally anticipatory safeguard rather than due to a direct or known personal threat of harm to Tinker (or Joe as he was alternately called).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-7\">\"Q O.K. And is that the way this fella, Joe, operated in relationship to this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-8\">A That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-9\">Q O.K. As a part of your relationship with him or any agreement with him, what was involved with reference to would he ever be required to be a witness in any case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-10\">A He voluntarily offered his assistance and as in return for the voluntariness of his assistance, he was informed that he would not have to testify.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-11\">Q O.K. Is that, again, a security measure?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-12\">A That\u2019s correct.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b130-13\">Again we note that this is all post-mortem. The testimony is trial testimony relating to the disclosure issue. Disclosure was denied without any taking of evidence, or even proffer of evidentiary facts by the State. Yet even considering this after the fact testimony, the scale tilts heavily in favor of disclosure, indicating that the original error was clearly not a harmless one. On the State\u2019s side of the scale is a general rule of <em>procedural </em>security, but without any evidence of a threat to Tinker personally. On the appellant\u2019s side of the scale, as in <em>Roviaro, </em>were the facts that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-14\">\"[Tinker] had helped to set up the criminal occurrence and had played a prominent part in it. His testimony might have disclosed an entrapment.... He was the only witness who might have testified to petitioner\u2019s possible lack of knowl<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>edge of the contents of the package that he 'transported\u2019 .... The desirability of calling [Tinker] as a witness, or at least interviewing him in preparation for trial, was a matter for the accused rather than the Government to decide.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 64.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">Absent some evidence of danger to the life or lives of the informant (or others) threatened by the revelation of the identity, there is a very small auncel on the State\u2019s side of the scale. The right to produce one\u2019s only defense must predominate over protecting the State\u2019s flow of information \u2014 as important as that purpose may be. <em>Id. </em>at 61-62.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">The record reveals that appellant did all that he was permitted to do to compel revelation of the informant\u2019s name, and what he did was all that was necessary to shift the burden to the State. See <em>Nutter, supra </em>at 649. The State, on the other hand, stood silent and offered not a single auncel to its side of the judicial balance. We hold, therefore, that the judge abused his discretion by declining to compel disclosure and such failure was prejudicial error requiring reversal and retrial. See <em>Rovario </em>and <em>Nutter, </em>both <em>supra. </em>We need not, therefore, address appellant\u2019s \"independent reason\u201d for reversal</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-7\">\"that since a hearing was required and since Appellant was not present at two parts of such 'hearing\u2019 as was held, there was error of constitutional dimension in the procedure adopted by the court. Constitution of the United States, Amendments V, VI, XIV; Declaration of Rights, Constitution of Maryland, Articles 21 and 24; Maryland Rule 724. See also e.g., <em>Bunch v. State, </em>281 Md. 680; <em>Tisdale v. State, </em>41 Md. App. 149; <em>State v. Collins, </em>265 Md. 70.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-11\">We assume that upon remand such procedural oversight will be averted.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-12\">In concluding we note that the State\u2019s reliance upon <em>McCoy v. State, </em>216 Md. 332 (1958), was misplaced, if not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>misleading. Although it seemingly concedes that \"Tinker\u201d was an integral part of the illegal transaction and may thus be subject to an exception to the general rule of nondisclosure, <em>Whittington v. State, supra </em>at 678, the State claims that there is an exception to the exception. The <em>\"McCoy </em>exception,\u201d according to the State\u2019s interpretation, is that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-5\">\"disclosure of the name of the informer is not required where the informer is already known to the accused.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">That is neither the holding nor the dicta of <em>McCoy.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">The only issue related to an informant\u2019s identity in <em>McCoy </em>was whether the State\u2019s failure to <em>produce </em>the informer was a denial of due process and whether the evidence was sufficient to convict without such informer\u2019s testimony. <em>Id. </em>at 336. Disclosure or nondisclosure of an informant\u2019s identity was not even an issue in <em>McCoy. </em>Not only did <em>McCoy </em>know the informer, but he never made demand before or at trial of his identity, which was, as a matter of fact, revealed readily during the State\u2019s case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 339. It was in that context that the Court reflected that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-8\">\"If <em>the accused knows the identity of the informer, </em>or, if the name of the informer is not known to the accused, but he fails to make proper demand at the trial for a disclosure of the identity of the informer, <em>there is no prejudicial error </em>if the accused has had ample opportunity to summon or call the informer to the trial. <em>Id. </em>at 338 (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>But harmless error which must be decided on a case by case basis, and beyond a reasonable doubt, <em>Dorsey v. State, </em>276 Md. 638 (1976), is not to be confused with a rule of law holding that disclosure is never required where an informer\u2019s identity is known to an accused. The \"rule\u201d is quite the contrary:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-5\">\"If the identity of the informer is admitted or known, then there is no reason for pretended concealment of his identity, and the privilege of secrecy would be an artificial obstacle to proof.\u201d 8 J. Wigmore, <em>Evidence </em>\u00a7 2374, at 766 (1961).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">In <em>Roviaro, supra </em>at 60, the Supreme Court clearly adhered to Wigmore\u2019s understanding of the law when it said that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-7\">\"... once the identity of the informer had been disclosed to those who would have cause to resent the communication, the privilege is no longer applicable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">By footnote the Court reiterated its understanding that an accused\u2019s knowledge of an informant did not support the government\u2019s right to withhold the identity \u2014 it destroyed the government\u2019s privilege to withhold it.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b133-9\">The lead headnote in <em>McCoy </em>seems to espouse that upon which the State relies. We remind the State, however, that it is the holding of Court, not the opinion of a headnoter, that provides us the authority we must follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-10\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b133-11\">\n<em>Case remanded for retrial.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b133-12\">\n<em>Costs are not reallocated as part of the judgment of this Court pursuant to Maryland Rule 1082f.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b132-9\">. \"In the case at bar the defendant admitted in his statement to the police lieutenant that he knew the informer.
