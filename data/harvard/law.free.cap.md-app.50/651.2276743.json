Summers was sentenced to nine years imprisonment for the breaking conviction, with concurrent one year sentences for the malicious destruction and rogue and vagabond convictions. Brown was sentenced to eight years on the breaking conviction, with concurrent one year sentences for the malicious destruction and rogue and vagabond convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-8\">Appellant Summers contends the trial court committed reversible error by denying his request for a postponement.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-9\">Both appellants contend:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-10\">1. The evidence was insufficient to sustain all convictions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-11\">2. The offenses of malicious destruction of property and rogue and vagabond merge into the offense of breaking with intent to steal property valued at over $300.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-12\">3. They were denied their constitutional right to counsel when the trial court forced them to proceed with the trial without the aid of counsel.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b674-13\">We find all contentions without merit and shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-14\">The facts are uncomplicated. The manager of an Exxon station and repair shop in Queen Anne\u2019s County, concerned over recent burglaries returned to the station \u2014 after it had been secured and closed for the day \u2014 with the express purpose of preventing any further burglaries. He arrived <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>about 10:00 p.m. and got into a parked car where he could observe the premises. At approximately 12:15 a.m., he observed two men, one carrying a five-gallon bucket of water, come to the front of the station from the restrooms. One of the men hid behind a car while the other climbed on a pile of junk under a window, looked inside, and then broke the window. As that man was reaching inside the broken window, the manager, armed with a rifle, apprehended the two men. A state trooper arrived shortly thereafter and placed the two men, identified as the appellants herein, under arrest. Appellants explained their actions to the state trooper as necessary for them \"to get another container to put water in for their disabled car.\u201d The trooper ascertained that an alleged disabled vehicle containing two passengers was parked about one-quarter of a mile from the station.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">We shall first address appellant Summers\u2019 contention that the lower court erred in refusing to grant a postponement. Two motions for continuance had been previously granted to Summers (February 21, 1980 and April 28, 1980), when, on July 8, 1980, Summers again requested a postponement of the trial scheduled for July 9, 1980. This request was based upon the fact that Summers\u2019 mother was in a coma and expected to die. When considering a motion for postponement, the trial court is governed by Maryland Rule 746 (b) which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-6\">\"Upon motion of a party made in writing or in open court and for good cause shown, the county administrative judge or a judge designated by him may grant a change in trial date.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">Appellant argues that the condition of his mother constituted \"extraordinary cause\u201d necessitating a postponement, a denial of which constituted a clear abuse of the trial court\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>The trial court ascertained that the doctor could not predict how long Summers\u2019 mother would live, the case had been postponed twice before, the expected trial time was one day, and decided that if she died before trial a postponement would be granted. Based upon these facts we cannot say that the trial court\u2019s denial of the requested postponement amounted to a clear abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Hicks, </em>285 Md. 310 (1979); <em>Chance v. State, </em>45 Md. App. 521 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">We shall now address the three contentions made jointly by appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">I. <em>Sufficiency</em></p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">Appellants contend that the proof of breaking with the intent to steal goods of the value of over $300 was insufficient to convict because of a lack of proof of felonious intent. The intent here was proven by the circumstances \u2014 climbing upon a pile of junk to reach and break a window in the middle of the night at a closed gasoline station containing goods inside in excess of the value of $300. It is not necessary that goods actually be taken to prove the intent to steal. <em>Herbert v. State, </em>31 Md. App. 48 (1976); <em>Sparkman v. State, </em>3 Md. App. 527 (1968). Appellants also argue that their explanation that \"they were merely attempting to obtain a container from within the building to obtain water for their disabled car,\u201d was sufficient to override the finding of felonious intent needed for conviction. This is totally without merit. Appellants ignore the evidence that at the time of their apprehension they were already carrying a five-gallon container filled with water. Without appellants\u2019 explanation the evidence was sufficient to convict; with the explanation the trier of fact had a right to disbelieve and so convict. <em>Brown v. State, </em>39 Md. App. 497, 506 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-8\">Regarding the rogue and vagabond convictions, appellants likewise assert that the State failed to prove the requisite intent. This argument is specious. The evidence which supported the intent for the breaking also amply supported the intent for the rogue and vagabond convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-9\">Appellants next assert a failure by the State to produce sufficient evidence to prove a willful or malicious intent to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>destroy, injure or molest property to support their convictions for malicious destruction of property. Here, appellants did break the window. They claim otherwise, but the jury chose to disbelieve their explanation and found that their intent was to break the window to steal. This evidence was sufficient to support the convictions. <em>Spears v. </em>State, 38 Md. App. 700 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">II. <em>Merger</em></p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">Appellants maintain that the offenses of malicious destruction of property and rogue and vagabond merge with the offense of breaking with intent to steal property valued over $300.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">In <em>Rose v. State, </em>37 Md. App. 388, 393-94 (1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>281 Md. 743 (1977), this Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-8\">\"While we have often refused to decide a question of merger which has not been raised or decided in the trial court in cases in which concurrent terms were imposed, we have not declined to consider such questions in cases in which consecutive terms were imposed.\u201d (Footnotes omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b677-9\">Here, the terms imposed were concurrent. Since this issue was not raised below, it is not properly before us. Maryland Rule 1085; <em>Johnson v. State, </em>38 Md. App. 306 (1977); <em>Colbert v. State, </em>18 Md. App. 632 (1973); <em>Moore v. State, </em>15 Md. App. 396 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-10\">III. <em>Waiver of Right to Counsel</em></p>\n<p id=\"b677-11\">It is well established that a defendant in a criminal prosecution has two independent constitutional rights with regard to the management of his defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-12\">The right to the assistance of counsel is guaranteed by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the federal Constitution. <em>See, e.g., Argersinger v. Hamlin, </em>407 U.S. 25 (1972); <em>Gideon v. Wainwright, </em>372 U.S. 335 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-13\">A defendant in a criminal case also has a constitutional right to proceed without counsel, so long as certain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>well-defined procedural safeguards are complied with. <em>See Faretta v. California, </em>422 U.S. 806 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">Whenever a defendant proceeds without the assistance of counsel, either because he has affirmatively waived his right to counsel or has waived his right to counsel by conduct, there must be an appropriate inquiry on the record in open court, under the procedural safeguards required by Maryland Rule 723.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">Maryland Rule 723 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-7\">\"a. <em>Appearance of Defendant.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-8\">A defendant shall appear in person at the time and place specified in the summons or other writ issued pursuant to Rule 720 (Original Summons, Warrant and Notice to Appear), unless his counsel enters an appearance for him in writing on or before the time. If the defendant fails to appear personally or by counsel, the court may direct the clerk to issue a warrant for his arrest or to reissue the summons for personal service on the defendant,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AH1\">b. <em>Appearance Without Counsel.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-9\">When a defendant appears pursuant to section a of this Rule and is not represented by counsel, the court shall:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-10\">1. Make certain that the defendant has received or receives a copy of the charging document;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-11\">2. Advise the defendant that he has a right to be represented by counsel at every stage of the proceedings;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-12\">3. Advise the defendant of the matters required by subsections 1, 2 and 3 of section c of this Rule;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-13\">4. Advise the defendant who desires counsel that he must retain the services of counsel and have counsel enter an appearance for him within 15 days;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-14\">5. Advise the defendant that if he finds he is financially unable to retain the service of private counsel, he should apply to the Public Defender as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>soon as possible for a determination of his eligibility to have counsel provided for him by the Public Defender;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-6\">6. Advise the defendant that if the Public Defender declines to provide representation, the defendant should immediately notify the clerk of the court so that the court can determine whether it should appoint counsel pursuant to Article 27A, section 6 (f), of the Maryland Code;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-7\">7. Advise the defendant that if counsel does not enter an appearance within 15 days, a plea of not guilty will be entered pursuant to section b 3 of Rule 731 (Pleas), and the defendant\u2019s case will be scheduled for trial. The court shall also advise the defendant that if he appears for trial without counsel, the court could determine that he has waived his right to counsel by neglecting or refusing to retain counsel or to make timely application to the Public Defender for counsel, and in that event, the case would proceed with defendant unrepresented by counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-8\">c. <em>Waiver Inquiry.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-9\">When a defendant indicates a desire or inclination to waive counsel, the court may not accept the waiver until it determines, after appropriate questioning on the record in open court, that the defendant possesses the intelligence and capacity to appreciate the consequences of his decision, and fully comprehends:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-10\">1. The nature of the charges against him, any lesser included offenses, and the range of allowable penalties, including mandatory and minimum penalties, if any;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-11\">2. That counsel can render important assistance to him in determining whether there may be defenses to the charges or circumstances in mitigation thereof, and in preparing for and representing him at trial;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>3. That even if the defendant intends to plead guilty, counsel may be of substantial assistance in developing and presenting information which could affect the sentence or other disposition;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-5\">4. That if the defendant is found to be financially unable to retain private counsel, the Public Defender or the court would, if the defendant wishes, provide counsel to represent him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-6\">d. <em>Procedure After Waiver Inquiry.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-7\">1. If the court accepts the waiver of counsel pursuant to section c of this Rule, it shall direct that a trial date be scheduled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-8\">2. If the defendant appears in court without counsel, at any proceeding after his appearance pursuant to section a of this Rule, the court may not proceed before determining whether the defendant at that time desires to waive counsel, or has waived counsel, either affirmatively or by neglecting or refusing to obtain counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-9\">e. <em>Record of Compliance.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-10\">The advice of the court given pursuant to sections b and c of this Rule and the finding that the defendant waived counsel pursuant to sections c and d of this Rule shall be made on the record in open court. The docket entries shall affirmatively show compliance with this Rule.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b680-12\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>appellants appeared at their arraignment on October 11,1979, without counsel and were properly advised at that time of their rights under section b of Rule 723. Sometime after their arraignment, the public defender entered his appearance on behalf of the appellants and the case was set for trial on February 21, 1980. On the day of trial, appellant Brown indicated to the court that he did not wish to proceed with trial in the absence of appellant Summers.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court granted the postponement and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>rescheduled the trial for April 28,1980. Appellants appeared for trial with the Public Defender. This time a postponement was requested to allow appellants to retain private counsel. The trial court granted the postponement and cautioned the appellants:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-5\">\"THE COURT: All right, gentlemen, the case will be continued until July 9th at ten o\u2019clock in the morning. That should give you adequate time to get an attorney, and the Court is going to advise you again that you are entitled to be represented by an attorney of your choice, and you have certain rights \u2014 in other words, what I\u2019m doing is repeating what the court advised you when you appeared before Judge Everngam, that you have a right to be represented by a private lawyer, and if you can\u2019t afford a private lawyer, and it\u2019s concievable [sic] to the Court that you might not be able to raise all the funds to get a private lawyer, then you should promptly return to the public defender and reapply to the public defender.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-6\">As I have said before, an attorney can render important assistance to you in determining whether there are defenses to the charges or circumstances in mitigation thereof and preparing and representing you at the trial, and even if you decided later to plead guilty, an attorney may be of substantial assistance in the sentence or other disposition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-7\">Of course, as I have indicated before, if you still find you are financially unable to retain a private lawyer, the public defender or court would, if you desire and wish, provide an attorney to represent you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-8\">Now, if there is to be any change in your address, you must promptly notify the clerk of this court, and you go back to the public defender if you can\u2019t get a private lawyer because of financial reasons, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>and if he refuses or declines to appoint another lawyer to represent you, then you must promptly notify the clerk of this court so the court can decide whether to appoint a lawyer to represent you. Do you understand what I\u2019m saying, gentlemen?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-5\">MR. SUMMERS: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-6\">MR. BROWN: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-7\">THE COURT: This, of course, is all given in open court in the presence of the accused, and the docket entries should affirmatively show that this complies with Maryland Rule 723[a].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-8\">\n<em>I want you to fully understand that if you come into court on the next trial date or any other date for some reason or another and you don\u2019t have a private lawyer or public defender to represent you, you are going to have to be prepared to represent yourself at the trial, is that clear?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-9\">MR. BROWN: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-10\">MR. SUMMERS: Yes.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b682-11\">Appellants admit that they were advised by the court of the procedural safeguards contained in Rule 723 and the possible ramifications that could befall them under \u00a7 b (7) (by neglecting or refusing to retain counsel.)</p>\n<p id=\"b682-12\">Appellant Summers appeared before the court without counsel on July 8, 1980, and requested a postponement, which was denied. He advised the court at that time that his attorney would be present the following day for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-13\">On July 9, 1980, both appellants appeared for trial without counsel and the following colloquy took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-14\">\"THE COURT: The Court further notes that they have appeared here today without the benefit of an attorney and before we proceed the Court should make inquiry as to why they come into court today without having an attorney to represent them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-15\">Let me see what that rule is 723[d]. It provides if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>the defendant appears in court without counsel at any proceeding after his first appearance before the court, the court may not proceed before determining whether the defendant at that time desires to waive counsel or has counsel or has waived counsel either affirmatively or by neglecting or refusing to obtain an attorney.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-5\">You do appear, gentlemen, without counsel. You want to explain to the court why, particularly in light of the fact we continued the case on April 28th because you asked or said you wanted to get private counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-6\">DEFENDANT BROWN: Why I wanted private attorney, on February 17th I come to court and Mr. Summers was in custody in Baltimore City.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-7\">THE COURT: Yes, I remember that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-8\">DEFENDANT BROWN: Mr. Skipp told me wasn\u2019t enough jurors to hear the case, couldn\u2019t be, I had to give 180 days right up for me to get a postponement. He wasn\u2019t no kind of lawyer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-9\">THE COURT: You want to explain to me why you do not have an attorney with you today?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-10\">DEFENDANT BROWN: I lost my job because they found out about my record. Same reason I lost my other job.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-11\">THE COURT: When did you lose your job?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-12\">DEFENDANT BROWN: About three months \u2014 April 28th, I was working about two weeks after that. I have been looking and looking for jobs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-13\">THE COURT: Why didn\u2019t you at that point go to the public defender and ask him to appoint a lawyer to represent you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-14\">DEFENDANT BROWN: I didn\u2019t know nothing about that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-15\">THE COURT: Mr. Summers \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-16\">DEFENDANT BROWN: Mr. Brown. I did not have the number of the one here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>THE COURT: That is very difficult for the court to accept, particularly in light of the fact you were advised of your right to have a public defender. You did in fact make application to the public defender and the public defender appointed Mr. Skipp originally to represent you. You must have been a person that didn\u2019t have sufficient funds to get a lawyer or they wouldn\u2019t have appointed you one.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-5\">So, to say you don\u2019t know that you had a right to go back and ask for a public defender to appoint a lawyer because you lost your job, I just can\u2019t buy that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-6\">Is that the reason why you say now you come without a lawyer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-7\">DEFENDANT BROWN: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-8\">THE COURT: Well, I\u2019m satisfied that Mr. Brown was fully aware of his right to an attorney. The case was postponed at his request in order that he could obtain private counsel, and if he could not then financially obtain one, he could apply to the public defender for appointment of a lawyer. He didn\u2019t see fit to do that. I\u2019m satisfied that he has either affirmatively or by neglecting to obtain counsel waived his right to have counsel represent him here today.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-9\">Now, Mr. Summers, you want to explain why you don\u2019t have an attorney?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-10\">DEFENDANT SUMMERS: I\u2019ve only asked for postponement twice; one, first time mentioned for the purpose of getting private attorney.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-11\">THE COURT: That was on the day of the trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-12\">DEFENDANT SUMMERS: That\u2019s right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-13\">THE COURT: According to the docket entries that was the second trial date because the first one you didn\u2019t appear because you were apparently confined in Baltimore City Jail.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-14\">DEFENDANT SUMMERS: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-15\">Well, since the original postponement I had asked for, I had my job, like I told you, I broke my hands <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>up, this one was broke three days after my court appearance here, and it is starting to heal, now I broke this one. You saw yesterday I had a cast on. I took it off this morning, sometime this morning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-5\">THE COURT: You haven\u2019t had a job since April?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-6\">DEFENDANT SUMMERS: No. I\u2019m saying this contributes to it, that, and I\u2019ve been back and forth numerous times to the hospital with my sister \u2014 sister had a double operation, my mother is on her dying bed right now. I just haven\u2019t had a chance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-7\">I take care of four children and I\u2019m trying to keep my stepfather from having a heart attack. I\u2019m a human being, I realize, you know, I\u2019ve never asked, like yesterday I sat here all day yesterday to walk in and walk out and to come in here now in the mind I\u2019m in.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-8\">I know you have been lenient and I know you have been fair. I\u2019m not saying that. I have worked the whole time. I have worked when this charge was supposed to took place, I had a job, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-9\">THE COURT: I just wanted to know why you don\u2019t have a lawyer today?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-10\">(No response.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-11\">DEFENDANT SUMMERS: I\u2019m trying to explain to you. I worked off and on. I\u2019ve been working. Every bit of money I\u2019ve gotten it\u2019s been going in my family\u2019s mouths.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-12\">THE COURT: Well, then you might have qualified for the public defender, you did before.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-13\">DEFENDANT SUMMERS: I would rather walk in there dumbfounded with words than to have Stefan Skipp represent me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-14\">THE COURT: Well, I don\u2019t know what your problem with Stefan is, and all I know he fights very hard for his clients, often gets them off.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-15\">Well, if you weren\u2019t financially able to get one, you knew you had a right to go to the public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>defender because you have been to him before. You were qualified or he wouldn\u2019t have appointed Mr. Skipp to represent you. He apparently found you either didn\u2019t make enough money or didn\u2019t have enough assets to obtain a lawyer and he appointed one for you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-5\">DEFENDANT SUMMERS: This is way before any type of postponement was even asked.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-6\">THE COURT: On April 28th you asked for a postponement to obtain private counsel. You were granted a postponement when all the State\u2019s witnesses were here and ready to go to trial. I think we had the jury present, I\u2019m not sure about that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-7\">As far as I\u2019m concerned, he has affirmatively or neglected to obtain counsel and has waived his right to have counsel represent him on today.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b686-8\">Appellants concede that all the safeguards contained in Rule 723 were explained to them, but still maintain that there was an ineffective waiver of their right to counsel. They appear to base this contention on the fact that they never <em>affirmatively </em>chose to proceed without counsel but were forced to do so by the trial court. They overlook the fact that their conduct may be used to show a waiver.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b686-9\">To bolster their argument, appellants claim that <em>State v. </em>Renshaw, 276 Md. 259 (1975) and <em>Snead v. State, </em>286 Md. 122 (1979) are dispositive of the alleged \"ineffective waiver.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-10\">In <em>Renshaw, supra, </em>the defendant, on the day of trial, informed the court that he was dissatisfied with the counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>assigned to the case. The trial court treated the defendant\u2019s expression of dissatisfaction with assigned counsel, his request for a change of counsel and his silence <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> as a waiver of the right to counsel and an election to proceed in proper person. In sum, the Court of Appeals determined that Renshaw had not waived his right to counsel because he had not made an unequivocal choice, but merely insisted on a different lawyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">The Court of Appeals in <em>Snead, supra, </em>faced with a factual scenario similar to that of <em>Renshaw, </em>found that the trial court erred in not inquiring whether the defendant chose to waive his right to counsel after the defendant stated, \"I don\u2019t want no attorney then.\u201d The Court of Appeals stated that when a defendant indicates a desire to defend <em>pro se, </em>the court must, by appropriate inquiry, determine whether he \"truly wants to do so.\u201d It was the failure of the judge to pursue the inquiry essential to a determination of the entitlement of the right to proceed without counsel that necessitated reversal of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\"><em>Renshaw </em>and <em>Snead, supra, </em>are inapposite to the present case. In <em>Renshaw, </em>the Court of Appeals determined that the court erred in not finding a waiver, where there was no showing on the record that the defendant was competent to waive counsel, knowingly and intelligently exercised his right to waive counsel, or knew the advantages or disadvantages of self-representation. In <em>Snead, </em>the error of the trial court was in failing to inquire whether the defendant wanted to proceed <em>pro se, </em>after advising the court that he did not want an attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">Here, if the trial court had at the April 28, 1980, hearing required appellants to proceed at that time with the trial, we would be faced with a <em>Renshaw </em>or <em>Snead </em>situation. That is not the case here \u2014 the trial court granted the postponement to allow appellants to obtain other counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>We hold that under the unique circumstances of this case the appellants by their actions effectively waived their right to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">Appellants final thrust in their quest to find reversible error centers on <em>Thompson v. State, </em>284 Md. 113 (1978). In <em>Thompson, </em>the Court of Appeals at 126 said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-6\">\"The inquiry required to be made and the test to be met under \u00a7 c before the court may accept a waiver of counsel applies not only to a defendant\u2019s appearance pursuant to \u00a7 a but also <em>to any proceeding at which he appears without counsel thereafter. </em>In such event, the court is prohibited from proceeding before determining whether the defendant <em>at that time </em>desires to waive counsel or has waived counsel. \u00a7 d 2. By \u00a7 e, there must be a record of compliance with respect to \u00a7\u00a7 b, c and d.\u201d (Emphasis in original. Footnote omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b688-7\"><em>Thompson </em>concerned a defendant, who after an appeal of a District Court conviction, appeared in the Circuit Court on several occasions without counsel. There was never any compliance with Rule 723 at any of these appearances. Also, Thompson was never advised of his right to have representation by the public defender. It was for these reasons that the conviction was reversed. The quoted section from <em>Thompson </em>relied on by appellants was at most <em>dicta </em>in that case. However, we find appellants\u2019 interpretation of that quoted portion to be in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-8\">We have found, and indeed appellants concede, that all their rights under Rule 723 \u00a7\u00a7 a, b, and c had properly been given prior to the date of trial. Section d (1) applies where there has been an acceptance by the court of an affirmative waiver of counsel; here a trial date is then set. Additional safeguards are required by \u00a7 d (2). Naturally, if an affirmative waiver of counsel was accepted by the court and a trial date set pursuant to \u00a7 d (1), the defendant would appear in court on that trial date without an attorney. Under \u00a7 d (2) the trial court must ascertain that there has been a waiver; this does not require a restating of the rights under \u00a7 c. If <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>the waiver was by conduct \u2014 <em>i.e., </em>\"neglecting or refusing to obtain counsel\u201d \u2014 d (2) only requires that the trial court find that the conduct amounted to a waiver. This would not require a restating of the right under \u00a7 c. To hold otherwise would be ludicrous. If, at this stage of the proceedings, the trial court was required to restate the rights under \u00a7 c and then set a trial date, the defendant could appear the next time without counsel and the case would not proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">We hold that \u00a7 d (2) requires the trial judge to determine whether <em>at that time </em>the defendant has \"waived counsel, either affirmatively or by neglecting or refusing to obtain counsel.\u201d If all the rights required by \u00a7\u00a7 a, b, and c previously have been given, in determining that a waiver of counsel has occurred (either affirmatively or by conduct), the trial court is not mandated by \u00a7 d (2) to restate the rights under \u00a7 c on the day of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">\n<em>Appellants to pay the costs.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b675-8\">.
