Officer Williams approached appellant and, after ascertaining his identity, \"frisk[ed] his outer garments.\u201d Feeling \"a bulge in his top right pocket\u201d which \"felt like a gun handle,\u201d the officer reached into appellant\u2019s open coat and removed a handgun. After admitting that he did not have a gun permit, Johnson was arrested for a handgun violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-10\">On May 26, 1981, the case came to trial in the Criminal Court of Baltimore. A plea of not guilty was entered and, following this colloquy, which at no point indicated that appellant was aware that a jury\u2019s verdict must be unanimous, a jury trial was waived:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-11\">\"MR. DURKIN [Attorney for appellant]: At this time Your Honor I would like to advise my client on the record, Mr. Johnson you are entitled to a jury trial. A jury trial is composed of twelve men and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>women selected at random from the Voters\u2019 Registration of Baltimore City. Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-5\">MR. JOHNSON: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-6\">MR. DURKIN: Now you and I would have a chance to pass upon the jurors and impanel them and strike certain jurors out. Do you understand?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-7\">MR. JOHNSON: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-8\">MR. DURKIN: Now whether you are tried before a jury or tried before Judge Motsay alone, it would be the same standard, they must find you guilty beyond a reasonable doubt and to a moral certainty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-9\">Do you understand?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-10\">MR. JOHNSON: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-11\">MR. DURKIN: Now at this time, is it your election to waive your right to a jury trial?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-12\">MR. JOHNSON: Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b608-13\">From his subsequent conviction, which yielded a sentence of two years imprisonment, appellant appeals, raising the following issues for our determination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-14\">\"1. Were the arrest and search of Appellant conducted in violation of his Fourth Amendment rights?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-15\">2. Did the trial court err in proceeding to trial without ascertaining on the record that Appellant knowingly waived his right to trial by jury?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b608-16\">Because we find merit in appellant\u2019s second contention, we shall reverse the judgment of the court below and remand this case for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-17\">Maryland Rule TSSd,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> as interpreted by the Court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>Appeals in <em>Countess v. State, </em>286 Md. 444, 455 (1979), requires that before a case proceeds to trial before the court,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-5\">\"the defendant have a basic understanding of the nature of a jury trial. We think that this understanding is generally satisfied when the defendant entitled to a jury trial knows that he has the right to be tried by a jury of 12 persons or by the court without a jury; that whether trial is by a jury or by the court, his guilt must be found to be beyond a reasonable doubt; <em>that in a jury trial all 12 jurors must agree that he is so guilty but in a court trial the judge may so f\u00ednd.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">In point of fact, as shown from the Court\u2019s action in <em>Fairbanks v. State, </em>a companion case dealt with in <em>Countess (see </em>286 Md. at 459-61), and subsequently in <em>Hunt v. State, </em>286 Md. 541 (1979) and <em>State v. Ricketts, </em>290 Md. 287 (1981), what this means is that the record must show that the defendant was <em>told </em>these specific facts. His \"understanding\u201d of them cannot be assumed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">Accordingly, the absence from the record of any indication that appellant was told \"that in a jury trial all 12 jurors must agree\u201d before rendering a verdict compels us to reverse. As the Court held in <em>Countess, </em>\"Rule 735 means what it says, and proceeding with the trials of the cases despite the failures to comply with its provisions requires reversal of the judgments of the trial courts and entitles the defendants to be newly tried.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 463. \"[A]s long as the Rule remains unchanged, it must be followed.\u201d <em>State v. Ricketts, supra, </em>290 Md. at 293.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-8\">As the case will be remanded for new trial and it is likely that the validity of the search and seizure will again be tested, we shall, for the guidance of the trial court, address appellant\u2019s first issue. In doing so, however, we first must put it in the proper perspective.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>Appellant argues in his brief that (1) because \"the police knew absolutely nothing about either the veracity of the informant, or the basis of his knowledge that Appellant possessed a weapon . . . the informant\u2019s information was of no value\u201d in establishing probable cause for arrest and (2) since he was searched prior to his arrest, his search was not a valid search incident to arrest. That misstates the issue actually before us. Officer Williams did not immediately place appellant under arrest when he entered the restaurant. Based on the information he had received, he first conducted a \"stop and frisk\u201d \u2014 an investigative stop followed by a frisk \u2014 to see whether appellant was indeed carrying a concealed weapon, and thus might be dangerous to the officer and to other persons in the vicinity. When he discovered the \"bulge,\u201d he searched for the weapon and, after finding it, placed appellant under arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">There can be little doubt that, if the officer properly discovered that concealed weapon in appellant\u2019s possession, he had ample probable cause to effect the ultimate arrest. The real question is whether, at the time he entered the restaurant, the officer was justified in conducting the \"stop and frisk\u201d \u2014 whether the information supplied by the unknown informant coupled with his own observations gave the officer sufficient \"articulable suspicion\u201d to warrant that limited intrusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">The seminal case in that regard is <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>407 U.S. 143 (1972). There, a police officer on patrol in a high crime area was approached by a <em>known </em>informant who advised that an individual sitting in a car parked nearby had narcotics and a gun in his possession. The officer approached the car, tapped on the window, and asked the occupant (Williams) to open the door. Instead of opening the door, Williams lowered the window, whereupon the officer reached in and removed a gun from Williams\u2019 waistband \u2014 exactly where the informant told him it was. The officer then placed Williams under arrest. A subsequent search of the car produced a large amount of heroin, and Williams was convicted of possession of the gun and the heroin. The case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>reached the Supreme Court on collateral attack through Federal <em>habeas corpus </em>proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">The Court concluded that there had been no Fourth Amendment violation. Harking back to the principles enunciated in <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1 (1968), the Court confirmed that \" 'a police officer may in appropriate circumstances and in an appropriate manner approach a person for purposes of investigating possibly criminal behavior even though there is no probable cause to make an arrest\u2019 \u201d and that \" '[w]hen an officer is justified in believing that the individual whose suspicious behavior he is investigating at close range is armed and presently dangerous to the officer or to others,\u2019 he may conduct a limited protective search for concealed weapons.\u201d <em>Adams v. Williams, </em>407 U.S. at 145-46, quoting, in part, from <em>Terry, </em>392 U.S. at 22, 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">Applying those principles from <em>Terry, </em>the Court held that the officer \"acted justifiably in responding to his informant\u2019s tip.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 146. In reaching that conclusion, the Court stated (pp. 146-47):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-7\">\"The informant was known to him personally and had provided him with information in the past. This is a stronger case than obtains in the case of an anonymous telephone tip. The informant here came forward personally to give information that was immediately verifiable at the scene. Indeed, under Connecticut law, the informant might have been subject to immediate arrest for making a false complaint had Sgt. Connolly\u2019s investigation proved the tip incorrect. Thus, while the Court\u2019s decisions indicate that this informant\u2019s unverified tip may have been insufficient for a narcotics arrest or search warrant, see, e. <em>g., Spinelli </em>v. <em>United States, </em>393 U.S. 410 (1969); <em>Aguilar v. Texas, </em>378 U.S. 108 (1964), the information carried enough indicia of reliability to justify the officer\u2019s forcible stop of Williams.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-9\">In reaching this conclusion, we reject [Williams\u2019] argument that reasonable cause for a stop and frisk <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>can only be based on the officer\u2019s personal observation, rather than on information supplied by another person. Informants\u2019 tips, like all other clues and evidence coming to a policeman on the scene, may vary greatly in their value and reliability. One simple rule will not cover every situation. Some tips, completely lacking in indicia of reliability, would either warrant no police response or require further investigation before a forcible stop of a suspect would be authorized. But in some situations \u2014 for example, when the victim of a street crime seeks immediate police aid and gives a description of his assailant, or when a credible informant warns of a specific impending crime \u2014 the subtleties of the hearsay rule should not thwart an appropriate police response.\u201d (Footnote omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">The crux of the matter, then, is whether the information received by the officer has a sufficient level (indicia) of reliability to permit him to take what the Court referred to as \"an intermediate response.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 145. In making that judgment, a number of factors are considered including whether the informant was known to the officer. That particular factor is by no means determinative, however, although it was present and stressed in <em>Adams.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">The overwhelming weight of authority <em>among the </em>courts that have considered the question is that where, as here, an <em>anonymous </em>informant voluntarily approaches a law enforcement officer and gives accurate, detailed, and at least partially verifiable information concerning possible criminal activity, that information may give the officer adequate reason to stop and frisk the suspect described by the informant; and, if the officer finds sufficient evidence through the \"stop and frisk\u201d to constitute probable cause, the resulting arrest will not be held invalid. <em>See United States v. Sierra-Hernandez, </em>581 F.2d 760 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. den., </em>439 U.S. 936 (1978); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gorin, </em>564 F.2d 159 (4th Cir. 1977), <em>cert. den., </em>434 U.S. 1080 (1978); <em>People v. Tooks, </em>271 N.W.2d 503 (Mich. 1978); <em>People v. Lopez, </em>52 Cal.App.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>263 (1975); <em>United States v. Walker, </em>294 A.2d 376 (D.C. 1972), <em>appeal dismissed, </em>304 A.2d 290 (D.C.), <em>cert. den., </em>414 U.S. 1007 (1973); <em>State v. Bolden, </em>380 So.2d 40 (La.), <em>cert. den., </em>449 U.S. 856 (1980); <em>People v. Jeffries, </em>197 N.W.2d 903 (Mich.App. 1972).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">We find this line of authority, and the reasoning behind it, persuasive. Especially pertinent is the analysis used by the Michigan Supreme Court in <em>People v. Tooks, supra, </em>271 N.W.2d 503. In judging whether information supplied by a citizen-informant carries enough indicia of reliability to satisfy the <em>Terry-Adams </em>criteria, the court looked at three factors: (1) the reliability of the informant, (2) the nature of the information given to the police, and (3) the reasonableness of the officer\u2019s suspicion in the light of the other two factors. Applying those factors, the court observed first that there was \"nothing inherently unreliable about a citizen as opposed to a known informant giving information to the police,\u201d but rather that \"information provided to law enforcement officers by concerned citizens who have personally observed suspicious activities is entitled to a finding of reliability when the information is sufficiently detailed and is corroborated within a reasonable period of time by the officers\u2019 own observations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 506. To favor a known informant, who is often himself involved with or on the fringe of criminal activity, over the volunteer citizen-informant the court found to be \"illogical.\u201d We have expressed similar sentiments in the context of what it takes to establish \"probable cause\u201d under <em>Aguilar v. Texas, </em>378 U.S. 108 (1964), and <em>Spinelli v. United States, </em>393 U.S. 410 (1969). <em>See, for example, Hignut v. State, </em>17 Md.App. 399, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>410 (1973); <em>Dawson v. State, </em>14 Md.App. 18, 34 (1971) (Moylan, J., concurring); and note the comments of the Court of Appeals in <em>Watkins v. State, supra, </em>288 Md. 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">When the information supplied by the citizen-informant is specific and subject to prompt verification, not only is the second factor satisfied but it serves to enhance the informant\u2019s reliability as well, and thus add to the reasonableness of the officer\u2019s resulting suspicion.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">In such a situation, asked the court in <em>State v. Hetland, supra, </em>366 So.2d at 833, \"what is a policeman supposed to do? ... Must he ignore the information given?\u201d Along with other courts, we think not. We agree with the restatement from <em>United States v. Sierra-Hernandez, supra, </em>581 F.2d at 763, that \"Conformation from a citizen who confronts an officer in person to advise that a designated individual present on [or near] the scene is committing a specific crime should be given serious attention and great weight by the officer.\u201d As stated in <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Williams, supra, </em>407 U.S. at 145, \"[t]he Fourth Amendment does not require a policeman who lacks the precise level of information necessary for probable cause to arrest to simply shrug his shoulders and allow a crime to occur or a criminal to escape.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">Applying these concepts to the facts before us here, we believe that Officer Williams was justified in approaching appellant to investigate the information he had just received. Like the situation in <em>Adams, </em>the informant had come forward personally to report that appellant was carrying a concealed gun \u2014 an action which could have resulted in the informant\u2019s arrest for making a false complaint had subsequent investigation proved his tip to be incorrect.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The information regarding the suspect \u2014 his location and. description \u2014 was specific, based on the infor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>mant\u2019s direct observations made shortly before, and easily verifiable. When the officer went to the restaurant and saw the very person described by the informant, the totality of his information clearly sufficed to justify an investigatory stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">Although the right to proceed further with a \"frisk\u201d \"does not follow inexorably\u201d from the right to conduct an investigatory stop <em>(Gibbs v. State, </em>18 Md.App. 230, 238, <em>cert. den. </em>269 Md. 759 (1973)), the nature of the information supplied here gave Officer Williams \"reason to believe that the suspect [was] armed and dangerous.\u201d <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Williams, supra, </em>407 U.S. at 146; <em>also People v. Tooks, supra, </em>271 N.W.2d at 507. Consequently, the \"frisk\u201d was reasonable , and therefore justified, and the resulting discovery of a concealed handgun on appellant\u2019s person gave Officer Williams probable cause to place him under arrest. <em>See Adams </em>at 148.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed; case remanded to Criminal Court of Baltimore for retrial; costs shall not be reallocated pursuant to Maryland Rule 1082f.</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aeo\"><em>On Motion by the State of Maryland for Reconsideration </em>Wilner, J.: In footnote 2 on page 3 of the Slip Opinion, we noted that effective January 1,1982, Maryland Rule 735 was modified by the Court of Appeals and that, under the new Rule, the litany set forth in <em>Countess v.

Reg. 1850). Notice of the modification to Maryland Rule 735 was published in the Maryland Register of November 27,1981 (8 Md. Reg. 1928). The State made no claim in its brief that the modification effective January 1,1982, should be applied in this case; nor, despite, the notice of the modification given November 27, 1981, did it seek to have the case set for oral argument. In short, it was not until after the Opinion was filed on January 12,1982, that the State belatedly argued that the new modification should be retrospectively applied. The motion is denied.
