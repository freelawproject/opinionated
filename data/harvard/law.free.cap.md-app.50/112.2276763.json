Newburg-Rinn <em>et ux., et al. </em>against Daniel Loewenthal, etc. In the declaratory judgment action, the Circuit Court for Montgomery County (Mitchell, J.), sitting as a court of equity, by order dated December 2,1980, granted Security\u2019s motion for summary judgment and denied that of Loewenthal, finding that under the insurance policy Security had no obligation to defend Loewenthal in the suit at law. It is from this action that Loewenthal now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">The \"Declaration,\u201d filed by Newburg-Rinn against Loewenthal alleges, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-7\">\"[Loewenthal] commenced performance on or about June 26,1978. In direct contradiction to the explicit instructions of the plaintiffs\u2019 architect as to the procedure to be utilized in excavating the basement area of the Newburg-Rinn residence, [Loewenthal] bulldozed the entire center area of the basement prior to providing adequate bracing and support for the existing foundation. [Loewenthal] had completed a substantial part of the excavation, when, on July 23,1978, cracks began to appear on one side wall under which [Loewenthal] had excavated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-8\">Soon thereafter, the inadequate bracing and underpinning were pointed out to [Loewenthal] by the plaintiffs\u2019 architect, and [Loewenthal] then promised that he would correct the situation. [Loewenthal] inspected the site on July 4,1978 and again promised to correct the problem, however this was not done. In addition, [Loewenthal] had an implied contractual obligation to perform the work <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>he undertook with skill and care, as is required by one doing excavation work in the building community.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-5\">Notwithstanding [Loewenthal\u2019s] representations, and as a result of his breach of contract in failing to properly perform the excavation and underpinning work as contracted, and by failing to perform this work with skill and care, a major portion of the improvement suffered serious property damage. As a direct and proximate result of [Loewenthal\u2019s] breach, emergency repairs were required to prevent further destruction, and it was necessary to replace portions of walls, floors and other structural elements. This also necessitated plaintiffs being caused to vacate their home and to seek temporary shelter.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">As a result of Loewenthal\u2019s alleged negligent actions, the Newburg-Rinns claim damages as measured by \"(1) lost rental value of their home, (2) time differential losses in replacement costs, (3) lost wages, (4) property damage, and (5) pain, suffering and mental anguish.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">The comprehensive general liability insurance policy issued by Security to Loewenthal provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-8\">\"The company will pay on behalf of the insured all sums which the insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages because of A. <em>bodily injury or </em>B. <em>property damage </em>to which this insurance applies, caused by an occurrence, and the company shall have the right and duty to defend any suit against the insured seeking damages on account of such bodily injury or property damage, even if any of the allegations of the suit are groundless, false or fraudulent... .\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b136-9\">The hazards insured under the policy were essentially excavation, plumbing (\"gas, steam, hot water or other pipe-fitting, including house connections, shop and retail stores or display rooms\u201d), and carpentry (\"in the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>struction of detached private residences for occupancy by one or two families and private garages in connection therewith\u201d). However, under the exclusionary provision relevant to this appeal, the policy did not apply</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-5\">\"to property damages included within ... (2) the collapse hazard in connection with operations identified in this policy by a classification code number which includes the symbol 'c,\u2019 (3) the underground property damages hazard in connection with operations identified in this policy by a classification code number which includes the symbol V.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">As set out in the definitional section of the policy,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-7\">\"'collapse hazard\u2019 includes 'structural property damage\u2019 as defined herein and property damage to any other property at any time resulting therefrom. 'Structural property damage\u2019 means the collapse of or structural injury to any building or structure due to (1) grading of land, excavating, burrowing, filling, back-filling, tunnelling, pile driving, cofferdam work or caisson work or (2) moving, shoring, underpinning, raising or demolition of any building or structure or removal or rebuilding of any structural support thereof. The collapse hazard does not include property damage (1) arising out of operations performed for the named insured by independent contractors, or (2) included within the completed operations hazard or the underground property damage hazard, or (3) for which liability is assumed by the insured under an incidental contract:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-8\">'[Underground property damage hazard\u2019 includes underground property damage as defined herein and property damage to any other property at any time resulting therefrom. 'Underground property damage\u2019 means property damage to wires, conduits, pipes, mains, sewers, tanks, tunnels, any similar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>property, and any apparatus in connection therewith, beneath the surface of the ground or water, caused by and occurring during the use of mechanical equipment for the purpose of grading land, paving, excavating, drilling, burrowing, filling, back-filling or pile driving. The underground property damage hazard does not include property damage (1) arising out of operations performed for the named insured by independent contractors, or (2) included within the completed operations hazard, or (3) for which liability is assumed by the insured under an incidental contract.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">Although Loewenthal paid a premium to eliminate the underground property damage hazard exclusion, there is no question that Loewenthal did not purchase the collapse hazard coverage. Subject to the collapse hazard exclusion were the operational hazards \"Excavation 15111 x c\u201d and \"Underpinning Buildings or Structures \u2014 including incidental shoring, removal or rebuilding of walls, foundations, columns or piers ... 17885 sxc.\u201d Damages arising from excavation or underpinning operations would be covered by the policy if they fell within the underground property damage hazard, but excluded from policy coverage if within the collapse hazard exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">Loewenthal argues that the policy provides coverage or an obligation to defend for the damage to the Newburg-Rinns for any one of four reasons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-7\">(1) the collapse hazard exclusion is inapplicable and/or unenforceable;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-8\">(2) the occurrence is potentially covered by the underground property damage provision;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-9\">(3) there is a potentiality of coverage under the basic policy provisions, notwithstanding the above two exclusions;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-10\">(4) if the collapse hazard exclusion applies, Security is obligated to provide a defense because of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>the plaintiffs\u2019 allegations of personal injuries, which are clearly not excluded from coverage under the collapse hazard exclusion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">Turning first to the procedural posture of this case, Maryland Rule 610 provides that a motion for summary judgment shall be granted if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, admissions on file, and affidavits show that there are no genuine issues as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">Although a summary judgment in a declaratory judgment action is the exception rather than the rule, circumstances may warrant the entry of a full or partial summary judgment. <em>See Pennsylvania Nat. Mut. v. Gartelman, </em>288 Md. 151 (1980); <em>National Grange Mut. Ins. v. Pinkney, </em>284 Md. 694 (1979). As the Court of Appeals stated in <em>Dart Drug Corp. v. Hechinger Co., </em>272 Md. 15, 29 (1974), \"[w]hile a declaratory decree need not be in any particular form, it must pass upon and adjudicate the issues raised in the proceeding, to the end that the rights of the parties are clearly delineated and the controversy terminated ... .\u201d The issues presented warrant a summary disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">On the issues properly before us, there is no factual dispute disclosed by the pleadings and affidavits. Rather, the parties disagree on what label should be attached to the facts. There being no dispute as to fact, Security\u2019s liability under the policy turns on the construction of the policy exclusions; this presents a question of law for the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">The applicable law is set forth in Appleman, <em>Insurance Law and Practice </em>(Berdal ed.) \u00a7 4683, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-9\">\"An insurer\u2019s duty to defend an action against the insured is measured by the allegations in the plaintiff\u2019s pleadings, and if such pleadings state facts bringing the injury within the coverage of the policy, the insurer must defend, irrespective of the insured\u2019s ultimate liability to. the plaintiff.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b139-10\"><em>See also Brohawn v. Transamerica Ins. Co., </em>276 Md. 396, 407 (1975), and numerous authorities cited therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>Furthermore, where the complaint does not state facts sufficient to clearly bring the case within or without coverage, the general rule, followed in Maryland, is that the insurer is obligated to defend if there is potentially a case within policy coverage. <em>Brohawn, supra, </em>at 408-409; <em>U.S.F.&amp;G. v. Nat\u2019l Pav. Co., </em>228 Md. 40, 54-55 (1962); Annot., 50 A.L.R.2d 458 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">\n<em>Collapse Hazard Exclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">Loewenthal does not agree with Security\u2019s reading of the policy that no coverage can be provided for \"collapse of or structural injury to any building or structure due to (1) ... excavating ... or (2) ... shoring [or] underpinning ... any building or structure . . .\u201d (collapse hazard definition),\u201d in view of the fact that Loewenthal specifically was purchasing insurance for excavation hazards.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">Loewenthal first argues, quoting <em>D\u2019Agostino Excavators, Inc. v. Globe Indemnity Co., </em>184 N.Y.S.2d 378 (1959), that \"the [collapse hazard] exclusion cancels out the purported [excavation] coverage, a result that could not have been contemplated by the parties.\u201d In Loewenthal\u2019s eyes, although the policy purports to cover him for property damages and personal injuries caused by and during excavation activities, the collapse hazard provision, which excludes coverage for property damages if there is \"collapse of or structural injury to any building or structure,\u201d would preclude coverage for damage to buildings and \"anything constructed, [such as] water pipes, electrical conduits, sewers .. . .\u201d In effect, the exclusion \"would deny to Loewenthal any coverage for any damages due to excavation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">We do not, however, agree with Loewenthal\u2019s definition of \"structural property damage,\u201d or his conclusion that the policy coverage is meaningless in light of the exclusions.\u201d Pipes and sewers are not included within \"structural property damage.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>It is only such structural property damage resulting from excavation procedures which is excluded from coverage under the collapse hazard provision. As appellee points out in its brief and in argument to the trial judge, other types of damages resulting from excavation operations would be covered regardless of the collapse hazard exclusion, including structural damages resulting from the insured\u2019s actions where the initial damage was not structural property damage, as well as personal injuries. For example, appellee submits the policy would provide coverage for:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-5\">\"(1) a supporting brace falling over and injuring the owner of a residence,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-6\">(2) a bulldozer accidentally hitting and damaging a motor vehicle, shrubbery ... animals ...,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-7\">(3) a backhoe accidentally crushing a plumbing fixture, tearing out wiring, or causing damage to other non-structural elements; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-8\">(4) an antique clock accidentally broken by an employee while digging a hole for a drainage pipe.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-9\">We cannot agree with appellant\u2019s contention that the collapse hazard exclusion is unenforceable because of overbreadth. The collapse hazard exclusion limits but does not render meaningless the coverage generally afforded excavation operations in the \"description of hazards\u201d portion of the policy.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b141-10\">Loewenthal next argues, without going into any specifics, that the occurrence at issue does not fall within the collapse hazard exclusion. He merely argues the broad concept of \"potentiality.\u201d Under that concept, \"[e]ven if a tort plaintiff does not allege facts which clearly bring the claim within or without the policy coverage, the insurer still must defend if there is a <em>potentiality </em>that the claim could be covered by the policy.\u201d <em>Brohawn, supra, </em>at 408, citing <em>U.S.F.&amp;G. v. Nat'l </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number><em>Pav. Co., supra, </em>at 54. Loewenthal attempts to find a \"potentiality\u201d of coverage and thus an obligation to defend in what it terms ambiguities and uncertainties in the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">It seems quite clear to us that the occurrence fits squarely within the collapse hazard exclusion for which no protection was purchased. As described in the plaintiffs\u2019 declaration, appellant contracted \"to perform ... excavation work in accordance with the plans of the plaintiffs\u2019 architect, and ... in addition ... underpinning of the foundation and shoring and reenforcing of the foundation, while the foundation was underway.\u201d Appellant \"bulldozed the entire center area of the basement prior to providing adequate bracing and support for the existing foundation\u201d and thereafter \"cracks began to appear on one side wall under which [appellant] had excavated.\u201d The damage alleged is clearly structural injury <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to a building due to alleged negligence in excavating or shoring or underpinning the building. See policy definition of \"collapse hazard.\u201d As such, the structural damage resulting from appellant\u2019s activities is excluded from coverage under the collapse hazard exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">\n<em>Underground Property Damage Hazard</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">Appellant next argues that appellee is obligated to defend because of a potentiality of coverage under the underground property damage hazard provision, an exclusionary provision of the policy which had been purchased by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">The applicability of the underground property damage hazard provision was not timely raised by appellant\u2019s counsel. The briefs and arguments on the motions for summary judgment raised as the sole issue the interpretation and enforceability of the collapse hazard exclusion. No mention of the coverage provided by the underground property dam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>age hazard provision was made by appellant until motion to reconsider the court\u2019s rulings on the cross-motions for summary judgment. On the motion to reconsider, appellant\u2019s counsel proffered to the trial judge that \"the underground property damage hazard wasn\u2019t argued ... on the prior hearing.\u201d The trial judge, without more, said: \"Very well, Motion is denied.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">This Court has stated, in <em>Angell v. Just, </em>22 Md. App. 43, 47 (1974):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-6\">\"It is well settled in Maryland that the grant or refusal of a rehearing lies within the sound discretion of the trial court. The action of the trial court upon such motion will not be disturbed on appeal except under the most compelling and extraordinary circumstances.\u201d (Citations omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">There are no such circumstances to recommend a reconsideration here. Appellant does not allege that new facts came to light since the motions were first ruled on. To the contrary, the fact that there might have been initial damage to water pipes, such as would put the occurrence within the underground property damage hazard coverage, was set out in appellant\u2019s affidavit filed with his motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">\n<em>Personal Injury Allegations</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b143-9\">Although appellant\u2019s third contention is totally without merit,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> we find his fourth persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-10\">Appellant argues that appellee is obligated to defend him because of the Newburg-Rinns\u2019 allegation of personal injuries, loss of wages and rental income in that the insurer promised to pay for bodily injury and property damage due to covered occurrences while the collapse hazard exclusion precluded coverage only for property damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>Although the appellee concedes the point that if there were bodily injuries it would be obligated to defend, it argues that damages for mental anguish as alleged by the Newburg-Rinns will not be awarded where there is not physical injury as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">It is another general principle of insurance law that the duty to defend encompasses even frivolous and unfounded allegations if, as in the case at bar, a policy clause so provides. Because of the appellee\u2019s agreement to defend any suit against the insured seeking damages \"even if any of the allegations of the suit are groundless, false or fraudulent,\u201d there is a duty to defend any claim whenever it is potentially within the policy and even though the claim has no basis in fact. As interpreted by Chief Judge Learned Hand in <em>Lee v. Aetna Casualty and Surety Co., </em>178 F.2d 750, 751-752 (2d Cir. 1949, and quoted by the Court of Appeals of Maryland in <em>Brohawn, supra, </em>at 410, the insurer\u2019s promise to defend even groundless allegations means that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-6\">\" 'the insurer will defend the suit, if the injured party states a claim, which, qua claim, is for an injury \"covered\u201d by the policy; it is the claim which determines the insurer\u2019s duty to defend; and it is irrelevant that the insurer may get information from the insured, or from anyone else, which indicates, or even demonstrates, that the injury is not in fact \"covered.\u201d The insurer has promised to relieve the insured of the burden of satisfying the tribunal where the suit is tried, that the claim as pleaded is \"groundless.\u201d \u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">The Court in <em>Brohawn, </em>continued, at 409-410:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-8\">\"Although the type of policy here considered is most often referred to as liability insurance, it is 'litigation insurance\u2019 as well, protecting the insured from the expense of defending suits brought against him. By clear and unequivocal language, [appellee] has assumed the obligation of relieving its insured of the expense of defending an action alleging and seeking damages within the policy coverage. Addi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>tionally, the insured could reasonably expect that the insurer will employ its vast legal and investigative resources to defeat the action for the mutual benefit of both the insurer and the insured.\u201d (Citation omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b145-3\">Although appellant is not correct in his contention that the appellee is obligated to defend the entire suit,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> appellee is</p>\n<p id=\"A9D\">obligated to defend that portion of the claim which related to bodily injuries. \"Bodily injury,\u201d defined in the policy as \"bodily injury, sickness or disease sustained by any person . . . including death at any time resulting therefrom,\u201d encompasses the claim of pain, suffering, and mental anguish.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">For these reasons, summary judgment should have been entered in favor of appellant with respect to appellee\u2019s obligation to provide a defense to the plaintiffs\u2019 claims of pain, suffering, and mental anguish.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">\n<em>Judgment vacated; case remanded for entry of summary judgment and of a declaration in conformity with this opinion; costs to be paid by appellee.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b140-9\">. This is evident from the insurance policy\u2019s definitions of \u201cunderground property damage\u201d and \"structural property damage.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b141-11\">. It is also important to note in this regard that the insurance policy, which listed the appellant\u2019s business as \"Home Improvement Contractor,\u201d provided coverage for plumbing and carpentry hazards as well.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b142-9\">. It matters not, as appellant contends, that there was not a sudden and basic change in the character of the structure so as to be a \"collapse.\u201d as defined in other jurisdictions. <em>See </em>Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity Co. v. Crider, 392 F. Supp. 162, 169 (Ill. 1974). As explicitly defined in the insurance policy, the structural property damage excluded from coverage under the collapse hazard exclusion includes structural injury to as well as collapse of any building or structure.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b143-11\">. <em>See </em>(3) <em>supra, </em>page 116.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b145-6\">. Although many courts which have addressed the issue have not permitted apportionment of defense costs between the insurer and the insured, <em>see, e.g., </em>Tampa Elec. Co. v. Stone &amp; Webster Engineering Corp., 367 F.Supp. 27 (M.D.Fla., 1973); Home Ins. Co. v. Pinski Bros., Inc., 500 P.2d 945 (Mont., 1972); St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co. v. Hodor, 200 So.2d 205 (Fla. App. 1967), the rationale behind these authorities is that an insurer must bear the entire cost of defense only when there is no reasonable means of prorating the costs of defense between excluded and uncovered items. <em>See </em>National Steel Const. Co. v. National U. Fire Ins. Co., 543 P.2d 642 (Wash. App. 1975). Such a consideration is not the case here since defense costs can be readily apportioned.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
