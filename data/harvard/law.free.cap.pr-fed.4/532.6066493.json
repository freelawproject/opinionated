In the case of Barbosa v. Bird, 1 Porto Rico Fed. Rep. 19, that question was settled.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">Therefore, no fee will be allowed save in accordance with some law of the United States, and the application in this case for any other or different fee wil be denied. An order to that effect will be entered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
