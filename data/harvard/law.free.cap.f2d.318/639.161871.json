When the government closed its case in appellant\u2019s trial for violation of the Dyer Act (18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2312), appellant\u2019s retained counsel announced that appellant would not take the stand. Out of the presence of the jury, the court then told appellant that he did not have to take the stand but, in effect, advised appellant to waive his privilege and testify.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellant did so.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-21\">On cross-examination appellant was compelled to testify that he had been convicted of two felonies, including a prior violation of the Dyer Act. Appellant had mistakenly supposed that he could not be questioned regarding his prior record. He was so disconcerted when advised to the contrary that he volunteered, in the presence of the jury, that in his own opinion his compelled testimony as to his prior offenses \u201ccer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>tainly helps to prove\u201d that he committed the offense charged.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">We do not question the broad power of the trial court to take affirmative action to protect the rights of the accused in a federal criminal trial. See Glasser v. United States, 315 U.S. 60, 71, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942). However, when the court undertakes to give a defendant specific advice as to the conduct of his defense, the court is first bound to assure itself that it is in possession of the facts necessary to formulate advice which is sound, and that the defendant has sufficient knowledge of the relevant considerations to act intelligently in accepting or rejecting the proffered counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">Here the court was apparently unaware of appellant\u2019s prior record (a factor of no small importance in forming a sound judgment as to whether it was in appellant\u2019s interest to testify), and appellant was unaware of the fact that he could be questioned regarding his prior convictions. Thus, because the court failed to properly inform either itself or appellant, advice on a matter vital to appellant was offered and accepted in ignorance of facts essential to intelligent judgment by either.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-23\">The court therefore erred, and the error was prejudicial. The court\u2019s advice, being uninformed, was as likely to be bad as good, and appellant\u2019s uninformed decision to accept it could be no better.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-24\">2. Appellant also contends that the court\u2019s instructions permitted the jury to convict even if it concluded that appellant had not formed an intent to steal the rented car until after the interstate journey had ended.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-25\">The statute requires that the vehicle be transported in interstate commerce with knowledge that it has been stolen. See Sadler v. United States, 303 F.2d 664, 665 (10th Cir. 1962); Evans v. United States, 240 F.2d 695, 696 (10th Cir. 1957). We have no doubt that the trial court will avoid any possible ambiguity on this score in framing its instructions at the new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-26\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b688-10\">. The record reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-11\">\u201cDEFENSE COUNSEL: The defendant, acting within his constitutional rights, declines to appear as a witness in his own behalf, and the defense has no further witnesses so we rest our case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-12\">\u201cTHE COURT: So there won\u2019t be any mistake, I would like to discuss this matter with counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-13\">(Thereupon, the following proceedings were then had out of the presence of the jury and with the defendant present together with his counsel:)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-14\">\u201cTHE COURT: I want to tell you you do not have to take the stand if you do not want to. But I want to tell you this, that I think you are in a very difficult position if you do not take the stand. You indicated to me earlier today that you were concerned about this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-15\">\u201cDEFENDANT RICHARDS: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-17\">\u201cTHE COURT: You thought that you were being railroaded to jail. If these witnesses have given false testimony, I think you may want to deny the statements because this way you are letting the statements of the officers go unchallenged.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-18\">\u201cI do not ordinarily do this, but in view of the conversation that we had today and in view of your concern that your constitutional rights might not be protected and my statements to you that I would not rely solely on what the jury would do. If I came to the conclusion that you are not guilty of the charge made in the indictment, even though the jury might find you guilty, I would certainly see to it that the judgment and verdict were set aside or other disposition made. Your election to rely on the fifth amendment is a proper one and you can do that. But if I were the one who was making a determination of the facts, I could only do one thing and that is find you guilty, and I fear the jury is going to do the same thing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-23\">\u201cNow, I do not tell you what to do. I know that some very damaging testimony came out about your use of other names and other things. I don\u2019t know what other information would come out as to why you loft Corpus Christi, but you must make the determination yourself. But I didn\u2019t want Mr. Stewart to waive for you. I didn\u2019t want him to waive without talking to you and telling you precisely what you were up against.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-25\">\u201cDEFENSE COUNSEL: Yes, your Honor, I would like to have the records show, and I have pointed out to the defendant exactly wliat you have told him, and I would like the record to show that the defendant answers in his own words.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-27\">\u201cDEFENDANT RICHARDS: I will take the stand then.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-29\">\u201cDEFENSE COUNSEL: Are you changing your mind then?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-31\">\u201cDEFENDANT RICHARDS: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-32\">\u201cDEFENSE COUNSEL: Fine. That is your privilege.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b689-7\">. This portion of the cross-examination was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-8\">\u201cQ * * * Have you ever been convicted of a felony, Mr. Richards?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-10\">\u201cA I refuse to answer that on the ground it could tend to incriminate me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-11\">\u201cTHE COURT: That does not incriminate you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-12\">\u201cTHE WITNESS: I beg your pardon?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-14\">\u201cTHE COURT: That does not incriminate you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-16\">\u201cTHE WITNESS: Well, I don\u2019t know these things.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-17\">\u201cTHE COURT: No, that is a question that he can properly ask you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-18\">\u201cTHE WITNESS: Well, I was under the impression that they couldn\u2019t ask me questions like that. I am not on trial for that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-19\">\u201cTHE COURT: You are not on trial for that, but once you take the stand, then all of the matters of your background are legitimate questions, and the question of your conviction of a felony goes to your credibility. That is the only purpose for which it is to be used.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-20\">\u201cFor example, the fact that you were convicted of a crime five years ago or two years ago or one year ago is not going to prove that you committed tlie offense charged in the indictment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-28\">\u201cTHE WITNESS: It certainly helps to prove it, I think \u2014 I\u2019m sorry, I am out of line. I didn\u2019t mean to say that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-30\">\u201cTIIE COURT: Do you have certified copies ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-31\">\u201cPROSECUTOR: I have the F.B.I. sheet. To show good faith, your Honor, I would like the opportunity of requiring defendant\u2019s examination on this matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-34\">\u201cTHE COURT: You cannot do that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-35\">\u201cWill you answer the question: Were you convicted of a felony?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-36\">\u201cTHE WITNESS: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-37\">\u201cPROSECUTOR: Q And what for?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-38\">\u201cA For the Dyer Act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-39\">\u201cQ Were you ever convicted of any other felony?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-40\">\u201cA Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-41\">\u201cQ What for?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-42\">\u201cA I was convicted for prison breach.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-43\">\u201cTHE COURT: I think you have gone into that enough now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-44\">\u201cPROSECUTOR: I have nothing further, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-45\">\u201cDEFENSE COUNSEL: No further questions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-47\">\u201cTHE COURT: That is all.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
