Hawley, New York City, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b377-14\">Before WORLEY, Chief Judge, and RICH, MARTIN, SMITH, and ALMOND, Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b377-15\">ALMOND, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"b377-16\">Appellant, Shunk Manufacturing Company, filed a trademark application<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to register a figure, designated as a Scotsman, as a trademark for heavy duty equipment, such as graders and other ground working machines, blades therefor, sand spreaders, etc. The trademark sought to be registered is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b377-23\">Use beginning in or about September 1957 is asserted.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-24\">Appellee, Tarrant Manufacturing Company, registrant of \u201cSCOTCHMAN\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for motor driven mechanical apparatus for spreading flake, chip, and granular material on highways, land, and water, filed notice of opposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-25\">Appellee\u2019s word mark is illustrated as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b377-27\">The grounds of appellee\u2019s opposition, as alleged, were, in material substance, that it is engaged in the manufacture and selling of equipment for maintenance work on streets and highways; that it has used the trademark <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>\"SCOTCHMAN\u201d on its equipment long prior to the year 1957; that appellant\u2019s caricature of a Scotsman would be generally viewed as the equivalent of appellee\u2019s word mark; that the goods \u201csand spreaders\u201d are substantially identical with appellee\u2019s goods, and are sold through the same channels of trade to the same customers; that for many years prior to 1957 appellee had used a picture of a Scotchman in conjunction with its word mark in its advertising literature of the \u201cSCOTCHMAN\u201d spreader and that the figure or picture had been associated in the minds of the purchasing public with the spreader as identifying appellee\u2019s goods and that in view of the close association of the Scotch figure with the name \u201cSCOTCHMAN,\u201d the use by appellant of its figure would be likely to cause confusion, mistake and deception of purchasers as to the origin of the goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">Both parties took testimony relating to the use of the respective marks through the process of advertisement, the application to their products and the class of purchasers to whom they supplied the goods advertised and sold. Appellant\u2019s witnesses testified that no actual confusion of purchasers had ever been brought to their attention.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">There is no issue of priority. Appellee\u2019s prior use of its mark is apparently conceded.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">The sole issue is whether or not appellant\u2019s mark so resembles appellee\u2019s mark \u201cSCOTCHMAN\u201d as to be likely to cause confusion etc. when these marks are applied to the respective products of the parties. 15 U.S.C. 1052(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">We have carefully examined the record in the light of the findings of the board. The board found that appellee manufactures and sells equipment for highway and street construction and maintenance and that since 1947 it has used the mark \u201cSCOTCHMAN\u201d on a mechanism, mounted on a dump truck, which spreads rock salt on highways for ice control thereon. The board further found that appellee had, since 1948, continuously used in conjunction with its mark a picture representation of a Scotchman, sometimes identified as \u201cTarco MacTavish,\u201d in various advertising material distributed to the trade.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-9\">The board also found that the appellant was engaged primarily in the manufacture and sale of blades or cutting edges for earth moving equipment; that in 1955 it adopted and began using in advertisements the Scotsman figure which it seeks to register; that this figure was occasionally identified in advertising material as \u201cSandy McShunk\u201d; that in 1957 appellants began applying the mark to a hopper-type spreader for salt, sand, and cinders and that the spreader can be either mounted on a dump truck or made a composite part of the truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-10\">In our judgment, the record fairly supports the factual findings of the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-11\">The products here involved to which the respective marks of the parties are applied are spreaders designed and used to spread material on highways. The fact that one is mounted on the tailgate of a truck and the other attached to the frame at the rear of the truck and that they are not in the same price class does not materially affect their similarity of character and function.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-12\">Appellant contends that the board was in error in not considering each and every item of merchandise listed in its application for registration.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-13\">The record discloses that the marks of the parties are used on spreaders, thus pointing up not only identity of product but also identity of purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-14\">On reconsideration, the board properly held that where there is likelihood of confusion as to any of the goods listed in the application, it is not necessary to rule on other goods listed therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-15\">The essence of the matter before us is that appellee\u2019s mark \u201cSCOTCHMAN\u201d has been extensively advertised and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>known to the purchasing public as well as used as a trademark for spreaders since 1947. The figure, identified as \u201cTarco MacTavish,\u201d representative of a Scotchman, has been widely disseminated through advertising media to promote sales continuously since 1948.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">Appellant adduced testimony relating to the conception of its figure, identified in its advertising material as Sandy Mc-Shunk, laying especial emphasis on distinguishing characteristics as related to \u201cTarco MacTavish.\u201d While perceptible differences in sharpness of lines, facial expression and dress are manifest, nevertheless, both figures portray Scotchmen wearing kilts and tarn, both have the same connotation; both were designed and are used to identify the manufacturers of closely related products for a similar use, and by the same class of purchasers.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">It may well be conceded that the public or semi-public officials representing governmental entities belong to the category of discriminating buyers, as asserted by appellant, yet, in view of the closely related similarities and connotations hereinabove noted, augmented by the undisputed fact that the purchasers of appellee\u2019s products were familiar with the word mark \u201cSCOTCHMAN\u201d since 1947 and the figure in association therewith since 1948, we are inclined to the view that the marks under consideration do not present that distinction in appearance and meaning sufficient to obviate the likelihood that purchasers of the class here disclosed would be confused or deceived into believing that the goods emanated from the same source.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">Appellant points out the testimony of record supporting the absence of confusion in the concurrent use of the respective marks. It is well settled that where marks have been concurrently used for a considerable time without any evidence of confusion, such fact is not conclusive on the issue of <em>likelihood </em>of confusion but is a factor which may. properly be accorded some weight in determining the issue presented. Smith v. Tobacco By-Products &amp; Chemical Corporation, 243 F.2d 188, 44 CCPA 880.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-9\">We have before us, in opposing array, a picture and a word used in conjunction with a picture. Both have the same meaning, viz.: a Scotchman and all that the term implies. In Pink Lady Corporation v. L. N. Renault &amp; Sons, Inc., 265 F.2d 951, 46 CCPA 865, this court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A10O\">\u201c* * * It is well settled that words and the symbols identified thereby will be given the same significance in determining the likelihood of confusion between two marks. Weyenberg Shoe Manufacturing Co. v. Hood Rubber Co., 49 F.2d 1046, 18 CCPA 1449; In re Maclin-Zimmer-McGill Tobacco Co., Inc., 49 App.D.C. 181, 262 F. 635. See also In re Riverbank Canning Company, 95 F.2d 327, 25 CCPA 1028, 1030, and cases there cited.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AS4\">Appellant contends that \u201cScotch\u201d marks are \u201cinherently \u2018weak\u2019 marks and consumers of all classes are quite accustomed to distinguishing between them.\u201d In this connection we are constrained to agree with the statement of the board that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-11\">\u201cSince it is held that the marks are legal equivalents and are for use on substantially identical g'oods, it becomes unnecessary to discuss with any particularity applicant\u2019s further contentions that opposer\u2019s \u2018SCOTCHMAN\u2019 is a \u2018weak mark,\u2019 entitled to a limited scope of protection * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-12\">We have examined the cases cited by appellant. We do not find them persuasive in our resolution of the issue before us. As this court has often said, prior decisions in trademark cases afford meager assistance in our determination of issues subsequently arising. Each case must be decided on its own distinctive facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-13\">Holding that confusion of purchasers would be likely to occur, we affirm the decision of the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-14\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b377-17\">.
