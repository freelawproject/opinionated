Under the circumstances of this case we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>think that the mechanic\u2019s liens are not entitled to priority over the Government\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-5\">The facts are undisputed. Since these are set forth in meticulous detail in the District Court\u2019s opinion, 206 F.Supp. 878, only those which are pertinent to this appeal will be repeated here.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-6\">In August of 1959, Foodco Realty, Inc., a newly-organized corporate owner of land situated in Campbell County, Virginia, sought a construction loan of $85,-000 from the Campbell County Bank in order to finance plant and warehouse improvements. The bank was unwilling to enter into the transaction by itself and called in the Small Business Administration, an agency of the United States vested with broad power to join private lenders in making loans to small business concerns otherwise unable to obtain necessary funds for capital improvements.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The SBA formally agreed to put up 90% of the loan, the maximum percentage authorized by Congress, and the bank assumed the balance. Foodco promptly executed a note which, though payable to the bank alone, on its face disclosed participation by the SBA. The note was secured by a deed of trust on Foodco\u2019s property, which was recorded on August 13, 1959. Construction began eight days later but by the time the work was finally completed the following April, Foodco was insolvent in the sense that its debts exceeded its assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-9\">Appellants, who had furnished labor and materials, filed proper mechanic\u2019s liens within the sixty-day period required by Code of Va. \u00a7 43-4. On November 10, 1960, one of the appellants, W. T. Jones and Company, initiated proceedings in the Circuit Court of Campbell County to enforce its mechanic\u2019s lien. While the suit was pending, several judgments were entered against Foodco in favor of other, non-lien creditors, all of which remain unsatisfied. Meanwhile the bank assigned to the United States its 10% fractional interest in the note secured by the deed of trust in consideration for a promise by the United States to turn over 10% of any recovery upon the note. Thereupon the United States, on its motion, was permitted to intervene as a party defendant in the state lien enforcement action and to remove it to the United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia. That court in turn referred the case to a special master.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-10\">The master found that the deed of trust securing the SBA\u2019s interest in the loan was prior in time to appellants\u2019 mechanic\u2019s liens and therefore entitled to priority to the extent that it encumbered Foodco\u2019s property as it existed before the improvements were added by the mechanics.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, the master was also of the opinion that since the SBA was claiming under a Virginia deed of trust which incorporated by reference <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>certain provisions of state law<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and which secured a loan to be applied exclusively to building improvements, the SBA\u2019s claim to preference would be governed by the Virginia mechanic\u2019s lien priority statute.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> By operation of this statute the SBA would take a first lien on the land but only a second lien, inferior to that of the mechanics, on the buildings.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thus the master accorded priority to the appellants to the extent of the value of the structural improvements placed by them upon the debtor\u2019s property after recordation of the deed of trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-4\">On objections filed by the United States, the District Court reviewed and overruled the special master\u2019s report. The court did not question the master\u2019s interpretation of the Virginia lien priority statute <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> but held that \u201cfederal common law,\u201d by which \u201cthe first in time is the first in right,\u201d prevails over state law in matters affecting the priority of claims of the United States; therefore, the claim of the SBA having originated first in point of time, enforcement of the mechanic\u2019s liens would be postponed, notwithstanding their preferred status under Virginia law, until the entire unpaid balance of the loan had been satisfied out of the debtor\u2019s assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-13\">The court also ruled in the alternative that even if \u201cfederal common law\u201d was inapplicable, the debt owing to the United States would be in any event paramount to the mechanic\u2019s liens by virtue of the federal insolvency statute,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> but that on that theory the SBA\u2019s priority would not extend to the portion of the debt assigned to it by the participating bank. The court\u2019s order, however, awarded the SBA full priority on the \u201cfederal common law\u201d theory. From this order the appellant mechanics appeal.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b932-14\">I. The FEDERAL INSOLVENCY STATUTE (31 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 191)</p>\n<p id=\"b932-15\">Turning first to the federal insolvency statute, 31 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 191 (Rev.Stat. \u00a7 3466), we agree with the District Court that its provisions squarely apply to the instant case. The following language <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>is here relevant: \u201cWhenever any person indebted to the United States is insolvent * * * the debts due to the United States shall be first satisfied; and the priority established shall extend * * to cases in which an act of bankruptcy is committed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b933-5\">The manifest purpose of the statute, in force since 1797 without significant modifications,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u201cis simply to protect the interest of the Government in collecting money due to it\u201d where the property of an insolvent debtor is involved. Small Business Administration v. McClellan, 364 U.S. 446, 451-452, 81 S.Ct. 191, 195-196, 5 L.Ed.2d 200 (1960). Its command is that the United States shall be accorded an absolute priority over the claims of all general lienholders, Massachusetts v. United States, 333 U.S. 611, 625-627, 68 S.Ct. 747, 92 L.Ed. 968 (1948), even though its own lien is general and notice thereof has not been properly filed and recorded. United States v. City of New Britain, 347 U.S. 81, 84-85, 74 S.Ct. 367, 98 L.Ed. 520 (1954); United States v. Gilbert Associates, Inc., 345 U.S. 361, 366, 73 S.Ct. 701, 97 L.Ed. 1071 (1953); United States v. Texas, 314 U.S. 480, 488, 62 S.Ct. 350, 86 L.Ed. 356 (1941); United States v. Emory, 314 U.S. 423, 427-429, 62 S.Ct. 317, 86 L.Ed. 315 (1941).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> As applied to the present facts, it would seem immaterial that the deed of trust is silent as to the SBA\u2019s lien interest, inasmuch as beneficial ownership of nine-tenths of the debt so secured concededly accrued to the United States<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> immediately upon execution of the note evidencing the joint loan. Cf. Small Business Administration v. McClellan, 364 U.S. 446, 450, 81 S.Ct. 191, 5 L.Ed.2d 200 (1960); United States v. Emory, 314 U.S. 423, 430, 62 S.Ct. 317, 86 L.Ed. 315 (1941). Nor is any question raised as to the special master\u2019s express finding that Food-co is insolvent and that its insolvency arose while construction was in progress and before the mechanic\u2019s liens were filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-12\">But, as appellants correctly point out, the mere inability of the debtor to pay his debts has never been regarded as sufficient to bring the United States within the protection of section 191. See United States v. Oklahoma, 261 U.S. 253, 260, 43 S.Ct. 295, 67 L.Ed. 638 (1923), and authorities cited therein. This brings us to the question whether Foodco has committed an \u201cact of bankruptcy,\u201d as that term is defined by section 3, sub. a of the Bankruptcy Act (11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 21, sub. a). Reference thereto discloses that this requirement is satisfied by the debtor\u2019s having \u201csuffered or permitted, while insolvent, any creditor to obtain a lien upon any of his property through legal proceedings or distraint and not having vacated or discharged such lien within thirty days from the date thereof * * 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 21(a) (3). The record shows conclusively that, as early as November 29, 1960, and while insolvent, Foodco suffered a judgment against it in favor of one of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>its creditors pursuant to legal proceedings in the Circuit Court of Campbell County. This, as well as later judgments recovered by other creditors in January and May, 1961, was duly docketed and constituted a lien on its property. Code of Va. \u00a7\u00a7 8-386, 390 (1960 amend.). See Fooshee v. Snavely, 58 F.2d 772, 773 (W.D.Va.1931). Since each of these judgment liens was allowed to stand for more than thirty days, an act of bankruptcy was committed. In re Airmont Knitting &amp; Undergarment Co., Inc., 182 F.2d 740, 741 (2d Cir., 1950); United States v. Williams, 139 F.Supp. 94, 97-98 (M.D.N.C.1956); 1 Collier on Bankruptcy, \u00a7 3.301 et seq.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Consequently, section 191 must be given controlling effect and the SBA\u2019s priority upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-4\">Appellants resist this conclusion, contending that their mechanic\u2019s liens were duly perfected as a matter of state law and that section 191 does not operate against private liens which are specific and choate. The Supreme Court, however, has never actually held that specific and choate liens asserted by a private claimant are impliedly exempted from the operation of section 191. See United States v. Gilbert Associates, Inc., 345 U.S. 361, 365, 73 S.Ct. 701, 97 L.Ed. 1071 (1953); Illinois ex rel. Gordon v. Campbell, 329 U.S. 362, 370, 67 S.Ct. 340, 91 L.Ed. 348 (1946); United States v. Waddill, Holland &amp; Flinn, Inc., 323 U.S. 353, 355, 65 S.Ct. 304, 89 L.Ed. 294 (1945); United States v. Texas, 314 U.S. 480, 485-486, 62 S.Ct. 350, 86 L.Ed. 356 (1941). On the contrary, it has adhered to the view that \u201cin enacting \u00a7 3466 [31 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 191], Congress gave no indication whatever of intent to createdefeasible priorities.\u201d Massachusetts v. United States, 333 U.S. 611, 627, 68 S.Ct. 747, 757, 92 L.Ed. 968 (1948). See also United States Dept. of Agri., etc. v. Remund, 330 U.S. 539, 544-545, 67 S.Ct. 891, 91 L.Ed. 1082 <em>(1947); </em>Illinois ex rel. Gordon v. Campbell, 329 U.S. 362, 370, 67 S.Ct. 340, 91 L.Ed. 348 (1946); Illinois ex rel. Gordon v. United States, 328 U.S. 8, 12, 66 S.Ct. 841, 90 L.Ed. 1049-(1946); United States v. Emory, 314 U.S. 423, 433, 62 S.Ct. 317, 86 L.Ed. 315-(1941). We are likewise inclined to-doubt that any exception can be carved out of the sweeping language of section 191 which would allow an unforeclosed mechanic\u2019s lien, however labelled, to defeat the absolute priority secured to the-United States by the statute.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b934-10\">We do not reach this issue,, however, for there is no showing that the mechanic\u2019s liens here asserted are-sufficiently specific and choate to ward: off the Government's priority claim.. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>Even assuming, as the appellants insist, that the liens are choate as a matter of Virginia law,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> such characterization by a state is far from conclusive. United States v. Acri, 348 U.S. 211, 213, 75 S.Ct. 239, 99 L.Ed. 264 (1955); United States v. City of New Britain, 347 U.S. 81, 84, 74 S.Ct. 367, 98 L.Ed. 520 (1954); United States v. Security Trust &amp; Savings Bank, 340 U.S. 47, 49-50, 71 S.Ct. 111, 95 L.Ed. 53 (1950); Illinois ex rel. Gordon v. Campbell, 329 U.S. 362, 371, 67 S.Ct. 340, 91 L.Ed. 348 (1946); United States v.

We are instead bound to look to federal law, as announced by the Supreme Court, for the final answer. Aquilino v. United States, 363 U.S. 509, 514, 80 S.Ct. 1277, 4 L.Ed.2d 1365 (1960); United States v. Scovil, 348 U.S. 218, 220, 75 S.Ct. 244, 99 L.Ed. 271 (1955); United States v. Security Trust &amp; Savings Bank, 340 U.S. 47, 49, 71 S.Ct. 111, 95 L.Ed. 53 (1950); Illinois ex rel. Gordon v. Campbell, 329 U.S. 362, 371, 67 S.Ct. 340, 91 L.Ed. 348 (1946); United States v. Waddill, Holland &amp; Flinn, Inc., 323 U.S. 353, 357, 65 S.Ct. 304, 89 L.Ed. 294 (1945); United States v. Oklahoma, 261 U.S. 253, 260, 43 S.Ct. 295, 67 L.Ed. 638 (1923). See 1A Moore\u2019s Federal Practice, \u00a7 0.321. And the Court has made it abundantly clear that a competing lien cannot be considered specific and choate unless it has been \u201cattached to certain property <em>by reducing it to possession, </em>on the theory that the United States has no claim against property no longer in the possession of the debtor.\u201d United States v. Gilbert Associates, Inc., 345 U.S. 361, 366, 73 S.Ct. 701, 704, 97 L.Ed. 1071 (1953) (italics added). See also Thelusson v. Smith, 2 Wheat. 396, 4 L.Ed. 271 (1817); New York v. Maclay, 288 U. S. 290, 293-294; 53 S.Ct. 323, 77 L. Ed. 754 (1933); United States v. Texas, 314 U.S. 480, 484-485, 62 S.Ct. 350, 86 L.Ed. 356 (1941); Illinois ex rel. Gordon v. Campbell, 329 U.S. 362, 373-377, 67 S.Ct. 340, 91 L.Ed. 348 (1946). Cf. United States v. Durham Lumber Co., 257 F.2d 570, 573-574 (4th Cir., 1958) (federal tax liens which do not reach property of bankrupt-taxpayer\u2019s debtor cannot extinguish mechanic\u2019s liens asserted againt property). Applying the same test to mechanic\u2019s liens and claims of a similar nature, recent decisions leave little room for doubt that the interim steps of filing and recording the lien, without obtaining a final judgment enforcing the lien against the property, serves \u201cmerely as a caveat of a more perfect lien to come.\u201d <footnotemark>15</footnotemark> United States v. Vorreiter, 355 U.S. 15, 78 S.Ct. 19, 2 L.Ed.2d 23 (1957) (prior recorded mechanic\u2019s lien); United States v. White Bear Brewing Co., 350 U.S. 1010, 76 S.Ct. 646, 100 L.Ed. 871 (1956) (same); United States v. Colotta, 350 U.S. 808, 76 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>S.Ct. 82, 100 L.Ed. 725 (1955) (same); United States v. Hulley, 358 U.S. 66, 79 S.Ct. 117, 3 L.Ed.2d 106 (1958) (prior recorded materialman\u2019s lien); United States v. Scovil, 348 U.S. 218, 75 S.Ct. 244, 99 L.Ed. 271 (1955) (landlord\u2019s distress lien); United States v. Waddill, Holland &amp; Flinn, Inc., 323 U.S. 353, 65 S.Ct. 304, 89 L.Ed. 294 (1945) (same). This is so even though the mechanic\u2019s lien has been filed in the manner prescribed by state law and foreclosure proceedings are in progress at the time the Government first asserts its priority. United States v. White Bear Brewing Co., 350 U.S. 1010, 76 S.Ct. 646, 100 L.Ed. 871 (1956). And see United States v. Bond, 279 F.2d 837, 844-845, 849 (4th Cir., 1960) (majority and dissenting opinions); United States v. Latrobe Construction Co., 246 F.2d 357, 365 (5th Cir., 1957). Therefore, absent any showing that the mechanic\u2019s liens have divested the debtor of either title or possession, United States v. Gilbert Associates, Inc., 345 U.S. 361, 366, 73 S.Ct. 701, 97 L.Ed. 1071 (1953), we perceive no basis for exempting appellants from the operation of section 191.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b936-3\">II. THE VIRGINIA PRIORITY STATUTE AND \u201cFEDERAL COMMON LAW\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b936-4\">The federal insolvency statute being applicable, it is dispositive of the entire case. In the first place, it was established long ago that state laws purporting to fix priorities among lien-holders must yield to section 191 in any nonbankruptcy insolvency proceeding where it is applicable and seasonably invoked by the United States. Field v. United States, 9 Pet. 182, 200, 9 L.Ed. 94 (1835), per Marshall, C. J. See also Michigan v. United States, 317 U.S. 338, 340, 63 S.Ct. 302, 87 L.Ed. 312 (1943); United States v. Emory, 314 U.S. 423, 426-427, 62 S.Ct. 317, 86 L.Ed. 315 (1941); Barnett v. American Surety Co. of New York, 77 F.2d 225, 227 (10th Cir., 1935). Cf. United States v. Wad-dill, Holland &amp; Flinn, Inc., 323 U.S. 353, 356-357, 65 S.Ct. 304, 89 L.Ed. 294 (1945) (federal claim entitled to priority over landlord\u2019s distress lien accorded priority by Virginia statute). Hence, reliance by appellants upon the Virginia priority statute is misplaced, for however effective it may be on its face to secure their liens against competing non-federal claims, it is ineffective against claims of the United States. United States v. Security Trust &amp; Savings Bank, 340 U.S. 47, 51, 71 S.Ct. 111, 95 L.Ed. 53 (1950); Illinois ex rel. Gordon v. Campbell, 329 U.S. 362, 374-375, 67 S.Ct. 340, 91 L.Ed. 348 (1946).</p>\n<p id=\"b936-8\">On the other hand, the SB A having asserted consistently throughout these proceedings its priority under the federal insolvency statute,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> it cannot simultaneously claim benefit of the common law rule, recently reformulated in United States v. City of New Britain, 347 U.S. 81, 85, 74 S.Ct. 367, 370, 98 L.Ed. 520 (1954), by which \u201cthe first in time is the first in right.\u201d <footnotemark>18</footnotemark> In the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>New Britain case, involving a governmental claim of priority for federal tax liens, the Supreme Court repeatedly asserted that no question of insolvency was at stake and that section 191 was for that reason inapplicable. Indeed, to reinforce the point, the Court cited and carefully distinguished an earlier lien priority ease, United States v. Gilbert Associates, Inc., 345 U.S. 361, 73 S.Ct. 701, 97 L.Ed. 1071 (1953), solely on the ground that the United States in Gilbert had proven the taxpayer insolvent and invoked section 191. Therefore, \u201cin the absence of a statute to the contrary,\u201d the Supreme Court felt free in New Britain to resort to the common law principle now advanced by the SBA. We, on the other hand, are bound by the existing facts to give effect to the long-standing congressional declaration of priority embodied in section 191. We are not at liberty to supersede the unambiguous, clearly applicable statutory test with one rooted in common law.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b937-4\">III. EFFECT OF THE BANK\u2019S ASSIGNMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b937-5\">Judged in the light of Small Business Administration v. McClellan, 364 U.S. 446, 450, 81 S.Ct. 191, 5 L.Ed.2d 200 (1960), a case remarkably similar to our own, the SBA\u2019s claim to priority is wholly unaffected by the fact that formal assignment of the note evidencing the debt was not made by the participating bank until after the present proceedings were initiated. Nor does the SBA\u2019s contractual obligation to turn over 10% of any recovery on the note to the bank preclude any priority to which SBA is otherwise entitled. What the SBA does with any money collected on its 90% fractional interest in the loan is of no consequence to the issue of whether it may claim a priority. Id., 364 U.S. at 451-452, 81 S.Ct. at 195-196, 5 L.Ed.2d 200. On the other hand, we agree with the District Court\u2019s conclusion that the Government\u2019s statutory priority does not attach to the 10% fractional interest, in the note, of which the bank was the beneficial owner before the assignment was made to the Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-11\">In the McClellan case, the Supreme Court merely decided that the Government\u2019s priority extended to that portion of the loan as to which it initially held beneficial ownership, i. e., the portion of the loan consisting of funds put up by the SBA. The Court did not hold that the fractional interest put up by the private bank was entitled to priority. We think that the question whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>fractional interest that was assigned by the bank to the Government in this case is entitled to priority is governed by the principles of Nathanson v. N. L. R. B., 344 U.S. 25, 73 S.Ct. 80, 97 L.Ed. 23 (1952). In denying priority for a claim asserted by the Labor Board, the Court said in Nathanson:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b938-4\">\u201cIt does not follow that because the Board is an agency of the United States, any debt owed it is a debt owing the United States within the meaning of R.S. \u00a7 3466. The priority granted by that statute was designed \u2018to secure an adequate revenue to sustain the public burthens and discharge the public debts.\u2019 [Citation omitted.] There is no function here of assuring the public revenue. The beneficiaries of the claims are private persons * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b938-5\">\u201c* * * We cannot * * * give priority to a claim which the United States is collecting for the benefit of a private party.\u201d Id., 344 U.S. at 27-28, 73 S.Ct. 82-83, 97 L.Ed. 23.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b938-7\">Distinguishing but not overruling Nathanson in the McClellan decision, the Court stated that: \u201cThis Court\u2019s denial of priority in that case, involving claims in which the United States had no financial interest, would not justify a denial here where <em>the money was loaned by, </em>and the debt sought to be collected is due to, <em>the United States.\u201d </em>364 U.S. at 451, 81 S.Ct. at 195, 5 L.Ed.2d 200 (Emphasis added). Read together, the McClellan and Nathanson cases indicate that while the Government is free to dispose, as it wishes, of funds as to which it is entitled to a priority, it may not claim a priority for that portion of the debt that does not represent money actually loaned by the SBA. Consequently, in this case the SBA is entitled to a priority as to only 90% of the note.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-8\">The judgment of the District Court is therefore affirmed as modified.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-9\">Modified and affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b931-7\">. 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 631 et seq.

The overall objectives secured by this legislation have been summarized by the Supreme Court, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b931-8\">\u201cThe Small Business Act of 1953 created the Small Business Administration to \u2018aid, counsel, assist, and protect insofar as is possible the interests of small-business concerns in order to preserve free competitive enterprise * * * and to maintain and strengthen the overall economy of the Nation.\u2019 The Administration was given extraordinarily broad powers to accomplish these important objectives, including that of lending money to small businesses whenever they could not get necessary loans on reasonable terms from private lenders. When a part, but not all, of a necessary loan can be obtained from a hank or other private lender, the Administration is empowered to join that private lender in making the loan.\u201d Small Business Administration v. McClellan, 364 U.S. 446, 447, 81 S.Ct. 191, 193, 5 L.Ed.2d 200 (1960).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b931-12\">. The special master found, and it is generally conceded, that the land and original improvements existing at the time of the loan had a value of $25,500. The improvements thereafter placed on Food-co\u2019s property by the mechanics added $54.-500 to the value of the property, bringing the total valuation to $80,000.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b932-5\">. The deed made reference to Code of Va. \u00a7\u00a7 55-59 and 55-60, -which relate to the construction of Virginia deeds of trust and provide for foreclosure procedures in case of default. It does not appear that these two Code sections affect the determination of lien priorities, but merely define certain language employed in the deed of trust. Even if the deed had contained no specific reference thereto, these statutes would nevertheless govern its construction. Colonial Investment Co. v.

Indiana Flooring Co., 151 Va. 845, 145 S.E. 321 (1928), wherein it was held that the beneficiary of a prior recorded deed of trust is subordinated to the holders of subsequent mechanic\u2019s liens to the extent that the value of the property is increased by improvements.
