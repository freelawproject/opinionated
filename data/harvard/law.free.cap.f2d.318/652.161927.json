He was on leave from his position as a captain of Chicago Police. He enjoyed a good reputation.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">In its issue of November 24, 1961, Time published the alleged defamatory matter in reporting the filing of <em>Justice </em>by the Commission. The material subject of suit appears under \u201cPart VII. Equal Justice Under Law.\u201d In Part VII are two chapters: \u201c1. Introduction; and '2. Unlawful Police Violence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b701-8\">Chapter 2, \u201cUnlawful Police Violence,\u201d briefly describes eleven typical cases of police brutality. The Commission states: \u201cThe allegations of misconduct are supported in several cases by criminal convictions * * * or findings by impartial agencies; in others, by sworn testimony, affidavits from eye witnesses, or by staff field investigations. In no case has the Commission determined conclusively whether the complainants or the officers were correct in their statements. This is the function of a court. The Commission is of the opinion, however, that the allegations appeared substanstantial enough to justify discussion in the study.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b701-17\">The Time article, captioned \u201cCivil Rights \u2014 Dawdling on the Corner,\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> was based on that part of Chapter 2 of the Commission Report entitled \u201cPatterns of Police Brutality.\u201d Time noted the publishing of <em>Justice </em>by the Commission and went on to report incidents in Georgia and Chicago, two of the eleven incidents revealed in the Commission Report. The Chicago incident involved the arrest by Pape and other Chicago police officers of a Negro family named Monroe on Chicago\u2019s west side.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b701-18\">The District Court\u2019s opinion, sustaining Time\u2019s motion to dismiss, was that the article was a fair and accurate account of the Commission\u2019s Report, a matter of public interest and legitimate subject of comment of an honest purpose; and that the article did not exceed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>bounds of fair comment and was not actionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">The question is whether the District Court erred in finding, under Illinois law, that the complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. The subordinate, vital question is whether Time\u2019s report of what the Commission said about the Pape incident is fair comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">Time\u2019s article introduced the reader to <em>Justice </em>as carrying \u201ca chilling text about police brutality\u201d and that \u201cit stands as a grave indictment, since its facts were carefully investigated by field agents and it was signed by all six of the noted educators who comprise the Commission.\u201d The reader is told, in a footnote, who the noted educators are.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Time\u2019s second paragraph begins, \u201cThe bluntly frank report tells of a police officer, referred to only as \u2018Y\u2019, in Dawson, Ga.\u201d This and the third paragraphs tell of the Georgia incident through quotations, detailing the police brutality, from the victim, Brazier, and his wife, and quotations from the Report. The third paragraph concludes in Time\u2019s statement, \u201cBrazier died five days later, and \u2018Y\u2019 was never punished.\u201d In the fourth paragraph Time reported the Pape incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">The Pape incident is set forth in the Commission Report in this way:<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"AV1\"><em>Search, seizure, and violence: Chicago, 1958. </em>\u2014 The Supreme Court of the United States decided the case of Monroe v. Pape on February 20, 1961. Although this decision did not finally dispose of the case, it did permit the plaintiff to sue several Chicago police officers for violation of the Federal Civil Rights Acts on the basis of a complaint which alleged that:<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b702-9\">* * * [0]n October 29, 1958, at 5:45 a. m., thirteen Chicago police officers led by Deputy Chief of Detectives Pape, broke through two doors of the Monroe apartment, woke the Monroe couple with flashlights, and forced them at gunpoint to leave their bed and stand naked in the center of the living room; that the officers roused the six Monroe children and herded them into the living room; that Detective Pape struck Mr. Monroe several times with his flashlight, calling him \u201cnigger\u201d and \u201cblack boy\u201d; that another officer pushed Mrs. Monroe; that other officers hit and kicked several of the children and pushed them to the floor; that the police ransacked every room, throwing clothing from closets to the floor, dumping drawers, ripping mattress covers; that Mr. Monroe was then taken to the police station and detained on \u201copen\u201d charges for ten hours, during which time he was interrogated about a murder and exhibited in lineups; that he was not brought before a magistrate, although numerous magistrate\u2019s courts were accessible; that he was not advised of his procedural rights; that he was not permitted to- call his family or an attorney; that he was subsequently released without criminal charges having been filed against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-11\">Time began its report of the Commission\u2019s statement of the Pape incident this way: \u201cShifting to the North, the report cites Chicago police treatment of Negro <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>James Monroe and his family, who were awakened in their West Side apartment at 5:45 a. m. by 13 police officers, ostensibly investigating a murder.\u201d It continued: \u201cThe police, says <em>Justice, </em>broke through two doors * * Time then quoted the rest of the statement of the Commission verbatim. The Time paragraph concludes: \u201cThe officers were not punished, although Monroe has carried a suit to the Supreme Court, is still seeking a civil judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">We agree with the District Court that Time was not absolutely privileged in writing the article. The absolute privilege of the Commission did not protect Time. It had a \u201cqualified or conditional privilege,\u201d Cresson v. Dispatch Printing Co., 291 F. 632 (D.C. Minn.1923), to comment fairly upon, and criticize fairly, the Commission report. Under Illinois law, governing here, Time can be liable if it goes beyond that limit and \u201cstates as a fact that which is not true <em>* * *.\" </em>Cook v. East Shore Newspapers, Inc., 327 Ill.App. 559, 580, 64 N.E.2d 751, 761 (1945); Belt v. Tribune Co., 6 Ill.App.2d 489, 128 N.E.2d 638 (1955). \u201cIt is fundamental that fair comment and criticism cannot be predicated on an unfair or false statement of facts.\u201d Belt v. Tribune Co., 6 Ill.App.2d 489, at 494, 128 N.E.2d 638, at 640. The rule applies to writing about crime. Cook v. East Shore Newspapers, Inc., 327 Ill.App. 559, 585, 64 N.E.2d 751, 763 (1945).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">The test of the fairness of the Time article is the meaning which readers of common and reasonable understanding would ascribe to the language used, Belt v. Tribune Co., 6 Ill.App.2d 489, 493, 128 N.E.2d 638, 640 (1955). And as Justice John C. Lewe said in Dilling v. Illinois Publishing &amp; Printing Co., 340 Ill.App. 303, 306, 91 N.E.2d 635, 637 (1950), \u201c* * * a person of ordinary intelligence should read a newspaper article * * * with ordinarily intelligent discrimination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b703-10\">The question before us involves not what the Commission Report of 307 pages says of Pape, but only what the Time article says about the Report. The reader is set by the introduction, conditioned by the Georgia incident and its stark ending, and prepared to read how the Chicago police treated Monroe\u2019s family in the very early morning while \u201costensibly\u201d investigating a murder. Then the reader is told that <em>Justice </em>\u201csays\u201d Pape and others <em>did </em>what the Report merely said Monroe\u2019s complaint <em>alleged </em>Pape and others had done. The closing paragraph, relied on by Time to immunize it from liability, says the officers were not punished \u2014 as the article earlier stated \u201cY\u201d, in the Georgia incident, was not punished.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-12\">We conclude that Time took the risk, when it reworded parts of the Commission Report, that it might go too far, Cook v. East Shore Newspapers, Inc., 327 Ill.App. 559, 580, 582, 64 N.E.2d 751, 761, 763 (1945), quoting Judge O. W. Holmes, Jr. A jury could find that Time went beyond the limit of fairness here and in doing so was not protected by its privilege of fair comment, and that in making its article more interesting and readable for its audience, it departed from fidelity to the Commission Report. It is our opinion that a jury could read the Time article as stating that the Report said Pape and his follow officers <em>did </em>what the Commission Report merely said the Monroe complaint <em>alleged they did. </em>The typical newspaper reader could take from the article the impression that Pape and the other officers were not really investigating a murder when they mistreated the Monroe family, that the noted educators in <em>Justice </em>found that the Monroes were mistreated by Pape and the other officers, and that they were not being punished but ought to be.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-13\">It is true that the Commission had the facts alleged in the Monroe complaint, from which it quoted, investigated sufficiently to justify their use for the Commission\u2019s purposes in the Report. But the Commission was careful to state, at the beginning of its Report: \u201cIn no case has the Commission determined conclusively whether the complainants or the officers were correct in their state<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>ments.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Time article, however, does not say that. The article says that the Commission Report \u201cstands as a grave indictment, since its facts were carefully investigated.\u201d But the Report does not say that. The \u201ccarefully investigated\u201d statement in Time adds weight to its quotation, substituting the words \u201csays <em>Justice\u201d </em>for the words of the Report, \u201c * * * a complaint which alleged that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">Time argues that the \u201cinnocent construction\u201d rule requires this court to read the article \u201cinnocently,\u201d citing John v. Tribune Co., 24 Ill.2d 437, 442, 181 N.E.2d 105, 108 (1962). We are required by the rule in that case to give the Time article its \u201cnatural and obvious meaning.\u201d To read the article innocently, Time asks us to read the article as <em>not </em>saying what it does say. It says that the Civil Rights Commission said that Pape had, among other things, assaulted the Monroe family and violated their civil rights. In fact, the Commission said that a complaint in a civil action <em>alleged </em>that Pape had done those things.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">The complaint states a claim upon which relief can be granted. The District Court erred in ordering it dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">This court take judicial notice that, upon trial of Monroe v. Pape after remand by the Supreme Court, a verdict and judgment were recently entered for Monroe. After the District Court denied defendants\u2019 post-trial motions, except for a reduction of the verdict, Time made a motion in this court to dismiss the appeal for mootness. That motion was taken with the case and is hereby denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">The judgment is reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b701-9\">. Created by the Civil Rights Act of 1957, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1975, to study civil rights problems and report to the President and Congress.

Larehe, 363 U.S. 420, at 441, 80 S.Ct. 1502, at 1514, 4 L.Ed.2d 1307 (1960):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-12\">&lt;i * * * its function is purely investigative and fact-finding. It does not adjudicate.

In short, the Commission does not and cannot take \u25a0any affirmative action which will affect an individual\u2019s legal rights. The only purpose of its existence is to find facts which may subsequently be used as the basis for legislative or executive action.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b701-14\">. 5 U.

That case not having come to trial in court at that time, the Commission, for convenience, expressly quoted the charges of the Monroe complaint as set forth by Mr. Justice Frankfurter in his dissent, 365 U.S. 167, at 203-204, 81 S.Ct. 473, at 492-493.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-16\">Justice dealt with numerous other cases where police brutality charges had been made, discussed violence by others-than police, considered state and local remedies and the status and rights of the American Indian.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-17\">At 112, Justice made recommendations to Congress as to the advisability of remedial legislation.
