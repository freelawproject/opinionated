The Board\u2019s order and decision are reported at 136 NLRB No. 107.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">The Board, two members dissenting, found that the respondent Company violated Section 8(a) (3) and (1) of the Act<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> by discharging and refusing to reinstate certain employees and ordered the Company to cease and desist from the unfair labor practices found and from in any other manner interfering with employees\u2019 rights guaranteed under the Act; to make whole for wages lost the 50 employees who were discharged for engaging in a walkout on May 3, 1960, and were denied reinstatement the following day, but 37 of whom were later reinstated; to offer reinstatement to the 13 employees who had not been reinstated as of the time of the hearing; and to post designated notices.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">The employees discharged were employees who on May 3, 1960, failed to return to their work at the conclusion of a 10:00 A. M. work break period in response to demands of Company supervisors that they do so or be considered as voluntarily quitting. These and some thirty other employees had left the plant, taking their lunch pails and coats, at the commencement of the regular 10:00 A. M. work break, in expression of dissatisfaction with what the Company had characterized as its \u201cfinal offer\u201d made in connection with current contract negotiations.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">In February 1960, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, AFL-CIO, was certified as the collective bargaining representative of the Company\u2019s approximately 120 production and maintenance employees. The employees in the unit selected five of their number to serve on a Union bargaining committee which participated in the bargaining meetings with the Company\u2019s representatives. Kenneth Lee, an International Representative of the Union served as spokesman during the negotiations. During April 1960, Lee and the committee held a series of bargaining sessions with Company representatives. On May 2,1960, a meeting was held at which the Company presented what it stated to be its \u201cfinal offer\u201d. It was agreed that the proposal be submitted to a vote of the employees at a membership meeting. The committee determined that such meeting be held May 5, 1960. Lee suggested to the committee members that they not reveal the terms of the Company\u2019s offer until all the-employees were together at the meeting. But information as to the terms of the proposal was given by committee members to a number of employees who made inquiry the following morning (May 3, 1960) and the walkout and resulting discharges followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-8\">The main contested issue is. whether the walkout or strike was a protected concerted activity. The majority of the Board, supporting its Trial Examiner, concluded that it constituted \u201cconcerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining\u201d expressly protected by Section 7 of the Act. The Board\u2019s-findings are entitled to respect but they are to be measured by whether or not. they are supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole.. Universal Camera Corporation v. N. L. R. B., 340 U.S. 474, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed., 456.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-9\">When the record is considered as a. whole it reveals a combination of factors, which leads us to the conclusion that under the facts and circumstances presented' the action of the minority of the employees in refusing to return to work at. the termination of the work break period was not a protected activity but on the-contrary constituted interference with bona fide bargaining activity in progress between the Company and the employees\u2019 certified representative. We are of the-opinion that the rationale of Harnischfeger Corp. v. N. L. R. B., 7 Cir., 207 F.2d 575, and N. L. R. B. v. Draper Corporation, 4 Cir., 145 F.2d 199, 156 A.L.R. 989,. is applicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>The refusal of the minority group of 50 employees to return to their work at the conclusion of the work break occurred while contract negotiations were in progress and prior to the date scheduled for a meeting at which the employer\u2019s offer was to be considered by the employees. The Union, the employees\u2019 certified bargaining agent, did not call for, authorize or sanction the action. Nor did Union representative Lee, who was spokesman. A majority of the five employee bargaining committee members did not participate in the walkout. The fact that some employees who had learned of the terms of the Company offer were expressing dissatisfaction does not in our opinion support the Board\u2019s conclusion that the incident of May 3, 1960, was but an accelerated rejection of the offer. The 50 employees, a minority of the unit, had no authority to reject the offer. And, upon the showing made, we find no substantial basis for an inference that a majority had joined in an actual \u201crejection\u201d of the offer. Moreover, we are of the opinion that the appraisal <em>of </em>the record made by the dissenting Board members (136 N. L. R. B. 1258-1264) serves to more accurately take into account and reflect those factors which fairly detract from the weight of the testimony primarily relied upon by the Board. We see no need to repeat those \u2022observations here.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">We agree with the admonitions in Draper Corporation, supra (145 F.2d pp. 203 and 205) that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-6\">\u201cThe purpose of the act was not to guarantee to employees the right to \u2022do as they please but to guarantee to them the right of collective bargaining for the purpose of preserving industrial peace.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-7\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-8\">\u201c * * * there can be no effective bargaining if small groups of employees are at liberty to ignore the bargaining agency thus set up, take particular matters into their own hands and deal independently with -the employer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-9\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-10\">No surer way could be found to bring collective bargaining into general disrepute than to hold that \u2018wild-cat\u2019 strikes are protected by the collective bargaining statute.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b711-11\">And, whatever may have been the purpose or intent of the employees who participated in the refusal to resume work at the termination of the work break- \u2014 \u25a0 or of those who instigated such action \u2014 - we are of the opinion that the inherent effect of such action makes those admonitions applicable here. The record here, as in Harnischfeger, lacks the substantial support requisite to a finding that respondent violated the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-12\">Enforcement of the Board\u2019s order is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-13\">Enforcement denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b710-10\">.

There is no testimony as to the precise number of employees who took their coats and lunches with them on the break. There is no basis for the Board\u2019s statement in a footnote in its brief that seventy-five or eighty had indicated that they were striking because they had \u201cwalked out\u201d with their coats and lunch pails. Reynolds\u2019 testimony was that he saw \u201cthem\u201d with coats and lunch pails. This question is vital because the substance of the finding of the Board, as interpreted by the Board\u2019s brief, is that the effect of what happened at the morning break on May 3 was that a majority of the 120 member bargaining unit had, by striking, informally rejected the final offer of the respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">It may be that there were seventy-five or eighty in front of the plant during the morning break and that all of these were dissatisfied with the progress of their bargaining committee and with what they had learned from Reynolds and others of the final offer. It seems to me that the Board in describing the event as an expression of dissatisfaction indicates uncertainty on its part as to exactly what the employees\u2019 action was. In the context in which this event occurred and because of the vital nature attributed to the action of the employees by the Board, the only reasonable inference that can be drawn is that fifty-one who did not return to work struck and the balance had expressed dissatisfaction but had not struck.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">Respondent in its hurried response to the action mailed fifty-one letters to members who were refused work the following day, and it seems plain to me from Reynolds\u2019 testimony that only fifty-one of those who were outside the plant at the morning break actually refused to work. There is not substantial evidence that all, or the greater number, of the thirty returned under threat of having their cards pulled or had their lunch pails and coats with them.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">There is no necessity of discussing here the right to strike, or whether employees may strike only under union authorization, or whether less than a majority of employees may lawfully strike. A strike vote need not depend upon the' formality of Robert\u2019s Rules of Order, but before an inference can be drawn that a majority of employees by their conduct rejected the final offer, there ought to be more evidence than is in the record here, that a majority struck.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-8\">The 120 employees here selected the-International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers as a collective bargaining agent. They chose a bargaining committee from among themselves, and non-employee Lee, representing the Union, was spokesman for the committee. There was increasing dissatisfaction with the progress of the committee and a threatened strike during the week previous to the event subject of this proceeding. The bargaining unit did not revoke the authority of the bargaining committee. The Board found that in substance it was strengthening the committee\u2019s hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-9\">The committee, through Lee, promised respondent that the final offer would be submitted to a meeting of the bargaining unit on May 5. The following day fifty-one dissatisfied employees refused to work. It is true that respondent made no attempt to conciliate the men and seemed eager to exploit the event which the unprotected activity presented it. Respondent, however, was entitled to the good faith performance of the promise of the bargaining committee and the employees should have approved or disapproved the \u201cfinal offer\u201d through the bargaining committee they had chosen.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-10\">This choice had been made in accordance with the orderly procedure contemplated by the collective bargaining principle. It seems to me that the peace and order aimed at through that principle is frustrated when members of the bargaining committee strike as a means of strengthening the hand of the committee they have chosen to represent them, while simultaneously and ostensibly maintaining the authority of the committee. The effect of what was done by the employees who refused to work was, in my view, to detract from the dignity and power of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>the committee and to place the respondent in a dilemma as to where the power to negotiate for the employees rested.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">I think the conduct of the fifty-one employees who were not rehired on May 4 removed them from the protection of the Act.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b713-6\">SWYGERT, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AIV\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">I find that I must dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-8\">The National Labor Relations Board\u2019s trial examiner found that more than half \u2022of the employees in the bargaining unit of 120 walked out of Sunbeam\u2019s plant in Gary, Indiana, on the morning of May 3, 1960. This action followed the Company\u2019s \u201cfinal offer\u201d of a collective bargaining contract on May 2 and the Union representative\u2019s (Lee) statement to the 'Company that it would be presented to the Union membership for consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-9\">After approximately 75 to 80 employees walked out at 10:00 a. m., Company supervisors circulated among the employees outside the plant. The men were told to \u201ccome back to work, or their cards would be punched and they would be considered as voluntarily quitting\u201d for violating a plant rule requiring permission before leaving their work. As a result, approximately 30 employees returned to the \u25a0plant and normal operations were resumed at 11:00 a., m. Approximately 51 employees remained outside the plant, however, or went home. That afternoon Sunbeam mailed discharge notices to -these employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-10\">Late in the afternoon of May 3, bargaining committee chairman Reynolds received a telegram from Lee who was in Chicago. The telegram read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-11\">\u201cIn discussing the current sitiation [sic] at Sunbeam with our Sixth District International Office it was decided to inform the members of the negotiating committee that until further notice, there will be no further union or negotiating meetings while the unauthorized work stoppage continues.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b713-14\">A Union meeting was held that evening. Most of the 51 strikers attended. Reynolds read Lee\u2019s telegram. The members attending the meeting then voted unanimously to return to work the next morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-15\">On the morning of May 4, those of the. 51 employees who had not yet received the discharge letters reported at the plant at the regular time for work. The plant superintendent met them and told them that they would not be permitted to work; that they had \u201cterminated [them] selves\u201d by walking out the day before; and that their checks would be mailed to them.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b713-16\">I agree with the Board that this was not a \u201cwildcat\u201d strike. The trial examiner and the Board were justified, I think, in holding that a majority of the plant\u2019s employees went on strike to express their feelings about Sunbeam\u2019s \u201cfinal offer\u201d. This was not action by a dissident minority of the bargaining unit attempting to subvert the majority\u2019s objectives or to undermine the Union leadership. Rather, as the Board pointed out, it was a \u201cspontaneous reaction of [a majority of] the employees to the Respondent\u2019s offer\u201d which was actually in support of the aims of the Union.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-17\">That some thirty employees acceded to the threats of the supervisors following the work stoppage does not militate against the fact that the walkout was actually engaged in by a majority of the Union members or that it constituted a practical rejection of the Company\u2019s proffered contract terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>I do not think that either the rubrics of a formal strike vote or formal authorization by a union representative is prerequisite to gaining Section 7 protection for concerted activity. N. L. R. B. v. Washington Aluminum Co., 370 U.S. 9, 82 S.Ct. 1099, 8 L.Ed.2d 293 (1962). The employees here should not be deemed to have lost their Section 7 rights merely because they failed to follow a formal pattern in rejecting the Company\u2019s proposed contract terms. The fact of rejection by a majority was made clear; the Company was not entitled to insist on more.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">Both the majority and the concurring opinions seem to assume that a finding that a majority of the members of the bargaining unit went on strike is prerequisite to a holding that this was not a \u201cwildcat\u201d strike. No authority is cited for such a proposition and, indeed, I do not think it can logically be maintained in the present factual situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">Once the requirements of good faith bargaining have been met and a stalemate has come about, as here, even a minority, in my opinion, which in good faith believes it is acting in support of and consonant with the union\u2019s aims in rejecting an employer\u2019s \u201cfinal offer\u201d may take collective strike action to force the union\u2019s demands on the employer. Such action is not in derogation of or in conflict with the bargaining unit\u2019s aims. Certainly, it is not that kind of minority action constituting internecine factionalism condemned by the \u201cwildcat\u201d strike exception to employees\u2019 Section 7 rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">In the instant case immediately upon learning from the Union\u2019s business representative that the Union considered the strike to be unauthorized, the strikers sought to return to work. Obviously union discipline is not an issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">In my opinion the record considered as a whole shows that the discharged employees were engaged in protected, concerted activities within the meaning of Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act. I would enforce the Board's order.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b713-12\">. The mailing of the discharge notices within hours of the walkout and the refusal to reinstate the strikers the following morning when they reported for wox-k at the usxxal time evinces a precipitate seizure of an opportunity on the part of Sunbeam to weaken the Union Its anti-union animus is highlighted by the fact that when one of the returning strikers asked permission to get Ms coat, he was told that he could not enter the plant for anything and his coat would be brought to him.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
