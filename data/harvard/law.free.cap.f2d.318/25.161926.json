The firemen found, upon arx'ival, a whiskey still set up in the basement together with a quantity of sugar, bran, and half gallon fruit jars. Forty seven gallons of whiskey in jars containing no tax stamps were foxxnd at the still. Six vats coxxtaining a total of four thousand and fifty gallons of mash were found in the two bedrooms on the main floor. There was testimony by a revenue agent that the still appeared to have beexx in operation within a few hours of the fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-11\">No one was found at the house. Appellant rented the house on October 14, 1961 under an assumed name, some five months before the fire on March 20, 1962. He paid the rent monthly, making the last payment in person to the owner on March 13, 1962, seven days before the fire. Four letters addressed to him, and bearing recent dates, were found in the house. One of his fingerprints was found on a wine bottle taken from a refrigerator in the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-13\">This evidence, furnishing as it does a basis for a finding of constructive possession in appellant, was sufficient to support the jury verdict of guilty.
