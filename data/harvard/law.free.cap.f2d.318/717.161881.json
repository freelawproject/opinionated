We remanded the case to the Board with instructions to fashion an order in accordance with the modification.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-22\">The Board has now submitted an order purporting to be in accordance with our modification and a motion for its adoption. Counsel for the respondent filed a motion in opposition to the order submitted by the Board. Included in his motion are alternative provisions for paragraph 1(b) of the order and the paragraph of the notice concerning the wearing of bowling shirts by employees during working hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-23\">Upon consideration of the motions and the order, we are of the opinion that the alternative provisions submitted by counsel for the respondent more effectively comply with our order of modification than do those submitted by the Board. In the alternative provisions, counsel for the respondent has stricken the words \u201cor any other labor organization.\u201d It is proper to include such language in the order and notice and it should not be stricken.
