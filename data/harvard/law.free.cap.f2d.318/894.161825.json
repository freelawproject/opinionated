They will be hereinafter referred to respectively as \u201cPacific\u201d, \u201cFUCE\u201d, and \u201cNational\u201d. Pacific is the appellant; both FUCE and National are appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-7\">Pacific, FUCE and National are organized under the laws of Oregon, Minnesota and the District of Columbia, respectively, with principal places of business at Walla Walla, Washington; South St. Paul, Minnesota; and Albert Lea, Minnesota.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-8\">This is an interlocutory appeal, under Rule 54(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, from a judgment of dismissal of all claims against appellee National and the claims arising from the trademark issue, and the related issues of pendent unfair competition, raised against appellee FUCE, preserving the action against FUCE on other issues. The express determination by the trial court, required by Rule 54(b), was made and, as well, that there was no genuine issue of fact as to any matter covered by the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-9\">Jurisdiction rests not only upon diversity (28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332), and the federal statutes relating to trademarks and unfair competition (28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1338), but, as appellant states, is generally founded upon the Trademark Act of July 5, 1946 (the Lanham Act) <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201cand specifically on Section 39 of that Act [15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1121].\u201d Jurisdiction on this appeal rests on 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1121 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-13\">National was not in the case originally, but was brought in as an indispensable party by order of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-14\">The parties strongly disagree in their factual statement. Appellant\u2019s factual statement is marred by frequent references to rulings of the trial judge which it alleges were improper or inconsistent, interspaced with argument and criticism direct and implied relative to such rulings, and the alleged merits of its case.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-15\">Appellees\u2019 attack on appellant\u2019s brief, and its motion to dismiss the appeal on the ground it constitutes a flagrant violation of Rule 18(c) and (e) of this court, has substance. There are inadequate record references to alleged facts; there are vital and essential omissions from quoted material; and there are references to documents stricken from the record by the trial court without reference to the court\u2019s having so ruled. Appellant\u2019s brief is far from a model.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-16\">This court cannot condone such a presentation. Every appellate court \u00cd3 tempted to summarily grant such a motion as is here before us, for it seems the only way to bring the court\u2019s requirements as to briefs home to counsel with sufficient force as to cause counsel to follow and obey our rules of court. Yet most judges are plagued with the conviction that the sins of attorneys should not be visited upon their clients. With that thought uppermost, we decline to dismiss the appeal as moved by FUCE.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-17\">We proceed to the merits. Appellee National, critical of appellant\u2019s factual statement, lists certain stipulated facts, quoting the record and citing transcript <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number>page numbers for each statement made. Pacific denies that such stipulated facts are \u201ccontrolling\u201d (Reply Br. p. 3) (as they are characterized by National), but does not dispute in any way the correctness of the stipulated facts so referred to. For that reason, we adopt such statement, with its references to the record:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b944-4\">PORTION OF STIPULATED FACTS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b944-5\">\u201cI</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b944-6\">\u201cPrior to the organization of National Cooperatives, Inc., an Indiana corporation and subsequently by the reorganization, a District of Columbia cooperative corporation, the Midland Cooperative Oil Association, Minneapolis, Minnesota (later, Midland Consumers Co-op) and the Union Oil Company Co-operative, Kansas City, Missouri (later, Consumers Cooperative Association) adopted and used the trademark \u2018CO-OP\u2019 on and in connection with the advertising, manufacture, sale and distribution of various products, including petroleum products, tires and tubes.\u201d (R. 1451-1452; 9010-9011)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b944-7\">\u201cII</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b944-8\">\u201cPrior to the organization of National, Midland Cooperative Oil Association and the Union Oil Company Cooperative lawfully registered the trademark \u2018CO-OP\u2019 in the United States Patent Office.\u201d (R. 1452; 9011-9012)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b944-9\">\u201cIII</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b944-10\">\u201cPrior to the organization of National and in 1932, six cooperative associations, i. e.:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b944-11\">\u201c1.

Substantially all of National\u2019s business is with its regional wholesale cooperatives. Its charter members comprised six regional wholesale cooperatives, including Midland Cooperative Oil Association, later Midland Consumers Cooperative, Union Oil Company Cooperative, now Consumers Cooperative Association, and Farmers Union Central Exchange, Inc., hereinafter referred to as FUCE.

Upon organization Pacific applied for membership in National and the benefits thereof as a regional wholesale cooperative, and such application was accepted at a meeting of the board of directors of National, held February 12, 1934. At all times since, Pacific has been a regional wholesale cooperative and member shareholder of National.\u201d (R. 1453-1454; 9016)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b945-9\">\u201cVII</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b945-10\">\u201cNational, as now reorganized, is a non-profit cooperative association organized under Act of Congress, June 19, 1940, Public No. 642, 76th Congress, 54 Stat. 480, with principal office in Albert Lea, Minnesota. The reorganized corporation acquired all of the assets and assumed all of the liabilities of its predecessor. The membership of National is now composed of 26 regional wholesale cooperatives with equal rights, operating in most of the principal parts of the United States and in some parts of Canada. National\u2019s board is composed of representatives of the regional members. All capital of National, except loan capital, has been contributed by the regionals.\u201d (R. 1454; 9016-9017)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b945-13\">\u201cVIII</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b945-14\">\u201cPacific is a non-profit cooperative corporation, organized under Oregon Revised Statutes, Section 77-5-01, et seq., as a regional wholesale cooperative engaged in supplying farm supplies, including petroleum products, tires and tubes, to local retail cooperatives and marketing farm crops. Pacific, since 1950, has done business with about 120 local retail cooperatives. These locals own the voting shares of Pacific and serve at least fifty thousand farm families. All capital of Pacific, except preferred stock and loan capital, has been contributed by local retail cooperatives. Approximately 90% of these retail cooperatives are located in Washington, Idaho and Oregon, of which about 16 are located in Washington, at present. Pacific also does business in the following states: Northern California, Western Montana, Wyoming and Alaska. Pacific is licensed to do business in the foregoing states. About 40% of Pacific\u2019s gross volume is in petroleum products and about 15% is in crop marketing transactions. Pacific has never refined petroleum products.\u201d (R. 1454; 9017-9018)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b945-18\">\u201cIX</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b945-19\">\u201cFUCE is a non-profit cooperative corporation, organized under Minnesota statutes, Section 308.05, et seq., as a regional wholesale cooperative, with its principal office in South St. Paul, Minnesota.

These locals own the voting shares of FUCE and serve at least 250,000 farm families. All capital of FUCE except loan capital has been contributed by local retail cooperatives. FUCE now does business in the following states: Wisconsin, Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, Wyoming, Idaho, Washington and Oregon. About 65% of FUCE gross volume is in petroleum products. Since 1943 FUCE has operated a refinery at Laurel, Montana.

National\u2019s \u2018CO-OP\u2019 trademarked goods are distributed by its wholesale members to the local retail cooperatives. Both Pacific and FUCE have used the trademark \u2018CO-OP\u2019 wherever each has done business. The trademark has been and is regularly used by the parties in two ways: One, it is affixed by or on behalf of National to products manufactured by or for National and made available by National to its members for distribution on the retail level. Two, it is used by members of National on products such as petroleum products which National does not make available.\u201d (R. 1455-1456; 9019-9020)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b946-5\">\u201cXI</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b946-6\">\u201cThe trademark \u2018Universal\u2019 was adopted, used, and was registered in the Patent Office, Reg.

Thereafter, in 194.., National purchased the Universal Milking Machine Company, its trademarks and the good will symbolized thereby and received due assignments thereof. It has used and maintained such registrations and has renewed and reregistered the trademark \u2018Universal\u2019.

They are:</p>\n<p id=\"b950-4\">I. The trial court abused its discretion in the pre-trial proceedings in entertaining the motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-5\">II. The summary judgment was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-6\">III. The trial court\u2019s dismissal of the third party complaint under Rule 41(b), Fed.R.Civ.P., was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-7\">IV. The judgment \u201cabridges\u201d Pacific\u2019s trademark property rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-8\">V. The judgment was error because National and FUCE are estopped from use of the trademarks \u201cin Pacific\u2019s trade areas.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b950-9\">VI. The summary judgment erroneously eliminates the issue of unfair competition, <em>pendent </em>and <em>nonpendent.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b950-10\">VII. Error in dismissing all claims against National and some against FUCE, despite material issues of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-11\">Upon oral argument, it appeared to this court that appellant\u2019s position could best be narrowed down to the one question: Had Pacific acquired by any means an implied-in-fact exclusive- license to use in the Pacific Northwest the trademarks registered to National?</p>\n<p id=\"b950-12\">While a \u201cgrant\u201d of such an exclusive license was alleged, and that such grant had been later \u201cconfirmed,\u201d Pacific conceded in pretrial hearings, and on oral argument, that there is no formal agreement or contract containing any exclusive license with respect to the use of any trademark in favor of Pacific, unless it be by the Caldwell Agreement (R. 9030).</p>\n<p id=\"b950-13\">As stated in appellant\u2019s brief: \u201cPacific depends upon the usages, practices and customs of the parties to prove its exclusive rights and equitable ownership\u201d in the alleged exclusive license.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-14\">We have carefully considered the so-called \u201cCaldwell Agreement of April 14, 1941.\u201d We refer to appellant\u2019s brief, assuming it to be the strongest possible statement of appellant\u2019s position with respect to the meaning and legal effect of the Caldwell Agreement. It reads (p. 23):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b950-17\">\u201cIn 1939, Cooperative Oil Association (COA) of Caldwell, Idaho, a charter member of Pacific, withdrew from Pacific and sought membership in National. This application was refused by National, its minutes of September 8, 1939, reflecting:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b950-18\">\u201c \u2018Mr. Cort, (Midland) also reported that the Membership Application Committee had considered the application of COA at Caldwell, Idaho, for membership. He stated it was brought out in discussion that this organization had only recently withdrawn as a member of Pacific Supply Cooperative and it would be operating within the territory of Pacific Supply Cooperative, and stated for that reason the Committee denied the application * * (R. 760)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b950-20\">COA sued Pacific and National claiming exclusive rights to use of the \u2018CO-OP\u2019 trademark in the state of Idaho. Negotiations culminated in a settlement agreement referred to as the \u2018Caldwell Agreement,\u2019 dated April 14, 1941. In the defense of the COA action, National and Pacific both represented that Pacific was then possessed of exclusive trademark rights within its trade area. (R. 1439-1444; 306-308; 1116-1126).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b950-22\">What National and Pacific \u201crepresented\u201d in the \u201cCaldwell Agreement\u201d is, of course, purely a conclusion of appellant. And what was pleaded or asserted in defense of a law suit does not necessarily become part of an agreement made in settlement of that law suit.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"903\">*903</page-number>National quotes certain exact language taken from that \u201cCaldwell Agreement.\u201d Paragraph 9 permitted COA to purchase through Pacific, at a markup, within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>Pacific\u2019s \u201cterritory,\u201d merchandise made available through National. COA agreed in return not to use the trademarks, \u201cthe essential feature of which consists of the word \u2018CO-OP.\u2019 \u201d In Paragraph 10 COA agreed not to sell gasoline and other petroleum products under the CO-OP trademark of an inferior quality, or \u201cother than in territory of second party\u201d (Pacific). COA in Paragraph 11 agreed not to solicit customers from Pacific\u2019s members, and <em>vice versa,. </em>The pending litigation was dismissed \u201cwithout prejudice,\u201d and in Paragraph 14 it was provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b952-3\">\u201cIt is further expressly agreed that neither the execution of this agreement nor any of the provisions thereof, nor the dismissal of either of the suits hereinbefore mentioned, shall be deemed or construed to be a waiver of, or prejudicial to, any of the rights that any of the parties hereto may now have to the use of trademarks, brands, names and labels, the essential feature of which is the word \u2018CO-OP\u2019.\u201d (R. 395)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b952-4\">We cannot read the Caldwell Agreement as appellant so readily does \u2014 as establishing \u201can exclusive trademark right within Pacific\u2019s trade area.\u201d In fact, it created and permitted two competing marketing organizations within the area Pacific now claims exclusively; permitting each to use the CO-OP trademark with certain restrictions on quality of products sold and solicitation of customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-5\">Early in 1941, Charles Baker, general manager and secretary of Pacific and a director of National (see note 2, supra), had filed an affidavit in the action out of which the Caldwell Agreement arose, which recited:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b952-6\">\u201cthat said National Cooperatives, Inc., has since the ye..r 1933 licensed unto Pacific * * * <em>the exclusive right </em>to the use of the trademarks, brands, names and labels, the essential feature of which * * * consist of the word \u2018CO-OP\u2019 in the territory which Pacific Supply Cooperative has operated and now is operating * * (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b952-9\">Pacific also makes the statement that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AXg\">\u201cNational reconfirmed its policy and required CCA (sic) and Midland to recognize that each regional must respect the exclusive ownership of good will of the other regional members of the joint venture.\u201d (Br. p. 24. Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b952-11\">The first reference to exclusive use of trademarks is clear. We do not understand this second statement with reference to good will, however, unless it is an attempt to prove (as appellant states later in its brief) that members of National were, in 1940, authorized to use the trademark in certain definite territories, and that National would undertake to prevent anyone else, members or nonmembers, from using it in that territory. To give Pacific the benefit of any doubt we assume this was stated by one Cowden, secretary of National, in 1940; and the same position was taken on several occasions by National prior to late in 1944.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-12\">BY-LAWS</p>\n<p id=\"b952-13\">We next consider one of the important aspects of the case. In attempting to determine the understanding of the parties, we go to the content of the Articles of Incorporation and the By-Laws of the various corporations involved. The validity and value of this approach is recognized by all parties hereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-14\">On February 19, 1935, National adopted by-laws containing among other matters, as amended March 18, 1936, the Article X, Section 3, quoted at page 901, supra, which referred to \u201cthe territory of such members.\u201d (R. 750)</p>\n<p id=\"b953-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"905\">*905</page-number>On December 20, 1944, this Section 3 of Article X was eliminated by the adoption of new by-laws. Article VIII then read as quoted at page 901, supra, and referred to use of the trademark \u201cin competing territory.\u201d (R. 769)</p>\n<p id=\"b953-4\">Article IX replaced Article VIII on September 8, 1946, and reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b953-5\">\u201cARTICLE IX <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b953-6\">\u201cTRADE MARK</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AXe\">\u201cSection 1. <em>Trade Mark. </em>If a member individually uses the trade mark Co-op, it shall use its own corporate name conspicuously in connection therewith. The name \u2018National Cooperatives, Inc.\u2019 in connection with the trade mark Co-op may be used only on those products distributed by this association directly or against a contract negotiated by this association.\u201d (R. 770)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b953-7\">CONDUCT</p>\n<p id=\"b953-8\">Pacific makes the flat statement \u201cFrom 1934 to date National has required all parties in Pacific\u2019s trade territory seeking use of trademarked goods sponsored through National by the regionals to obtain them solely through Pacific.\u201d (R. 768; 1208; 339; 349) \u201cThe only breach of Pacific\u2019s said contractual rights and relations has been with reference to FUCE\u2019s recent violations.\u201d (R. 1056; 298-299; 383-385; 1053-B; 1066-1067) Yet the volume of sales by FUCE to local cooperatives in Montana, Wyoming, Idaho and Washington is shown by stipulation (R. 867-910). (See \u201c(d)\u201d p. 901, supra.) These figures directly contradict appellant\u2019s flat statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-9\">The area claimed by Pacific includes each of the states mentioned in the stipulation. (R. 4) Thus, by the stipulated facts, Pacific\u2019s exclusive territory was <em>not </em>recognized by FUCE or National, since a time prior to the Caldwell Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-10\">Yet, says Pacific, FUCE for the first time came into Pacific\u2019s territory in 1954, and began taking away Pacific\u2019s customers, finally hiring away its longtime employee, Johnson.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-15\">On the aforesaid briefly described factual situation, somewhat contradictory in character, appellees\u2019 position is that the trial court correctly determined, solely as an issue of law, that National was the owner of all trademarks and trade names in issue; that Pacific is a licensee of National ; as such licensee Pacific cannot acquire adverse rights against its licensor; that the rights of National are incontestable under the Lanham Act; that Pacific\u2019s rights in the trademarks and trade names of National are such as are granted by the Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws only \u2014 and that the Lanham Act controls, both on the issue of infringement and of Pendent Unfair Competition or Pendent Unfair Trading. (R. 1249)</p>\n<p id=\"b953-16\">THE LANHAM ACT</p>\n<p id=\"b953-17\">Trademark Rights are not dependent on statutory enactment, but arise under common law from prior exclusive appropriation or adoption and use. Piggly Wiggly Corp. v. Saunders, 6 Cir., 1924, 1 F.2d 572.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-18\"> The Trade Mark Act of 1905 did not change the common law rights in trademarks, but did add to those rights, and did protect them, not only for the benefit of the owners, but of the public. A trademark is an arbitrary symbol affixed by the manufacturer, or by one who has his products manufactured, to a vendible product, which designates and distinguishes such product and protects the manufacturer\u2019s good will, existing because of his business and the quality of his product.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-19\">But the 1905 Act required amendments (those in 1920 and 1938, substantial in nature) and in 1947 the Lanham Trade Mark Act became effective, after its adoption the previous year. Its purpose was not only to clear up inconsistencies and alleged \u201cconstructions\u201d of prior acts which \u201cobscured and perverted\u201d their original purpose<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> but to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"906\">*906</page-number>simplify practices, carry out international commitments, and to create new substantive rights in registration, and thus create an incentive to registration.</p>\n<p id=\"APP\">Among the new substantive rights recognized and created was the \u201ccollective mark\u201d \u2014 a mark to be used by the members of a cooperative, association or other group to identify and distinguish the goods or sources of members.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b954-5\">For the first time registration of a mark gave <em>constructive notice to the world </em>of the registrant\u2019s claim of ownership (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1072), including those previously relying on an intrastate use only. Not only did the registration establish prima facie evidence of ownership, but likewise prima facie evidence of validity of the registration and of the registrant\u2019s exclusive right to use. After any five year use of a registered mark, it is incontestable if necessary affidavits are filed. (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1065.) Marks renewed or registered under the old Act receive the procedural and remedial advantages of the new Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-6\">Collective marks (as are here involved) are provided for in 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1054. Section 1055, which follows, reads :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AJK\">\u201cWhere a * * * mark * * * is or may be used legitimately by related companies, such use shall inure to the benefit of the registrant, * * * and such use shall not affect the validity of such mark or its registration, provided such mark is not used in such manner as to deceive the public.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b954-8\">\u201cRelated companies\u201d is defined in 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1127. And concurrent registration by more than one user was permitted. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1051.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-9\">It was stipulated here that the trademark \u201cCO-OP\u201d had been registered as a collective mark under the Lanham Act. (R. 919-934) It is admitted that the trademark CO-OP is incontestable under the Lanham Act (R. 272-273; 288; 1316). Under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1057(b) registrant\u2019s right to use is an \u201cexclusive right to use * * * in commerce.\u201d Curtis-Stephens-Embry Co. v. Pro-TekToe Skate Stop Co., 8 Cir., 199 F.2d 407; Rolley, Inc. v. Younghusband, 9 Cir., 1953, 204 F.2d 209.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-13\">It is difficult to see, therefore, how any use by Pacific, a \u201crelated company\u201d as defined by the Act, can do more than \u201cinure to the benefit of the registrant\u201d\u2014 National.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-14\">ESTOPPEL</p>\n<p id=\"b954-15\">Entirely apart from the Lanham Act, estoppel <em>in pais </em>is raised by National against Pacific. Pacific represented to the United States Patent Office that the word \u201cCO-OP\u201d belonged to National. (R. 2880; 8890-8891; 9074.)</p>\n<p id=\"b954-16\">In Holly Hill Citrus Growers\u2019 Ass\u2019n v. Holly Hill Fruit Products, Inc., 5 Cir. 1935, 75 F.2d 13, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b954-17\">\u201cThere is a kind of evidential estoppel which, though it may not amount to a complete estoppel in pais, is raised when persons who have spoken or acted one way under one set of circumstances, and with one objective in mind, undertake under other circumstances and when their objective has changed, to testimonially give a different color to what they formerly said and did. We think that principle applies here.\u201d (At p. 17 of 75 F.2d)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b954-19\">To paraphrase the facts and opinion in the Holly Hill case, supra, and make the principle applicable here\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b954-20\">\u201cPacific cannot now say, \u2018What I really intended you [National] to do was to have the trademarks issued in your name, and you were to have an \u201cincontestable right\u201d to use them as long as I was pleased with the manner in which you used them; as long as you didn\u2019t interfere with my <em>exclusive </em>use in such territory, as I think I should have exclusive use.\u2019 Pacific must say now what in effect it said, and enabled National to say, then.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b955-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number>Pacific has pleaded it is a licensee of National. (R. 4, 5, 6,7, 29, 32, 33, 34, 35, 37, 40, 94, 197, 199.) That National is the owner is pleaded (R. 460; 913); stipulated (R. 919-934); and admitted (R. 272-273; 287-288).</p>\n<p id=\"b955-5\">The right of Pacific, FUCE, and twenty-four other regional wholesale cooperatives arises from their membership in National. (Admitted Facts, Paras. IV, VI and VII.) That right is defined by the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of National (supra).</p>\n<p id=\"b955-6\">The By-laws of National, as we have seen, grant non-exclusive and equal rights to all of National members, to use its trademarks anywhere. These Bylaws were executed subsequent to the alleged \u201cCaldwell Agreement\u201d upon which Pacific primarily relies (R. 769, 770), and supersede it. Stevenot v. Norberg, 9 Cir. 1954, 210 F.2d 615. There the court said the change made by the stockholders in the By-laws</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b955-7\">\u201cwas valid and effective. * * * The language of the amendment is clear, unequivocal, and unambiguous. No irregularity or fraud in its adoption is asserted. It cannot be held to have no force or effect, merely because of some mental reservation or unexpressed intention which the stockholders may have had when they adopted it.\u201d (Id. at 618.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b955-9\">The above argument has assumed, as appellant urges, that the \u201cCaldwell Agreement\u201d creates an <em>exclusive </em>right to use the CO-OP trademark in Pacific. Yet by the agreement itself, Caldwell was permitted to use the trademark COOP on goods it could purchase from Pacific, <em>and, to use it on petroleum products, </em>of a required standard, <em>which were not made available by National. </em>Thus the Caldwell Agreement created no <em>express </em>grant of an exclusive territorial right.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-10\">Where there is no express grant of exclusive territory in a contract or franchise, none will be impliedly read into the contract, <em>as a general rule. </em>Parkway Baking Co. v. Freihofer Baking Co., 3 Cir. 1958, 255 F.2d 641, 647. But the law recognizes exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-11\">As an expression of the exception to the general rule, Pacific relies heavily on Huber Baking Co. v. Stroehmann Bros. Co., 2 Cir. 1958, 252 F.2d 945. We think this reliance is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-12\">Pluber, in granting trademark rights to Quality Bakers Association (Hereafter QBA), reserved \u201cfull and unrestricted\u201d trademark rights to the grantor in a designated area, i. e., where Huber had used the trademark and where Huber intended to use the trademark in the future. The right granted was in and to the use of an \u201cenlarged\u201d mark. This gave \u201crise to a valid and binding estoppel against QBA.\u201d Here National recognized no reservation of any rights in Pacific.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-13\">Judge Medina in the Huber case also held Huber was not estopped in his claim by his assignment to QBA. The license that Huber received back after its assignment was different than that given out by QBA to its other associates. The \u201cSunbeam\u201d licensing contract with Huber contained three matters <em>not </em>in the other \u201cSunbeam\u201d licenses\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b955-14\">(1) All other licenses specifically stated they were nonexclusive; Huber\u2019s did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-15\">(2) Huber retained the right to assign \u2014the antithesis of an exclusive right in QBA.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-16\">(3) Huber <em>claimed </em>and <em>obtained </em>the exclusive right to use \u201cSunbeam\u201d in the Philadelphia area, then only partly served by H\u00faber, when Stroehmann \u201cwanted in\u201d on the Philadelphia area. QBA recognized this claim of right by refusing Stroehmann.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-17\">We contrast those facts to the factual situation here, where\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b955-18\">(1) the stipulated facts show (R. 867-910) that Pacific had competition from FUCE in areas originally or now claimed to be exclusively Pacific\u2019s, since 1939 in Montana (R. 883; 906) ; since 1943 in Wyoming (R. 868; 886); since 1943 in Idaho (R. 875-876; 893-896); since 1955 in Washington (R. 874-893); since 19.. in Utah, Nevada and California (R. 1458-1460; 9208-9210); and since 1959 in Oregon (R. 1140-1143; 75-88). '</p>\n<p id=\"b956-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number>(2) that Pacific tried, unsuccessfully, to establish its exclusive rights to certain territory.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-3\">We quote from appellee FUCE\u2019s brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b956-4\">\u201cWhen National was reorganized as a Washington, D. C. corporation in 1944, Mr. Charles Baker participated as a member of Pacific in the formulation of its original trademark by-law (R. 769). He likewise participated in the adoption of an amended trademark by-law in 1946, which is currently in effect (R. 770).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b956-5\">\u201cMr. Baker served as General Manager and Secretary of Pacific since 1935 and as its representative on National\u2019s board during that period; he has been President of National since 1952 (R. 9023-9024; 1457).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b956-6\">\u201c[There is then quoted a reference to the changes in By-laws, herein-above discussed in detail earlier in this opinion.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b956-7\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b956-8\">\u201cIn the deposition of Mr. Baker, both he and Pacific\u2019s counsel admitted that this by-lav/ accords to members of National the right to use its trademarks (R. 5778). Mr. Baker further admitted that competition has existed, principally in the Midwest, between a number of regional co-operatives, using the trademarks of National in the course of such competition \u2018from the year one\u2019 (R. 5778-5779).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b956-9\">\u201cOn several occasions Mr. Baker has attempted to persuade the board of National to adopt procedures for the grant of exclusive territories, but such proposals have been rejected. (R. 5781, 5782; 773, 775, 776, 777-780; 781). On August 17, 1955 (R. 775), Mr. Baker made the following motion, which was subsequently tabled:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b956-10\">\u201c <em>\u2018Moved </em>by Mr. Baker, seconded by Mr. J. E. Rose, <em>that the notice of the annual meeting inform members that the agenda will include consideration of a proposed by-law addition that it shall be the future policy of National Cooperatives, Inc., to grant franchises by geographical territories </em>and by regional and local associations on the merchandise which it manufactures or purchases and distributes.\u2019 (R. 776) (Emphasis added).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b956-12\">(3) Pacific first claimed exclusive territorial rights in seven western states. As we have seen, the proof showed competition from members of National in California, Utah, and Nevada. Pacific then claimed \u201cexclusive rights\u201d in Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Montana and Wyoming. The latter three were proved to have had competition from members of National for years, at least since 1943.</p>\n<p id=\"AcQ\">Yet Pacific stated to the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b956-13\">\u201cWe contend there was no agreement for division of territory and we want to make that very definite that National nor the constituent members of National <em>at no time arrived at cmy agreement </em>for the division of the territory.\u201d (R. 8886) (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b956-14\"><em>\u201cThe Court: </em>Do I understand you to say you wanted to be understood there was no agreement for division of territory?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b956-15\"><em>\u201cMr. Sherwood: </em>That is true.\u201d (R. 8887)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b956-16\">Mr. Sherwood had explained that \u201cthe division of territories was created out of the users of this mark in the several localities creating the good will for each of these constituent members to the point wherein 1954 * * * we had valuable property rights.\u201d (R. 8886)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b956-17\">But in taking this position, appellant fails to recognize the long settled principle of law that a licensee (and Pacific had been that at least since 1944) of a trademark or trade name may not set up any adverse claim in it as against its licensor. Such use as a recognized licensee (pleaded and admitted by Pacific), sets up no rights in that licensee adverse to the terms of the license and the actual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>circumstances of the use. Hicks v. Anchor Packing Co., 3 Cir. 1926, 16 F.2d 723, 726; Medd v. Boyd Wagner, Inc., D.C., 1955, 132 F.Supp. 399; E. F. Prichard Co. v. Consumers Brewing Co., 6 Cir. 1943, 136 F.2d 512, 522, certiorari denied, 321 U.S. 763, 64 S.Ct. 486, 88 L. Ed. 1060.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-4\">(4) Appellant relies upon an alleged contract for exclusive use of trademarks allegedly existing over a period of years, and then a \u201crevocation action\u201d or \u201cpolicy change\u201d that denied the right to exclusive use, with alleged destructive effect on good will and business values generated by \u201clong-time exclusive use of the marks.\u201d (Appellant\u2019s Br., p. 6.) Just what business result obtains under any license of a trademark, whether exclusive or nonexclusive, by an owner-licensor to a licensee \u2014 when the license expires by its terms or is terminated for other reasons? (A similar situation exists when any distribution or agency contract ends by its terms or is terminated for a variety of business reasons.) Such a termination with its resultant loss of business and profit does not create equitable rights in the licensee upon which recovery for such losses can be claimed or established; nor does it create any form of estoppel against the original licensor. Thus, while it must be admitted that Pacific <em>claimed </em>an exclusive right to use the trademarks, primarily through its officer, Baker, down through the years \u2014 that right was never recognized by any consistent course of conduct between the parties to this litigation \u2014 nor any unequivocal acknowledgement in writing by appellees that appellant\u2019s position was correct. The opposite occurred. Thus no exclusive right was created even impliedly, by the action of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-5\">USE OF OTHER TRADEMARKS</p>\n<p id=\"b957-6\">There are other trademarks than COOP which are mentioned in the appellant\u2019s brief (\u201cNational,\u201d \u201cNational Cooperatives,\u201d \u201cCapri\u201d and \u201cUniversal\u201d). Yet we agree with appellees that they have been stipulated out of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-7\">It was stipulated the first two are part of the corporate name of National Cooperatives, Inc. and are not registered as trademarks (R. 9022-9023; 1457; Stipulated Fact XIV, supra.)</p>\n<p id=\"b957-8\">National purchased the trademark \u201cUniversal\u201d in the 1940\u2019s, and registered it in its own name. (Stipulated Fact X, supra.) National registered \u201cCapri\u201d in 1958. Pacific, FUCE and the other cooperatives have used these names only on goods supplied and sponsored by National, or to evidence membership in National. (Stipulated Facts XII and XIV, supra.) It is stipulated they have never been affixed by Pacific or FUCE to any products. (R. 9022-9023; 1457.) Thus, technically, Pacific has never <em>used </em>these \u201ctrademarks,\u201d and the right to trademarks is founded, not on ownership, legal or equitable, but on use. 1 Nims, Unfair Competition and Trademarks 635, 636 (4th ed. 1947).</p>\n<p id=\"b957-9\">PENDENT UNFAIR COMPETITION <footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b957-10\">Section 1338, Title 28, United States Code, provides jurisdiction in the United States Courts \u201cwhen joined with a substantial and related claim under * * * the trademark laws.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b957-11\">As nearly as we can tell from the briefs of appellant, the oral argument, and the representations made by appellant\u2019s counsel to the court below, the so-called issues of pendent unfair competition depend entirely upon the assertion of appellant Pacific that it has acquired an implied-in-faet exclusive license to use, in the Pacific northwest, the trademarks registered to National. The trial court having held, as a matter of law, that it has no such exclusive license, and we having held that this determination is correct, there is thus no support for the cause of action asserted under the label of pendent unfair competition.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-12\">We see nothing in Pursche v. Atlas Scraper, 9 Cir. 1961, 300 F.2d 467, nor in the Columbia Law Review note on Pendent Jurisdiction (62 Col.L.Rev. 1018 at 1048), that renders the trial court\u2019s position untenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>Appellant simply did not establish its right to rely upon an implied-in-fact exclusive license to use National\u2019s trademarks existing by reason of the usages, practices and customs of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-4\">PROCEDURE</p>\n<p id=\"b958-5\">In ruling as it did below, the trial court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b958-6\">\u201c * * * I think that after repeated pre-trial conferences and after repeated opportunities of the plaintiff to consider his third party complaint in light of the fact that a complaint such as that should contain the allegations with which the plaintiff expects to charge the third party defendant, that I should grant the motion of National to dismiss and I do so both granting the motion under 41(b) and the motion which is made August 15 and noted for argument day before yesterday in which they say:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b958-7\">\u201c \u2018That there has been no actionable wrongful inducement to cause member cooperatives of plaintiff to breach their membership contract and to dismiss all claims based upon such contention.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b958-8\">and not as part of the pre-trial but as part of the motions and as part of the motions directed to the pleadings and as part of the motion, and partly on a motion for relief under 41(b). I feel that this matter has approached a phase that leads me to believe unless there is a definite limitation of issues and charges and counter charges, that this case will get far beyond any possible realm in which human endeavor can limit it, and so I feel that is necessary under the circumstances to do that and, accordingly, the motion is granted and National is dismissed.\u201d (R. 9609-9610.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b958-9\">Appellee FUCE\u2019s motion to dismiss was denied under Rule 41(b) (R. 1244), and appellee FUCE was required to elect as to certain defenses. The motion of third party defendant to dismiss was granted under Rule 41(b) \u201cas to the claims of Plaintiff based upon inducement to breach of contract, fraud, aiding and abetting and conspiracy,\u201d because of the inadequacy \u201cto charge the Third Party Defendant with any claim on account thereof; * * * [that] there is no genuine issue of material fact thereon\u201d; a partial summary judgment was granted \u201cas to the issue of Exclusiveness and the related issues of Trademark Infringement and Pendent Unfair Competition.\u201d Defendant National was decreed the owner of the trademarks and trade names; the plaintiff Pacific was adjudicated a licensee of National.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b958-12\">\u201c * * * The Court determines and adjudicates: the Third Party Defendant is the owner of all trademarks and trade names in issue; Plaintiff is a licensee of Third Party Defendant; as such a licensee Plaintiff cannot acquire adverse rights against its licensor; the rights of Third Party Defendant are incontestable under the Lanham Act; Plaintiff has only such rights in trademarks and trade names of the Third Party Defendant as are granted by the Articles and By-Laws of Third Party Defendant which grant to all members of Third Party Defendant equal and non-exclusive rights; Plaintiff has failed to produce or show in the course of pretrial proceedings any matter which would vary or change non-exclusive rights or raise any genuine issue of material facts thereon; the issues of Trademark and Tradename Infringement and Pendent Unfair Competition or Pendent Unfair Trading, are governed by the Lanham Act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b958-13\">\u201c(3) The Court specifically finds and determines that judgment should be entered immediately as to one or more, but fewer than all, of the claims or parties and that there is no just reason for delay; further, that there is no genuine issue of material fact as to any of the matters covered by such judgment. The Court accordingly directs entry of final judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"911\">*911</page-number>ment and does hereby enter judgment as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b959-5\">\u201cIt Is Ordered and Adjudged that the Third Party Complaint be and the same is hereby dismissed with prejudice * * (R. 1249)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b959-6\">We find no error in such ruling in the record before us, for the reasons heretofore stated. We hold the pre-trial hearings were properly terminated; that in striking Pacific\u2019s request for \u201cAdmission and Genuineness of Documents and to Admit Exhibits Into Evidence\u201d (clearly filed in violation of the trial court\u2019s orders) the trial court acted properly.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-7\">We affirm the judgment below, both as to the defendant FUCE and the third party defendant National.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b943-10\">. \u201c1121. <em>iSame; jurisdiction of Federal courts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b943-11\">\u201cThe district and territorial courts of the United States shall have original jurisdiction, the circuit courts of appeal\" of the United States and the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia shall have appellate jurisdiction, of all actions arising under this chapter, without regard to the amount in controversy or to diversity or lack of diversity of the citizenship of the parties.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b950-15\">. Purely as an example, we have carefully studied the references cited by appellant and relied upon by it in support of its statement that <em>\u201cNational and Pacific doth represented </em>that Pacific was then possessed of exclusive trademark rights within its trade area.\u201d (Appellant\u2019s Br., p. 23.

Thus, there is no reference to any agreement by National that Pacific had exclusive trademark rights.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b951-8\">(4) Pacific\u2019s statement then quotes certain allegations from its own complaint in intervention in the Caldwell litigation, referring to what Pacific\u2019s local units \u201cintended\u201d to do to protect its exclusive use (Tr. 1441).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b951-9\">(5) Pacific then makes the self-serving references to its own pleadings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b951-10\">(6) Pacific then refers to aflidavits filed by it, signed by Charles Baker, its officer, referring to its alleged exclusive right to use the trademarks involved (Tr. 1443-1444).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b951-11\">(b) <em>Tr. 806-308.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b951-12\">(1) These pages refer to the affidavit of Charles Baker (which states Pacific <em>had the exclusive right, </em>by license from the owner National, of the trademark \u201cCO-OP\u201d), which was filed in Idaho state (so-called Caldwell) litigation.
