The jury could have thought Galvan was scared by the shotgun in the officer\u2019s hands when he approached. But it did not have to do so. It could accept the officer\u2019s story. We have no trouble with this count.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-20\">As to the first count on the narcotics, the government has no evidence to spare, but we deem it enough. After the approach by Officer Olexa, with other officers in the area where the arrest was made, Galvan accelerated his car. As he fled, Officer Olexa fired shots into the Cadillac\u2019s tires. Galvan drove the car on through stop signs, dodged an attempted road block, knocked a garbage can over and bounced around over lawns of nearby residences. He and the car came to rest on Mrs. McCrea\u2019s lawn. Galvan was arrested immediately. The date was April 12, 1962. No narcotics were found that evening, although a search was promptly made of the scene. The next morning Mr. McCrea found a bag of heroin at one of the front comers of his house. The McCreas thought, however, the contents were marshmallows. The heroin went into the garbage, the container into a trash can. The heroin was thereafter pulled out of the garbage truck by the officers. It is not questioned that the heroin in the garbage was the same stuff as found at the corner of the McCrea house.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-21\"> The jury was entitled to conclude that the circumstances were reliable and to believe that Galvan tossed the package out in his wild flight the night before. The package was found about nine feet from the nearest track of Galvan\u2019s car. It was between a bush and a hydrant. Had the package been out in the open, it is likely it would have been soon discovered. Possibility of error always exists, but a full statement of the facts would lead the average person to think there was not much. (There was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>evidence in the record which justified the inference that Galvan might have had heroin in his car as he fled.)</p>\n<p id=\"b761-4\">In the foregoing narrative we have related what we regard as a skeleton of the facts that override appellant\u2019s specifications as to sufficiency of the evidence. We have examined two other specifications, which we find without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
