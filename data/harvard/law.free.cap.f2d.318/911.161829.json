This strategy did seem to divert the attention of appellees from the breach of warranty issue. Nevertheless, we examined the record in this case with great care, and found substantial evidence to sustain the finding of a breach of warranty, as pointed out at some length in our opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-5\">Briefly, appellant Goff now seeks an opportunity to argue the breach of warranty issue. Goff contends, and we agree, that he did argue the lack of such evidence relevant to this issue at great length in his original brief. However, he did not discuss the applicability of same to the breach of warranty issue, limiting such discussion to the fraud issue, as already mentioned. His contention in this petition \u201cInstead of failing to meet the claim that there was a breach of warranty regardless of fraud, the main brief in behalf of Goff meets that challenge squarely\u201d (pp. 14-15), is not borne out by any page references in his briefs on appeal, and the fruitless result of our re-examination of such briefs for this purpose indicates why this was not done.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-6\">Goff\u2019s contention that plaintiffs \u201cutterly failed to prove\u201d reliance upon the production warranty is untenable. The warranty clause itself expressly provided that plaintiffs \u201crely upon said warranty and representation in entering into this agreement\u201d and at least two witnesses, Cantrell and Alvey, gave testimony to support this element, as pointed out in our opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-8\">Furthermore, we do not consider the rules (1) that findings of fact of the trial court must be sustained unless clearly erroneous (Rule 52(a), F.R.Civil P.) and (2) that the decision below must be affirmed, if correct, even though the court may have relied on a wrong reason, are \u201cpurely arbitrary rules,\u201d as appellant Goff now contends. Both are well established, frequently applied, principles of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-9\">We also desire to say that neither the District Court\u2019s opinion nor the record in this case called for the over-zealous, intemperate language employed by appellants\u2019 counsel in criticizing the decision of the Trial Court, both in this petition as well as in his briefs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-10\">The petition for rehearing is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
