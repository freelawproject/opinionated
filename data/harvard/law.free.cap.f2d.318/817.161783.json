The labeling of the drug suggested that its ingredient is adequate and effective in weight reduction and appetite control. But these representations were found to be false and misleading under \u00a7 502(a) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 352(a), by Judge Meaney, D.C.N.J., in a seizure suit between the same parties in the case before us, which is the action for an injunction, United States v. 60 28-Capsule Bottles, more or less, etc., D.C.N.J., 211 F.Supp. 207. Judge Bruchhausen held that Judge Meaney\u2019s determination was <em>res judicata </em>on the \u201cfalse and misleading\u201d issue and granted the government\u2019s motion for an injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>We think Judge Bruchhausen was entitled to rely on Judge Meaney\u2019s findings, and we affirm his order. Since the district court\u2019s order expressly provides that the court shall retain jurisdiction \u201cfor the purpose of enforcing or modifying\u201d its decree, the parties will be able to make any motions they deem fit in the light of the outcome of the appeal from Judge Meaney\u2019s decision taken to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
