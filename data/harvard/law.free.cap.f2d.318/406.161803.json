Petitioner, a prisoner in the Kentucky State Penitentiary at Eddyville, Kentucky, sought, by his petition for habeas corpus, an order directing Kentucky prison authorities to bring him before a Federal Grand Jury so he could give evidence of his knowledge of some undefined claims of violation of the tax laws of the United States by undisclosed persons. No Grand Jury has been convened to consider the subject of this petitioner\u2019s claimed knowledge. The appeal to this Court is without merit and completely frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-18\">Now, therefore, it is ordered that the judgment of the District Court be, and it is, hereby affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
