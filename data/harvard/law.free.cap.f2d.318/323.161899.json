The case was tried before the District Court of Montana sitting without a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">Appellants contend that the court\u2019s decision was contrary to the evidence and the law. We do not agree. There was ample evidence to support all of the court\u2019s findings of fact and the conclusions of law based thereon were proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">We adopt as our own the excellent detailed opinion of District Judge William J.
