In the case of Waldon the principal contention is that statements made after his arrest and before preliminary hearing were erroneously received in evidence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In the case of Rogers the principal ground advanced for reversal is also the admission in evidence of statements of the accused, said to be the fruit of an arrest without warrant or probable cause. We are satisfied, however, that the arrest was authorized, so that this objection to the evidence cannot be sustained. As to Waldon\u2019s objection it was not made below; and the circumstances of neither case call upon us to exercise our discretionary authority to resort to Fed.R. Crim.P. 52(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-18\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b272-11\">. The sentences of two to seven years imprisonment on each of the two counts are concurrent as to Waldon who was found guilty of both charges. Rogers, who was found guilty only of robbery, was also sentenced for a period of imprisonment of two to seven years.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b272-19\">. It is also contended that the evidence was insufficient to support the verdict but we are satisfied a question for the jury arose from the evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
