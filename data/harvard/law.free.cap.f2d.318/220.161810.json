D.C. Code \u00a7\u00a7 22-1801, 22-2202. The question is whether in the circumstances of this case it was reversible error by reason of the Jencks Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3500, for the District Court to fail to inspect certain notes made by the Assistant United States Attorney during an interview with a government witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-25\">In cross-examination appellant\u2019s counsel, not his present counsel, showed some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>interest in seeing the prosecutor\u2019s notes. The prosecutor said, \u201cI made certain notes, Your Honor, but I did not read them back.\u201d This colloquy followed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-5\">\u201cThe Court: But you did not make [take?], a detailed statement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-6\">\u201cMr. Murphy [the prosecutor]: No, Your Honor. I have the notes right here, if you want to examine them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-7\">\u201cThe Court: I do not want to examine them. Do you want to examine them, Mr. Garbis?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-8\">\u201cMr. Garbis [appellant\u2019s counsel]: No, Mr. Murphy\u2019s word is good enough for me, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-9\">\u201cThe Court: All right.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-10\">Since appellant abandoned his previous suggestion that he would like to see the notes, and did not ask the court to examine them, the court was under no obligation to do so. United States v. Annunziato, 293 F.2d 373, 382 (2d Cir. 1961), cert. denied, 368 U.S. 919, 82 S.Ct. 240, 7 L.Ed.2d 134 (1961); United States v. Farley, 292 F.2d 789, 792 (2d Cir. 1961) , cert. denied, 369 U.S. 857, 82 S.Ct. 937, 8 L.Ed.2d 15 (1962); Ogden v. United States, 303 F.2d 724, 736 (9th Cir. 1962) . Cf. Scales v.

United States, 115 U.S.App.D.C. -, 317 F.2d 150. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3500(b) provides: \u201cAfter a witness called by the United States has testified on direct examination, the court shall, <em>on motion of the defendant, </em>order the United States to produce any statement (as hereinafter defined) * * (Emphasis added.) We do not reach the question whether the prosecutor\u2019s notes were a \u201cstatement\u201d within the meaning <em>of 18 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 3500.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-16\">Counsel we appointed argue that because this case involves a key witness no motion or demand was necessary. In the circumstances above set forth we cannot agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-17\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
