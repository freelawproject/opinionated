The subject matter is mechanical pencils.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-26\">The sole issue is whether Smith has the \u201cright to make\u201d the single count of the interference,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-27\">\u201c1. A pencil tip comprising a hollow sheath, a pencil body engaging said sheath and leaving an intervening chamber, a plastic sleeve of continuous annular cross-section disposed within said sheath, an external flange on said sleeve <em>substantially occupying </em>said chamber, and inwardly projecting splines integral with said sleeve.\u201d [Emphasis ours.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ABe\">Smith\u2019s right to make the count depends entirely on the meaning to be ascribed to the words \u201csubstantially occupying.\u201d The examiner, passing on a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>motion to dissolve on the, ground Smith has no right to make the count, held that the count reads on Smith\u2019s disclosure. The board found the count, with respect to the word \u201coccupying,\u201d to be ambiguous and held that under that circumstance it was necessary to go to the patent in which the count originated to determine its meaning, citing In re Nicolson, 49 F.2d 961, 18 CCPA 1468, Neumair v. Malocsay, 77 F.2d 622, 22 CCPA 1349, Pelzer v. Weaver, 97 F.2d 166, 25 CCPA 1232, and, having determined that meaning, found that it does not read on Smith\u2019s disclosure, wherefore he could not make the count.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">To understand the issue it is necessary to visualize the two disclosures involved. The relevant structure is that of the lead-gripping tip or end portion of the pencil.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">Wehn\u2019s pencil consists of an upper body with a threaded cavity in its lower end into which an externally threaded sheath or tip can be screwed. The threaded part of the sheath is shorter than the cavity in the body so that when the aforesaid parts are screwed together there is \u201ca substantial chamber 18 intervening between the sheath 13 and the body 7.\u201d This is the \u201cchamber\u201d of the count. Into the tip or sheath a polyethylene sleeve is inserted, which sleeve has a flange at its top. The lead passes through this sleeve and is gripped at its lower end when the tapered nose of the sleeve is forced into the frusto-eonical opening in the sheath. The important structure here, however, is the relationship of the flange on the sleeve to the chamber in the body, above the threaded end of the sheath which screws into the body. The specific disclosure of the Wehn specification underlying the critical language of the count is the following :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-6\">\u201cAt its upper end, the sleeve 24 is provided with an enlarged circular cylindrical flange 27 of a free [i. e., unclamped] diameter <em>slightly less than that of the chamber </em>18 and of a free length <em>slightly greater than that of the chamber. </em>When the body 7 and the sheath 13 are screwed together the flange 27 is slightly deformed and firmly clamped or gripped in axial position against dis-lodgement. The slight deformation of the clamped flange 27 tends to extrude the flange radially outward into <em>some </em>of the remaining volume of the chamber 18. The entire sleeve 24 is <em>well anchored against substantial axial or rotary displacement, </em>although it can readily be removed and replaced by disassembly of the body and sheath.\u201d [Emphasis ours.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">It is thus evident to us that when Wehn said in his claim that his sleeve had a flange \u201csubstantially occupying said chamber\u201d he meant that the sleeve substantially <em>filled up </em>the chamber.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-9\">Smith discloses a mechanical pencil type of holder for soft marking materials such as crayons and cosmetic sticks. It has, like Wehn, main body and tip portions which screw together in such fashion as to leave a chamber. Smith\u2019s soft writing or marking element is encased in a protective rigid plastic sleeve which has a flange at its upper end. This flange is located in the chamber but it is not clamped therein. On the contrary, the axial length of the chamber is several times the thickness of the flange so that the sleeve can be projected and retracted when the feeding mechanism of the pencil is operated so as to place the marker in writing position or withdraw it for protection. When this occurs, the flange moves up and down in the chamber. As shown in the drawings, the diameter of the flange is such that it has adequate clearance from the wall of the chamber to permit this freedom of movement. It is thus evident to us that Smith\u2019s flange \u201coccupies\u201d the chamber in the sense of <em>being in it, </em>but not in the sense of filling it up. The question is whether this is \u201csubstantially occupying\u201d the chamber.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-10\">The board and the examiner both had recourse to Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary, 2nd ed., defining \u201coccupy\u201d as \u201cto take up, <em>or </em>have place in, the extent, room, space, * * * of.\u201d (Our emphasis.) The examiner found that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>Smith\u2019s flange met the \u201chaving place in\u201d part of the definition, and hence that it occupied the chamber. He said, \u201cIf [the Smith flange is] \u2018occupying\u2019, [the Smith chamber] the count limitation \u2018substantially occupying\u2019 necessarily is met.\u201d The board refused to accept this judgment, saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-5\">\u201cIt is clear from the above [definition] that the word \u2018occupy\u2019 has two meanings, as indicated by the use of the word \u2018or\u2019 in the definition quoted. The ambiguity is further evident in the fact that one of the meanings describes Wehn\u2019s structure wherein the sleeve is held from moving while the other describes Smith\u2019s structure wherein the sleeve is permitted to move from a retracted to a projected position and vice versa. In such a situation, the law is clear. In re Nicolson [49 F.2d 961], 18 CCPA 1468, * * * states:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-6\">\u201c \u2018Furthermore, the rule is well established that where the terms of a count are ambiguous or susceptible of more than one construction, and the count is copied from the claim of a patent, the one copying the claim is bound by the meaning intended by the patentee, as shown by his disclosure. Tracy v. Leslie, 14 App.D.C. 126, 87 O.G. 891; Podlesak v. McInnerney, 26 App.D.C. 399, 120 O.G. 2127.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">\u201c * * * The meaning of the patentee Wehn is clear; the flange by substantially filling and taking up the space of the chamber anchors the sleeve against axial displacement * * *. Given this meaning * * \u2018substantially occupying\u2019 is not supported by Smith\u2019s disclosure. Because of the principle of law above stated, we believe he [the examiner] was wrong in not accepting the meaning intended by the patentee, and in accepting the one which would read upon structures not anchoring the sleeve, and thus departing from the purpose and function of the combination claimed by Wehn.\u201d We consider the foregoing to be sound reasoning. It will be noted that in the above-quoted passage the board was discussing only the word \u201coccupying\u201d in the critical limitation of the claim. But it went further.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-10\">The examiner had said, as above indicated, that if Smith\u2019s flange \u201coccupied\u201d the chamber, it followed that it \u201csubstantially\u201d occupied it. We deem this to be a non sequitur. Apparently the board also disagreed with this reasoning for it gave separate consideration to the significance of the word \u201csubstantially,\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-11\">\u201cMoreover, the term \u2018substantially\u2019 appears to be more suitably coupled with a measure of amount such as filling and taking up the space of, rather than a statement of location. In our edition of Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary (195Q) the second definition of \u2018occupy\u2019 is similar to that quoted by the Primary Examiner but continues, \u2018to fill; as, the camp <em>occupies </em>five acres.\u2019 It would be natural to say, \u2018The camp substantially occupies (fills) five acres,\u2019 meaning that it takes up the space of about five acres; but to say, \u2018The employee substantially occupies Room 100\u2019 is, at least, unusual, awkward, and inapt.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-12\">For those reasons we too agree that the word \u201csubstantially\u201d makes the meaning of the phrase \u201csubstantially occupying\u201d in the Wehn claim all the more clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-13\">The first point of appellant\u2019s argument is that the critical phrase does not render the count ambiguous, wherefore there should be no resort to the Wehn patent. We cannot agree with appellant. For the reasons amply stated by the board and quoted above, there are two possible meanings to the word \u201coccupy\u201d in the count. \u201cAmbiguous\u201d is defined in Webster\u2019s New Collegiate Dictionary, 2nd ed., meaning 2, as \u201cCapable of being understood in two or more possible senses; equivocal.\u201d Appellant refers us to the necessity, under another well established rule, of giving an inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>ference count the broadest possible reasonable construction, i. e., to cover as many diverse structures as possible, within reason, apparently believing that if this is done the words \u201csubstantially occupying,\u201d even as Wehn appears to-have intended them, will cease to mean substantially filling up because Wehn\u2019s pencil could be made to function even if his flange did not substantially fill up his chamber. Appellant urges -that the count language is <em>broad </em>enough to read on the structures of both parties but that it does not follow therefrom that it is ambiguous. Of course it does not, but that is not conclusive either.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">We do not believe that appellant can remove the applicability of the ambiguous count interpretation rule by application of the broad construction rule. It seems to us that the broader the interpretation is here the more certain it becomes that the count is ambiguous. It would be possible, we think, by emphasizing the word \u201csubstantially,\u201d to give the count a narrower interpretation according to which it would <em>not </em>read on Smith\u2019s disclosure, following reasoning similar to that of the board in the second quotation above from its opinion. But applying the broad interpretation rule, as appellant wishes us to do-, the count then can cover both Smith and Wehn only by giving it one meaning when applied to Wehn and a different meaning when applied to Smith \u2014 the \u201cfill up\u201d meaning in the former and the \u201cbeing in\u201d meaning in the latter. This is clearly ambiguity and that meaning applicable in the patent where the count originated must be applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">We also think that there is another rule applicable here. In Segall v. Sims et al., 276 F.2d 661, 47 CCPA 886, a case wherein we applied the ambiguous count interpretation rule, we also said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqc\">\u201cWhen an applicant copies a claim from a patent, he must show that he is entitled to make the claim. All limitations in the copied claim will be considered material in determining applicant\u2019s right to make the claim, <em>and doubts arising as to applicant\u2019s right to make the claim must be resolved against him. </em>[Authorities cited.]\u201d [Our emphasis.] The decision of the board is affirmed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aeo\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b373-13\">. Wehn is involved in this interference on his patent No. 2,844,125 granted July 22, 1958, on application Ser.

Appellee Wehn argued before the board, in addition to the point here argued, that there was no \u201cinterference in fact.\u201d This argument was based on the contention that claim 2 of the Wehn patent was materially altered by Smith when the word \u201cplastic\u201d was substituted for the word \u201cpolyethylene\u201d of the patent claim. This was Smith\u2019s <em>sole </em>modification of claim 2 of Wehn\u2019s patent. The board disagreed with Wehn and denied a motion to dissolve on the ground of \u201cno interference in fact.\u201d Wehn says in his brief in this court that he has \u201cbowed to that result,\u201d \u201cthough still a disbeliever.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
