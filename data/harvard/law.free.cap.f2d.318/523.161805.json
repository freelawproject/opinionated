During the prosecution years he claimed as his only source of income the newsstand and gift shop which he operated, known as \u201cLee\u2019s News.\u201d Using the net worth method of proof, the prosecution introduced evidence of cash on hand, various automobiles of which the purchase price was attributable to the defendant, legal fees, life insurance premiums, and miscellaneous personal living expenses \u2014 all of which tended to show funds at his disposal indicating that a substantial tax was due and owing from him for the years involved. The government contended that the indicated deficiencies in the income reported arose from gambling and bookmaking activities \u2014 a taxable source of income \u2014 and pointed to defendant\u2019s failure to keep books, his excessive use of currency, and the concealment of assets by placing several of the automobiles purchased by defendant in the name of relatives as proof of the necessary element of willfullness. The primary theory of defense below was that the net worth increases which the government had shown were due to the receipt of cash loans from defendant\u2019s parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-14\">On appeal the defendant argues that the district court erred in permitting Special Agent O\u2019Sullivan to testify regarding statements male to him by defendant\u2019s wife. Defendant contends that admission of this testimony was in violation of spousal privilege. While we agree that the testimony in question presents some interesting questions as to the application of both the spousal privilege rule and the hearsay rule, we need not concern ourselves with them here. For Judge Brennan had second thoughts about this aspect of Special Agent O'Sullivan\u2019s testimony and, on his own motion, ordered the items in the net worth account based upon the wife\u2019s statements stricken from the record. Defendant now seems to claim that Judge Brennan failed to strike all the items on which the wife\u2019s statements had bearing. But the effect on the net worth statement of striking the testimony was determined by a stipulation to which the defense counsel agreed; and he then made no claim that other items should also have been stricken. Thus he has no ground to challenge the failure to include such other items in the exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-15\">Defendant also complains of the use in evidence of his arrests for bookmaking in 1955 and 1958, his conviction for those offenses, and the payment by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>him in 1955 of a $1,000 fine. The government may have made generous use of defendant\u2019s vulnerability from his gambling activities, but this was part of the story and the case. Any prejudice here was dispelled by Judge Brennan\u2019s instructions to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\">While we believe the prosecutor did overstep the bounds in summation\u2014 calling defendant a leech and accusing him of ruining a young law student relative\u2019s career by having the boy hold cash for him \u2014 we do not feel that these comments were sufficiently prejudicial to warrant reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
