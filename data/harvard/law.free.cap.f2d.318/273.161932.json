At trial, the attorney who represented Ross asked for the production of certain notes. The judge said to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>the witness, an officer, \u201cI\u2019ll give the counsel whatever you wrote down,\u201d and copies of such notes as had been prepared were made available. The judge afforded counsel an opportunity to examine them.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">Appellant\u2019s trial counsel (not his present attorney), did not join<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in the Ross request. It is now contended that somehow the judge erred in not more specifically inquiring into the possible bearing of the notes on this appellant\u2019s case. We find the contention without merit, for there is no showing that there were in existence and not produced any statements coming within the Jencks Act.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">Appellant further contends that the trial court erred in failing to order the production of a transcript of testimony given before the grand jury by a juvenile. The latter was said to have been implicated in the offense and had been called as a witness by the Government. There was no showing that the testimony of the juvenile at trial was inconsistent with whatever he may have said before the grand jury, a summary of the notes of which was tendered to counsel for Ross. Ross made no effort to show a \u201cparticularized need\u201d for the production of the minutes.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Appellant\u2019s trial attorney did not join in the Ross motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">In any event, we find no basis for a conclusion that the trial judge abused his discretion<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> in refusing to order production of the grand jury minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"AU2\">Afirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b321-27\">. Ross did not appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b322-9\">. So far as the record discloses, he may have discovered the \u201cnotes\u201d to be anything but helpful to this appellant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b322-10\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3500; and see Saunders v.

As to the problem involving the Jencks Act I add a few words. It is an open question in my mind whether a defendant is necessarily precluded on appeal from relying on the Jencks Act if he did not expressly associate himself in the matter when his co-defendant invoked the Act at the trial. Cf. United States v. Simmons, 281 F.2d 354 (2d Cir. 1960). In the present case, however, appellant was so indifferent to the matter when it was raised several times by his co-defendant, each time failing to associate himself with the position taken by his co-defendant, that I do not think he can now complain of the result.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
