Following our. regular practice in making a determination of these matters, we have access to the record below and have reviewed it carefully. See Juelich v. United States, 5 Cir., 1963, 316 F.2d 726. We are of the opinion that no useful purpose would be served by first allowing Petitioner\u2019s appeal to this Court and then setting the case down for argument. The Court below denied Petitioner\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion on the ground that the \u201cfiles and records conclusively show\u201d that he is entitled to no relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-21\">Petitioner alleges with sufficient factual particularity that he was mentally incompetent, not only at the time of the commission of the offense, but also at the time of trial under his plea of not guilty. Twenty-two months after his arrest (and following his sentence) Petitioner was diagnosed as a schizophrenic paranoid personality and is presently confined in a medical center for federal prisoners. Nothing in the record refutes these allegations. Indeed, the record (apart from the \u00a7 2255 motion) is completely silent as to the mental capacity of Petitioner as of these various times. As we have pointed out in the many cases catalogued in Porter v. United States, 5 Cir., 1962, 298 F.2d 461, 464, a hearing as to the appropriate issues is required unless \u2014 in the plain words of the statute \u2014 \u201cthe files and records of the case conclusively show that the [Petitioner] is entitled to no relief.\u201d Like many other cases presenting a question of mental competency, this case must go back for a hearing to determine fac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>tually the merit of Petitioner\u2019s contentions. Gregori v. United States, 5 Cir., 1957, 243 F.2d 48; Praylow v. United States, 5 Cir., 1962, 298 F.2d 792; Hughes v. United States, 5 Cir., 1962, 303 F.2d 776; Corbett v.

United States, 5 Cir., 1959, 267 F.2d 42. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed, the judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-4\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
