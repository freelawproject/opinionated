On February 28, 1961, the Council of Oklahoma City passed, and the Mayor signed, Ordinance No. 9263 establishing a sanitary sewer district which included lands of the appellees. This ordinance was repealed by Ordinance No. 9884 enacted on September 4, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>1962. By amendment to their answer and by motion to dismiss, the appellants, as city officials, asserted that the ease became moot upon the repeal of Ordinance No. 9263. The trial court declined to dismiss and gave summary judgment for the appellees, holding that due process was denied and declaring 11 Old. St.Ann. \u00a7 277 unconstitutional. In this court the city officials forego reliance on mootness and all parties request an adjudication on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\"> A federal court can declare a state statute void for unconstitutionality only when \u201cit is called upon to adjudge the legal rights of litigants in actual controversies.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Federal courts have no power to give advisory opinions<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> or to adjudicate constitutional questions in the absence of \u201cconcrete legal issues, presented in actual cases, not abstractions.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> These principles apply to actions for declaratory judgments.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">The repeal of Ordinance No. 9263 eliminated any justiciable controversy from this case. At that time the interest of the appellees-plaintiffs in the constitutionality of the questioned Oklahoma statutes became hypothetical. One who is not affected by a statute may not question its constitutionality.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The possibility of the enactment of another similar ordinance does not change the situation because the record contains nothing to show that such action is threatened or even contemplated.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The case is moot and, in accordance with the approved practice,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the judgment is reversed and the case remanded with directions to vacate the judgment and dismiss the action.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b878-25\">. 11 Okl.St.Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 274, 277, and 278.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b879-7\">.
