He has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-22\">In an earlier motion filed by him under \u00a7 2255, petitioner requested leave to sue in forma pauperis and for appointment of counsel to represent him. The forma pauperis motion was granted. Counsel was not appointed for him. His \u00a7 2255 motion was denied.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This court, by order, on certificate of the District Court that the appeal was not taken in good faith, denied petitioner\u2019s motions to appeal in forma pauperis and for appointment of counsel. The Supreme Court denied certiorari. 369 U.S. 825, 82 S.Ct. 840, 7 L.Ed.2d 789 (1962). The proceeding at bar followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-23\">In this second motion at bar under \u00a7 2255, petitioner claims violation of his constitutional rights in a wire tapping violation of the Federal Communications Act, unlawful arrest and search, the knowing use of perjured testimony, the manner in which the Government made its proof, and failure to allege and prove venue. This motion was denied without hearing and without counsel on the ground that it was the \u201csecond or successive motion for similar relief.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This court granted petitioner leave to appeal in forma pauperis, and appointed counsel for him.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-24\">On March 18, 1963, this court filed a unanimous opinion affirming the District Court\u2019s decision. Since that opinion was filed, however, the Supreme Court filed its opinion in Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335, 83 S.Ct. 792, 9 L.Ed.2d 799 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>(1963). It held that the Fourteenth Amendment requires the states to follow the federal rule under the Sixth Amendment and appoint counsel for defendants unable to employ counsel in criminal prosecutions unless the right is competently and intelligently waived. A majority of this court, on petitioner\u2019s motion, has granted a rehearing. Our opinion of March 18, 1963, is hereby withdrawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-4\">Petitioner was effectually denied appeal from the decision on his first motion under \u00a7 2255, and since he has been enabled to appeal from the decision in this second proceeding, we think justice requires that we consider the original decision upon which the decision at bar rests.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-5\">In McCartney v. United States, 311 F.2d 475 (7th Cir. 1963), this court held that the appointment of counsel in \u00a7 2255 proceedings is discretionary. Neither the District Court, nor this court in denying the appeal, however, had the benefit of the Supreme Court holding in Gideon v. Wainwright when petitioner\u2019s motion for counsel, in the first \u00a7 2255 proceeding, was presented before them. If that decision had then been available, there might have been no basis for denial, on the ground given, of a hearing under petitioner\u2019s second motion, subject of this appeal. In the light of the Gideon case, it is our opinion, since no good reason appears why petitioner should not have had the aid of counsel in presenting his first motion, that the order at bar should be reversed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We agree with counsel for petitioner on this appeal that the decision at bar was more or less mechanical inasmuch as it was the \u201csecond or successive\u201d motion and that it was on his first motion under \u00a7 2255 that he was entitled to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-6\">The order at bar is reversed, and the cause is remanded with directions to reconsider the petition at bar as an original petition under \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b922-16\">. Petitioner\u2019s first \u00a7 2255 motion alleged that he was denied constitutional rights in the following particulars: defective indictment; unlawful arrest and search; ineffective counsel; no opportunity to confront witnesses against him; and unfair trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b922-25\">. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 provides, in part, as follows: \u201cThe sentencing court shall not be required to entertain a second or successive motion for similar relief on behalf of the same prisoner.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b923-7\">. The precise holding in Gideon does not require this result. The holding there involved a state conviction, not a motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. We are convinced, however, that the Supreme Court\u2019s view of the right to counsel reflected in the Gideon opinion indicates the result we have reached.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b923-12\">ENOCH, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"Ao6\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"A5gI\">Petitioner was tried in the United States District Court, Case No. 59 CR 208, on a one-count indictment charging that he fraudulently and knowingly received, concealed and facilitated the transportation and concealment of approximately 12 ounces of heroin known to him to be imported into the United States contrary to law. After trial by jury, he was convicted and sentenced to serve a term of 15 years and to pay a fine of $10,000 and costs. He was represented by counsel of his own choice at that trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-13\">He appealed his conviction to this Court, Appeal No. 12903, (opinion reported at 7 Cir., 282 F.2d 871). He was represented in his appeal by counsel of his own choice. This Court affirmed the judgment of conviction. In the opinion, Chief Judge Hastings speaking for this Court, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b923-14\">\u201cThe entire record amply demonstrates to our satisfaction that defendant received a fair trial and that there was overwhelming evidence of his guilt. Defendant\u2019s obvious effort to find reversible error stretches judicial credulity too far.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ai0\">The United States Supreme Court denied certiorari. 365 U.S. 883, 81 S.Ct. 1033, 6 L.Ed.2d 193.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-15\">The District Judge who presided at petitioner\u2019s trial granted petitioner leave to file his initial and amended motions, in forma pauperis, under Title 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, to vacate the judgment etc. Petioner alleged grounds for relief as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b923-16\">1. The indictment fails to charge a crime.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b923-17\">2. The government failed to allege and prove venue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b924-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>3 There was inadequate proof of the possession of narcotics.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b924-4\">4. The government failed to call a material witness.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b924-5\">Petitioner also asked for appointment of counsel to represent him. Counsel was not appointed. The District Judge denied the motion on September 8, 1961. On November 24, 1961, he denied application to appeal in forma pauperis on the ground that the appeal was not taken in good faith. Petitioner then sought leave of this Court to appeal in forma pauperis. Such leave was denied December 8, 1961. The United States Supreme Court again denied certiorari. 369 U.S. 825, 82 S.Ct. 840, 7 L.Ed.2d 789 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b924-6\">Petitioner filed a second motion, and supplements thereto, to vacate his sentence, under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, in which he argued substantially the same issues, although he did not set them out under the same headings. The same District Judge denied the motion on the ground that he was not obliged to entertain a second or successive motion, referring to the initial \u00a7 2255 proceeding and to the opinion on the appeal from the original trial, reported at 282 F.2d 871.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-7\">When the District Judge ruled on the petitioner\u2019s original motion under \u00a7 2255, he had before him the files and records of the previous trial, at which he had presided, and the records of the appeal therefrom. The learned Judge found from his study of those files and records that petitioner was conclusively shown to be entitled to no relief.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> When the second motion under \u00a7 2255 was presented, the District Court denied it, pursuant to the statute.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b924-8\">Petitioner appealed that decision to this Court, in forma pauperis. At his request counsel was appointed to represent petitioner in his appeal, No. 13846. The sole contested issue advanced was :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b924-13\">\u201cWas the denial of Appellant\u2019s motion<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> without the appointment of counsel, who could properly present such motion on his behalf, such an abuse of discretion by the court below as to warrant reversal of the order denying such motion?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b924-14\">This Court affirmed the District Court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-15\">On March 29, 1963, petitioner pro se filed his petition for rehearing based, in large part, on the alleged inadequacy of the counsel appointed by this Court to represent him on his appeal No. 13846. Neither petitioner nor his counsel have invited this Court\u2019s attention to the U. S. Supreme Court decision in Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335, 83 S.Ct. 792, 9 L.Ed.2d 799, handed down March 18, 1963.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-16\">However, solely in reliance on Gideon, the majority have granted rehearing in this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-17\">As the majority concedes, the precise holding in Gideon does not require that petitioners must have counsel appointed for them in all \u00a7 2255 proceedings. The Supreme Court held that the indigent Mr. Gideon, who was obliged to defend himself in his state court trial on a felony charge, was entitled to have assistance of counsel. Mr. Gideon had requested appointment of counsel and had been told that, under the laws of the State of Florida, the Trial Court could appoint counsel to represent him, or any other indigent defendant, only when he was charged with a capital offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-18\">The Supreme Court in Gideon, merely abolished the distinction between criminal trials for capital and noncapital <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>felonies, with respect to appointment of counsel for indigent defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-5\">As Mr. Justice Harlan said in his concurring opinion, (372 U.S. page 351, 83 S.Ct. page 801) this ruling \u201cdoes no more than to make explicit something that has long since been foreshadowed in our decisions.\u201d The Supreme Court has often held that, in the light of particular circumstances in a case, denial of counsel amounted to denial of due process. He also notes that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b925-6\">\u201cWhether the rule should extend to <em>all </em>criminal cases need not now be decided.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b925-7\">Under the circumstances, it seems to me almost presumptuous for this Court to predict that the Supreme Court would hold that all indigents proceeding under \u00a7 2255 are entitled to have counsel appointed for them, thus nullifying the clear and unambiguous provisions of \u00a7 2255 respecting study of the motion, files and records of the case to ascertain whether these \u201cconclusively show that the prisoner is entitled to no relief.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b925-8\">I cannot but feel that my brethren have overstated the effect of Gideon, which at most prescribes for the state courts in felony cases the old principle, long honored in the District Courts, that indigent defendants are entitled to assistance of counsel in all criminal trials. Process of a motion under \u00a7 2255 is not a criminal trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-9\">As indicated above, the \u00a7 2255 motion now before us is just such a \u201csecond or successive motion for similar relief on behalf of the same prisoner\u201d as is proscribed by the statute. I am strongly of the opinion that the District Court should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-10\">I have the conviction that no right whatsoever of a defendant should be impinged upon for reasons of expediency. However, it is my belief that \u00a7 2255 must be used as a vehicle for securing further consideration by the Trial Court only when \u201cthe motion and the files and records of the case\u201d do not \u201cconclusively show that the prisoner is entitled to no relief,\u201d and not to secure improper review of an appeal free from error. After handling a great many of these cases, I am fearful that the convicted criminal who has already had his day in court is being given far more consideration than the honorable law-abiding citizen. A strict procedure under \u00a7 2255 would deny no defendant his lawful rights. It would eliminate a host of eases which now clog our court calendars to no good purpose, delaying attention to urgent matters more worthy of consideration, and thus tending to promote a lack of respect for law and order amongst our people.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b924-9\">. Section 2255 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b924-10\">\u201cUnless the motion and the files and records of the case conclusively show that the prisoner is entitled to no relief, the court shall cause notice thereof to be served upon the United States attorney, grant a prompt hearing thereon, determine the issues and make findings of fact and conclusions of law with respect thereto.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b924-20\">. Section 2255 also provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b924-21\">\u201cThe sentencing court shall not be required to entertain a second or successive motion for similar relief on behalf of the same prisoner.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b924-22\">.
