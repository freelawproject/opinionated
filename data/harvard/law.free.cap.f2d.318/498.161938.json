It may be assumed that a court always has jurisdiction to keep house and control of its records. The parties appear to be agreeable that the district court transfer the case to the Superior Court for the State of Alaska. If the district court should choose to transfer the case to the state judicial system, questions of jurisdiction, if any, would be for the state side of the street and not the federal in view of the posture of the case.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
