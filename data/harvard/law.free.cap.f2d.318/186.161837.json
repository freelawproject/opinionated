In receiving the plea the District Court, Judge McGarraghy sitting, was careful to inquire of defendant, who was present in open court with counsel, as to the defendant\u2019s comprehension of the nature and consequences of the plea. This occurred June 25, 1962. On September 25, 1962, other counsel filed in the District Court a motion to set aside the plea and to order appellant committed to St. Elizabeth\u2019s Hospital or other mental hospital to determine whether he \u201cis of unsound mind or is mentally incompetent so as to be unable to understand the proceedings against him or properly to assist in his own defense.\u201d The support for the motion was an affidavit of the wife of the appellant. The motion was denied; and this appeal from the denial order followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-10\">The motion and affidavit are insufficient to have required the court under Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(d), or otherwise, to take the action sought by the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-13\">The sentence of the appellant was made with a recommendation by the court that he be committed to an institution in which he would receive treatment for narcotics addiction, and the provisions of 24 D.C.Code \u00a7 302 are available for transfer of the appellant from jail to a mental institution if appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-14\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
