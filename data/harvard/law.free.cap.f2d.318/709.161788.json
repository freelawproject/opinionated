Appeal was taken to the Construction Contract Appeals Board which also denied the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>Plaintiff complains, though agreeing with the Government that there are no genuine issues of fact in dispute, that the Veterans Administration\u2019s procedures adopted in its case denied it procedural due process and denied it its constitutional rights, violated the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 et seep; and the final decision adverse to it was not supported <em>by substantial </em>evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">We hold, as Judge Cashin held, that there is no merit to appellant\u2019s claims, and we affirm the district court judgment on the opinion below.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
