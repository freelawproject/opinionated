The only point raised on this appeal is that the value of a television set, the subject of the charge, was not shown to have been $100.00 or over,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and that, consequently, appellant should only have been convicted of the crime of petit larceny [Title 22, \u00a7 2202, D.C.Code (1961)].</p>\n<p id=\"b253-14\">Appellant claims that the only Government witness who testified as to value, and who was the manager of the Philco showroom from which the television set was stolen, was not qualified as an expert as to value; and that, therefore, there was not sufficient evidence of the value of the set to justify a conviction of the crime of grand larceny.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-16\">Our examination of the record convinces us that, as held by the District Judge, the witness was properly qualified and that his evidence, if believed by the jury (as it apparently was), was sufficient to prove value in excess of $100.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-17\">It follows that the judgment of the District Court must be and is</p>\n<p id=\"b253-18\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b253-15\">.
