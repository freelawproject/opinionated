Thereafter, he obtained an order from Supreme Court permitting the filing of the summons and complaint nunc pro tunc on or before December 31, 1992, prompting this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-8\">We affirm. Since this action was commenced prior to July 1, 1992, the original filing law (CPLR former 306-a, added by L 1991, ch 166, \u00a7 381) remains applicable <em>(see, De Maria v Smith, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>197 AD2d 114, 116; Blair and Aloe, <em>New Commencement By Filing Law: A Practitioner\u2019s Survival Guide, </em>NYLJ, June 26, 1992, at 1, col 1). Under that statute the application for a nunc pro tunc order was strictly pro forma as it provided that \"[w]here a summons in an action * * * has not been filed within [30 days after service is complete], the court upon application shall order the filing thereof nunc pro tunc\u201d <em>(see, </em>CPLR former 306-a [c], as added by L 1991, ch 166, \u00a7 381; <em>see also, </em>1 Weinstein-Korn-Miller, NY Civ Prac ]j 306-a.01).</p>\n<p id=\"b921-4\">Mikoll, J. P., Crew III, Yesawich Jr. and Peters, JJ., concur. Ordered that the order is affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
