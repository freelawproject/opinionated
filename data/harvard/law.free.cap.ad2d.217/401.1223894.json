Rather, any possible prejudice to defendant was obviated by the witness\u2019 explanation that the reference was merely an interview technique, and by the court\u2019s repeated instructions to the jury to draw no adverse inference against a defendant from evidence presented in connection with a codefendant, including alleged statements. Further, any error must be considered harmless beyond a reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>able doubt in light of the fact that defendant\u2019s own statements regarding his participation in the crimes charged were supported by an abundance of corroborating evidence, including the testimony of eyewitnesses regarding the details of the robbery, and one victim\u2019s identification of defendant in a lineup as someone who looked familiar from the robbery <em>(see, People v Hamlin, </em>71 NY2d 750, 758).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">The trial court also properly excluded the statement of a nontestifying accused accomplice that allegedly contained exculpatory evidence regarding defendant, on the ground that there was no showing that the statement in question, clearly intended to exculpate the declarant, enjoyed the presumed reliability of a statement against penal interest <em>(see, People v Maerling, </em>46 NY2d 289, 295).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">In deciding the appeal of codefendant Ricardo Nova, this Court rejected defendant\u2019s claim alleging impropriety in connection with the jury instructions <em>(People v Nova, </em>198 AD2d 193, <em>lv denied </em>83 NY2d 808). Finally, as the Medical Examiner\u2019s audiotape of the autopsy herein does not constitute <em>Rosario </em>material, the People were not required to provide it to the defense <em>(see, People v Washington, </em>86 NY2d 189).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">We perceive no abuse of discretion in sentencing.
