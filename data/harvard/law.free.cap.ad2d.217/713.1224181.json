County Court subsequently denied defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw his plea. Defendant then moved to settle the transcripts of the proceedings based upon several amendments that he proposed. In opposition the People submitted, <em>inter alia, </em>the affidavit of the official court reporter who transcribed the minutes of the proceedings in question certifying that the transcripts were accurate. County Court settled the transcripts as certified by the court reporter. Given these circumstances, we find no abuse of County Court\u2019s power to settle the transcripts and to decide any controversy relating to them in its denial of defendant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">Mikoll, J. P., Crew III, Casey, Yesawich Jr. and Spain, JJ., concur. Ordered that the order is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
