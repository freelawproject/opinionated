We disagree. Defendant\u2019s prior acts of violence against the victim were relevant to the issues of intent and absence of mistake or accident and on the defense of justification <em>(see, People v Wright, </em>167 AD2d 959, 960, <em>lv denied </em>77 NY2d 845; <em>People v Plunkett, </em>158 AD2d 949, <em>lv denied </em>75 NY2d 969; <em>People v Sellers, </em>135 AD2d 590), and the probative value of that evidence outweighed its prejudicial effect <em>(see, People v Hudy, </em>73 NY2d 40, 55).
