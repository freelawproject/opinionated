After the trial judge has said, \u201cNo,\u201d is there some mechanical appellate test for materiality that may override the trial judge\u2019s discretion, a discretion rooted in his sense or \u201cfeel\u201d of the case over which he has presided? What does appellate deference really amount to? Does the \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d standard mean something more predictable than whatever the appellate court wants it to mean on a particular occasion? What are the limits that an appellate court may not transgress in finding an abuse of discretion?</p>\n<p id=\"b706-10\">The Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b706-11\">The appellant, Kevin Eugene Jackson, was convicted by a Somerset County jury, presided over by Judge Daniel M. Long, of two counts of sexual child abuse. In this appeal he contends</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>1. that Judge Long erroneously failed to grant his motion for a new trial;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-4\">2. that Judge Long erred in responding to two questions submitted by the jury in the course of its deliberations; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-5\">3. that Judge Long, at the sentencing stage, erroneously considered 1) a hearsay statement by David Dunn contained in the Presentence Investigation Report and 2) a letter submitted to the court by David Dunn which had not been provided to the defense in advance of sentencing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">The appellant and Kimberly Milbourne were married in 1992 and divorced in 1996. Their daughter, the victim of the sexual child abuse in this case, was born on April 4, 1992. Both the 1996 divorce and the ensuing custody fight over the daughter were, by mutual acknowledgment, \u201ccontentious\u201d and \u201cugly.\u201d The court awarded the custody of the daughter to the mother and allowed the appellant visitation privileges on alternate weekends. Both the mother and the appellant remarried.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-8\">In 1999, the mother and her new husband moved to Virginia with the daughter in what they freely admitted was an attempt to thwart visitation by the appellant. For some extended period of time, the appellant had no meaningful visitation with his daughter. As a direct result of that situation, he retained counsel and filed 1) a petition to enforce visitation, 2) a petition to find the mother in contempt, and 3) a complaint asking for custody of his daughter. In the wake of those filings, the mother reported that her daughter had in March of 2002, just before her 10th birthday, revealed to her that the appellant had sexually abused her back when she was four or five years of age. Charges were filed, and the appellant was ultimately convicted of two counts of sexual child abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-9\">The Denial of the Motion for a New Trial</p>\n<p id=\"b707-10\">The most significant of the contentions before us is that Judge Long abused his discretion in denying the appellant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>Motion for a New Trial. At the outset of any review of whether a trial judge abused his discretion in denying a new trial motion, it is important to establish which party bears the burden of proof on the issue of whether a new trial should be awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">The Burden of Proof On a Motion for New Trial</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">It always behooves us, on any issue, to identify which party bears the burden of proof. When the evidence and the argument at a hearing on a Motion for New Trial, for instance, are so frustratingly scant that the trial judge cannot arrive at a definitive conclusion one way or the other, how does he resolve his doubt? To wit, who wins and who loses the nothing-to-nothing tie? In law, of course, there are no ties, for we have deliberately created a device called the allocation of the burden of proof for the precise purpose of avoiding ties. That party to whom the burden of proof is allocated is, by definition, the loser of what would otherwise be a tie. At a hearing on a Motion for New Trial, the burden of persuading the trial judge that such a remedy is called for is on the defendant, as the moving party.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">Writing for the Court of Appeals in <em>Argyrou v. State, </em>349 Md. 587, 609, 709 A.2d 1194 (1998), Chief Judge Bell emphatically made this allocation of the burden clear:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-8\"><em>As the proponent of the new trial motion, the petitioner had the burden of establishing, </em>among other things, that the confession was newly discovered evidence. <em>The petitioner simply failed to carry it. </em>Accordingly, the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it denied the petitioner\u2019s motion for new trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b708-9\">(Emphasis supplied). See also <em>Isley v. State, </em>129 Md.App. 611, 673-74, 743 A.2d 772 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-10\">Three Subcontentions That Defaulted</p>\n<p id=\"b708-11\">The guilty verdicts in this case were rendered on March 11, 2004. The Motion for a New Trial was filed on May 5. The first three grounds alleged in that motion were 1) that the evidence was legally insufficient to support the verdicts, 2) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>that there was no evidence to corroborate the testimony of the victim, and 3) that the verdict was contrary to the weight of the evidence. Judge Long declined to entertain those three contentions, because the motion for a new trial had been filed well beyond the 10-day period set out in Maryland Rule 4-331(a), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-5\">(a) Within Ten Days of Verdict. On motion of the defendant filed within ten days after a verdict, the court, in the interest of justice, may order a new trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">In <em>Love v. State, </em>95 Md.App. 420, 426-28, 621 A.2d 910, <em>cert. denied, </em>331 Md. 480, 628 A.2d 1067 (1993), this Court discussed the significance and the binding nature of that 10-day time limitation.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-7\">The Motion for New Trial in a criminal case, recognized by Md. Ann.Code art. 27, \u00a7 594 (1992), is controlled by the provisions of Maryland Rule 4-331. The Motion is available on three progressively narrower sets of grounds but over the course of three progressively longer time periods. <em>The shortest of time periods but the broadest of predicates is that provided by subsection (a,):</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-8\"><em>The list of possible grounds for the granting of a new trial </em>by the trial judge within ten days of the verdict <em>is virtually open-ended. ...</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-9\"><em>... </em>This broader latitude is in keeping with the provision of subsection (a) that a judge may order a new trial \u201cin the interest of justice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-10\"><em>This broad, base for awarding a new trial is tightly circumscribed by the timeliness requirement that the motion be filed \u201cwithin ten days after a verdict. \u201d </em>... <em>Trial judges, moreover, are not empowered to overlook the filing deadline.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b709-11\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-12\">Judge Long, therefore, properly declined to hear the three contentions that could only have been legitimately considered if they had been timely raised within ten days of the verdicts. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>They clearly had not been so timely raised. As we observed in <em>Love v. State, </em>95 Md.App. at 423, 621 A.2d 910:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-5\"><em>The Motion for New Trial </em>is one of the post-trial remedies. It <em>is by no means, </em>however, <em>a never-failing panacea, available whenever and however outraged justice may beckon. </em>It is designed to correct some, but not all, flaws that may have marred a trial. <em>It is limited, moreover, by rigid filing deadlines and other formal constraints.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">When Is Due Diligence Due?</p>\n<p id=\"b710-8\">The appellant, however, also raised a fourth ground for his motion. It was that of newly discovered evidence. The motion alleged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-9\">6. <em>Additionally, there is now new evidence, </em>which could not have been discovered by due diligence prior to trial. Specifically, <em>the victim has now recanted her testimony that she was abused by the Defendant. She recanted her testimony the day after the trial </em>to another family member.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-10\">7. The day after the trial, the victim stated that her mother and stepfather forced her to testify against her father. She also stated that she did not know that her father would go to jail if convicted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-11\">8. It is now clear that the witness/victim has either been threatened or coached by her mother and stepfather.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b710-12\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-13\">Of the three time periods for filing a Motion for New Trial under Rule 4-331, the narrowest in terms of its justiciable subject matter but the most generous in terms of its filing deadline is subsection (c), which provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-14\">(c) Newly discovered evidence. <em>The court may grant a new trial </em>or other appropriate relief <em>on the ground of newly discovered evidence </em>which could not have been discovered by due diligence in time to move for a new trial pursuant to section (a) of this Rule:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-15\">(1) <em>on motion filed within one year after the date the court imposed sentence </em>or the date it received a mandate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>issued by the Court of Appeals or the Court of Special Appeals, whichever is later[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b711-4\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\"><em>Love v. State, </em>95 Md.App. at 428-29, 621 A.2d 910, commented both on subsection (c)\u2019s longer period of grace for filing and on its narrower substantive base.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-6\">It is the third of the new trial provisions that is before us in this case. <em>This is a form of relief available over a far more extended period of time, one year rather than the ninety days available under subsection (b) or the ten days available under subsection (a). </em>There is, moreover, the possibility of two triggering events \u2014 the imposition of sentence or the receipt of an appellate mandate \u2014 for the running of the one-year clock, and a defendant is permitted to take advantage of the more favorable. <em>This form of relief, on the other hand, rests upon a far more narrow substantive base.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-8\"> Although the Motion for a New Trial based on newly discovered evidence was timely filed within one year of the verdicts, it nonetheless had a due diligence problem of a different nature. To justify the extended one-year filing deadline, it is required that the new evidence could not, with diligence, have been discovered within the first ten days after the verdict, so as to have permitted a more normal new trial motion pursuant to subsection (a). To wit, the extraordinarily extended filing period itself is not automatic but has to be justified by due diligence. <em>Love v. State, </em>95 Md.App. at 430, 621 A.2d 910, noted in this regard.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-9\">To qualify as \u201cnewly discovered evidence\u201d under the provisions of Rule 4-331(c), <em>it is not enough, </em>as the quotation states, <em>that the evidence have been \u201cdiscovered since the trial,\u201d Jones, </em>16 Md.App. at 477, 298 A.2d 483; <em>it is required, by the very terms of the Maryland Rule, that the evidence have been discovered more than ten days after a </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number><em>verdict so that it was no longer timely \u201cto move for a new trial pursuant to section (a) of this Rule.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">Judge Long noted what was probably an actual lack of due diligence in failing to bring the evidence of alleged recantation within the more appropriate boundary of a Motion for a New Trial based on Rule 4-331(a).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-7\"><em>I\u2019m not sure </em>also that the defendant has met his burden of proof in showing <em>that there was due diligence given that the statements allegedly made by Jenna Jackson were made to a family member of the defendant one day after the verdict. </em>It may be that the defendant [and] his attorney didn\u2019t find out about that issue until later on, but clearly <em>if there was a recantation, </em>and I\u2019m not persuaded there was, <em>it was made not eleven days after the verdict but one day after the verdict. So there is that issue of due diligence </em>that is floating out <em>there [was] not shown to the satisfaction of the court that there was due diligence on the part of the defendant. </em>But in any event I agreed to hear the motion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b712-8\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-9\">The test, of course, is whether the evidence was, in fact, discoverable and not whether the appellant or appellant\u2019s counsel was at fault for not discovering it. As we explained in <em>Love v. State, </em>95 Md.App. at 436, 621 A.2d 910.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-10\"><em>Even a good explanation for not having exercised due diligence is not the same thing as the actual exercise of that due diligence. It is the latter that is required, not the former. </em>The modifying clause \u201cwhich could not have been discovered by due diligence ...\u201d is an <em>in rem </em>characterization of the evidence itself, not an <em>in personam </em>comment upon the lawyerly performance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b712-11\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-12\">In the \u201cinterest of judicial economy,\u201d however, Judge Long elected to overlook his qualms about diligence and to entertain the motion on the ground of newly discovered evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>Newly Discovered Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">The victim and key trial witness for the State had been the \u2022appellant\u2019s daughter, who was just short of her 12th birthday at the time of the trial. The allegation in the Motion for a New Trial was that she \u201crecanted her testimony the day after the trial to another family member.\u201d The alleged \u201crecantation\u201d was made to her eleven-year-old cousin, Shakara Jackson, and occurred while she was visiting her cousin\u2019s school. The victim allegedly told her cousin that the victim\u2019s mother and stepfather \u201chad made her say those things about her father at trial.\u201d The sum total of what the eleven-year-old abuse victim allegedly said to her eleven-year-old cousin on the day after the trial consisted of the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-6\">Q. What did Jenna tell you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-7\">A. I asked her why she say those things that she said and <em>she said because [her] mom and stepfather forced me to say them. </em>And then I told her Uncle Gene was in jail. And <em>she said my mom and stepfather said he was going to be all right that they just won the case. </em>And <em>she said she misses him so much she would go home with him.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b713-8\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-9\">An Informal Denial, Even If Made, Would Not Be a Recantation</p>\n<p id=\"b713-11\">At one point in his appellate brief, the appellant refers to what the abuse victim allegedly told her cousin as a \u201crecantation.\u201d \u201cThe fact that she did not repeat her <em>recantation </em>in open court ... should not have been dispositive.\u201d (Emphasis supplied). That choice of words, of course, is potentially treacherous hyperbole. <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>(7th ed.1999) defines the verb \u201crecant\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-12\">To withdraw or renounce prior statements or testimony formally or publicly.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b713-13\">Just as a conversation between neighbors over the back fence is not \u201ctestimony,\u201d the confidential confession, \u201cI lied,\u201d even if such a confession actually was made, is by no means a \u201crecantation.\u201d The semantic problem, of course, is that once <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>the user gets into the habit of referring to such a confidence as a \u201crecantation\u201d two or three times, he has successfully scaled a linguistic plateau and the presumptuous usage becomes a deceptively familiar commonplace. At that point, the user can nonchalantly invoke caselaw dealing with actual recantations and it will seem, to the lazy ear at least, as if those recantation cases are apposite to the case at hand. The only place to stop such semantic slippage is before it gets started. We are not in this case dealing with anything that can fairly be termed a \u201crecantation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">One might readily ask, \u201cIf a witness renounces her trial testimony, what difference does it make whether the renunciation takes place in the courtroom or on a school playground?\u201d It makes a great deal of difference. If the renunciation occurs formally in a courtroom, there is no doubt about the fact that a renunciation actually took place. It only remains to determine 1) the truth of the renunciation; and 2) its legal significance, if true. That is why we use the term of art \u201crecantation\u201d to refer to that type of in-court renunciation. If the renunciation allegedly occurred on the school playground, by contrast, the biggest uncertainty of all may well be over the historic fact of whether such a renunciation even took place.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">If we were faced with a real and undisputed recantation of her testimony by the key State witness, our evaluation of the legal significance of such a recantation would be far more problematic. In this case, however, the victim staunchly denied that she had ever made the statements attributed to her by her cousin. Under examination by appellant\u2019s counsel, the young abuse victim did not waver.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-7\">Q. All right. And during that conversation did you tell her that your mom and Patrick told you to say those things at trial?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-8\">A. <em>No, I didn\u2019t</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-9\">Q. You didn\u2019t say that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-10\">A. <em>No.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-11\">Q. Did you tell her that you were afraid of your stepfather?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>A. <em>No, I didn\u2019t.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-5\">Q. Did you tell her that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-6\">A. <em>No, I didn\u2019t.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-7\">Q. Did you tell her that you would be promised to see your dad if you testified in court the day before?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-8\">A. I don\u2019t understand the question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-9\">THE COURT: I\u2019m not sure I do either.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-10\">Q. Did you tell Shakara that your parents promised you that you would be able to see your father if you testified in court against him; did you tell her that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-11\">A. <em>No.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-12\">Q. Did you say to Shakara that all those things didn\u2019t happen?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-13\">A. <em>No, I did,n\u2019t.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-14\">Q. You didn\u2019t tell her that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-15\">A. <em>No.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-16\">Q. Did you tell Shakara that you didn\u2019t know that your dad would go to jail if you testified against him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-17\">A. <em>No, I didn\u2019t.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b715-18\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-19\">Under examination by the Assistant State\u2019s Attorney, the victim reaffirmed her trial testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-20\">Q. <em>Jenna, everything that you te,stifled to in this trial in court that day that your dad was on trial is that all true?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AtW\">A. <em>Yes.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-21\">Q. You\u2019ve not made any of it up?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-22\">A. <em>No, I haven\u2019t.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b715-23\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-24\">That, by no means, was a formal withdrawal or renouncement of her prior testimony. Far from being a recantation, it was a ringing reaffirmation. In denying the Motion for a New Trial, Judge Long so ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-25\"><em>[TJhe real issue before the court is whether there is persuasive and credible evidence of recantation on the pari </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number><em>of a crucial witness </em>in this case. And of course that witness is the victim, Jenna Jackson.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-5\"><em>Recant means according [to] Black\u2019s Law Dictionary \u201cto withdraw or repudiate formerly and publicly. \u201d </em>Mindful of that definition, <em>the normal process employed when a witness recants is, one, the execution of a sworn affidavit, or, two, sworn testimony is elicited from the recanting witness at the hearing on the motion for new trial. We clearly have neither in this case.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-6\"><em>Post trial recantations are looked upon with utmost suspicion. </em>The State\u2019s Attorney has already made note of that. One of the cases of many that says that is <em>Carr v. State, </em>39 Md.App. 478, 387 A.2d 302.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-7\">In this case <em>there is no formal or public recantation. </em>To the contrary <em>the witness alleged to have recanted has come into this courtroom and testified under oath that she did not at any time recant her testimony. </em>Therefore the motion for new trial is denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b716-8\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b716-9\">The Threshold Question of Assessing Credibility</p>\n<p id=\"b716-10\">In the context of a Motion for a New Trial based on newly discovered evidence, there is a threshold question of the trustworthiness of the newly discovered evidence and of the credibility of its source. It is clear that the judge called upon to decide the motion may assess trustworthiness and credibility for himself, even though the verdict in the case was rendered by a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-11\">In denying the Motion for a New Trial, Judge Long cited the case of <em>Carr v. State, </em>39 Md.App. 478, 387 A.2d 302 (1978). Indeed, that case is instructive as to the broad discretion vested in the trial judge in assessing new trial motions. <em>Carr </em>is particularly instructive because it was a case involving an actual recantation of testimony. In <em>Carr </em>the defendant, upon his motion for a new trial, produced an affidavit signed by one of two key State\u2019s witnesses, in which the witness stated that his trial testimony had been false and had been given \u201cunder <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>the threat of persecution [sic] and arrest by the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office.\u201d 39 Md.App. at 483, 387 A.2d 302. Notwithstanding the fact that it had been a jury trial, the trial judge assessed for himself the credibility of the recantation. \u201cIn the instant case the trial judge received and considered Oliver\u2019s affidavit but stated he did not consider it worthy of belief.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201c[T]he trial judge did not believe Oliver\u2019s recantation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 483 n. 3, 387 A.2d 302.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-4\">In affirming the trial judge\u2019s decision to deny the new trial, this Court observed, <em>Id. </em>at 484, 387 A.2d 302:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-5\">We note, as did the trial judge, that <em>post-trial recantations of witnesses are looked on with the utmost suspicion. </em>See, e.g., <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>487 F.2d 1278 (4th Cir.1973). Under these circumstances we see no abuse of discretion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A-Z\">(Emphasis supplied). We there quoted, 39 Md.App. at 483, 387 A.2d 302, <em>Jones v. State, </em>16 Md.App. 472, 477, 298 A.2d 483, <em>cert. denied, </em>268 Md. 750 (1973), as it articulated the standard for reviewing a decision by a trial judge on a motion for a new trial.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-6\">\u201cIt is, of course, well established that <em>the granting or denial of a motion for a new trial lies within the sound discretion of the trial court </em>and <em>the action of the trial court </em>upon such a motion <em>will not be disturbed </em>on appeal <em>except under the most extraordinary and compelling reasons.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"A2F\">(Emphasis supplied).

The witness took the stand at the hearing on the new trial motion and stood foursquare behind every syllable of her trial testimony. She <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>denied flatly ever having made the remarks attributed to her by Shakara Jackson. What then was the significance, in terms of threshold materiality, of the testimony of Shakara Jackson?</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">On at least three occasions this Court has stated that evidence that has value only for purposes of testimonial impeachment does not qualify as \u201cnewly discovered evidence\u201d within the contemplation of the law governing motions for a new trial. In <em>Jones v. State, </em>16 Md.App. at 477, 298 A.2d 483, we quoted with approval from <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>32 F.2d 127, 130 (8th Cir.1929), for the proposition that to qualify as newly discovered evidence, the \u201cevidence ... must not be merely cumulative or impeaching.\u201d In <em>Bright v. State, </em>68 Md.App. 41, 509 A.2d 1227 (1986), the \u201cnewly discovered evidence\u201d that was advanced on a new trial motion was the transcript from a collateral hearing that would have been useful to the defense to impeach the testimony and the report of two key State\u2019s witnesses. The trial judge denied the new trial motion, and we affirmed that denial, stating at 68 Md. App. at 56, 509 A.2d 1227:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-6\"><em>Since appellants </em>contend that they <em>would have used the </em>adjustment hearing <em>transcript for impeachment purposes, ... the evidence did not qualify as \u201cnewly discovered. </em>\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b718-8\">(Emphasis supplied). In <em>Love v. State, </em>95 Md.App. at 431, 621 A.2d 910, we reaffirmed that same principle:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-9\">No exception can be taken to the next two statements ... that <em>the evidence </em>\u201cmust be material\u201d and that it <em>\u201cmust not be merely </em>cumulative or impeaching.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b718-10\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b718-11\">That same limitation on types of newly discovered evidence that do not qualify as a basis for awarding a new trial was stated for the Court of Appeals by Chief Judge Bell in <em>Argyrou v. State, </em>349 Md. 587, 601, 709 A.2d 1194 (1998):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-12\"><em>The evidence offered </em>as newly discovered <em>must be material to the result </em>and that inquiry is a threshold question. That <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>means that <em>it must be more than \u201cmerely cumulative or impeaching. \u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b719-4\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">In <em>Campbell v. State, </em>373 Md. 637, 670, 821 A.2d 1 (2003), Judge Harrell also made it clear that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-6\">[t]o be material <em>the evidence cannot be \u201cmerely </em>cumulative or <em>impeaching.\u201d </em>The Court of Special Appeals stated in <em>Love v. State, </em>that the difference between evidence that is \u201cimpeaching\u201d and evidence that is \u201cmerely impeaching\u201d is that the latter includes \u201ccollateral impeachment and peripheral contradiction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b719-8\">Unfortunately, those statements do not end the matter. Although three opinions of this Court and two from the Court of Appeals have now told us that newly discovered evidence that is \u201cmerely impeaching\u201d will not compel or even justify the granting of a new trial, there remains the touchy problem of which impeaching evidence is \u201cmerely impeaching\u201d and which is not. As both <em>Campbell v. State </em>and <em>Love v. State </em>have suggested, the answer to that riddle may lie in the notion of \u201ccollateral impeachment and peripheral contradiction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b719-9\">In <em>Campbell v. State, </em>the newly' discovered evidence was that a key State\u2019s witness in the murder case under review had on another occasion \u201cfalsely accused another person of murder in an unrelated case.\u201d 373 Md. at 644, 821 A.2d 1. In holding that the trial judge had not abused his discretion in denying the motion for a new trial, Judge Harrell pointed out that the new evidence \u201cinvolved a collateral matter.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-10\"><em>Even if the evidence did impeach </em>Veal, <em>it would be collateral, </em>rather than material, <em>evidence </em>because it only shows that Veal lied about an unrelated matter not bearing directly on the evidence he presented at Campbell\u2019s trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b719-11\">373 Md. at 655, 821 A.2d 1 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b719-12\"> The distinction between \u201cimpeaching\u201d and \u201cmerely impeaching,\u201d albeit nuanced, is pivotally important. Newly discovered evidence that a State\u2019s witness had a number of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>convictions for crimes involving truth and veracity or had lied on a number of occasions about other matters might have a bearing on that witness\u2019s testimonial credibility, but would not have a direct bearing on the merits of the trial under review. Such evidence would constitute collateral impeachment and would, therefore, be \u201cmerely impeaching.\u201d If the newly discovered evidence was that the State\u2019s witness had been mistaken, or even deliberately false, about inconsequential details that did to go to the core question of guilt or innocence, such evidence would offer peripheral contradiction and would, therefore, be \u201cmerely impeaching.\u201d If the newly discovered evidence, on the other hand, was that the State\u2019s witness had actually testified falsely on the core merits of the case under review, that evidence, albeit coincidentally impeaching, would be directly exculpatory evidence on the merits and could not, therefore, be dismissed as \u201cmerely impeaching.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">In the case now before us, the testimony of Shakara Jackson, even accepting it <em>arguendo </em>at face value, was not that the eleven-year-old child abuse victim admitted testifying falsely, but only that she admitted testifying under strong pressure. Although that might be reason to question her credibility, it does not establish that she testified falsely. A daughter might be understandably reluctant to testify against her father, even if her testimony were true. With child custody at stake, moreover, the strong parental pressure could have been to testify truthfully, as surely as it could have been to testify falsely. The witness would have been a reluctant one in either event. The witness\u2019s alleged admission to Shakara Jackson went only to why the witness, reluctantly, testified. It did not go directly to the truth of her testimony. It bore on her testimonial credibility, but not directly on the substance of her testimony. Under the circumstances, it would seem to qualify only as collateral impeachment, to wit, as evidence that was \u201cmerely impeaching.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">In terms of characterizing Shakara Jackson\u2019s testimony, putting it in a hypothetical context may help. If the victim\u2019s conversation with Shakara Jackson had, with appropriate changes of tense, taken place the day before her trial testimo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>ny rather than the day after and had been offered in rebuttal by the defense through Shakara Jackson, what would have been its evidentiary fate? Not qualifying under any exception to the rule against hearsay, it could not have been received as substantive evidence on the merits of the appellant\u2019s guilt or innocence. It could only have been received, if at all, as a prior inconsistent statement for the limited purpose of impeaching the victim\u2019s testimonial credibility. That makes its significance peripheral, to wit, \u201cmerely impeaching.\u201d Evidence that is merely impeaching does not reach critical mass, at least in terms of permitting an appellate court to hold that a trial judge abused his discretion in denying a new trial motion resting on such a predicate.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">We will not, however, rest our holding on this borderline ground, but will go on and consider the case as if, <em>arguendo, </em>Shakara Jackson\u2019s testimony had been more that \u201cmerely impeaching.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">The Fluctuating Standard of Appellate Review For Rulings on New Trial Motions</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">In terms of the breadth of discretion entrusted to the trial judge in ruling on a motion for a new trial and the concomitant degree of deference that an appellate court will extend to such a ruling, there is a distinction, still in the process of being recognized and fully articulated, between new trial motions pursuant to Rule 4-331(a) and new trial motions pursuant to Rule 4-331(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-8\">New trial motions that must be filed within ten days, pursuant to subsection (a), almost invariably (if not invariably) are based on events that happen in the course of the trial; such as, e.g., rulings on admissibility, potential trial error that may or may not be recognized at the time of occurrence, jury instructions, jury behavior, etc. These events are of a type that will ordinarily happen under the direct eye of the trial judge. For that reason, subsection (a) expressly provides that the trial judge may order a new trial \u201cin the interest of justice\u201d for it is he who has his thumb on the pulse of the trial and is in a unique position to assess the significance of such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>events. In <em>Buck v. Cam\u2019s Broadloom Rugs, Inc., </em>328 Md. 51, 57, 612 A.2d 1294 (1992), Judge McAuliffe stressed that the range of the trial judge\u2019s discretion is accordingly at its broadest when it involves \u201cthe judge\u2019s evaluation\u201d of \u201cthe core question of whether justice has been done.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-5\">[W]e are obliged to consider <em>the breadth of discretion that is afforded a trial judge in making this type of decision. </em>As we have seen in tracing the history of our treatment of this issue, the emphasis has consistently been upon <em>granting the broadest range of discretion to trial judges ivhenever the decision has necessarily depended upon the judge\u2019s evaluation of the character of the testimony and of the trial when the judge is considering the core question of whether justice has been done.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">There is, however, a fundamental difference in kind between a new trial motion pursuant to subsection (a), dealing with what happens in the course of the trial and essentially under the eye of the trial judge, and a new trial motion pursuant to subsection (c), based on allegedly newly discovered evidence. The latter, by definition, deals with things outside the course of the trial, with evidence that was not introduced because it could not, with due diligence, have been discovered in time to be introduced. The litigation of a new trial motion pursuant to subsection (c) deals with phenomena, such as due diligence, that do not occur under the direct eye of the trial judge. In contrast to subsection (a), subsection (c) significantly does not contain the language \u201cin the interest of justice\u201d to be assessed by the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-8\">Under either subsection of Rule 4-331, the abstract standard of appellate review is the abuse of discretion standard. That seems monolithic enough, but in actuality it is not. What may shift, depending on the ground for the new trial motion being reviewed, is the degree of deference extended to the trial judge\u2019s exercise of discretion. <em>Buck v. Cam\u2019s Rugs, </em>328 Md. at 58-59, 612 A.2d 1294, expressly stated that the reins of appellate control over the trial judge\u2019s discretion may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>be tighter or looser depending upon the ground advanced for the new trial motion.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-4\">[IJt may be said that <em>the breadth of a trial judge\u2019s discretion to grant or deny a new trial is not fixed and immutable; </em>rather, it <em>will expand or contract depending upon the nature of the factors being considered, and the extent to which the exercise of that discretion depends upon the opportunity the trial judge had to feel the pulse of the trial </em>and to rely on his own impressions in determining questions of fairness and justice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">The new trial motion that was granted in <em>Buck v. Cam\u2019s Rugs, </em>for instance, involved the trial judge\u2019s assessment that an improper closing argument by a civil defendant had resulted in a damage award that was far too low to be deemed \u201cin the interest of justice.\u201d In affirming the trial judge, the Court of Appeals pointed out that on an issue of that sort, both the trial judge\u2019s discretion and appellate deference thereto are at their very broadest.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-7\">We turn to the question of whether Judge Murphy abused his discretion in granting Buck a new trial. In so doing, we are obliged to consider <em>the breadth of discretion that is afforded a trial judge in making this type of decision. </em>As we have seen in tracing the history of our treatment of this issue, <em>the emphasis has consistently been upon granting the broadest range of discretion to trial judges whenever the decision has necessarily depended upon the judge\u2019s evaluation of the character of the testimony and of the trial when the judge is considering the core question of whether justice has been done. </em>We noted, for example, that \u201c[w]e know of no case where this Court has ever disturbed the exercise of the lower court\u2019s discretion in denying a motion for a new trial because of the inadequacy or excessiveness of damages\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b723-8\">328 Md. at 57-58, 612 A.2d 1294 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-9\">Judge McAuliffe went on, 328 Md. at 59, 612 A.2d 1294.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>In the case before us, <em>the range of discretion of the trial judge was necessarily at its broadest. The motion for a new trial did not deal with </em>the admissibility or quality of <em>newly discovered evidence, </em>nor with technical matters. Instead, it asked the trial judge to draw upon his own view of the weight of the evidence; the effect of an accumulation of alleged errors or improprieties by defense counsel, no one of which may have been serious enough to provoke a request for, or justify the granting of, a mistrial; and the allegedly inadequate verdict, in determining whether justice would be served by granting a new trial.... <em>Because the exercise of discretion under these circumstances depends so heavily upon the unique opportunity the trial judge has to closely observe the entire trial, complete with nuances, inflections, and impressions never to be gained from a cold record, it is a discretion that will rarely, if ever, be disturbed on appeal. It is that concept which led this Court in the past to state, </em>albeit too broadly in the context of <em>all </em>motions for new trial, <em>that such a decision is effectively unreviewable.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">The Court of Appeals opinion then contrasted the broad discretion vested in a trial judge on the type of issue before him in <em>Buck v. Cam\u2019s Rugs </em>with the significantly narrower range of discretion to deny motions based upon newly discovered evidence. There is, of course, virtually no discretion to refuse even to exercise discretion.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-7\">On the other hand, <em>a trial judge has virtually no \u201cdiscretion\u201d to refuse to consider newly discovered evidence </em>that bears directly on the question of whether a new trial should be granted. <em>See Wash., B. &amp; A.R. Co. v. Kimmey, supra, </em>141 Md. at 250, 118 A. 648 <em>(\u201cdiscretion could not be characterized as sound which wholly disregarded evidence </em>by which its exercise should have been aided\u201d). <em>See also Browne v. Browne, </em>22 Md. 103, 112 (1864).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b724-8\">328 Md. at 58, 612 A.2d 1294 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-9\">Even if, however, the trial judge, at the threshold, considers the newly discovered evidence, the appellate court will still <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>intervene whenever it is persuaded that the trial judge did not make a proper decision based on the newly discovered evidence.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-4\"><em>[I]f newly discovered evidence clearly indicates that the jury has been misled, a new trial should be granted. </em>It would be plainly unjust to permit a verdict to stand, as against an application for a new trial seasonably made, if credible evidence, competent to be considered, and not previously discoverable by due diligence, supported the conclusion that the jury were misled as to the principal part of their award.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-5\"><em>Wash., B. &amp; A.R. Co. v. Kimmey, supra, </em>141 Md. at 250, 118 A. 648. <em>See also Angell v. Just, </em>22 Md.App. 43, 53, 321 A.2d 830 (1974) <em>(trial judge abused discretion in denying motion for new trial when newly discovered evidence was of sufficient significance to make it probable that a different result would be reached at a new </em>trial).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b725-6\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">The Court of Appeals seemed to promise us comforting uniformity, 328 Md. at 57, 612 A.2d 1294, by beginning its analysis with a quotation from <em>Mack v. State, </em>300 Md. 583, 600, 479 A.2d 1344 (1984), and the apparently reassuring cliche that the \u201cquestion whether to grant a new trial\u201d is entrusted to \u201cthe discretion of the trial court.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-8\"><em>The question whether to grant a, new tnal is within the discretion of the trial court. </em>Ordinarily, a trial court\u2019s order denying a motion for a new trial will be reviewed on appeal if it is claimed that the trial court abused its discretion. <em>Kirsner v. State, </em>296 Md. 567, 570-71, 463 A.2d 865, 867 (1983); <em>Colter v. State, </em>219 Md. 190, 192, 148 A.2d 561, 561 (1959). However, <em>an appellate court does not generally disturb the exercise of a trial court\u2019s discretion in denying a motion for a new trial</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"ArH\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b725-9\">What emerges, however, is the vexing reality that there are in the field not one, but at least two significantly distinct, \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d standards. One is, indeed, virtually <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>unreviewable. Rarely, if ever, will a trial court, under it, be found to have abused its discretion. The other, by contrast, enjoys no such special immunity from appellate scrutiny. The trial judge still has discretion, of course, but significantly less discretion than in the first category of cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">In the case now before us, Judge Long denied a motion for a new trial based on allegedly newly discovered evidence. Even under the less deferential standard applicable to the denial of a motion on such a ground, we are still persuaded that he did not overstep the less generous degree of discretion permitted him in such a case.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">The motion for a new trial in <em>Argyrou v. State, </em>349 Md. 587, 709 A.2d 1194 (1998), was also, as in this case, one based on newly discovered evidence. Chief Judge Bell reconfirmed the shifting contours of the abuse of discretion standard.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-7\">It may be said that <em>the breadth of a trial judge\u2019s discretion to grant or deny a new trial is not fixed and immutable, </em>it <em>will expand or contract depending upon the nature of the factors being considered, and the extent to which its exercise depends upon the opportunity the trial judge had to feel the pulse of the trial, </em>and to rely on his or her own impressions in determining questions of fairness and justice. Of course, the exercise of the discretion is reviewable for abuse.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b726-8\">349 Md. at 600, 709 A.2d 1194 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b726-9\">As Judge Bell also made clear, however, the burden of proof remains firmly on the defendant and the motion for a new trial still has significant \u201cprescribed requirements\u201d that must be \u25a0 satisfied for it to succeed.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-10\"><em>Maryland Rule l-SSl(c) provides for the grant of a new trial, </em>or other appropriate relief, <em>on the basis of newly discovered evidence, but only if the prescribed requirements are met. </em>To qualify as \u201cnewly discovered,\u201d <em>evidence must not have been discovered, or been discoverable by the exercise of due diligence, </em>within ten days after the jury has returned a verdict. In addition, the motion premised on newly discovered evidence must have been filed in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>circuit court, within the later of one year after the imposition of sentence or the issuance of a mandate by the appropriate appellate court. Maryland Rule 4-831(c)(2). Case law has delineated other essential requirements. <em>The evidence offered as 'newly discovered must be material to the result </em>and that inquiry is a threshold question. That means that <em>it must, be more than \u201cmerely cumulative or impeaching.\u201d </em>In addition, <em>the trial court must determine that \u201c[tjhe newly discovered evidence may well have produced a different jesult, that is, there was a substantial or significant possibility that the verdict;.of the trier of fact would have been affected. \u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">349 Md. at 600-01, 709 A.2d 1194 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">Discretion to Grant Is Discretion Not to Grant</p>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">As we turn to the merits of Judge Long\u2019s ruling, a further and self-evident observation is in order about the breadth of a trial judge\u2019s discretion. In <em>Butkiewicz v. State, </em>127 Md.App. 412, 430, 732 A.2d 994 (1999), Judge Hollander made it very clear that necessarily inherent in the discretion to grant a new trial is the concomitant discretion to deny a new trial.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-8\">We do not mean to suggest that the trial court would necessarily have erred or abused its discretion had it ruled otherwise. <em>The court had discretion to grant appellant\u2019s \u25a0motion for new trial, just as it had discretion to deny it. </em>Under the circumstances attendant here, the resolution of appellant\u2019s motion depended intrinsically upon \u201cthe judge\u2019s evaluation of the character of the testimony and of the trial,\u201d and its determination of \u201cthe core question of whether justice has been done.... \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b727-9\">In conclusion, we cannot say that the court abused its discretion in denying appellant\u2019s motion for new trial. (Emphasis supplied). See also <em>Mason v. Lynch, </em>151 Md.App. 17, 27-30, 822 A.2d 1281 (2003); <em>Aron v. Brock, </em>118 Md.App. 475, 511-12, 703 A.2d 208 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b727-10\">The Appellant\u2019s Core Contention</p>\n<p id=\"b727-11\">Although the appraisal of newly discovered evidence is an arena in which, in the words of <em>Buck v. Cam\u2019s Rugs, </em>328 Md. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>at 57, 612 A.2d 1294, \u201cthe emphasis has consistently been upon granting the broadest range of discretion to trial judges\u201d as they make an \u201cevaluation of the character of the testimony\u201d on the \u201ccore question of whether justice has been done,\u201d the appellant\u2019s theory of the case would severely cabin the judge\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">The bare bones contention is presented without supporting argument. The appellant cites <em>Yorke v. State, </em>315 Md. 578, 556 A.2d 230 (1989); <em>Campbell v. State, </em>373 Md. 637, 821 A.2d 1 (2003); and <em>Evans v. State, </em>382 Md. 248, 855 A.2d 291 (2004). Arguably, they are cited for the proposition that, once newly discovered evidence is in the case, the trial judge is largely stripped of discretion on the \u201ccore question of whether [absent that evidence at the trial] justice [was] done.\u201d One could distill from <em>Yorke, Campbell, </em>and <em>Evans </em>a largely mechanical, and far from discretionary, test that seems to assume for the newly discovered evidence maximum weight and credibility. It would deny the trial judge, who felt the pulse of the trial, the discretion to make the threshold or gatekeeping determination that the proffered evidence is either unworthy of belief or devoid of significance. We, however, get no such reading out of <em>Yorke, Campbell, </em>and <em>Evans, </em>which are silent as to the trial judge\u2019s role as a credibility gatekeeper.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">A Measuring Rod For Likely Impact</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">Quite obviously, the post-verdict discovery of new evidence should not result in vacating the original verdict and awarding a new trial unless the new evidence, offered before a new fact finder, would by some measure of likelihood produce a different verdict. The law obviously needs an articulable standard for measuring just what quality of newly discovered evidence might by some measure of likelihood produce a different verdict. The answer to such a question will inevitably remain a subject open to rampant speculation on a case by case basis, but the promulgation of a standard will at least help to reduce the level of uncertainty.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">Until 1989, however, Maryland had not found it necessary to adopt such a standard. The two generally recognized national <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>poles were the \u201cmight\u201d standard<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the \u201cprobable\u201d standard.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Yorke v. State, </em>315 Md. at 586-88, 556 A.2d 230. Because the Court of Appeals concluded in <em>Stevenson v.

The <em>Yorke-Campbell-Evans </em>line of cases does not touch the subject of the continuing obligation of the trial judge, as a part of his exercise of discretion, to make a threshold determination as to the credibility of alleg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>edly newly discovered evidence. Those three cases had no need to deal with, and did not deal with, the trial judge\u2019s role in assessing the credibility of the evidence. In <em>Yorke, </em>the DNA test evidence was what it was; it was not in dispute. In <em>Campbell, </em>the record of the witness\u2019s earlier false accusation in another case was not in dispute. In <em>Evans, </em>the FBI interviews and reports were not in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">By no means did the <em>Yorke, Campbell, </em>and <em>Evans </em>cases even suggest that an appellate court should assume significant credibility and weight for newly discovered evidence and then apply the <em>Yorke </em>test for itself. Both evaluating the credibility of the evidence, in the first place, and then weighing the significance of the evidence, in the second place, remain within the broad discretion of the trial judge. The <em>Yorke </em>Court, 315 Md. at 590, 556 A.2d 230, recognizing that the weighing process was properly in the hands of the trial judge, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-6\">The short of it is that <em>the judge found that the newly discovered evidence, weighed with the evidence before the jury </em>at the trial on the merits, <em>did not affect the verdict </em>to the extent that the outcome of the trial would be different.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A-k\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-7\"><em>Yorke v.

State, </em>373 Md. at 672, 821 A.2d 1, Judge Harrell made it clear that in the assessment of newly discovered evidence, it is the \u201csense\u201d of the trial judge, rather than an abstract measuring rod, that will be entrusted with determining the significance of the evidence.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number><em>The trial judge \u201cfelt the pulse of the trial\u201d and was entitled </em>to rely on his own impressions <em>to determine, </em>without exceeding the limits of his discretion, <em>that the new evidence bearing on Oscar Veal\u2019s trustworthiness was not substantially likely to tip the balance in favor of Campbell.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"ArqV\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b735-4\"><em>Campbell </em>recognized that newly discovered evidence does not enjoy presumptive credibility and that it is within the prerogative of the trial judge to find whether it is \u201cpersuasive.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-5\"><em>In order for the newly discovered evidence to warrant a new trial, the trial judge must find it to be </em>both material and <em>persuasive </em>such that \u201c[t]he newly discovered evidence may well have produced a different result, that is, there was a substantial or significant possibility that the verdict of the trier of fact would have been affected.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">378 Md. at 666-67, 821 A.2d 1 (emphasis supplied). The ultimate review, moreover, was clearly under the abuse of discretion standard.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-7\">Even if the new evidence as to Veal was material and Petitioner was found to have exercised due diligence, <em>the trial judge did not act in an arbitrary or capricious manner by denying the 'motion for a 'new trial.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b735-8\">373 Md. at 671, 821 A.2d 1 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b735-9\">Because so much depends on the inherent \u201csense\u201d of justice of the trial judge, the only judicial figure who had his thumb on the actual pulse of the trial, the judge\u2019s exercise of discretion in evaluating credibility is indispensable. It is not for an appellate court to decide whether it thinks a piece of newly discovered evidence might have made a difference. <em>Buck v. Cam\u2019s Rugs, </em>328 Md. at 59, 612 A.2d 1294, explained why appellate deference to the trial judge\u2019s discretion is so compellingly appropriate.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-10\">Because the exercise of discretion depends so heavily upon <em>the 'unique opportunity the trial judge Ims to closely observe the entire trial, complete with nuances, inflections, and impressions never to be gained from a cold record, it is a discretion that will rarely, if ever, be disturbed on appeal.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b736-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>It is that concept which led this Court in the past to state, albeit too broadly in the context of <em>all </em>motions for new trial, that such a decision is effectively unreviewable.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">It is the trial judge whose instinctive sense of justice is being appealed to, and it is the trial judge who is uniquely competent to assess whether the newly discovered evidence is even worthy of being credited. In <em>Jones v. State, </em>16 Md.App. at 477, 298 A.2d 483, we pointed out in this regard:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-7\"><em>It is essentially the function of the trial judge to evaluate and assess the newly discovered evidence </em>and <em>where such evidence consists of testimonial evidence </em>from a witness allegedly discovered after the trial has been concluded, <em>it is for the trial judge to determine </em>the materiality and <em>the credibility of such testimony.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b736-8\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-9\"><em>Jones v.

The trial judge denied the motion for a new trial, however, and both the Court of Special Appeals and the Court of Appeals affirmed the denial. At the outset of his opinion, Chief Judge Bell observed with respect to a trial judge\u2019s assessment of credibility:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-5\"><em>A trial court has unde latitude in considering a motion for new trial and may consider a number of factors, including credibility, </em>in deciding it; thus, <em>the court has the authority to weigh the evidence and to consider the credibility of witnesses </em>in deciding a motion for a new trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">349 Md. at 599, 709 A.2d 1194 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b737-7\">Judge Bell made it clear that the assessment of credibility is an important factor when the basis advanced for the new trial is that of newly discovered evidence.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-8\"><em>The trial courts also have authority </em>to weigh the evidence and <em>to consider credibility of witnesses when the motion is grounded on newly discovered evidence.

In short, the court focused not on the credibility of the confession in all of its details; <em>it was, </em>instead, <em>focused on the trustworthiness of the totality of the circumstances giving rise to the confession.

And of course that witness is the victim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">(Emphasis supplied). The only fact in dispute was the very happening of the schoolhouse conversation. That, therefore, was the only thing as to which Judge Long could have been seeking \u201cpersuasive and credible evidence.\u201d Self-evidently, there had been no formal and public recantation by the witness in the courtroom. That negative event spoke for itself and required no further resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-8\">Although Judge Long\u2019s discussion leading to the ruling, to be sure, wandered back and forth between a formal courtroom recantation and an informal schoolhouse \u201crecantation,\u201d the observation that the witness who had allegedly recanted \u201chas come into this courtroom and testified under oath that she did not at any time recant her testimony\u201d obviously makes reference to the informal schoolhouse \u201crecantation.\u201d The reference to the fact that the witness was \u201calleged to have recanted\u201d also obviously relates to what happened at the schoolhouse. There was no allegation that the witness recanted in the courtroom. Judge Long\u2019s overall discussion unquestionably was not confined to the fact that there was no formal recantation in the courtroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-9\">We read Judge Long\u2019s conclusion to be that Shakara Jackson\u2019s version of the disputed conversation lacked credibility, whereas the victim\u2019s version was credible. A closely intertwined and essentially indistinguishable possibility, of course, is that Shakara Jackson\u2019s testimony, even if true, was found to be not weighty enough to \u201cpersuade\u201d the judge to grant relief. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>In the alleged conversation, the victim never actually said that her testimony had been false. The bottom line was that the evidence presented by the appellant did not persuade Judge Long that a new trial should be awarded. We cannot be absolutely certain of this as his thought process but, being appropriately deferential, we find it to be highly plausible. A discretionary ruling does not require a formal opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">Whether in terms of evaluating Shakara Jackson\u2019s credibility or weighing the significance of her testimony or an undifferentiated amalgam of both, Judge Long exercised the discretion entrusted to him in ruling on a motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">A Possible Alternative Contention</p>\n<p id=\"b742-7\">There is a possibility that the appellant is raising a slightly different contention. He may be making the argument that, even if the judge\u2019s discretionary decision fell within the broad range permitted it by the <em>Yorke </em>test, the trial judge\u2019s decision would still have to be reversed, as a matter of law, if the judge said the wrong words in making his decision. In his brief, the appellant does argue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-8\"><em>The trial court applied the incorrect standard </em>in denying the motion for new trial.... Under these circumstances, <em>the trial court\u2019s failure to apply the correct standard in ruling on the motion </em>for new trial <em>requires reversal </em>of the court\u2019s ruling denying the motion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b742-9\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-10\">We are, to be sure, framing more of an argument for the appellant than he made for himself, but he may be contending that Judge Long erroneously relied exclusively on the absence of a formal courtroom recantation and failed to recognize that even an informal renunciation of critical testimony as false might theoretically satisfy the <em>Yorke </em>test for granting a new trial. The argument may be, not that Judge Long could not have rejected the evidence from Shakara Jackson as lacking sufficient credibility or sufficient weight, but only that he failed to do so, relying instead exclusively on the absence of a formal recantation.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>We hold this argument, if it is being made, to be flawed in two respects. In the first place, as we have just discussed at length, we do not believe that Judge Long\u2019s reasoning was so tightly confined. Although he defined the term \u201crecantation\u201d in formal terms and made regular references to a formal recantation, his observations and his implicit findings of fact went beyond that.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-4\">In the second place, if the language of the ruling seems unduly concerned with the subject of recantation, the reason is readily understandable. The new trial motion alleged that the child abuse victim had \u201crecanted her testimony the day after the trial.\u201d At the conclusion of the hearing, moreover, Judge Long asked for argument and appellant\u2019s counsel responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-5\">There is now testimony, depending on who you believe, that [the victim] recanted her testimony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">Other than a passing allusion to the possibility that the child witness had been \u201ccoached,\u201d something that would, at best, qualify for the \u201cmerely impeaching\u201d category, that was the only argument for a new trial even skeletally advanced. Judge Long was answering the only argument that was presented to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-8\">In response to the only thing being urged on the court by the appellant, Judge Long\u2019s ruling may well have been saying, in effect, \u201cYou are asking for a new trial on the basis of an alleged recantation. This is what the term \u2018recantation\u2019 means, and what you are offering is not a recantation.\u201d Neither the grounds raised in the Motion for a New Trial nor the argument made at the hearing on the motion ever got beyond that. The very subject of a broader rationale for granting a new trial motion was never raised by the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-9\">A Modest Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b743-10\">In terms of the deference that an appellate court should extend to a discretionary ruling by a trial judge, we find inspiring the instance of appellate discipline exercised by this Court in <em>Thodos v. Bland, </em>75 Md.App. 700, 542 A.2d 1307 (1988). The trial judge denied a Motion for a New Trial under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>circumstances in which this Court, had the decision been its to make, would have granted the motion. That predisposition on our part, however, should not have been and was not controlling. It is meaningless to pay lip service to deference when you agree with what the trial court did. The acid test of deference is when you disagree. As so well expressed by Judge Bell (now Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals), 75 Md.App. at 717, 542 A.2d 1307:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-5\"><em>Were we ruling upon appellant\u2019s new trial motion, we would have unhesitatingly granted it. </em>Nevertheless, <em>we are unable to rationalize </em>a basis for <em>finding that the trial judge abused his discretion. </em>Accordingly and <em>regretfully, we affirm </em>the judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">(Emphasis supplied). When a court can say, \u201cRegretfully, we affirm,\u201d the court is exercising robust appellate discipline.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">We are not suggesting in this case that our decision, had we been called upon to make one, would necessarily have been different from that made by Judge Long. We are simply holding that, even if that had been the ease, we would still extend to his decision the deference that is its due.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-8\">Two Questions From the Jury</p>\n<p id=\"b744-9\">In the course of the jury deliberations, Judge Long summoned counsel to the bench and informed them of an inquiry from the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-10\">Counsel, I have shown you the note we have received from the jury. They wanted [the] date father\u2019s custody petition [was] filed. The date father\u2019s custody petition was served on the mother. The date the father\u2019s custody petition was withdrawn.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b744-11\">The information the jury sought was not, however, in evidence, as Judge Long made clear to counsel.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-12\">My recollection of the evidence in this case, the testimony in this case would suggest that none of those dates came in and I\u2019m inclined to tell that we cannot give them that information [because it is] not in evidence. And they can</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>only decide the case based on the evidence that they have heard.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-4\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL:] Can we tell [them] that the petition was filed after 2000, because that\u2019s clear.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-5\">THE COURT: Ms. Hickman.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-6\">[THE PROSECUTOR:] Your Honor, I don\u2019t think there was testimony that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-7\">THE COURT: I think that information was made clear in the testimony, but they didn\u2019t specifically ask for that and Pm inclined not to inquire [into] that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b745-8\">Judge Long brought the jury back into the courtroom and gave the following response.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-9\">THE COURT: Mr. Foreman, I have a note from you [that] you want the dates that the father\u2019s custody petition was filed, the date the father\u2019s custody petition was served on the mother, and the date the father\u2019s custody petition was withdrawn.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-10\">[THE FOREMAN:] Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-11\">THE COURT: We cannot give that to you for one or two reasons or maybe both. One is because we don\u2019t have it. And even if we did, the recollection of all of us would suggest that it is not in evidence and, therefore, you remember what I said to you earlier you could only decide the case based upon the evidence and testimony that was either introduced as physical evidence or the testimony that came from the witness stand and the reasonable inferences that you could draw from that. So I can\u2019t help you. Pm sorry. You can retire and continue your deliberations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b745-12\">At the threshold, we note that the appellant did not object to Judge Long\u2019s handling of the situation. Quite aside from that, however, Judge Long was eminently correct in his response to the jury. Those dates requested by the jury were not in evidence. Without anguishing any further over this subcontention, we see no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-13\">Approximately one hour later, the jury submitted a second question. Judge Long informed counsel of the content <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>of the inquiry and of his proposed response to it. Counsel for the appellant registered a half-hearted objection.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-5\">THE COURT: Counsel, we have another note from the jury. We would like to hear the testimony of Terri Taylor again. I\u2019ve asked the court reporter. She did not record these proceedings. Even if I were to allow it to happen, she didn\u2019t record the proceedings. And we\u2019re not set up with real-time capabilities. <em>It would take a considerable amount of time for us to have it transcribed and read to them. </em>So I think what we usually do is what I\u2019m going to do in this case and that is to suggest that they have to rely on their recollection of the testimony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-6\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL:] Can I be heard just off the record?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-7\">THE COURT: Sure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-8\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL:] <em>It\u2019s my understanding it would take about an hour to transcribe that. I\u2019m only trying to make a record, </em>Judge. I mean <em>I would object, I guess, for the record </em>and ask, [since] it was only a ten minute testimony anyway that they asked for, that they be given it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b746-9\">(Emphasis supplied). Although that objection was less than Churchillian, it was enough.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-10\">Terri Taylor had been the appellant\u2019s attorney in the custody proceeding. She had been retained on January 18, 2000, and subsequently filed the custody, the visitation, and the contempt requests on his behalf. When, following the bench conference, the jury returned to the courtroom, Judge Long responded to its inquiry.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-11\">Mr. Foreman, I have a note. It says we would like to hear the testimony of Terri Taylor again.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-12\">Unfortunately, again I\u2019m not going to be much help to you. We don\u2019t have the capabilities to do that. Although my court reporter does transcribe the proceedings \u2014 I\u2019m sorry, does record the proceedings, she would have to transcribe the proceedings and we\u2019d have to read them back to you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>Real-time, if we had real-time capabilities it would almost simultaneously bring up the testimony. We have coincidentally this Tuesday met with the county commissioners to upgrade the court reporter\u2019s software package, but we don\u2019t have the capabilities to do that. So what we\u2019re going to ask you to do is to rely on your notes and your recollection of the testimony of Ms. Taylor. All I can say is, she wasn\u2019t the last witness. She was one of the last witnesses to testify.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">Although the appellant now claims that both responses constituted abuses of discretion, he clearly puts his emphasis on the second response. Maryland Rule 4-326(c) deals with a \u201cJury request to review evidence.\u201d Its language is quintessentially the language of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">The court, after notice to the parties, <em>may </em>make available to the jury testimony or other evidence requested by it. (Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">The appellant cites <em>Veney v. State, </em>251 Md. 159, 246 A.2d 608 (1968), for the proposition that Judge Long had \u201cthe discretion to have the court reporter read back [the] requested trial testimony to the jury.\u201d Of course, he did. If the posture of the case were reversed and if it were the State somehow appealing his decision to do so, we would affirm such an exercise of discretion. Inherent within the discretion to do something, however, is the self-evident discretion not to do something. That is what the very concept of discretion means. As the <em>Veney </em>opinion itself phrased the largely unfettered range of judicial discretion, 251 Md. at 173, 246 A.2d 608:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-8\"><em>The trial judge within his discretion may permit </em>the reading to the jury of the official court stenographer\u2019s notes of the testimony at the trial, or <em>may refuse permission so to do.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b747-9\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-10\">Appellate courts are highly deferential to a trial judge\u2019s discretionary determinations. Even in cases in which the appellate court might have deemed it wiser or fairer to have ruled otherwise, it will not presume to substitute its judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>for that of the trial court except in the rare case in which the trial judge has literally abused his discretion. To rule differently than the appellate court might have ruled is not, <em>ipso facto, </em>such abuse. In <em>Hart v. Miller, </em>65 Md.App. 620, 501 A.2d 872 (1985), another case cited by the appellant, Judge Getty well observed for this Court, 65 Md.App. at 626-27, 501 A.2d 872:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-5\">Discretion signifies choice. Consideration of the problem does not preordain a single permissible conclusion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">See also <em>Leach v. State, </em>47 Md.App. 611, 625, 425 A.2d 234 (1981) (\u201c[I]t is in the sole discretion of the trial judge to have portions of the transcript read to the jury when requested under Maryland Rule [4-326(c) ].\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-7\">Much of the caselaw cited by the appellant deals with situations in which a trial judge fails utterly to exercise discretion at all, a situation quite distinct from actually exercising discretion but doing so in a way adverse to the wishes and the interests of the protesting party. In this case, Judge Long, for better or for worse, clearly exercised his discretion as he explained to counsel that granting the request would consume too much time.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-8\">It would take a considerable amount of time for us to have it transcribed and read to them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b748-9\">Even in objecting, appellant\u2019s counsel estimated that \u201cit would take about an hour to transcribe that.\u201d At that point, it was shortly after 7 P.M. Our point, for the moment, is that we are dealing with an actual exercise of discretion, and not with a non-exercise. In exercising his discretion, Judge Long also noted in his response to the jury that, in this single day trial, Terri Taylor had been \u201cone of the last witnesses to testify\u201d before the jury began its deliberations at 4:46 P.M. The trial transcript reveals that at least six witnesses had testified before Terri Taylor took the stand and that only a single witness followed her to the stand. Judge Long\u2019s point was that the jury\u2019s recollection of Terri Taylor\u2019s testimony should still have been fresh.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number><em>Yuen v. State, </em>43 Md.App. 109, 403 A.2d 819 (1979), was a case in which, after acknowledging that the trial judge had the discretion to permit counsel in closing argument to read from portions of the trial transcript, this Court held that it was not an abuse of discretion for him to have refused to permit such a reading.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-4\">The deference that an appellate court will extend to a discretionary decision by a trial judge was eloquently expressed by Chief Judge Wilner for this Court in <em>North v. North, </em>102 Md.App. 1, 14, 648 A.2d 1025 (1994):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-5\">There is a certain commonality in all of these definitions, to the extent that they express the notion that <em>a ruling reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard will not be reversed simply because the appellate court would not have made the same ruling. </em>The decision under consideration has to be <em>well removed from any center mark imagined, </em>by the reviewing court and <em>beyond the fringe of what that court deems minimally acceptable.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">Judge (now Chief Judge) Bell wrote to the same effect for the Court of Appeals in <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship No. 3598, </em>347 Md. 295, 312, 701 A.2d 110 (1997):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-8\"><em>Questions 'within the discretion of the trial court are \u201cmuch better decided by the trial fudges than by appellate courts, </em>and the decisions of such judges should only be disturbed where it is apparent that some serious error or abuse of discretion or autocratic action has occurred.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aek\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-9\">We hold that in his responses to the two jury inquiries in this case, Judge Long was not guilty of an abuse of judicial discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-10\">Considerations at Sentencing</p>\n<p id=\"Aja\">The appellant\u2019s trial concluded on March 11, 2004. Judge Long pronounced sentence on the appellant on June 10. In complete compliance with Maryland Rule 4-341, Judge Long had ordered a Presentence Report. Copies of that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>report were timely sent to both the appellant and the State. At the outset of the sentencing hearing, Judge Long asked counsel if they had \u201cany additions or corrections to the presentence investigation.\u201d Counsel for the appellant responded, \u201cI have two.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">One of the areas routinely investigated in the course of preparing a Presentence Report is that of employment. Although the appellant himself had made no mention of it to the investigator, it was learned that from early 2000 until the spring of 2002, the appellant had been employed as an associate minister with the Liberty Rock Church in Crisfield. The investigator checked with the minister of that church and learned the following, as he summarized it in his Presentence Investigation report.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-6\">Although not mentioned by Mr. Jackson, it was learned that Mr. Jackson was also involved as an associate minister with Liberty Rock Church in Crisfield from early 2000 to spring 2002. On 4/28/04 Mr. Dave Dunn, who was the pastor of the church for thirteen years prior to his recent resignation, met with the undersigned to provide information about Mr. Jackson. Mr. Dunn advised that he and his congregation were duped and scammed by Mr. Jackson who used his position of trust as a method of influence and power for his financial gain. Mr. Dunn noted that Mr. Jackson talks eloquently and gives off an aura of genuineness causing people to follow his lead. Mr. Dunn noted he and other church members have lost thousands of dollars based on their blind trust of Mr. Jackson. Mr. Dunn acknowledged strong feelings of betrayal by Mr. Jackson which caused Mr. Dunn to doubt his ability to pastor resulting in his resignation. In summary, Mr. Dunn stated that Mr. Jackson never sees himself as wrong and opts to trade performance for integrity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b750-7\">The appellant took understandable umbrage at that section of the Presentence Report. Although he used the word \u201cobject,\u201d what he actually did was to argue that Judge Long should discredit the former employer\u2019s characterization of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>appellant because it was uncorroborated and that he should give it little, if any, weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">Well, Judge, I would object, I guess, to the statement that David Dunn himself made to the Presentence Investigator about the fact that he was duped and scammed by Mr. Jackson. I don\u2019t think that there is any evidence to suggest that. <em>Perhaps he had a bad relationship with him </em>or whatever, but certainly <em>there is nothing </em>in the Presentence Investigation <em>that indicates he was duped or scammed </em>other than he talks about some things that <em>there just seems . to be nothing to corroborate what this man is saying. </em>I don\u2019t know what his letter says, but I would ask that the Court negate that.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">That is the sum total of objection made by the appellant to the sentencing proceeding. The appellant did not offer any counter evidence. The appellant did not ask for additional time to produce any counter evidence. We see no error with respect to Judge Long\u2019s consideration of the Presentence Report.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-8\">The second prong of the contention is a tempest in a teapot. It seems to be the local custom in Somerset County for various parties interested in the sentencing to write to the judge directly or to submit letters through counsel, offering their appraisal, good or bad, of the defendant about to be sentenced. When such letters are addressed directly to the court, Judge Long indicated that it was his regular practice to send copies of such letters both to the State and to the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-9\">Reverend David Dunn, the minister of the Liberty Rock Church and the appellant\u2019s former employer, in addition to talking to the presentence investigator, sent a letter to Judge Long directly. This was revealed to the appellant at the outset of the sentencing proceeding.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-10\">THE COURT: I also received three letters and I want to know\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>JACKSON v.

I think that one just came in </em>so it may be <em>why </em>\u2014 we <em>try to send these out when we get them.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-13\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I understand, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AX2A\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-14\">We note several things of significance. In terms of timeliness for all such letters to be received, appellant\u2019s counsel indicated that he had three additional letters to submit at the sentencing hearing itself. The record also contains 24 letters written on the appellant\u2019s behalf, many of them having been mailed to Judge Long directly.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-15\">On appeal, albeit not at the sentencing hearing itself, the appellant now takes the State to task for not having \u201cprovide[d] to the defense in advance of sentencing any information that the State expect[ed] to present to the court for consideration in sentencing, and that was not done.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b752-16\">The State did not submit the letter. It was sent directly to Judge Long. The letter was dated June 8. The sentencing hearing was on June 10. Judge Long indicated that \u201cthat one just came in.\u201d At the sentencing hearing itself, moreover, the appellant lodged no objection to the receipt of the letter by the court. The appellant asked for no further time in order to respond to the contents of the letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>In terms of timeliness of notice and of opportunity to respond, we note that although Rev. Dunn\u2019s letter to Judge Long was somewhat more detailed than was the summary of his statement to the Presentence Report investigator, the thrust of the criticism of the appellant was precisely the same. It added nothing really new. Whatever steps the appellant could have taken to reply or respond to the contents of the Presentence Investigation would have been precisely the steps called for by the letter to Judge Long. The appellant took no such steps, even when he was on timely notice with respect to the Presentence Investigation Report.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">Quite aside from the fact that nothing has been preserved for appellate review, we see no error in the sentencing proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">JUDGMENTS AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b729-10\">.

Wallace, </em>528 F.2d 863, 866 n. 3 (4th Cir.1976): \"There is more than a faint possibility of a different jury verdict but something less than a probability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b730-12\">The \"probable\u201d standard, however, remains even more esoteric. It is generally referred to with no greater definement than was set out years ago in <em>Berry v. State, </em>10 Ga. 511, 527 (1851), which spoke in terms of the evidence being \"so material that it would probably produce a different verdict if a new trial were granted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b730-13\">315 Md. at 586 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b730-14\">. Realistically, that may well remain the test both here and abroad, however much we pretend to the contrary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b731-10\">. As this Court observed in <em>Love v. State, </em>95 Md.App. 420, 431, 621 A.2d 910 (1993):</p>\n<p id=\"b731-11\">In <em>Yorke v. State, </em>315 Md. 578, 556 A.2d 230 (1989), however, the Court of Appeals opted to adopt an intermediate standard that fell somewhere between the <em>Berry </em>test and the <em>Larrison </em>test.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
