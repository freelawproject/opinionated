After a bench trial and pursuant to a not guilty plea based upon an agreed statement of facts, appellant was convicted of both counts and sentenced to thirty days\u2019 incarceration for possession of marijuana, to which the conviction for possession of paraphernalia merged. Appellant presents one question on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">Did the circuit court err in denying his motion to dismiss?</p>\n<p id=\"b354-9\">For the reasons that follow, we affirm the judgment of the circuit court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b354-10\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b354-11\">On February 8, 2004, while appellant was in the \u201cwork release pod\u201d of the Caroline County Detention Center, jail officials observed \u201csuspicious behavior\u201d that led them to search appellant. The officers found a plastic bag containing 2.8 grams of marijuana on appellant\u2019s person.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-12\">Prior to trial, appellant filed a motion to dismiss the charge of possession of marijuana, asserting that marijuana is listed as a Schedule I Controlled Dangerous Substance, which, in turn, is defined, in part, as a substance that has \u201cno accepted medical use.\u201d Maryland Code (2002) \u00a7 5-402(g)(2) of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>Criminal Law Article (\u201cCL\u201d). He argued that, by enacting the \u201cMedical Marijuana\u201d law, \u201cthe legislature declared that marijuana has ... valid medical functions and characteristics which can be recognized in the reduced penalty phase.\u201d He also contended that because the General Assembly did not reschedule marijuana, it \u201clack[s] any proper legislative scheduling.\u201d The circuit court stated: \u201c[I am] just gonna go ahead and deny your motion, dismiss outright. Because I mean I have looked at this before, if it [engenders an] appealable issue, that\u2019s fine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">On appeal, appellant repeats the position he took in the motion to dismiss. He asserts that, \u201c[w]hile reasonable minds may differ\u201d as to whether marijuana \u201cever truly met\u201d the requirements of Schedule I classification, \u201cthat was certainly the position of the General Assembly prior to October 1, 2008, the effective date of the Darrell Putman Compassionate Use Act\u201d (\u201cthe Compassionate Use Act\u201d). He argues that the Compassionate Use Act \u201cdemonstrates recognition by the General Assembly that marijuana has at least some accepted medical use,\u201d and that \u201cthe failure to reschedule marijuana renders its current classification arbitrary and unreasonable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">The State counters that \u201cthe plain language of the statute makes it clear that the legislature did not intend to invalidate the crime of possession of marijuana,\u201d but, rather, \u201cclearly contemplated the continued illegality of possession of marijuana.\u201d Additionally, the State asserts that the legislative history does not demonstrate that the General Assembly \u201cintended to effectively reclassify marijuana as something other than a Schedule I substance,\u201d and that the classification of marijuana as a Schedule I substance is not arbitrary or unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">The State points out that marijuana\u2019s status as a Schedule I drug \u201cis evidence that the legislature believes that the substance meets the requirements of [CL] \u00a7 5-402(g)(l-3).\u201d <em>See Poore v. State, </em>39 Md.App. 44, 73, 384 A.2d 103 (1978) (heroin, as a Schedule I drug, is \u201cdeemed to have no legitimate or accepted medical use in the United States\u201d); <em>Gonzales v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number><em>Raich, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 125 S.Ct. 2195, 2204, 162 L.Ed.2d 1 (2005) (\u201cSchedule I drugs are categorized as such because of their high potential for abuse, lack of any accepted medical use, and absence of any accepted safety for use in medically supervised treatment.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">CL \u00a7 5-402(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-7\">(a) Schedule I consists of each controlled dangerous substance:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-8\">(1) listed in this section;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-9\">(2) added to Schedule I by the Department [of Health and Mental Hygiene] under \u00a7 5-202(b) of this title; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-10\">(3) designated as a Schedule I controlled dangerous substance by the federal government unless the Department objects under \u00a7 5-202(f) of this title.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-11\">Marijuana is listed as a Schedule I drug in CL \u00a7 5-402(d)(l)(vii).

Glass, </em>386 Md. 401, 409, 872 A.2d 729 (2005) (citations omitted). \u201cAll other canons, including the one directing that the words used in the statute be read literally, are subject to that governing imperative.\u201d <em>Barr v. State, </em>101 Md.App. 681, 687, 647 A.2d 1293 (1994) (citations omitted). \u201c[W]e read the words \u2018in light of the full context in which they appear, and in light of external manifestations of intent or general purpose available through other evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Williams v. State, </em>329 Md. 1, 15, 616 A.2d 1275 (1992). In effectuating that rule, courts must read all parts of a statute together, with a view toward harmonizing the various parts and avoiding both inconsistencies and senseless results that could not reasonably have been intended by the General Assembly. <em>Barr, </em>101 Md.App. at 687, 647 A.2d 1293. \u201c \u2018[I]t is presumed that the General Assembly acted with full knowledge of prior legislation and intended statutes that affect the same subject matter to blend into a consistent and harmonious body of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Pete v. State, </em>384 Md. 47, 65, 862 A.2d 419 (2004) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">The plain language of CL \u00a7 5 \u2014 402(d)(1)(vii) classifies marijuana as a Schedule I substance. When the General Assembly enacted the Compassionate Use Act and amended the penalty provisions for possession of marijuana, it did not reclassify the substance. Moreover, pursuant to CL \u00a7 5-402(a)(3), a substance listed as a Schedule I controlled substance by the federal government is, by reference, classified as a Schedule I substance under Maryland law. Marijuana is listed as a Schedule I drug by the federal government under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812(e)(10) (2002).'</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">The enactment of the Compassionate Use Act does not persuade us that the General Assembly now believes that the Schedule I classification of marijuana is inappropriate. Contrary to appellant\u2019s assertion, the General Assembly did not put \u201cits imprimatur on the medical use of marijuana.\u201d Rather, CL Supp. \u00a7 5-601(c)(3)(i) does nothing more than provide that \u201cthe defendant may introduce and the court shall consider\u201d evidence of medical necessity as a mitigating factor, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>the language of CL Supp. \u00a7 5-601(c)(3)(ii) clearly contemplates a conviction of use or possession of marijuana. Possession or use of marijuana, <em>even in the event of a \u201cmedical necessity,\u201d </em>remains illegal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">We see no irreconcilable conflict between the General Assembly\u2019s permitting a sentencing court to consider \u201cmedical necessity\u201d evidence in mitigation of a sentence to a particular <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>individual and continuing to classify marijuana as a Schedule I substance. Although it is an administrative law case, <em>Alliance for Cannabis Therapeutics v. Drug Enforcement Administration, </em>930 F.2d 936 (C.A.D.C.1991), helps to illustrate the distinction between an \u201caccepted medical use\u201d for scheduling of controlled substances purposes and recognition by some physicians of a medical use for a particular substance. There, petitioners, the Alliance for Cannabis Therapeutics and the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, sought reclassification of marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule II of the Controlled Substance Act. The petitioners argued before an Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) that marijuana had medical uses for treatment of cancer, glaucoma, and other diseases, and should be classified as a Schedule II substance. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>The ALJ found that a \u201c \u2018respectable minority\u2019 of American physicians accept those uses,\u201d and ruled that marijuana had a \u201ccurrently accepted medical use.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 938. The Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration (\u201cthe Administrator\u201d) rejected the ALJ\u2019s recommendation, determining that the phrase \u201ccurrently accepted medical use\u201d required more than a showing that a \u201crespectable minority\u201d of physicians accepted the usefulness of the drug. <em>Id. </em>Instead, in declining to reclassify marijuana, the Administrator relied on the lack of \u201c \u2018verifiable scientific data and acceptance by the medical community,\u2019 \u201d his conclusions that \u201c \u2018the chemistry, toxicology, and pharmacology of marijuana has not been established,\u2019 \u201d and that \u201cits effectiveness [has not been] documented in humans with scientifically-designed clinical trials.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">Petitioners argued on appeal that the Administrator unreasonably rejected the evidence that \u201ca number of physicians believe marijuana is medically useful and, instead, improperly predicated his determination on the absence of demonstrated scientific evidence that the drug is medically useful and safe.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 939. The Court concluded that the Administrator\u2019s determination was not unreasonable:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-6\">The difficulty we find in petitioners\u2019 argument is that neither the statute nor its legislative history precisely defines the term \u201ccurrently accepted medical use\u201d; therefore, we are obliged to defer to the Administrator\u2019s interpretation of that phrase if reasonable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b360-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 939.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">Other courts have concluded that the lack of accepted medical use of marijuana does not mean that it has no possible medical use. In <em>Jenks v. State, </em>582 So.2d 676, 679 (Fla.Ct. App.1991) (citing Fla. St. \u00a7 893.03 (1989)), the Florida intermediate appellate court determined that, while a portion of the Florida statute recited that a substance in Schedule I, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>which marijuana was included, \u201chas a high potential for abuse and has no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States,\u201d the legislature also recognized that \u201ccertain substances are currently accepted for certain limited medical uses in treatment in the United States but have a high potential for abuse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">In <em>Isbell v. State, </em>428 So.2d 215, 216 (Ala.Crim.App.1983) (citing Ala.Code \u00a7 20-2-23(3)(j) (1975)), the Court of Criminal Appeals of Alabama concluded that the enactment of the Therapeutic Research Act (\u201cTRA\u201d) did not conflict with the finding that marijuana had a \u201c \u2018high potential for abuse\u2019 \u201d and had \u201c \u2018no accepted medical use in treatment in the United States.\u2019 \u201d The Court reasoned that the legislature noted the possibility that marijuana could alleviate side effects of chemotherapy and the effects of glaucoma, but concluded that more research was needed. \u201cWhile marijuana <em>may </em>be useful in the treatment of some medical conditions it has not achieved <em>accepted </em>medical use or safety in its prescription and application.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 217.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">In <em>State v. Palmer, </em>96 Wash.2d 573, 637 P.2d 239 (1981), the Supreme Court of Washington rejected Palmer\u2019s contention that the State Board of Pharmacy had abused its discretion in not reclassifying marijuana as a Schedule II drug. The Court noted that while the executive secretary of the Board had recognized that \u201csome doctors have recommended [use of marijuana] to their patients,\u201d he had defined an \u201cacceptable medical use\u201d as meaning that the \u201csubstance is accepted among practicing physicians generally and also accepted by the United States Food and Drug Administration.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 240.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">The enactment of the Compassionate Use Act by the General Assembly does not reflect a change in its views on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>classification of marijuana. In the context of the overall statutory scheme, to maintain its classification as a Schedule I substance is neither irrational nor arbitrary. The Act does not create a statutory defense, and its focus on punishment suggests that no common law defense is available. The Act merely permits the introduction of, and requires the court to consider in mitigation of sentence upon conviction, evidence of \u201cmedical necessity\u201d for using or possessing marijuana. Although in the case of a medical necessity the penalty may be less severe, use and possession of marijuana clearly remains a crime. Any further \u201csocial balancing\u201d is for the General Assembly, and not the courts.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b354-13\">. The State asserts, as a preliminary matter, that the conviction for possession of paraphernalia is not properly before us. Given our affirmation of appellant\u2019s conviction of possession of marijuana, we need not consider the merits of the foregoing assertion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b358-6\">. It is not necessary to determine the meaning of \"medical necessity\u201d to resolve this case. Other courts, however, have considered \"medical necessity\u201d when it has been raised <em>as a defense </em>in possession of marijuana cases, and have analogized it to the common law defense of necessity, which requires that harm be imminent and that there is no legal alternatives to its use. <em>See, e.g. Emry v. United States, </em>829 A.2d 970, 973 (D.C.App.2003) (Even if a medical necessity defense to possession of marijuana existed, it would not apply to a defendant who had not exhausted legal alternatives and for whom injury was not imminent.), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>540 U.S. 1094, 124 S.Ct. 970, 157 L.Ed.2d 803 (2003); <em>Jenks v. State, </em>582 So.2d 676, 678-79 (Fla.Ct.App.1991) (\"medical-necessity\u201d defense was \"a more particular application\u201d of the common law necessity defense), <em>review denied, </em>589 So.2d 292 (Fla.1991); <em>State v. Hastings, </em>118 Idaho 854, 801 P.2d 563, 564 (1990) (Defendant should have been allowed to present a common law necessity defense to felony possession of marijuana.).</p>\n<p id=\"AoY\">Some courts have concluded that the language of the Controlled Substances Act, characterizing Schedule I substances as having no accepted medical use, is contrary to a defense of medical necessity. In <em>United States v. Oakland Cannabis Buyers' Cooperative, </em>532 U.S. 483, 121 S.Ct. 1711, 149 L.Ed.2d 722 (2001), the United States Supreme Court refused to read a common law medical necessity exception for marijuana into the federal Controlled Substances Act. The Court noted that for Schedule I substances such as marijuana, \"there is but one express \u2022 exception, and it is available only for Government-approved research projects.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 490, 121 S.Ct. 1711. The Court also noted that it had never held that necessity was \"a viable justification for violating a federal statute\u201d and opined that such a defense would \"entail a social balancing that is better left to Congress.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 491 n. 4, 121 S.Ct. 1711.</p>\n<p id=\"AFr\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Tate, </em>102 N.J. 64, 505 A.2d 941, 944-45 (1986), the New Jersey Supreme Court held that the necessity defense was not available to a defendant charged with possession of marijuana because its classification as a Schedule I substance indicated that the legislature had determined that marijuana has \"high potential for abuse\u201d and \"no accepted medial use in treatment * * * or lacks accepted safety for use in treatment under medical supervision.\u201d The Court concluded that the legislature had considered a medical necessity defense and determined that medically necessary use should be permitted only under the Controlled Dangerous Substances Therapeutic Research Act.</p>\n<p id=\"AOQ\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>In <em>State </em>v. <em>Hanson, </em>468 N.W.2d 77, 78-79 (Minn.App.1991), the Minnesota Court of Appeals held that the necessity defense was not available to a charge of possession of marijuana because the existence of the THC Therapeutic Research Act (\"the Act\u201d) indicated that the legislature had considered the possible medical uses of marijuana were only those recognized in the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"AbL\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Poling, </em>207 W.Va. 299, 531 S.E.2d 678, 685 (2000) (citing W. Va.Code \u00a7 60A-2-203(1997)), the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia concluded that the defense of medical necessity was unavailable for Schedule I Controlled Substances because the legislature had determined that they had \"no accepted medical use in treatment in the United States or lack[ ] accepted safety for use in treatment under medical supervision.\u201d It held that medical necessity was unavailable as an affirmative defense Lo a marijuana charge \"because the Legislature has designated marijuana as a Schedule I controlled substance with no exception for medical use.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"ALc\">In Maryland, the defense of necessity arises \"[i]f a choice exists but only between two evils, one of which is the commission of a prohibited act, and the emergency was not created by the wrongful act of any other person.\u201d <em>Sigma Reproductive Health Center v.

State, </em>8 Md.App. 439, 448, 260 A.2d 656 (1970), this Court determined that the defense of necessity is not applicable to charges of control of heroin and possession of narcotic paraphernalia. We explained: \"[I]t has been held that in a prosecution for an offense not requiring intent, as are the offenses here, the defense of necessity is not available, at least where the defendant could have avoided the emergency by taking advance precautions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing 21 Am.Jur.2d, \u00a7 99, p. 179 (citing <em>Commonwealth v.
