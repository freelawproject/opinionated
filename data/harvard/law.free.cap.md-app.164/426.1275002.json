They appeal from a judgment in the Circuit Court for Washington County, rendered in favor of the County Commissioners and Paul N. Crampton, Jr. (collectively, \u201cappellees\u201d). That judgment affirmed the County Commissioners\u2019 decision to re-zone certain property to the PUD zoning classification.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">Appellants present four questions for our review, which we have re-ordered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-6\">I. In a piecemeal rezoning hearing, may facts presented by unsworn witnesses be considered in determining whether the applicant\u2019s case is supported by substantial evidence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-7\">II. Is remand inappropriate in the absence of substantial evidence of adequacy of the adjacent roadway and of general compatibility?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-8\">III. In Washington County, may a planned unit development floating zone be established in the absence of an affirmative finding by the rezoning authority that the proposed site is located adjacent to an adequate roadway, as required by the applicable zoning ordinance?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-9\">IV. In Washington County, should the reasonably probable of fruition requirement or a concurrency standard be applied in the floating zone compatibility analysis?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b452-10\">For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>PACTS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">On November 7, 2002, Mr. Crampton filed an \u201cOrdinance Amendment Application\u201d (\u201cthe application\u201d) with the Planning Commission. Mr. Crampton proposed to reclassify a 97.27 acre parcel of land (\u201cthe property\u201d) from its \u201cA\u201d Agricultural zoning designation to the \u201cA\u201d Agricultural Planned Unit Development (\u201cPUD\u201d) zone.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The property, also referred to as \u201cEmerald Pointe PUD,\u201d is bounded on the west by Marsh Pike and on the east by a large parcel of private property that is used for agricultural purposes. To the north is Longmeadow Road and on the property\u2019s southern border is Maryland Route 60.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">During the Concept Plan Review step of the PUD rezoning process, <em>see </em>\u00a7 16.5(a)(1), several local administrative agencies submitted reports and recommendations to the Planning Commission concerning the application. None of these agencies had objections to the application at that stage of the review and approval process.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Planning Commission also received letters from neighboring property owners in support of and opposed to the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">On January 13, 2003, a joint public hearing on the application was held before the Planning Commission and the County Commissioners. <em>See </em>\u00a7 16.5(a)(2). At the outset of the hearing, at which no oaths were administered, a staff member of the Planning Commission discussed the \u201cStaff Report and Analysis\u201d (the \u201cReport\u201d) that was conducted in response to the application. The Report included enrollment figures for the public schools serving the property, and a statement that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>Maryland State Highway Administration (\u201cMSHA\u201d) had requested that access to the property be limited to Marsh Pike.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">Attached to the Report was a \u201cPreliminary Consultation\u201d (\u201cthe Consultation\u201d), prepared by the Planning Commission. The Consultation reflected that Mr. Crampton and several officials, including members of the Washington County Engineering Department (the \u201cEngineering Department\u201d) and the Washington County Planning Department, had met to discuss, among other things, the traffic conditions along Marsh Pike. The Consultation noted that the Engineering Department had decided that Mr. Crampton and the Washington County officials would have to reach an agreement on \u201cthe liability and maintenance of [a] proposed median\u201d at any entrance to the property on Marsh Pike. The Engineering Department also stated that the \u201cTraffic Impact Study\u201d wodld have to be revised.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">The Planning Commission staff member stated at the joint hearing that Mr. Crampton proposed that the property be developed to include 89 semi-detached or duplex lots, 88 single family lots, 92 townhouse lots, a residential retirement center, a community center, and 9,000 square feet of commercial development. The staff member also stated that the Engineering Department and MSHA had requested updated traffic impact studies.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">Mr. Crampton appeared at the joint hearing. He discussed the application and the development proposal in detail, noting in his statement that 35 to 40 units would be added to the development each year, and that the entire project would take 10 to 15 years to complete.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">An engineer with Fox &amp; Associates also appeared in support of the application. He discussed the application and stated that a company called \u201cStreet Traffic Group\u201d had prepared a traffic study for the property. He reported that the traffic study indicates \u201cthat the existing system could be supported by the surrounding area network and the critical intersections will continue to operate at acceptable levels of service with the full development of the PUD provided that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>some improvements are made.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Engineering Department and MSHA had a copy of the study and were reviewing it, and had several preliminary comments regarding traffic along Marsh Pike, including that Marsh Pike needed \u201cwidening\u201d and other improvements at intersections along Marsh Pike. The engineer did not know whether the Engineering Department and MSHA had made formal comments on the traffic study as of the date of the hearing. The engineer also stated that the property would \u201chave a minimal impact on [public] schools.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">More than 25 members of the public, several of whom are appellants, spoke in opposition to the application. The protestants generally asserted that the existing public schools did not have the capacity to handle the influx of children the development of the PUD would produce, the PUD was not compatible with neighboring properties, and the development would adversely affect traffic along Marsh Pike.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">The chairperson of the Planning Commission stated that the \u201cfile\u201d would remain open for 10 days to allow additional comments to be submitted to the County Commissioners before they decided whether to approve the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">On March 3, 2003, the Planning Commission voted three-to-one to recommend that the County Commissioners deny the application. In a letter dated the following day, the Planning Commission informed the County Commissioners of its recommendation. The Planning Commission stated that it \u201cbased this recommendation on\u201d the traffic study submitted at the January 23, 2003 hearing, and on \u201cconcerns that the residential development density proposed for the [property] was not consistent with the residential density in adjacent developments.\u201d The Planning Commission also stated its \u201copinion that the road infrastructure in the immediate vicinity of the [property] was deficient.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b456-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>On March 13, 2003, the County Commissioners held a regular meeting to consider and vote on the application. The County Commissioners voted unanimously to accept \u201cthe findings of fact as set forth in the report from the County Attorney.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The County Commissioners also voted three-to-one to approve the rezoning of the property to PUD. Pertinent to this appeal, the County Commissioners made the following findings of fact:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-4\">\n<em>Education Facilities</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-5\">The proposed residential uses within the PUD are single-family, semi-detached units, and townhouses. The single-family and semi-detached units would be exempt from the Article V School section of the Adequate Public Facilities Ordinance because this property is situated within the Urban Growth Area. Townhouses, however, would not be exempt. The subject property is located within the school districts of Paramount Elementary, Northern Middle, and North Hagerstown High School.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-6\">* * =!=</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-7\">\n<em>Present and future transportation patterns in the area.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-8\">The subject property ... has approximately 3,080 feet of frontage along Marsh Pike. The Washington County Highway Plan classifies this section of Marsh Pike as a Major Collector, which requires a minimum distance of 300 feet between all new access points and 40 feet of future dedicated right of way from centerline. This classification\u2019s major function is to provide for intra-county travel.... The property has approximately 1,082 feet of frontage along Leitersburg Pike, an Intermediate Arterial.... One access point onto Leitersburg Pike from Emerald Pointe has been proposed, however, the [MSHA] has requested that all access points to the development be limited to Marsh Pike.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>The ... Engineering Department and the [MSHA] made numerous comments regarding the subject property\u2019s impact on surrounding roadways and internal street design ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-4\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-5\">The Planning Commission opined that the road infrastructure in the immediate vicinity of the subject property was deficient based upon a traffic study submitted by [Mr. Crampton] and that the residential development density proposed for the subject property was not consistent with the residential density in adjacent developments.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-6\">For the reasons set forth elsewhere in these findings of fact, [the County Commissioners] respectfully declinef] to adopt this opinion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-7\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-8\"><em>Effect of the PUD on community </em>infrastructure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-9\">\n<em>The adoption of the Adequate Public Facilities Ordinance (APFO) in 1990 has taken on a supportive role that was previously th,e sole responsibility of this item in the zoning ordinance during the rezoning stage when considering the deliberation of PUD cases. Due to this change, it would appear that now the Planning Commission and the [County Commissio'nersJ would only have to address infrastructure issues at the zoning stage that would appear to be highly unsolvable.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-10\">A major concern of neighborhood residents who testified at the public hearing and who sent in correspondence during the comment period dealt with the PUD\u2019s effect on the area road network as a result of increased traffic. Terrence McGee, Chief Engineer, County Engineering Department, did not take exception to the rezoning and responded to this application by stating, \u201call issues under our jurisdiction associated with this request can be adequately addressed through the site plan approval process.\u201d One of the major comments is that the existing Traffic Impact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>Study will need to be revised to reflect the new plan. To date, the [ ] Engineering Department has no final comments with regard to the updated traffic study....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-4\">Another item that generated a significant amount of testimony at the public hearing was the issue of the PUD\u2019s impact on the neighborhood schools of Northern Middle, North Hagerstown High and, in particular, Paramount Elementary. ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-5\">[Data pertaining to school capacity and projected student population is omitted.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-6\">.... Discarding the units proposed for the retirement center, there would be 267 units subjected to APFO testing under the new policies. This would equate to 54 students or a total of 108 students projected from this development or in the pipeline. Since the PUD is pi*ojected for a build out over ten years, it is reasonable to assume that not all 54 students would come on line in the same year. With an available capacity of 81 students, it would seem that projected student population from this PUD as well as approved developments would not generate an inadequate condition in the near future....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-7\">The PUD article of the zoning ordinance was adopted prior to the adoption of the APFO. Within the context of the PUD article ..., references are made regarding impact on infrastructure (sections 16.0 and 16.7(a)). Neither of these references says that public school capacity must be adequate in order for a PUD zoning to be approved. However, the impact on the public schools must be given consideration when determining the appropriateness of the PUD and the proposed density. The APFO, on the other hand, allows the [County Commissioners] and the Planning Commission to take control of school adequacy issues associated with new development....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-8\">.... During the Development Plan review stages, [Mr. Crampton] should be investigating the adequacy of the schools and prepare a course of action if an adequacy problem is anticipated. The Planning Commission shall determine if the schools are adequate during the Final <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>Development Plan review stage. As specified under [] section 16.6(d)2ii, agreements for responsibility between County and developer for providing on-site and off-site improvements[ ] shall be developed as part of the Final Development Plan. This would include addressing the developer\u2019s responsibility for school adequacy if he intends to continue with the project. If any of the schools are determined to be inadequate, and the developer does not wish to make them so, the final plat or site plan cannot be approved. If approval of the plat does not occur within six months, the PUD zoning designation would be lost and the property would revert back to its original, underlying classification.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AxJ\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">Appellants filed a petition for judicial review of the County Commissioners\u2019 decision, in the Circuit Court for Washington County. Appellees participated in the petition. After a hearing, the court issued an opinion and order affirming the County Commissioners\u2019 decision.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">Appellants noted this timely appeal.

We begin with a discussion of the County Commissioners\u2019 authority to re-zone property to the PUD classification, and the process through which an application for re-zoning must pass.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">The authority of the County Commissioners to reclassify the zoning of property in Washington County is derived from Maryland Code (1957, 2008 Repl.Vol.), Article 66B (\u201cArticle 66B\u201d). <em>See Bd. of County Comm\u2019rs of Washington County v. H. Manny Holtz, Inc., </em>60 Md.App. 133, 135 n. 1, 481 A.2d 513 (1984) (noting that Article 66B authorizes Washington County to create a Board of Zoning Appeals with limited authority, and recognizing that \u201c[applications for reclassification [of land] must be made directly to the Board of County Commissioners, which alone is authorized to approve them\u201d). Article 66B, \u00a7 10.01(a) specifically authorizes the County Commissioners \u201cto enact[] ordinances or laws providing for or requiring,\u201d <em>inter alia, </em>PUDs and floating zones.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">Section 27.1 of the zoning ordinance authorizes an individual to petition the County Commissioners for a re-zoning of property. The provisions specifically governing the rezoning of land in Washington County to a PUD or floating zone are located in Article 16 of the zoning ordinance. Section 16.0, entitled \u201cPurpose,\u201d provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-8\">The intent of these PUD regulations is to permit a greater degree of flexibility and more creativity in the design and development of residential areas than is possible under conventional zoning standards. The purpose is also to promote a more economical and efficient use of the land while providing for a harmonious variety of housing choices, a more varied level of community amenities, and the promotion of adequate open space and scenic attractiveness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-9\">The PUD is a floating zone that may be established in any of the Districts specified in Section 16.4. The change or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>mistake rule does not apply to the PUD process, but the Planning Commission and the Board of County Commissioners, in the deliberation of a PUD application, shall establish findings of fact that consider, at a minimum, the purpose of the PUD District, the applicable policies of the adopted Comprehensive Plan for the County, the compatibility of the proposed PUD with neighboring properties, and the effect of the PUD on community infrastructure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">Section 16.5 outlines a \u201cmulti-step\u201d review and approval process for a PUD re-zoning application. Subsection (a) of that section provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-5\">Design and Development Schedule: It is the intent of this Ordinance that the PUD not be a speculative device. The Concept Plan as submitted by the applicant shall reflect the actual development to be designed and constructed within a reasonable time frame. Each phase of the design and development review process must occur within specified periods. If the applicant fails to submit his plans, or if construction does not commence, as specified by this Ordinance, the zoning of the site shall automatically revert to its previous classification.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-6\">If the applicant abandons the plans for the PUD at any time prior to the start of construction before the automatic reversion date and desires to proceed with development permitted under the previous zoning, he may do so by submitting notification to the Planning Commission. Such notification shall constitute official withdrawal of the applicant\u2019s plans for the PUD and shall permit reversion of the previous zoning classification without the necessity of the rezoning process.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-7\">1. Concept Plan Review: The purpose of the Concept Plan Review is to provide an exchange of information between the developer and the Planning Commission. The intent is that the developer provide the [Planning] Commission with general information for the layout, density, specific uses and the like. The [Planning] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>Commission, in turn, will provide the developer with corresponding response.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-4\">2. Zoning Approval: Following the Concept Plan Review, a joint public hearing with the Board of County Commissioners and the Planning Commission will be scheduled. Within 120 days after the public hearing, the Board of County Commissioners, after receiving a recommendation from the Planning Commission, shall render a decision on the PUD application. Zoning approval constitutes tentative approval of density and design features as shown on the Concept Plan. Minor changes in concept design may subsequently be approved by the Planning Commission without an additional public hearing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">(Footnote omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">The remaining three steps of the review and approval process require approval of the Planning Commission. <em>See </em>\u00a7 16.5(a)3. through 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">Two other provisions of the zoning ordinance concern traffic. Section 16.4(b), which is one of the provisions we are asked to interpret in this appeal, provides that, as a general requirement, a PUD \u201cshall be located ... adjacent to adequate roadway facilities capable of serving existing traffic and the future traffic generated by the uses in the PUD.\u201d Section 16.7(i), titled \u201cTraffic Circulation and Parking,\u201d provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-8\">1. Existing and planned streets and highways shall be of sufficient capacity to serve existing traffic and all new traffic when fully developed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-9\">2. The capacity of existing streets and highways serving a PUD shall be considered by the [Planning] Commission in determining density. Density resulting in traffic capacity being exceeded on streets and highways shall not be permitted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b463-10\">In 1990, Washington County approved an APFO pursuant to the authority granted it by Article 66B, \u00a7 10.01. <em>See </em>APFO Article XII.

Appellees further assert that, should we reach the merits of the argument, there is no requirement in statute, the County Code, or case law that \u201ctestimony\u201d at a public hearing like the one in this case be given under oath.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-9\">Appellees are correct that appellants, many of whom spoke at the joint public hearing without having taken an oath, did not object or otherwise raise the issue at the hearing.

Indeed, the only ground upon which appellants rely in their argument that the County Commissioners lacked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>substantial evidence to support their findings is that \u201c[r]emoving unsworn commentary and argument of counsel from the body of evidence before the [County Commissioners] leaves the decision of the [County Commissioners] unsupported.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">The County Commissioners had before them numerous documents. Included among those documents were Mr. Crampton\u2019s application; the minutes of the Planning Commission\u2019s meeting during which the Planning Commission voted against approving the application; numerous letters from individuals opposed to the re-zoning application; zoning maps; a plat of the property; the Report of the Planning Commission\u2019s staff; a deed to the property; and recommendation reports of several agencies including the Engineering Department, Health Department, MSHA, and the Washington County Water &amp; Sewer Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">Appellants make no argument that those documents do not constitute substantial evidence upon which the County Commissioners could render their decision. Appellants argue only that the documentary evidence came from Mr. Crampton, the Planning Commission, and appellants, yet the County Commissioners did not require any of them to face cross-examination before submitting those documents. Appellants maintain that all of this documentary evidence should have been placed before the County Commissioners by sworn witnesses who faced cross-examination, and, therefore, it should not have been considered by them.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">We disagree. \u201cA zoning board, along with other administrative agencies, is generally not bound by the technical rules of evidence although it must observe fundamental fairness in dealing with the parties who appear before it.\u201d <em>Ginn v.

The documents properly could be considered by the County Commissioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>We have reviewed the documents and conclude that they make fairly debatable the appropriateness of rezoning the property to the PUD zone. In other words, the County Commissioners\u2019 decision, even without the unsworn witness statements, was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\">Because we hold that there was substantial evidence in the record to support the County Commissioners\u2019 decision, we need not discuss appellants\u2019 contention that we should reverse that decision without remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">\n<em>Issue 3: Interpretation of \u00a7 16.4</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">Appellants assert that \u00a7 16.4(b) requires the County Commissioners to make a specific factual finding concerning whether the site for a proposed PUD is \u201ccapable of serving existing traffic and the future traffic generated by the uses in the PUD.\u201d Appellants argue that nothing in the zoning ordinance authorizes the County Commissioners to defer a finding of roadway adequacy. Appellants insist that the finding must be made at the time the County Commissioners decide whether to re-zone a property to PUD, <em>i.e., </em>after the joint public hearing that occurs at the second step of the PUD review and approval process.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">Appellees respond that \u00a7 16.4(b) should not be read in isolation. They contend that re-zoning land to the PUD zone is a multi-step process under \u00a7 16.5, and that the County Commissioners properly determined that \u00a7 16.4(b) should be read in conjunction with the rest of the zoning ordinance and the APFO.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">Whether the County Commissioners properly construed the zoning ordinance is a question of law. <em>See Capital Commercial, </em>158 Md.App. at 96, 854 A.2d 283 (noting that \u201c \u2018[a] challenge as to a regulatory interpretation is, of course, a legal issue\u2019 \u201d) (citation omitted).

Contrary to appellant\u2019s argument, the statute does not state, or even imply, that the County Commissioners must assure themselves, at the time of re-zoning, that roadways adjacent to the property are able at that time to accommodate future traffic generated by the uses of the PUD.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">A statute that \u201c \u2018is part of a statutory scheme\u2019 \u201d must not be read in isolation; instead, the statute must be read together with the rest of the statutory scheme to ascertain the true intention of the Legislature. <em>Mayor &amp; Council of Rockville v.

Section 16.4 is entitled, \u201cGeneral Requirements,\u201d and reads in its entirety:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-7\">(a) Ownership: The tract of land to be approved for development as a PUD must be in single ownership with proof of that ownership submitted to the Planning Commission by no later than review and approval of the Final Development Plan. Application for a PUD may be filed either by the owner or by a person having a substantial contractual interest in the land.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>(b) Location: PUDs shall be located within the Urban Growth Area or the Town Growth Areas in the A, RR, RS, RU, RM and HI-2 Districts.

A public hearing is not required unless a major change is made by the developer to the Concept Plan; minor changes may be approved by the Planning Commission. Where there is a question about the degree of change being major or minor, the Planning Commission shall make that determination. All other provisions of Sections 16.5(a)3, 4 and 5 shall apply.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">(Footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">Nothing in \u00a7 16.4 places an affirmative duty on the County Commissioners to make specific findings concerning the adequacy of adjacent roads or water and sewer facilities during the re-zoning stage of the PUD review and approval process. Subsection (c), for example, simply declares that all PUD zones must be served by public water and public sewer facilities. Consistent with the title of the section, the requirements that a PUD be located next to adequate roadway facilities and be serviced by public water and sewer facilities are merely \u201cgeneral requirements.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">We have also examined \u00a7 16.7, entitled, \u201cDesign Standards.\u201d That section provides a series of standards that \u201care intended to ensure that the PUD is compatible with neighboring properties and ... provides a quality living environment for its residents.\u201d Subsection (i) of that section is titled, \u201cTraffic Circulation and Parking,\u201d and provides, in pertinent part, that \u201c[ejxisting and planned streets and highways shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>be of sufficient capacity to serve existing traffic and all new traffic <em>when fully developed.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). Section 16.7, read together with \u00a7 16.4(b), confirms the County Commissioners\u2019 conclusion that the latter provision does <em>not </em>require their determination, at the re-zoning stage, that adjacent roads are currently capable of handling both existing traffic and the predicted future needs of the PUD.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\">This construction of \u00a7 16.4(b) also makes sense in light of \u00a7 1.2 of the APFO. Section 1.2 of the APFO provides that the purpose of the ordinance is to ensure \u201cthat public facilities and services needed to support new development shall be available <em>concurrently with </em>the impacts of such new developments.\u201d (Emphasis added).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> It follows from the use of the word \u201cconcurrently,\u201d that public facilities, including roads, need not be available <em>in advance </em>of \u201cthe impacts of such new developments.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">The County Commissioners recognized that appellants were understandably concerned with increased traffic resulting from the PUD. The County Commissioners also recognized, correctly, that such concerns can be and must be addressed by the Planning Commission at later stages of the PUD review and approval process. APFO \u00a7 3.4 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-6\">New development not meeting the requirements for adequate public facilities contained within this Ordinance shall not be approved by the Planning Commission unless the developer reaches an agreement with the Board of County Commissioners for the purpose of ensuring the adequacy of public facilities!)]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-7\">And, APFO \u00a7 4.4 provides, in pertinent part:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-8\">Except as otherwise provided in this Ordinance, if an existing road is determined by the Planning Commission to be inadequate to accommodate the traffic flow projected to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>be generated from the new development when combined with existing traffic flow, the new development shall not be approved.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">These provisions ensure that the Planning Commission does not approve new development if it will cause an existing road to be inadequate to handle traffic generated by that development, unless the developer first reaches an agreement with the County Commissioners to ensure the adequacy of the roadway facilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">Appellants argue that, under <em>Annapolis Mkt. Place, LLC v. Parker, </em>369 Md. 689, 802 A.2d 1029 (2002), \u201cthe benchmark of adequacy [is] defined such that, in order to be adequate, the facilities must be in existence or programmed for construction.\u201d From that premise, appellants argue that, in this case, adequacy of facilities must be resolved at the time of rezoning, and not deferred.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">In <em>Parker, </em>the Court of Appeals interpreted specific provisions of the Anne Arundel County Code (\u201cAACC\u201d), provisions that are significantly different from the provisions of the zoning ordinance and APFO at issue in this case. The AACC mandated that \u201c \u2018a rezoning may not be granted except on the basis of an affirmative finding that ... transportation facilities ... are either in existence or programmed for construction.\u2019 \u201d 369 Md. at 693, 802 A.2d 1029. Annapolis Market Place, LLC (\u201cAMP\u201d), the property owner, filed an application with Anne Arundel County to rezone its property from residential classifications to a commercial classification. <em>Id. </em>at 697, 802 A.2d 1029. An Administrative Hearing Officer denied the application. <em>Id. </em>at 698, 802 A.2d 1029. AMP appealed the hearing officer\u2019s decision to the Anne Arundel County Board of Appeals (\u201cBoard of Appeals\u201d). <em>Id. </em>The Board of Appeals granted the application, reasoning, <em>inter alia, </em>that public facilities were adequate to accommodate the uses permitted by the commercial zoning classification. <em>Id. </em>at 699, 802 A.2d 1029. With regard to transportation concerns, the Board of Appeals determined \u201cthat the accomplishment of [] proposed traffic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>improvements is reasonably probable of fruition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 700, 802 A.2d 1029.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\">Neighboring property owners sought judicial review in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County. The circuit court reversed the Board of Appeals\u2019 decision. One of the grounds upon which the circuit court ruled was \u201cthat a developer\u2019s \u2018promises to make [traffic] improvements\u2019 did not satisfy the requirement of being either \u2018in existence or programmed for construction.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id,, </em>at 701-702, 802 A.2d 1029. AMP appealed the circuit court\u2019s decision to this Court. We affirmed, in an unreported opinion, and held, <em>inter alia, </em>that \u201c \u2018the Board [of Appeals] erred, as a matter of law, in disregarding the plain language of the statute that requires that adequate facilities be \u201cin existence or programmed for construction,\u2019 \u201d the latter of which [we] found did not include a developer\u2019s promise.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 702, 802 A.2d 1029.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">The Court of Appeals affirmed. The Court interpreted AACC, Art. 3, \u00a7 2-105(a)(3), <em>id. </em>at 705, 802 A.2d 1029, focusing on the meaning of the phrase \u201cprogrammed for construction,\u201d id<em>. </em>at 709, 802 A.2d 1029. As for the Board of Appeals\u2019 \u201cconsideration of the adequacy of roads,\u201d the Court held that the Board of Appeals should not have relied on <em>Grea,te,r Colesville, supra, </em>to determine that improvements to transportation facilities were reasonably probable of fruition in the foreseeable future. <em>Id. </em>at 717, 802 A.2d 1029. The Court declared that the Board of Appeals erred in noting \u201cthat \u2018improvements to transportation facilities w[ould] be required prior to approval of any subdivision of th[e] Property,\u2019 \u201d because the Board of Appeals should have determined, as required by the AACC, \u201cthat adequate access roads ... were either in existence or programmed for construction.\u201d <em>Id, </em>at 718, 802 A.2d 1029. The Court held that, \u201cfb]y its own terms, ... \u00a7 2-105(a)(3) excludes from consideration at zoning as an acceptable level of commitment facilities that are characterized merely as \u2018reasonably probable of fruition\u2019 and/or those the provision of which at the time of subdivision may be proffered by the developer.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b476-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number><em>Parker </em>is inapposite for the simple, yet dispositive reason that the AACC provisions at issue in <em>Parker </em>are different in material respect from \u00a7 16.4(b). The applicable Code provisions addressed in <em>Parker </em>mandated that the Anne Arundel County Board of Appeals determine that roadway improvements are \u201ceither in existence or programmed for construction,\u201d and therefore the \u201creasonably probable of fruition in the foreseeable future\u201d test should not have applied. Section 16.4(b) does not mandate that, at the time of PUD re-zoning consideration, the County Commissioners must determine that improvements to adjacent roadways be \u201ceither in existence or programmed for construction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">We hold that the zoning ordinance and APFO, read together, do not require that the County Commissioners find, before approving the re-zoning of land to a PUD, that an adjacent roadway is currently adequate to handle both existing and future traffic. Instead, the statutory scheme as a whole mandates that the Planning Commission monitor adequacy of roadway facilities throughout the PUD review and approval process, and throughout the period of development.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">\n<em>Issue 4: Applicability of the \u201creasonably probable of fruition in the foreseeable future\u201d test</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">Appellants argue that the County Commissioners erred because they did not \u201crequire that infrastructure necessary to support the development contemplated in the proposed [PUD] be existing or reasonably probable of fruition in the foreseeable future.\u201d Referring to school facilities in particular, they argue that the County Commissioners should have employed \u201cthe reasonably probable of fruition in the foreseeable future\u201d test, applied in, <em>e.g., Montgomery County v. Greater Colesville Citizens\u2019 Ass\u2019n, </em>70 Md.App. 374, 521 A.2d 770 (1987), before determining whether such facilities are adequate to support development of the PUD.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>Appellees respond that the PUD review and approval process outlined in \u00a7 16.5 \u201cis much more time sensitive and definite than the \u2018reasonably probable of fruition in the foreseeable future\u2019 test,\u201d and that, together, the zoning ordinance and APFO take the place of that test.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\"><em>Greater Colesville, supra, </em>guides our analysis of these arguments. We therefore discuss the case in some detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">In <em>Greater Colesville, </em>we reviewed a decision of the County Council for Montgomery County, sitting as the District Council (\u201cthe Council\u201d), to re-zone land to a floating zone. 70 Md.App. at 376, 380-81, 521 A.2d 770. Of primary concern in the decision to re-zone was the capacity of an intersection near the property to handle traffic generated by the development. <em>Id. </em>at 377, 521 A.2d 770. A hearing examiner concluded that the applicant\u2019s proposed improvements to the intersection \u201cwould render the intersection adequate\u201d to support traffic generated by the project, and that those \u201cimprovements were reasonably probable of accomplishment within the foreseeable future!.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 379, 521 A.2d 770.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">The Council agreed with the hearing examiner and approved the re-zoning. <em>Id. </em>at 380, 521 A.2d 770. The circuit court reversed the Council\u2019s decision. <em>Id. </em>at 380, 521 A.2d 770. We reversed the circuit court. <em>Id. </em>at 391, 521 A.2d 770.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">The issue we decided was whether the Council\u2019s findings on the traffic issue were \u201cfairly debatable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 384, 521 A.2d 770. We recognized that resolution of that issue was determined by \u201cwhether the improvements proposed to be made in the traffic system are reasonably probable of fruition in the foreseeable future.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 384, 521 A.2d 770.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-9\">We reviewed the zoning scheme in Montgomery County. That scheme required an applicant to submit a development plan to a planning board. The planning board, a hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>examiner, and the Council were required to review the plan. Then, if re-zoning is granted, no construction could occur until the planning board, after a public hearing, approved a site plan. <em>Id. </em>at 386-87, 521 A.2d 770.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">We said that \u201c[t]he \u2018reasonably probable of fruition in the foreseeable future\u2019 test is functionally a mechanism for gauging the likelihood of premature development and, thereby, to avoid it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 387, 521 A.2d 770. That test, therefore, \u201cnecessarily involves assessing the probability that actions required to be done in the future will, in fact, occur.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">We concluded in <em>Greater Colesville </em>that the zoning ordinance at issue, like the \u201creasonable probable of fruition in the foreseeable future\u201d test, is \u201ca mechanism for controlling premature development.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 389, 521 A.2d 770. We took into account the requirement in the zoning ordinance \u201cof development in compliance with an approved development plan and its post zoning controls,\u201d which permits the development to be phased in conformance \u201cwith the accomplishment of required improvements or services.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Indeed, the zoning ordinance at issue in <em>Greater Colesville </em>is \u201cmore flexible, as well as more effective than the \u2018reasonably probable of fruition\u2019 test.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Therefore, \u201c[w]hen that test is applied in the context of this ordinance not only is the timing of required improvements controlled, but because no development may be undertaken unless and until the required improvements have been made, the order of their completion vis-vis commencement of the approved development is controlled as well.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As a result, \u201cunder this zoning scheme, improvements that are reasonably probable of fruition in the foreseeable future become reasonably certain of fruition.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">We turn now to ascertain whether the Washington County zoning scheme, provided by the zoning ordinance and APFO, like the Montgomery County scheme, is more flexible, as well as more effective, than the \u201creasonably probable of fruition in the foreseeable future\u201d test.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">In order to obtain PUD rezoning approval in Washington County, a developer is required to submit a \u201cConcept Plan\u201d to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>the County Commissioners and the Planning Commission. <em>See </em>\u00a7 16.5(a). The concept plan must \u201creflect the actual development to be designed and constructed within a reasonable time frame.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If the developer does not submit the concept plan or does not commence construction in accordance with the timing provisions of the zoning ordinance, the zoning classification of the PUD will automatically revert to the original zoning classification. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">During the review process, the Planning Commission and the developer exchange information concerning, <em>inter alia, </em>the density and layout of the PUD development. <em>See </em>\u00a7 16.5(a)l. At this stage, the Planning Commission must consider, and \u201cmake findings of fact concerning, at a minimum, the impact of the proposed development on adjacent properties, the availability of public facilities, the impact of the proposed development on public roadways, the impact on public schools, fire and police protection, and the availability of adequate open space.\u201d \u00a7 16.7(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">Next, a joint public hearing is held before the County Commissioners and the Planning Commission. The Planning Commission must submit to the County Commissioners its recommendation concerning whether to re-zone the property. If the County Commissioners approve the re-zoning to PUD, such \u201c[zjoning approval constitutes tentative approval of density and design features as shown on the Concept Plan.\u201d \u00a7 16.5(a)2.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">Even after zoning approval is obtained, the developer is required to submit a \u201cPreliminary Development Plan\u201d to the Planning Commission within six months of the zoning approval, with an extension of time allowed only for a good cause finding by the Planning Commission. At this stage, the Planning Commission may either approve or disapprove the Preliminary Development Plan. <em>See </em>\u00a7 16.5(a)3.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">If the Planning Commission approves the Preliminary Development Plan, the developer must then submit a \u201cFinal Development Plan\u201d for approval. If the Planning Commission approves the Final Development Plan, <em>see </em>\u00a7 16.5(a)4., the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>developer must then \u201csubmit a Site Plan ... for the entire PUD or for any phase for [Planning] Commission review ____\u201d \u00a7 16.5(a)5. The Planning Commission must approve or disapprove the Site Plan. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">Each of these steps requires the Planning Commission to make decisions that involve administration of the APFO. <em>See </em>APFO \u00a7 3.1 (providing, in part, that the APFO \u201cshall be administered by the Planning Commission\u201d). The APFO provides that the Planning Commission may not approve any new development that does not meet the requirements of the APFO, \u201cunless the developer reaches an agreement with the [County Commissioners] for the purpose of advancing the adequacy of public facilities[.]\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 3.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">Section 1.2 of the APFO is titled \u201cPurpose,\u201d and provides that the APFO\u2019s purpose is to ensure</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-8\">that public facilities and services needed to support new development shall be available concurrently with the impacts of such new developments. In meeting this purpose, public facility and service availability shall be deemed sufficient if the public facilities and services for new development are phased, or the new development is phased, so that the public facilities and those related services which are deemed necessary by the local government to operate the facilities necessitated by that new development, are available concurrently with the impacts of the new development.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-9\">The zoning ordinance and APFO, in conjunction, require that development of a PUD comply with an approved site plan, together with post re-zoning approvals administered by the Planning Commission. The zoning ordinance and APFO permit such development to be phased commensurate with establishment of adequate public facilities, for the purpose of controlling premature development.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>We conclude that the PUD rezoning scheme in Washington County, like the scheme at issue in <em>Greater Colesville, </em>is more flexible and more effective than the reasonably probable of fruition in the foreseeable future test. Indeed, in Washington County, development of a PUD, or any phase of a PUD, may not begin until the Planning Commission is satisfied that the required improvements to public facilities are made. We conclude, as we did in <em>Greater Colesville, </em>that under the zoning scheme we consider, \u201cimprovements that are reasonably probable of fruition in the foreseeable future become reasonably certain of fruition.\u201d <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">Given the zoning scheme, the County Commissioners did not err when they decided that they did not \u201chave to address infrastructure issues\u201d at the re-zoning approval stage of the PUD review and approval process, unless those infrastructure issues \u201cappear to be highly unsolvable.\u201d The County Commissioners correctly recognized that development controls are in place in the zoning ordinance and APFO that permit the County Commissioners to make findings regarding adequacy of public facilities at the zoning approval stage, but leave to the Planning Commission the duty of handling the details related to the adequacy of those facilities, in accordance with the zoning ordinance and APFO.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b451-12\">.

In <em>Heard v. Foxshire Assocs., </em>145 Md.App. 695, 806 A.2d 348 (2002), we discussed, in <em>dicta, </em>the general nature of proceedings before administrative agencies. We said that, because judicial review of the decision of an administrative agency at both the circuit court and appellate levels is based on the record made before the agency, it is essential that the record of the administrative proceedings be orderly and accurate. <em>Id. </em>at 710, 806 A.2d 348. Therefore, \u201cit is important that the presiding officer [of the administrative agency proceedings] be certain that witnesses are properly sworn and identified and that the record does not contain unsworn comments by unidentified persons.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 709-10, 806 A.2d 348. In addition, \"[i]t is equally important that [all] documents and other exhibits be carefully identified and cataloged in the record.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 710, 806 A.2d 348.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-13\">Although appellants have waived their right to complain that the witnesses at the joint public hearing were not placed under oath, we reaffirm the importance of having witnesses sworn at such proceedings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b473-9\">. A \u201cnew development\u201d under the APFO \u201cconsists of new subdivisions and site plans for new construction received for approval by the [Planning Commission] after [December 1, 1990]----\u201d \u00a7 2.3.13. Appellants present no argument that Mr. Crampton's development plans would not constitute a \"new development.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b476-7\">. Appellants also assert, without citation to authority and without developing the argument, that the County Commissioners \"impermissibly delegated an essential zoning function to\" the Planning Commission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>when they left to the Planning Commission the determination of the PUD's \"compatibility\u201d with the surrounding neighborhood. We shall not make the argument for them, and decline to address the issue. <em>See Honeycutt v. Honeycutt, </em>150 Md.App. 604, 618, 822 A.2d 551, <em>cert. denied, </em>376 Md. 544, 831 A.2d 4 (2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b480-10\">.

In a footnote, appellants bring to our attention the County Commissioners\u2019 findings concerning adequacy of public school facilities to handle any increased enrollment brought about by the uses in the PUD. At the time the County Commissioners made their decision, the APFO provided that student enrollment at public schools not exceed 105% of the state-rated student enrollment capacity of the school. Also at that time, the County Commissioners used data from a June, 2002 enrollment report concerning the number of students enrolled at the public schools that would be effected by development of the PUD. Since that time, the APFO has been amended. It now provides, with regard to public elementary schools in Washington County, that enrollment may not exceed 85% of the state-rated student enrollment capacity. <em>See </em>APFO \u00a7 5.4.1(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">Relying on the proposition that we apply the law in effect at the time we make our decision, appellants ask us to hold that the increased number of students that is projected to be caused by development of the PUD would violate the 85% provision of APFO \u00a7 5.4.1(a). This we cannot do. The effect of the change in capacity contemplated by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>APFO is a matter for the administrative agency to decide in the first instance. The Planning Commission, therefore, should consider the revised APFO when it considers whether to approve subsequent plans during the PUD plan and approval process.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
