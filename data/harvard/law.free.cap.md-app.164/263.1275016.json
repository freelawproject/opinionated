When that decision was affirmed by the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County, Hodgson noted this appeal, requesting that we resolve this jurisdictional issue in his favor. We cannot for the reasons set forth below.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">The facts are not in dispute. Appellee, Flippo- Construction Company, Inc., hired Hodgson, a carpenter by trade, in Maryland, where it is headquartered and where Hodgson resides. For the first three years of his employment, from November 1995 through 1998, appellant worked almost exclusively at job sites in Maryland. That changed in 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">From 1999 until the date of his accident, three years later, in 2001, appellant was principally assigned to District of Columbia job sites. While employed chiefly in the District of Columbia, appellant continued to perform work in Maryland and Virginia. Appellant also traveled to Maryland two to three times a week, when requested to do so by his employer, to purchase supplies from Maryland vendors, after which he either delivered them to his D.C. job site the same day or kept them in his truck overnight at his Maryland apartment and delivered them the next morning. Appellant testified that he also periodically drove to Flippo\u2019s headquarters in Forestville, Maryland, \u201cto deliver checks and pick up some payrolls or whatever they sent [him] for.\u201d And he attended meetings and classes at Flippo\u2019s Maryland headquarters approximately three times a year.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">On December 7, 2001, appellant was injured while working at a company job site in the District of Columbia. He filed a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>claim for his injuries with both the Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission and the District of Columbia Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Seeking dismissal of the Maryland claim, Flippo argued that the Maryland Commission did not have jurisdiction over appellant\u2019s claim because his injury occurred in the District of Columbia where he had been working for most of the year preceding his injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">Flippo\u2019s employment records indicated that, during the year before his injury, appellant spent approximately 1,195.5 hours or 60.29% of his total \u201cfixed job site\u201d time at D.C. job sites; 411.5 hours or approximately 20.75% of his total \u201cfixed job site\u201d time at Maryland job sites; and 215 hours, approximately 10.84% of his total \u201cfixed job site\u201d time at Virginia job sites. An additional 161 hours or 8.12% of his working time was attributed to \u201cmiscellaneous\u201d jobs he performed in Maryland. Those jobs, appellant testified, included \u201cremodeling] the office for the company\u201d and \u201cputting machine[s] together for construction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">After a hearing, the Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission concluded that it did not have jurisdiction over appellant\u2019s claim and dismissed it. The Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County agreed and affirmed that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">Appellant contends that the circuit court erred in concluding that he was not a \u201ccovered employee,\u201d under Md.Code (1991, 1999 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 9-203(a) of the Labor and Employment Article (\u201cL.E.\u201d), and, as a consequence, that the Commission did not have subject matter jurisdiction over his workers\u2019 compensation claim. That, of course, presents us with a question of statutory interpretation, requiring that we determine the scope of that section of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. L.E. \u00a7\u00a7 9-101 to 9-1201.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>Before undertaking that task, we note that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act is remedial in nature and we are therefore required to \u201cliberally construe[ ]\u201d its provisions \u201cin favor of injured employees\u201d so as \u201cto effectuate its benevolent purposes.\u201d <em>Subsequent Injury Fund v. Slater, </em>27 Md.App. 295, 300, 340 A.2d 405 (1975). Yet, we may not, in interpreting it, overstep its legislatively-drawn boundaries and grant coverage beyond that which is authorized by the plain language of its provisions. <em>Barnes v. Children\u2019s Hospital, </em>109 Md.App. 543, 554, 675 A.2d 558 (1996). And that, as we shall see, is precisely what appellant entreats us to do and why we must reject his entreaty.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">Labor and Employment \u00a7 9-203 which, in conjunction with L.E. \u00a7 9-202, largely defines the Act\u2019s coverage, plainly indicates, by its title and substance, that, in Maryland, the \u201csite of ... employment\u201d is the touchstone for determining whether an employee is covered by the Act. <em>McElroy Truck Lines, Inc. v. Pohopek, </em>375 Md. 574, 581, 826 A.2d 474 (2003). That section states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-6\">L.E. \u00a7 9-203. Site of Employment</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-7\">(a) Except as otherwise expressly provided, an individual is a covered employee while working for the employer of the individual:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-8\">(1) in this State;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-9\">(2) outside of this State on a casual, incidental, or occasional basis if the employer regularly employs the individual within this State; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-10\">(3) wholly outside the United States under a contract of employment made in this State for the work to be done wholly outside of the United States.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-11\">(b) (1) An individual is not a covered employee while working in this State for an employer only intermittently or temporarily if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-12\">(i) the individual and employer make a contract of hire in another state;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-13\">(ii) neither the individual nor the employer is a resident of this State;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>(iii) the employer has provided workers\u2019 compensation insurance coverage under a workers\u2019 compensation or similar law of another state to cover the individual while working in this State;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-5\">(iv) the other state recognizes the extraterritorial provisions of this title; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-6\">(v) the other state similarly exempts covered employees and their employers from its law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-7\">(2) If an individual is exempted from coverage under this subsection and injured in this State while working for the employer of the individual, the sole remedy of the individual is the workers\u2019 compensation or similar law of the state on which the exemption is based.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-8\">(3) A certificate from an authorized officer of the workers\u2019 compensation commission or similar unit of another state certifying that the employer is insured in that state and has provided extraterritorial insurance coverage for the employees of the employer while working within this State is prima facie evidence that the employer carries that compensation insurance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-9\">(c) Except as otherwise expressly provided, an individual who is employed wholly outside of this State is not a covered employee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b290-10\">In brief, section (a) of L.E. \u00a7 9-203 defines who is covered by the Act and section (b) of L.E. \u00a7 9-203 defines who is not. Therefore, to be eligible for Maryland workers\u2019 compensation benefits, appellant must be a \u201ccovered employee\u201d under one of the three subsections of L.E. \u00a7 9-203(a). While acknowledging that he was neither working for Flippo exclusively in Maryland, which would rendered him a \u201ccovered employee\u201d under L.E. \u00a7 9 \u2014 203(a)(1), nor working \u201cwholly outside of the United States under a contract of employment made in [Maryland],\u201d which would have granted him \u201ccovered employee\u201d status under L.E. \u00a7 9 \u2014 203(a)(3), appellant insists that he was a covered employee under \u00a7 9-203(a)(2). That subsection provides coverage for employees \u201c \u2018regularly\u2019 employed in Maryland while working outside of Maryland on a \u2018casual, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>incidental, or occasional basis.\u2019 \u201d <em>Fitzgerald v. R &amp; R Trucking, Inc., </em>154 Md.App. 86, 92, 838 A.2d 397 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">In determining whether an employee is \u201cregularly employed\u201d in Maryland for \u00a7 9-203(a)(2) purposes, factors such as where the claimant was hired, <em>Pohopek, </em>375 Md. at 594, 826 A.2d 474; whether the employment \u201carrangement eontemplat[ed] a regular presence\u201d in the particular jurisdiction, <em>id. </em>at 592, 826 A.2d 474; the \u201cnature of the employer\u2019s work,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 586, 826 A.2d 474; the \u201cscope and purpose of the hiring,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 587, 826 A.2d 474; the \u201cduration of the employment,\u201d <em>id.; </em>the \u201cconsistency\u201d of the claimant\u2019s work in the particular jurisdiction, <em>Fitzgerald, </em>154 Md.App. at 96, 838 A.2d 397; and representations made by the employer as to where the claimant would be working, <em>L.R. Willson &amp; Sons v. Garrett, </em>76 Md.App. 120, 127, 543 A.2d 875 (1988), may be relevant. Two are not. Neither the claimant\u2019s residence, <em>Dixon v. Able Equipment Company, Inc., </em>107 Md.App. 541, 548, 668 A.2d 1009 (1995), nor the site of the accident, <em>see Pohopek, </em>375 Md. 574, 826 A.2d 474; <em>Fitzgerald, </em>154 Md.App. 86, 838 A.2d 397, is ipso facto relevant to that decision. With that in mind, we turn to the question of what authority does appellant cite, beyond the broad and inclusive language of the statute itself, in support of his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">The answer is one case. He relies exclusively on <em>Pohopek, </em>375 Md. 574, 826 A.2d 474. And so does Flippo. Given that <em>Pohopek </em>presents one of the most recent and comprehensive discussions of the scope of \u00a7 9-203(a) in multi-jurisdictional cases and that its language, when selectively culled, can be placed in the service of either party\u2019s stance, their common choice of authority for their conflicting positions is understandable.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">The <em>Pohopek </em>case received its first appellate review in <em>Pohopek v. McElroy Truck Lines, Inc., </em>140 Md.App. 235, 780 A.2d 383 (2001). The issue before this Court was whether Pohopek, \u201ca Maryland resident, employed as a truck driver by a trucking company based out of state, who was required to keep and maintain the company owned tractor-trailer truck in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>Maryland on weekends, but whose employment involved traveling, during the week, to various states along the Eastern seaboard, including sometimes Maryland, for regular pickups and deliveries, [was] a \u2018covered employee\u2019\u201d under \u00a7 9-203.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Pohopek, </em>375 Md. at 577, 826 A.2d 474. We found that he was \u201cregularly employed\u201d in Maryland, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-5\">This Court has stated that \u201c[t]he word \u2018regular\u2019 implies a uniform course of conduct.\u201d <em>Dixon v. Able Equipment Co., Inc., </em>107 Md.App. 541, 547, 668 A.2d 1009 (1995). Because of Pohopek\u2019s weekend duties and responsibilities, he essentially worked a seven-day work week, spending every Friday through Monday in Maryland, and on the road every Tuesday through Thursday, as well as parts of Monday and Friday. There is \u201cno particular formula for establishing \u2018regular\u2019 employment,\u201d <em>id., </em>and we must evaluate each set of circumstances on a case-by-case basis. Here, the consistency of Pohopek\u2019s schedule and the employment responsibilities he carried out within the State persuade us to find regularity in Pohopek\u2019s Maryland employment. Pohopek was not commuting to work in another state on a daily or regular basis, but, instead, he was based out of Maryland and traveled regularly, albeit extensively, as part of his routine employment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-6\"><em>Pohopek, </em>140 Md.App. at 240-41, 780 A.2d 383.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">But we also found that he was as \u201cregularly employed outside of Maryland as he was within Maryland.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 241, 780 A.2d 383. To resolve this dilemma, we cited language from our decision in <em>Dixon, </em>107 Md.App. 541, 668 A.2d 1009, declaring that \u201cif an employee works outside the State but does not work wholly outside the State, then the employee\u2019s work outside the state is said to be casual.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 242, 668 A.2d 1009. \u201cOur finding that Pohopek regularly works outside the State,\u201d we reasoned, \u201cis inherently a finding that Pohopek does not work wholly outside the State and, therefore ... Pohopek\u2019s work outside the State must be interpreted as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>casual.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In sum, we avowed, \u201cUntil there is a finding of casual employment within the State, the only determinative status of work outside of the State is either \u2018whole\u2019 or \u2018casual.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 242-43, 668 A.2d 1009.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">When this matter reached the Court of Appeals, it agreed with the conclusion of this Court that Pohopek was \u201cregularly employed\u201d in Maryland, commenting:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-6\">The respondent [Pohopek] begins, and ends, his work week in Maryland and the [employer\u2019s] tractor-trailer is kept in Maryland ... the respondent is charged with its safekeeping and the safekeeping of any cargo that it might contain. Moreover, the respondent is responsible for the maintenance of the tractor-trailer. We believe these facts and circumstances suffice to establish that the respondent\u2019s employment in Maryland, rather than being \u201ccasual,\u201d was \u201cregular.\u201d This is consistent with the holding of the Court of Special Appeals, which, as we have seen, relying on the definition of \u201cregular\u201d enunciated in <em>Dixon, </em>i.e. \u201cA uniform course of conduct,\u201d was persuaded by the consistency of the respondent\u2019s schedule and job responsibilities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-7\"><em>Pohopek, 375 </em>Md. at 592, 826 A.2d 474 (quoting <em>Pohopek, </em>140 Md.App. at 240-41, 780 A.2d 383; <em>Dixon, </em>107 Md.App. at 549, 668 A.2d 1009).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">Had it chosen to do so, the Court of Appeals could have stopped there and affirmed the decision of this Court, based upon the rationale of this Court, that only employment \u201cwholly\u201d outside the State would preclude a compensation award to an employee regularly employed in the State. But the Court did not. Choosing instead to take another path to the same destination, it introduced a comparative test for trucking and certain other \u201ctransitory\u201d types of employment. Stressing the unique nature of trucking, which, like \u201c \u2018flying, selling, or construction work\u2019 \u201d is transient in nature, <em>Pohopek, </em>375 Md. at 593, 826 A.2d 474, it quoted with approval the following language from 9 A. Larson &amp; L. Larson, <em>Workers\u2019 Compensation Law </em>\u00a7 143.04[2][c] (2003):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>\u201cIn some kinds of employment, like trucking, flying, selling, or construction work, the employee may be constantly coming and going without spending any longer sustained periods in the local state than anywhere else; but a status rooted in the local state by the original creation of the employment relation there, is not lost merely on the strength of the relative amount of time spent in the local state as against foreign states. An employee loses this status only when his or her regular employment becomes centralized and fixed so clearly in another state that any return to the original state would itself be only casual, incidental and temporary by comparison. This transference will never happen as long as the employee\u2019s presence in any state, even including the original state, is by the nature of the employment brief and transitory.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 593-94, 826 A.2d 474.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">It then noted that, in Maryland, the \u201cdispositive factor\u201d for determining \u201cthe situs of employment relation\u201d for jurisdictional purposes is not \u201cwhere the employment was contracted,\u201d as Larson and several other jurisdictions would have it, <em>id. </em>at 594, 826 A.2d 474, but \u201cwhether the employment in Maryland is regular, compared to the employment outside Maryland.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cThat comparison, when the employment itself is transitory, is between where the employment has been found to be regular,\u201d declared the Court, \u201cand each of the other locations to which the employment has a relationship.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201c[I]t is not,\u201d the Court stressed, \u201cthe whole of the employment outside the State that is considered,\u201d but \u201conly that in some other State that surpasses \u2018casual.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>Quoting Professor Larson for the last time, it repeated his admonition that \u201c \u2018a status rooted in the local state\u2019\u201d is lost only when an employee\u2019s \u201c \u2018regular employment becomes centralized and fixed so clearly in another state that any return to the original state would itself be casual, incidental, and temporary by comparison.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 594-95, 826 A.2d 474. That did not occur, the Court found, in <em>Pohopek. Id. </em>at 595, 826 A.2d 474.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">While Pohopek\u2019s \u201cemployment activity outside of the State dwarfs the amount in State,\u201d his presence in none of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>locations outside of the State, the Court observed, \u201cis substantially greater than in Maryland.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 594, 826 A.2d 474. Having thus narrowed the focus of comparison, the Court concluded that, in contrast to the work he performed in Maryland, Pohopek\u2019s \u201cemployment activity\u201d in the other states, \u201cin which he ma[de] deliveries and pick-ups,\u201d was \u201c \u2018casual, occasional or incidental.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 595, 826 A.2d 474. And that unlocked the door to coverage under L.E. \u00a7 9-203(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">As noted earlier, construction work, like trucking, is a transitory type of employment; thus Hodgson, like Pohopek, belonged to \u201ca unique class of employee whose activity, by its very nature, is transient.\u201d Larson, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 143.04[2][c]. Consequently, we must determine whether Hodgson\u2019s employment was, as he contends, initially \u201crooted\u201d in Maryland and, if so, whether his regular employment thereafter became \u201ccentralized and fixed so clearly\u201d in the District of Columbia that \u201cany return to [Maryland] would itself be only casual, incidental, and temporary by comparison.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">Unfortunately, there is no formula or algorithm upon which we can rely in making that determination. Each case must be decided upon the facts it presents. Under the facts of this case, we are persuaded that Hodgson\u2019s employment, though initially rooted in Maryland, became \u201cfixed.and centralized\u201d in the District of Columbia over the three-year-period leading up to his accident. Indeed, unlike in <em>Pohopek, </em>where the claimant\u2019s presence in none of the other jurisdictions was \u201csubstantially greater than in Maryland,\u201d <em>Pohopek, </em>375 Md. at 594, 826 A.2d 474, appellant\u2019s presence was \u201csubstantially greater\u201d in the District of Columbia for the last three years of his employment than it was in Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">Appellant was hired in Maryland by a Maryland-based company. And, for the first three years of his employment with Flippo, he worked almost exclusively in Maryland. His employment was, to be sure, initially \u201crooted\u201d in Maryland, as he maintains. But that came to an end in 1999, when he was reassigned to work chiefly at D.C. job sites. For the next <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>three years, leading up to his injury at the end of 2001, he worked principally in the District of Columbia. In his brief, he acknowledges that in 1999 he was \u201cprimarily\u201d assigned to D.C. job sites, and that in 2000 his job sites were \u201calmost exclusively in Washington, D.C.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">In 2001, the year preceding his injury, his employment records show, and the circuit court found, that he worked 60.29% of his \u201cfixed job site\u201d time in D.C., while he only spent 20.75% of his \u201cfixed job site\u201d time in Maryland. Moreover, his trips to Maryland to pick up supplies and pay roll documents for his D.C. job sites and his attendance at classes and meetings held at Flippo\u2019s Maryland headquarters, were merely \u201cincidental\u201d or \u201csecondary\u201d to his employment in D.C. <em>See Webster\u2019s New World Dictionary </em>(2d College ed.1984)(defining \u201cincidental\u201d as \u201chappening as a result of or in connection with something more important\u201d; \u201csecondary or minor, but usually associated\u201d). Thus, in comparison to his work in D.C., appellant\u2019s work in Maryland was \u201ccasual, incidental, or occasional.\u201d L.E. \u00a7 9-20S(a)(2). And, finally, appellant does not contend, nor is there any evidence that he will be returning to work primarily in Maryland anytime in the future. Hence, the Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission did not err in finding that appellant was not a \u201ccovered employee\u201d under L.E. \u00a7 9-203(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b287-9\">. Although neither side addresses the relative advantages of filing a claim in Maryland rather than in the District of Columbia, we assume that Mr. Hodgson's interest in the resolution of this issue is more than academic, and that the benefits he would receive from the Maryland Commission are potentially greater than those he would otherwise receive from the D.C.
