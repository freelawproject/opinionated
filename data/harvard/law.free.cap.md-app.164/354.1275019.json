This case presents the question whether an individual who lived with, but was not married to, the deceased worker qualifies for extended benefits if that individual continues to be wholly dependent after the $45,000.00 cap in benefits is attained.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-11\">Appellant, Dicie Weatherly, Personal Representative of the Estate of Edward Bernard Scheibel, resided with, but never married, Mr. Scheibel. After the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission (\u201cCommission\u201d) determined that Ms. Weatherly was wholly dependent upon Mr. Scheibel at the time of his death, she was awarded dependency benefits pursuant to LE \u00a7 9-681. More than three years later, Great Coastal Express Co., Inc. (\u201cGreat Coastal\u201d) and Liberty Mutual Fire Insurance Co. (collectively, \u201cappellees\u201d) informed Ms. Weatherly that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>more than $45,000.00 had been paid to her, and her benefits would cease.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">Ms. Weatherly initiated proceedings before the Commission, arguing that she was entitled to continued dependency benefits. Appellees responded that Ms. Weatherly\u2019s benefits should be terminated on the theory that, under LE \u00a7 9-681, she was not entitled to receive more than $45,000.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">The Commission decided that Ms. Weatherly\u2019s benefits were not required to be capped at $45,000.00. Appellees filed a petition for judicial review of the Commission\u2019s decision in the Circuit Court for Howard County.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">The circuit court reversed the Commission\u2019s decision, ruling that- LE \u00a7 9-681 limits Ms. Weatherly\u2019s benefits to $45,000.00 because she is not a surviving spouse. In her appeal to us, Ms. Weatherly contends that the Commission correctly decided that she was entitled to continued benefits and that the circuit court erred when it reversed the Commission\u2019s order to that effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">For the reasons we discuss below, we agree with the circuit court that the Commission erred as a matter of law when it decided that Ms. Weatherly is entitled to benefits exceeding the $45,000.00 cap. We therefore affirm the circuit court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-9\">FACTS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b382-10\">On December 8, 1999, Edward Bernard Scheibel, an employee of Great Coastal, died after sustaining a work-related injury in an automobile accident on Interstate 95 in Howard County. In July 2000, Ms. Weatherly filed a \u201cDependent\u2019s Claim\u201d -with the Commission. In an order dated October 30, 2000, the Commission found that Mr. Scheibel died after \u201csustain[ing] an accidental injury arising out of and in the course of [his] employment\u201d with Great Coastal. The Commission also found that Ms. Weatherly, who evidently resided with Mr. Scheibel for 30 years before his death, was \u201cwholly dependent\u201d upon him at the time of his injury and death.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>The Commission determined that Mr. Scheibel earned an average weekly wage of $720.40. The Commission therefore ordered appellees to pay $5,000.00 toward Mr. Scheibel\u2019s funeral expenses and to pay Ms. Weatherly \u201ccompensation for her own use and benefit at the rate of $481.00, payable weekly, beginning December 8, 1999 and amounting to $45,000.00 and subject to further payments as provided in [LE \u00a7 ] 9-681 ... so long as [Ms. Weatherly] continues to be wholly dependent[J\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">Appellees requested a rehearing on whether Ms. Weatherly was wholly dependent, and they filed a motion for modification of the order. Appellees did not challenge that aspect of the Commission\u2019s order stating that Ms. Weatherly\u2019s benefits could exceed $45,000.00 \u201csubject to further payments as provided in\u201d the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">The Commission denied appellees\u2019 request for rehearing and motion for modification. Appellees then filed a petition for judicial review of the Commission\u2019s orders in the Circuit Court for Howard County, challenging the Commission\u2019s finding of total dependency. In February 2002, the circuit court entered summary judgment in favor of Ms. Weatherly and affirmed the Commission\u2019s orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">Nearly two years after the initial award of benefits, Ms. Weatherly filed issues with the Commission. The parties stipulated that Mr. Scheibel\u2019s average weekly wage should have been determined to be $764.32, not $720.40. In an order dated October 3, 2002, the Commission corrected its earlier determination of Mr. Scheibel\u2019s average weekly wage and amended its benefits award by directing that appellees pay Ms. Weatherly $510.00 (rather than $481.00) per week.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">On September 11, 2003, the Commission ordered appellees to pay Ms. Weatherly\u2019s attorneys\u2019 fees of $10,000.00. The Commission ordered that, for 85 weeks, $117.65 of her weekly benefits would be used to effectuate that award. At the conclusion of that time period, Ms. Weatherly\u2019s weekly benefits would resume at $510.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>In a letter dated December 3, 2003, counsel for appellees informed Ms. Weatherly that her benefits would be terminated. The letter stated that she had been paid \u201cin excess of $50,000.00 more than [the $45,000.00] she was entitled to under [LE] \u00a7 9-681[ ].\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellees took the position that LE \u00a7 9-681 capped dependency benefits at $45,000.00, and that, because Ms. Weatherly had not been married to Mr. Scheibel, she could not seek additional benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">Ms. Weatherly responded to appellees\u2019 letter by requesting an emergency hearing before the Commission. On January 30, 2004, the Commission held a hearing on the question whether appellees were obligated to pay Ms. Weatherly benefits in excess of $45,000.00. Ms. Weatherly argued that appellees waived the argument that her dependency benefits were capped at $45,000.00, and that, in any event, the statute did not cap her benefits at $45,000.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">In an order dated February 2, 2004, the Commission found that Ms. Weatherly remained wholly dependent upon Mr. Scheibel. The Commission ordered appellees to \u201cpay unto [Ms.] Weatherly, dependency benefits at the rate of $510.00\u201d per week, retroactive to December 3, 2003, pursuant to LE \u00a7 9-681.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Commission did not state why it believed Ms. Weatherly was eligible for the extended benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">On February 25, 2004, appellees filed in the Circuit Court for Howard County a petition for judicial review of the Commission\u2019s February 2, 2004 order. That same day, appellees filed a motion to stay the Commission\u2019s award, a motion for summary judgment, and a motion to shorten time for Ms. Weatherly to respond to the motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>Ms. Weatherly opposed appellees\u2019 motions and requested a hearing. She filed her own motion for summary judgment, arguing, <em>inter alia, </em>that appellees were barred from contesting the Commission\u2019s order by application of the doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel. She also filed a motion for attorneys\u2019 fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">While the petition for judicial review was pending, Ms. Weatherly initiated another emergency hearing with the Commission. She sought enforcement of the Commission\u2019s February 2, 2004 order and requested attorneys\u2019 fees. The Commission held a hearing and, on March 31, 2004, ordered appellees to pay Ms. Weatherly \u201ca 20% penalty on the accrued benefits paid late per the Order of February 2, 2004; and pay unto [Ms. Weatherly\u2019s counsel] an attorney fee in the amount of $500.00.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">Appellees timely filed in the Circuit Court for Howard County a petition for judicial review of that order. Ms. Weatherly moved for summary judgment on the ground that the Commission had jurisdiction to award attorneys\u2019 fees. She also sought attorneys\u2019 fees in the judicial review action and moved to consolidate the two cases then pending in the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">On June 11, 2004, all pending motions came on for a hearing. The court consolidated the cases and, after hearing argument from counsel, orally rendered its ruling on each petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">The court determined that LE \u00a7 9-681 limited Ms. Weatherly\u2019s benefits to a maximum of $45,000.00. The court viewed LE \u00a7 9-681 as expressing the General Assembly\u2019s intent to limit death benefits payable to a claimant to $45,000.00, unless the claimant is \u201ca surviving spouse\u201d or is among a \u201ccertain class[ ] of children.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">The court rejected Ms. Weatherly\u2019s res judicata and collateral estoppel arguments. The court also mentioned that it had not heard any argument concerning whether appellees were entitled to reimbursement of funds they paid to Ms. Weatherly in excess of $45,000.00. On this issue, the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>stated that it likely would not entertain that argument and implied that it would not be inclined to order reimbursement.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">With regard to appellees\u2019 petition for judicial review of the Commission\u2019s February 2, 2004 order, the court granted appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment and denied Ms. Weatherly\u2019s motion, thereby reversing the Commission\u2019s order. The court granted Ms. Weatherly\u2019s summary judgment motion on the petition from the Commission\u2019s March 31, 2004 order, which had assessed a penalty and attorneys\u2019 fees against appellees, thereby affirming that order. Appellees have not appealed that ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">A written order embodying the court\u2019s ruling was docketed on June 25, 2004. Ms. Weatherly noted a timely appeal, raising the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-7\">I. Whether the trial court erred in denying Ms. Weatherly\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the grounds of res judicata and collateral estoppel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-8\">II. Whether the trial court erred in ruling that the Commission erred in its interpretation of LE \u00a7 9-681, and thereby erred in reversing the Commission\u2019s order granting Ms. Weatherly benefits above the $45,000.00 cap.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-9\">III. Whether the trial court erred in denying Ms. Weatherly\u2019s motion for attorneys\u2019 fees on the ground that appellees had filed a frivolous appeal from, and sought a stay of, the Commission\u2019s order.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-10\">We shall add facts as they become pertinent to our discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-11\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b386-12\">Our review of workers\u2019 compensation proceedings is governed by \u00a7 9-745 of the Labor and Employment Article, which in pertinent part provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>(b) <em>Presumption and burden of proof </em>\u2014 In each court proceeding under this title:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-4\">(1) the decision of the Commission is presumed to be prima facie correct; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-5\">(2) the party challenging the decision has the burden of proof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-6\">(c) <em>Determination by court. </em>\u2014 The court shall determine whether the Commission:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-7\">(1) justly considered all of the facts about the accidental personal injury ...;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-8\">(2) exceeded the powers granted to it under this title; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-9\">(3) misconstrued the law and facts applicable in the case decided.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-10\">(e) <em>Disposition. </em>\u2014 (1) If the court determines that the Commission acted within its powers and correctly construed the law and facts, the court shall confirm the decision of the Commission.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-11\">(2) If the court determines that the Commission did not act within its powers or did not correctly construe the law and facts, the court shall reverse or modify the decision or remand the case to the Commission for further proceedings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-12\">Md.Code (1991, 1999 RepLVol.), \u00a7 9-745 of the Labor and Employment Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-13\">\u201c[I]f the requirements of [Maryland] Rule 2 \u2014 501[ ] are met,\u201d a circuit court may enter summary judgment in an appeal from a decision by the Commission. <em>Marshall v.

Vache, </em>349 Md. 526, 537, 709 A.2d 155 (1998)).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">\n<em>Res Judicata and Collateral Estoppel</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">Ms. Weatherly contends that the circuit court erred in denying her motion for summary judgment, because appellees should be precluded by the doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel from asserting the applicability of the $45,000.00 cap on dependency benefits. Ms. Weatherly states that appellees did not raise the cap issue either in prior proceedings before the Commission or in their 2002 petition for judicial review. Citing LE \u00a7 9-736, Ms. Weatherly asserts that appellees should be \u201cestopped\u201d from arguing that her benefits should be capped at $45,000.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">Before addressing these contentions, we clarify what related issues are not before us. Although Ms. Weatherly\u2019s first question presented in her brief characterizes her contention as implicating only res judicata and collateral estoppel, she also asserts, in the argument portion of her brief, a theory under the doctrine of equitable estoppel. During closing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>argument at the hearing on the parties\u2019 respective motions for summary judgment, however, Ms. Weatherly\u2019s counsel stated her agreement with the court\u2019s reasoning that equitable estoppel does not apply in this case. Counsel stated: \u201cThe court has a good point on equitable estoppel and I would concede with that point on the court but 1 would ask this court realistically to look at the issues as presented as, as res judicata, collateral estoppel and then summary judgment on the definition of the statutory code.\u201d This express statement by Ms. Weatherly, through her counsel, constitutes a waiver of her present argument concerning equitable estoppel, and we decline to consider it. <em>See Williams v. Maryland Dep\u2019t of Human Res., </em>136 Md.App. 153, 176, 764 A.2d 351 (2000) (stating that the appellant was precluded from challenging on appeal the grant of summary judgment in the appellees\u2019 favor, after having acquiesced to summary judgment before the circuit court).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">We likewise decline to consider Ms. Weatherly\u2019s argument that appellees are judicially estopped from asserting the cap issue. \u201c[Jjudicial estoppel, also known as the doctrine against inconsistent positions, and estoppel by admission, prevents a party who successfully pursued a position in a prior legal proceeding from asserting a contrary position in a later proceeding.\u201d <em>Chaney, </em>158 Md.App. at 40, 854 A.2d 233 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">Ms. Weatherly did not raise judicial estoppel in the circuit court, and raises it for the first time in her reply brief. For two reasons, then, the argument is not properly before us. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 8-131(a); <em>Beck v. Mangels, </em>100 Md.App. 144, 149, 640 A.2d 236 (1994) (stating that \u201cMd. Rule 8-504(a)(5) requires a party to present \u2018argument in support of the party\u2019s position,\u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u2018to present <em>and argue </em>all points of appeal <em>in [her] initial brief\u2019 </em>\u201d) (citations omitted) (some emphasis added), ce<em>rt. dismissed, </em>337 Md. 580, 655 A.2d 370 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">We now consider the arguments that are properly before us. Ms. Weatherly argues that, by operation of the doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel, appellees are foreclosed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>from challenging the Commission\u2019s award to her of benefits above the $45,000.00 cap. Appellees respond that neither doctrine bars their claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">The doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel are two \u201cbranches of a doctrine known as estoppel by judgment!;.]\u201d <em>Klein v. Whitehead, </em>40 Md.App. 1, 13, 389 A.2d 374, <em>cert. denied, </em>283 Md. 734 (1978). Res judicata and collateral estoppel have the same function: \u201c \u2018to avoid the expense and vexation of multiple lawsuits, conserve judicial resources, and foster reliance on judicial action by minimizing the possibilities of inconsistent decisions.\u2019 \u201d <em>Colandrea v. Wilde Lake Cmty. Ass\u2019n, </em>361 Md. 371, 387, 761 A.2d 899 (2000) (citation omitted). Yet the doctrines are distinct from, one another. <em>Id. </em>at 387-88, 761 A.2d 899.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">The Court of Appeals has said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-6\"><em>Res judicata </em>literally means \u201ca thing adjudicated,\u201d and generally indicates \u201c[a]n affirmative defense barring the same parties from litigating a second lawsuit on the same claim, or any other claim arising from the same transaction or series of transactions and that could have been \u2014 but was not \u2014 raised in the first suit.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-7\"><em>Lizzi v.

Even so, neither doctrine assists Ms. Weatherly.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">We first consider collateral estoppel. Whether Ms. Weatherly has the entitlement to receive dependency benefits in excess of $45,000.00 was a question not litigated until appellees ceased making payments to Ms. Weatherly and she requested an emergency hearing on the issue. Because the issue was not \u201cactually determined,\u201d in a prior proceeding, Ms. Weatherly could not successfully rely upon that doctrine to bar appellees\u2019 claim. The court properly rejected the argument as a basis for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">The court was also correct to deny Ms. Weatherly summary judgment on the ground of res judicata. This doctrine applies only if appellees did not raise, but could have raised, the issue of Ms. Weatherly\u2019s entitlement to benefits in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>excess of the cap in an earlier proceeding before the Commission or the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">The parties were not involved in litigating whether Ms. Weatherly was entitled to benefits in excess of $45,000.00 until Ms. Weatherly filed issues with the Commission regarding benefits in excess of $45,000.00. Before then, the proceedings focused on whether Ms. Weatherly was wholly dependent upon Mr. Scheibel, whether the appropriate amount of weekly benefits was awarded, and whether she was entitled to attorneys\u2019 fees in that litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">Even if appellees could have raised, at one of these proceedings, the question whether Ms. Weatherly is entitled to benefits above the $45,000.00 cap, we conclude that res judicata does not bar current litigation of that issue. It has been said that the doctrine of res judicata is limited by the application of Maryland Code (1957, 1964 Repl.Vol., 1970 Cum.Supp.), Article 101, \u00a7 40(c), the predecessor to LE \u00a7 9-736(b). <em>See Subsequent Injury Fund v. Baker, </em>40 Md.App. 339, 345, 392 A.2d 94 (1978). LE \u00a7 9-736(b) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-6\">(1) The Commission has continuing powers and jurisdiction over each claim under this title.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-7\">(2) Subject to paragraph (3) of this subsection, the Commission may modify any finding or order as the Commission considers justified.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-8\">(3) Except as provided in subsection (c) of this section, the Commission may not modify an award unless the modification is applied for within 5 years after the latter of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-9\">(i) the date of the accident;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-10\">(ii) the date of disablement; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-11\">(iii) the last compensation payment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-12\">We discussed former \u00a7 40(c) in <em>Baker, </em>40 Md.App. at 345-46, 392 A.2d 94. Our discussion in <em>Baker </em>informs our analysis in the present case, so we shall discuss it at some length.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-13\">In <em>Baker, </em>Carlton Baker sustained an accidental injury during the course of his employment. While recovering, doctors learned that Baker had a form of bone cancer, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>condition antedated his accidental injury. The Subsequent Injury Fund (the \u201cFund\u201d) was impleaded as a party to the case, and the Commission awarded Baker $45,000.00 after it found him permanently and totally disabled. The Commission also found that Baker\u2019s injury caused him to sustain a 40% loss of the use of his right hand, and ordered his employer/insurer to pay $6,667.00 of the award, leaving the Fund to cover the remainder. 40 Md.App. at 340, 392 A.2d 94.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">The employer/insurer appealed the Commission\u2019s decision to the Circuit Court for Baltimore County. The Fund, however, did not file its own appeal or participate in the employer/insurer\u2019s appeal. The circuit court remanded the case to the Commission to reconsider its award. <em>Id. </em>at 340-41, 392 A.2d 94.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">On remand, the Fund raised new issues with the Commission and argued that it was \u201cnot liable for a disability caused by the deterioration of a pre-existing impairment which arises after a subsequent compensable injury!.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 341, 392 A.2d 94. The Commission reaffirmed its earlier award against the employer/insurer, but eliminated its award against the Fund. Baker appealed, and the circuit court restored the Commission\u2019s earlier award against the Fund. The circuit court concluded that, because the fund did not appeal the original award, as had the employer/insurer, that order was res judicata, and barred the Fund from litigating the issue. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">We reversed. We saw the issue as whether res judicata precluded the Commission from reopening and modifying its original award to Baker. <em>Id. </em>at 340-42, 392 A.2d 94. We recognized that it is unclear whether, under Maryland law, principles of res judicata apply to decisions of administrative agencies. We explained that, even if res judicata is applicable to Commission decisions, former Article 101, \u00a7 40(c) limits the effect of res judicata because the statute \u201cnot only gives the Commission continuing jurisdiction over each case, it also invests the Commission with blanket power to make such changes as in its opinion may be justified.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 344-45, 392 A.2d 94. <em>See also Vinci v. Allied Research Assocs., Inc., </em>51 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>Md.App. 517, 522, 444 A.2d 462 (1982) (noting that former Article 101, \u201c \u00a7 40(c) gives the Commission a revisionary power\u201d that allows it to reconsider and revise its earlier decisions \u201cat its discretion\u201d); Gilbert &amp; Humphreys, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 17.8, at 350 (stating that \u201c[i]f <em>res judicata </em>is applicable at all to the Commission\u2019s rulings, it is severely limited by [LE \u00a7 9-736] which provides that the Commission has continuing powers and jurisdiction over each claim\u201d). <em>But cf. Criminal Injuries Comp. Bd. v. Gould, </em>273 Md. 486, 519, 331 A.2d 55 (1975) (noting that \u201cthe doctrine of res judicata has been held not to apply to decisions of administrative agencies,\u201d but concluding that the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Commission\u2019s decision that the claimant \u201cwas an \u2018independent contractor\u2019 was conclusive and not subject to collateral attack by the [Criminal Injuries Compensation] Board\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">In <em>Baker, </em>we characterized former \u00a7 40(c) as \u201cone of the broadest re-opening statutes\u201d in the country because it \u201cnot only gives the Commission continuing jurisdiction over each case, it also invests the Commission with blanket power to make such changes as in its opinion may be justified.\u201d 40 Md.App. at 345, 392 A.2d 94. We said: \u201cIt is settled law in this State that the Commission has the power to re-open a case even for consideration of questions previously decided.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 346, 392 A.2d 94. Consequently, res judicata \u201cis necessarily limited in its effect by\u201d \u00a7 40(c). <em>Id. </em>at 345, 392 A.2d 94.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">We also stated in <em>Baker </em>that nothing in former \u00a7 40(c) \u201cprecluded] the Commission from re-opening a case in which it has mistakenly interpreted the law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 346, 392 A.2d 94. After noting that the circuit court did not make an explicit ruling on the legal issues involved in the case when it remanded to the Commission, we held that the Commission had the authority to re-open the case to decide the issues presented for the first time by the Fund and the insurer/employer. <em>Id. </em>at 348, 392 A.2d 94.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">We briefly discussed <em>Baker </em>in <em>Vinci, supra. </em>We observed that, \u201c[i]n a real sense,\u201d former \u00a7 40(c) \u201cgives the Commission a revisionary power akin to that available to courts under\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>former Maryland Rule 625 (the predecessor to Maryland Rule 2-535) and \u00a7 6-408 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, \u201cbut without the thirty-day limitation.\u201d 51 Md.App. at 522, 444 A.2d 462. We continued: \u201cAs <em>res judicata </em>would not preclude a court from exercising its authority under \u00a7 6-408 or Rule [2-535], so it would not preclude the Commission from exercising its authority under \u00a7 40(c). The Commission is not \u2018irrevocably bound\u2019 by its earlier findings.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\"><em>Baker </em>and <em>Vinci </em>lead us to conclude that, even if res judicata otherwise applies to Commission decisions, LE \u00a7 9-736(b) limits its effect upon prior findings and orders of the Commission.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This conclusion, moreover, comports with common sense. Res judicata bars the relitigation of issues that have been, or <em>could have been, </em>decided in an earlier proceeding. Application of res judicata to cases like the present one would render LE \u00a7 9-736(b) nugatory. The doctrine would prevent relitigation of matters before the Commission that have previously been decided, or that could have been decided, by the Commission. LE \u00a7 9-736(b), however, expressly confers upon the Commission the authority to do precisely what the doctrine of res judicata would prevent.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">Further support for our conclusion that res judicata does not bar appellees\u2019 challenge to the Commission\u2019s award of continued benefits under LE \u00a7 9-681 is found in LE \u00a7 9-681 itself. LE \u00a7 9-681 (j) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">The Commission has continuing jurisdiction to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-7\">(1) determine whether a surviving spouse or child has become wholly or partly self-supporting;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-8\">(2) suspend or terminate payments of compensation; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-9\">(3) reinstate payments of compensation that have been suspended or terminated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b398-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>By its express wording, LE \u00a7 9-681(j) permits the Commission to revisit previously decided awards of dependency benefits. It seems readily to follow that res judicata, even if otherwise applicable to Commission decisions, does not apply to bar challenges to an award, even if the challenge could have been raised at an earlier time.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">In sum, the question whether appellees <em>could have </em>raised the issue of the statutory cap in an earlier proceeding before the Commission is of little concern. That they <em>could have </em>raised the issue at an earlier proceeding does not preclude them from challenging the dependency benefits award to Ms. Weatherly, because the Commission possesses the continuing jurisdiction to \u201cmodify any finding or order,\u201d LE \u00a7 9-736(b)(2), and, in particular, to revisit dependency benefits awards, LE \u00a7 9-681(j). In this case, the Commission revisited the original award of dependency benefits to Ms. Weatherly, to decide whether LE \u00a7 9-681 authorized her to continue to receive benefits beyond the statutory $45,000.00 cap, even though she is not a \u201csurviving spouse.\u201d Res judicata did not bar appellees from arguing, for the first time at that juncture, that Ms. Weatherly is not legally entitled to seek benefits exceeding the statutory cap.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">\n<em>Interpretation of LE \u00a7 9-681</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">We now consider whether the circuit court correctly interpreted LE \u00a7 9-681. That section is entitled \u201cWholly dependent individuals\u201d and provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-8\">(a) <em>In general. </em>\u2014 If there are individuals who were wholly dependent on a deceased covered employee at the time of death resulting from an accidental personal injury or occupational disease, the employer or its insurer shall pay death benefits in accordance with this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-9\">(c) <em>Duration of payment </em>\u2014 In <em>general. </em>\u2014 Except as otherwise provided in this section, the employer or its insurer shall pay the weekly death benefit:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-10\">(1) for the period of total dependency; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>(2) until $45,000 has been paid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-4\">(d) <em>Same </em>\u2014 Surviving <em>spouse who remains wholly dependent. </em>\u2014 If a surviving spouse who was wholly dependent at the time of death continues to be wholly dependent after $45,000 has been paid, the employer or its insurer shall continue to make payments to the surviving spouse at the same weekly rate during the total dependency of the surviving spouse.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-5\">(e) <em>Same </em>\u2014 Surviving <em>spouse who becomes self-supporting. </em>\u2014 (1) If a surviving spouse who is wholly dependent at the time of death becomes wholly self-supporting before $45,000 has been paid, the employer or its insurer shall continue to pay death benefits until $45,000 has been paid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-6\">(f) <em>Same </em>\u2014 Surviving <em>spouse who remarries. </em>\u2014 (1) Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, if a surviving spouse who is wholly dependent remarries, payment to the surviving spouse shall stop on the date of remarriage, even if $45,000 has not been paid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-7\">(g) <em>Same </em>\u2014 Child <em>who remains wholly dependent. </em>\u2014 If a surviving child continues to be wholly dependent after the total amount of $45,000 has been paid, the employer or its insurer shall continue to make payments at the same weekly rate during the total dependency of the surviving child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-8\">(h) <em>Same </em>\u2014 Child <em>who becomes self-supporting. </em>\u2014 Except as provided in subsection (i) of this section, if a child who is wholly dependent at the time of death becomes wholly or partly self-supporting, the employer or its insurer shall continue to pay death benefits until $45,000 has been paid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-9\">(i) <em>Same </em>\u2014 Child <em>who becomes 18. </em>\u2014 (1) Except as provided in paragraphs (2) and (3) of this subsection, the employer or its insurer shall continue to make payments to, or for the benefit of, a surviving child until the child reaches 18 years of age.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>(j) <em>Continuing jurisdiction of Commission. </em>\u2014 The Commission has continuing jurisdiction to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-4\">(1) determine whether a surviving spouse or child has become wholly or partly self-supporting;....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">The question before us is whether, under LE \u00a7 9-681, a person who is not a surviving spouse or child of a deceased covered employee, but who was wholly dependent upon the deceased employee at the time of the employee\u2019s death and continues to be wholly dependent, is entitled to dependency benefits in excess of $45,000.00. Ms. Weatherly finds ambiguity in the statute\u2019s provisions concerning extended benefits. She contends that it is unclear whether the employer/insurer is liable \u201cfor the payment of benefits [beyond $45,000.00] to wholly dependent individuals other than a spouse and child.\u201d She does not argue that she should be considered a \u201cspouse\u201d of Mr. Scheibel. She argues, instead, that the entire statutory scheme and its benevolent purposes dictate the conclusion that there is no $45,000.00 \u201ccap\u201d on benefits payable to a non-spouse of a deceased covered employee who continues to be wholly dependent.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">Appellees do not dispute that Ms. Weatherly was wholly dependent upon Mr. Scheibel at the time of his death, remained wholly dependent through the time $45,000.00 was paid to her, or even that she is wholly dependent today. They argue, however, that LE \u00a7 9-681 unambiguously provides that only spouses and children of the decedent are eligible to receive benefits beyond $45,000.00, and Ms. Weatherly, as a non-spouse, is ineligible.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">Our analysis of this issue is guided by the following familiar language, restated recently by the Court of Appeals in <em>Johnson, </em>387 Md. at 11, 874 A.2d 439:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-8\">We remind ourselves that the cardinal rule of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate the intention of the legislature. <em>O\u2019Connor v.

Yet, several decisions are helpful in setting the stage for our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\"><em>Martin, supra, </em>involved \u201cwhether the phrase \u2018continues to be wholly dependent,\u2019 as found in [the Act] refers to an ongoing dependency on the deceased worker\u2019s wages or the generally lesser amount of workers\u2019 compensation benefits.\u201d 353 Md. at 393, 726 A.2d 728 (footnote omitted). \u201c[T]here is a two-step process for determining the initial receipt and continuation of workers\u2019 compensation death benefits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 400, 726 A.2d 728. The first step requires a determination whether the claimant is wholly dependent under Maryland Code (1991, 1999 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 9-679 of the Labor and Employment Article, and is therefore \u201centitled to receive benefits up to the $45,000.00 maximum\u201d pursuant to LE \u00a7 9-681(a) through (c). <em>Id. </em>The second step, which arises once the $45,000.00 maximum has been paid, requires that a surviving <em>spouse </em>seeking further benefits \u201cprove that he or she \u2018continues to be wholly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>dependent\u2019 under [LE] \u00a7 9-681(d).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 400-01, 726 A.2d 728.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">There is no controversy in the present case regarding step one. In 2000 the Commission found Ms. Weatherly wholly dependent upon Mr. Scheibel and ordered appellees to pay benefits to her \u201camounting to $45,000.00 and subject to further payments as provided in [LE \u00a7 ] 9-681 ... so long as [Ms. Weatherly] continues to be wholly dependent[.]\u201d The controversy concerns step two: whether Ms. Weatherly, though not a surviving spouse or child of Mr. Scheibel, is entitled to prove that she \u201ccontinues to be wholly dependent\u201d on him and therefore should continue to receive dependency benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">The opinion of the Court of Appeals in <em>Ryder Truck Lines, Inc. v. Kennedy, </em>296 Md. 528, 468 A.2d 850 (1983), instructs us about step two. In that case, Ernest John Grass, Jr. (\u201cGrass\u201d), was lawfully married to one woman but was living with another, Donna Kennedy (\u201cKennedy\u201d) and her two minor children (one of whom he had fathered), when he died in an automobile accident in Virginia. Grass\u2019s wife sought and received survivors\u2019 benefits from the Industrial Accident Commission of the Commonwealth of Virginia (\u201cVirginia Commission\u201d). Later, both she and Kennedy filed claims with the Commission in Maryland. The Commission awarded benefits to Kennedy but denied benefits to Grass\u2019s wife. The Commission also refused to offset the award to Kennedy based on the award given by the Virginia Commission to Grass\u2019s wife. The circuit court affirmed. The Court of Appeals granted <em>certiorari </em>before a decision by this Court, and affirmed. <em>Id. </em>at 529-30, 540, 463 A.2d 850.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">The question before the <em>Kennedy </em>Court was whether Kennedy could receive benefits <em>(i.e., </em>the first step identified by the <em>Martin </em>Court). <em>Id. </em>at 530, 463 A.2d 850. The Court held that the Act \u201cprohibits the same dependent who recovers a compensation award in a foreign state from recovering total compensation in Maryland for the same injury greater than is provided in [the Act].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 539, 463 A.2d 850.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>In reaching this conclusion, the Court discussed various provisions of the Act. The Court noted that \u201cvarious persons who are not spouses or children\u201d may receive workers\u2019 compensation benefits in accordance with the Act. <em>See id. </em>at 532-33 n. 4, 463 A.2d 850, and cases cited therein. They may do so because, during the first step of the dependency process, dependency, not a marital or another familial relation, \u201cis the decisive factor in determining who will receive a compensation award.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 532-33, 463 A.2d 850.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">The <em>Kennedy </em>Court did not have before it the issue we decide in this case. Even so, the Court stated that former Maryland Code (1957, 1979 Repl.Vol.), Article 101, \u00a7 36(8) (the predecessor to LE \u00a7 9-681), placed a cap of $45,000.00 on benefits paid to persons determined to be wholly dependent. <em>Id. </em>at 533, 463 A.2d 850. Citing former \u00a7 36(8)(a), the Court stated that, after $45,000.00 had been paid, \u201ca surviving wife or husband who remains wholly dependent may continue to receive payments at the same rate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court also pointed out \u201cthat <em>other states recognizing actual dependency also provide for potentially extended compensation for spouses or children while not allowing other dependents </em>to receive more than the basic award.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 533-34 n. 5, 463 A.2d 850 (emphasis added). That observation at least suggests a recognition by the Court that non-spouses are not entitled to seek benefits above the statutory cap.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">Even without the benefit of the <em>Kennedy </em>Court\u2019s intimations on the issue, we have no difficulty concluding that the language of LE \u00a7 9-681 is unambiguous. Under subsection (a), <em>any </em>claimant who was \u201cwholly dependent on the deceased covered employee at the time of death from an accidental personal injury or occupational disease\u201d is entitled to receive dependency benefits. Under subsection (c), the benefits are \u201ccapped\u201d at $45,000.00, except in certain circumstances identified in LE \u00a7 9 \u2014 681(d) through (i). Those subsections, however, delineate instances when a <em>spouse </em>or <em>child </em>of the deceased covered employee may be eligible to receive continuing benefits above $45,000.00. By placing a cap on benefits for any claimant at $45,000.00, but expressly providing for circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>stances under which a <em>spouse </em>or <em>child </em>of the deceased covered employee is eligible to receive benefits above the $45,000.00 cap, the General Assembly necessarily excluded all claimants who are neither surviving spouses nor children of the deceased employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\">Ms. Weatherly argues that she is entitled to the benefits accorded a surviving spouse, even if that entitlement is not explicitly authorized under the Act. The recent <em>Johnson </em>decision of the Court of Appeals explains why this argument fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">In <em>Johnson, </em>the Court considered whether the petitioners, widows of Baltimore City firefighters, \u201cmay collect the service pension benefits in addition to the full workers\u2019 compensation death benefits, or whether the workers\u2019 compensation death benefits must be reduced by the amount of service pension benefits the widows are currently receiving.\u201d 387 Md. at 3, 874 A.2d 439. The Court reviewed the interplay between LE \u00a7 9-503 and Maryland Code (1991, 1999 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 9-610 of the Labor and Employment Article, and concluded that the statutory language of each \u201cis clear and unambiguous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 7-10, 22, 874 A.2d 439. The Court held that, although a firefighter or other public safety employee suffering from a certain occupational disease could collect dual workers\u2019 compensation and service pension benefits while alive, in the absence of a statutory provision the same ability to collect did not extend \u201cto the dependents of those individuals.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 22, 874 A.2d 439. Instead, unless the General Assembly changes the statutory scheme, the amount of workers\u2019 compensation death benefits collected by a dependent must be offset by the amount that person receives from the deceased employee\u2019s service pension. <em>Id. </em>at 21-22, 874 A.2d 439.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">We answer Ms. Weatherly\u2019s argument with these words from <em>Johnson: </em>\u201cThe Legislature is often faced with balancing opposing interests and making difficult choices. This case discusses some of the lines drawn by the Legislature....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2, 874 A.2d 439. Like <em>Johnson, </em>this case involves an instance of legislative line-drawing. In the realm of dependency benefits, surviving spouses and children stand on one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>side of the line, and all other \u201cwholly dependent\u201d individuals stand on the other. As in <em>Johnson, </em>the issue raised by Ms. Weatherly\u2019s appeal \u201chas been addressed and decided by the Legislature.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 3, 874 A.2d 439. The General Assembly has determined that, because Ms. Weatherly is not a surviving spouse, her benefits are capped at $45,000.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\"><em>Johnson </em>also supplies the response to Ms. Weatherly\u2019s reliance on <em>Breitenbach, supra. </em>In <em>Breitenbach, </em>the Court of Appeals had to decide whether a provision in the Act requires an employer and insurer to reimburse an employee for the cost of travel to and from a medical treatment provider. The Court determined that the provision is ambiguous, and concluded that the ambiguity should be resolved in the claimant\u2019s favor. 366 Md. at 484, 784 A.2d 569. <em>Johnson </em>and the present case, however, involve construction of sections of the Act that are clear and unambiguous. Moreover, in <em>Breitenbach, </em>other sections of the Act assisted in the interpretation of an ambiguous provision of the Act dealing with coverage for transportation expenses, <em>id. </em>at 481-85, 784 A.2d 569, whereas the sections at issue in the present case, and those at issue in <em>Johnson, </em>deal with benefits. Nowhere else in the Act are dependency benefits addressed in a manner that implies a general entitlement to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">We are mindful that some might view the Act as inequitable in its treatment of non-spousal dependency benefits. Yet, as the Court of Appeals explained in <em>Gleneagles, Inc. v. Hanks, </em>385 Md. 492, 504-05, 869 A.2d 852 (2005), any inequity in the Act must be resolved by the General Assembly, if it so chooses:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-7\">We have previously discussed seeming inequities in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act and concluded that the Legislature must be the body to remedy any unfairness, should they consider it necessary. As stated in <em>Paul v. Glidden </em>[Co.], 184 Md. 114[, 119, 39 A.2d 544] (1944),</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-8\">[t]he Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act was passed to promote the general welfare of the State and to prevent the State and its taxpayers from having to care for injured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>workmen and their dependents, when under the law as it previously existed, such workmen could not recover damages for their injuries. There were, in its first enactment, certain inequalities which have, from time to time, been corrected by amendment. There may be a need for further amendment. As to this, we express no opinion, as it is not within our province. Some of the present provisions may be inequitable. To consider this, is also outside the scope of our duties. The enactment is made in pursuance of the police power ... and the details must be left to the judgment of the Legislature, unless some basic right is infringed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">We cannot read into the Act a benefit the legislative body chose not to provide.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">\n<em>Denial of Motion for Attorneys\u2019 Fees</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">Finally, Ms. Weatherly asserts that appellees\u2019 appeal to the circuit court and their motion to stay the Commission\u2019s February 2, 2004 order were \u201cfrivolous\u201d because Maryland Code (1991, 1999 Repl.Vol), \u00a7 9-741 of the Labor and Employment Article, clearly and unambiguously provides that a circuit court may not stay an award of the Commission. She argues, from this, that the court erred in refusing to award attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">Ms. Weatherly, however, never asked the court to rule on her motion for attorneys\u2019 fees at the June 11, 2004 motions hearing. Critical to our determination of an issue on appeal is the trial court\u2019s opportunity to consider the issue. <em>See Tretick v. Layman, </em>95 Md.App. 62, 74, 619 A.2d 201 (1993) (quoting <em>Braun v. Ford Motor Co., </em>32 Md.App. 545, 548, 363 A.2d 562, <em>cert. denied, </em>278 Md. 716 (1976), for the proposition that \u201c \u2018error in a trial court may be committed <em>only by a fudge, </em>and <em>only when he rules, or, in rare instances, fails to rule, </em>on a question <em>raised before him in the course of a trial, </em>or in pre-trial or post-trial proceedings\u2019 \u201d) (alteration in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>At the outset of the motions hearing, the court stated that it was aware of the pending motions, including Ms. Weatherly\u2019s \u201crequest for fees and costs.\u201d Throughout the hearing, both parties presented argument on the various motions for summary judgment. The court granted appellees\u2019 motion regarding the Commission\u2019s February 2, 2004 order, and denied Ms. Weatherly\u2019s motion in that case. The court also granted Ms. Weatherly\u2019s motion for summary judgment regarding the Commission\u2019s March 31, 2004 order.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">The court then asked counsel, \u201cGood enough?\u201d Both counsel responded by thanking the court and agreeing to collaborate on a proposed written order to submit for the court\u2019s signature. Ms. Weatherly did not request, then or thereafter, a ruling on her motion for attorneys\u2019 fees, and no ruling on that motion appears in the court\u2019s written order, the docket entries, or any other place in the record. Ms. Weatherly may not be heard to complain now about a ruling the court was never asked to make. <em>See </em>Md.
