The State sought to prove that appellant had violated \u00a7 21-801 (a) by establishing that he drove 55 miles per hour (\u201cmph\u201d) in a 40-mph zone. The State sought to prove that appellant drove while impaired by relying on the lay opinion testimony of three police officers that he was \u201cdrunk,\u201d \u201cdriving under the influence of alcohol,\u201d and \u201chighly impaired by alcohol.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b178-10\">Appellant attacks his conviction under \u00a7 21-801 (a), arguing that excessive speed does not come within the purview of that section, and that the State provided no evidence of the conduct that \u00a7 21-801 (a) does cover, <em>%.e., </em>failure to drive at a speed that is reasonable and prudent in light of existing conditions that create \u201cactual and potential dangers.\u201d Appellant attacks his DWI conviction on the ground that the court should not have permitted the officers\u2019 lay opinion testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>Because we agree with appellant that the evidence was legally insufficient to establish a violation of \u00a7 21-801(a), we shall reverse that conviction. We shall affirm appellant\u2019s DWI conviction, finding no merit in his argument that the officers\u2019 opinion testimony was inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">FACTS '</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">At approximately 10:30 p.m. on May 5, 2003, Officer John Kennedy, a ten-year veteran of the Montgomery County Police Department, was sitting in his marked patrol vehicle in the parking lot of the \u201cOn the Border\u201d restaurant on Rockville Pike. The officer saw a man, later identified as appellant, approximately twenty yards away, walking away from the officer and heading toward a Ford Thunderbird. Officer Kennedy described appellant as \u201cstaggering across the parking lot with his shoulders slouched over, swaying, wobbly knees, you know, just very unsteady on his feet[.]\u201d Although he fumbled with the keys, appellant eventually unlocked the driver\u2019s side door. He got into the car, sat in the driver\u2019s seat for about ten minutes, and repeatedly looked over at Officer Kennedy. Appellant then got out of the car and \u201cstaggered, stumbling ... back into the bar[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">Officer Kennedy left the area to perform his \u201cregular patrol duties.\u201d When he returned to the parking lot about two hours later, he noticed that the Thunderbird was still parked where he had last seen it. Because he thought that appellant had not looked \u201clike he was in any condition ... to drive,\u201d and had seemed \u201cvery intoxicated,\u201d Officer Kennedy set up surveillance about 100 yards away from the car, on the opposite side of the street.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">Shortly thereafter, Officer Kennedy saw appellant drive the Thunderbird onto Rockville Pike. Officer Kennedy followed the car and a second officer, Officer Craig Cupiello, followed behind him.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-9\">Appellant made \u201ca very wide turn\u201d off of Rockville Pike onto Edmonston Drive, a two-lane road with parking on each side. He drove a little more than one-tenth of a mile \u201cusing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>the full width of the road[,] ... going from side to side, up the road.\u201d Appellant then turned right onto Veirs Mill Road and rapidly accelerated, still drifting between lanes. Officer Kennedy \u201cpaced\u201d appellant for approximately two-tenths of a mile, and determined that he was traveling 55 mph in a 40-mph zone. The officer activated his emergency lights, and appellant stopped his car.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">Officer Kennedy approached the driver\u2019s side door of the car, and \u201cdetected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage.\u201d The officer also noticed that appellant\u2019s eyes were watery and bloodshot. When the officer asked appellant for his driver\u2019s license, appellant removed his wallet from his pocket and fumbled through it, passing over the license several times. Appellant was mumbling and his speech was so \u201cextremely slurred\u201d that the officer could not understand what he was saying.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">At that time, Officer Kennedy told appellant to turn off the ignition and exit the car. Appellant did not respond to the officer\u2019s request. The officer asked him three more times and, each time, appellant failed to respond. Officer Kennedy testified that he feared for the safety of the citizens present in the area should appellant drive off. He therefore took out his Taser, pointed it at appellant, and told him that if he did not get out of the car, he was going to \u201cget stunned.\u201d Appellant still did not respond. The officer then pushed his Taser, set to stun, against appellant\u2019s shoulder.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">Appellant released his grip on the steering wheel and Officer Kennedy \u201chelp[ed] him get out of the car.\u201d Because appellant was very wobbly and unsteady on his feet, the officer leaned him against the car. The officer asked appellant to perform field sobriety tests, but appellant refused. Officer Kennedy placed appellant under arrest and transported him to the Rockville District station for processing.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>Appellant collapsed while walking up the steps of the station. Sergeant Tim Falcinelli assisted Officer Kennedy in taking appellant the rest of the way to the processing room. Once they arrived, the officers asked appellant to take a breath test to determine his blood alcohol level, but appellant refused. After sitting at the processing table for about fifteen minutes, appellant \u201cvomited all over the processing [room] floor.\u201d Officer Kennedy opined, based on his training and personal experience, that appellant was \u201chighly impaired by alcohol.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">Officer Cupiello testified that after Officer Kennedy stopped appellant\u2019s vehicle, he, Officer Cupiello, walked to the passenger\u2019s side of appellant\u2019s car. When appellant finally exited the vehicle, Officer Cupiello saw that appellant had \u201cbloodshot, watery eyes,\u201d and \u201can odor of an alcoholic beverage.\u201d The officer observed that appellant seemed confused and incoherent. He opined that appellant was \u201cdriving under the influence of alcohol.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">Sergeant Falcinelli testified that appellant was \u201cdrunk\u201d when he came into the station house. Appellant could not walk, \u201creeked\u201d of alcohol, slurred his words, had \u201cwatery, red, [bloodshot] eyes,\u201d and acted confused. He opined that appellant was \u201cunder the influence of alcohol.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">Appellant testified in his defense. He said that he was on his way home from work when he stopped at a restaurant with two friends. He had one beer at the bar. He was not feeling well, so he went outside to get some fresh air. He was not walking normally because of a foot injury. He testified that he sat in his car \u201c[t]o get away from all the crowd, the noise, the smoke[, and] ... to clear [his] head a little bit.\u201d After about ten minutes, he returned to the bar and attempted to have a second drink, but was not feeling well enough to finish it.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">Appellant testified that his driving on the evening in question was not inhibited by alcohol or otherwise inappropriate. According to appellant, when Officer Kennedy stopped and approached his car, the officer immediately asked him to get <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>out of it. Appellant asked the officer several times whether he wanted to see appellant\u2019s license and registration, but the officer simply repeated \u201ca couple of\u2019 times his request for appellant to get out of the car. The officer then used his Taser without warning. Appellant explained that his subsequent behavior was the result of the Taser stun.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">The jury convicted appellant of driving while impaired and driving in excess of a reasonable and prudent speed, and acquitted him of the charge of driving under the influence of alcohol.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court sentenced appellant to 60 days\u2019 imprisonment for driving while impaired, suspending all but 30 days, with 18 months\u2019 supervised probation upon release. The court imposed a $75.00 fine for appellant\u2019s conviction for driving in excess of a reasonable and prudent speed.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">Appellant noted this timely appeal, presenting the following questions for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-7\">I. Was the evidence sufficient to sustain appellant\u2019s conviction for driving in excess of a reasonable and prudent speed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-8\">II. Did the trial court abuse its discretion in admitting lay opinion testimony that appellant was \u201cdrunk,\u201d \u201cunder the influence of alcohol,\u201d and \u201chighly impaired by alcohol\u201d?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b182-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-11\">Appellant argues that there was insufficient evidence to sustain his conviction, under \u00a7 21-801 (a), for driving in excess of a reasonable and prudent speed. He acknowledges that there was evidence that he exceeded the posted speed limit, a violation of \u00a7 21-801.1.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He insists, however, there was no evidence of any \u201cspecial danger\u201d on the road, which, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>maintains, is necessary to sustain his conviction under \u00a7 21-801(a). We agree with appellant, and hold that, because the State presented no evidence of \u201cactual and potential dangers\u201d requiring him to reduce his speed to a reasonable and prudent level, the conviction under \u00a7 21-801(a) must be reversed.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-4\">Section 21-801, entitled \u201cBasic rule,\u201d provides:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-5\">(a) <em>Reasonableness and prudence required,.\u2022 </em>\u2014 A person may not drive a vehicle on a highway at a speed that, with regard to the actual and potential dangers existing, is more than that which is reasonable and prudent under the conditions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-6\">(b) <em>Driver to control speed. </em>\u2014 At all times, the driver of a vehicle on a highway shall control the speed of the vehicle as necessary to avoid colliding with any person or any vehicle or other conveyance that, in compliance with legal requirements and the duty of all persons to use due care, is on or entering the highway.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-7\">(c) <em>Drivers to reduce speed in ceriain circumstances.\u2014 </em>Consistent with the requirements of this section, the driver of a vehicle shall drive at an appropriate, reduced speed when approaching and crossing an intersection at which cross traffic is not required to stop by a traffic control device.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-8\">(d) <em>Approaching and crossing railroad grade crossings. </em>\u2014 Consistent with the requirements of this section, the driver of a vehicle shall drive at an appropriate, reduced speed when approaching and crossing a railroad grade crossing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-9\">(e) <em>Approaching and going around curves. </em>\u2014 Consistent with the requirements of this section, the driver of a vehicle shall drive at an appropriate, reduced speed when approaching and going around a curve.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-10\">(f) <em>Approaching crests of grades. </em>\u2014 Consistent with the requirements of this section, the driver of a vehicle shall drive at an appropriate, reduced speed when approaching the crest of a grade.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>(g) <em>Traveling on narrow or winding roadways. </em>\u2014 Consistent with the requirements of this section, the driver of a vehicle shall drive at an appropriate, reduced speed when traveling on any narrow or winding roadway.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-5\">(h) <em>Special dangers as to pedestrians or other </em>traffic.\u2014 Consistent with the requirements of this section, the driver of a vehicle shall drive at an appropriate, reduced speed when any special danger exists as to pedestrians or other traffic or because of weather or highway conditions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">The primary rule of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate legislative intent. <em>See, e.g., Pete v. State, </em>384 Md. 47, 57, 862 A.2d 419 (2004). We begin the analysis by examining the plain language of the statute, \u201cfor the legislative intent of a statute primarily reveals itself through the statute\u2019s very, words.\u201d <em>Price v. State, </em>378 Md. 378, 387, 835 A.2d 1221 (2003) (citations omitted). We are cautioned not to add or delete language in a way that indicates an intent not reflected by the plain and unambiguous language of the statute. <em>Pete, </em>384 Md. at 57, 862 A.2d 419. \u201c[N]or may [we] construe the statute with forced or subtle interpretations that limit or extend its application.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cStatutes on the same subject are to be read together and harmonized to the extent possible[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 65, 862 A.2d 419 (citations and quotation marks omitted). \u201cIf the words of a statute are clear and unambiguous, our inquiry ordinarily ends and we need investigate no further, but simply apply the statute as it reads.\u201d <em>Gillespie v. State, </em>370 Md. 219, 222, 804 A.2d 426 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">Section 21-801 is located in subtitle 8 of the Transportation Article and is entitled \u201cSpeed Restrictions.\u201d Subsection (a) of \u00a7 21-801 prohibits driving at a speed that is <em>\u201cmore </em>than that which is reasonable and prudent\u201d under the prevailing circumstances. (Emphasis added.) What is \u201creasonable and prudent\u201d is dictated by existing \u201cconditions.\u201d Subsections (c) through (h) set forth specific conditions requiring a reduced speed: when there is special danger to pedestrians or other traffic, poor weather conditions, and when approaching any of the following: an intersection at which traffic is not controlled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>by a traffic control device; a railroad crossing; a curve; a crest of a hill; or when traveling on a narrow or winding road.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">Subsections (a) and (b) are more general. Nonetheless, both of those subsections apply only when certain driving conditions prevail. Subsection (a) refers to \u201cactual and potential dangers\u201d and prohibits driving under those \u201cconditions\u201d at a speed that is unreasonable or imprudent. Subsection (b) requires the driver to control the vehicle\u2019s speed when a collision with a person or vehicle might occur. Read in its entirety, \u00a7 21-801 plainly requires drivers to reduce speed, from what otherwise would be a lawful maximum speed, to that which is reasonable or prudent in light of existing conditions that present an \u201cactual or potential danger.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">This construction of \u00a7 21-801 makes sense in light of, and is in harmony with, \u00a7 21-801.1. The latter section prohibits speed over a specified maximum speed limit. The specified speed is governed by highway type (divided or undivided) and location (business, residential, or \u201cother locations\u201d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>21-801.1(a) includes the caveat that the statutory maximum designated speed pertains, \u201c[u]nless there is a special danger that requires a lower speed to comply with \u00a7 21-801 [.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">The State argues that this quoted language from \u00a7 21-801.1(a) applies to subsections (c)-(h) of \u00a7 21-801, but not to subsections (a) and (b). We disagree. Nothing in \u00a7 21-801.1(a) suggests such a limited reading of it. Moreover, the narrow interpretation advanced by the State does not make common sense. And, if indeed the Maryland General Assembly intended the language in \u00a7 21-801.1(a) to apply only to \u00a7 21-801(c)-(h), it certainly knew how to make that clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">The State argues that excessive speed (in this case, driving 55 mph in a 40-mph zone) can create the \u201cactual or potential danger\u201d under \u00a7 21-801(a). Though excessive speed certainly may be an actual or potential danger, we disagree that excessive speed is a \u201ccondition\u201d of the sort envisioned by the Legislature when it enacted \u00a7 21-801. As we have said, \u00a7 21-801 addresses circumstances under which speed must be reduced. Further, the plain language of the section suggests <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>that the conditions requiring a reduced speed under \u00a7 21-801 are not those created by driving behavior, but rather are those external conditions to which a driver must react.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">The State also argues that evidence of appellant\u2019s erratic driving (making a wide right turn and weaving in and out of lanes), created an actual or potential danger sufficient to sustain his conviction under \u00a7 21-801(a). Again, the State is only half right. Driving erratically, like speeding, can create an actual or potential danger. But \u00a7 21-801(a), like subsections (b) through (h), addresses speed, not driving behaviors unrelated to speed.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">Finally, we are not persuaded by the State\u2019s argument that the darkness that attends nightfall is a condition contemplated by \u00a7 21-801(a). In outlining specific conditions that may require a person to drive at less than the posted speed limit in subsections (c) through (h), the General Assembly anticipated specific conditions that may require a slower rate of speed. Certain of these conditions may occur with great frequency; - others, with less frequency. None of these conditions, however, is as certain to occur as nightfall. Considering that the Legislature envisioned and included in \u00a7 21-801 less common potential dangers on Maryland roadways, we conclude that the omission of darkness was deliberate.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">Moreover, if the State were correct that darkness, without more, requires reduced speed on the roadways, then every driver who drives <em>at the speed Limit </em>at nighttime would be in violation- of \u00a7 21-801(a). We do not believe the General Assembly intended such a result. <em>See State v. Glass, </em>386 Md. 401, 410, 872 A.2d 729 (2005) (stating that reviewing courts should avoid constructions that lead to results that do not comport with common sense); Price, 378 Md. at 387, 835 A.2d 1221 (stating that reviewing courts should not \u201cconstrue the statute with forced or subtle interpretations that ... extend its application\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">In sum, we hold that \u00a7 21-801(a) requires drivers to reduce speed to a reasonable and prudent level to account for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>existing conditions \u2014 external to driving behavior itself \u2014 that create \u201cactual and potential dangers.\u201d Because the State failed to show that appellant\u2019s speed was unreasonable and imprudent in light of a condition that created an \u201cactual and potential\u201d danger, there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction for violating \u00a7 21-801(a). Accordingly, we reverse that conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">Appellant argues that the trial court abused its discretion in permitting the three police officers to testify that he was \u201cdrunk,\u201d \u201cunder the influence of alcohol,\u201d and \u201chighly impaired by alcohol.\u201d He maintains that this improperly admitted lay opinion testimony requires reversal of his DWI conviction. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">The decision to admit lay opinion testimony is vested within the sound discretion of the trial judge. <em>Bey v. State, </em>140 Md.App. 607, 623, 781 A.2d 952 (2001), <em>cert. denied, </em>368 Md. 526, 796 A.2d 695 (2002). The officers were not admitted as experts; therefore, Maryland Rule 5-701, addressing the admissibility of opinion testimony by lay witnesses, applies.</p>\n<p id=\"Axd\">Rule 5-701 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-7\">If the witness is not testifying as an expert, the witness\u2019s testimony in the form of opinions or inferences is limited to those opinions or inferences which are (1) rationally based on the perception of the witness and (2) helpful to a clear understanding of the witness\u2019s testimony or the determination of a fact in issue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-8\"><em>See also Ragland v. State, </em>385 Md. 706, 717, 870 A.2d 609 (2005) (stating that \u201c[l]ay opinion testimony is testimony that is rationally based on the perception of the witness\u201d); <em>Bruce v.

Pike, </em>49 N.H. 399 (1870), and stating: \u201c \u2018Intoxication is a fact open to the observation of any one, and requiring no skill or learning to discern it\u2019 \u201d); Joseph F. Murphy, Jr., Maryland Evidence Handbook \u00a7 603(C) (3d ed.1999) (explaining that a lay witness may opine, <em>inter alia, </em>that someone was under the influence of alcohol because \u201cthese are the kind of observations we make on a daily basis\u201d); Mclain, <em>supra, </em>701:le. at 707-08 (stating that \u201c[a] lay -witness with first-hand knowledge may testify,\u201d <em>inter alia, </em>that someone was \u201cdrunk or sober\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">The rule of admissibility of lay opinion testimony is no different when, as in this case, the lay opinion is offered by a police officer. <em>See, e.g., State v. Rich, </em>132 N.CApp. 440, 512 S.E.2d 441, 448 (1999) (holding that \u201cthe trial court was correct in allowing [a non-expert police officer] to offer his opinion\u201d that the defendant was \u201cappreciably impaired and unable to operate a vehicle\u201d), <em>aff'd, </em>351 N.C. 386, 527 S.E.2d 299, 306 (2000); <em>New v. State, </em>254 Ind. 307, 259 N.E.2d 696, 699 (1970) (holding that the trial court properly admitted testimony offered by a non-expert police officer that the defendant was intoxicated); <em>Mozley v. State, </em>163 Tex.Crim. 250, 290 S.W.2d 518, 520 (1956) (holding that the trial court did not err in permitting the officer who arrested the defendant to testify that the defendant was drunk, because \u201c[a] non-expert -witness may express his opinion as to intoxication when such opinion is based upon his observation of the appearance, acts and conduct of an accused\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">We hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in permitting the police officers to express their lay opinion that appellant was. \u201cdrunk,\u201d \u201cunder the influence of alcohol,\u201d and \u201chighly impaired by alcohol.\u201d Each officer\u2019s testimony was rationally based on his perception of appellant\u2019s condition. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>And each officer\u2019s testimony included not only his opinion concerning appellant\u2019s alcohol impairment, but also a description of his actual observations of appellant. <em>See </em>31A Am.Jur. 2D <em>Expert and Opinion Evidence </em>\u00a7 198 (2005) (noting that it is \u201cpreferable\u201d that a person offering a lay opinion preface that opinion with testimony about the individual\u2019s \u201cactions and conduct\u201d). The officers\u2019 opinion testimony, moreover, was relevant to the issues in this case, helpful to the jury, and not unfairly prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\"><em>Wilson v. State, </em>124 Md.App. 543, 723 A.2d 494 (1999), upon which appellant relies, does not compel a different conclusion. In <em>Wilson, </em>the State trooper who stopped the defendant testified as an expert witness in administering and. evaluating the results of a horizontal gaze nystagmus (\u201cHGN\u201d) test. <em>Id. </em>at 545-46, 723 A.2d 494. Over objection, the trooper was permitted to opine that, based on the results of the HGN test, the defendant was driving while intoxicated and that his blood alcohol content (\u201cBAC\u201d) was probably 0.10 or higher. <em>Id. </em>at 549, 723 A.2d 494. We held that the trooper should not have been permitted to offer testimony on the defendant\u2019s BAC. <em>Id. </em>at 553, 723 A.2d 494. We explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-6\">In our view, the court erred in permitting Trooper Redmond to testify that, based on the HGN test results, he believed appellant\u2019s blood alcohol content was \u201cprobably point one zero or higher.\u201d Although the trooper was qualified to administer the HGN test and, to that extent, was properly received as an expert, <em>HGN testing may not be used to establish a specific blood alcohol level. </em>Indeed, as the lengthy colloquy that we quoted earlier makes plain, the State never sought to establish that the trooper\u2019s expertise in administering the HGN test included the ability to determine specific blood alcohol content based on the HGN test results. The HGN test is a type of field sobriety test, but it is not the equivalent of laboratory chemical analysis of blood, breath, or urine.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-7\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\"><em>Wilson </em>is inapposite to the present case. The officers in this case did not offer an opinion \u2014 lay or expert \u2014 concerning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>appellant\u2019s BAC. Appellant nonetheless argues that, by testifying that he was \u201cdrunk,\u201d \u201cunder the influence,\u201d and \u201chighly impaired by alcohol,\u201d the police officers were attempting to quantify his BAC. We disagree with this argument, finding no support in the record for it.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">In sum, we are persuaded that the court did not abuse its discretion in permitting the State to elicit the police officers\u2019 lay opinion testimony that appellant was \u201chighly impaired by alcohol,\u201d \u201cunder the influence of alcohol,\u201d and \u201cdrunk.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">JUDGMENT OF CONVICTION FOR DRIVING IN EXCESS OF A REASONABLE AND PRUDENT SPEED REVERSED; JUDGMENT OF CONVICTION FOR DRIVING WHILE IMPAIRED BY ALCOHOL AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">COSTS TO BE DIVIDED EQUALLY BETWEEN APPELLANT AND MONTGOMERY COUNTY.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b178-11\">.
