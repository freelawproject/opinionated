He raises two questions, which we have consolidated as follows:<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Whether the circuit court erred in dismissing Dozier\u2019s petition for judicial review?</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">Dozier was employed by the Baltimore City Department of Social Services (\u201cBCDSS\u201d) from August 6, 1986, until March 5, 2004.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> During his eighteen years of service, Dozier was never the subject of any disciplinary action. He rose from a \u201cfront line social worker\u201d to a Program Administrator II.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As a Program Administrator II, Dozier was an \u201cemployee at will,\u201d serving \u201cat the pleasure of the employee\u2019s appointing authori<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>ty,\u201d and subject to termination \u201cfor any reason, solely in the discretion of the appointing authority.\u201d Maryland Code (1993, 2004 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 11-305 of the State Personnel and Pensions Article (\u201cSPP\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">On February 20, 2004, Dozier was presented with a notice of termination from the Department of Human Resources Secretary, Christopher J. McCabe. The letter, dated February 19, 2004, with an effective termination date of March 5, 2004, provided no justification for the termination and explained Dozier\u2019s right to appeal as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-6\">In accordance with \u00a7 11-113 of the State Personnel and Pensions Article, you may appeal the termination by filing a written appeal within 15 days of your receipt of this memorandum. Your appeal should be sent to the Employer-Employee Relations Unit, Department of Human Resources, 311 West Saratoga Street, Baltimore, Maryland 21201, and may only be based on the grounds that the action was illegal or unconstitutional. The decision on your appeal is the final decision in this matter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">Dozier filed a written appeal on March 1, 2004. Three days later, his counsel filed an addendum to the appeal providing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>four reasons why his termination was unlawful: (1) it was procedurally defective because it was not signed by his immediate appointing authority; (2) he would not have accepted a promotion 3 months earlier, which subjected him to reclassification and removed him from the \u201cprotections of the merit system,\u201d had he known he would be terminated; (3) counsel was conducting an investigation to determine if there was a violation of Dozier\u2019s civil rights; and (4) several days after the termination, the BCDSS Interim Director made a certain statement that Dozier interpreted to be defamatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">On March 24, 2004, the Employer-Employee Relations Unit (\u201cUnit\u201d) held a discretionary conference with Dozier pursuant to SPP \u00a7 11-113.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thereafter, on April 6, 2004, the Unit issued a written decision concluding that: (1) Dozier had not sustained his burden of proving that the Secretary of Human Resources did not have authority to terminate appointments within BCDSS; (2) Dozier\u2019s promotion in November 2003, had \u201cno bearing [] on the legality or constitutionality of [his] termination\u201d; and (3) Dozier had failed to prove that any defamatory statements were actually made, and that, in any event, any statements made after the termination did not demonstrate that the termination was illegal or unconstitutional. The decision by the Unit, pursuant to SPP \u00a7 11-113(d)(3), was the \u201cfinal administrative decision.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">Dozier filed a petition for judicial review on May 6, 2004, which was dismissed by the circuit court on September 2, 2004. After the court denied Dozier\u2019s Motion to Alter Judgment, he filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">Dozier contends that the circuit court improperly dismissed his petition for judicial review because it was authorized by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>statute and because he was denied due process. We shall address each contention individually.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">\n<em>I. Statutory Right to Judicial Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">The Maryland Rules provide that judicial review of \u201can order or action of an administrative agency\u201d is permitted only when \u201cauthorized by statute.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Md. Rule 7-201. In this case, Dozier, an employee at will, was terminated pursuant to SPP \u00a7 11-305, which grants a right of appeal pursuant \u00a7 11-113. It provides:<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-7\">(a) <em>Applicability of section. </em>\u2014 This section only applies to an employee:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-8\">(1) in the management service;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-9\">(2) in executive service; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-10\">(3) under a special appointment described in \u00a7 6-405 of this article.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>(b) <em>Procedure. </em>\u2014 (1) An employee or an employee\u2019s representative may file a written appeal of a disciplinary action with the head of the principal unit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-5\">(2) An appeal:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-6\">(i) must be filed within 15 days after the employee receives notice of the disciplinary action; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-7\">(ii) may only be based on the grounds that the disciplinary action is illegal or unconstitutional.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-8\">(3) The employee has the burden of proof in an appeal under this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-9\">(c) <em>Conference. </em>\u2014 The head of the principal unit may confer with the employee before making a decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-10\">(d) <em>Disposition. </em>\u2014 (1) The head of the principal unit may:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-11\">(1) uphold the disciplinary action; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-12\">(ii) rescind or modify the disciplinary action and restore to the employee any lost time, compensation, status, or benefits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-13\">(2) Within 15 days after receiving an appeal, the head of the principal unit shall issue the employee a written decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-14\">(3) The decision of the head of the principal is the final administrative decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-15\">(e) <em>Expungement of personnel records. </em>\u2014 Within 15 days after issuance of a decision to rescind a disciplinary action, the disciplinary action shall be expunged from the employee\u2019s personnel records.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-16\">The permitted appeal can \u201conly be based on grounds that the [termination] is illegal or unconstitutional.\u201d SPP \u00a7 11\u2014 113(b). On review, the head of the principal unit may \u201cuphold the [termination],\u201d or \u201crescind or modify\u201d it as he sees fit. SPP \u00a7 ll-113(d). But, as Dozier concedes, that decision is \u201cthe final administrative decision\u201d and there is no express provision for judicial review contained in SPP \u00a7 ll-113(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-17\">Dozier contends, however, that the Administrative Procedure Act (\u201cAPA\u201d) provides him with a statutory right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>judicial review.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Relying on Maryland Code (1984, 2004 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 10-222 of the State Government Article (\u201cSG\u201d), which authorizes judicial review to \u201ca party who is aggrieved by the final decision in a contested case,\u201d he argues that the appropriateness of his termination constituted a \u201ccontested case\u201d within the meaning of the APA and the upholding of his termination was the \u201cfinal decision\u201d in the case.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-4\">SG \u00a7 10-202(d) defines a \u201ccontested case\u201d as:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-5\">(d) <em>Contested case. </em>\u2014 (1) \u201cContested case\u201d means a proceeding before an agency to determine:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-6\">(i) a right, duty, statutory entitlement, or privilege of a person that is required by statute or constitution to be determined only after an opportunity for an agency hearing; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-7\">(ii) the grant, denial, renewal, revocation, suspension, or amendment of a license that is required by statute or constitution to be determined only after an opportunity for an agency hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-8\">(2) \u201cContested case\u201d does not include a proceeding before an agency involving an agency hearing required only by regulation unless the regulation expressly, or by clear implication, requires the hearing to be held in accordance with this subtitle.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b555-9\">In <em>Maryland Pharmacists Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. Office of the Attorney General, </em>115 Md.App. 650, 656-57, 694 A.2d 492 (1997) (citations omitted), this Court indicated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A8v\">the definition of \u201ccontested case\u201d was further refined to include only those disputes that, by their nature, entitle a party to an agency hearing, regardless of whether a hearing was in fact held. The entitlement to an agency hearing does not arise from the Administrative Procedure Act, but must originate from another source such as a statute, regulation, or due process principles. Thus, in order to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>decide that a \u201ccontested case\u201d existed, we must discern from some other source that the local Association would have ultimately been entitled to an agency hearing on the facts of this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">The Court concluded that \u201ca \u2018contested case\u2019 is a proceeding before, or dispute with, an agency that entitles a party to an <em>agency </em>hearing. The definition of \u2018contested case\u2019 contemplates only an agency hearing. In every instance, S.G. \u00a7 10-202(d) limits the scope of contested cases to those proceedings entitling a party to an agency hearing....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 658, 694 A.2d 492.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">At oral argument, Dozier contended that his right to appeal his termination was, in effect, an entitlement to an agency hearing within the meaning of the APA.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Relying on <em>Modular Closet Systems, Inc. v. Comptroller of the Treasury, </em>315 Md. 438, 444, 554 A.2d 1221 (1989), he argues that no \u201cformal agency hearing\u201d must be held for a case to constitute a \u201ccontested case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">In that case, Modular contested the imposition of assessments that had been levied against it by the 'Comptroller and requested a formal hearing to review the charges. Before an agency hearing could be held on the matter, however, the Comptroller abated the assessment. Modular moved for litigation expenses, arguing that the assessment was imposed without \u201csubstantial justification.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 443, 554 A.2d 1221. The Comptroller denied the request, and Modular petitioned for judicial review. The Comptroller responded that judicial review was not appropriate because the dispute had not risen to the level of a \u201ccontested case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">The Court of Appeals disagreed and concluded that a \u201cformal hearing\u201d need not to have been conducted for there to be a \u201ccontested case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 445, 554 A.2d 1221. It indicated that \u201ca dispute resolved prior to a formal hearing may, nonetheless, be a contested case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court explained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>that a dispute is considered a contested case when a statute or regulation \u201centitles\u201d the party to a hearing. <em>Id. </em>at 444, 554 A.2d 1221. Whether the hearing was actually conducted is irrelevant. <em>See also Donocam Associates v. Washington Suburban Sanitary Comm\u2019n, </em>302 Md. 501, 513, 489 A.2d 26 (1985) (indicating that the aggrieved party must have had a right to an agency hearing for there to be a \u201ccontested case\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\">In <em>Sugarloaf v. Waste Disposal, </em>323 Md. 641, 651, 594 A.2d 1115 (1991), the Court indicated that for a proceeding to meet the definition of \u201ccontested case\u201d certain \u201ctrial type\u201d procedures must be afforded to the complaining party in a hearing. <em>See also North v. Kent Island Ltd. P\u2019ship, </em>106 Md.App. 92, 103, 664 A.2d 34 (1995) (stating that \u201ctrial type\u201d procedures must be provided in a \u201ccontested hearing\u201d). In <em>C.S. v. Prince George\u2019s County Department of Social Services, </em>343 Md. 14, 32, 680 A.2d 470 (1996), the Court indicated that \u201c[o]ne of the key elements of a contested case hearing is whether the entity conducting the hearing acts in an adjudicatory capacity, <em>i.e. </em>by determining the facts of the case and applying those facts to some legal standard in order to reach a conclusion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">In fact, SG \u00a7 10-208 provides that the following rights are to be afforded in a contested hearing and should be outlined in the Notice of Hearing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-6\">(a) <em>In general.- </em>\u2014 An agency or the Office shall give all parties in a contested case reasonable written notice of the hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-7\">(b) <em>Contents of notice. </em>\u2014 The notice shall state:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-8\">(1) the date, time, place, and nature of the hearing;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-9\">(2) the right to call witnesses and submit documents or other evidence under \u00a7 10-213(f) of this subtitle;<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>(3) any applicable right to request, subpoenas for witnesses and evidence and specify the costs, if any, associated with such a request;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-4\">(4) that a copy of the hearing procedure is available on request and specify the costs associated with such a request;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-5\">(5) any right or restriction pertaining to representation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-6\">(6) that failure to appear for the scheduled hearing may result in an adverse action against the party; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-7\">(7) that, unless otherwise prohibited by law, the parties may agree to the evidence and waive their right to appear at the hearing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">SPP \u00a7\u00a7 11-113 and 11-305 provided Dozier with the right to appeal to \u201cthe head of the principal unit.\u201d SPP \u00a7 11\u2014 113(b). In considering his appeal, the head of the principal unit had discretion to confer with Dozier before making a decision. <em>See </em>SPP \u00a7 ll-113(c). There was such a conference, but certainly no \u201ctrial type\u201d proceedings. Nothing suggests that the Secretary or the Unit was acting in an \u201cadjudicatory capacity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b558-9\">Dozier argues that this Court has \u201cimplicitly acknowledged\u201d that employees at will who are terminated have a right to judicial review. In <em>Danaher v. Department of Labor, Licensing, and Regulation, </em>148 Md.App. 139, 161, 811 A.2d 359 (2002), we concluded that an employee at will terminated for alleged misconduct is entitled to the procedures outlined in SPP \u00a7 11-106 and to judicial review as outlined in SG \u00a7 10-222.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We did not, however, decide whether an employee at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>will who is not terminated for misconduct is entitled to judicial review. Indeed, the issue was not raised in <em>Danaher.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">The General Assembly has made it quite clear when it intends to afford State employees a \u201ccontested case\u201d hearing. For example, SPP \u00a7 11-110 provides a skilled service employee with the right to appeal the decision of the \u201chead of the principal unit\u201d to the Secretary. Upon receiving the appeal, the Secretary shall \u201cmediate a settlement\u201d or \u201crefer the appeal to the Office of Administrative Hearings\u201d to conduct a hearing. SPP \u00a7 11-110(b). No such right is provided to at will employees. SPP \u00a7 11 \u2014 113(b). Accordingly, we hold that SPP \u00a7\u00a7 11-113 and 11-305 did not entitle Dozier to a hearing and that his appeal was not a \u201ccontested case\u201d within the meaning of the APA. Therefore, Dozier was not entitled to judicial review under the APA.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">\n<em>II. Due Process</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">Dozier also contends that the circuit court\u2019s dismissal of his petition for judicial review constituted a denial of his due process rights. He advances two reasons for why we should determine that his constitutional rights to due process were denied: (1) he \u201chad property and liberty interests in his State employment, which were protected by the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution and Article 24 of the Declaration of Rights\u201d and (2) his liberty interests were violated when he was summarily dismissed without an opportunity to respond.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">DHR asserts that because these arguments were not raised before the circuit court, they are not properly before us. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>Indeed, pursuant to Maryland Rule 8-131, we \u201cwill not decide any other issue unless it plainly appears by the record to have been raised in or decided by the trial court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">Were we to address Dozier\u2019s constitutional claims, we would conclude that they are without merit. An entitlement to due process protections is based on a deprivation of a liberty or property interest protected by the Fourteenth Amendment by State action. <em>Board of Regents v. Roth, </em>408 U.S. 564, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 33 L.Ed.2d 548 (1972); <em>City of Annapolis v. Rowe, </em>123 Md.App. 267, 275-76, 717 A.2d 976 (1998). Dozier, as an employee at will, was subject to termination \u201cfor any reason, solely in the discretion of the appointing authority.\u201d SPP \u00a7 11-305. He did not have a property interest in continued employment. <em>See Elliott v. Kupferman, </em>58 Md.App. 510, 520, 473 A.2d 960 (citations omitted) (stating, \u201cAs a general rule, a non-tenured State or local government employee who serves \u2018at will\u2019 is <em>not </em>regarded as having a property right in continued public employment.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">Nor can Dozier prove that his termination violated a constitutionally protected liberty interest in his reputation. In <em>Board of Regents v. Roth, </em>the Supreme Court indicated that a public employee\u2019s protected liberty interest may be implicated if the employee was terminated for alleged dishonesty. The Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-7\">The State, in declining to rehire the respondent, did not make any charge against him that might seriously damage his standing and associations in his community. It did not base the nonrenewal of his contract on a charge, for example, that he had been guilty of dishonesty or immorality. Had it done so, this would be a different case. For \u2018(w)here a person\u2019s good name, reputation, honor, or integrity is at stake because of what the government is doing to him, notice and an opportunity to be heard are essential.\u2019 In such a case, due process would accord an opportunity to refute the charge before University officials. In the present case, however, there is no suggestion whatever that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>respondent\u2019s \u2018good name, reputation, honor, or integrity\u2019 is at stake.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">Roth, 408 U.S. at 573, 92 S.Ct. 2701 (footnote omitted) (citations omitted). That case also made clear that the decision not to \u201crenew [a] contract,\u201d or, as in this case, to discharge an employee at will, does not raise such constitutional questions. <em>Id. </em>at 578, 92 S.Ct. 2701.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">At the discretionary conference, Dozier presented a written statement that, \u201cat the meeting of February 23, 2004, \u2018a statement was made to the general population that the atmosphere of \u201cbondage\u201d could not continue.\u2019 \u201d Dozier alleges that the statement was \u201cdefamatory and placed [him] in a false light.\u201d The alleged defamatory statement was made by Floyd Blair, the Interim Director of BCDSS, several days after Dozier\u2019s termination. According to Dozier, Blair said that the \u201cadministration had listened to the staff and had freed them from bondage.\u201d At most, the statement might discredit Dozier\u2019s people skills and management style, but it does not rise to the level of misconduct impugning his honesty or morals that \u201cmight seriously damage his standing and associations in his community.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 573, 92 S.Ct. 2701. Moreover, it was made after his termination for which there was no stated cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b550-8\">. Dozier poses the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b550-9\">1. Whether the trial court erred by dismissing appellant\u2019s petition when he had a statutory right to judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-10\">2. Whether the appellant was denied due process when the court dismissed his petition for judicial review.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b550-11\">.
