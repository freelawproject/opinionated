After an \u201cAdministrative Hearing Board\u201d (the \u201cBoard\u201d) found appellee not guilty of engaging in an unauthorized vehicular pursuit, the Commission filed a \u201cPetition for Appeal\u201d with the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County. Concluding that the Commission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>was not entitled to judicial review, the circuit court granted Anderson\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\">On appeal, the Commission presents two issues, which we quote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-5\">I. Whether the Circuit Court erred as a matter of law in granting appellee\u2019s Motion to Dismiss and, in so doing, finding that appellant Commission is not entitled to judicial review of the final decision of an administrative hearing board pursuant to [\u00a7 ] 3-109 of the LEOBR.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-6\">II. Whether the Circuit Court erred as a matter of law in granting appellee\u2019s Motion to Dismiss and, in so doing, finding that appellant Commission is not entitled to judicial review of the final decision of an administrative hearing board pursuant to [\u00a7 ] 10-222 of the Administrative Procedures Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">For the reasons that follow, we shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b567-9\">The Commission is a body corporate and an agency of the State. <em>See </em>Md.Code Ann. (1957, 2003 Repl.Vol.), Art. 28, \u00a7 1-101. Recently, in <em>Boyle v. Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Comm\u2019n, </em>385 Md. 142, 146, 867 A.2d 1050 (2005), the Court of Appeals outlined the rights and responsibilities of the Commission:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-10\">The Commission is a bi-county agency created by the General Assembly to develop both general and functional plans of proposed land development for the Washington Metropolitan District, which consists of most of Montgomery and Prince George\u2019s Counties. <em>See </em>Maryland Code, Art. 28, \u00a7 7-108. That is the main \u201cplanning\u201d function. In carrying out the general plan, the Commission is authorized to acquire property within the District for roads, parks, forests, and other recreation facilities, and to improve and control such property for those purposes. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 5-101. That is the main \u201cpark\u201d function.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b568-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>Pursuant to Art. 28, \u00a7 5-114(a), the Commission \u201cmay appoint whatever park police officers as may be necessary to provide protection for the Commission\u2019s activities and property.\u201d These officers \u201care responsible to and are under the supervision of the Commission.\u201d <em>Boyle, </em>385 Md. at 146, 867 A.2d 1050. The park police also \u201chave concurrent general police jurisdiction with the Montgomery and Prince George\u2019s County police within the parks and other areas ... under the jurisdiction of the Commission....\u201d Art. 28, \u00a7 5-114(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">Regarding park police officers, the <em>Boyle </em>Court explained, 385 Md. at 146-47, 867 A.2d 1050 (emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-6\">[S]ome functions of the Commission are handled by the central Commission staff while others are implemented by geographically-based Divisions of the Commission within each of the two counties. Among the functions handled centrally are human resources, finance, and general counsel, and included within the finance department is general procurement for the Commission. <em>Among the functions handled by Divisions within the respective counties is the police function. There is a separate Park Police Division, headed by a Chief and having its own command and administrative structure, in each of the two counties.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">Since 1998, appellee has served as a Park Police Officer. On September 8, 2001, she was assigned to the midnight shift for the Prince George\u2019s County Park Police Division (\u201cthe Division\u201d),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> operating a marked police cruiser equipped with an in-car computer and camera. At approximately 10:30 p.m. on that date, while appellee was on a two-lane residential road in Prince George\u2019s County (the \u201cCounty\u201d), she activated the emergency lights on her patrol car, intending to stop a vehicle bearing license plates that had been reported as stolen. When the vehicle did not stop, appellee activated the siren on her patrol car, and remained in contact with the Division\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>\u201ccommunications\u201d by means of her police radio. At that point, the suspect vehicle exceeded the posted speed limit, crossed the center line, and may have struck another vehicle. As the vehicle was moving, the occupants jumped out. Their vehicle continued to move, without a driver, and struck a telephone pole.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">The Commission\u2019s policy as to vehicular pursuits is codified in Bi-County Directive 414 (\u201cBCD 414\u201d), effective January 1, 1979, as amended on May 9, 2001. In accordance with the 2001 Amendment, \u201cfresh pursuit\u201d is permitted only</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AMT\">when an officer has probable cause to believe that the fleeing suspect has committed or is attempting to commit the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-5\">\u2022 Any felony involving the use of force or threat of physical force or violence against a person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-6\">\u2022 A hit and run traffic accident resulting in death or serious injury!.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">Notably, \u201c[a]ny other pursuits are prohibited.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">By \u201cMemorandum\u201d dated October 4, 2002, appellee was notified that she was charged as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-9\">Charge # 1. Failure to comply with Bi-County Rule 2: Conformance to Law \u2014 Officers and employees of these divisions shall obey all laws of the United States, the State of Maryland, County ordinances!,] all rules and directives of these divisions, and the Commission where applicable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b569-10\">To wit: On September 8, 2001, you engaged in a vehicle pursuit in direct violation of the amendment (dated 5/9/01) to Bi-County Directive 414.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-11\">Charge # 2. Bi-County Directive 414: Fresh Pursuit, Amendment (dated 5/9/01) \u2014 Fresh Pursuit is only allowed when an officer has probable cause to believe that the fleeing suspect has committed or is attempting to commit the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-12\">Any felony involving the use of force or threat of physical force or violence against a person. A hit-and-run traffic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>accident resulting in death or serious injury. Any other pursuits are prohibited.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-4\">To wit: On September 8, 2001, you engaged in a vehicle pursuit in direct violation of the Amendment (dated 5/9/01) to Bi-County Directive 414.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-5\">Charge # 3. Bi-County Rule 9: Integrity of Reporting System (A). No officer or employee shall make or cause to be made, any omission, false, inaccurate, or improper entries in any official record, form or report, nor shall they under any circumstances make any false official statement or intentional misrepresentation of fact.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aq0\">To wit: On September 8, 2001, you engaged in a vehicle pursuit and then provided a false statement to Sgt. Uhrig when he questioned you.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">In light of the charges, the Division informed Anderson that it \u201cintend[ed] to take the disciplinary measure of termination of employment----\u201d Accordingly, appellee exercised her right to an administrative hearing, pursuant to P.S. \u00a7 3-107(a), which was held on March 13 and 14, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-9\">Captain Robert Ashton testified that he proposed the 2001 amendment to BCD 414 so it would conform to the more restrictive vehicular pursuit policy adopted by the County. He explained that he wanted to avoid \u201cextreme liability\u201d for the agency.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b570-10\">On October 10, 2001, Ashton spoke with Diane RobertsonGriggs, who claimed she was the driver of a sport utility vehicle struck by the suspect vehicle on September 8, 2001. Following that conversation, Captain Ashton asked Sergeant Daren Uhrig to \u201cretrieve the in-car videotape from Officer Anderson.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He also \u201cspoke with Officer Christopher Perry <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>regarding what he saw on the scene when he went to back up Officer Anderson.\u201d Then, he \u201cspoke with Lieutenant [Tom] Kane and made a verbal request for the radio transmission tapes regarding the incident.\u201d On October 17, 2001, after having reviewed the requested items, Ashton \u201cwrote a complaint against police practice for this matter to be investigated further.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">On cross-examination, Captain Ashton conceded that the mere activation of emergency equipment \u201cdoesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re in pursuit[.]\u201d He also acknowledged that there are \u201coccasions when you follow a vehicle and it\u2019s not a pursuitf.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">Sergeant Uhrig was appellee\u2019s supervisor on the night of September 8, 2001. He recalled that, at approximately 10:30 p.m. on September 8, 2001, he was \u201clistening to the [police] radio\u201d when he overheard that \u201cOfficer Anderson had called out with a license plate.\u201d Uhrig testified: \u201cI believe she asked for [a] registration check on [the] license plate. At some point the registration plate for the vehicle came back stolen.... I believe she said the vehicle wasn\u2019t stopping....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">According to Sergeant Uhrig, Lieutenant Tom Kane \u201cwanted to know what occurred,\u201d and if \u201cthere was a fast chase.\u201d Uhrig questioned appellee about whether there was a chase, but she \u201csaid there wasn\u2019t.\u201d Uhrig testified: \u201c[B]asically she described the incident. She had turned on the emergency equipment and the vehicle had failed to stop. And then that she had later come upon the vehicle wrecked din [sic] the telephone pole.\u201d After spealdng with Officer Anderson, Uhrig \u201cdidn\u2019t think a fast chase had occurred.\u201d He added: \u201cFrom the information I had I felt that she handled it properly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">On the night of September 8, 2001, Lieutenant Kane was the \u201c[operations duty officer for Prince George\u2019s County patrol....\u201d At approximately 10:30 p.m., while monitoring the radio, Kane received a radio transmission from appellee. He was \u201cconcerned enough that [he] made an inquiry whether a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>pursuit had occurred.\u201d He also \u201cinstructed Sergeant Uhrig to ensure that no chase had taken place, because if it had I would have to do a commander\u2019s log before leaving.\u201d Uhrig asked appellee to call with her \u201canswer [to] that question.\u201d Kane was in Sergeant Uhrig\u2019s office when appellee responded. Kane testified that, following the conversation, Sergeant Uhrig \u201ctold [him] that there had been no [chase] and there was no need for a performance report.\u201d Therefore, Kane took no \u201cfurther actions\u201d regarding the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">Sergeant Harvey Baker interviewed appellee on January 9, 2002.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Anderson claimed that, while following the suspect vehicle, she saw \u201cno cars ... on the road.... There was no traffic, no pedestrians.\u201d According to appellee, she was \u201cone or two\u201d car lengths behind the suspect vehicle when it struck the telephone pole; the entire incident lasted \u201cbetween seven and [ten] minutes\u201d; and it extended \u201cmaybe two and a half\u2019 miles. Officer Anderson denied that she ignored \u201cany traffic control devices in trying to get the vehicle to stop[.]\u201d Moreover, appellee estimated that her top speed was \u201cbetween 35 and 40 [m.p.h.],\u201d in contrast to the posted speed limit of \u201c25 to 30.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">Officer Anderson denied that her actions violated BCD 414. When asked by Sergeant Baker whether she pursued the vehicle, appellee responded: \u201cDid I try to get it to stop? Yes. Did I pursue it? I was behind it. \u2014 . It happened so quick.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">Appellee was the sole witness for the defense. She explained that, as a patrol officer, her duties included observing \u201cvehicles on or about park property.\u201d Anderson recalled that she began to follow the suspect vehicle after a registration check revealed that the license plates had been reported as stolen. She indicated that she intended to stop the suspect vehicle along the side of Dupont Heights park property. Appellee insisted that \u201cit wasn\u2019t\u201d her \u201cintent to initiate a pursuit,\u201d and she denied that a vehicular pursuit ensued. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>Indeed, Anderson claimed that, while following the vehicle, she decided not to pursue it because it had passed another vehicle, \u201cand went over the double yellow line\u201d into the lane designated for oncoming traffic. She also claimed that she informed communications of her decision. According to appellee, as she prepared to deactivate the emergency equipment, the suspects \u201cturned ... and then they bailed out while the car was still moving.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\">On cross-examination, appellee admitted that, while following the suspect vehicle, she crossed over the center line on the roadway, and into the lane for oncoming traffic, in order to pass a civilian motorist. Officer Anderson also admitted that, while following the suspect vehicle, she \u201cwas a little over the speed limit.\u201d Although appellee insisted that her speed \u201cwasn\u2019t excessive,\u201d she acknowledged that there were pedestrians \u201cin the road.\u201d Officer Anderson also testified that, on the day following the incident, she \u201creceived a telephone call about property damage,\u201d which she included in her report of the incident. She maintained, however, that, prior to that call, she was unaware of any property damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">At the close of the hearing, the Board rendered an oral ruling, in which it found appellee not guilty of all of the charges. Thereafter, on June 30, 2003, the Board issued its written \u201cDecision of Hearing Board Relative to PO Kathleen Anderson\u201d (the \u201cDecision\u201d), reciting its findings of fact and the basis for its ruling. Noting that it had \u201ccarefully scrutinized all of the testimony and the circumstances under which it was given,\u201d the Board made clear that its ruling was \u201cbased in part upon its view of the credibility of the witnesses.\u201d It also said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AUy\">The Board also considered, among other factors, the state of mind and demeanor of each witness while testifying, his or her opportunity to observe and accurately relate to the matters discussed, whether the testimony has been contradicted, any bias or prejudices of the witnesses, the manner in which the witness may be affected by a decision in the case, and the extent to which the testimony of the witness is supported or contradicted by other evidence. The Board also considered the documentary evidence presented to it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>and how that evidence interfaced with the testimony of the various witnesses. In that regard, the Board had copies of the interviews of Officer Anderson.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-4\">The Board also had available to it an audio tape and video tape of the alleged pursuit of September 8, 2001. The Board was able to hear and view for itself the circumstances and the events of September 8, 2001.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">With these considerations in mind, the Board reasoned that BCD 414 does \u201cnot set forth precise guidelines under which an officer may or may not follow a vehicle in an attempt to have said vehicle stop.\u201d In the Board\u2019s view, \u201cthe policies afford the officer some reasonable discretion with respect to making a determination that a vehicle will not stop and that, accordingly, there should not be any continued effort to stop the vehicle.\u201d Recognizing that its determination was \u201ca close call\u201d the Board nonetheless concluded that appellee had not violated BCD 414.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">In reaching that conclusion, the Board noted that \u201cthe audio tape clearly reinforces Officer Anderson\u2019s testimony that she had determined to break off any pursuit of the vehicle....\u201d It stated: \u201cThe fact that Officer Anderson continued in the direction of the suspect vehicle and approached after the vehicle was abandoned and wrecked did not transform her conduct into a violation of Bi-County Directive 414.\u201d Of import here, quoting P.S. \u00a7 3-108(a)(3), the Board stated: \u201c \u2018A finding of Not Guilty terminates the action.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">The Commission subsequently sought judicial review of the Board\u2019s Decision. Appellee responded with a motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-8\">In her motion, appellee contended that the Board, composed of three law enforcement members, all appointed by the chief, \u201cis a quasi-judicial body assembled by [the Commission] for the express purpose of hearing testimony and adjudicating the disciplinary charges against its own officer.\u201d Moreover, she claimed that the Commission \u201c \u2018is not a party to the proceeding before it or before an appellate body authorized to review its decision, and it has no judicially cognizable interest in what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>happens to that decision.\u2019 \u201d (Citation omitted). Anderson stated: \u201cAbsent some special statutory authorization, therefore, [the Board] does not have the right to appeal its own decision.\u201d She added that \u201cno provision in legislation establishing or regulating the [Commission] confers upon it the right to appeal its own decisions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\">In its opposition, the Commission indicated that it did not seek review of \u201cits own decision\u201d because the \u201cdecision at issue is <em>not </em>the Commission\u2019s decision; rather, it is the decision of an <em>ad hoc </em>administrative board mandated by the provisions of the LEOBR.\u201d According to appellant, if the Commission were not allowed to obtain judicial review, the result would be to allow the Board to \u201cnullify ... the police agency\u2019s vehicle pursuit regulations without affording the agency or the court an avenue by which to correct the clearly erroneous and unsubstantiated decision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">The Commission also addressed the statutory provision in P.S. \u00a7 3-108(a)(3), which states: \u201cA finding of \u2018not guilty terminates the action.\u2019 \u201d In its view, that provision simply expresses that the ruling \u201cconstitutes a final decision for purposes of appeal.\u201d In this regard, the agency pointed to the absence of \u201clanguage in the LEOBR limiting the right of appeal to the officer[.]\u201d Appellant added: \u201cThe rights of both parties to appeal final LEOBR administrative decisions in no way infringes upon the procedural rights of police officers.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>-<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">Moreover, the Commission contended that it \u201cwas a party to the administrative action, serving in a quasi-prosecutorial capacity.\u201d Therefore, it insisted that it was entitled to judicial review of the Board\u2019s Decision under the Administrative Procedure Act (\u201cAPA\u201d), codified in Md.Code (1984, 2004 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 10-222 of the State Government Article (\u201cS.G.\u201d).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b576-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>At the motion hearing held on February 19, 2004, the circuit court questioned appellant\u2019s counsel as to why the court should not dismiss the action pursuant to P.S. \u00a7 3 \u2014 108(a)(3). Referring to the absence of express language in LEOBR granting a right of appeal to the Commission, the court stated: \u201c[I]t doesn\u2019t say the law enforcement agency has a right to appeal, does it?\u201d The following exchange is relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-4\">[COUNSEL FOR APPELLANT]: ... <em>It is the Commission\u2019s position that [P.S. \u00a7 ] 3-108 read in conjunction with [P.S. \u00a7 ] 3-109, which also references judicial review, would conclude that the termination of the action is a final decision by the Trial Board and authorizes the agency to petition for judicial review.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-5\">THE COURT: <em>Why didn\u2019t the legislature then say that? </em>Say this is a final judgment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-6\">[COUNSEL FOR APPELLANT]: In Section 3-108, the legislature sets forth the decisions that can be made by a trial board and the appellate procedures that can be taken from those decisions....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-8\">The court also questioned the Commission\u2019s counsel about how to reconcile a right of judicial review for the Commission with P.S. \u00a7 3-110, which allows for expungement of a police officer\u2019s record in cases of acquittal, dismissal, or a finding of not guilty. The following colloquy is pertinent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-9\">THE COURT: Let me ask you this. If I agree with your argument and I then reverse the Trial Board, can the police officer have her record expunged three years from now?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-10\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-11\">[COUNSEL FOR APPELLANT]: I\u2019m not sure that the officer could. It would depend on what the punishment was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-12\">THE COURT: Suppose she\u2019s fired.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-4\">[COUNSEL FOR APPELLANT]: I don\u2019t believe she has the right to expunge the action from her personnel file, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-5\">THE COURT: Then what does this portion of the statute mean, [P.S. \u00a7 ] 3-110? \u201cOn written request, a law enforcement officer may have expunge[d] from any file the record of a formal complaint made against the law enforcement officer if a hearing board acquitted the law enforcement officer, dismissed the action or made a finding of not guilty.\u201d What does that mean?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-6\">[COUNSEL FOR APPELLANT]:.... If this decision was reversed and a finding of guilty was made, then she could not have it expunged. If simply there was \u2014 if the finding of not guilty held firm, she could have that expunged from her record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-7\">THE COURT: I\u2019ve reversed \u2014 I\u2019ve now reversed the Trial Board and I\u2019ve entered a finding of guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-8\">[COUNSEL FOR APPELLANT]: And I believe what an officer for the court [would have to do] would be to remand that to the Board.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-9\">THE COURT: Why doesn\u2019t [P.S. \u00a7 ] 110 say that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AaS\">[COUNSEL FOR APPELLANT]: Well, I think it doesn\u2019t have to because it simply goes to a finding of guilty or not guilty. If it was remanded to \u2014 before the Trial Board and the Trial Board came to the conclusion that was \u2014 that the proper decision should have been guilty, well then clearly she couldn\u2019t have it expunged. If the same decision was rendered [i.e., not guilty], then she could have it expunged. I don\u2019t think the legislature needed to get into the detail on that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b577-10\">Appellant\u2019s counsel acknowledged that the purpose of LEOBR \u201cis to protect the procedural rights of law enforcement officers with respect to disciplinary action from a law enforcement agency,\u201d but claimed the protections apply \u201cduring the investigatory stage and during the hearing stage[J\u201d On the subject of due process, the court asked: \u201c[I]f you\u2019re <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>allowed to appeal a finding of not guilty, which is precluded from the state in a criminal case, aren\u2019t you in effect violating some due process rights ... ?\u201d The court also asked: \u201c[0]ne of the due process elements is a double jeopardy argument, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Counsel for appellant responded: \u201c[TJhis is not a criminal ease. This is an administrative action.\u201d When the court observed that the title of the statute is \u201cthe Law Enforcement Officer\u2019s Bill of Rights,\u201d and not \u201cthe Law Enforcement Agency\u2019s Bill of Rights,\u201d appellant responded: \u201cI think the right of the agency for judicial review of an arbitrary [and] capricious decision does not negatively impact the loss of law enforcement officer\u2019s procedural rights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">At the close of the hearing, the court granted Anderson\u2019s motion to dismiss. The court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-5\">[T]he titling of this statute is the Law Enforcement Officer\u2019s Bill of Rights. It is not the Law Enforcement Agency\u2019s Bill of Rights.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-6\">...

I think the intent of the legislature has previously been identified by our appellate courts in identifying the purpose, being to set procedural safeguards and to guarantee due process rights to the law enforcement officer....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-8\">In attempting to harmonize the entire statute, I look at [P.S. \u00a7 ] 3-110(2)(ii)[,] which deals with the expungement of the record of a formal complaint. And it states that, \u201cOn written request a law enforcement officer may have expunged from any file the record of a formal complaint made against the law enforcement officer if a hearing board acquitted the law enforcement officer, dismissed the action or made a finding of not guilty.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-9\">That would indicate to me the finding of not guilty terminates the action and is not a final judgment that makes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>the action of the Trial Board ripe for appeal by the law enforcement agency.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-4\">To find otherwise would make that language inconsistent if I were to accept the appeal and then reverse the finding of the Trial Board.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-5\">...

It states, in part: \u201cThe rules in this Chapter govern actions for judicial review of (1) an order or action of an administrative agency, <em>where judicial review is authorized by statute....\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). Further, Md. Rule 7-202 states: \u201cA person seeking judicial review under this chapter shall file a petition for judicial review in a circuit court authorized to provide the review.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b585-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>B.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-4\">The Commission contends that the circuit court erred in ruling that, whether under LEOBR or the APA, the Commission \u201cis not entitled to judicial review of the final decision of an administrative hearing board.\u201d Therefore, the agency \u201cseeks [judicial] review of the palpably erroneous decision of the three-member board of lay subordinate park police officers who effectively nullified one of the most important of the Commission\u2019s public safety regulations.\u201d According to the Commission, \u201cabsent language in the LEOBR limiting the right of appeal solely to a law enforcement <em>officer, </em>the LEOBR should be read to permit the Commission\u2019s appeal of the Board\u2019s decision.\u201d Appellant adds: \u201cHad the Legislature intended to permit a law enforcement <em>officer\u2019s </em>right to appeal and prohibit a law enforcement <em>agency\u2019s </em>right to appeal, that restriction would be expressed in the text of [P.S.] Section 3-109(a).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">Moreover, the Commission argues: \u201c[T]he LEOBR does not evidence any affirmative decision or intention by the General Assembly to guarantee, vest or entitle an officer to the favorable decision of a hearing board if that decision was reached unlawfully.\u201d Appellant adds: \u201cAlthough the LEOBR certainly imbues officers with certain procedural rights, there is no language or intent embodied in the statute to shelter such palpable errors of law from all judicial scrutiny.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">According to the Commission, the denial of the right of judicial review would shelter a flagrantly erroneous decision of the Board, and deprive a law enforcement agency of its \u201cinterest in receiving just and fair consideration during administrative hearings concerning intended employment actions .... \u201d The agency adds: \u201cPrecluding the Commission from appealing the Board\u2019s decision ... would allow the lay <em>ad hoc </em>Board to rewrite or nullify the Department\u2019s vehicle pursuit regulations without affording the agency, or the court, a means by which to correct such an erroneous legal decision.\u201d It \u201ccan think of no reason why such autonomy, the likes of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>which is not even entrusted to the judiciary, would be delegated to such an entity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">Appellant also maintains that, under P.S \u00a7 3-107, the \u201c \u2018LEOBR hearings approximate a full-blown trial in circuit court,\u2019 \u201d (citation omitted), in which \u201cthe charging agency and officer charged are properly viewed as party opponents,\u201d with the attendant rights to counsel, to present evidence, and to cross-examine witnesses. Because \u201cthe hearing board process prescribed under the LEOBR ... is appropriately considered as an adversarial one,\u201d argues appellant, \u201ca decision by the board is not reasonably attributed to the Commission or the chief.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">Further, appellant points out that, because P.S. \u00a7 3-108(a) \u201crequires that all board decisions be \u2018in writing and accompanied by findings of fact,\u2019 it should follow that \u2018not guilty\u2019 decisions reduced to writing in such a manner are as appeal-able as \u2018guilty\u2019 decisions.\u201d Otherwise, asks appellant rhetorically, \u201cwhat would be the purpose of findings of fact if there existed no opportunity for judicial review?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">The agency also challenges appellee\u2019s contention that it has improperly sought judicial review of \u201cits own\u201d decision. According to the Commission, the trial board \u201cessentially is an impartial tribunal vested with specified statutory authority that is independent of the authority of the chief and the agency.\u201d Appellant insists that Board members \u201cmaintained no authoritative role within the Commission\u2019s structure,\u201d and their \u201cdecisions had no binding effect on the Commission.\u201d In addition, appellant points out that, \u201cbecause the statute contemplates that the chief may appoint hearing board members who do not belong to his or her agency, it is entirely conceivable that the hearing board may be convened without a single member drawn from the agency that has charged the officer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">Moreover, the Commission maintains that \u201cthe language of [P.S.] Section 3-109 in no way expresses an intent to abrogate the right of the agency to judicial review....\u201d While appellant acknowledges that the \u201cunfortunate sentence construction [in P.S. \u00a7 3-109(a) ] raises a literal question about whom the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>General Assembly intended to authorize to take such an appeal \u2014 the law enforcement officer, the law enforcement agency, or both,\u201d it insists that \u201cthe provision is equally silent concerning the officer\u2019s right to judicial review.\u201d Therefore, the agency relies on P.S. \u00a7 3 \u2014 109(b), noting that LEOBR specifically authorizes the agency to seek an appeal to this Court from an adverse decision rendered by the circuit court. In appellant\u2019s view, \u201cnothing within reach of the statute\u2019s plain meaning nor embodied in its ultimate purpose, would support an inference that the General Assembly intended\u201d only to give the Commission a right to appeal to this Court, but not to the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\">Although appellant recognizes that LEOBR \u201cwas enacted to ensure that police officers are afforded procedural safeguards during employment-related disciplinary\u2019 actions,\u201d it maintains that \u201cextending the statutory right of appeal\u201d to the police agency does not vitiate the law enforcement officers\u2019 procedural rights under LEBOR. The agency asserts: \u201cThe fact that an agency might seek appeal of an unfavorable hearing board decision does not in any way \u2018divest\u2019 the law enforcement officer of the procedures followed properly which lead up to that appeal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">In the Commission\u2019s view, \u201c[j]udicial review of a LEOBR decision can be harmonized with [P.S.] Section 3-110 of the LEOBR,\u201d which grants the officer the right to expungement upon an acquittal. In this regard, the agency maintains that the circuit court\u2019s reasoning was \u201cflawed,\u201d because judicial review of an administrative decision \u201ccarries with it the possibility that the administrative decision will be reversed.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">Alternatively, appellant contends that it has a right of judicial review under S.G. \u00a7 10-222. The Commission notes: \u201cSection 10-222 of the APA provides an agency the right to appeal administrative decisions if that agency is a party to the administrative proceeding and is aggrieved by the resulting administrative decision.\u201d Citing <em>Coleman v. Anne Arundel County Police Dep\u2019t, </em>369 Md. 108, 136, 797 A.2d 770 (2002), and <em>Tippery v.

She avers: \u201c[T]he LEOBR makes no reference to a department\u2019s appeal of its own decision, and in the context of the statutory scheme of the LEOBR there is no evidence of a legislative intent to even implicitly allow such an appeal, let alone to explicitly authorize it.\u201d In contrast, argues Anderson, the statute specifically confers on the officer the right to appeal a finding of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">Appellee asserts: \u201cThe LEOBR clearly does not assume nor mandate reciprocity of rights between the agency and the officer.\u201d She explains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-7\">By <em>including </em>precise, statutory requirements for determining finality of guilty decisions to generate the right to judicial review, the General Assembly signals a clear intent to <em>exclude </em>finality for not guilty decisions. The General Assembly was fully capable of drafting the statute in a way to include elaboration as to the meaning of finality of not guilty decisions for appeal purposes if it so intended, but there is no indication of such an intent. The legislature would have framed an equally specific designation or a general statement concerning judicial review of not guilty decisions if it had intended to grant such a right to the agency.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b588-8\">Appellee also agrees with the circuit court that the General Assembly\u2019s intent in enacting the LEOBR \u201cwas to provide procedural rights to law enforcement officers, not administrative agencies.\u201d In her view, to grant the Commission a right to judicial review \u201cwould run counter to the purpose of the LEOBR and its intended effect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b589-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>Officer Anderson also contends that the Commission is not sufficiently aggrieved \u201cto hold appellate rights pursuant to Section 3-109 of the LEOBR.\u201d She reasons that, \u201cwhile the Commission may have an interest in enforcing its policies with its employees, the Commission is no more affected by the not guilty decision and alleged failure to enforce the policy against vehicular pursuit than the public generally.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b589-4\">Moreover, appellee argues that the Commission does not have a right to judicial review of a \u201cnot guilty decision\u201d under the APA. She contends that the APA does not apply here, because it \u201cconflicts with the LEOBR to the extent that it purports to entitle an agency to judicial review of the final decision \u2014 a right purposefully excluded from the LEOBR by the General Assembly!.]\u201d In this regard, appellee reminds us that LEOBR specifically provides that, in the event of a conflict with another statute, the LEOBR \u201csupersedes\u201d that statute. Anderson also observes that the Maryland appellate courts have not applied the APA to create a right of judicial review for the agency under the LEOBR.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">In addition, Anderson maintains that the Commission \u201cis not a party aggrieved pursuant to the APA.\u201d She explains: \u201cThe Courts have interpreted [S.G. \u00a7 ] 10-222(a)(3) to define \u2018aggrieved\u2019 for purposes of the APA by two requirements: a substantial right of the petitioner has been violated and the petitioner may have been prejudiced by a departure from prescribed procedure.\u201d According to appellee, the Commission failed to satisfy either prong. As to the second prong of the APA\u2019s aggrievement test, Anderson maintains: \u201cThe Commission makes no allegation that procedure was circumvented or guidelines were not followed at Officer Anderson\u2019s trial board.... Merely because the Board did not reach a guilty finding does not warrant a conclusion that procedures were violated!.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">Appellee also takes issue with the Commission\u2019s assertion that the Board\u2019s decision \u201ceffectively rewrote and nullified the Department\u2019s vehicle pursuit policy.\u201d She contends: \u201cPolicies were not rewritten. Officer Anderson was found not guilty. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>Officers are routinely acquitted at LEOBR Board hearings. Not-guilty decisions do not change policies....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">\u201c[T]he scope of judicial review in a LEOBR case \u2018is that generally applicable to administrative appeals.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ocean City Police Dep\u2019t v.

But, those principles are inapplicable here, because the circuit court dismissed the appeal without reviewing the merits of the agency\u2019s ruling. Instead, the court determined that the Commission did not have the right to appeal the Board\u2019s decision, either under LEOBR or the APA.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">In considering whether appellant has a right to appeal under the LEOBR, we are presented with a question of statutory interpretation, which we review <em>de novo. See Salamon v. Progressive Classic Ins. Co., </em>379 Md. 301, 307, 841 A.2d 858 (2004). Therefore, the principles of statutory construction frame our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">The interpretation of a statute is a judicial function. <em>Salomon, </em>379 Md. at 307, 841 A.2d 858; <em>Bennett v.

Supervisor of Assessments for Prince George\u2019s County, </em>138 Md.App. 589, 619, 773 A.2d 535 (2001). Our primary goal in construing a statute is to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the Legislature. <em>Johnson v.

However, it expressly conferred a right of appeal from a final order issued by the chief following a guilty finding.

The LEOBR does not provide that a terminated action is final, from which an appeal may be lodged. In the context of a finding of guilty, however, the statute speaks several times of final orders and the right of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-9\">To illustrate, the statute provides that, under P.S. \u00a7 8-108(a)(4), when the accused is found guilty, the Board must reconvene, receive evidence, and make further recommendations to the chief. Under P.S. \u00a7 3-108(d)(l)(ii), upon a finding of guilt and suggested discipline by the Board, the matter is then forwarded to the chief for review, and the chief is required to \u201cissue a final order.\u201d P.S. \u00a7 3-108(d)(2) specifically provides that the \u201cfinal order and decision of the chief\u201d is \u201cbinding\u201d and \u201cthen may be appealed in accordance with Section 3-109____\u201d But, the chiefs final order is issued only when <em>the Board renders a finding of guilt. </em>Nowhere does the statute authorize the chief to render a final order upon the Board\u2019s finding of not guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-12\">We also look to P.S. \u00a7 3-108(c)(l). It provides for two special types of LEOBR cases in which \u201cthe decision of the hearing board as to findings of fact and any penalty is final.... \u201d These are (1) cases in which the chief is an eyewitness; and (2) cases in which a collective bargaining agreement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>concerning finality of the Board\u2019s decision is at issue.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In such cases, the chief does not review the Board\u2019s recommendations for punishment, nor does the chief issue a final order and decision. Although the chief is bypassed, P.S. \u00a7 3-108(c)(2) nonetheless provides that the Board\u2019s final decision \u201cthen may be appealed\u201d in accordance with P.S. \u00a7 3-109(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">Even if we assume, without deciding, that the phrase \u201cany penalty,\u201d as used in P.S. \u00a7 3-108(c)(l), encompasses cases in which the Board does not impose a penalty (because the Board finds the officer not guilty), P.S. \u00a7 3-108(c)(2) contains express language that confers the right of appeal to both the officer and the Commission. This demonstrates that the General Assembly was well aware of how to confer a right of appeal. Yet, such language is noticeably absent in P.S. \u00a7 3-108(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">Similarly, elsewhere in LEOBR, the General Assembly expressly granted to the police agency the right of review in the circuit court. Under P.S. \u00a7 3-107(d)(4), the chief may file a motion to compel compliance with subpoenas for testimony or evidence. This, too, underscores that the absence of comparable language in P.S. \u00a7 3-108(a)(3) was by design.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">The Commission suggests that the language \u201cterminates the action\u201d is equivalent to the finality language that appears in the statute in the context of a guilty finding. We disagree. Because the Legislature used express language in P.S. \u00a7 3-108(d)(2) regarding the officer\u2019s right to appeal a finding of guilty, which does not appear in P.S. \u00a7 3-108(a)(3) regarding a not guilty finding, the logical construction of the statutory scheme buttresses our view that the Legislature did not intend to confer on the police department a right of appeal to the circuit court from a Board\u2019s not guilty disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-8\">In each of the previously discussed provisions of the LEOBR concerning final orders, the Legislature used express language to grant the right of appeal, demonstrating that the Legislature knew how to craft a right of appeal when it saw fit to do so. We agree with Anderson that the \u201clegislature would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>have framed an equally specific designation or a general statement concerning judicial review of not guilty decisions if it had intended to grant such a right to the agency.\u201d Consequently, we are satisfied that the Legislature intended to distinguish between a guilty finding that is final and thus appealable, and an acquittal that ends the matter and is not appealable.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">We also find support for our view in \u201cthe ancient and sound rule of construction known as <em>inclusio unius est exclusio alterius.\u201d Price v. State, </em>378 Md. 378, 389, 835 A.2d 1221 (2003); <em>see Gillespie v. State, </em>370 Md. 219, 222, 804 A.2d 426 (2002); <em>Dodds v. Simmer, </em>339 Md. 540, 554, 663 A.2d 1318 (1995). The General Assembly easily could have stated that a terminated action is final and appealable \u2014 language it used elsewhere on several occasions in the context of a guilty finding. By articulating the statutory requirements for determining finality only with respect to guilty decisions, and expressly authorizing the right of judicial review only as to them, the Legislature signaled its intent to preclude judicial review of a not guilty decision rendered by the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">In addition, we are guided by what the Court said in <em>Miner v. Novotny, </em>304 Md. 164, 173-74, 498 A.2d 269 (1985), involving a defamation action brought by a law enforcement officer against a person who previously filed a brutality complaint against the officer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-6\">The LEOBR was enacted by the General Assembly in 1974, and <em>was designed to provide a law-enforcement officer covered by the statute with substantial procedural safeguards during any inquiry into his conduct which could lead to the imposition of a disciplinary sanction....</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-7\">\u201cThe [LEOBR] looks to what is essentially a two-phase administrative process. The first phase involves an internal investigation to determine whether there is some substance to the complaint or suspicion. If it appears that there is, a recommendation for some disciplinary action is made. At that point, phase two begins \u2014 an adjudicatory hearing before a departmental hearing board to determine (1) whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>the charge itself is valid, and (2) if so, what the punishment should be. <em>If the board finds the officer innocent of the charge, that ends the proceeding. </em>If it finds him guilty, it then makes a recommendation to the chief of police as to an appropriate punishment. <em>The chief is bound by a determination of innocence, but not a proposed punishment in the event of a finding of guilt. </em>As <em>to that, his decision (rather than that of the Board) is final.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">(Emphasis added; citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">It is also salient that the provisions for judicial review under the APA, set forth in S.G. \u00a7 10-222, are not conterminous with the judicial review provisions under P.S. \u00a7 8-109. As we have seen, S.G. \u00a7 10-222(a) confers on any aggrieved party the right of judicial review in the circuit court. In contrast, P.S. \u00a7 3-109(a) merely provides that, to the extent that an appeal lies from an administrative decision under \u00a7 3-108, it \u201cshall be taken to the circuit court____\u201d P.S. \u00a7 3-109(a) does not contain the \u201caggrieved party\u201d language that appears in S.G. \u00a7 10-222(a); such terminology is not used until P.S. \u00a7 3-109(b), which authorizes an aggrieved party who loses in circuit court to then appeal to this Court. As we construe P.S. \u00a7 3-109(b), it authorizes the Commission to appeal to this Court when an officer who was previously found guilty by the Board subsequently prevails in an appeal to the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">As we noted, principles of statutory construction permit us to consult the dictionary to elucidate terms that are not defined in the statute. In looking to the dictionary, we are convinced that the Legislature carefully chose the phrase \u201cterminates the action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b601-9\">Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1511 (8th Ed.2004) defines \u201cterminate\u201d as: \u201c1. To put an end to; to bring to an end. 2. To end; to conclude.\u201d It defines \u201ctermination\u201d as follows: \u201cThe act of ending something; EXTINGUISHMENT.\u201d Similarly, Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary 1289 (11th ed.2004) defines \u201cterminate\u201d as \u201ccoming to an end ... to form the conclusion of ... to serve as an ending, limit, or boundary. ...\u201d Further, it defines \u201ctermination\u201d as the \u201cend in time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>or existence: CONCLUSION....\u201d As we see it, the Legislature used the phrase \u201cterminates the action\u201d to express its intention that, upon an acquittal, the administrative proceeding is concluded in its entirety; this necessarily forecloses the police agency\u2019s right to judicial review of the Board\u2019s not guilty finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">The case of <em>In re Valerie H., </em>310 Md. 113, 527 A.2d 42 (1987), supports our view. There, the Court of Appeals was asked to determine whether a juvenile court order \u201cdischarging a local department of social services from further custodial responsibility over a child also serves to terminate the juvenile court\u2019s continuing jurisdiction over that child.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 115, 527 A.2d 42.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">In that case, Valerie was found to be a CINA and was committed to the Department of Social Services. <em>Id. </em>at 115, 527 A.2d 42. Eight years later, when she was returned to her mother\u2019s care, the juvenile court issued an order that rescinded the commitment and \u201cdischarged\u201d the department from further responsibility for the care, custody, and supervision of the child. <em>Id. </em>Three years later, Valerie was again placed in foster care, and the agency petitioned the court for a recommitment order. <em>Id. </em>at 116, 527 A.2d 42. However, by then Valerie had turned eighteen and was ineligible for consideration as a CINA under a new petition. Instead, she could only receive foster care services if she were recommitted to the department under the original CINA adjudication. The juvenile master denied the department\u2019s request for a hearing to review Valerie\u2019s foster care placement on the ground that the commitment had been terminated and thus the case was closed. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">The Court looked to the dictionary definitions of \u201cterminate\u201d and \u201cdischarge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 118, 527 A.2d 42. It reasoned that the language in the order \u201cdischarging\u201d the department from further responsibility for Valerie when she was returned to her mother did not amount to a termination of the juvenile court\u2019s jurisdiction. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>Implicit in the Court\u2019s decision was the view that, if the juvenile court had used a variation of the word \u201ctermination\u201d in its order, then such an order would have ended the existence of the juvenile court\u2019s jurisdiction, and the court would not have been able to recommit Valerie. Because the order used the term \u201cdischarge,\u201d coupled with the presumption of a juvenile court\u2019s continuing jurisdiction, the Court held that the juvenile court\u2019s jurisdiction was not terminated. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">In the context of this case, we are satisfied that appellant fares no better under the APA; the APA does not control the issue of judicial review. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">P.S. \u00a7 3-102(a) states that the LEOBR \u201csupersedes any other law of the State ... that conflicts\u201d with it. In our view, it is significant that the judicial review authorized by the LEOBR is not as broad as the judicial review authorized under the APA.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">As we noted earlier, P.S. \u00a7 3-109(a) does not confer a right of review on any aggrieved party. In contrast, S.G. \u00a7 10-222(a) makes clear that any aggrieved party may appeal. As we construe P.S. \u00a7 3-109(b), it confers on the party who loses in the circuit court the right of appeal to this Court. This means that, in the event that an officer found guilty then appeals to the circuit court and ultimately prevails there, \u00a7 3-109(b) would allow the police agency to pursue an appeal to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-8\">Because a grant to the Commission under the APA of a right to judicial review of an adverse trial board decision conflicts with the LEOBR, appellant cannot find safe harbor in the APA. As to the Commission\u2019s right to judicial review, the statutory silence in P.S. \u00a7 3 \u2014 108(a)(3) is deafening. We hold that, under P.S. \u00a7 3-108(a)(3), the Commission is not entitled to judicial review of a not guilty finding rendered by the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-9\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.
