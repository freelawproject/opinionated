Appellant was sentenced to a total of twenty-three years and four months\u2019 incarceration and ordered to pay restitution in the amount of $490.75. He presents four questions on appeal, which we have slightly rephrased as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-9\">1. Did the circuit court err in admitting hearsay in violation of appellant\u2019s right to confrontation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-10\">2. Did the circuit court err in refusing to instruct the jury on the defenses of necessity, self-defense, and mistake of fact?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-11\">3. Did the circuit court err in refusing to propound appellant\u2019s requested <em>voir dire </em>questions?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-12\">4. Did the circuit court err by not merging appellant\u2019s sentences for malicious destruction of property into his sentences for burglary?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-13\">We agree that, under the facts of this case, separate sentences for malicious destruction of property and fourth degree burglary should not have been imposed. In all other respects, we affirm the judgments of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-14\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b131-15\">Appellant met his wife, Catherine Burns, about three years prior to the night of March 16, 2003. When they met, they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>both abused alcohol and drugs. Appellant entered a treatment program in September 2002, and testified that he had not used drugs since that time. Appellant also attempted unsuccessfully to obtain help for Burns, calling her parole officer, his parole officer, his rehabilitation counselor, the Family Assistance Network, Social Services, Memorial Hospital at Easton, the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office, and Burns\u2019 parents. He asked clerks at the District Court of Maryland for Talbot County and the Circuit Court for Talbot County about an emergency petition, but was told such an order could not be issued unless Burns had been suicidal in the last 48 hours. Appellant was told to stay away from Burns and to \u201cworry about [his] own self.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">In the weeks leading up to March 16, 2003, appellant decided to stop calling Burns and would not take phone calls from her. On March 12, 2003, Burns left a message on appellant\u2019s cell phone saying she was at the hospital. Appellant originally \u201cwasn\u2019t going to return the call and then ... said no, I got to call her at the hospital. I\u2019ve got to see what\u2019s wrong with her.\u201d He went to the hospital and learned that Burns was pregnant. Appellant was initially unhappy about the pregnancy because he thought Burns was a \u201ccrack addict.\u201d He had a prior experience with a girlfriend\u2019s grandson who was a \u201ccrack baby\u201d who was \u201calmost eight years old and never walked, talked ... [and was] fed through a tube in his stomach.\u201d But, appellant reconciled with Burns, and the two made plans to celebrate the pregnancy on March 14, 2003. When appellant returned from work that night, Burns was missing and would not return his phone calls. He searched for two days, and on March 16, 2003, he called a number that Burns had stored in his cell phone for the residence of Robert Lambert. When the man who answered denied knowing Burns, appellant told him: \u201cI\u2019m the last person that you want to get riled up right now. I\u2019m not in no mood for it. I\u2019ve been looking for her for two days.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">Appellant offered $100 to anyone who could provide him with the location of his wife. Shortly thereafter, he was told <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>he could find Burns at an apartment building on Bay Street in Easton, Maryland. At around 9:30 p.m. on the night of March 16, 2003, appellant broke the glass of the front door at 17 Bay Street, put his hand inside the house, and tried unsuccessfully to unlock the door. Appellant \u201cthought that was the place where [Burns] would be at. Because her car was parked closer to that building several weeks before.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">William Lacates, who lived at that address, asked appellant who he was and what he was doing. Appellant told Lacates he was looking for Burns. Lacates replied that no one by that name lived there. Lacates\u2019 mother, Robin Patrick, also told appellant that Burns had never been at their residence. Appellant told them that Burns was pregnant with his child, smoking crack cocaine, and that he \u201cwanted to put her into rehab.\u201d After 10 or 15 minutes, appellant realized he was at the wrong address, apologized, and offered to pay for the damage to the door. He also requested that Lacates and Patrick not call the police. Appellant\u2019s demeanor was described as \u201c[a]ggressive, angry perhaps,\u201d but he never threatened to injure anyone in the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">Appellant proceeded to an apartment building located at 13 Bay Street. Burns was visiting Lambert in apartment 1, and, according to Lambert, the two had smoked crack cocaine that night. Appellant recalled that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A2R\">there was a set of doors in front of going into the apartment, into the hallway like a vestibule there. I knocked one of the panes out because it was locked. I unlocked that door and went in ... As soon as I got through the french doors, I went to Apartment 1 and there was like four big panels on the door and I knocked one out closest to where, away from the hinges, closest to where the locks would be up top.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">Appellant used a baseball bat to break through the door and saw Burns sitting on the couch with what he believed to be a crack pipe in her hand.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As appellant was reaching through <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>the door, Lambert \u201cjumped up off the other end of the couch\u201d and started running toward him. Appellant testified that he saw something in Lambert\u2019s hand and \u201cwasn\u2019t going to take a chance,\u201d so he hit him once in the head with the baseball bat.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">Lambert testified that the last thing he could remember from the night of March 16, 2003, was fixing food in the kitchen. His next memory was waking up at the University of Maryland\u2019s Shock Trauma Center with \u201ctotal loss of hearing in [his] left ear.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> During trial, Lambert testified that he was still deaf in his left ear, and he was suffering from depression.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">Lambert recalled a telephone call from appellant a few days earlier during which appellant had threatened, \u201cif I come over and find Cathy in your apartment I will kill you,\u201d but he had never met appellant before. Lambert was asked at trial whether he had a knife in his hand when he was preparing food in the kitchen, and he replied that he \u201cmay have had a butter knife with [him] at the time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">After appellant struck Lambert, he grabbed Burns and \u201chalfway drug\u201d her back to his truck. The two struggled with each other inside the truck. According to appellant,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-8\">[Burns] kept trying to struggle. We were going down the road and I was hollering. You know, I lost it. I was, I was screaming. I was hollering. And she was trying to get away from, I thought she was going to jump out of the truck. I was trying to hold on [to] her. And I slapped her a few times to try to calm her down, stop her from what, from trying to get out or whatever.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b134-9\">Appellant \u201cslapped her\u201d on \u201cthe upper body, the upper torso [area].\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Eventually, near Route 50 and Chapel Road, Burns knocked the truck out of gear, and when appellant tried to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>grab the gearshift, Burns reached over and shut the ignition off. While appellant was trying to restart the truck, Burns jumped out. She ran toward the median, and appellant drove away.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">At approximately 10:06 p.m., Officer James Cathcart was driving down Chapel Road toward Route 50 in a marked patrol vehicle when a motorist flagged him down.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As a result of information he received from the motorist, Officer Cathcart drove west on Route 50. He saw a man get into a small white truck on the shoulder of eastbound Route 50 and drive away. When Officer Cathcart stopped his vehicle, he heard a woman\u2019s voice calling for help. He found Burns lying on a grassy portion of the median. Burns was without clothes from the waist up and had \u201cwhat seemed to be blood on her face.\u201d She was \u201cemotionally upset,\u201d crying to \u201cthe point where she was hysterical,\u201d and would not talk to Officer Cathcart. He radioed for an ambulance and for an additional unit to come to the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">Officer Cathcart put Burns into his patrol car and attempted to calm her down. Still crying, she only gave \u201cbits of information.\u201d She told Officer Cathcart that her name was Catherine, that appellant had \u201cassaulted her,\u201d that he lived on \u201cChapel Road,\u201d and that \u201cshe was at her friend\u2019s house, Robert Lambert, on Bay Street.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">An ambulance arrived and took Burns to the hospital. Officer Cathcart interviewed Burns at the hospital about one half hour after he had found her. Burns told Officer Cathcart the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-7\">[S]he was over a friend\u2019s house, Robert Lambert. Her husband came over. Kicked down the door. Hit Mr. Lambert in the head with a baseball bat. She continued to .tell me that after Mr. Lambert got hit with the baseball bat he had fell. And then [appellant] hit Ms. Burns with the baseball bat and dragged her out to his truck. Which was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>located outside. She said they got into the truck. They headed onto Route 822 which was the bypass. [Appellant] stopped the truck around Ruby Tuesday\u2019s that area. Pulled her out of the truck. Started hitting her some more. Ms. Burns told me that she dialed 911 and left the cell phone on so that way the dispatch or whoever could hear her screaming, so she could yell out a location where they were at. They got back in the truck headed back, headed onto Route 322 northbound towards Route 50, heading towards Black and Decker area. They made a right onto Route 50 heading eastbound. Ms. Burns told me they stopped the truck, [appellant] stopped the truck.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">After clarifying that Burns\u2019 account of the incident was in response to a question, Officer Cathcart continued,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-6\">Okay, they made a right on Route 50. [Appellant] stopped the truck in between Route 322 and Joppa Road on the eastbound lane of Route 50 on the shoulder. He then, Ms. Burns then told me that [appellant] dragged her out of the truck into the ditch and started hitting her again. Started choking her. Ms. Burns told me that when [appellant] was choking her that he said, I\u2019m going to kill you. Started choking her again. Ms. Burns said that [appellant] fell. She got up, ran across eastbound traffic into the median, and that\u2019s when I pulled up. And that\u2019s when [appellant] got into his truck and left.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">Sergeant Jarrell of the Easton Police Department, along with several other police officers, went to appellant\u2019s home to arrest him. The officers located appellant\u2019s vehicle behind the house and were given consent by appellant\u2019s house-mate to enter the residence. When Patrolman First Class Robert Bayliss announced that he was going to send his K-9 partner \u201cNitro\u201d into the house, appellant \u201ccame out of the living room with his hands up stating that he was surrendering.\u201d Officer Charles Frampton transported appellant to the police station. Appellant told Officer Frampton that his wife had been smoking crack with Lambert and that he had called Lambert earlier that day and told him to stay away from her. As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>Officer Frampton was placing appellant in a holding cell, appellant asked: \u201c[W]hat would you have done?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">Officer Greg Fellow testified that he responded to 13 Bay Street and \u201c[s]aw that the glass double doors that lead into the apartment building had one pane broken out of it. There was glass all over the floor.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> He also \u201cnoticed that the apartment number 1, which is the first door on the left, had the top panel broken out of it and there was wood pieces all over the ground, all over the floor, inside and outside the apartment.\u201d A steak knife and blood were observed on the floor in the living room and more blood was found in the kitchen.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">Officer Fellow saw Lambert and described him as having \u201ccuts on his head and hands and ... a j shaped red mark star[t]ing from the corner of the eye and working its way out to the ear. He also had blood coming out of his [left] ear.\u201d Lambert \u201c[c]ouldn\u2019t recall a lot of things. He had problems processing questions.\u201d No evidence of drugs or drug paraphernalia was recovered from Lambert\u2019s residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">Detective Yvonne Freeman met with Burns at the hospital. According to Detective Freeman, \u201cMs. Burns was very upset. She was crying____ She had bruises on her, I think around [the] neck. She had some bruises on her face ... [and] there were some bruises on her arms.\u201d After Detective Freeman left the hospital, she proceeded to the Easton police station where appellant was being detained. Appellant was read his <em>Miranda </em>rights and interviewed by Detective Freeman and Detective Gregory Hall.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Appellant\u2019s statement was consistent with the facts set out above. A transcript of the statement was admitted into evidence at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-9\">As the investigating officer, Detective Hall went to the 911-call center and received a tape recording (\u201cthe 911 recording\u201d) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>of a phone call made on the night of March 16, 2003. In the 911 recording, the dispatcher attempted to establish a conversation with the caller, but all that can be heard is appellant\u2019s and Burns\u2019 discourse inside the truck. Appellant yelled at Burns, asking her where she has been, and shouted numerous times, \u201cYou want to smoke crack and you\u2019re pregnant?\u201d Burns asks appellant throughout the 911 recording to \u201cplease stop hitting\u201d her and not to hurt her. Appellant also stated, \u201cI will kill you\u201d several times, to which Burns replied, \u201cDon\u2019t kill me, Joe. Don\u2019t kill me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">On December 29, 2003, appellant moved <em>in limine </em>to preclude admission of the 911 recording. At the motions hearing, appellant averred that Burns was not expected to testify. He argued that the recording was not admissible because the State could not lay a foundation as to who was on the tape; even if the 911 recording was a public record, the statements within it constituted hearsay; the statements on the tape could not be shown to be excited utterances; the dispatcher made inadmissible statements; and its admission would violate appellant\u2019s \u201cright to cross examination, his constitutional right.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The State responded that the recording was a record kept in the ordinary course of business; Burns\u2019 statements were excited utterances; and the tape contained admissions of a party opponent. The prosecutor further argued that there was no confrontation problem because \u201c[i]f hearsay is deemed admissible because it is a recognized exception to the rule, then the opportunity for cross examination [sic] is simply not afforded.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">The motions court found that the statements on the 911 recording were \u201cobviously an excited utterance on the part of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>the victim. And it was a recording made by the victim who was not- acting as a police agent and not made during the custody or interrogation of the [appellant].\u201d The motions court concluded that the 911 recording was admissible and the identity of the voices on the recording was a question of fact to be resolved by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">The case proceeded to trial on January 20, 2004, and lasted for three days. The 911 recording was admitted into evidence and played for the jury.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In his testimony at trial, appellant acknowledged that he heard himself on the 911 recording threatening to kill Burns, but maintained that he did not recall saying it. He conceded that he was \u201cprobably more mad at her at that point for what she did than [he] ever [was before],\u201d but stated that he was not mad enough to kill her or the \u201cunborn baby\u201d she was carrying. He maintained that he did not desire to harm anyone, but just wanted to stop Burns from using crack cocaine to protect the \u201cbaby\u201d she was carrying.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">Burns invoked the spousal privilege and refused to testify against appellant.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Her medical records from March 12 and March 13, 2003, were admitted into evidence to prove her toxicology levels and pregnancy. Additionally, her medical records from March 16, 2003, were admitted to show the injuries she suffered that night.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">The parties stipulated that April Bishop, Burns\u2019 probation officer, Carolyn George, appellant\u2019s probation officer, Lauren Carter of the Talbot County Addictions Program, and Sharon Dundin, appellant\u2019s addictions counselor, would have testified, if called, that appellant had telephoned them prior to the incident on March 16, 2003, to obtain help in getting Burns off crack cocaine. George would testify that she received numer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>ous calls from appellant, and Dundin would testify that appellant called and spoke to her two to three times a week. Carter would confirm appellant\u2019s testimony that he was told that an emergency petition would not work unless Burns was suicidal. The parties further stipulated that George, Carter, and Dundin had all told appellant that there was nothing he could do for Burns and that he should worry about himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">The parties also stipulated that Lionel H. Howland, an investigator employed by the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office, would have testified, if called, that \u201csome man called him ... [and] explained to him that his wife was doing crack and that she was pregnant and that he told this individual that based on the information he\u2019d given him there was nothing that [the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office] could do and advised him not to do anything stupid.\u201d Corporal Ronald Mills of the Easton Police Department would have testified that, on March 15, 2003, he responded to the Atlantic Budget Inn for a report of an unwanted subject. He encountered appellant \u201cwho was very upset [and] informed the officers that he was looking for his wife who was three months pregnant and who he believed was smoking crack ... Corporal Mills told [appellant] that if he did find his wife he should let the law handle it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">Edward James Tyler, appellant\u2019s former employer, testified that appellant had told him that Burns was smoking crack and staying away from home for days at a time. Tyler stated that, in the beginning of 2003, appellant told him that Burns was pregnant and that he did not want her to smoke crack any more. He said that appellant was angry, but mainly concerned for Burns and the baby. He advised appellant that \u201che needed to get away from [Burns].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">The jury convicted appellant of second degree assault on Lambert, second degree assault on Burns, false imprisonment of Burns, fourth degree burglary at 17 Bay Street, fourth degree burglary at 13 Bay Street, malicious destruction of property at 17 Bay Street, and two counts of malicious de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>struction of property at 13 Bay Street.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Additional facts will be presented in our discussion of the issues presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">I. Admission of Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">Appellant\u2019s first contention is that the circuit court erred in admitting three pieces of evidence: the 911 recording; Officer Cathcart\u2019s testimony concerning statements Burns made to him while in his patrol car; and Officer Cathcart\u2019s testimony concerning statements Burns made to him at the hospital. Appellant argues that each piece of evidence contained hearsay, and that its admission violated appellant\u2019s right to confrontation. He contends that none of the statements was an excited utterance, and asserts that all were testimonial in nature, and, thereby, precluded by the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">The State counters that the recording of the 911 call was admissible as a statement by a party opponent and that \u201c[Burns\u2019] statements were admissible, not for their truth, but to put [appellant\u2019s] statements in context.\u201d The State further contends that appellant\u2019s objections to Officer Cathcart\u2019s testimony were not preserved for appellate review on Confrontation Clause grounds, and that the statements were admissible under the excited utterance exception to the hearsay rule. Finally, the State argues that any error in permitting the three statements was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-9\">\n<em>a. Statements Made in the 911 Recording</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Au1\">1. The Confrontation Clause</p>\n<p id=\"b141-10\">The Confrontation Clause of the United States Constitution provides that, \u201c[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>cused shall enjoy the right ... to be confronted with the witnesses against him.\u201d U.S. Const. Amend. VI. The protections of the Confrontation Clause are applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>Pointer v. Texas, </em>380 U.S. 400, 403, 85 S.Ct. 1065, 13 L.Ed.2d 923 (1965). The Confrontation Clause\u2019s counterpart in Maryland\u2019s Constitution is found in Article 21 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, which provides that, \u201cin all criminal prosecutions, every man hath a right ... to be confronted with the witnesses against him,\u201d and the two clauses are read in <em>pari materia. </em>Md.Code (1958, 2003 Repl. Vol.) Art. 21 of the Constitutions Article. <em>Craig v. State, </em>322 Md. 418, 430, 588 A.2d 328 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">In <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>the United States Supreme Court held that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-5\">[wjhere nontestimonial hearsay is at issue, it is wholly consistent with the Framers\u2019 design to afford the States flexibility in their development of hearsay law____Where testimonial evidence is at issue, however, the Sixth Amendment demands what the common law required: unavailability and a prior opportunity for cross-examination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">541 U.S. at 68, 124 S.Ct. 1354. The Court of Appeals recently reiterated this principle, stating that, \u201cwhen an out-of-court statement qualifies as testimonial, the Constitution conditions its admission on the unavailability of the witness and a prior opportunity to cross-examine.\u201d <em>State v. Snowden, </em>385 Md. 64, 79, 867 A.2d 314 (2005). In determining whether a statement made by an unavailable declarant is precluded by the Confrontation Clause, the initial focus is directed to whether the statement is \u201ctestimonial\u201d in nature. <em>Id. </em>If the statement is deemed testimonial, then it is subject to the strict rule enunciated in <em>Crawford </em>and reaffirmed by <em>Snowden, </em>but if it is nontestimonial, it need only conform to Maryland\u2019s rules regarding hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-9\">The <em>Crawford </em>Court declined to articulate a precise definition of a \u201ctestimonial\u201d statement, but noted that \u201cinterrogations by law enforcement officers fall squarely within\u201d the meaning. <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 53, 124 S.Ct. 1354. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>\u201cuniting theme underlying the <em>Crawford </em>holding is that when a statement is made in the course of a criminal investigation initiated by the government, the Confrontation Clause forbids its introduction unless the defendant has had an opportunity to cross-examine the declarant.\u201d <em>Snowden, </em>385 Md. at 81, 867 A.2d 314. In <em>Snowden, </em>the Court of Appeals observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-4\">In the context of \u201cpolice interrogations [or their functional equivalent],\u201d we are directed by <em>Crawford </em>to conclude that the proper standard to apply to determine whether a statement is testimonial is whether the statements were made under circumstances that would lead an objective declarant reasonably to believe that the statement would be available for use at a later trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b143-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 83, 867 A.2d 314. <em>See also Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 51, 124 S.Ct. 1354 (stating that \u201cvarious formulations of this core class of \u2018testimonial\u2019 statements exist: <em>\u2018ex-parte </em>in-court testimony or its functional equivalent \u2014 that is, material such as affidavits, custodial interrogation, prior testimony that the defendant was unable to cross-examine, or similar pretrial statements that declarants would reasonably expect to be used prosecutorially\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">2. The 911 Recordings and <em>Crawford</em></p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">Appellant asserts that the statements in the 911 recording were testimonial because \u201c[i]t is common knowledge that by calling 911 an alleged victim of a crime creates a record which may be used in a subsequent prosecution.\u201d He recognizes that since <em>Crawford </em>there is a split of authority regarding the admissibility of 911 recordings, but urges that we find the statements made on the 911 recording in this case to be testimonial.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">The State argues that the \u201cbetter reasoned\u201d cases find 911 calls to be nontestimonial, citing <em>People v. Corella, </em>122 Cal.App.4th 461, 18 Cal.Rptr.3d 770, 775 (2004), which held that 911 recordings \u201cbear no indicia common to the official and formal quality of the various statements deemed testimonial by <em>Crawford.\u201d </em>The State also asserts that, in this case, \u201cit is unnecessary to resolve the question of whether recordings of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>911 calls generally should be considered \u2018testimonial\u2019 under <em>Crawford.\u201d </em>Here, the recording was a conversation between appellant and Burns with occasional interjections by the dispatcher, and not the typical \u201creport and/or request for help,\u201d followed by a series of questions and answers between the caller and dispatcher.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">We need not decide whether 911 recordings in general are \u201ctestimonial\u201d in nature to resolve the issue before us because it is sufficient to conclude that the 911 recording in this case clearly was nontestimonial. Burns dialed 911 and allowed the phone to remain on while she struggled with appellant. Neither her statements nor the statements of appellant were in response to police questioning or the functional equivalent thereof. There was no \u201cknowing\u201d response to a line of structured questioning taking place in an investigative environment. <em>Cf. Snowden, </em>385 Md. at 84, 867 A.2d 314 (finding under the facts of that case a child\u2019s statements to a sexual abuse investigator with the express purpose of creating testimony for a later prosecution constituted the functional equivalent of formal police questioning, and, accordingly, the statements were deemed testimonial).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">Furthermore, we disagree with appellant that Burns knew of the evidentiary significance of such a recording when she dialed 911. To the contrary, the primary concern of a reasonable person in Burns\u2019 situation would have been escaping or, at the very least, obtaining help, not creating evidence for use in a future prosecution of her assailant. That is consistent with her statement to Officer Cathcart. The evidence at trial established that, in the moments leading up to the 911 recording, appellant dragged Burns out of Lambert\u2019s apartment to his truck. Appellant then struggled with Burns in the truck, striking her in the upper body and threatening several times to kill her. We find nothing in the record that suggests Burns knew, or had any objective reason to know, that the statements made during the 911 call could be later used against appellant during his prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>3. The 911 Recording and Hearsay</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">Generally, hearsay is inadmissible as evidence because of its inherent untrustworthiness. <em>Parker v. State, </em>365 Md. 299, 312, 778 A.2d 1096 (2001); Md. Rule 5-802 (\u201cExcept as otherwise provided by these rules or permitted by applicable constitutional provisions or statutes, hearsay is not admissible.\u201d). If a nontestimonial out-of-court statement made by an unavailable declarant contains hearsay, the hearsay must fall within an exception to the hearsay rule or bear \u201cparticularized guarantees of trustworthiness\u201d in order to be admitted into evidence. <em>Ohio v. Roberts, </em>448 U.S. 56, 66, 100 S.Ct. 2531, 65 L.Ed.2d 597 (1980).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>See also Rollins v. State, </em>161 Md.App. 34, 60, 866 A.2d 926 (\u201cthe introduction of hearsay will not violate a defendant\u2019s right to confrontation if the hearsay is within a \u2018firmly rooted\u2019 exception to the rule against hearsay or bears \u2018particularized guarantees of trustworthiness\u2019 \u201d), <em>cert. granted, </em>387 Md. 462, 875 A.2d 767 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">Maryland Rule 5 \u2014 803(b)(2) defines the excited utterance exception to the hearsay rule as \u201c[a] statement relating to a startling event or condition made while the declarant was under the stress of excitement caused by the event or condition.\u201d In <em>Parker, </em>the Court of Appeals stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-7\">The essence of the excited utterance exception is the inability of the declarant to have reflected on the events about which the statement is concerned. It requires a startling event and a spontaneous statement which is the result of the declarant\u2019s reaction to the occurrence. The rationale for overcoming the inherent untrustworthiness of hearsay is that the situation produced such an effect on the declarant as to render his reflective capabilities inoperative. The admissibility of evidence under this exception is, therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>judged by the spontaneity of the declarant\u2019s statement and an analysis of whether it was the result of thoughtful consideration or the product of the exciting event.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">365 Md. at 313, 778 A.2d 1096 (quoting <em>Mouzone v. State, </em>294 Md. 692, 697, 452 A.2d 661 (1982) (internal citations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">It is up to the proponent of a statement claimed to be an excited utterance to establish that the statement was spontaneous rather than a result of reflection. <em>Parker, </em>365 Md. at 313, 778 A.2d 1096. \u201c \u2018[I]t must [also] be established that the exciting influence has not lost its sway or been dissipated by meditation.\u2019\u201d <em>Harmony v. State, </em>88 Md.App. 306, 320, 594 A.2d 1182 (1991) (citations omitted). In making the determination of whether a statement is properly characterized as an \u201cexcited utterance,\u201d we examine the \u201ctotality of the circumstances.\u201d <em>West v. State, </em>124 Md.App. 147, 163, 720 A.2d 1253 (1998) (quoting <em>State v. Harrell, </em>348 Md. 69, 77, 702 A.2d 723 (1997)). The lapse in time and spontaneity of the statement are factors to be considered in the analysis, but neither is dispositive. <em>Id. </em>at 163-64, 720 A.2d 1253.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">The determination of whether to admit a statement as an excited utterance lies within the discretion of the trial or motions court. <em>Harmony, </em>88 Md.App. at 321, 594 A.2d 1182. \u201cAn appellate court should not reverse a trial [or motions] court\u2019s decision on the admissibility of an excited utterance absent an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>West, </em>124 Md.App. at 163, 720 A.2d 1253.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">In this case, the motions court found that \u201cobviously [the statements in the 911 recording are] an excited utterance on the part of the victim. And it was a recording made by the victim who was not acting as a police agent and not made during the custody or interrogation of the [appellant].\u201d Indeed, the discourse between Burns and appellant occurred during the commission of an ongoing crime. Burns\u2019 supplications for appellant to stop hitting her were in direct response to actions taken by appellant inside the truck. Nothing suggests that the statements were not made spontaneously while under the stress of excitement cased by an \u201cexciting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>event.\u201d In fact, the 911 recording occurred during the \u201cexciting event,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>the assault on Burns inside appellant\u2019s truck.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Consequently, there was no abuse of discretion in ruling that the statements made by Burns on the recording were excited utterances.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">\n<em>b. Statement to Officer Cathcart in the Patrol Car</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">The jury heard Officer Cathcart\u2019s testimony concerning the statements Burns made to him while in his patrol car. Appellant asserted that the remarks made in the patrol car constituted \u201chearsay,\u201d and that Burns had calmed down so that \u201cenough time had passed, [and the remarks were] no longer an excited utterance.\u201d <footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The circuit court ruled that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>Burns was \u201cstill in a state of excitement and that her utterances were excited utterances at that time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">When Officer Cathcart found Burns, she was unclothed from the waist up and had blood on her face. She could not provide an unbroken coherent statement, but rather gave \u201cbits of information.\u201d She was crying, \u201cemotionally upset,\u201d and \u201cat the point where she was hysterical.\u201d The event causing Burns\u2019 hysteria had ended only minutes before.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\"><em>Dennis v. State, </em>105 Md.App. 687, 661 A.2d 175 (1995), is instructive. In <em>Dennis, </em>statements were made at the scene of the crime by the defendant\u2019s wife, Robin. She invoked the spousal privilege and refused to testify against her husband, who was charged with first-degree murder, burglary, and unlawful use of a handgun. The officer that recorded the statement testified that he arrived \u201c \u2018within two minutes after he was called,\u2019 \u201d and that Robin was \u201c \u2018very upset, crying, screaming, almost to the point where she was hysterical.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 700, 661 A.2d 175. Based solely on the officer\u2019s testimony concerning Robin\u2019s demeanor and state of mind, the circuit court found that the statements were \u201cexcited utterances.\u201d This Court affirmed stating that, \u201cbased on [the officer\u2019s] testimony, we can find no error in the court\u2019s determination that her immediately contemporaneous statements to the officer related to what obviously was a startling event and were made while she was still under the stress of the excitement caused by that event.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">In this case, Officer Cathcart testified concerning Burns\u2019 demeanor and mental state. He stated that when he appeared on the scene and attempted to question her, Bums was \u201cemotionally upset\u201d and \u201chysterical.\u201d We are not persuaded that the circuit court abused its discretion in admitting Burns\u2019 statements as an excited utterance.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>c. <em>Statements to Officer Cathcart at the Hospital</em></p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">Appellant objected to the statements made by Burns at the hospital, without specifying a basis. The circuit court initially sustained the objection \u201cwithout some foundation as to what we\u2019re speaking of with respect to time frame.\u201d The prosecutor established that the statement had been made about a half hour after the incident and Officer Cathcart testified that Burns \u201cwas cooperating as far as, she was answering the questions. She was crying off and on. But as far as her mental state she was telling me what she wanted to tell me as far as what happened.\u201d The circuit court then overruled the objection and granted appellant\u2019s counsel a continuing objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">A general objection, like the one appellant made to the circuit court, \u201cis sufficient to preserve <em>all </em>grounds of objection which may exist.\u201d <footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>State v. Jones, </em>138 Md.App. 178, 218, 771 A.2d 407 (2001) (quoting <em>Grier v. State, </em>351 Md. 241, 250, 718 A.2d 211 (1998)) (emphasis added). <em>Compare </em>footnote 14, <em>supra </em>(when there is a specific objection only the grounds specifically stated are preserved for appellate review). On appeal, appellant argues that Burns\u2019 statements at the hospital violated his right to confrontation and asserts that they do not fall within any exception to the hearsay rule. We agree that the statements are \u201ctestimonial\u201d in nature. <em>See </em>discussion, <em>supra, </em>Part 1(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">Officer Cathcart visited Burns at the hospital during his investigation of that night\u2019s incident. Burns\u2019 statements were elicited by a direct question from Officer Cathcart at least a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>half hour after she had been assaulted. Officer Cathcart was clearly investigating the incident and questioning Burns to further the investigation. Although Burns was \u201ccrying off and on\u201d she did not \u201cbreak down in tears ... to any questions [Officer Cathcart] might have asked her.\u201d The circumstances were such that a reasonable person would realize that their statements to the police incriminating appellant would be \u201cavailable for use at a later trial.\u201d <em>Snowden, </em>385 Md. at 83, 867 A.2d 314. In fact, the Court of Appeals has said that statements are testimonial when elicited by government officers \u201cwith an eye toward trial,\u201d and that \u201cstatements made to police officers in the course of an investigation [are] especially testimonial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 81, 867 A.2d 314. When statements are \u201ctestimonial,\u201d <em>Crawford </em>dictates that the witness be unavailable and that the accused have a right to cross-examine. <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 68, 124 S.Ct. 1354. Because Burns invoked the spousal privilege at trial, appellant was not given the opportunity to cross-examine her. Therefore, the statements made by Burns at the hospital were erroneously admitted into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">Even if the statements were not testimonial, they encompassed inadmissible hearsay. Although Burns was \u201cstill a little upset\u201d and \u201ccrying,\u201d \u201cthe essence of the excited utterance exception is the inability of the declarant to have reflected on the events about which the statement is concerned.\u201d <em>Parker, </em>365 Md. at 313, 778 A.2d 1096. Although the circuit court found the relatively short, half hour time period between the incident and Burns\u2019 statement persuasive, time .alone is not dispositive. <em>See Mouzone, </em>294 Md. at 701, 452 A.2d 661 (observing that, although the declarant \u201cmay still have been somewhat shaken by the incident, it was beyond credibility to suggest that her coherent and descriptive responses\u201d were \u201cimpulsive or spontaneous\u201d). There is nothing in Officer Cathcart\u2019s description of Burns\u2019 mental or emotional state to suggest that she was reacting without deliberation. In fact, Officer Cathcart\u2019s testimony was that Burns told him \u201cwhat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>she wanted to tell [him].\u201d The detailed nature and amount of information given to Officer Cathcart also indicates that the statement did not constitute an excited utterance.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">Nevertheless, the State contends that any error in admitting the statements in this case was harmless. \u201cIn order for the error to be harmless, we must be convinced, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the error in no way influenced the verdict.\u201d <em>Weitzel v. State, </em>384 Md. 451, 461, 863 A.2d 999 (2004). We must \u201c \u2018be satisfied that there is no reasonable possibility that the evidence complained of \u2014 whether erroneously admitted or excluded \u2014 may have contributed to the rendition of the guilty verdict.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rosenberg v. State, </em>129 Md.App. 221, 253, 741 A.2d 533 (1999) (quoting <em>Dorsey v. State, </em>276 Md. 638, 659, 350 A.2d 665 (1976)).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">Maryland Code (2002) \u00a7 3-203 of the Criminal Law Article (\u201cC.L.\u201d) prohibits a person from committing an assault. C.L. \u00a7 3-201 instructs that \u201cassault\u201d encompasses the crimes of assault, battery, and assault and battery, which retain their judicially determined meanings. Battery is traditionally defined as the unlawful application of force against another, either directly or indirectly. <em>Lamb v. State, </em>93 Md.App. 422, 446-48, 613 A.2d 402 (1992). Battery includes \u201ckissing another without consent, touching or tapping another, jostling another out of the way, throwing water upon another, rudely seizing a person\u2019s clothes, cutting off a person\u2019s hair, throwing food at another, or participating in an unlawful fight. On the other hand, a battery may take the form of a severe beating.\u201d <em>State v. Duckett, </em>306 Md. 503, 510-11, 510 A.2d 253 (1986) (internal citations omitted). The crime is committed no matter how slight the injury to the victim. <em>Lamb, </em>93 Md.App. at 447, 613 A.2d 402.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">False imprisonment, a common law offense, is the \u201cunlawful detention of another person against his [or her] will.\u201d <em>Midgett v. State, </em>216 Md. 26, 39, 139 A.2d 209 (1958). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>\u201cAlthough there are other possible catalytic agents for the unlawful confinement, such as fraud or a false claim of legal authority, false imprisonment is most frequently the product of either an assault or a battery.\u201d <em>Lamb, </em>93 Md.App. at 470-71, 613 A.2d 402 (footnote omitted).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">Burns\u2019 recollection of the night, for the most part, mirrors that of appellant\u2019s own testimony and police statement. Burns told Officer Cathcart-that while she was visiting Lambert, appellant \u201c[k]icked down the door\u201d and \u201c[h]it Mr. Lambert in the head with a baseball bat.\u201d The only contradictory assertion made by Burns was that appellant threw her out of the truck (he says that she jumped out of the truck) and that appellant also hit her with the baseball bat. Appellant admitted during trial and in his statement to the police, which was admitted into evidence, that he broke into the homes located at 13 and 17 Bay Street, that he hit Lambert with the baseball bat, that he dragged Burns out to his truck, and that he would not let her leave. These admissions by appellant provided ample evidence to convict him of the second degree assault on Lambert and the false imprisonment of Burns. Appellant also admitted, both at trial and in his statement to the police, to striking Burns in the upper body with his hands. These admissions, along with Burns\u2019 medical records from the night of the incident, clearly established that appellant was guilty of the second degree assault on Burns.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">Defense counsel stated in his opening argument, \u201c[ijt\u2019s really not a question so much of what happened but why it happened.\u201d In closing argument, he summarized the essence of the defense theory by asking the jurors \u201cwhat would you have done differently.\u201d We are convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the statements made by Burns at the hospital in no way influenced the verdict in this case. Consequently, any error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>II. Jury Instructions</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">Maryland Rule 4-325(c) provides, in pertinent part, that \u201c[t]he court may, and at the request of any party shall, instruct the jury as to the applicable law.\u201d When requested to do so by a party, the trial court is required to give an instruction that correctly states the applicable law if it has not been fairly covered in the instructions actually given. <em>State v. Martin, </em>329 Md. 351, 356, 619 A.2d 992 (1993); <em>Mack v. State, </em>300 Md. 583, 592, 479 A.2d 1344 (1984). The circuit court need not give the instruction, however, unless the defendant has produced \u201csome evidence\u201d sufficient to give rise to a jury issue on the defense. <em>Dykes v. State, </em>319 Md. 206, 216, 571 A.2d 1251 (1990). The phrase some evidence, \u201ccalls for no more than what it says \u2014 \u2018some,\u2019 as that word is understood in common, everyday usage. It need not rise to the level of \u2018beyond a reasonable doubt\u2019 or \u2018clear and convincing\u2019 or \u2018preponderance.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 216-17, 571 A.2d 1251.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\"> \u201cWhether the evidence is sufficient to generate the desired instruction is a question of law for the judge.\u201d <em>Roach v. State, </em>358 Md. 418, 428, 749 A.2d 787 (2000). Our review is limited to determining \u201cwhether the criminal defendant produced that minimum threshold of evidence necessary to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case that would allow a jury to rationally conclude that the evidence supports the application of the legal theory desired.\u201d <em>Id. </em>There must be \u201csome evidence,\u201d to support each element of the defense\u2019s legal theory before the requested instruction is warranted. <em>Cantine v. State, </em>160 Md.App. 391, 411, 864 A.2d 226 (2004) (holding that a renunciation instruction for the crime of conspiracy was not warranted when \u201calthough the record provide[d] sparse evidence of [appellant\u2019s] involvement in the conspiracy ... there [was] no evidence of an affirmative withdrawal from the conspiracy\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>386 Md. 181, 872 A.2d 46 (2005); <em>Sutton v. State, </em>139 Md.App. 412, 428-29, 776 A.2d 47 (2001) (holding that a voluntary intoxication instruction was not warranted when \u201cno evidence was established at trial of any impairment of [appellant\u2019s] ability to form the specific intent to commit robbery at the time of the murder\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>\n<em>a. Necessity</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">Appellant requested that the circuit court instruct the jury-on the defense of necessity. The instruction appellant requested was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-6\">An act which would otherwise be a crime may be excused if the person accused can show that it was done only in order to avoid consequences which could not otherwise be avoided, and which, if they had followed, would have inflicted upon him, or upon others whom he was bound to protect, inevitable and irreparable evil; that no more was done than was reasonably necessary for that purpose; and that the evil inflicted by it was not disproportionate to the evil avoided.\u2122<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-7\">If you find that the Defendant acted out of necessity or out of duress of circumstances, then you must find the Defendant not guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-8\">FNl <em>Frasher v. State of Maryland, </em>8 Md.App. 439, 449[n. 6], [260 A.2d 656] (1970) (quoting <em>Stephen, Digest of the Criminal Law, </em>art. 32).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-9\">Appellant argues that the defense was applicable because he faced a choice between acting to prevent his wife from abusing drugs or doing nothing, \u201cthereby risking that his wife\u2019s placenta would break loose and she would bleed to death and/or that their child would die or be born with serious disabilities.\u201d The State counters that the defense was not applicable because \u201cthe crimes were disproportionate to the threat,\u201d and \u201cthe threatened harm is future, rather than immediate, personal injury.\u201d Furthermore, the State asserts that the defendant had other alternatives than resorting to violence, such as continuing to convince Burns to seek treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-10\">We begin with a discussion of the defense of necessity. The Court of Appeals held in <em>State v. Crawford, </em>308 Md. 683, 698-99, 521 A.2d 1193 (1987) (footnote omitted), that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"An\">necessity is a valid defense to the crime of unlawful possession of a handgun when five elements are present: (1) the defendant must be in present, imminent, and impending peril of death or serious bodily injury, or reasonably believe himself or others to be in such danger; (2) the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>must not have intentionally or recklessly placed himself in a situation in which it was probable that he would be forced to choose the criminal conduct; (3) the defendant must not have any reasonable, legal alternative to possessing the handgun; (4) the handgun must be made available to the defendant without preconceived design, and (5) the defendant must give up possession of the handgun as soon as the necessity or apparent necessity ends. We emphasize that if the threatened harm is property damage or future personal injury, the defense of necessity will not be viable; nor can the defense be asserted if the compulsion to possess the handgun arose directly from the defendant\u2019s own misconduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-5\">Similarly, this Court determined that</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-6\">a limited defense of necessity is available to an individual charged with the crime of escape if the following conditions exist:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-7\">\u2018(1) The prisoner is faced with a specific threat of death, forcible sexual attack or substantial bodily injury in the immediate future;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-8\">(2) There is no time for a complaint to the authorities or there exists a history of futile complaints which makes any result from such complaints illusory;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-9\">(3) There is no time or opportunity to resort to the courts;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-10\">(4) There is no evidence of force or violence used towards prison personnel or other \u2018innocent\u2019 persons in the escape; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-11\">(5) The prisoner immediately reports to the proper authorities when he has attained a position of safety from the immediate threat.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-12\"><em>Robinson v. State, </em>42 Md.App. 617, 621, 402 A.2d 115 (1979) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-13\">Maryland appellate courts have had only two occasions to address the defense of necessity outside the specific contexts of possession of a handgun and escape from prison. In <em>Frasher v. State, </em>this Court stated that \u201c[i]t is essential to a crime that the [appellant] committed a voluntary act,\u201d there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>fore, \u201cit is a defense as to all crimes except taking the life of an innocent person that the [appellant] acted under a compelling force of coercion or duress.\u201d <em>Frasher, </em>8 Md.App. at 447-48, 260 A.2d 656. This \u201ccompulsion may be by necessity, that is duress arising from circumstances, or by the application of duress on the defendant by another person.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 448, 260 A.2d 656. Quoting \u201cR. Perkins, <em>Criminal Law, </em>847 (1957),\u201d the <em>Frasher </em>Court stated: \u201c Tf a choice exists but only between two evils, one of which is the commission of a wrongful act, and the emergency was not created by the wrongful act of another person it is spoken of as an act done in a case of necessity.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 448, 260 A.2d 656. Judge Orth, writing for the Court, elaborated on the type of emergency contemplated by the defense:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-5\">[C]ourts have recognized necessity as an excuse where, for example, a person is unavoidably caught in a traffic jam, holding that he is not guilty of violating the law which prohibits stopping at that place; and a vessel is not hable for a violation of the embargo laws where, during a legitimate voyage, she is obliged by stress of weather to take refuge in a proscribed port.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-6\"><em>Id. </em>The <em>Frasher </em>Court determined that the defense did not apply to the facts of that case because \u201cin a prosecution for an offense not requiring intent, as are the offenses here [possession and control of heroin], the defense of necessity is not available, at least where the defendant could have avoided the emergency by taking advance precautions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 448-49, 260 A.2d 656.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">The Court of Appeals again considered the defense of necessity in <em>Sigma Reproductive Health Center v. State, </em>297 Md. 660, 675-76, 467 A.2d 488 (1983), stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-8\">\u201cOne who, under the pressure of circumstances, commits what would otherwise be a crime may be justified by \u2018necessity\u2019 in doing as he did and so not be guilty of the crime in question. With the defense of necessity, the pressure must come from the physical forces of nature (storms, privations) rather than from other human beings. (When the pressure is from human beings, the defense, if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>applicable, is called duress rather than necessity.) Also, the pressure must operate upon the mind of the defendant rather than upon his body. (When A and B are standing atop a precipice, and an earthquake causes A to stumble against B, throwing B over the cliff to his death, A\u2019s defense to a homicide charge is not that of necessity, for A\u2019s mind did not will his body against B\u2019s; instead, his defense is that he did no \u2018act\u2019 (a willed movement), and one cannot be guilty of a crime of action without an act.) But when A, starving to death, takes and eats B\u2019s food to save his own life, or when A in an emergency intentionally kills B to save C and D, he may be eligible for the defense of necessity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-4\">The rationale of the necessity defense is not that a person, when faced with the pressure of circumstances of nature, lacks the mental element which the crime in question requires. Rather, it is this reason of public policy: the law ought to promote the achievement of higher values at the expense of lesser values, and sometimes the greater good for society will be accomplished by violating the literal language of the criminal law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">(quoting W. LaFave <em>&amp; </em>A. Scott, Jr., <em>Criminal Law </em>\u00a7 50 (1972)).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">The Court noted five elements necessary to consider before applying the defense of necessity:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-7\">\u201c1 \u2014 The harm avoided \u2014 this need not be physical harm but also may be harm to property as, for instance, where a firefighter destroys some property to prevent the spread of fire which threatens to consume other property of greater value.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-8\">2 \u2014 The harm done \u2014 this is not limited to any particular type of harm but includes intentional homicide as well as intentional battery or property damage. An illustration is supplied:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-9\">\u2018[A]s where A, driving a car, suddenly finds himself in a predicament where he must either run down B or hit C\u2019s house and he reasonably chooses the latter, unfortunately killing two people in the house who by bad luck happened to be just at that place inside the house where A\u2019s car struck\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>it is the harm-reasonably-expected, rather than the harm-actually-caused, which governs.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-4\">3\u2014 Intention to avoid harm \u2014 to have the defense of necessity, the defendant must have acted with the intention of avoiding the greater harm. Actual necessity, without the intention, is not enough. However, an honest and reasonable belief in the necessity of his action is all that is required.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-5\">4\u2014 The relative value of the harm avoided and the harm done. The defendant\u2019s belief as to the relative harmfulness of the harm avoided and the harm done does not control. It is for the court, not the defendant, to weigh the relative harmfulness of the two alternatives. To allow the defense the court must conclude that the harm done by the defendant in choosing the one alternative was less than the harm which would have been done if he had chosen the other.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-6\">5\u2014 Optional courses of action; imminence of disaster. The defense of necessity applies when the defendant is faced with this choice of two evils: he may either do something which violates the literal terms of the criminal law and thus produce some harm, or not do it and so produce a greater harm. If, however, there is open to him a third alternative, which will cause less harm than will be caused by violating the law, he is not justified in violating the law. For example, \u201c[a] prisoner subjected to inhuman treatment by his jailors is not justified in breaking prison if he can bring about an improvement in conditions by other means.\u201d \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b158-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 678-79, 467 A.2d 483.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">Applying the law to the facts of that case, the Court concluded that Debra Braun was not acting in necessity when she criminally trespassed on the grounds of Sigma Reproductive Health Center to demonstrate against abortion because there were alternatives that would not have involved breaking the law.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 689-90, 467 A.2d 483. The Court held that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>\u201cnecessity is not a valid defense for criminal trespass charges involving political or moral protest, particularly those involving abortion clinics.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 681, 467 A.2d 483.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">The teachings from these cases makes clear that, in order for the defense of necessity to have been warranted in this case, appellant must have presented \u201csome evidence\u201d that there was a choice between two evils, that no legal alternatives existed, that the harm appellant caused was not disproportionate to the harm avoided, and that the emergency was imminent. <em>See id. </em>at 678-79, 467 A.2d 483; <em>Frasher, </em>8 Md.App. at 448, 260 A.2d 656. Appellant runs afoul of the last requirement, or namely, that the emergency he was seeking to prevent was imminent.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">Appellant testified, without corroboration, that he called a hospital the night of the incident and was told if Burns continued to use cocaine she might suffer internal bleeding from a ruptured placenta later during pregnancy, but there was no evidence of an immediate or imminent danger that would warrant appellant acting in the manner that he did. Rather than helping, his actions could have caused more serious harm to Burns and perhaps a miscarriage terminating her pregnancy.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> In addition, Lambert could have been more seriously injured or even killed. A tenuous relationship between present actions and a possible future harm is not enough to support a necessity instruction. <em>Sigma, </em>297 Md. at 688-90, 467 A.2d 483. Other jurisdictions have reached similar conclusions. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Kroncke, </em>459 F.2d 697, 701 (8th Cir.1972) (stating that the \u201cdefense of necessity applied only in emergency situations where the peril is instant and overwhelming\u201d and was not a defense to interfering with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>the Selective Service Act); <em>People v. Galambos, </em>104 Cal.App.4th 1147, 128 Cal.Rptr.2d 844, 855 (2002) (citations omitted) (holding that a \u201cdefendant is \u2018not entitled to a claim of duress or necessity [for harvesting marijuana] unless and until he demonstrates that, given the imminence of the threat, violation of [the law] was the only reasonable alternative\u2019 \u201d); <em>State v. Harrison, </em>473 N.W.2d 242, 244 (Iowa Ct.App.1991) (stating \u201cfears of future injuries do not excuse an offence [of driving while intoxicated]\u201d and \u201cthe necessity defense does not apply except in emergency situations where the threatened harm is immediate and the threatened disaster imminent\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">Appellant did not establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of necessity. Accordingly, the circuit court did not err in refusing to give a defense of necessity instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">\n<em>b. Mistake of Fact</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">Appellant contends that, \u201c[assuming that the lower court erred by failing to instruct the jury on necessity of circumstances, it further erred in denying [appellant\u2019s] request for an instruction on mistake of fact.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> He asserts that his belief in breaking into 17 Bay Street instead of 13 Bay Street to retrieve Burns was reasonable, \u201cgiven the information he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>had regarding her location as well as the general stress and excitement of the moment,\u201d and that \u201chad the address been correct, [his] actions would have been justified under the defense of necessity. Therefore, the refusal to provide the instruction on mistake of fact was error.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">In other words, he contends that, acting out of necessity, he could reasonably break into 13 Bay Street, and that he mistakenly entered 17 Bay Street, which was reasonable under the circumstances. A necessary element of the mistake of fact defense is that his conduct would not have amounted to a crime had the circumstances been as he believed them to be. Appellant\u2019s mistake of fact argument is based on his necessity defense and fails with the failure of that defense. Appellant was not justified in breaking into either 13 or 17 Bay Street.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">c. <em>Self-Defense</em></p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">Appellant asserts that \u201cLambert ran at him, cursing and holding an object in his hand. There was evidence from which the jury could have inferred that the object was a knife.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Not willing to take any chances, [appellant] hit [Lambert] once with the bat.\u201d He contends he acted in self-defense because he \u201cactually, and reasonably, believed that he was in immediate or imminent danger of bodily harm, he used no more force than was reasonably necessary to defend himself, and he was not the aggressor in the sense that he did not bring the bat with him with the intention of fighting anyone.\u201d The State counters that the defense is inapplicable because \u201c[appellant] was the first aggressor: he smashed through Lambert\u2019s door and entered Lambert\u2019s home carrying a bat.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">The requirements for self-defense are well established,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>(1) The accused must have had reasonable grounds to believe himself [or herself] in apparent imminent or immediate danger of death or serious bodily harm from his [or her] assailant or potential assailant;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-5\">(2) The accused must have in fact believed himself [or herself] in this danger;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-6\">(3) The accused claiming the right of self-defense must not have been the aggressor or provoked the conflict; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-7\">(4) The force used must have not been unreasonable and excessive, that is, the force must not have been more force than the exigency demanded.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b162-8\"><em>Roach, </em>358 Md. at 429-30, 749 A.2d 787 (citations omitted) (alterations in <em>Roach).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b162-9\">We have recognized that the perpetrator of a robbery has no right to defend himself, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-10\">The premise of an accused being permitted to raise the defense of self-defense to the charge of robbery borders on the absurd, and is a variation of the old shibboleth of the individual who murders both his parents and then throws himself on the mercy of the court as an orphan. We reject such reasoning by the \u201corphan\u201d in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b162-11\"><em>Sutton v. State, </em>139 Md.App. 412, 454, 776 A.2d 47 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-12\">Here, appellant admitted breaking into Lambert\u2019s apartment with a baseball bat. Although appellant may have only brought the bat to gain entrance to the apartment and not to physically injure anyone, he provoked the conflict by breaking into Lambert\u2019s home. It was Lambert, not appellant, who was entitled to defend himself. <em>Redcross v. State, </em>121 Md.App. 320, 328 n. 4, 708 A.2d 1154 (1998) (stating \u201ceven at the deadly force level ... there is no duty to retreat if one is attacked in his or her own home\u201d). Appellant clearly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>provoked the conflict and consequently, he cannot meet the third element of self-defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">Appellant also argues that he took the bat with him because \u201chis wife may have been in the company of violent individuals.\u201d We acknowledge that the privilege of self-defense is not necessarily forfeited by arming one\u2019s self in anticipation of an attack, but that right is qualified by the proviso that the right only extends to \u201cone who [was] not in any sense seeking an encounter.\u201d <em>Perry v. State, </em>234 Md. 48, 52, 197 A.2d 833 (1964); <em>see Marr v. State, </em>134 Md.App. 152, 183, 759 A.2d 327 (2000). Here, appellant provoked the encounter by breaking and entering into Lambert\u2019s apartment. The circuit court did not err in refusing to instruct the jury on self-defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">III. Voir Dire</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">Appellant proposed the following questions for <em>voir dire </em>that the circuit court declined to ask:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-8\">No. 11: Is there any member of the jury panel who feels as though simply because a charge is brought by a police officer and prosecuted by the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office the charge is probably correct and the Defendant is guilty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-9\">No. 12: Under the Constitution of the United States and the Maryland Law the burden remains throughout the trial on the State to convince you, the finders of fact, beyond a reasonable doubt that the Defendant is guilty? Would anyone have trouble complying with this?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-10\">No. 14: Is there anyone who thinks the Defendant should be required to prove his innocence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-11\">No. 15: If Defendant testifies, would you be able to weigh his testimony in the same manner as the testimony of other witnesses?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b163-12\">The circuit court did not ask questions 11, 12, and 14 because it believed that the jury instructions given at the close of all evidence would sufficiently cover the subject matter in question. With respect to question 15, the following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>THE COURT: I\u2019m not even sure, I\u2019m not sure I understand what that means.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-4\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: In other words not give it any more or less weight merely because he is the Defendant in the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-5\">THE COURT: You don\u2019t want them to give it just a little more?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-6\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Well, that would be great but I\u2019m hearing the flip side.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-7\">THE COURT: I think it\u2019s pretty neutral without giving it, it\u2019s going to end up being neutral if we do give it so I see nothing to be gained by it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">Appellant asserts that the circuit court erred in not asking questions based on a defendant\u2019s presumption of innocence and that \u201ca juror who could not accept this basic precept would be subject to being stricken for cause.\u201d Appellant recognizes that the Court of Appeals in <em>Twining v. State, </em>234 Md. 97, 100, 198 A.2d 291 (1964), held that it was inappropriate \u201cto question the jury [during <em>voir dire </em>] as to whether or not they would be disposed to follow or apply stated rules of law\u201d because they are \u201ccovered in subsequent instructions to the jury.\u201d He argues that <em>Twining </em>is outmoded because it \u201cwas decided at a time when juries were genuinely the judges of the law in Maryland and the [circuit] court\u2019s instructions were not binding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b164-9\">The State argues that \u201cthe principle that <em>[voir dire </em>] questions need not encompass matters that will be covered in the jury instructions is alive and well in Maryland.\u201d The State also contends that appellant acquiesced to the circuit court\u2019s rulings by \u201cnot disputing] the court\u2019s analysis, nor objecting] in any other way\u201d and by stating that the jury panel was acceptable.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-10\">\n<em>a. Acquiescence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b164-11\">Maryland Rule 4-323(c) governs the manner of objections during jury selection. <em>Baker v. State, </em>157 Md.App. 600, 609, 853 A.2d 796 (2004); <em>Newman v. State, </em>156 Md.App. 20, 50-51, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>845 A.2d 71 (2003), <em>reversed on other grounds, </em>384 Md. 285, 863 A.2d 321 (2004). The Rule provides, in pertinent part, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-5\">it is sufficient that a party, at the time the ruling or order is made or sought, makes known to the court the action that the party desires the court to take or the objection to the action of the court. The grounds for the objection need not be stated unless these rules expressly provide otherwise or the court so directs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">Md. Rule 4-323(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\"> We have held that it is sufficient to preserve an objection during the <em>voir dire </em>stage of trial simply by making known to the circuit court \u201cwhat [is] wanted done.\u201d <em>Baker, </em>157 Md.App. at 610, 853 A.2d 796. Here, after being asked if there were any problems with <em>voir dire, </em>appellant told the circuit court that he objected to his proposed questions 11, 12, 14, and 15 not being asked. Appellant was not required by Maryland Rule 4-323(e) to preserve the record in any other way. Moreover, accepting the jury that is ultimately selected after the circuit court has refused to propound requested <em>voir dire </em>questions does not constitute acquiescence to the previous adverse ruling. <em>Fowlkes v. State, </em>117 Md.App. 573, 580, 701 A.2d 862 (1997); <em>Ingoglia v. State, </em>102 Md.App. 659, 664, 651 A.2d 409 (1995). <em>Compare Gilchrist v. State, </em>340 Md. 606, 617, 667 A.2d 876 (1995) (stating that a claim of error in the inclusion or exclusion of a prospective juror or jurors \u201c \u2018is ordinarily abandoned when the defendant or his counsel indicates satisfaction with the jury at the conclusion of the jury selection process\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">\n<em>b. Jury Selection in this Case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b165-9\">The scope of <em>voir dire </em>and the form of the questions propounded rests firmly within the discretion of the circuit court. <em>Hill v. State, </em>339 Md. 275, 279, 661 A.2d 1164 (1995); <em>Davis v. State, </em>333 Md. 27, 34, 633 A.2d 867 (1993). The overriding purpose of <em>voir dire </em>is to ascertain the existence of cause for the disqualification of potential jurors. <em>Hill, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>339 Md. at 279, 661 A.2d 1164. The \u201cMaryland Declaration of Rights Article XXI guarantees a defendant the right to examine prospective jurors to determine\u201d whether cause for disqualification exists. <em>Bedford v. State, </em>317 Md. 659, 670, 566 A.2d 111 (1989). Failure to allow questions that may show cause for disqualification is an abuse of discretion constituting reversible error. <em>Casey v. Roman Catholic Archbishop, 217 </em>Md. 595, 605, 143 A.2d 627 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">We begin by stating that this Court has not, nor could it, retreat from <em>Twining. </em>We have consistently held that <em>voir dire </em>need not include matters that will be dealt with in the jury instructions. <em>Baker, </em>157 Md.App. at 616-17, 853 A.2d 796; <em>Bernadyn v. State, </em>152 Md.App. 255, 283, 831 A.2d 532 (2003), <em>cert. granted, </em>378 Md. 613, 837 A.2d 925 (2003); <em>Wilson v. State, </em>148 Md.App. 601, 656-67, 814 A.2d 1 (2002); <em>Carter v. State, </em>66 Md.App. 567, 576-77, 505 A.2d 545 (1986). As we have recently stated, \u201cit is up to the Court of Appeals, not this Court, to decide, as appellant suggests, that the reasoning of <em>Twining </em>is \u2018now outmoded.\u2019 \u201d <em>Baker, </em>157 Md. App. at 618, 853 A.2d 796. Accordingly, we perceive no abuse of discretion in the circuit court\u2019s failure to propound questions 11, 12, and 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">Appellant cites <em>Bowie v. State, </em>324 Md. 1, 595 A.2d 448 (1991), in support of his argument that it was an abuse of discretion not to propound question 15. In <em>Bowie, </em>the following three questions were requested by the defense: whether a juror believed a police officer would be likely to tell the truth; whether a juror would believe a police officer more than a civilian witness; and whether a juror would \u201ctend to view the testimony of witnesses called by the Defense with more skepticism than witnesses called by the State, merely because they were called by the Defense.\u201d <em>Bowie, </em>324 Md. at 6, 595 A.2d 448. The Court of Appeals observed that, \u201c[w]hile related, the three questions appellant requested were aimed at identifying two categories of venirepersons: (1) those who would believe police officers, simply because they were police officers, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>(2) those who would prefer the testimony of State\u2019s witnesses over defense witnesses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 7, 595 A.2d 448.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">Appellant\u2019s reliance on <em>Bowie </em>is misplaced because, here, the circuit court identified both categories of venirepersons when it asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-6\">Would any member of the prospective jury panel be inclined to give more weight or less weight to the testimony of a police officer or prosecution witness than to another witness merely because he or she is a police officer or a -witness for the prosecution? If so please stand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-7\">(Clerk records responses.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-8\">THE COURT: Is there anyone else who feels that they would give more weight or less weight to the testimony of a police officer or a witness for the prosecution than to another witness merely because he or she is a witness for the prosecution or police officer?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-9\">The present case is more like <em>Bernadyn v. State, </em>where we concluded that the circuit court was not required to ask a specific <em>voir dire </em>question regarding the weight the jury panel would give the defendant\u2019s testimony when it asked a more general question tailored toward ferreting out bias in favor of the State. <em>Bernadyn, </em>152 Md.App. at 283, 831 A.2d 532. In <em>Bernadyn </em>we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-10\">Appellant contends that the question regarding weight to be given to the testimony of a criminal defendant is similar to mandatory inquiries regarding the weight to be given to the testimony of police officers. Essentially, the question seeks to determine whether jurors would have a bias against appellant merely because he was accused of a crime and therefore give his testimony less weight than the testimony of other witnesses such as police officers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-11\">We first note that the court questioned the venire regarding biases in favor of or against the testimony of police officers. The issue was adequately addressed by the court. Second, the court asked the venire whether members would \u201ctend to view the witnesses called by the defense with more or less skepticism than witnesses called by the State[.]\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>The question is a broader version of that requested by appellant. The actual question posed to the venire would reveal not only bias towards appellant\u2019s testimony but also towards those witnesses testifying on appellant\u2019s behalf. Consequently, we find that the questions given by the court were sufficient to meet the mandatory requirements.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b168-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 283-284, 831 A.2d 532. <em>Accord, Baker, </em>157 Md.App. at 615, 853 A.2d 796 (finding no error in refusing to propound a question concerning the weight given to a defendant\u2019s testimony when the circuit court has already addressed whether the jurors would give more weight to the State\u2019s witnesses).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">We are persuaded that the question given in this case was sufficient because it was a \u201cbroader version\u201d of the question requested by appellant. Appellant\u2019s requested question was: \u201cIf Defendant testified, would you be able to weigh his testimony in the same manner as the testimony of other witnesses?\u201d The question asked by the circuit court included whether the potential juror would give more or less weight to \u201ca witness for the <em>prosecution than to another witness </em>merely because he or she\u201d was a witness for the prosecution. (Emphasis added). The question propounded by the circuit court would reveal not only bias in favor of the State, but also any bias against any defense witness, which would, of course, include appellant. It was not an abuse of discretion for the circuit court to forego asking question 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">IV. Merger</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">At sentencing, defense counsel suggested that \u201cperhaps the crime of malicious destruction of property would merge in the fourth degree burglary as the only destruction of property was the breaking, that was the necessary element of the fourth degree burglary.\u201d Relevant to this argument, the circuit court sentenced appellant as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-8\">Count 12, fourth degree burglary at 17 Bay Street: 3 years\u2019 incarceration;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-9\">Count 13, malicious destruction of property at 17 Bay Street: 60 days\u2019 incarceration consecutive to Count 12;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>Count 16, fourth degree burglary at 13 Bay Street: 3 years\u2019 incarceration consecutive to Count 13;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-4\">Count 18, malicious destruction of inside door at 13 Bay Street, merges with Count 16, fourth degree burglary at 13 Bay Street;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-5\">Count 17, malicious destruction of outside door at 13 Bay Street, 60 days\u2019 incarceration consecutive to Count 3 [second degree assault on Lambert] and restitution in the amount of $490.75.[<footnotemark>23</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">Appellant contends that the circuit court \u201capparently agreed\u201d that the sentences should merge because he, in fact, merged the sentence for malicious destruction of property of Lambert\u2019s apartment door with the fourth degree burglary conviction at that residence, but \u201cinexplicably imposed consecutive sentences for the remaining count of malicious destruction [of property] at 13 Bay Street as well as the count pertaining to 17 Bay Street.\u201d Appellant argues that \u201c[because the legislature may not intend that separate sentences be imposed for two offenses arising out of the same transaction, the rule of lenity requires that any doubt concerning legislative intent be resolved in favor of the defendant.\u201d He also asserts that \u201cfundamental fairness\u201d requires merger because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-7\">the elements of malicious destruction of property were integral to the burglary charges. Indeed, it is difficult to imagine any burglary in which there is not some concomitant destruction of property. By enacting separate statutes, the General Assembly clearly did not intend that the destruction of property incidental to a burglary be separately punished from the burglary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">The State responds that the two offenses \u201care plainly distinct\u201d and do not merge under the required elements tests. It also asserts that the offenses do not satisfy the rule of lenity because they \u201care not of necessity intertwined, nor is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>one necessarily the over[t] act of the other. They involve two separate kinds of injuries to the victim-an intrusion into the victim\u2019s dwelling and the destruction of the victim\u2019s property- and should therefore be punished separately.\u201d Finally, the State argues that principles of fundamental fairness do not apply because both offenses are statutory.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">\n<em>a. The Required Evidence Test</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">In Maryland, the required evidence test is usually used to determine whether two offenses arising out of the same act merge. <em>In re Michael W., </em>367 Md. 181, 186, 786 A.2d 684 (2001); <em>Williams v. State, </em>323 Md. 312, 316, 593 A.2d 671 (1991). The required evidence test, also known as the \u201csame evidence test,\u201d the \u201cBlockburger test,\u201d or the \u201celements test,\u201d applies equally to statutory and common law offenses. <em>Dixon v. State, </em>364 Md. 209, 237, 772 A.2d 283 (2001). The focus is on the \u201c \u2018elements of each offense; if all of the elements of one offense are included in the other offense, so that only the latter offense contains a distinct element or distinct elements, the former merges into the latter.\u2019 \u201d <em>Williams, </em>323 Md. at 317, 593 A.2d 671 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">The Court of Appeals has explained recently that, in the context of double jeopardy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-8\">\u201cThe required evidence test is that which is minimally necessary to secure a conviction for each ... offense. If each offense requires proof of a fact which the other does not, or in other words, if each offense contains an element which the other does not, the offenses are not the same for double jeopardy purposes even though arising from the same conduct or episode. But, where only one offense requires proof of an additional fact, so that all elements of one offense are present in the other, the offenses are deemed to be the same for double jeopardy purposes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aky\"><em>Anderson v. State, </em>385 Md. 123, 131, 867 A.2d 1040 (2005) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-9\">Appellant does not contend that the offenses merge under the required evidence test, and, indeed, this Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>explicitly held in <em>Christian v. State, </em>65 Md.App. 303, 308-09, 500 A.2d 341 (1985), <em>affirmed on other grounds, </em>309 Md. 114, 522 A.2d 945 (1987), that breaking and entering and malicious destruction of property do not merge under the required evidence test. We reasoned that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AvL\">[m]alicious destruction requires proof that the accused had a specific intent to destroy, injure, deface or molest the real or personal property of another. The crime of breaking and entering requires proof of the accused\u2019s specific intent to break and enter the dwelling house of another. Clearly, the intent to break and enter is different from an intent to destroy, injure, deface or molest the property of another.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 308-09, 500 A.2d 341.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">\n<em>b. The Rule of Lenity</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">The required evidence test is the threshold standard for determining when two offenses merge, but, in addition,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-8\">we have applied as a principle of statutory construction the \u201crule of lenity,\u201d which \u201cprovides that doubt or ambiguity as to whether the legislature intended that there be multiple punishments for the same act or transaction\u201d will be resolved against turning a single transaction into multiple offenses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-9\"><em>Williams, </em>323 Md. at 321, 593 A.2d 671 (citations omitted). The rule of lenity applies where the required evidence test \u201c \u2018might not be adequate to afford the protection against undue harassment embodied in the purpose of the prohibition against double jeopardy.\u2019 \u201d <em>Brooks v. State, </em>284 Md. 416, 423, 397 A.2d 596 (1979) (quoting <em>Cousins v. State, </em>277 Md. 383, 397, 354 A.2d 825 (1976)). \u201c[I]f we are unsure of the legislative intent in punishing offenses as a single merged crime or as distinct offenses, we, in effect, give the defendant the benefit of the doubt and hold that the crimes do merge.\u201d <em>Monoker v. State, </em>321 Md. 214, 222, 582 A.2d 525 (1990). The relevant inquiry when applying the rule of lenity is \u201cwhether the two offenses are \u2018of necessity closely intertwined\u2019 or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>whether one offense is <em>\u2018necessarily </em>the overt act\u2019 of the other.\u201d <em>Pineta v. State, </em>98 Md.App. 614, 620-21, 634 A.2d 982 (1993) (quoting <em>Dillsworth v. State, </em>308 Md. 354, 366-67, 519 A.2d 1269 (1987)) (emphasis in <em>Pineta). </em>\u201cAs it is a principle of statutory construction, the rule of lenity applies where both offenses are statutory in nature or where one offense is statutory and the other is a derivative of common law.\u201d <em>Khalifa v. State, </em>382 Md. 400, 434, 855 A.2d 1175 (2004).<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">The original fourth degree burglary statute was enacted by the General Assembly through Chapter 661 of the Laws of 1973.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> In <em>Herd v. State, </em>125 Md.App. 77, 87, 724 A.2d 693 (1999), we discussed the legislative history of fourth degree burglary, noting:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>The motivation for the new 1973 statute was the desire of the State\u2019s Attorneys of Maryland to have a lesser crime they could tactically fall back on in instances where they could readily prove the <em>actus reus </em>of breaking and entering but encountered difficulties of proof when it came to the <em>mens rea </em>of a particular specific intent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b173-4\">Judge Bloom explained in <em>Bane v. State, </em>73 Md.App. 135, 148-49, 533 A.2d 309 (1987),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-5\">In 1973, the Maryland Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee received testimony from the State\u2019s Attorneys of various counties and Baltimore City that there was a need for a burglary offense of less severity than common law burglary or any of the then applicable statutory burglary-type crimes. The existence of such an offense, it was argued, would facilitate prosecutors in the handling of cases in which the felonious intent, a required element of common law burglary and all of the then statutory burglary offenses, of the intruder could not be clearly shown. Senate Bill 218 was drafted and submitted to the 1973 General Session with the intent of creating a criminal offense to comply with the State\u2019s Attorneys\u2019 wishes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">Furthermore,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-7\">The gravamen of the offense is the breaking and entering of the dwelling of another. To be convicted of statutory breaking and entering, as is evident from the legislative intent of the bill, no intent to commit a felony or to steal personal property need be shown. The misdemeanor crime of statutory breaking and entering, therefore, is a nebulous one as it relates to the intent of the perpetrator, since no showing of any particular intent is required ... All that must be shown is that the perpetrator broke and entered a dwelling place of another.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b173-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 149-50, 533 A.2d 309 (internal citations omitted). It is apparent that the General Assembly enacted fourth degree burglary to punish the <em>actus reus </em>of \u201cbreaking and entering the dwelling house of another\u201d without regard to <em>mens rea, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>save that the violator must know the invasion is unauthorized. <em>Dabney, </em>159 Md.App. at 237, 858 A.2d 1084.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">Malicious destruction of property, however, at common law and as codified by the General Assembly, is a specific intent crime, which \u201crequires both a deliberate intention to injure the property of another and malice.\u201d <em>Shell v. State, </em>307 Md. 46, 68, 512 A.2d 358 (1986). \u201cIn other words, it is not sufficient that the defendant merely intended to do the act which led to the damage to property; it is necessary that the defendant actually intended to cause the harm to the property of another.\u201d <em>In re Taka C., </em>331 Md. 80, 84, 626 A.2d 366 (1993). Malicious destruction of property for damage less than $500, the crime that appellant was charged with three times, carries a punishment of \u201cimprisonment not exceeding 60 days or a fine not exceeding $500 or both.\u201d C.L. \u00a7 6-301.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">We do not find any ambiguity or other indication that the General Assembly did not intend separate punishments for fourth degree burglary and malicious destruction of property. Accordingly, the two offenses do not necessarily merge under the rule of lenity.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">Nevertheless, \u201c[o]ne of the most basic considerations in all our decisions is the principle of fundamental fairness in meting out punishment for a crime.\u201d <em>Monoker, </em>321 Md. at 223, 582 A.2d 525 (reasoning that, \u201cbecause the solicitation was part and parcel of the ultimate conspiracy and thereby an integral component of it, it would be fundamentally unfair ... for us to require [appellant] to suffer twice\u201d). We disagree with the State\u2019s assertion that the principles of fundamental fairness are inapplicable to the present case because both offenses are statutory. Rather, the concept of \u201cfairness\u201d permeates all of our decisions regardless of whether the offenses arise from common law or are purely statutory. <em>Williams v. State, </em>323 Md. at 324, 593 A.2d 671; <em>Claggett v. State, </em>108 Md.App. 32, 53-54, 670 A.2d 1002 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">Under the facts of the present case, the malicious destruction of property was clearly incidental to the breaking and entering of 13 and 17 Bay Street. Thus, we are persuad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>ed that Count 13, malicious destruction of property at 17 Bay Street, should have been merged into Count 12, the burglary conviction at that address; and that Count 17, the malicious destruction of property at 13 Bay Street, should have been merged into Count 16, the burglary conviction at that address.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">SENTENCES FOR MALICIOUS DESTRUCTION OF PROPERTY VACATED; JUDGMENTS AFFIRMED IN ALL OTHER RESPECTS.

Mistake of fact is a defense and you are required to find the defendant not guilty if all of the following three factors are present:</p>\n<p id=\"b160-10\">(1) the defendant actually believed (alleged mistake);</p>\n<p id=\"b160-11\">(2) the defendant's belief and actions were reasonable under the circumstances; and</p>\n<p id=\"b160-12\">(3) the defendant did not intend to commit the crime of (crime) and the defendant\u2019s conduct would not have amounted to the crime of (crime) if the mistaken belief had been correct, meaning that, if the true facts were what the defendant thought them to be, the [defendant's conduct would not have been criminal] [defendant would have the defense of (defense)].</p>\n<p id=\"b160-13\">In order to convict the defendant, the State must show that the mistake of fact defense does not apply in this case by proving, beyond a reasonable doubt, that at least one of the three factors previously stated was absent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b161-9\">.

Maryland recognizes both perfect and imperfect self-defense. <em>State v. Smullen, </em>380 Md. 233, 251, 844 A.2d 429 (2004). Perfect self-defense occurs when the belief of danger is subjectively held by the accused and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>is objectively reasonable, while imperfect self-defense occurs when the actual subjective belief on the part of the accused is not objectively reasonable. <em>Id. </em>A common element to both forms of self-defense is that the accused \"must not have been the aggressor or provoked the conflict.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 269, 844 A.2d 429.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b169-9\">. We note that, although the circuit court\u2019s language indicates that restitution was only imposed for Count 17, the actual amount awarded appears to include both Counts 17 and 18.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b172-6\">. Fourth degree burglary, codified at Maryland Code (2002) \u00a7 6-205 of the Criminal Law Article (\"C.L.\u201d), is a statutory offense that embraces four sub-varieties of criminal behavior. <em>Dabney v. State, </em>159 Md.App. 225, 235, 858 A.2d 1084 (2004). C.L. \u00a7 6-205 provides:</p>\n<p id=\"A9z\">(a) Prohibited \u2014 Breaking and entering dwelling.' \u2014 A person may not break and enter the dwelling of another.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">(b) Same \u2014 Breaking and entering storehouse. \u2014 A person may not break and enter the storehouse of another.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-9\">(c) Same \u2014 Being in or on dwelling, storehouse, or environs. \u2014 A person, with the intent to commit theft, may not be in or on:</p>\n<p id=\"b172-10\">(1) the dwelling or storehouse of another; or</p>\n<p id=\"b172-11\">(2) a yard, garden, or other area belonging to the dwelling or storehouse of another.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-12\">(d) Same \u2014 Possession of burglar\u2019s tool. \u2014 A person may not possess a burglar's tool with the intent to use or allow the use of the burglar's tool in the commission of a violation of this subtitle.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-13\">Subsection (a) and (b), are general intent crimes, and, as such, are \"recent statutory inventions, whereas [subsection (c) and (d)] were already venerable at the time of Blackstone and Hale.\u201d <em>Dabney, </em>159 Md.App. at 235, 858 A.2d 1084. Appellant was charged pursuant to C.L. \u00a7 6-205(a) and (b), and it is these subsections that we refer to in our discussion. Malicious destruction of property is a common law offense that has been codified \"so that for many purposes it is treated as two separate crimes based upon the value of the property destroyed.\u201d <em>Spratt v. State, </em>315 Md. 680, 681, 556 A.2d 667 (1989).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b172-14\">. At that time, the statute read: \u201cAny person who breaks and enters the dwelling house of another is guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be sentenced to imprisonment for a term of not more than three (3) years or a fine of not more than five hundred dollars ($500.00) or both.\u201d It is now codified at C.L. \u00a7 6-205(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b175-14\">. The circuit court merged Count 18, the malicious destruction of property of the inside door at 13 Bay Street, into Count 16, the burglary conviction at that address. We do not perceive any difference in the malicious destruction of the inside door versus the outside door that occurred at that address. Therefore, we do not disturb that sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
