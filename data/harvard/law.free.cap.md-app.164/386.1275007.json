Enacted primarily to prevent insurance purchasers from losing their coverage when their agent and their company parted ways, this legislation transfers, when that occurs, ownership of the information contained in the agent\u2019s book of business to the insurer and then requires the insurer to renew all policies produced by the agent. To off-set the agent\u2019s loss of his \u201cexpirations,\u201d it further requires the insurer, under \u00a7 27-503(b)(2), to provide the agent -with 90 days\u2019 notice of termination and then, under \u00a7 27-503(b)(3), to renew the agent\u2019s policies, through him or her, for at least two years or until the policies are placed elsewhere. Because the purpose of subsection (2) of \u00a7 27-503(b) is to provide the agent with adequate notice of termination and that of subsection (3) is to ensure policy renewal, they are known respectively as the \u201cnotice rule\u201d and the \u201crenewal rule.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b410-9\">These rules do not apply, however, when the insurance producer is a \u201ccaptive agent,\u201d that is, an agent who works exclusively for a company or group of companies, whose termination will not interfere with the renewal of any of the policies of his customers, and whose book of business is owned by that entity. As there is no dispute that appellant David B. Metz worked exclusively for appellee Allstate Insurance Company and that the termination of his agreement did not imperil his customers\u2019 policies with Allstate, the only issue before us is whether he or Allstate owned his book of business. If he did, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>then he was entitled to the protections afforded by the notice and renewal rules; if he did not, then he fell within the \u201ccaptive agent\u201d exception to the applicability of those two prophylactic provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">Determining who owned Metz\u2019s expirations is no mean task. Under his contract with Allstate, Metz was professionally neither fish nor fowl, that is to say, neither \u201ccaptive\u201d nor \u201cindependent\u201d agent, but a combination of both. He was one of Allstate\u2019s \u201cexclusive independent agents,\u201d a company designation which conveys the paradoxical nature of his position. As a \u201cexclusive independent agent,\u201d he was both an independent contractor and an exclusive agent, traditionally incompatible positions. He did not \u201cown\u201d his book of business, according to Allstate; yet he had an undefined \u201ceconomic interest\u201d in it, which he could sell to a buyer approved by Allstate or pledge as collateral for a loan. Indeed, given the novelty and complexity of the parties\u2019 business arrangement, it is understandable that the Insurance Commissioner and the circuit court came to different conclusions as to who owned Metz\u2019s expirations for purposes of \u00a7\u00a7 27 \u2014 503(b)(2) and (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">The Insurance Commissioner accepted Metz\u2019s claim that he owned his expirations; the Circuit Court for Baltimore City did not. Reversing the Commissioner\u2019s decision, the circuit court declared that, under the parties\u2019 agreement, the expirations clearly belonged to Allstate and that Metz was therefore not entitled to the statutory benefits he claimed. That ruling was erroneous, claims Metz and the Insurance Commissioner, both of whom are appellants in this matter. Together, they request that we reverse it and remand this case to the circuit court with instructions that it affirm the Commissioner\u2019s decision. Individually, Metz requests that further proceedings be held to determine the appropriate amount of damages due him, as a result of Allstate\u2019s purported violation of the notice and renewal rules. We decline to grant either request.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">Metz\u2019s relationship with Allstate began many years before he became one of Allstate\u2019s \u201cexclusive independent agents.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>In May 1986, Metz joined Allstate, signing an \u201cAgent Employment Agreement.\u201d Under that agreement, Metz became a \u201cfull-time employee\u201d of Allstate and received a monthly minimum salary and \u201cemployment benefits.\u201d That agreement also provided, among other things, that Allstate would designate a \u201csales location\u201d for Metz, determine \u201call matters relating to its business and [its] operation,\u201d and \u201cown all business produced under the terms of the Agreement.\u201d It declared that, as an employee, Metz had \u201cno vested interest\u201d in any of the business he might develop on behalf of Allstate.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">Almost a decade and half later, to remain competitive, Allstate chose to end its practice of using employees as agents and rely, instead, as its competitors were purportedly doing, on independent agents.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For that purpose, it developed an agreement it called the \u201cAllstate R3001S Exclusive Agency Agreement\u201d (\u201cR3001 Agreement\u201d). In July of 2000, Metz signed a copy of that agreement, which incorporated by reference the \u201cSupplement for the R3001 Agreement,\u201d Allstate\u2019s \u201cExclusive Agency Independent Contractor Manual,\u201d and the \u201cAllstate Agency Standards.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">The R3001 Agreement stated, among things, that Metz was now an \u201cindependent contractor for all purposes and not an employee,\u201d that his \u201csole compensation\u201d would be commissions, that he would be responsible for running his own agency, including hiring and firing his own employees, setting their salaries, and so on. It also stated that he would have an \u201ceconomic interest\u201d in his \u201cAllstate customer accounts,\u201d which he could pledge as collateral for a loan or sell to an Allstate-approved buyer upon the termination of his relationship with Allstate.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">As to who owned the business generated by his agency, the agreement was emphatic, declaring at least three times in nine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>pages, that Allstate owned all of the business produced byMetz for Allstate. And that fact was reiterated in the Allstate manual that accompanied the agreement. The first paragraph of the R3001S Agreement stated that \u201c[t]he Company will own all business produced under the terms of th[e] Agreement\u201d; later, it provided all confidential information including \u201cthe names, addresses, and ages of policyholders of the Company; types of policies; amounts of insurance; premium amounts; the description and location of insured property; [and] the expiration or renewal dates of policies ...\u201d are \u201cwholly owned by the Company.\u201d And, still later, it stated that \u201c[a]ny confidential information ... recorded on paper, electronic data file, or any other medium, whether provided by the Company or by [the agent], is the exclusive property of the Company as is any such medium and any copy of such medium.\u201d Moreover, the first paragraph on the first page of The Exclusive Agency Independent Contractor Manual avowed: Allstate \u201cowns all business produced by [its agents].\u201d And consistent with these assertions of Allstate\u2019s ownership, the Agreement prohibited Metz from disclosing any \u201cconfidential information\u201d to a third party without Allstate\u2019s consent and from using that information for a period of one year, following the termination of the Agreement, to solicit the customers he had produced for Allstate.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">Less than two years after signing the R3001 Agreement, in a letter dated February 5, 2002, Allstate terminated it, effective June 1, 2002, because of Metz\u2019s \u201ccontinued failure to comply with Allstate Agency Operations Standards.\u201d The letter stated that \u201cAllstate w[ould] immediately assume full responsibility for servicing [Metz\u2019s] book of business.....\u201d It advised Metz that he had \u201cthe option of accepting a termination payment from Allstate or selling [his] economic interest in [his] entire book of business to an approved buyer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b413-8\">After receiving Allstate\u2019s letter, Metz filed a complaint with the Maryland Insurance Administration (\u201cMIA\u201d). The allegations of that complaint were summarized in the Insurance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>Commissioner\u2019s Memorandum of Law and Final order.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> According to the Insurance Commissioner, Metz \u201calleged that: (1) Allstate had unlawfully cancelled its agency agreement with [him]: (2) Allstate [had] unlawfully failed to provide [him] with two years of his customers\u2019 policy renewal; and, (3) that Allstate [had] unlawfully prohibited [him] from soliciting, submitting application/or binding policies to Allstate for ninety days following the day that Allstate cancelled its agency agreement with [him].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">At the time he filed his complaint, Metz entered negotiations with his brother, another Allstate agent, to sell his business, including his expirations, to his brother\u2019s agency, the \u201cWilliam P. Metz Insurance Agency.\u201d Even though he terminated those negotiations after receiving a favorable ruling from the Associate Insurance Commissioner of Property &amp; Casualty (\u201cassociate commissioner\u201d), he nonetheless instructed Allstate to transfer all of his accounts, including the revenue stream, to his brother\u2019s agency. Indeed, According to the Insurance Commissioner, Metz\u2019s brother received commissions totaling $28,000 for the months of June, July, August, September, and October, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">Although the associate insurance commissioner concluded that Metz\u2019s termination was not \u201carbitrary, capricious [or] unfair,\u201d he ruled that Allstate and Metz \u201cjointly owned the \u2018business\u2019 produced under the Agreement.\u201d He therefore ordered Allstate \u201cto renew through Mr. Metz any policies that have not been replaced by Mr. Metz with other insurers as the expirations occur for a period of two (2) years from the termination date of Mr. Metz\u2019s Agreement with Allstate\u201d and \u201cto rescind its February 5, 2002 cancellation notice; and, if it still chooses to cancel Mr. Metz\u2019s Agreement, to issue a new notice providing ninety (90) days in which Mr. Metz may solicit, submit applications, or bind policies for Allstate.\u201d The parties were notified that that order would become final if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>neither party requested a review hearing within thirty days of its filing date. Both sides did.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">At the conclusion of that hearing, the Insurance Commissioner <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> found, as the associate commissioner had, that Metz\u2019s termination was not arbitrary, capricious, or unfair. He also agreed with the associate commissioner that Allstate was not the sole owner of the expirations and that, as a result, Allstate had violated Maryland law \u201cby failing to provide Metz with two years\u2019 renewal policy expirations and by ... failing to accept new or renewal business from Metz for ninety (90) days after [its] notice of cancellation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">He further found that \u201cno where in the. Allstate Agency Agreement does the term expiration appear\u201d; that \u201cthe Allstate R3001S Agreement granted Metz more than the right to receive commissions from Allstate\u201d; that Metz was required to maintain a profitable book of business; that the agreement \u201crepeatedly [makes references] to the ownership interest of the R3001 Agent as \u2018your business\u2019 or refers to the sale of \u2018your agency,\u2019 or the sale of the agent\u2019s \u2018book of business\u2019 \u201d; that \u201cAllstate does not assist in the valuation or the'sale of the agent\u2019s interest in his business\u201d; that \u201cthe terms of any sale are negotiated between the buying and selling agents\u201d; and that an agent\u2019s interest may be pledged as collateral for a loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">Although he made many of the same findings as the associate commissioner, the Insurance Commissioner granted Metz different relief: He ordered Allstate to pay restitution to Metz in the amount of the commissions due on policy renewals for a period of two years from the termination of Metz\u2019s agency agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">Mutually dissatisfied with that order, the parties filed cross-petitions for judicial review in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. While Metz claimed that the Insurance Commissioner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>erred in \u201cfailing to order Allstate to reinstate [him] as an Allstate agent for ninety (90) days and to \u2018renew\u2019 insurance policies through [him] for two (2) years[,]\u201d Allstate alleged that he erred in finding that Allstate had violated Maryland law and in ordering restitution. The circuit court agreed with Allstate and reversed the Insurance Commissioner\u2019s decision to the extent it found that Allstate had violated Maryland law, specifically \u00a7\u00a7 27-503(b)(2) and (3), in terminating Metz\u2019s agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">The circuit court explained that the R3001 Agreement\u2019s references to \u201cconfidential information\u201d were actually references to what are known, in the insurance business, as \u201cexpirations\u201d and that information, the Agreement repeatedly avowed, was the property of Allstate. And there were more indicia of Allstate\u2019s ownership, the court asserted, pointing specifically to the non-disclosure and the non-competition provisions of the agreement. Under the former, Metz was prohibited from disclosing any information regarding the business he generated for Allstate to a third party without Allstate\u2019s approval, and, under the latter, he was prohibited from soliciting Allstate\u2019s customers, including those he had produced for Allstate, for a period of one year following his termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">The circuit court dismissed Metz\u2019s claim that his \u201ceconomic interest\u201d in his book of business constituted ownership under \u00a7 27-503(b)(ii)(2), stating that \u201c[although Metz had an \u2018economic interest\u2019 in the book of business written under the Agreement, Allstate clearly owned the book of business, or the expirations.\u201d It further observed that, although Metz could transfer this information to a buyer, such a transfer could only occur with Allstate\u2019s approval and then only if the transferee agreed to be bound by the provisions of Metz\u2019s contract. \u201c[J]ust because the contract provided that Metz could use and transfer his right to use the expirations to another producer, Allstate did not,\u201d the court opined, \u201close ownership of the expirations.\u201d That information, the court declared, was \u201cat all times ... wholly owned by Allstate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b417-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">Appellants contend that the circuit court erred in reversing the Maryland Insurance Commissioner\u2019s finding that Allstate violated \u00a7 27-503 of the Insurance Article, when it failed to comply with the \u201cnotice\u201d and \u201crenewal\u201d rules of that statute in terminating Metz\u2019s contract. Compliance with those rules is required when the agent to be terminated owns his expirations; when he does not, he falls within the captive agent exception of that statute and no such compliance is necessary. Were it otherwise, the insurer would, in effect, be required by law to compensate a former agent for expirations that it, not he, owns.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">Finding that Allstate, not Metz, owned the \u201cexpirations,\u201d the circuit court held that Allstate was not required to give Metz 90 days\u2019 notice of his termination, under the \u201cnotice rule\u201d of \u00a7 27-503(b)(2), or to renew policies that Metz was unable to place with other companies, under the \u201crenewal rule\u201d of \u00a7 27-503(b)(3). It therefore reversed the decision of the Insurance Commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">But it is not the circuit court\u2019s decision that we review. It is the agency\u2019s. <em>Annapolis Mkt. Place, L.L.C. v. Parker, </em>369 Md. 689, 703, 802 A.2d 1029 (2002) (citation omitted) In so doing, our role \u201c \u2018is limited to determining if there is substantial evidence in the record as a whole to support the agency\u2019s findings and conclusions, and ... if the administrative decision is premised upon an erroneous conclusion of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bd. of Physician Quality Assurance v. Banks, </em>354 Md. 59, 67-68, 729 A.2d 376 (1999)(quoting <em>United, Parcel v. People\u2019s Counsel, </em>336 Md. 569, 576, 650 A.2d 226 (1994)). Applying that standard, we turn to appellants\u2019 contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-9\">Appellants assert that Allstate did not exclusively own Metz\u2019s expirations, but shared ownership with Metz. Metz\u2019s agreement with Allstate, they point out, granted Metz an \u201ceconomic interest\u201d in his \u201cbook of business,\u201d which he could either sell to an Allstate-approved buyer or accept a termi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>nation fee from Allstate, based upon the value of the expirations. That arrangement, they claim, made Metz and Allstate co-owners of the expirations, placing Metz within the protective scope of the notice and renewal rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">Section \u00a7 27-503(b)(2) or the \u201cnotice rule\u201d states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-6\">If an insurer intends to cancel a written agreement with an insurance producer or intends to refuse a class of renewal business from an insurance producer, the insurer shall give the insurance producer at least 90 days\u2019 written notice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">Md.Code (1957, 2002 Repl. Vol), \u00a7 27-503(b)(2) of the Insurance Article (\u201cIns.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">And Section 27-503(b)(3) or the \u201crenewal rule\u201d provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-9\">Notwithstanding any provision of the agreement to the contrary, the insurer shall continue for at least 2 years after termination of the agency agreement to renew through the insurance producer any of the policies that have not been replaced with other insurers as expirations occur.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-10\">Ins. \u00a7 27-503(b)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-11\">Thus, those two rules require an insurer to give an agent, which it wishes to terminate, 90 days written notice of that termination, and then, upon termination, to renew for at least two years, through that agent, any policies that have not been placed with other insurers. There are, however, two exceptions to the 90 day notice obligation of \u00a7 27-503(b)(2) and the two year renewal requirement of Ins. \u00a7 27 \u2014 503(b)(3), which relieve the insurer of having to comply with either. They are the \u201clines of business exception\u201d and the \u201ccaptive agent exception.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b418-12\">The lines of business exception provides that the notice and renewal rules do not pertain to \u201cpolicies of life insurance, health insurance, surety insurance, wet marine and transportation insurance, and title insurancef.]\u201d Ins. \u00a7 27 \u2014 503(b)(i)(l). That exception does not apply here, nor do the parties contend otherwise. The policies Metz wrote were for property and casualty insurance, not \u201cfor life insurance, health insurance, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>surety insurance, wet marine and transportation insurance, and title insurance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">But the applicability of the captive agent exception cannot be so easily dismissed. Indeed, that exception is the fulcrum of this case. It provides that the notice and renewal rules do not apply to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-6\">(ii) insurance producers or policies of a company or group of companies represented by insurance producers who by contractual agreement represent only that company or group of companies if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-7\">1. the business is owned by the company or group of companies; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-8\">2. the cancellation of any contractual agreement does not result in the cancellation or refusal to renew any policies.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-9\">Ins. \u00a7 27-503(b)(l)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-10\">The parties agree that the nature of Metz\u2019s agency satisfied two of the three criteria of the captive agent exception: Metz \u201cby contractual agreement represented only\u201d Allstate, as required by Ins. \u00a7 27-503(b)(l)(ii), and the \u201ccancellation of [Metz\u2019s] contractual agreement d[id] not result in the cancellation or refusal to renew any policies,\u201d as required by Ins. \u00a7 27-503(b)(l)(ii)(2). Thus, in determining whether the captive agent exception applies here, the only question that remains is whether \u201cthe business [was] owned\u201d by Allstate, as required by \u00a7 27-503(b)(l)(ii)(l). If Allstate did own the business, then Metz was not entitled to the protections afforded by the notice and renewal rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-11\">Neither \u00a7 27-503, in particular, nor the Insurance Article, in general, provides any guidance as to what the words \u201cbusiness\u201d and \u201cown\u201d mean in the phrase \u201cthe business is owned by the company.\u201d Fortunately, the Court of Appeals does, at least as to the meaning of \u201cbusiness.\u201d The term \u201cbusiness,\u201d the Court has indicated, refers to the agent\u2019s \u201cexpirations.\u201d <em>Lincoln Nat\u2019l Life Ins. Co. v. Ins. Comm\u2019r, </em>328 Md. 65, 76, 612 A.2d 1301 (1992). And the term \u201cexpirations\u201d refers to the \u201c \u2018records containing the date of the insurance policy, the name of the insured, the date of its expiration, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>amount of insurance premiums, property covered and terms of insurance.\u2019 \u201d <em>Travelers Indem. Co. v. Merling, </em>326 Md. 329, 337, 605 A.2d 83 (1992) (quoting <em>V.L. Phillips &amp; Co. v. Pennsylvania Threshermen, Etc., </em>199 F.2d 244, 246 (4th Cir. 1952)). Indeed, expirations provide an insurance agent or company with the information needed to contact an insured prior to termination of a policy and offer an opportunity to renew the policy. <em>Merling, </em>326 Md. at 337, 605 A.2d 83.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">Given this definition of expirations, the circuit court did not err, as appellants contend, in finding that the \u201cconfidential information\u201d mentioned in the R3001 Agreement referred to Metz\u2019s \u201cexpirations.\u201d The R3001 Agreement stated that \u201c[confidential information includes, but is not limited to: ... information regarding the names, addresses, and ages of policyholders of the Company; types of policies, amounts of insurance; premium amounts; the description and location of the insured property; the <em>expiration or renewal dates of policies </em>.... \u201d Consequently, as the circuit court observed, \u201c[a] comparison of the definition of \u2018confidential information\u2019 under the agreement and \u2018expirations\u2019 as defined by the Court of Appeals in <em>Merling </em>makes clear that they are the same.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">In the absence of a contractual provision attributing ownership of the expirations to one party or the other, this asset, under a trade custom and practice known as the \u201cAmerican Agency System,\u201d belonged to the agent. <em>Merling, </em>326 Md. at 337-38, 605 A.2d 83. In accordance with that custom and practice, \u201cif an insurance company terminated an agent, the company was prohibited from interfering with the agent\u2019s property right in the expirations. This meant that the company could not use the expirations to directly solicit the insureds or to refer them to other agents who represented the [same] company.\u201d <em>Merling, </em>326 Md. at 338, 605 A.2d 83. Unfortunately, \u201c[t]he result was that, upon termination of the agent, a majority of the policies which originated from the agent were not renewed.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">But this was hardly the only problem generated by a strict application of the American Agency System. It permitted, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>at least did not prevent, insurers from engaging in arbitrary and discriminatory practices such as \u201c \u2018redlining\u2019, whereby insurers would refuse to renew or write policies based on the geographic area in which the insureds or applicants lived.\u201d <em>Merling, </em>326 Md. at 339, 605 A.2d 83. Because, under the American Agency System, the expirations were exclusively the agent\u2019s, the insurer could rid itself of less economically rewarding business, by simply terminating its relationship with the representing agent, leaving its former insureds unprotected when their policies expired. <em>See Id. </em>at 340, 605 A.2d 83.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">That led to a series of enactments beginning in 1970, which, in effect, amended the American Agency System by transferring an ownership interest in the agent\u2019s expirations to the insurer, by requiring the insurer to renew the policies of the agent\u2019s customers and by providing the agent, in return, the opportunity to, among other things, place his customers with other insurers and collect commissions, for two years, on policies of customers he could not. In sum, these enactments were intended to protect both the insureds and their agents from arbitrary, capricious, or discriminatory practices of the insurer. <em>Id. </em>at 340, 605 A.2d 83.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">The Court of Appeals described the first legislative change in 1970 and the reasons for it as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-7\">By Ch. 417 of the Acts of 1970, the General Assembly added \u00a7\u00a7 234A, 234B and 234C to the Insurance Code, Art. 48A. Section 234A was enacted to prohibit insurance companies from engaging in numerous underwriting practices deemed arbitrary or discriminatory, including the practice of what is called \u201credlining,\u201d... Section 234A, inter alia, required insurers to renew existing policies unless the insurers could demonstrate certain economic or business reasons for the refusal to renew. Section 234B protected insurance agents from arbitrary or discriminatory termination by insurers. Section 234C granted to the Insurance Commissioner the power to order an insurance company either to accept the risk of an insured or the business from an agent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>if the Commissioner finds a violation of either \u00a7 234A or \u00a7 234B.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b422-4\"><em>Merling, </em>326 Md. at 339-40, 605 A.2d 83.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">Those legislative changes did not, however, fully achieve their purpose. The American Agency System still prevented insurance companies from using the expirations of a terminated agent to renew the policies of insureds. <em>Id. </em>at 340, 605 A.2d 83. That prohibition meant that \u201cwhen an agent in a particular geographic area was terminated for a legitimate reason, the effect was that the insurance policies of that agent\u2019s clients were not renewed\u201d by the insurer. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">Two years later, the legislature attempted to solve that problem as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-7\">By Ch. 73 of the Acts of 1972, the General Assembly amended \u00a7 234B so that a compromise was reached between the agent\u2019s right to his expirations following termination and the State\u2019s interest in protecting the insureds from cancellations or nonrenewals. As amended in 1972, the statute guarantees that the policies produced by the agent will be renewed through the agent for one year following the agent\u2019s termination. The statute also permits the agency agreement to set forth a longer period.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-8\">Thus, the agent is given the benefit from his expirations for at least a year after termination; he is guaranteed at least a year\u2019s worth of renewal commissions. During that year the agent may ... place his clients with other insurance companies or broker his clients through another agency. The agent may also sell his expirations outright to another agency, as they are a marketable asset. At the end of that one year period, or whatever longer period might be set forth in the agency agreement, the insurance company is required by \u00a7 234B to renew the policies of those insureds who decide to stay with the company, unless there exist valid grounds for nonrenewal other than the termination of the agent. Section 234B(c) states: \u201cNo insurer shall cancel or refuse to renew the policy of the insured because of the termination of the agent\u2019s or broker\u2019s contract.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>Section 284B(c), therefore, requires the insurer to use the former agent\u2019s expirations to renew the policies of those insureds choosing to remain with the insurer. The statute obviously modifies an agent\u2019s property right in his expirations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b423-5\"><em>Merling, </em>326 Md. at 340-41, 605 A.2d 83.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">But \u201cChapter 73 of the Acts of 1972\u201d needed further refinement as insurers were required, under that act, to comply with the notice and renewal rules, regardless of the nature of the insurance that was sold or their relationship to the selling agent. To modify the overreach of these two rules, in 1975, the captive agent exception and the lines of business exception were added. <em>Lincoln National, </em>328 Md. at 75, 612 A.2d 1301.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">Explaining the reasons for that addition, The Court of Appeals stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-8\">The evident purpose of the 1975 amendment was to narrow the scope of the notice rule and of the renewal rule. Although the rules were intended to be limited to property and casualty agents and brokers who owned their expirations, the language employed was broader than the objective. By stating two absolute rules which were limited only by the lines of business exception, the two rules also applied to agents and brokers who were employees of property and casualty insurers, e.g., the direct writers, but who did not own their expirations. Captive agents simply were not part of the problem that the General Assembly sought to address, and they were excepted as well.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b423-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 76, 612 A.2d 1301.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b423-10\">Thus, the purpose of this legislative scheme from its inception in 1970 was to protect insureds from \u201carbitrary or discriminatory\u201d practices, such as \u201credlining,\u201d and insurance agents \u201cfrom arbitrary or discriminatory terminations by insurers.\u201d The two amendments that followed sought to remedy the inequities of the original legislation, without compro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>mising its purpose: The 1972 amendment created a procedure to compensate the agent for the losses he or she might suffer from the transfer of his or her expirations to the insurer, and the 1975 amendment corrected the overreach of the 1972 amendment, by narrowing the scope of the notice and renewal rules that amendment promulgated.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">But the legislation does not serve that purpose here. Appellants do not claim, on appeal, that Metz\u2019s contract was arbitratorily or discriminatorily terminated.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In fact, they do not claim that the contract was unfair in any respect, not even its termination provisions. And, while Metz\u2019s contract with Allstate provided a means to compensate Metz for the work he had produced before his contract was terminated by giving him the right to sell an undefined \u201ceconomic interest\u201d in book of business, it clearly established that Allstate owned Metz\u2019s expirations at its beginning, middle, and end. Earlier on, the R3001 Agreement stated that \u201c[t]he Company will own all business produced under the terms of th[e] Agreement\u201d; and then, later, that all confidential information including \u201cthe names, addresses, and ages of policyholders of the Company; types of policies; amounts of insurance; premium amounts; the description and location of insured property; [and] the expiration or renewal dates of policies ...\u201d is \u201cwholly owned by the Company\u201d; and still later, that \u201c[a]ny confidential information ... recorded on paper, electronic data file, or any other medium, whether provided by the Company or by you, is the exclusive property of the Company as is any such medium and any copy of such medium.\u201d Making the same point, the Allstate agency manual, which was incorporated by reference into the R3001 Agreement, began with the statement that Allstate \u201cowns all business produced by\u201d its agents.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">The agreement also prohibited Metz, upon the termination of his contract, to use the expirations or to let anyone else use them, without Allstate\u2019s permission. And, finally, Metz and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>Allstate agreed, in the R3001 Agreement, as to what would occur and as to what Metz would be entitled to upon its termination. Thus, Metz agreed to accept a termination fee or the compensation he would receive from the transfer of his interest to an Allstate-approved buyer in lieu of the benefits conferred by the notice and renewal rules. The notice and renewal rules kick-in when expirations are taken from an agent, in accordance with the mandate of \u00a7 27-503, and given to the insurer, not when the agent does not own them in the first place, having contractually transferred whatever ownership claim he had in them to the insurer as a part of the bargain the parties had struck at the inception of their relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">The insurer and its agents are free to negotiate the terms of their contractual relationship, including who owns the expirations. Nothing in the legislative history of \u00a7 27-503 or its language suggests that they are not. Nor is it the purpose of that statute to protect an agent from the terms of a lawful agreement that he or she has voluntarily entered into with an insurer. Indeed, when the legislative purpose of Ins. \u00a7 27-503 of protecting insureds is addressed in a contract between insurer and agent, by assigning ownership of the expirations to the insurer at the outset, as occurred here, the insurer and agent are free to agree to any terms which they feel meet their respective needs and goals.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">Appellants claim that, by framing the R3001 Agreement as it did, Allstate was trying to get around the notice and renewal rules and that it should not be rewarded for clever drafting. If Allstate was engaged in \u201cclever drafting,\u201d it was not for the purpose of avoiding having to pay commissions, as it had agreed that Metz could sell his expirations to an approved-buyer. And, in fact, he was in the process of doing precisely that when he obtained a favorable decision from the associate commissioner. After receiving that decision, he suspended negotiations with Allstate but not before directing it to transfer his accounts and revenue stream to the potential purchaser of his expirations \u2014 his brother and fellow Allstate agent, William Metz. And that, to at least some extent, did occur. As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>the Insurance Commissioner noted in his decision, the William P. Metz agency received commissions totaling $28,000 for the months of June, July, August, September, and October, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b412-8\">.
