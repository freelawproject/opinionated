Logan, who was then twenty-four years of age, was subsequently charged with two counts of first-degree premeditated murder and two counts of use of a handgun during the commission of a crime of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">Appellant filed a notice of his intent to raise the defense of not cximinally responsible (\u201cNCR\u201d), pursuant to Md.Code (2001), \u00a7 3-109 of the Criminal Procedure Article (\u201cC.P.\u201d). He later moved to suppress his post-arrest statements. At the conclusion of the hearing in October 2003, the court denied Logan\u2019s motion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A jury in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County subsequently found appellant criminally responsible and convicted him of two counts of second degree murder and two counts of the handgun offense. The court sentenced appellant to a total term of imprisonment of 100 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-7\">Logan presents seven questions for our review, which we quote:<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b29-8\">\n<em>QUESTIONS PERTAINING TO PRETRIAL MOTIONS</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A1\">I. Did the trial court err in denying [appellant\u2019s] motion to suppress his statement where the police violated his <em>Mir\u00e1ndola[</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em>] </em>rights by telling [appellant] that he did not need a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>lawyer during questioning because the truth could not jeopardize him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-4\">\n<em>QUESTIONS PERTAINING TO VOIR DIRE</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-5\">I. Did the trial court err in failing to inquire of the venire whether any of them would have difficulty following the court\u2019s instructions on the defense of not criminally responsible?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-6\">II. Was the trial court\u2019s questioning on pretrial publicity inadequate?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-7\">\n<em>QUESTIONS PERTAINING TO TRIAL AND JURY INSTRUCTIONS</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-8\">I. Did the trial court violate [appellant\u2019s] right of confrontation when the court permitted the State to question one of [appellant\u2019s] experts about the fact that a Prince George\u2019s County Detention Center psychiatrist had failed to find that [appellant] suffered from paranoid schizophrenia?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-9\">II. Did the trial court err in failing to permit [appellant\u2019s] several expert witnesses from explaining to the jury that \u201cappreciating\u201d the criminality of one\u2019s conduct is different from \u201cknowing\u201d that one\u2019s conduct is criminal and in failing to instruct the jury on this distinction?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-10\">III. Did the trial court err in failing [to] instruct the jury on the defense of \u201csettled insanity?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-11\">IV. Did the trial court err in failing to adequately instruct the jury on the distinction between intent and criminal responsibility?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b30-12\">For the reasons that follow, we conclude that the advice of rights was defective, but any error in failing to suppress appellant\u2019s statements was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. However, we agree with appellant that the court erred or abused its discretion in regard to the questions posed on voir dire concerning his NCR defense and pretrial publicity. Because we shall vacate appellant\u2019s convictions and remand for a new trial, we decline to reach appellant\u2019s remaining contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>I. FACTUAL SUMMARY</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">A. Trial<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">On August 29, 2002, Valencia Logan, appellant\u2019s wife, filed an ex parte Petition for Emergency Evaluation (the \u201cPetition\u201d), seeking hospitalization of appellant, claiming he suffered from paranoid schizophrenia. In the Petition, which was admitted at trial, Ms. Logan alleged that appellant\u2019s \u201ccondition is worsening each day.\u201d She asserted in the Petition that appellant \u201csees, hears messages from ([G]od) \u2014 someone. Keeps refering [sic] to the bible, and is saying we are in Revelations.\u201d Further, she averred that there was a \u201cclear and imminent danger\u201d of appellant \u201cdoing harm to self or others,\u201d because he \u201cthinks that death is imminent.\u201d That same day, the District Court for Prince George\u2019s County issued an Emergency Order, directing that appellant \u201cbe taken into custody by any peace officer and transported to Prince George\u2019s Hospital Center for examination and emergency care and treatment if necessary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b31-7\">Appellant\u2019s father, James Logan, Sr., recalled that on the night of August 29, 2002, Deputies Arnaud and Magruder arrived at his home with the Emergency Order. He directed them to the basement, where appellant and his friend were \u201chaving a bible study.\u201d \u201cAfter a period of time,\u201d Mr. Logan heard the male sheriff tell appellant, \u201c \u2018You\u2019ve got to come and go with me now.\u2019 \u201d He also heard appellant reply, \u201c T told you I\u2019m not going with you anywhere.\u2019 \u201d According to Mr. Logan, appellant came up from the basement, went into the guest bedroom, and closed the door. Arnaud and Magruder followed appellant. While Mr. Logan was in the master bedroom with his wife, he \u201cheard something that sounded like loud pops, a few pops or something.\u201d He and his wife mistakenly thought that the deputies had shot appellant. Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>Logan saw appellant exiting the home with what \u201cappeared to be a weapon\u201d in his hands.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">Dr. Jack Matthew Titus, M.D., the Deputy Chief Medical Examiner, testified that Magruder died as the result of a single gunshot wound to the head. Titus further opined that Arnaud died from \u201c[mjultiple gunshot wounds,\u201d one of which \u201chit the carotid artery ...,\u201d which \u201cis the one that goes up to the brain and gives the brain most of its blood supply.\u201d Another gunshot wound \u201cinjured the liver,\u201d and was \u201cassociated with internal bleeding____\u201d Other wounds caused Arnaud to \u201chemorrhage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b32-7\">Appellant was apprehended in the early morning hours of August 31, 2002, several miles from his home,, in a shed adjacent to an apartment building. After being treated at Prince George\u2019s Hospital Center (the \u201cHospital\u201d) for injuries inflicted by the police dog deployed during the apprehension, appellant was taken to the Criminal Investigation Division (\u201cCID\u201d) of the Prince George\u2019s County Police Department for questioning. After signing an Advice of Rights and Waiver form, appellant confessed to the shootings. Although appellant admitted that he intended to kill the sheriffs, he insisted that he was \u201ccommanded\u201d to do so by God.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-8\">In support of his NCR defense, appellant presented the testimony of three expert witnesses: Neil Blumberg, M.D., a general and forensic psychiatrist; Joanna Brandt, M.D., a general and forensic psychiatrist; and Lawrence Donner, Ph. D., a clinical psychologist. The defense experts testified that, at the time of the shootings, appellant suffered from paranoid schizophrenia, which prevented him from appreciating the criminality of his conduct or conforming his conduct to the requirements of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-9\">In rebuttal, the State produced the expert testimony of Scott Uithol, M.D., a general psychiatrist; Marc Tabackman, Ph.D., a psychologist; Christiane Tellefsen, M.D., a forensic psychiatrist; and Robert Phillips, M.D., a general and forensic psychologist. In general, the State\u2019s experts opined that appellant was suffering from a substance induced psychosis at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>the time of the shootings and was criminally responsible for his actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-4\">We shall include additional facts in our discussion of the issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">B. Suppression Motion</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">Prior to trial, appellant moved to suppress the statements he made during his interrogation. Logan claimed, <em>inter alia, </em>that he \u201cwas not properly advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, nor did he waive these rights.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In a supplemental memorandum, appellant focused on statements made by Detective Ismael Canales of the Prince George\u2019s County Police Department. He alleged that the <em>Miranda </em>warnings were defective because Canales \u201cmade false and misleading statements\u201d before and during the advisement, and these deceptive and \u201ccontradictory\u201d statements \u201ceviscerate[d]\u201d the <em>Miranda </em>warnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">In its opposition, the State argued that the colloquy between Detective Canales and appellant was merely \u201can exhortation to tell the truth and in light of the follow up conversations and advices, can in no way be said to be a promise of any sort that [appellant] relied upon.\u201d It maintains that, under Maryland law, \u201cexhortations to tell the truth are permissible approaches for police to encourage a suspect to give a statement.\u201d Moreover, the State asserts that \u201c[a]ny doubt as to whether Canales had promised Logan anything was soon dispelled a few moments later,\u201d when appellant stated that he had neither been promised anything nor threatened by Detective Canales.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-8\">What follows is a summary of the evidence adduced at the suppression hearing with respect to the <em>Miranda </em>issue.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b34-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>Prince George\u2019s County Police Corporal Thomas Brown, Jr. was assigned to the \u201cSpecial Operations Division K9 Unit\u201d on the date in question. He stated that, \u201csometime after 1:30 a.m.\u201d on August 31, 2002, he \u201cresponded to assist\u201d in the apprehension of appellant. Brown recalled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-4\">We ended up tracking to a shed and a dumpster area. At that point the dog indicated the presence of a person inside the building. At that point we set up a perimeter. Several warnings were issued [to appellant] with no results. We used a pepper ball gun to deploy into the building. Several rounds were fired. Once again it [sic] was no response. We breached the doorway and sent the K9 to make apprehension.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">According to Corporal Brown, appellant was in the corner of the shed and the dog was \u201cengaged on\u201d appellant. Brown told appellant \u201cto stop resisting and fighting the dog, which he failed to do.... \u201d At that time, \u201cSergeant Lipsey came in and used a Taser gun\u201d on appellant. Appellant was then arrested. Prince George\u2019s County Police Corporal Michael Seyfried helped transport appellant to the Hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">Homicide detective Ismael Canales, an eleven-year veteran of the Prince George\u2019s County Police Department, \u201cimmediately responded\u201d to the Hospital after he was \u201cnotified\u201d that appellant was headed there. He met appellant in \u201cthe emergency room entryway\u201d at \u201cabout 2:25 in the morning,\u201d and accompanied him during treatment. Canales recalled that appellant sustained \u201cseveral scrapes about his body,\u201d as well as \u201ca puncture wound to one ankle and another puncture wound to an arm.\u201d After appellant received \u201ca couple of sutures ... and ... some antibacterial land of ointment,\u201d he was \u201creleased into [police] custody.\u201d Canales informed appellant that he intended to \u201ctalk to him\u201d at the police station.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>When appellant arrived at police headquarters, he was \u201ctaken straight from the [police] vehicle into the interview room[.]\u201d According to Canales, the audio and video cameras were activated and recorded \u201cwhat occurred after that[.]\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> He explained that appellant\u2019s \u201cmental health issues\u201d were \u201cone of several issues\u201d he kept in mind in deciding to record the interview. Canales recalled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-5\">[Appellant is] actually placed in the interview room [at] about 3:53 in the morning of the 31st [of August], 2002. I\u2019m then in the room several times. I\u2019m in and out of the room several times. One at 4:05 [a.m.] at which point I\u2019m initially asking if he wants food, drink. Just kind of explaining to him what\u2019s going to happen. I then exit the room and [when] I return I provide him with some water, which he had requested.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-6\">I leave out [of] the room sometime after 6:00 [a.m.] later on after we have the discussion. I\u2019m in several more times in and out the rest of the time he\u2019s there until about 7:30, quarter to 8 in the morning.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">The interview began at approximately 4:05 a.m.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> During the interview, appellant was not handcuffed. Moreover, Canales offered food and drink to appellant \u201cthroughout the several times I\u2019m talking to him.\u201d Appellant was also \u201cgiven the opportunity to go to the bathroom.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b35-8\">Before advising appellant of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, Canales obtained general background information from appellant. As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>we shall see, he also gave certain assurances to appellant. Canales then obtained a waiver of rights. We quote at length from the entire interview because the sequence of events and the precise words are crucial to our analysis.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-5\">DETECTIVE CANALES: Okay. You single? Married? Divorced?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-6\">[APPELLANT]: Married.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-7\">DETECTIVE CANALES: What\u2019s your wife\u2019s name?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AI\">[APPELLANT]: Valencia....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-8\">DETECTIVE CANALES: Same last name, Logan?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A5\">[APPELLANT]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-9\">DETECTIVE CANALES: Okay.

DETECTIVE CANALES: Actually what it is [is] just your background information, that\u2019s all. It basically lets me know who you are and basically let [sic] me know some background on you so when you and I start talking, it\u2019s not like I\u2019m talking to a stranger; all right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-15\">[APPELLANT]: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-16\">DETECTIVE CANALES: Okay. Where\u2019s Woodthrush Avenue?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-17\">[APPELLANT]: That\u2019s in Lanham, Maryland.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-18\">DETECTIVE CANALES: And this is whose house?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>[APPELLANT]: That\u2019s her mother\u2019s house.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-5\">DETECTIVE CANALES: Mother\u2019s house.

Like I say, somebody wants to do something to my folks.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-17\">DETECTIVE CANALES: <em>Let me make sure we understand each other; okay. I\u2019m going to look out for your folks; okay. They\u2019re fine. I\u2019ve spoken to them on the phone. They are okay; okay? So you don\u2019t have to worry about anything there; all right?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-18\">[APPELLANT]: All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-19\">DETECTIVE CANALES: As far as your family, believe me I\u2019m a family man as well so I understand where you are coming from. <em>I won\u2019t use any of the information to harm you. No one out here is going to harm, you or your family. You and I are talking.

I don\u2019t want you to think that, you know, this is some trick or anything. What it is right now is we\u2019re trying to get to the bottom of what happened. Make sure the charges fit the crime. If you have something to do with this then we\u2019ll talk about it, see what it is that\u2019s going on. Make sure what you are charged with matches what you did; okay. So that\u2019s all I\u2019m trying to do right now.

The following exchange is pertinent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-6\">DETECTIVE CANALES: Are there any issues with you, and I mean I\u2019m asking the question because you and I both know right now that there is an allegation of some possible mental health issues with you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-7\">[APPELLANT]: <em>There is no 'mental health issue. </em>DETECTIVE CANALES: Are you sure?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-8\">[APPELLANT]: <em>1 don\u2019t have any.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-9\">DETECTIVE CANALES: Okay, there\u2019s no, you don\u2019t believe you\u2019re, you\u2019re God, you don\u2019t think the end of the world is coming, I mean as far as, you know, tomorrow or anything?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-10\">[APPELLANT]: No, I mean I am moved by him [i.e., God] but 1 don\u2019t believe that I am God because....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-11\">DETECTIVE CANALES: I understand that, but right, as far as you\u2019re concerned, <em>a,re there any mental issues?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AS-\">[APPELLANT]: <em>No, I don\u2019t have any.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b43-12\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-13\">During the interview, appellant explained what occurred at his parents\u2019 house on the evening of August 29, 2002.

They said you must see our judge.\u201d Appellant said he asked the sheriffs if they had \u201cany paperwork,\u201d and they responded, \u201cNo, we don\u2019t have any paperwork. No, we don\u2019t have a warrant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b43-14\">Appellant also stated: \u201cI was reading the scripture that said that your God will provide you the force or whatever you have to do. God will provide you the right. All you have to do is just ask him.\u201d Appellant explained that, as the sheriffs ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>proached, he kept the scripture in mind and \u201cstood up and, you know they came at me [with] force and I just like ran and I kind of spinned and ran upstairs, and I was running.... \u201d Logan recalled: \u201cI\u2019m running towards upstairs, and then as I see my hand was provided with a tool or something.\u201d According to appellant, the tool was \u201ca gun,\u201d which \u201cjust appeared in my hand.\u201d He described the gun\u2019s presence as \u201cspiritual or something.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">Logan stated that the gun \u201cwas originally ... in the closet ... in my old [bed]room,\u201d and it appeared in his hand when he was running \u201ctowards the room.\u201d He recalled that, in the upstairs bedroom, he \u201cclose[d] the door and then I open the door and I see that [the sheriffs] pulled they\u2019re pulling out theirs [i.e., their guns], and I\u2019m just, I just did, I mean it was like a force, it wasn\u2019t really me.\u201d Logan elaborated: \u201cI just started shooting.... I didn\u2019t feel I was the one shooting....

I was commanded by my God I had a purpose----\u201d Canales also discussed the effect of the Bible on appellant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-8\">DETECTIVE CANALES: Okay, now so you\u2019re saying so you\u2019re reading [the Bible passage], you\u2019re not actually hearing voices in your head?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-9\">[APPELLANT]: I\u2019m reading it but it was actually moving me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-10\">DETECTIVE CANALES: It\u2019s moving you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-11\">[APPELLANT]: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-12\">DETECTIVE CANALES: So, you\u2019re reading it, you\u2019re feeling what you\u2019re reading, but there\u2019s not voices in your head?

And then all of a sudden I look up and here they [i.e., the sheriffs] come running down the stairs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">Appellant clarified his view of what the scripture said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AX\">[APPELLANT]: ... After I read the scripture and everything and I mean [it said] they would be exposed, the way the [sic] want to come to you, and this and that your people are in danger.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-7\">DETECTIVE CANALES: ... I want to make sure what it is that you\u2019re telling me about what you read.

[Y]ou must handle it by, by any means, and I will grant you the force or the power to do whatever you have to do.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b46-10\">The interview ended at approximately 7:28 a.m., when appellant was \u201ctaken to the restroom, [and] subsequently taken to the Department of Corrections.\u201d Canales denied that he made \u201cany promises, threats, or inducements\u201d to appellant to elicit the statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-11\">On cross-examination, Canales acknowledged that, at the Hospital, he was informed that a lawyer was there to see appellant. The attorney was not brought back to see appellant in the emergency room, however, because appellant never requested an attorney. Moreover, Canales admitted that he never spoke to appellant\u2019s parents, even though Canales told appellant during the interview that he had spoken with them.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-12\">Appellant\u2019s counsel questioned Canales about his statement to appellant after the <em>Miranda </em>advisement that \u201cthe only way <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>this jeopardizes you is if you don\u2019t tell the truth[.]\u201d The following colloquy is pertinent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-5\">[COUNSEL FOR APPELLANT]: [Y]ou\u2019re saying to [appellant] you have the right to remain silent. If you choose to give up this right, anything that you say can be used against you in court; correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-6\">[DETECTIVE CANALES]: That\u2019s correct, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-7\">[COUNSEL FOR APPELLANT]: Now when you say that or you read that and you read that to a suspect and you also read to them ... the only way this jeopardizes you is if you don\u2019t tell the truth; okay. Aren\u2019t you in <em>effect </em>\u2014 weren\u2019t <em>you telling him that if he told the truth everything will be all right?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-8\">[STATE]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-9\">THE COURT: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-10\">[DETECTIVE CANALES]: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-11\">[COUNSEL FOR APPELLANT]: What were you telling him, sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-12\">[DETECTIVE CANALES]: <em>I was telling him if you tell the truth, I believe you can\u2019t go wrong any time you tell the truth. That helps the finder of fact to tell the truth.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-13\">[COUNSEL FOR APPELLANT]: The only way this jeopardizes you is if you don\u2019t tell the truth?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-14\">[DETECTIVE CANALES]: [H]e doesn\u2019t jeopardize himself with me as far as anything is concerned regarding that statement. I\u2019m not the one whose going to punish him in any way. It\u2019s no punishment attached to it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-15\">[COUNSEL FOR APPELLANT]: <em>He had not yet initialed the [Advice of Rights] form, had he?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-16\">[DETECTIVE CANALES]: <em>That\u2019s correct, sir.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-17\">[COUNSEL FOR APPELLANT]: He had not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AoO\">[DETECTIVE CANALES]: I don\u2019t believe he had, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>[COUNSEL FOR APPELLANT]: And until a person is advised of these rights and initials the form, you can\u2019t proceed with questioning, could you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-6\">[DETECTIVE CANALES]: That\u2019s correct, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-8\">Prince George\u2019s County Police Lieutenant Daniel Lipsey was the State\u2019s final witness. Lipsey, who was on the scene when appellant was apprehended, recalled: \u201cThe defendant was taken from the shed that we apprehended him in, pulled out, placed against a dumpster that was right next to it, handcuffed, and then patted down. At that point when we found out it was [sic] no weapons on him, he was transported by two officers\u201d to the Hospital. Lieutenant Lipsey denied \u201chearing] anybody make any promises or inducements\u201d to appellant or hearing appellant request a lawyer. While appellant was in his presence, neither he nor any other officer advised appellant of his rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-9\">Appellant called two witnesses: Scott Little, Esquire and Karen Logan, appellant\u2019s mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-10\">Little stated that, prior to appellant\u2019s arrest, he was retained by appellant\u2019s parents to represent appellant. Following appellant\u2019s arrest, Little went to the Hospital, but was not able to see appellant. Little recalled that he told a police officer that he wanted to speak to appellant \u201cimmediately as soon as they were done with whatever treatment they were doing.\u201d According to Little, the officer \u201csaid as soon as they\u2019re finished, he\u2019d come back and get me and I can talk to my client.\u201d About twenty minutes later, that officer \u201ccame back\u201d and \u201ctold [Little] that Mr. Logan was no longer at the hospital\u201d and that \u201che had been taken over to the ... police station.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b48-11\">At the police station, Little informed two officers that he \u201cwanted to see Mr. Logan,\u201d but his requests were denied. Little estimated that he remained at the station approximately \u201cthree hours,\u201d all the while \u201cbeing unable to see\u201d appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>Appellant\u2019s mother testified that, on August 30, 2002, the day after the shootings, she and her husband retained Mr. Little. Mrs. Logan recalled that, on the night of appellant\u2019s arrest, she and her husband went to the police station at approximately 2:35 a.m., and were told that appellant had been taken to the Hospital. They arrived at the Hospital and told security that they wanted to see appellant. But, after waiting \u201calmost an hour,\u201d they were informed that appellant had been taken to the police station. They then returned to the station for the second time. While there, Little asked to see appellant, but the \u201cgentleman that he spoke to told him that [appellant] had not requested a lawyer.\u201d Mrs. Logan and her husband remained at the station \u201cat least maybe thirty minutes\u201d and they never saw appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">The court then heard argument.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> As to the alleged \u201cMiranda, advice of rights, and waiver\u201d violation, appellant emphasized that he was not focusing on voluntariness. He asserted: \u201cUnlike the voluntariness standard which tolerates substantially official pressure!,] <em>Miranda </em>waivers are to be a free will decision,\u201d without \u201cpolice manipulation.\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">The court questioned appellant\u2019s counsel about Detective Canales\u2019s <em>post-Miranda </em>statement to appellant that \u201cthe only thing that may jeopardize you is if you don\u2019t tell the truth.\u201d The following exchange is pertinent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-7\">THE COURT: How does that mislead when he\u2019s also advised you have the right to stop at any time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-8\">[COUNSEL FOR APPELLANT]: Well, its [sic] misleading when you say on [the] one hand anything that you say can and will be used against you and on the other hand say the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>only thing \u2014 the only way that jeopardizes you is [it] you don\u2019t tell the truth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-4\">THE COURT: <em>[CJan\u2019t [that] be interpreted to mean if you decide to talk, the only problem will be if you don\u2019t tell me the truth[?J</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-5\">[COUNSEL FOR APPELLANT]: <em>That could be interpreted that way. </em>The interpretation that way the only problem ... is <em>if you don\u2019t tell me the truth and you lie, the inference you can draw from that is that is admissible in evidence. If you do tell the truth, it won\u2019t be </em>\u2014 you <em>won\u2019t jeopardize yourself. How else does the phrase jeopardy have any meaning?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-6\">THE COURT: <em>You\u2019re not talking about a lawyer using that language.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-7\">[COUNSEL FOR APPELLANT]: But the State has the burden and the burden that they say in <em>Miranda </em>is the burden. They have to[ ] in effect say [there\u2019s] no possible way that could be interpreted to mean that if you tell him the truth it wouldn\u2019t be used against him in evidence. They have the burden, not the defense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-8\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-9\">I\u2019m saying that there\u2019s a substantial disagreement that you can read into that as to whether or not that means if you don\u2019t tell the truth, it won\u2019t be used against you [sic]. It was misleading. In that respect it was deceptive.... [T]his waiver was involuntary in light of that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b50-10\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-11\">Referring to <em>Hart v. Attorney General of the State of Florida, </em>323 F.3d 884 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied sub nom., Crist v. Hart, </em>540 U.S. 1069, 124 S.Ct. 813, 157 L.Ed.2d 733 (2003), in which the police officer told the suspect, \u201cHonesty won\u2019t hurt you,\u201d appellant\u2019s lawyer stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-12\">They [i.e., the 11th Circuit] granted a writ [of habeas corpus] after a state court denied and after a federal district court denied relief, they reversed everybody and suppressed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>a statement finding that the statement was taken in violation of <em>Miranda </em>on the advice of rights form.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-4\">* ;|:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-5\">What the court said in response to that at the Eleventh Circuit [is that tjelling him that honesty wouldn\u2019t hurt him contradicted the <em>Miranda </em>warning that anything he said could be used against him in court.... It\u2019s the same thing here. <em>Honesty will not hwrt you is no different in substance than saying the only way this jeopardizes you is if you don\u2019t tell the truth. </em>It\u2019s just the flip side of the same meaning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-6\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-7\">[Ajnd again, the point that they make is that a <em>Miranda </em>warning as opposed to traditional voluntariness and <em>Miranda advice </em>will not look or <em>mil not tolerate any misleading or any kind of deception whatsoever as opposed to ... what lis] allowed you in terms of traditional voluntariness.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"A9e\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-8\">The State countered that, under the totality of the circumstances, appellant\u2019s statements were admissible. It referred the court to Maryland cases in which, on traditional voluntariness grounds, the appellate courts affirmed various exhortations to tell the truth. The State argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-9\">[Appellant] leaves the hospital after approximately an hour and forty minutes. Approximately at 3:40 [a.m.] ... He\u2019s taken back to CID arriving somewhere in the area around right before 4 a.m. ... And he\u2019s taken, again, filmed, no discussion, no promise, no threats, no inducements. Taken right to the interview room where he\u2019s filmed. You can see it in the beginning of the tape....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-10\">This is where the handcuffs are being taken off. He\u2019s put in the room. He\u2019s just sitting there. Wide awake. Alert. Waiting. Hanging out for approximately 15 minutes if you want to time it. Until Detective Canales comes in the room and starts discussing, talking to the defendant.... <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>Clearly it\u2019s a totality. That\u2019s the law, Your Honor....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-4\">I want the court to look at the totality of this statement from everything that\u2019s said from Detective Canales and back to the defendant. He\u2019s treated with kid gloves immediately. Filmed. Taken right to the hospital. Right back to CID. On film the entire time. Anything we can do for you he\u2019s told. Food. Drink.... Great rapport going on between the defendant and Detective Canales. It\u2019s no time I don\u2019t want to talk to you. No hesitation between the defendant. He\u2019s freely and voluntarily talking. It can\u2019t be any thought about it when you look at the nature of the conversation. That\u2019s why it\u2019s wonderful that [it] is done on tape and Your Honor has a chance to see it.

THE <em>MIRANDA </em>WAIVER</p>\n<p id=\"b54-10\">Appellant challenges the legality of the <em>Miranda </em>advisement. He contends: \u201cThe deception employed by the police, particularly in light of the lengthy colloquy between the police and [appellant] prior to the giving of <em>Miranda </em>rights vitiated [appellant\u2019s] rights and nullified his waiver.\u201d While acknowledging that a \u201c \u2018degree of police deception to obtain a confession is tolerated[,]\u2019 \u201d appellant insists that \u201ccourts around the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>country have held that the type of deception employed here by the police is not to be tolerated and serves to vitiate the <em>Miranda </em>warnings and render any waiver of them invalid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">In particular, Logan argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-6\">Prior to the giving of the constitutionally required <em>Miranda </em>warnings, the Detective repeatedly advised Mr. Logan that the two \u201cwere just talking\u201d and that the officer was not looking to hurt Mr. Logan. He lied to Mr. Logan about the safety of his family. Worse still, when Mr. Logan asked whether he might be better off with the assistance of counsel, <em>the Detective completely contradicted the warnings and told Mr. Logan that truthful statements concerning the commission of criminal acts would not jeopardize him, so long as he told the truth. Quite obviously, this statement stood in stark contrast to the warning of Miranda that any statement could be used against Mr. Logan in </em>court.... <em>The police deceived Mr. Logan into believing that \u201chonesty would not hurt him\u201d </em>and that the statements made were nothing more than Mr. Logan and Detective Canales \u201cjust talking,\u201d suggesting that the conversation was somehow off the record. It is not insignificant that Detective Canales was aware that Mr. Logan might suffer from a mental illness and the colloquy prior to the giving of the <em>Miranda </em>warnings, in and of themselves constitutionally troublesome, <em>reeks of rendering the warnings useless.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-8\">Emphasizing that his argument is not predicated on traditional voluntariness, appellant explains that \u201cthe question is not whether Mr. Logan\u2019s will was overborne but, rather, whether the <em>Miranda </em>warnings he received were effectively nullified by Detective Canales\u2019 erroneous statement that he could be jeopardized by what he said <em>only </em>if he failed to speak truthfully.\u201d Accordingly, appellant argues that the trial court erred in failing to suppress his statements, because his \u201cwaiver of his <em>Miranda </em>rights was not a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary choice in light of the police deception in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b55-9\">In his reply brief, appellant elucidates his contention:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>The point ... is not that Mr. Logan\u2019s statement was involuntary in the constitutional sense but, rather, that <em>the Miranda warnings he received prior to making that statement were infirm. </em>Although Detective Canales told Mr. Logan that he had the right to remain silent, did not have to answer any questions, and that any statement he made could be used against him in court, <em>he effectively vitiated those warnings by reassuring Mr. Logan that, as long as he told the truth about committing the crimes, no harm would befall him. Quite obviously, this was a direct contradiction of the constitutionally required advisement </em>that any statement Mr. Logan made could be used against him in court <em>and wholly undermined the significance of the right to remain silent.[</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark><em>]</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">The State counters that the court \u201cproperly denied Logan\u2019s motion to suppress his statement.\u201d Looking to the totality of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>the circumstances, it asserts \u201cthat this was not, by any stretch, a threatening interrogation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">Despite appellant\u2019s claim that his contention is not based on traditional voluntariness, the State seems to focus on that concept. It argues that \u201cthe totality of the circumstances here indicate that Logan gave a voluntary statement to Canales after making a voluntary and knowing waiver of his Miranda rights.\u201d The State adds: \u201c \u2018 \u201cWhen the issue is voluntariness, the failure of a defendant to testify almost forecloses any chance of prevailing.... Without such testimony, there is usually no direct evidence of involuntariness.\u201d \u2019 \u201d (Quoting <em>Uzzle v. State, </em>152 Md.App. 548, 571-72, 832 A.2d 869, <em>cert. denied, </em>378 Md. 619, 837 A.2d 929 (2003) (quoting <em>Ashford v. State, </em>147 Md.App. 1, 56, 807 A.2d 732 (2002))). In support of its position, the State observes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-6\">Logan signed the <em>Miranda </em>form provided to him, acknowledging that he understood his rights. Logan proceeded to talk \u201cfreely\u201d about shooting Arnaud and Magruder. During the three-and-a-half hour interrogation, Logan never requested an attorney nor expressed a desire to remain silent. Logan\u2019s statement was not induced by threats or promises. In fact, nowhere in the record does there exist an identifiable quid pro quo typical of a coercive tactic.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-7\">Furthermore, the record indicates that Detective Canales never deceived Logan into waiving his rights or giving a statement. Canales specifically told Logan that he had the right to remain silent, that he did not have to answer any questions, and that he could stop answering questions at any time during the interrogation. He warned Logan, however, that any statement he made could be used against him in court. Logan stated explicitly that he understood these rights before he made his statement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b57-8\">Alternatively, the State asserts: \u201c \u2018[T]he admission of an \u201cinvoluntary\u201d confession at trial is subject to harmless-error analysis.\u2019 \u201d It argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-9\">Logan\u2019s complicity in the murders of Deputy James Arnaud and Deputy Elizabeth Magruder was undisputed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>Even Logan concedes that the core issue in this case was the \u201cbattle\u201d between the experts on the \u201cinsanity issue,\u201d ... and Logan\u2019s statement had no material impact on this aspect of the case. Accordingly, even if it was error to admit Logan\u2019s statement, such error, under the circumstances, was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">(Citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">In light of his NCR defense, appellant challenges the State\u2019s \u201charmless error\u201d analysis. He argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-7\">[I]t cannot be said that the introduction of Mr. Logan\u2019s confession was harmless considering that the State made a tactical decision to utilize Mr. Logan\u2019s confession in its case in chief, notwithstanding that criminal agency was not in dispute. The net effect of the statement\u2019s introduction into evidence was to portray Mr. Logan as a \u201cnormal\u201d person, having a conversation with detectives in an interrogation room, and admitting to intentionally shooting the two victims. Thus, contrary to what the State suggests, Mr. Logan\u2019s confession did not merely pertain to the guilt/innocence issue, but was affirmatively used by the State as a preemptive strike against Mr. Logan\u2019s defense that he was not criminally responsible. As such, its admission into evidence cannot be considered harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b58-8\">Our review of the trial court\u2019s ruling with respect to a suppression motion is based solely on the record of the suppression hearing. <em>State v. Collins, </em>367 Md. 700, 706-07, 790 A.2d 660 (2002); <em>Cartnail v. State, </em>359 Md. 272, 282, 753 A.2d 519 (2000); <em>Cooper v.

Moreover, we extend <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>great deference to the fact-finding of the motion court, accepting the facts as found, unless clearly erroneous. <em>State v.

State, 355 </em>Md. 356, 368, 735 A.2d 491 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\">Nevertheless, we must make our own independent constitutional appraisal as to the admissibility of a defendant\u2019s statements by reviewing the law and applying it to the facts of the case. <em>Crosby v. State, </em>366 Md. 518, 526, 784 A.2d 1102 (2001), <em>cert. denied, 535 </em>U.S. 941, 122 S.Ct. 1325, 152 L.Ed.2d 233 (2002); <em>Wilkes v. State, </em>364 Md. 554, 569, 774 A.2d 420 (2001). We accomplish this by conducting a <em>de novo </em>review of the law and applying it to the first-level facts found by the suppression judge. <em>Nathan v.

Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). <em>See Missouri v. Seibert, </em>542 U.S. 600, -, 124 S.Ct. 2601, 2608 n. 1, 159 L.Ed.2d 643 (2004); <em>Winder v.

There is no prescribed form or set way in which to waive <em>Miranda </em>rights, however. As the Supreme Court said in <em>North Carolina v.

LaFave, et al., 2 Criminal Procedure \u00a7 6.9(c) (3d.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\">Appellant relies on <em>Hart v. Attorney Gen. of the State of Florida, </em>323 F.3d 884 (11th Cir.2003), in which the defendant challenged the validity of his <em>Miranda </em>waiver. In that case, after the teenaged defendant was informed of his rights by one detective, he signed the waiver form and then asked to speak to another detective, with whom he was familiar. <em>Id. </em>at 887-88. When that detective arrived, the defendant asked her \u201copinion\u201d as to \u201cthe pros and cons of having an attorney.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 888. The second detective responded \u201cthat in her opinion the pros of having an attorney were \u2018He\u2019ll protect your rights. He\u2019ll tell you what to answer, what not to answer, and he\u2019ll be here for you.\u2019 She told him the con in her opinion was \u2018I\u2019m going to want to ask you questions and he\u2019s going to tell you you can\u2019t answer me.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>At the suppression hearing, the detective acknowledged that while she never told the defendant that giving a statement would help his situation, she did tell him \u201c \u2018honesty wouldn\u2019t hurt him.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 889. The court denied the suppression motion, concluding that the appellant did not make an unequivocal request for an attorney and, consequently, the detective\u2019s colloquy with Hart did not render his waiver involuntary, unintelligent, and unknowing. <em>Id. </em>at 890, 890 n. 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>The Eleventh Circuit subsequently granted the defendant\u2019s request for habeas corpus relief. It concluded that the waiver was invalid, as \u201cthe product of deception,\u201d and was made without \u201cfull awareness\u201d of \u201cthe consequences of the decision .... \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 893. The court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-5\">In this ease, Detective Mauer [i.e., the first detective] went to great lengths to apprise Hart of his rights. He testified that he went over the <em>Miranda </em>rights waiver form with Hart and carefully explained each <em>Miranda </em>warning to Hart, including that anything he said could be used against him in court. Mauer testified that Hart signed the form to indicate that he understood each right and that he was willing to answer questions without a lawyer.... <em>Our analysis cannot end with Hart\u2019s signing of the waiver form because we are required to examine the \u2018totality of the circumstances surrounding the interrogation\u2019 to determine whether Hart\u2019s decision to waive his rights was made voluntarily, knowingly, and </em>intelligently}]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b64-6\"><em>Id. </em>(Citation omitted in Hart) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">The court determined: \u201cAlthough asking for the pros and cons of hiring a lawyer is not an unequivocal request for counsel, it does indicate that Hart did not fully understand his right to counsel and was asking for clarification of that right.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 894. Of import here, the court also addressed the significance of the second detective\u2019s comment to the defendant that \u201chonesty wouldn\u2019t hurt him.\u201d The court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-8\"><em>Telling him that \u201chonesty wouldn\u2019t hurt him\u201d contradicted the Miranda warning that anything he said could be used against him in court.1 </em>] <em>The phrase \u201chonesty mil not hurt you\u201d is simply not compatible with the phrase \u201canything you say can be used against you in court. \u201d The former suggested to Hart that an incriminating statement would not have detrimental consequences while the latter suggested (correctly) that an incriminating statement would be presented at his trial as evidence of his guilt.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b64-9\"><em>Id. </em>(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-10\">The Eleventh Circuit concluded, <em>id. </em>at 895 (emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number><em>Given the totality of the circumstances surrounding the interrogation, which include Hart\u2019s trust of Schuster lie., the second detective] and Schuster\u2019s statements contradicting the Miranda warnings, we cannot say that Hart\u2019s decision to waive his rights and confess was voluntary, knowing, and intelligent. His decision to waive his rights and confess was the product of Schuster\u2019s deception and, as a result of her contradictory statements, </em>he did not truly understand the nature of his right against self-incrimination or the consequences that would result from waiving it. <em>Therefore, his waiver was' not voluntary, knowing, and intelligent as required by Miranda, </em>and the state court\u2019s failure to apply the correct legal standard to this issue resulted in a decision that was contrary to clearly established federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">Appellant also refers us to the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Beale, </em>921 F.2d 1412 (11th Cir.), <em>cert denied, </em>502 U.S. 829, 112 S.Ct. 99, 100, 116 L.Ed.2d 71 (1991). In that case, the defendants were convicted in federal court of participating in a racketeering organization that committed a series of armored truck robberies in Florida between 1982 and 1985. <em>Id. </em>at 1419. Of the nearly one hundred witnesses who testified at the trial, most were either witnesses to the robberies or federal law enforcement officials who investigated them. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">On appeal, one of the defendants, Francisco Lavin, a native of Cuba, claimed that he did not understand his constitutional rights and \u201csigned the waiver form only after the FBI agents told him that signing the form would not hurt him.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1434. Lavin had a fifth grade education and did not speak English or read Spanish. <em>Id. </em>However, an FBI agent, certified in speaking Spanish, had testified that he was present when another agent, a native Spanish-speaker, orally advised Lavin of his <em>Miranda </em>rights in Spanish and provided Lavin with a waiver form in Spanish. <em>Id. </em>According to the agent, Lavin signed the form after he read it and stated that he understood it. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>The appellate court concluded that the trial court erred by . admitting the statements made by Lavin after he signed the waiver form, but determined that the error was harmless. <em>Id. </em>at 1435. Significantly, the court ruled that the waiver was not \u201cvoluntary, knowing and intelligent,\u201d <em>id., </em>because Lavin \u201csigned the waiver only after the agent told him that signing the form would not hurt him.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1435. The Eleventh Circuit reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-5\">Although the Supreme Court has held that the police do not have to recite the <em>Miranda </em>warnings in a talismanic fashion, the warnings must not be <em>misleading.... It appears that by telling Lavin that signing the waiver would not hurt him the agents contradicted the Miranda warning that a defendant\u2019s statements can be used against the defendant in court, thereby misleading Lavin concerning the consequences of relinquishing his right to remain silent. </em>.... Accordingly, the district court erred by admitting Lavin\u2019s statement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b66-6\"><em>Id. </em>(Emphasis added) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">Nevertheless, the court was satisfied that \u201cthe remaining evidence is not only sufficient to support the conviction but so overwhelming as to establish Lavin\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1435. Accordingly, it found the error harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-8\">Additionally, appellant relies on <em>State v. Stanga, </em>617 N.W.2d 486 (S.D.2000). In that case, the defendant was charged with burglary, simple assault, and violating a domestic protection order. <em>Id. </em>at 488. During the advisement of <em>Miranda </em>rights, the detective assured the defendant \u201cthat any statement he gave was \u2018between you and me,\u2019 signifying that it would not go beyond the interrogation room.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 487. Furthermore, to induce the defendant to talk, the detective told the defendant, \u201c \u2018you need to get this off your chest.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 489. When the defendant told the detective, \u201c T know you\u2019re here to get something against me[,]\u2019 \u201d the detective responded: \u201c \u2018No, I\u2019m here for you and I to talk.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>The detective also assured the defendant, \u201c \u2018You can trust me straight up.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b67-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>The defendant sought to suppress his confession, claiming he did not make a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary waiver of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. <em>Id. </em>at 487. In particular, the defendant contended that \u201cthe required <em>Miranda </em>warning that any admission can be used in court was subverted by the suggestion that admissions would not be used against him.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court determined that the trial court erred by admitting the defendant\u2019s confession, but found the error harmless. <em>Id. </em>at 491. Of import here, the <em>Stanga </em>Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-4\">After giving the <em>Miranda </em>warning to Stanga, [Detective] Lubbers repeatedly contradicted the admonition that anything Stanga said could be used against him. <em>Lubbers told Stanga twelve times that what was said during the interrogation was between the two of them. </em>. In the suppression hearing and in the trial, Lubbers admitted that he lied to Stanga when he told him that what he said would not go any further than the interview room.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-5\"><em>Some of the detective\u2019s comments were equivocal and, might fairly be characterized as sympathetic colloquialisms </em>..., but <em>several of the assurances clearly crossed the line. </em>When Stanga said that he knew that Lubbers was there to get something against him and Lubbers responded \u201cNo, I\u2019m here for you and I to talk,\u201d that and comments like it nullified the <em>Miranda </em>warnings. <em>Although trickery is sometimes a legitimate interrogation technique, Miranda warnings are a \u201cconcrete\u201d prerequisite to custodial interrogation and may not be manipulated through deception.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"App\"><em>Id. </em>at 490-91 (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\"><em>United States v. Cohen, </em>372 F.Supp.2d 340 (E.D.N.Y.2005), is also noteworthy.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In that case, the defendant, who was charged with sexual assault of a fellow airline passenger, moved to suppress statements made outside of the plane and at the police station, contending that the statements were obtained in violation of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. <em>Id. </em>at 340-41. In particular, the defendant claimed that, during the administra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>tion of the <em>Miranda </em>warnings, he asked the detective whether he needed a lawyer and, in response, the detective shrugged, motioned with his hands that it was up to the defendant, <em>id. </em>at 347, and told him \u201cif you have nothing to hide, then you do not need a lawyer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 348. The defendant argued that the detective\u2019s statement was \u201cthe equivalent of telling the suspect that \u2018honesty wouldn\u2019t hurt him,\u2019 a phrase found by the Eleventh Circuit [in <em>Hart </em>] to contradict <em>Miranda\u2019s </em>admonition that anything the suspect says can be used against him.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 359-60 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">The federal trial court agreed that \u201c \u2018deceptive stratagems such as giving false legal advice\u2019 ... render[ ] a <em>[Miranda </em>] waiver invalid[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 360 (citation omitted). But, the court concluded that the detective\u2019s statement was \u201cnot a misstatement of the law,\u201d <em>id., </em>and denied the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress. <em>Id. </em>at 361. The <em>Cohen </em>court distinguished the matter before it from <em>Hart, </em>reasoning, <em>id. </em>at 360-61:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-6\">For every suspect, \u201cif you have nothing to hide, then you don\u2019t need a lawyer\u201d is always true. An individual that has not committed a crime cannot make incriminating statements. On the other hand, \u201chonesty will not hurt you\u201d is only true for suspects that have not committed a crime, but is always false for those that have. The distinction between these statements, then, is that one is true and [the other] is not. And only \u201caffirmative misrepresentations by the police\u201d are prohibited by <em>Miranda, </em>not \u201cploys to mislead a suspect or to [l]ull him into a false sense of security that do not rise to the level of compulsion or coercion [.]\u201d <em>[United States v.] Anderson, </em>929 F.2d [96,] 100 [ (2d Cir.1991) ], <em>quoting Illinois v. Perkins, </em>496 U.S. 292, 297, 110 S.Ct. 2394, 110 L.Ed.2d 243 (1990). The combination of \u201cif you have nothing to hide\u201d and a shrug is not an affirmative misrepresentation or misstatement of the law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b68-7\"><em>United States v. Chadwick, </em>999 F.2d 1282 (8th Cir.1993), also provides guidance. In <em>Chadwick, </em>the defendant was indicted by a federal grand jury for various drug offenses. <em>Id. </em>at 1283-84. A federal agent went to the defendant\u2019s home to interview him. At the outset of the interview, the agent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>advised the defendant of his <em>Miranda </em>rights and obtained a written waiver. <em>Id. </em>at 1284. The defendant later sought to suppress any incriminating statements made during the interview, contending, <em>inter alia, </em>that his waiver was invalidated by the agent\u2019s post-waiver statement that the defendant\u2019s cooperation would \u201c \u2018help\u2019 \u201d him. <em>Id. </em>at 1286. The federal district court agreed and suppressed the statements. <em>Id. </em>at 1286. The Eighth Circuit reversed, concluding that the agent\u2019s \u201cstatement that Chadwick\u2019s cooperation would \u2018help\u2019 him could not have had any impact on Chadwick\u2019s decision to waive his <em>Miranda </em>rights, since the waiver had occurred earlier.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court was satisfied that the agent\u2019s statement \u201cdid not in any way influence the waiver.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b69-4\">As we assess the facts of this case in light of the authorities discussed above, we recognize that \u201c[c]ustodial interrogations ... have long been a traditional component of police law enforcement....\u201d <em>Winder, </em>362 Md. at 304, 765 A.2d 97. Indeed, such interrogations are an essential tool in \u201cinvestigating crimes and bringing perpetrators to justice. ...\u201d <em>Ball, </em>347 Md. at 178, 699 A.2d 1170; <em>see Moran, </em>475 U.S. at 426, 106 S.Ct. 1135. Nevertheless, the \u201cconduct\u201d of an interrogation is not without \u201cboundaries.\u201d <em>Winder, </em>362 Md. at 305, 765 A.2d 97. Our review of the authorities cited above convinces us that, under the totality of the circumstances, the court erred in finding a valid waiver of <em>Miranda,.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">We cannot ignore that, before the formal advisement that culminated in appellant\u2019s waiver, Detective Canales provided repeated assurances to appellant, asserting many times that the two were \u201cjust talking.\u201d He also assured Logan that he \u201cwon\u2019t use any of the information to harm\u201d appellant and that he (Canales) was not \u201chere to hurt\u201d appellant. Then, during the formal advisement of rights, when appellant stated that he \u201cfelt kind of comfortable, better with a lawyer,\u201d Canales again responded by saying, \u201cwe\u2019re talking.\u201d That response was a clear reference to Canales\u2019s earlier assurances to appellant during the background inquiry. Appellant immediately answered by expressing concern that he did not \u201cwant to jeop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>ardize anything,\u201d and Canales responded: \u201cThe only way this jeopardizes you is if you don\u2019t tell the truth.... If you\u2019re telling the truth, we will get through this.... \u201d Only then did appellant execute the waiver form.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">We underscore that the statements in issue were made immediately <em>prior </em>to and <em>durivig </em>the advisement of rights. Inde\u00e9d, shortly <em>after </em>advising appellant under <em>Miranda </em>that he had the \u201cright to remain silent,\u201d and that anything appellant said could \u201cbe used against [him] in court,\u201d but <em>before </em>appellant signed the waiver, Canales told appellant that \u201cthe only way this jeopardizes you is if you don\u2019t tell the truth.\u201d That representation flatly contradicted the <em>Miranda </em>warning, and thus nullified what had been said.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">As we see it, Canales\u2019s various statements, including his assurances that \u201cwe\u2019re talking,\u201d \u201c[t]he only way this jeopardizes you is if you don\u2019t tell the truth,\u201d and he \u201cwon\u2019t use any of the information to harm\u201d appellant, were akin to the flawed assertion in <em>Hart, </em>323 F.3d at 889, that \u201chonesty won\u2019t hurt you.\u201d They constituted affirmative misstatements that conflicted with the <em>Miranda </em>advisement that anything appellant said could be used against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">We acknowledge that appellant seemed to be aware of his <em>Miranda </em>rights even before Canales advised him. Indeed, appellant articulated some of his rights before Canales advised him. For example, appellant stated: \u201cI got a right to Miranda. I got a right to remain silent.\u201d Furthermore, appellant had recently been arrested on a drug charge and, at that time, was advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. But, given the heavy burden on the State, we cannot excuse what happened here merely because appellant had prior experience with the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-8\">To be sure, we do not suggest that the statements at issue could not have been cured by the police, so as to secure a valid waiver of <em>Miranda </em>rights. But, Canales\u2019s statement to appellant that \u201cthe only way this jeopardizes you is if you don\u2019t tell the truth\u201d occurred during the advisement itself, just after Canales told appellant that anything he said could be used <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>against him, and before appellant actually executed the waiver form. The misstatement was never corrected or clarified by Canales, to impress upon appellant that his statements could, indeed, jeopardize him. In particular, Canales never undertook to make clear to appellant that the two were no longer \u201cjust talking\u201d; he did not dispel the notion that no \u201charm\u201d would come to appellant if he made a statement; and he did not clarify that the truth would \u201cjeopardize\u201d appellant. Therefore, the advisement remained fatally flawed. For this reason, we conclude that the court erred by denying appellant\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">Nevertheless, we are of the view that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See Dorsey v. State, </em>276 Md. 638, 648, 350 A.2d 665 (1976) (\u201cIn those circumstances where a violation of a right protected by the Federal Constitution occurs, the Supreme Court, as the ultimate arbiter in interpreting and implementing constitutional guarantees, has declared such error to be \u2018harmless,\u2019 where, upon a review of the evidence offered the \u2018[C]ourt [is] able to declare a belief that it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt\u2019 \u201d) (citation omitted) (alterations in <em>Dorsey); see also Spain v.

Instead, appellant\u2019s defense centered on his claim that he was not criminally responsible for his actions. Therefore, the admission of appellant\u2019s inculpatory statements, in which appellant confessed to the murders, was not prejudicial with respect to the identity of the murderer.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">The question remains as to whether the admission of appellant\u2019s statements was prejudicial to his NCR defense. The entire interview transcript was admitted at trial. During the interview, appellant denied that he had mental health issues or problems. In its closing argument, the State relied on those denials to support its contention that appellant\u2019s conduct was not the result of his mental illness. Specifically, the State argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-7\">You see in his statement time and time again he says I made the decision to do this. The tape does not in any way show the person to be schizophrenic....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-8\">[H]e clearly says I\u2019m not hearing any voices. There is no auditory hallucinations. He is not hearing any voices, so that\u2019s out. The defense experts will say [sic] you see the tape, he was commanded to do this. Yeah, he does say that at one point. He also says I would have gone with them if they would have shown me a warrant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b72-9\">On the other hand, the defense relied heavily on the statements to support the NCR defense. Appellant\u2019s counsel maintained that the statements showed appellant \u201cwas floridly psychotic during the interview itself.\u201d In closing, he pointed out that appellant gave</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-10\">the most bizarre reasons based on delusions and hallucinations, religious preoccupation as to why he did what he did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>He was forced by a messenger of God to get up and run from downstairs to upstairs, that a gun just appeared.

He was granted the force and power to do what he did. He can\u2019t run outside as opposed to going in the bedroom. Why didn\u2019t you just leave, go out the back door, or out the front door? He said I can\u2019t because my people would be in danger? At that time his family wasn\u2019t even there, his wife and children.

Paranoid schizophrenia during the time of the statement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">Appellant\u2019s attorney also maintained that Logan\u2019s own assessment of his mental condition, as relied on by the State, was not determinative of his actual mental state. In his closing argument, appellant\u2019s counsel argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-8\"><em>I Am Not Sick, I Don\u2019t Need Help[. Ajs I told you in my opening statement ..., that was the fundamental problem and misunderstanding of James Ramiah Logan </em>before, during and after August 29, 2002. This misperception by him, <em>the misperception by him as to his own mental health problems, </em>along with his severe mental disorder, schizophrenia, paranoid, which existed and manifested itself for a long period both before and after the shootings[,] directly caused Mr. Logan to shoot and kill Deputy Sheriffs James Arnaud and Elizabeth Magruder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-9\">His answers [during the interview] include even then, two days [after the shootings], the first thing [Canales] says <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>early on in the interview, how are you feeling, James? Any problems? Any mental health problems? <em>I have no problems </em>[responds appellant]. <em>I am not mentally ill [he says] to Canales. </em>Read it in the statement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">On balance, we conclude that admission of appellant\u2019s statements was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Therefore, we next consider appellant\u2019s challenge to the voir dire.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">III. VOIR DIRE</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">A. Facts Pertinent to Voir Dire</p>\n<p id=\"b74-8\">Appellant\u2019s proposed voir dire included questions about the NCR defense and pretrial publicity.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-9\">Regarding pretrial publicity, appellant asked the court to propound the following multi-part question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-10\">4A. Have any of you read, heard, or seen on TV, anything about the case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-11\">B. From where did you obtain your knowledge of the facts?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-12\">C. What did you hear?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-13\">D. As a result of what you heard about the case, have you formed any opinion as to the guilt or innocence of Mr. Logan or whether he was \u201cnot criminally responsible\u201d at the time of the alleged crimes?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-14\">E. What is your opinion?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-15\">F. In light of your pre-formed opinion do you believe you still could be fair and impartial and render a verdict based solely on the evidence?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b74-16\">After informing the venire panel briefly about the underlying facts, the court propounded the following question: \u201cDo any of you have any knowledge of what I\u2019ve just described, either personal knowledge, knowledge gained from conversations with other persons, or knowledge gained from the news media?\u201d At the bench, the court heard individually from those prospective jurors who responded affirmatively. When <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>informed by a prospective juror that he or she had either read or heard about the case from the news media, the court did not attempt to ascertain whether the prospective juror had formed an opinion about the case. Instead, the court asked: \u201cWould the fact that you\u2019ve heard about this matter prevent you from sitting as a juror and fairly and impartially trying this case?\u201d If the court again received an affirmative response, the court inquired further: \u201cYou think you would prejudge this [case]?\u201d In some instances, the court also inquired: \u201cIn other words, you would not be able to divorce what you\u2019ve heard about this?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">On some occasions, the court also asked one of the following questions: \u201cYour knowledge comes from what source?\u201d; \u201cIs that [i.e., your knowledge] from discussions with other persons or from the news media?\u201d; \u201cYou recall what news media it was?\u201d The court also told some of the venire: \u201cTell me what your personal knowledge is,\u201d or \u201cWhat did you read?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">Immediately following the court\u2019s inquiry about pretrial publicity, defense counsel objected to the court\u2019s failure to ask his proposed Question 4. The following exchange is pertinent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqf\">[COUNSEL FOR APPELLANT]: Your Honor, it seems to me, the question that we submitted on <em>voir dire </em>should be\u2014 I understand what you\u2019ve done. You run the show. But it seems to me it should be a 5-part question. Have you heard, seen, read or heard anything about the case and discussed it? What did you hear? As a result of what you\u2019ve heard or read, have you formed an opinion? What is that opinion and can you set that opinion aside? That\u2019s the classic 5-question <em>voir dire </em>on pretrial publicity. Your Honor is truncating it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-7\">THE COURT: They all indicated they can put aside whatever it is they heard and fairly and impartially try this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AzU\">[COUNSEL FOR APPELLANT]: I think under <em>Dingle [v. State, </em>361 Md. 1, 759 A.2d 819 (2000) ], that we\u2019re entitled to that 5-part question [sic] on death penalties, please, in regards to pretrial publicity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-8\">THE COURT: Okay. Go back and have a seat.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b76-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>(Emphasis added). The court did not ask any other questions relating to pretrial publicity.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">Appellant also asked the court to propound the following five-part question about the NCR defense:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-6\">7. Evidence will be produced during trial showing that the Defendant suffered from paranoid schizophrenia at the time of the crime. To that end, the defense will argue that the defendant was not criminally responsible at the time of the crime because, due to his mental disorder, he lacked substantial capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-7\">A. If the defendant satisfies his burden in this regard, will any member of the jury be unable to find the defendant not criminally responsible?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-8\">B. Does any juror anticipate having difficulty following the Court\u2019s instructions on the defense of \u201cnot criminally responsible,\u201d particularly in view of the crimes charged in the indictment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-9\">C. Has any member of the jury studied psychology or psychiatry?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-10\">D. Do you have any reservations or feelings that would prevent you from fairly considering the evidence in the case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-11\">E. In view of the defense of \u201cnot criminally responsible,\u201d does any member of the venire prefer not to sit on the case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-12\">The following exchange as to Question 7 is pertinent:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AvX\">[COUNSEL FOR APPELLANT]: [0]ne of our main concerns is our request number 7A through E, because we have a death penalty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-13\">THE COURT: I have a question on there about psychiatric and psychological training.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-14\">[COUNSEL FOR APPELLANT]: But nothing in regards to whether or not they would be willing, able to, in fact, allow a defense of insanity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-15\">THE COURT: Well, those have to do with the Court\u2019s instructions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-5\">[COUNSEL FOR APPELLANT]: At the appropriate time after the <em>voir dire, </em>we\u2019ll just list the questions that we object to....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">On voir dire, the court inquired: \u201cDo any of you ladies and gentlemen, or members of your immediate families have any experience, training, or education in the mental health field, such as psychiatry or psychology?\u201d When a prospective juror responded affirmatively, the court asked: \u201cWould that in any way prevent you from sitting as a juror in this case and rendering a fair and impartial verdict?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b77-8\">The court asked several other general questions during voir dire. These included: \u201cDo any of you have any religious, moral, philosophical or other personal reasons that would make it difficult for you to sit in judgment of another person?\u201d; \u201cDo any of you have any reason that I haven\u2019t already gone into why you believe that you could not sit as a juror in this case and render a fair and impartial verdict?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b77-9\">At the close of voir dire appellant\u2019s counsel renewed his objection to the court\u2019s refusal to ask his proposed Question 4, concerning pretrial publicity. He asserted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-10\">[W]e object and take exception to the Court\u2019s failure to give a number of our voir dire questions, but specifically, for the record, 4A through F which is a 5-part, actually a 6-part question in regards to pretrial publicity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-11\">Now, on those [of the jury panel] that did indicate that they had discussed the matter, you did ask a follow-up question as to whether they had formed an opinion. But it\u2019s our belief that the law is in any case where a juror \u2014 and I would note, for the record, three panels [of prospective jurors] \u2014 at least between 7 to 10 on each of the three panels came to the bench on questions dealing with pretrial publicity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-12\">Your practice was to ask a follow-up question with regards to their opinion if they had discussed it, but you did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>not ask a follow-up question on\u2019their opinion, whether they can set the opinion aside and what their opinion was in regards to those that had either read, heard newspaper accounts or TV accounts or radio accounts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-4\">We believe that the 6-part format on page 2 of our voir dire, which would be questions 4A through F, is what is legally required in those cases where a juror indicates that he has pretrial publicity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">Appellant\u2019s attorney also objected to the court\u2019s failure to ask his proposed Question 7. He stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-6\">[W]e take specific exceptions to ... 7A through E dealing with voir dire questions designed to test whether they [i.e., the prospective jurors] would be fair and impartial and could have a defense of not criminally responsible and evidence of paranoid schizophrenia and questions dealing with the burden of proof, et cetera. I know some of them were given with the actual instructional phase, but the questions we asked went beyond that. That\u2019s questions 7A through E. You gave one of them on whether they studied psychology or psychiatry. We think it should have been broader.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">B. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b78-8\">According to appellant, the court erred by failing to ferret out whether any of the prospective jurors harbored \u201cpotential biases towards an insanity defense.\u201d Noting that \u201c[t]he single, primary and overriding principle or purpose of voir dire is to ascertain the existence of cause for disqualification,\u201d appellant complains that the court compromised his right to a fair and impartial jury. Relying on a host of appellate decisions, including <em>Sweet v. State, </em>371 Md. 1, 806 A.2d 265 (2002), <em>State v. Thomas, </em>369 Md. 202, 798 A.2d 566 (2002), and <em>Dingle v. State, </em>361 Md. 1, 759 A.2d 819 (2000), appellant asserts: \u201cThe failure of the trial court to propound voir dire questions relating to Mr. Logan\u2019s defense of not criminally responsible rendered the voir dire process constitutionally inadequate to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>uncover potential bias\u201d concerning \u201cthe defense of insanity. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">Further, Logan argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-6\">Inasmuch as this case focused so centrally on Mr. Logan\u2019s claim that he was not criminally responsible for the killings, it was of paramount importance to determine whether any of the potential jurors harbored biases, preconceived notions, or such strong emotional reactions to a defense of \u201cinsanity\u201d that they would be incapable of applying, if found applicable, the defense of not criminally responsible in accordance with the trial court\u2019s' instructions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">Similarly, Logan complains that the court\u2019s \u201cquestioning on pretrial publicity was inadequate.\u201d Although appellant concedes that the Maryland appellate courts have not \u201cadopted any specific framework for questions regarding pretrial publicity,\u201d he maintains that, in light of the recent \u201cchange as to ... the depth of questioning of voir dire,\u201d the \u201ctrial court\u2019s voir dire on the issue of pretrial publicity ... was woefully inadequate.\u201d In appellant\u2019s view, the court\u2019s voir dire relating to pretrial publicity \u201camounted to little more than, bottom line questioning.\u201d Logan adds: \u201c[Njothing in the court\u2019s inquiry or the jurors\u2019 responses thereto shed any light whatsoever on the <em>nature </em>or <em>effect </em>of the exposure. All that was obtained by means of the court\u2019s inquiry was that several jurors had \u201cknowledge\u201d about the case and from what source.... \u201d According to Logan, by failing to make \u201ccritical inquiries\u201d about the content of the publicity to which a veniremember was exposed, and whether the potential juror had \u201cformed an opinion about the case,\u201d the court \u201cmissed the mark\u201d and \u201cdeprived Appellant of critical information that might lead to disqualification for cause.\u201d Moreover, he complains that the jurors were improperly required to assess for themselves whether they could serve fairly and impartially.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-8\">Appellant contends that the \u201c \u2018court should ask jurors what information they have received, ask responding jurors about the prejudicial effect of such information, and then independently determine whether such information has tainted jurors\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>impartiality.\u2019 \u201d (Quoting <em>United States v. Beckner, </em>69 F.3d 1290, 1291-92 (5th Cir.1995)). Noting that \u201c \u2018[j]urors are in a poor position to make determinations as to their own impartiality\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Beckner, </em>69 F.3d at 1293), appellant insists that the trial court\u2019s failure to conduct a more searching inquiry constituted reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">The State counters: \u201cDecisions about the extent of the voir dire procedure, as well as the specific questions to be asked on voir dire, generally fall within the sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d As to the court\u2019s rejection of appellant\u2019s proposed Question 7, relating to the NCR defense, the State argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AWX\">The refusal to ask this set of questions was not an abuse of discretion. Both this Court and the Court of Appeals have recognized that a trial court need not inquire on voir dire as to whether the jury can or will follow the court\u2019s instructions!;.] \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 Here, not only did [sub] questions one, two and five call for entirely speculative responses, they also were directed at matters inappropriate for voir dire. To adopt Logan\u2019s reasoning, any and all legal principles that might apply during the trial would need to be spelled out during voir dire for the purposes of eliciting the jurors\u2019 attitudes and responses thereto. Obviously, such an approach is untenable and not one contemplated by the voir dire process.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">Moreover, the State maintains that appellant\u2019s requested questions regarding his NCR defense were \u201ccovered by [other] voir dire questions posed by the court.\u201d It points out:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"As\">The court specifically asked the venire whether anyone among them had \u201cany experience, training, or education in the mental health field; specifically, psychiatry or psychology?\u201d The court further asked: [\u201cDo any of you have any religious, moral, philosophical or other personal reasons that would make it difficult for you to sit in judgment of another person?\u201d; \u201cDo any of you have any reason that I haven\u2019t already gone into why you believe that you could not sit as a juror in this case and render a fair and impartial verdict?\u201d] The venire knew that Logan was charged with killing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>Arnaud and Magruder and that he pled \u201cnot guilty and not criminally responsible.\u201d The scope of these questions were adequate to reveal any potential juror bias related to Logan\u2019s case.[]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">(Citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">As to appellant\u2019s contentions concerning pretrial publicity, the State maintains that the court\u2019s voir dire \u201cwas sufficient to adduce any potential juror bias emanating from a juror\u2019s exposure to pretrial publicity....\u201d It insists that \u201cany prospective juror who harbored pre-conceived notions or biases based on the exposure to pretrial publicity would have been detected by means of the voir dire questions actually posed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AFH\">According to the State, the court also utilized the proper methodology during voir dire, because it \u201cinquired whether any juror had acquired knowledge of the case,\u201d then \u201cquestioned [the venire] on the source of the information as to whether it would affect his or her ability to be impartial,\u201d and, finally, it \u201cindependently determined whether each responding juror could judge Logan impartially.\u201d As to both pretrial publicity and NCR, the State urges this Court not to expand the role of voir dire, stating: \u201cThere is simply no need or justification to expand the purpose or process of voir dire.\u201d It reminds us that it \u201cis for the Court of Appeals, not this Court,\u201d to decide that \u201ca well-established principle of law has become \u2018outmoded\u2019.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">It is well settled that the \u201coverriding principle or purpose\u201d of voir dire is to ascertain \u201c \u2018 \u201cthe existence of cause for disqualification.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Hill v. State, </em>339 Md. 275, 279, 661 A.2d 1164 (1995) (citations omitted); <em>see Thomas, supra, </em>369 Md. at 206, 798 A.2d 566; <em>Dingle, supra, </em>361 Md. at 9, 759 A.2d 819; <em>Boyd v. State, </em>341 Md. 431, 435, 671 A.2d 33 (1996). As this Court said in <em>Wilson v. State, </em>the \u201cpurpose of the <em>voir dire </em>process is to determine the prospective jurors\u2019 state of mind, and further, to ascertain whether the venire harbors any bias, prejudice, or preconception regarding the accused, a central matter in the case such as the crime, or any relevant collateral matter.\u201d 148 Md.App. 601, 658, 814 A.2d 1 (2002), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number><em>cert. denied, </em>374 Md. 84, 821 A.2d 371 (2003). <em>See Fowlkes v.

State, </em>157 Md.App. 600, 610, 853 A.2d 796 (2004); <em>see Hill, </em>339 Md. at 279, 661 A.2d 1164; <em>Perry v. State, </em>344 Md. 204, 218, 686 A.2d 274 (1996), <em>cert. denied, </em>520 U.S. 1146, 117 S.Ct. 1318, 137 L.Ed.2d 480 (1997). The Court of Appeals has recognized that questions that are \u201c \u2018speculative, inquisitorial, catechising, or \u201cfishing,\u201d asked in the aid of deciding on peremptory challenges, may be refused in the discretion of the court, even though it would not have been error to have asked them.\u2019 \u201d <em>Davis v. State, </em>333 Md. 27, 34, 633 A.2d 867 (1993) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">Notwithstanding the broad discretion afforded to the trial court in voir dire, there are \u201careas of inquiry that are mandatory,\u201d <em>Uzzle, supra, </em>152 Md.App. at 562, 832 A.2d 869, because they \u201cinvolve \u2018potential biases or predispositions that prospective jurors may hold which, if present, would hinder their ability to objectively resolve the matter before them.\u2019 \u201d <em>Dingle, </em>361 Md. at 10 n. 8, 759 A.2d 819 (citation omitted). The areas include \u201cracial, ethnic and cultural bias\u201d; \u201creligious bias\u201d; \u201cpredisposition as to the use of circumstantial evidence in capital cases\u201d; and \u201cplacement of undue weight on police officer credibility.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Questions beyond these required subjects must go \u201cdirectly to the question of juror bias and unequivocal disqualification.\u201d <em>Uzzle, </em>152 Md.App. at 562, 832 A.2d 869.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">When deciding whether to propound a question beyond one of the mandatory areas of inquiry, \u201cthe trial judge must assess whether there is a reasonable likelihood that a given line of inquiry will reveal a basis for disqualification.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 560, 832 A.2d 869. \u201cAbsent such a reasonable likelihood, there is no necessity to pursue the inquiry, notwithstanding the possibility that some conceivable basis for disqualification might be revealed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>To determine \u201crea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>sonable likelihood,\u201d the trial court should consider \u201cwhether a proposed inquiry is <em>reasonably </em>likely to reveal disqualifying partiality or bias,\u201d and should weigh \u201cthe expenditure of time and resources in the pursuit of the reason for the response to a proposed <em>voir dire </em>question against the likelihood that pursuing the reason for the response will reveal bias or partiality.\u201d <em>Perry, </em>344 Md. at 220, 686 A.2d 274 (emphasis in original); <em>see Uzzle, </em>152 Md.App. at 561, 832 A.2d 869.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">1. The NCR Defense</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">As noted, appellant maintains that his proposed questions relating to his NCR defense were integral to a determination of potential juror bias. The court only propounded a variation of appellant\u2019s proposed Question 7C; it merely inquired whether any of the prospective jurors or members of their immediate families had \u201cany experience, training, or education in the mental health field, such as psychiatry or psychology?\u201d While we do not endorse appellant\u2019s proposed phraseology in Question 7, it is noteworthy that the court did not refuse to propound Question 7 because of the form or phraseology. Nor did the court ask appellant\u2019s attorney to reformulate his questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">We pause to note that the form of the voir dire questions is \u201cclearly within the sound discretion of the court.\u201d <em>Casey v. Roman Catholic Archbishop of Baltimore, </em>217 Md. 595, 606, 143 A.2d 627 (1958). Even if appellant\u2019s questions were not well framed, however, it is clear that he sought to discover cause for disqualification based on bias towards an insanity defense. On that basis, if the court below was not satisfied with the form, it could have reformulated the questions or allowed defense counsel to do so. <em>See Cantee v. State, </em>223 Md. 575, 580, 165 A.2d 889 (1960) (concluding that the defendant \u201cwas denied an opportunity ... to frame additional proper <em>voir dire </em>questions ... and the court failed to ask, on its own motion, as it should have done, a proper question designed to ascertain the existence of cause for disqualification. ...\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b84-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>On the merits, we agree with Logan that the subject matter of the NCR defense was of considerable importance, and it should have been carefully explored on voir dire. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\"><em>Thomas, supra, </em>369 Md. 202, 798 A.2d 566, is instructive. In that case, the respondent was charged with possession and distribution of cocaine. On voir dire, the court refused to propound the following question proposed by the defendant: \u201c \u2018Does any member of the jury panel have such strong feelings regarding violations of the narcotics laws that it would be difficult for you to fairly and impartially weigh the facts at a trial where narcotics violations have been alleged?\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 204, 798 A.2d 566. This Court determined that the trial court abused its discretion and remanded for a new trial. <em>Id. </em>at 206, 798 A.2d 566. The Court of Appeals agreed. <em>Id. </em>at 204, 798 A.2d 566.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">Of import here, the Court concluded, <em>id. </em>at 212, 798 A.2d 566: \u201c[V]oir dire questions on drug attitudes \u2018are effective in revealing strong feelings towards narcotics laws that may hinder a juror\u2019s ability to serve.\u2019 \u201d (Citation omitted). It reasoned, <em>id. </em>at 207, 213-14, 798 A.2d 566:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-6\"><em>\u201c[T]he questions [on voir dire] should focus on issues particular to the defendant\u2019s case so that biases directly related to the crime, the mtnesses, or the defendant may be uncovered. . . . </em>\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-7\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-8\">As we have seen, and so often reiterated, the single, primary, and overriding principle or purpose of voir dire is to ascertain \u201c \u2018the existence of cause for disqualification[,]\u2019 \u201d ... and this is accomplished through the pursuit of one of the two mandatory areas of inquiry, <em>i.e., </em>\u201can examination of a jury ... conducted strictly -within the right to discover the state of mind of the juror in respect to the matter in hand or any collateral matter reasonably liable to unduly influence him.\u2019 \u201d ... We have been emphatic, even in civil cases, that \u201ca party is entitled to a jury free of all disqualifying bias or prejudice without exception, and not merely a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>jury free of bias or prejudice of a general or abstract nature.\u201d ... And, although we have entrusted the trial court with considerable discretion, we have admonished:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AO\">\u201c \u2018In the exercise of that discretion, the trial judge should adapt the questions to the needs of each case in the effort to secure an impartial jury.

Accordingly an examination of a juror on his voir dire is proper as long as it is conducted within the right to discover the juror\u2019s state of mind in respect to the matter in hand or any collateral matter reasonably liable to unduly influence him.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-5\"><em>A question aimed at uncovering a venire person\u2019s bias because of the nature of the crime with which the defendant is charged is directly relevant to, and focuses on, an issue particular to the defendant\u2019s case and, so should be uncovered. ... </em>We agree with the intermediate appellate court: the proposed voir dire question should have been asked.

State, supra, </em>371 Md. 1, 806 A.2d 265, also provides guidance. There, the petitioner was convicted of second degree assault and third degree sexual offense of a minor. <em>Id. </em>at 3, 4, 806 A.2d 265. The Court of Appeals granted certiorari to consider, <em>inter alia, </em>whether the trial court erred in refusing to pose the following voir dire question requested by the defendant: \u201cDo the charges stir up strong emotional feelings in you that would affect your ability to be fair and impartial in this case?\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 3, 9, 806 A.2d 265. The Court concluded \u201cthat the trial court abused its discretion in failing to pose [the] requested <em>voir dire </em>question.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 10, 806 A.2d 265. Adopting its reasoning in <em>Thomas, </em>369 Md. 202, 798 A.2d 566, the Court agreed that the petitioner\u2019s proposed question \u201cwas directed at biases, specifically those related to [the] alleged criminal act, that, if uncovered, would be disqualifying when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>they impaired the ability of the juror to be fair and impartial.\u201d <em>Sweet, </em>371 Md. at 10, 806 A.2d 265.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">The State points to our recent decision in <em>Baker, supra, </em>157 Md.App. 600, 853 A.2d 796, for the proposition that a reversal here would amount to a decision that the reasoning of the Court of Appeals in <em>Twining v.

As we see it, the State\u2019s reliance on <em>Twining </em>is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">In <em>Twining, </em>234 Md. at 100, 198 A.2d 291, the Court of Appeals found no abuse of discretion by the trial court in refusing to ask whether the venire \u201cwould give the accused the benefit of the presumption of innocence and the burden of proof.\u201d Notably, the Court said: \u201cThe rules of law stated in the proposed questions were fully and fairly covered in the subsequent instructions to the jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 100, 198 A.2d 291. The Court added: \u201cIt is generally recognized that it is inappropriate to instruct on the law at [the voir dire] stage of the case, or to question the jury as to whether or not they would be disposed to follow or apply stated rules of law.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">In <em>Baker, </em>157 Md.App. 600, 853 A.2d 796, the appellant was charged with assault and use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence. <em>Id. </em>at 604, 853 A.2d 796. At trial, the appellant did not deny that he shot the victim, but claimed that he acted in self-defense and to defend his girlfriend. <em>Id. </em>After the jury convicted the appellant of all charges, he noted an appeal. <em>Id. </em>He argued, <em>inter alia, </em>that the trial court erred by rejecting the following voir dire question: \u201c[D]o you have any bias or prejudice concerning handguns which would prevent you from fairly weighing the evidence in this case[?]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 608, 853 A.2d 796.

One of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>the facts the jury might have to decide was whether appellant used reasonable force. <em>The trial court should have asked whether any prospective juror had strong feelings about handguns that would have affected his or her ability to weigh the issues fairly.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b87-4\">157 Md.App. at 613, 853 A.2d 796 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">On the other hand, we rejected the appellant\u2019s claim in <em>Baker </em>that the trial court erred by failing to ask the venire if they would draw an inference of guilt if the defendant elected not to testify. <em>Id. </em>at 615-16, 853 A.2d 796. We concluded that the court \u201cwas not required to ask jurors whether they would draw an inference from the defendant\u2019s election not to testify.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 616, 853 A.2d 796. In reaching that conclusion, the <em>Baker </em>Court looked to <em>Twining, supra, </em>234 Md. 97, 198 A.2d 291, in which the Court of Appeals determined that the trial court need not ask the venire whether they would follow the court\u2019s instructions as to the law. <em>Baker, </em>157 Md.App. at 616, 853 A.2d 796. Adhering to <em>Twining, </em>the <em>Baker </em>Court declined to require voir dire questions aimed at determining whether the venire would abide by the court\u2019s instructions on the rules of law. <em>Id. </em>at 616, 853 A.2d 796. Although we recognized that other jurisdictions \u201chave reached a different conclusion,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 617, 853 A.2d 796, we said: \u201c[l]t is up to the Court of Appeals, not this Court, to decide ... that the reasoning of <em>Twining </em>is \u2018now outmoded.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 618, 853 A.2d 796 (citation omitted in Baker).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">The above discussion leads us to conclude that appellant was not entitled to voir dire Questions 7A and 7B. Under <em>Twining, </em>Questions 7A and 7B were not proper voir dire inquiries, because they pertained to whether prospective jurors would apply the rules of law as instructed by the court. But, Question 7 was not limited in scope to whether the prospective jurors would follow the court\u2019s instructions on the law. To the contrary, the central theme of Question 7 was aimed at ascertaining whether the venire harbored a bias towards an NCR defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>We are mindful that the questions requested <em>in Thomas </em>and <em>Sweet </em>related to the crimes with which the defendant was charged, while here, as in <em>Baker, </em>Question 7 pertained to appellant\u2019s <em>defense. </em>Having conceded that he shot the sheriffs, Logan\u2019s entire defense hinged on his claim that he lacked criminal responsibility because of his deranged mental state. Therefore, questions regarding the venire\u2019s views toward the NCR defense were crucial to the determination of whether there was cause for disqualification.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">In connection with appellant\u2019s NCR defense, the jury had to determine whether he suffered from a mental illness that negated his criminal responsibility. Some members of the venire might have been disdainful of an NCR defense, particularly in the context of the shooting deaths of two law enforcement officers who were killed in the line of duty. Precisely because the subject matter of an NCR defense is a controversial one, the trial court should have inquired whether any prospective jurors had reservations or strong feelings regarding such a defense. What we said in <em>Gregory v. State, </em>40 Md.App. 297, 326, 391 A.2d 437 (1978), in the context of cross-examination, seems equally applicable to voir dire:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-5\">Psychiatry \u2014 particularly the forensic branch of it \u2014 is an inexact science. <em>See New York Life Ins. Co. v. Taylor, </em>147 F.2d 297, 304 (D.C.Cir.1945), opinion on rehearing. One need do no more than peruse the reported appellate opinions touching upon the issue of a criminal defendant\u2019s \u201csanity\u201d to see the frequency with which well-qualified and presumably competent practitioners express different \u2014 and sometimes widely varying \u2014 opinions concerning that critical issue. Considering the less-than-certain and ever shifting state of the art, these opinions, given their ultimate potential effect, cry out for cross-examination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">Although we have not found an appellate case in Maryland discussing voir dire with respect to an NCR defense, cases outside Maryland help to elucidate our concern. We pause to consider them.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>In <em>People v.

At trial, over the defendant\u2019s objection, several potential jurors were asked about their views of criminal responsibility in the context of felony murder principles, because the defendant was not the alleged shooter. <em>Id. </em>219 Ill.Dec. 174, 670 N.E.2d at 855. The Illinois appellate court determined that the court erred in allowing the questions, but concluded that the error was harmless. <em>Id. </em>219 Ill.Dec. 174, 670 N.E.2d at 860. In reaching its conclusion as to the voir dire, the <em>Mapp </em>court noted that, \u201c[ojrdinarily, ... questions concerning a specific defense will be excluded.\u201d <em>Id. </em>219 Ill.Dec. 174, 670 N.E.2d at 857.

The court explained, <em>id:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-5\">Why questions about the insanity defense but not compulsion or self-defense? The [Illinois] Supreme Court supplied the answer: \u201c * * * <em>the jury was going to be asked to apply an extraordinarily controversial legal requirement against which many members of the community may have been prejudiced.\u201d ... </em>That is, <em>the insanity defense is a \u201csubject of intense controversy, </em>\u201d and simply asking jurors whether they could faithfully apply the law as instructed was not enough to reveal juror bias and prejudice toward that defense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">(Citations omitted) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\"><em>People v.

There, the defendant was convicted of the murders of his wife and infant son. At trial, he admitted to the killings, but claimed he was insane at the time. <em>Id. </em>97 Ill.Dec. 676, 493 N.E.2d at 340. The jury rejected the defense. <em>Id. </em>The Illinois appellate court reversed the conviction on several grounds, including that the trial judge erred in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>refusing to ask the potential jurors various questions relating to the insanity defense. <em>Id. </em>97 Ill.Dec. 676, 493 N.E.2d at 343. Specifically, the defendant proposed the following questions, <em>id.:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-5\">1. Have you or anyone close to you had any experience with a psychiatrist or psychologist?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-6\">2. Do you agree with the concept that a person should not be held responsible for his acts if he is not capable of conforming his conduct to the requirements of the law?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-7\">3. Can you find someone not guilty by reason of insanity?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-8\">4. Do you have any feeling or viewpoint concerning the defense of insanity in a criminal case? If so, what?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-9\">Of the four questions, the trial court only asked the first. <em>Id. </em>The Illinois Supreme Court agreed that the trial court properly rejected the second and third questions because they were \u201cvague and improperly phrased.\u201d <em>Id. </em>But, the court held that the fourth question, which inquired into whether the venirepersons had any feelings or viewpoints concerning an insanity defense, was proper and should have been asked, because it \u201cdoes not attempt to state the law but merely probes for bias----\u201d <em>Id. </em>97 Ill.Dec. 676, 493 N.E.2d at 344.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-11\">The <em>Stack </em>court looked to other Illinois cases that held that questions concerning the prospective jurors\u2019 attitudes and viewpoints on other subjects, such as the death penalty, were proper on voir dire. <em>Id. </em>The court stated, <em>id.:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-12\">The thread which runs through those cases is that <em>the jury was going to be asked to apply an extraordinarily controversial legal requirement against which many members of the community may have been prejudiced.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-13\"><em>Although the insanity defense upon which the defendant relied is a well-recognized legal defense, it remains a subject of intense controversy. </em>In <em>People v.

Frederiksen, </em>40 Wash.App. 749, 700 P.2d 369, <em>review denied, </em>104 Wash.2d 1013 (1985), is also informative. There, the appellant was convicted of second degree assault while armed with a deadly weapon and a firearm. <em>Id. </em>at 371. On appeal, he contended, <em>inter alia, </em>that the trial court erred in rejecting his proposed voir dire questions regarding the prospective jurors\u2019 attitudes toward self-defense. <em>Id. </em>at 370. The appellate court disagreed and affirmed the conviction. <em>Id. </em>at 374.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">The <em>Frederiksen </em>Court concluded that \u201cself-defense in general did not fall within any of the three classes raising a real possibility of bias.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 372.

Appellant relies on <em>Dingle </em>to support his claim of error as to the form of the court\u2019s questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">In <em>Dingle, supra, </em>361 Md. 1, 759 A.2d 819, the petitioner was indicted for robbery with a dangerous and deadly weapon and related charges and sought various voir dire questions concerning whether any of the venirepersons had certain experiences or associations. <em>Id. </em>at 3, 759 A.2d 819. Although the court asked the petitioner\u2019s questions, it joined, as part of a compound question, \u201can inquiry into whether the experience or association posited would affect the prospective jury\u2019s ability to be fair and impartial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 3-4, 759 A.2d 819. The court instructed the prospective jurors that, if their answers to both parts of the question were in the negative, then they did not need to approach the bench and reveal their answers. <em>Id. </em>at 4, 759 A.2d 819.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">The Court of Appeals concluded, <em>id. </em>at 8-9, 759 A.2d 819, that the petitioner was entitled to a new trial because \u201cthe voir dire procedure ... usurped the court\u2019s responsibility\u201d of impaneling the jury and determining, \u201cin the final analysis, the fitness of the individual venire persons.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 8, 759 A.2d 819. Writing for the Court, Chief Judge Bell reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AF_\">[V]oir dire, whether in a capital case or in the more usual situation, to be meaningful, must uncover more than \u201cthe jurorsf] bottom line conclusions [to broad questions], which do not in themselves reveal automatically disqualifying biases as to their ability fairly and accurately to decide the case, and, indeed, which do not elucidate the bases for those conclusions.... \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-6\">* * :|c</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-7\">Confession by a venire person is one way of establishing bias, but it is not the only way; \u201cthe strike for cause process encompasses the situation where the motion to strike is made on the basis of information developed during the voir dire process, not simply where the prospective juror admits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>an inability to be fair and impartial.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>333 Md. at 63, 633 A.2d at 885 (Bell, J. dissenting).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-4\">[I]n those cases where the venire person has had the questioned experience or association, but believes he or she can be fair, the procedure followed in this case shifts from the trial judge to the venire responsibility to decide juror bias. Without information bearing on the relevant experiences or association of the affected individual venire persons who were not required to respond, the court simply does not have the ability, and therefore, is unable to evaluate whether such persons are capable of conducting themselves impartially. Moreover, the petitioner is deprived of the ability to challenge any of those persons for cause. Rather than advancing the purpose of voir dire, the form of the challenged inquiries in this case distorts and frustrates it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A2b\"><em>Id. </em>at 15, 21, 759 A.2d 819 (Citation omitted) (alteration in Dingle).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-5\">Moreover, the Court reiterated that the trial court has the responsibility to decide, based upon the circumstances then existing, <em>i.e. </em>\u201cin addition to the venire person\u2019s bottom line conclusion in that regard, as reflected in the answers he or she gives, the character and duration of the position, the venire person\u2019s demeanor, and any and all other relevant circumstances,\u201d or, in other words, whether any of the venire persons occupying the questioned status or having the questioned experiences should be discharged for cause, or whether \u201ca demonstrably strong correlation [exists] between the status [or experience] in question and a mental state that gives rise to cause for disqualification.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">361 Md. at 17, 759 A.2d 819 (citation omitted) (alterations in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">We agree with the State that <em>Dingle </em>is factually distinguishable from this case. Here, the court did not ask two-part compound questions that required the potential juror to approach only if he or she answered yes to both parts of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>question. Rather, the court first identified the veniremembers who heard about the case and then individually questioned each potential juror to determine the source of the information and whether the information would affect his or her ability to act fairly and impartially.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">Nevertheless, we agree with appellant that the court should have asked some variation of his proposed Question 4D, which inquired directly of the jurors who had been exposed to pretrial publicity whether they had formed an opinion about the case based on such exposure. Instead, the court inquired whether the jurors believed they could serve fairly and impartially. The court\u2019s question sought to uncover the jurors\u2019 own \u201cbottom line conclusions\u201d as to their impartiality. <em>Dingle, </em>361 Md. at 15, 759 A.2d 819. Put another way, in instances when the prospective juror responded that he or she could be impartial, despite the exposure to pretrial publicity, the court\u2019s inquiry ended. In effect, the court shifted to the venire its \u201cresponsibility to decide juror bias.\u201d <em>Dingle, </em>361 Md. at 21, 759 A.2d 819. In light of the gravity of this case, we do not have a \u201creasonable assurance that prejudice would be discovered if present.\u201d <em>White v. State, supra, </em>374 Md. at 242, 821 A.2d 459.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">We disagree with appellant, however, that the court was obligated to ask proposed Question 4C, which inquired into the nature or content of the pretrial publicity to which the juror had been exposed. In <em>Mu\u2019Min v. Virginia, </em>500 U.S. 415, 111 S.Ct. 1899, 114 L.Ed.2d 493, <em>rehearing den., </em>501 U.S. 1269, 112 S.Ct. 13, 115 L.Ed.2d 1097 (1991), the United States Supreme Court, in a 5-4 decision, rejected the notion that questions regarding the content of pretrial publicity were constitutionally required. <em>Id. </em>at 422, 111 S.Ct. 1899. Chief Justice Rehnquist, writing on behalf of the majority, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AXA\">Whether a trial court decides to put questions about the content of publicity to a potential juror or not, it must make the same decision at the end of the questioning: is this juror to be believed when he says he has not formed an opinion about the case? <em>Questions about the content of the publici</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number><em>ty to which jurors have been exposed might be helpful </em>in assessing whether a juror is impartial. <em>To be constitutionally compelled, however, it is not enough that such questions might be helpful. </em>Rather, the trial court\u2019s failure to ask these questions must render the defendant\u2019s trial fundamentally unfair.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b95-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 425-26, 111 S.Ct. 1899 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">IV. REMAINING ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"AVn\">A. Right to Confrontation</p>\n<p id=\"A5o\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">As noted, appellant presented three expert witnesses to establish his NCR defense. One of those experts, Joanna Brandt, M.D., was accepted at trial, as a defense expert in general and forensic psychiatry. She testified that appellant suffered from \u201cschizophrenia, paranoid type\u201d and \u201ccocaine dependence and cannabis dependence.\u201d Further, she opined that appellant was not criminally responsible for his actions at the time of the shootings.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-8\">On direct examination, Dr. Brandt explained that, in reaching her diagnosis, she reviewed the diagnosis of Dr. Mattie White, the detention center psychiatrist who evaluated appellant while he was incarcerated. Dr. White\u2019s diagnosis was contained in the detention center medical records, which were accepted into evidence at trial as a defense exhibit. According to Dr. Brandt, Dr. White diagnosed appellant as having a \u201cdrug induced psychotic disorder, rule out bipolar disorder .... \u201d Dr. White did not testify, however.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-9\">On cross-examination, and over objection from appellant\u2019s counsel, the State questioned Dr. Brandt as to whether Dr. White diagnosed appellant \u201cas paranoid schizophrenic.\u201d Appellant argued that such testimony violated his Sixth Amendment right to confrontation. The State countered that appellant waived his objection by eliciting Dr. White\u2019s opinion through Dr. Brandt\u2019s testimony on direct examination. The court denied appellant\u2019s objection, noting that, in answering <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>the State\u2019s question, Dr. Brandt would not be going beyond the contents of Dr. White\u2019s records, which had been previously accepted into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">Appellant renews his claim of error based on confrontation grounds. According to appellant: \u201cUnder both <em>Gregory [v. State, supra, </em>40 Md.App. 297, 391 A.2d 437], and <em>Crawford [v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004) ], Mr. Logan\u2019s right of confrontation was violated because there was no showing that [the] declarant was unavailable, and could not have been presented at trial by the State and subjected to cross-examination by defense counsel.\u201d The State counters: \u201cHaving affirmatively introduced the Detention Center\u2019s medical records, including Dr. White\u2019s diagnosis, into evidence, and having also elicited testimony from Dr. Brandt regarding conclusions contained in those records, [appellant] should not now be heard to complain about the State\u2019s limited inquiry into the same subject on cross-examination.\u201d Moreover, the State argues that, even if Dr. Brandt\u2019s testimony relating to the contents of the detention center medical records constituted hearsay, it was admissible under Md. Rule 5-803(b)(7), \u201cwhich excepts from the hearsay rule the absence of an entry in records of regularly conducted business activity where such an absence is of a kind about which such records were regularly made and preserved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">We decline to address this issue, because it may not arise on remand. First, we do not know whether appellant will introduce the medical records that generated the issue. Second, the parties may opt to call Dr. White, which would obviate the concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">Moreover, the court below did not have the benefit of <em>Crawford, </em>which was decided in March of 2004, four months after the trial. Since then, this Court has decided <em>Rollins v. State, </em>161 Md.App. 34, 866 A.2d 926, <em>cert. granted, </em>387 Md. 462, 875 A.2d 767 (2005), and <em>Snowden v. State, </em>156 Md.App. 139, 846 A.2d 36 (2004), <em>aff'd, </em>385 Md. 64, 867 A.2d 314 (2005), which are also relevant. On remand, in the event that the issue again arises, the court and the parties will have the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>opportunity to consider the issue in light of the cases mentioned above.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\">B. Jury Instructions</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">Appellant raises numerous objections to the court\u2019s instructions to the jury. Specifically, he argues that the court erred in failing to give (1) an instruction about \u201csettled or fixed insanity\u201d; (2) a modified version of the pattern jury instruction on NCR, stating that to \u201cappreciate\u201d the criminality of one\u2019s conduct means more than to \u201cknow\u201d that one\u2019s conduct is criminal; and (3) an instruction regarding the distinction between intent and criminal responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">Because we have vacated appellant\u2019s conviction, we decline to address appellant\u2019s objections to the court\u2019s instructions. <em>See Darby v. State, </em>45 Md.App. 585, 595, 414 A.2d 248 (1980) (where Court reversed convictions after it held that the circuit court erred in failing to suppress the appellant\u2019s confession, it stated: \u201cAs reversal of appellant\u2019s conviction is mandated by this determination, we shall decline to address further the alleged error in the court\u2019s instructions\u201d); <em>see also Jones v. State, </em>280 Md. 282, 288, 372 A.2d 1064 (1977) (\u201cIn light of our decision that there must be a new trial, we need not decide whether the court applied the correct burden of proof on finding appellant competent ...\u201d); <em>Hadid v. Alexander, </em>55 Md.App. 344, 354, 462 A.2d 1216 (declining to reach another of appellant\u2019s issues where Court determined \u201cpreviously that reversible error has been committed\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>297 Md. 310 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">JUDGMENT VACATED.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">CASE REMANDED TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR PRINCE GEORGE\u2019S COUNTY FOR NEW TRIAL.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-9\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY PRINCE GEORGE\u2019S COUNTY.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b29-9\">. On June 16, 2003, the State filed a notice of its intent to seek the death penalty. At the hearing, the court also heard argument as to numerous motions relating to the capital sentencing phase, which are not at issue here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b29-10\">. This Court granted appellant's request to file a brief beyond the 35-page limit provided in Md. Rule 8~503(d). We subsequently granted the State\u2019s request for the same privilege.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b29-11\">. <em>See Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b31-8\">. Numerous witnesses testified over the course of the two-week trial that began on October 23, 2003. Our summary will focus on the evidence central to the issues on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b33-9\">. Appellant also asserted that he \u201cwas suffering from a mental illness at the time he was interrogated,\u201d and \"was in no mental or physical condition to make a voluntary statement.\u201d Further, he claimed that his right to counsel under the Fifth and Sixth Amendment was violated during interrogation, rendering his statements inadmissible. On appeal, however, Logan pursues only the alleged <em>Miranda </em>violation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b33-10\">. Appellant's Brief includes a \"Statement of the Facts\u201d pertinent to trial, but does not include a summary of the facts adduced at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>suppression hearing. Our review of the trial court's ruling with respect to a suppression motion is based solely on the record of the suppression hearing. <em>Dashiell v. State, </em>374 Md. 85, 93, 821 A.2d 372 (2003); <em>Cooper v. State, </em>163 Md.App. 70, 84, 877 A.2d 1095 (2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b35-9\">. A videotape and a DVD recording of the interview were admitted into evidence, without objection. The portions that were played at the suppression hearing were transcribed in the record. The transcript itself was not introduced until the trial, however. By Order dated January 25, 2005, we directed the circuit court to transmit these exhibits to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-10\">At the suppression hearing, the court agreed that the DVD \u201cis the best evidence,\u201d and noted that it had \"listened to it a couple of times.\u201d Nevertheless, because the transcript contains, in written form, the content of the recordings, v/e have relied on the transcript.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b35-11\">. We have no document indicating the precise time that the interview began. We rely on Canales\u2019s testimony that, at 4:05 a.m., he began to explain \"what's going to happen.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b49-9\">. At the outset, appellant's counsel set forth the various grounds upon which appellant sought suppression, most of which are not pursued on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b49-10\">[One,] <em>Miranda </em>advice and waiver. Two, voluntariness. Three, <em>Lowdowski, </em>right to counsel Fifth Amendment. We\u2019re also going to be arguing right to counsel Sixth Amendment and we\u2019re going to throw in the cite of <em>McCarther v. State., </em>the Public Defender law, Article 27, Section 4 which is the broader right to counsel under federal law.[1]</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b54-11\">. Because appellant appeals only from the court\u2019s denial of suppression on <em>Miranda </em>grounds, we need not recount the court's reasoning as to other grounds.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b56-6\">. We pause to note that appellant does not rely on <em>Missouri v. Seibert, </em>542 U.S. 600, 124 S.Ct. 2601, 159 L.Ed.2d 643 (2004), which was decided several weeks before appellant filed his opening brief in this matter. In <em>Seibert, </em>the Supreme Court held that, when a two-step interrogation strategy is deliberately used, in which the police purposefully withhold <em>Miranda </em>warnings until after an incriminating statement is made, then give proper <em>Miranda </em>warnings, secure a proper waiver, and elicit a second confession, the second confession must be suppressed because a \"midstream recitation of warnings after interrogation and unwarned confession could not effectively comply with <em>Miranda\u2019s </em>constitutional requirement....\u201d 124 S.Ct. at 2605; <em>see also Cooper, supra, </em>at 73, 877 A.2d 1095.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">Appellant does not claim error in the timing of the advisement, nor does he argue that the background inquiry was part of one continuous interrogation. Moreover, Logan does not suggest that Canales intentionally primed appellant with seemingly innocuous questions and comments in the background phase to induce him to waive <em>Miranda. </em>Significantly, unlike in <em>Seibert, </em>in which the police engaged in a deliberate strategy, appellant\u2019s counsel argued below: \"I\u2019m not saying [Canales] did it deliberately.... It's irrelevant whether he thought he was doing anything wrong.\u201d Furthermore, the court below never found that Canales deliberately engaged in an improper strategy as a ploy to induce the waiver of rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-8\">For these reasons, we shall not consider <em>Seibert </em>or <em>Cooper </em>in our analysis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b61-7\">. In <em>Winder, </em>362 Md. at 307, 765 A.2d 97, the Court explained:</p>\n<p id=\"b61-8\">In cases where we are called upon to determine whether a confession has been made voluntarily, we generally look at the totality of the circumstances affecting the interrogation and confession.... We look to all of the elements of the interrogation to determine whether a suspect's confession was given to the police through the exercise of free will or was coerced through the use of improper means. On the non-exhaustive list of facts we consider are the length of the interrogation, the manner in which it was conducted, the number of police officers present throughout the interrogation, and the age, education and experience of the suspect.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-9\">(Citations omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b67-7\">. We note that in <em>Cooper v. State, supra, </em>this Court disagreed with <em>Cohen, </em>but on an issue not pertinent here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
