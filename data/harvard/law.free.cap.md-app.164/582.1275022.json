Subse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>quently, after merging one of the third degree sexual offense convictions, the court sentenced appellant to twenty years\u2019 imprisonment for the attempted second degree rape conviction, a concurrent term of fifteen years\u2019 imprisonment for the child abuse conviction, and a ten-year suspended sentence for the remaining third degree sexual offense conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-4\">On appeal, appellant contends that (1) the court erred in admitting out-of-court statements by the victim because it violated his Sixth Amendment right to confront witnesses, (2) the court erred in admitting testimony regarding other crimes in violation of Rule 5-404(b), and (3) the evidence was legally insufficient to sustain the conviction for attempted second degree rape. With respect to the first issue, the objection in circuit court was on the ground of hearsay. Subsequent to trial and conviction, the Supreme Court decided <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004), and appellant now argues a violation of the Confrontation Clause. We hold that the first issue was not preserved for review because the only ground stated below was hearsay, and we decline to recognize plain error. Perceiving no error with respect to the second issue, and holding as to the third issue that the evidence was legally sufficient, we shall affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">We shall quote the relevant facts, as set forth in appellant\u2019s brief, omitting citations to the record. We will supplement the facts contained in appellant\u2019s brief as necessary.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-7\">Kelly Collins, the wife of appellant, testified that in September of 2002, she took her 8-year-old daughter, [K], to the hospital [<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>]. Ms. Collins explained that she took her daughter to the hospital because she \u201cnoticed [K] was very red in her vaginal area.\u201d According to Ms. Collins, this discovery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>\u201cbrought back everything that [she] had forgotten about and [she] decided it was time to turn [appellant] in for molesting [her] daughter.\u201d Ms. Collins explained that what she had \u201cforgotten about\u201d was that she had caught appellant allegedly molesting [K][sic] on two prior occasions. According to Ms. Collins, nearly two years earlier she witnessed [K] \u201cbent over the kitchen chair with her pants down----[Appellant] was behind her with his penis out between her legs.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Nearly a year after the incident in the kitchen, according to Ms. Collins, she observed appellant and [K] on the couch. [<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>] Ms. Collins explained that [K] \u201chad her pants pulled down,\u201d and appellant \u201cwas in the process of pulling his shorts down.\u201d Ms. Collins testified that she did not report these incidents because she felt threatened by appellant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AUn\">Ms. Susan Holian, a sexual forensic examiner (SAFE) nurse, testified that she examined [K] on October 1, 2002. Ms. Holian reported redness of the \u201cexternal and internal genitalia,\u201d and explained that \u201cby internal, that\u2019s the area right before the vaginal hole.\u201d Ms. Holian further reported that [K]\u2019s hymen was intact, indicating a lack of vaginal penetration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aff\">Ms. Penny Boccelli, a social worker for the Harford County Department of Social Services, testified that she interviewed [K] on October 3, 2002. Ms. Boccelli testified that the interview was conducted at the Child Advocacy Center in the presence of a police detective and was recorded on videotape. Ms. Boccelli explained that a copy of the videotape was made for the police detective as \u201cpart of their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>criminal evidence.\u201d The videotape of Ms. Boccelli\u2019s interview with [K] was entered, into evidence and played for the jury. During the interview, [K] explained that appellant touched her \u201cpee-pee.\u201d She told Ms. Boccelli that he put his \u201cpee-pee\u201d on her \u201cpee-pee.\u201d [K] further told Ms. Boccelli that this type of contact occurred on two prior occasions. Once in the kitchen, and once on the couch.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-5\">Mr. James Hanna, appellant\u2019s step-father, also testified for the State. He testified that on September 30, 2002, he received a phone call from Ms. Collins, who told him she was taking [K] to the hospital. Mr. Hanna testified that as a result of that phone call, he went to the home of appellant and Ms. Collins. He explained that when he arrived, he witnessed appellant and Ms. Collins arguing, and heard appellant say \u201cthat nothing had happened that week\u00e9nd, it was all in the past, there was no penetration.\u201d '</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-6\">Appellant testified on his own behalf, and expressly denied ever having \u201cany sort of sexual activity\u201d with [K], Moreover, Dr. Kent Hymel, a pediatric physician and expert in sexual child abuse examination, testified that \u201credness and tenderness are completely non-specific findings.\u201d Dr. Hymel stated that such findings \u201ccannot or should not be specifically related to sexual assault, because there are multiple other even more common explanations for redness and tenderness.\u201d Dr. Hymel explained that such symptoms may, for example, be the result of \u201csimple skin irritation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">On January 5, 2004, after jury selection but prior to opening statements, the court interviewed [K] in chambers. Subsequently, the court heard arguments in regard to the State\u2019s motion to introduce the videotaped interview between [K] and Ms. Boccelli, pursuant to Md.Code (2001), \u00a7 11-304 of the Criminal Procedure Article. The following colloquy pertinent to this appeal ensued.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-8\">THE STATE: Your Honor, the State is making a motion to have the videotaped testimony \u2014 or the videotaped interview of the victim in this case, I K], introduced into trial and to be produced in lieu of live testimony. We\u2019ve had the child interviewed in chambers by Your Honor, and I\u2019ve talked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>with defense counsel, and the precedent under 11-304 ... is that an out-of-court statement may be admissible if made to a person who is acting lawfully in the course of her profession and is a licensed social worker, and Miss [Boccelli] is so, and I have talked to defense counsel and he has stated he would stipulate to the fact that she was acting lawfully in her profession and was licensed at the time, but if need be, for the court\u2019s purposes, I can put her on the stand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ACZ\">APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL [<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>]: I would stipulate to that, Your Honor, and that she is currently a licensed social worker as well.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-5\">THE COURT: All right, so what you\u2019re doing, then, is offering this video as an out-of-court statement of a child victim, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-6\">THE STATE: Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-7\">* * <em>*</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-8\">THE COURT: And the child in this case is not going to testify; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-9\">THE STATE: Not if she doesn\u2019t have to. Well, no, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-10\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-11\">THE COURT: And we\u2019re here for the purpose of a hearing to make a determination as to particularized guarantees of trustworthiness [pursuant to \u00a7 11 \u2014 304(e)]; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AFS\">THE STATE: That is true, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-12\">APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL: That\u2019s correct, Your Honor, and under (f), Your Honor will need to make a finding on the record as to the specific guarantees of trustworthiness that are in the statement and determine the admissibility of the statement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b612-13\">Subsequently, the videotaped interview was played for the court. Both before and after the videotape was played, appellant\u2019s counsel argued that the videotape did not meet the \u201cparticularized guarantees of trustworthiness\u201d requirements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>of section ll-304(e), focusing predominantly on (e)(xii), which mandates that the court consider \u201cwhether the statement was suggested by the use of leading questions.\u201d At no time did appellant object to the videotape on the grounds that it violated his right to confrontation under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article 21 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b613-4\">On January 6, 2004, the court ruled on the State\u2019s motion. In so doing, it stated the following with regard to section 11-304(e).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-5\">Subsection (c) requires that the out-of-court statement is admissible only if it\u2019s made to and offered by a person acting lawfully in the course of that person\u2019s profession, and one of the professions listed would be a licensed social worker, and that in fact is the case here. It\u2019s also a videotape being made through the licensed social worker, but it is in fact a video presentation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-6\">The court also must find that there are particularized guarantees of trustworthiness pursuant to subsection (e). Keeping in mind that the issue of trustworthiness of the statement and the degree of probative value are two different items, in this particular instance I\u2019m looking at this only to see if I believe that the child\u2019s statement has some indication of, or guarantees of, trustworthiness, and subsection (2) of subsection (e) sets out the various factors which the court must examine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-7\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-8\">\u201cWhether the statement was spontaneous or directly responsive to questions.\u201d Well, in this particular case the statement was almost entirely made pursuant to and responsive to questions asked by the social worker.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-9\">\u00a1Is ^ ^</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>The next factor involves the use of leading questions, and there were some leading questions obviously used in the garnering of information during the course of the video statement. The questions that were asked appeared to me to really be more in preparing the witness to answer other more important questions that were not leading. Again, given the entirety of the statement, I do not feel that the questioning or manner of questioning was such as to preclude the trustworthiness of what was said.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-5\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-6\">So given all of that, I\u2019m going to admit the videotape....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">During trial, Ms. Boccelli testified she was a licensed social worker employed by the Harford County Department of Social Services and assigned to the Harford County Child Advocacy Center (the \u201cCenter\u201d). Ms. Boccelli\u2019s role at the Center was to investigate allegations of child sexual abuse. On October 1, 2002,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Ms. Boccelli was assigned to investigate the allegations of [K]\u2019s abuse. On October 3, Ms. Boccelli met [K] at the Center to conduct an interview. Ms. Boccelli stated that interviews of this type were \u201cfrequently\u201d videotaped and \u201cgenerally a detective is involved in the investigation.\u201d Ms. Boccelli identified the videotape of the interview between herself and [K].</p>\n<p id=\"b614-8\">Following Ms. Boccelli\u2019s testimony on direct, appellant\u2019s counsel renewed his objection to the playing of the videotaped out-of-court statement of [K] \u201cfor all the reasons stated previously,\u201d which was denied, and at that time the videotape was played for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-9\">At the close of the State\u2019s case, appellant moved for judgment of acquittal as to all counts. After hearing arguments, the court granted appellant\u2019s motion with regard to Counts 1 and 3, stating that \u201cthe mere fact that [Ms. Collins] sees him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>standing there does not create penetration. The mere fact he\u2019s standing before her with his penis out does not give rise to penetration. Second degree rape requires penetration. Attempted second degree rape requires some indication that there is more than just standing there.\u201d The court, however, refused to grant appellant\u2019s motion with regard to Count 5 because \u201c[t]he evidence of that [penetration] is the testimony of the SAFE nurse that the interior labia were in fact red.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">During direct examination of Ms. Collins, the State asked her to \u201cdescribe [her] relationship with [appellant].\u201d Appellant\u2019s counsel objected, arguing that, should Ms. Collins testify that the relationship was violent, her testimony would be irrelevant and prejudicial evidence of \u201cother crimes.\u201d The court agreed to hear the testimony of Ms. Collins outside the presence of the jury before deciding on admissibility. The following then occurred.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-6\">THE STATE: I guess we\u2019ll go back to my original question. Describe your relationship with the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-7\">MS. COLLINS: It was not good, it was very violent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-8\">THE STATE: Can you tell us what it was like in your home?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-9\">MS. COLLINS: It was like walking on egg shells, I couldn\u2019t do anything without him getting upset.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-10\">THE STATE: Were you frightened of [appellant]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-11\">MS. COLLINS: He would punch holes in-he punched a hole, a large hole, in my daughter\u2019s bedroom door, and that was there and we both were afraid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-12\">THE STATE: Which daughter are you speaking of?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-13\">MS. COLLINS: [K], the oldest daughter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-14\">THE STATE: Okay.... At this point I guess I\u2019ll raise\u2014 Well, Your Honor, I do have photographs, I actually have photographs of that hole in that door.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-15\">THE COURT: All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-16\">THE STATE: I\u2019d be seeking to introduce these as well, and I guess it\u2019s still under the same auspices.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-17\">THE COURT: Yes, it\u2019s the same process.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>THE STATE: Are these photographs of that door?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-5\">MS. COLLINS: Yes, it is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-6\">THE STATE: Do you recognize these as photographs of the hole in the door?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-7\">MS. COLLINS: Yes, I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-8\">THE STATE: And are they true and accurate reflections of what the door looked like?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-9\">MS. COLLINS: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-10\">THE STATE: I won\u2019t admit them at this time, Your Honor, but that\u2019s where I\u2019m going, and that\u2019s basically the testimony, Your Honor, I would elicit from the witness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-11\">THE COURT: [Appellant\u2019s counsel], do you have any questions?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-12\">APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL: Well, I\u2019m still confused as to the relevance of it and I still don\u2019t know quite where we\u2019re going with this. She has given a description that he is very violent, but I don\u2019t know what that means and I don\u2019t know how it relates time-wise to the things that we are testifying about. The same thing with the holes in the door. Again, I don\u2019t know where that comes in terms of time to any of the alleged instances, and we have three fairly specific-well, it is prejudicial and not very probative regarding the issue of her not reporting. We seem to have two holes in a door, I gather coming from one burst of temper, which is being offered to explain the failure to report sexual abuse over a period lasting up to about two-and-a-half years, so I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s probative.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-13\">THE COURT: I think the court would disagree with you on that. What this is is evidence that sort of falls within the Merzbacher [<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>] case, and that would be that the defendant engaged in a pattern of conduct, at least in this witness\u2019s mind, that was such that it intimidated her, and it\u2019s being offered as her basis for not reporting the prior alleged sexual acts. I think it certainly is relevant, it was part of your opening statement, and it\u2019s an obvious question for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>jury as to why this was not reported previously. This is being offered as the reason why, and I think the probative value outweighs any unfair prejudice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b617-4\">Immediately after this colloquy and the court\u2019s ruling, the jury returned to the courtroom and the following occurred.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Auk\">THE STATE: Please describe your relationship with the defendant for the jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-5\">MS. COLLINS: It was like walking on egg shells. Every time I would defend myself, he would hit me. APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL: Objection. Ask to approach. THE COURT: Approach.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-6\">APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL: We didn\u2019t stay on track very long, did we?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-7\">THE COURT: Well, it\u2019s somewhat different, but\u2014 APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL: Your honor, it\u2019s not somewhat different from the proffer, it\u2019s hugely different from the proffer, and we\u2019re now clearly into other crimes as well as other bad acts evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-8\">THE COURT: Merzbacher says a pattern of conduct giving a basis for failure to report is admissible, and I\u2019m not going to grant your motion to disqualify that statement or this witness based on the prior testimony. I\u2019ve given [the State] an opportunity to establish what was implicit in the first proffer, that there was a pattern, and if she does that I\u2019m going to overrule your objection. Well, I\u2019m going to overrule it at this time anyway, and you\u2019ll have a continuing objection as to that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-9\">THE COURT: Let me see what happens here with respect to this particular witness and we\u2019ll go from there, but I believe from what I heard even the first time that there is in fact a pattern, and that\u2019s one of the reasons why I\u2019m overruling your objection. It\u2019s pretty obvious she\u2019s not the most articulate witness that\u2019s ever been on the witness stand, so we\u2019ll see what happens.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b618-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>Thereafter, Ms. Collins testified as to the prior sexual assaults on [K] by appellant. She also testified as to the photographs of the hole in the door. She explained that she did not tell anyone about the incidents because appellant threatened her and told her that he would hurt her and [K].</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">Questions Presented</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">As phrased by appellant:</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">1. Did the trial court err when it admitted into evidence, (1) the testimony of a social worker regarding out-of-court statements made by the victim during an interview between the social worker and the victim in the presence of a police detective; and (2) the videotape recording of that interview?</p>\n<p id=\"b618-8\">2. Did the trial court err by admitting testimony regarding other crimes in violation of Maryland Rule 5-404(b)?</p>\n<p id=\"b618-9\">8. Did the State present sufficient evidence to sustain a conviction of attempted second degree rape?</p>\n<p id=\"b618-10\">Parties\u2019 Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b618-11\">Appellant contends that Ms. Boccelli\u2019s testimony regarding out-of-court statements made by [K] and the videotaped interview of [K] were inadmissible and violated his constitutional right to confront the witnesses against him. In support of this contention, appellant argues that the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Crawford, </em>and Maryland\u2019s subsequent decision in <em>State v. Snowden, </em>385 Md. 64, 867 A.2d 314 (2005), mandate that testimonial statements may not be offered into evidence in a criminal trial unless the declarant is unavailable and the defendant had a prior opportunity to cross-examine the declarant. Appellant argues that [K]\u2019s statements to Ms. Boccelli were testimonial in nature because [K] spoke to Ms. Boccelli while Ms. Boccelli was acting in the capacity of a child abuse investigator for the county, and because [K] made the statements both to Ms. Boccelli and the police detective who was present during the interview. Furthermore, appellant contends that there was no indication that [K] was unavailable to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>testify, and there was no indication that appellant had a prior opportunity to cross-examine her.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\">Appellant urges us to address this issue on constitutional grounds, \u201cnotwithstanding defense counsel\u2019s failure to specifically object\u201d to the admission of [K]\u2019s out-of-court statements, because the law changed dramatically between the time of trial and the time of this. Thus, appellant suggests that we should take cognizance of the plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">Appellant\u2019s second contention is that the trial court erred by allowing Ms. Collins to describe her relationship with appellant. In support of this contention, appellant argues that Ms. Collins\u2019s testimony, outside of the presence of the jury, was that appellant punched a hole in a door. The testimony elicited from Ms. Collins in front of the jury, however, consisted of \u201cother crimes\u201d evidence pursuant to Maryland Rule 5-404(b), because the admitted testimony was of appellant\u2019s criminal acts of assaulting Ms. Collins on several occasions. Appellant argues that such evidence was highly prejudicial and inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">Finally, appellant contends that the evidence was insufficient to support a conviction for attempted second degree rape. Appellant argues that the evidence did not prove that appellant intended to have vaginal intercourse with [K] and that he took a substantial step to act on that intention as is required for an attempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">The State argues that this Court should decline to address appellant\u2019s complaint that his constitutional rights to confrontation were violated by the admission of [K]\u2019s out-of-court statements to Ms. Boccelli because appellant did not object to the videotape or to Ms. Boccelli\u2019s testimony relating to the videotape on confrontation grounds. Rather, the State contends, appellant objected only on the ground that the requirements of section 11-304 for establishing trustworthiness were not satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">As to the second issue, the State contends that the evidence of appellant\u2019s physical abuse was not offered to prove appellant\u2019s guilt, but rather to explain why Ms. Collins waited to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>report the prior incidents of sexual abuse. According to the State, under <em>Merzbacher v. State, </em>346 Md. 391, 697 A.2d 432 (1997), this type of evidence may be admitted because it was substantially relevant to a contested issue in the case and was relevant to the setting in which the alleged sexual misconduct took place.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">Finally, the State contends that the evidence was sufficient to persuade any rational trier of fact that appellant was guilty of attempted second degree rape. In support of this contention, the State argues that Ms. Holian\u2019s testimony, combined with the other circumstantial evidence of appellant\u2019 prior sexual abuse of [K], was sufficient for a jury to find the elements of attempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">1. <em>Testimony of Ms. Boccelli and admission of videotaped statement of [K]</em></p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">At the outset, in light of the wording used by appellant to describe his first contention, which could be read to suggest that Ms. Boccelli testified to the substance of [K]\u2019s out-of-court statements, we wish to clarify the evidence that is the subject of the challenge. Pursuant to section ll-304(c)(4), as noted by the court, Ms. Boccelli testified only that the out-of-court statements were made to her, and she was offering the videotape as a person acting lawfully in the course of her profession as a social worker. In other words, contrary to the implication that the out-of-court statements came in <em>through </em>the testimony of Ms. Boccelli, they did not. Rather, the out-of-court statement came in through the the videotape.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-8\">Turning to the issue, we agree with the State that appellant\u2019s first argument was not preserved for our review, and we decline to recognize plain error. We shall explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-9\">A. <em>The Confrontation Clause and \u201cTender Years\u201d Statute</em></p>\n<p id=\"b620-10\">The Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>tion and Article 21 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> provide that, in a criminal prosecution, the accused has the right to be confronted with the witnesses against him. This guarantee becomes particularly relevant when hearsay declarations are proffered. In <em>Ohio v. Roberts, </em>448 U.S. 56, 100 S.Ct. 2531, 65 L.Ed.2d 597 (1980), the Supreme Court determined that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-5\">when a hearsay declarant is not present for cross-examination at trial, <em>the Confrontation Clause normally requires a showing that he is unavailable. </em>Even then, his statement is admissible only if it bears adequate \u201cindicia of reliability.\u201d Reliability can be inferred without more in a case where the evidence falls within a firmly rooted hearsay exception. <em>In other cases, the evidence must be excluded, at least absent a showing of particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Adx2\"><em>Id. </em>at 56, 100 S.Ct. 2531 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">Thus, <em>Roberts </em>stood for the proposition that certain out-of-court declarations, <em>i.e., </em>where the evidence did not fall into a \u201cfirmly rooted hearsay exception,\u201d could be admitted into evidence when there was both a showing that the witness was unavailable <em>and </em>a showing of particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">Following <em>Roberts, </em>Maryland enacted its \u201ctender years\u201d statute, first codified at Md.Code (1973, Repl.Vol.1989), \u00a7 9-103.1 of the Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article, which provided for the admissibility of certain out-of-court statements that would otherwise be inadmissible hearsay. The legislation was enacted in response to concerns that child abuse and sexual offenses were not being prosecuted adequately due to many child victims\u2019 inability to testify as a result of their young age or fragile emotional state. <em>Snowden, </em>385 Md. at 76, 867 A.2d 314. Under this \u201ctender years\u201d exception, a court could admit into evidence in a juvenile proceeding or criminal trial hearsay statements by victims of child abuse if the statements were made to certain health or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>social work professionals in the course of their professions, and either the child was available, subject to cross-examination, and testified at the criminal proceeding or by closed circuit television, or was unavailable due to death, absence from the jurisdiction, serious physical disability, or inability to communicate due to severe emotional distress. Md.Code (1973, 1989 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 9-103.1(c) of the Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">The Supreme Court relaxed the constitutional requirement that the declarant be unavailable in <em>White v. Illinois, </em>502 U.S. 346, 354-57, 112 S.Ct. 736, 116 L.Ed.2d 848 (1992). In 1994, the legislature amended the statute so that it could be utilized regardless of whether the child was available to testify. <em>Snowden, </em>385 Md. at 78, 867 A.2d 314 (citations omitted). To satisfy the constitutional requirements of <em>Roberts, </em>however, the legislature \u201cimposed safeguards in the tender years statute intended to insure that any admitted statement possessed \u2018particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id.; see </em>Md. Code (2001), \u00a7 ll-304(e) of the Criminal Procedure Article. Particularly, when a child victim does not testify, the out-of-court statement will only be admissible when there is corroborative evidence that the defendant had the opportunity to commit the alleged crime, and thirteen other enumerated factors relating to trustworthiness are met.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>On March 8, 2004, seven days after appellant\u2019s sentencing hearing, the Supreme Court \u201cfundamentally altered its Confrontation Clause jurisprudence when it decided <em>Crawford </em>.... <footnotemark>12</footnotemark>\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 78, 867 A.2d 314 (citations omitted). In <em>Crawford, </em>the Court rejected the <em>Roberts </em>test for admissibility because it found the test \u201cfundamentally incompatible with the Framers\u2019 vision and interpretation of the [Confrontation] Clause.\u201d <em>Id. (citing, Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 68, 124 S.Ct. 1354). The Court instead held that the Confrontation Clause mandates that testimonial statements may not be offered into evidence in a criminal trial unless (1) the declarant/witness is unavailable, and (2) the defendant had a prior opportunity to cross-examine the declarant/witness. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">In <em>Snowden, </em>the Court of Appeals applied the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Crawford, </em>to statements made by child sexual abuse victims to a social worker, admitted into evidence via Section 11-304. In that case, the three young victims made statements to a social worker in the presence of a police officer. <em>Snowden, </em>385 Md. at 86, 867 A.2d 314. The victims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>did not testify at trial, but their out-of-court testimonial statements regarding sexual abuse were admitted through the testimony of the social worker. The Court of Appeals opined that because the social worker \u201cwas performing her responsibilities in response and at the behest of law enforcement, she became, for Confrontation Clause analysis, an agent of the police department.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). The Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-5\">[I]f a statement is made under such circumstances that would lead an objective person to believe that statements made in response to government interrogation later would be used at trial, the admission of those statements must be conditioned upon <em>Crawford\u2019s </em>requirements of unavailability and a prior opportunity to cross-examine.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b624-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 92, 867 A.2d 314.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">Appellant urges us to apply <em>Crawford </em>and <em>Snowden </em>because, like <em>Snowden, </em>the admission of [K]\u2019s out-of-court testimony to Ms. Boccelli, which testimony had occurred out-of-court and in the presence of a police detective, violated his right to confront the witnesses against him. In <em>Snowden, </em>however, unlike in the present case, the appellant specifically objected on constitutional grounds, thus preserving the Confrontation Clause issue for appellate review. <em>Snowden, </em>385 Md. at 93-95, 867 A.2d 314 (\u201cIn this case, Snowden objected to the use of the tender years statutory procedure because he felt it denied him the protections of the Confrontation Clause.\u201d) <em>Id. </em>at 96, 867 A.2d 314. Here, the basis of appellant\u2019s objection was only that the videotaped testimony as offered by Ms. Boccelli did not meet the particularized guarantees of trustworthiness requirements of Maryland\u2019s \u201ctender years\u201d hearsay exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-8\">B. <em>Plain Error</em></p>\n<p id=\"b624-9\">Normally, an appellate court will not decide any issue not raised in and decided by the trial court. <em>Richmond v. State, </em>330 Md. 223, 235, 623 A.2d 630 (1993); <em>see also </em>Md. Rule 8-131(a) \u201cOrdinarily, the appellate court will not decide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>any other issue unless it plainly appears by the record to have been raised in or decided by the trial court....\u201d. Thus, as explained below, we could end our analysis here as the issue was not preserved for appellate review by objection on confrontation grounds. Nevertheless, \u201cas the cases hold with respect to errors of law generally, an appellate court may in its discretion in an exceptional case take cognizance of plain error even though the matter was not raised in the trial court.\u201d <em>Rubin v. State, </em>325 Md. 552, 587, 602 A.2d 677 (1992) <em>(quoting Dempsey v. State, </em>277 Md. 134, 141-42, 355 A.2d 455) (other citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\">In <em>Trimble v. State, </em>300 Md. 387, 478 A.2d 1143 (1984), the Court of Appeals explained under what circumstances the exercise of plain error is justified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-5\">We said in <em>State v. Hutchinson, </em>287 Md. 198, 203, 411 A.2d 1035 (1980), that \u201cwe have characterized instances when an appellate court should take cognizance of unobjected to error as compelling, extraordinary, exceptional or fundamental to assure the defendant of fair trial.\u201d We further made clear that we would intervene in those circumstances only when the error complained of was so material to the rights of the accused as to amount to the kind of prejudice which precluded an impartial trial, (citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b625-6\"><em>Trimble, </em>300 Md. at 397, 478 A.2d 1143.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">Furthermore, although we have not \u201cset forth any fixed formula for determining when discretion should be exercised ... we do expect that the appellate court would review the materiality of the error in the context in which it arose, giving due regard to whether the error was purely technical, the product of conscious design or trial tactics or the result of bald inattention,\u201d <em>Hutchinson, </em>287 Md. at 202-03, 411 A.2d 1035; <em>see also Stanley v. State, </em>157 Md.App. 363, 370, 851 A.2d 612 (\u201cThere is no \u2018fixed formula for determining when we should exercise our discretion.\u2019 \u201d) <em>(quoting Rubin, </em>325 Md. at 588, 602 A.2d 677) (other citations omitted), as these enumerated factors \u201care ordinarily inconsistent with circumstances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>justifying an appellate court\u2019s intervention\u201d under plain error. <em>Rubin, </em>325 Md. at 588, 602 A.2d 677.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">Although appellant acknowledges that he failed to object on the ground that the admission of the out-of-court statements violated appellant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to confrontation, he implores us to address his unpreserved claim pursuant to our discretion under the plain error doctrine because his \u201cfailure to object ... was based not on inadvertence, but on a reasonable belief that the trial court\u2019s actions accorded with well-established law that fundamentally changed by the time of appeal.\u201d In support of this argument, appellant cites <em>Franklin v. State, </em>319 Md. 116, 571 A.2d 1208 (1990),<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>Hays v. State, </em>240 Md. 482, 214 A.2d 573 (1965),<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and <em>Squire v. State, </em>280 Md. 132, 368 A.2d 1019 (1977).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>suggests that these eases support the premise that his failure to preserve the constitutional issue for our review should be excused because they hold that where well-established law undergoes a substantial change while a case is pending appeal, <em>i.e., </em>before final judgment, appellate courts will consider an issue arising under the new interpretation of the law even if not raised at trial.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In the analysis that follows, however, we shall explain why we shall ultimately decline appellant\u2019s request to recognize plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-4\">\n<em>i. The Nature of the Change in the Law</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">Although we agree with appellant that federal constitutional law changed subsequent to his trial, appellant failed to present any constitutional challenge in circuit court based on his right to confront the witnesses against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">In <em>Roberts, </em>the Supreme Court addressed the relationship between the Confrontation Clause, <em>i.e., </em>where the accused has the constitutional right to be confronted with the witnesses against him, and hearsay, <em>i.e., </em>an admission in court of a statement made out of court to show the truth of the matter asserted. 448 U.S. at 62-65, 100 S.Ct. 2531. While we recognize the interrelationship between the two rules, <em>see California v. Green, </em>399 U.S. 149, 155, 90 S.Ct. 1930, 26 L.Ed.2d 489 (1970) (\u201c[hjearsay rules and the Confrontation Clause are generally designed to protect similar values\u201d); <em>Dutton v. Evans, </em>400 U.S. 74, 76, 91 S.Ct. 210, 27 L.Ed.2d 213 (1970) (Hearsay rules and the Confrontation Clause \u201cstem from the same roots\u201d), it is well-settled that the two grounds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>are not synonymous or coextensive; thus, objecting on one ground does not preserve the other ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">The Confrontation Clause, under the <em>Roberts </em>test, excluded hearsay that did not meet certain requirements \u2014 specifically, a showing of particularized guarantees of trustworthiness. At the time of trial in the present case, the Confrontation Clause was in existence and excluded hearsay unless it met the <em>Roberts </em>requirements. As noted above, while the hearsay rule and the constitutional issue are interrelated, the fact that evidence might have met the state requirement for admission did not necessarily mean that it would meet the federal constitutional requirement as it then existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">Distinguishable from the present case, in the cases relied upon by appellant, it would have been futile to object on <em>any </em>ground because the trial courts were merely applying the law as it then existed. In fact, for the Court in those cases to hold that the appellants had waived their right to object \u201cwould be to say that the appellants effectively waived a right which [the Court had] held did not then exist.\u201d <em>Hays, </em>240 Md. at 489, 214 A.2d 573. Conversely, although <em>Crawford </em>and <em>Snowden </em>altered the law with respect to the relationship between the Confrontation Clause and the rules of evidence as it relates to hearsay, it can hardly be said that the right to confront one\u2019s accusers under the Confrontation Clause is a new right that was not in existence at the time of appellant\u2019s trial and sentencing. <em>See Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 42-50, 124 S.Ct. 1354 (\u201cThe right to confront one\u2019s accusers is a concept that dates back to Roman times.\u201d) Indeed, unlike the cases cited by appellant, <em>Crawford </em>created no new right. Quite to the contrary, in fact, at the time of trial in this case, the Confrontation Clause was in existence and excluded hearsay unless it met the <em>Roberts </em>requirements for trustworthiness. Thus, when challenging trustworthiness and/or unavailability, appellant\u2019s counsel should have objected on confrontation as well as hearsay <em>grounds </em>\u2014 independent <em>from the subsequent change in the law. </em>As such, appellant was required to make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>an objection premised on a federal constitutional claim based on the absence of confrontation.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">Appellant argues that in <em>Prince v. State, </em>131 Md.App. 296, 748 A.2d 1078 (2000), precedent at the time of appellant\u2019s trial, we held that the \u201ctender years\u201d statute\u2019s incorporation of a multi-factor test to guarantee the trustworthiness of the child victim\u2019s statement satisfied constitutional requirements, and therefore, admission of out-of-court statements pursuant to the statute did not violate the Confrontation Clause. We could not and did not hold that the federal constitutional requirement did not have to be met. Similarly, we did not hold that compliance with the statute necessarily meant compliance with the constitutional requirement in all cases upon their own facts. The federal constitutional requirement was in existence after <em>Prince, </em>as it was before, and an objection was available on that ground. In <em>Prince, </em>as in <em>Snowden, </em>defense counsel did object on the ground of violation of the Confrontation Clause, and the objections were prior to the <em>Crawford </em>decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">ii. <em>Compelling, extraordinary, and exceptional circumstances</em></p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">As stated previously, an appellate court may not take cognizance of unobjected to error unless the error occurred in compelling, extraordinary, exceptional or fundamental circumstances which vitally affected the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-8\">Ms. Collins, based on her personal knowledge, testified that she saw (1) redness in [K]\u2019s vaginal area, (2) appellant behind [K] with his penis between her legs, and (3) appellant and [K] on the couch with her pants down, and appellant removing his pants. Additionally, Ms. Holian, the SAFE nurse, based on her personal knowledge, testified that she saw redness in [K]\u2019s vaginal area. The corroborating evidence offered by the State is certainly relevant, under a plain error analysis, to whether unobjected to error should be recognized as compelling, extraordinary, exceptional, or fundamental.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>After considering all of the circumstances, it is primarily the two factors, discussed above, that leads us to decline to recognize plain error in this case. The ramifications of trial counsel\u2019s error in failing to object on confrontational grounds will be better addressed in a post-conviction proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">2. <em>Testimony regarding \u201cother crimes\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">Appellant contends that the trial court committed reversible error by admitting Ms. Collins\u2019s testimony regarding \u201cother crimes\u201d in violation of Maryland Rule 5-404(b). Appellant observes that the State\u2019s proffered testimony outside of the presence of the jury \u2014 that appellant punched a hole in the door \u2014 differed from Ms. Collins\u2019s testimony before the jury\u2014 that appellant had hit her previously. Appellant contends that the information regarding his prior assaults on Ms. Collins should have been excluded \u201cbecause it may [have] tend[ed] to confuse the jurors, predispose them to a belief in the defendant\u2019s guilt, or prejudice their minds against the defendant.\u201d <em>Terry v. State, </em>382 Md. 329, 334, 631 A.2d 424 (1993) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">Maryland Rule 5-404(b) provides</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-8\">Other crimes, wrongs, or acts. Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character or a person in order to show action in conformity therewith. <em>It may, however, be admissible for other pmposes, </em>such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, common scheme or plain, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b630-9\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-10\">In other words, \u201cevidence of a defendant\u2019s prior criminal acts may not be introduced to prove that he is guilty of the offense for which he is on trial.\u201d <em>Straughn v. State, </em>297 Md. 329, 333, 465 A.2d 1166 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-11\">At the outset, we note that the admission of evidence is committed to the considerable and sound discretion of the trial court. <em>Merzbacher v. State, </em>346 Md. 391, 404, 697 A.2d 432 (1997) (citations omitted). Furthermore, all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>relevant evidence, <em>i.e., </em>evidence that tends to establish or refute a fact at issue in the case, is generally admissible. <em>See </em>Maryland Rule 5-402. Even relevant evidence, however, may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. <em>See </em>Maryland Rule 5-403. The trial court\u2019s relevancy determination, as well as its decision to admit relevant evidence over an objection that the evidence is unfairly prejudicial, will not be reversed absent an abuse of discretion. <em>Merzbacher, </em>346 Md. at 405, 697 A.2d 432.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">In <em>Merzbacher, </em>the Court of Appeals reviewed \u201cother crimes\u201d evidence in a sexual abuse case. Merzbacher was a teacher at the Catholic Community Middle School of Baltimore. <em>Id. </em>at 396, 697 A.2d 432. At his trial in 1995, Elizabeth Murphy testified that, from 1972 to 1975, Merzbacher subjected her to sexual, physical, and emotional violence. <em>Id. </em>On appeal, Merzbacher claimed that he was unfairly prejudiced by the admission of evidence relating to other criminal acts for which he was not on trial because of testimony alleging assaults upon other members of Murphy\u2019s class and other collateral behavior. <em>Id. </em>at 408, 697 A.2d 432. Recognizing the credibility issue related to the 20-year gap between the time Murphy reported the crime and the time it was committed, the trial court \u201c \u2018allow[ed] this type of evidence to come in as it relate[d] not necessarily to a specific charge but [because] it relate[d] to the victim in this case during the timeframe work of the specific charges.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 408-09, 697 A.2d 432 (alterations in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">The Court of Appeals, noting that Rule 5-404(b) \u201cincorporates well recognized exceptions to the general prohibition of other crimes evidence,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 407, 697 A.2d 432, refused to disturb the trial court\u2019s analysis, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-7\">Merzbacher defended himself by attacking the credibility of Murphy, pointing to the over two decades it took for her to come to the authorities. By doing so, he forced the State into showing the jury that Murphy\u2019s rape took place in a larger, more invidious context. Murphy testified, corroborated by other witnesses, that Merzbacher used a combina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>tion of frivolity and fright to run his classroom (internal citation omitted). In part, this served to explain and was particularly relevant to why Murphy, either reasonably or unreasonably, waited to reveal her story to the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 409, 697 A.2d 432.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">Ultimately, the Court concluded that \u201c \u2018evidence of other crimes may be admitted ... <em>if it is substantially relevant to some contested issue in the case </em>and if it is not offered to prove the defendant\u2019s guilt based on propensity to commit crime or his character as a criminal.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added) <em>(citing State v. Faulkner, </em>314 Md. 630, 634, 552 A.2d 896 (1989) (other citations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">Similarly, in the case before us, appellant argues that the evidence of appellant\u2019s prior assaults on Ms. Collins was unfairly prejudicial because it described criminal acts for which appellant was not on trial. During opening statements, appellant\u2019s counsel stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-8\">And you\u2019ll have to look at the credibility of the mother, who will come into court with I think the most incredible claim any mother can make in a courtroom, that she witnessed a sexual violation of her daughter and did nothing about it for years.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-9\">In so doing, appellant made one of the contested issues in the case why Ms. Collins waited to report the prior incidents of sexual abuse. One of her explanations for not reporting the incidents immediately was that her relationship with appellant was a violent one. The trial court, recognizing that appellant raised the issue of Ms. Collins\u2019s failure to report the incidents immediately, thus making it relevant, concluded that the probative value of the testimony outweighed the danger of unfair prejudice. We perceive no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-10\">3. <em>Sufficiency of the evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b632-11\">Appellant argues that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his conviction for attempted second degree rape, based on the incident of late September 2002, because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>the State failed to prove that appellant intended to have vaginal intercourse with [K] and took a substantial step in that regard. At the outset, we note that the standard for reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence is \u201cwhether, after considering the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 313, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979); <em>see State v. Smith, </em>374 Md. 527, 533, 823 A.2d 664 (2003). We give \u201cdue regard to the [fact finder\u2019s] findings of facts, its resolution of conflicting evidence, and significantly, its opportunity to observe and assess the credibility of witnesses.\u201d <em>See Hanison v. State, </em>382 Md. 477, 488, 855 A.2d 1220 (2004) (citing <em>McDonald v. State, </em>347 Md. 452, 474, 701 A.2d 675 (1997)), <em>cert. denied, </em>522 U.S. 1151, 118 S.Ct. 1173, 140 L.Ed.2d 182 (1998) (quoting <em>State v. Albrecht, </em>336 Md. 475, 478, 649 A.2d 336 (1994)).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\">In its instructions to the jury, the trial court stated, in accordance with Md.Code (2002), \u00a7\u00a7 3-301, 3-304 of the Criminal Law Article:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-5\">The defendant is also charged with attempted second degree rape. The definition of \u201cattempt\u201d is a substantial step, beyond mere preparation, toward the commission of a crime, and in order to convict the defendant of attempted second degree rape, the State has to prove the following: 1) that the defendant took a substantial step, beyond mere preparation, toward the commission of the crime of second degree rape; and 2) that the defendant intended to commit the crime of second degree rape.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-6\">In order to convict the defendant of attempted second degree rape, the State has to prove: 1) that the defendant attempted to have vaginal intercourse with [K] on September 29th, 2002; 2) that [K] was under the age of 14 years at the time of the act; and 3) that the defendant was at least four years older than [K],</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-7\">Vaginal intercourse, for the purpose of this crime, means the penetration of the penis into the vagina.
