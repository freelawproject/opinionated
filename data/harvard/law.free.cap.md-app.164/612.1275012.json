EYLER, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b641-15\">In the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Corey Caldwell, the appellant, was charged in two indictments with crimes arising from the shooting of Dar\u00edan Nelson and the attempted shooting of Davon Jackson, in a single incident. The charges were tried together to a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>In the Nelson case, the jury returned verdicts of not guilty of attempted first-degree murder and guilty of first-degree assault, reckless endangerment, use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence, carrying a handgun, and discharging a handgun in Baltimore City. It did not return a verdict on the charge of attempted second-degree murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">In the Jackson case, the jury returned a verdict of guilty of first-degree assault, reckless endangerment, use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence, carrying a handgun, and discharging a handgun in Baltimore City. It did not return a verdict on the attempted first-degree murder and attempted second-degree murder charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">The court <em>sua sponte </em>declared a mistrial on the three counts on which no verdicts were returned. The reasons were that the courthouse was closing in less than an hour because Hurricane Isabel was approaching Baltimore and the subways had been shut down; the courthouse likely would be closed the following day, due to the storm; one of the jurors could not return to deliberate the next business day thereafter, without losing a prepaid vacation the court and counsel had assured her, during <em>voir dire, </em>she would not lose; and the defense was not willing to proceed with an 11-member jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">After denying a new trial motion, the court vacated one conviction for carrying a handgun and one conviction for discharging a firearm in Baltimore City, and merged the remaining convictions on those charges. It then imposed sentences in both cases.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">The appellant noted a timely appeal. We have rephrased and reordered his questions as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>I. Did the trial court err by taking a partial verdict on \u25a0 the ten counts on which guilty verdicts were returned?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-5\">II. Did the trial court err by declaring a mistrial on three counts?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-6\">III. Must the docket entries be corrected to properly reflect that the appellant was acquitted of attempted first-degree murder of Dar\u00edan Nelson?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-7\">IV. Did the trial court err by permitting the State to impeach the appellant with statements he allegedly made to a person who was not called as a witness?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-8\">V. Did the sentencing court err by not merging the appellant\u2019s sentences for reckless endangerment into his sentences for first-degree assault?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b643-9\">We answer Question I in the affirmative and therefore shall reverse the ten judgments of conviction and remand the counts on which they are based to the circuit court, for further proceedings. Question II is not properly before us, because there is no final judgment on the three counts on which a mistrial was declared. We answer Question III in the affirmative, and direct the circuit court to correct the docket entries to reflect that the verdict on the count of attempted first-degree murder in the Nelson case was not guilty. Because of our disposition of Question I, and because it is highly speculative whether the issues will resurface on retrial, we shall not address Questions IV and V.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-10\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b643-11\">The key events in this case took place around 8:00 p.m. on September 3, 2002, on Berger Avenue in Baltimore City. Dar\u00edan Nelson, then ten years old, was standing in front of his family\u2019s house, at 4348 Berger Avenue, with his mother and two brothers. He heard a sound like firecrackers and felt a burning pain in his side. He exclaimed, \u201cfirecrackers hit me.\u201d At the same time, a man later identified as Davon Jackson ran past him on the street. Jackson continued around the corner, into the Nelson family\u2019s backyard. A few minutes later, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>Jackson emerged and apologized to Mrs. Nelson, saying, \u201cthey were trying to shoot at me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">Emergency medical workers and police arrived on the scene. Nelson was found to have suffered a gunshot wound and was taken to the hospital. The police arrested Jackson and took him to the station house. Jackson told them the shooter was a man he knew as \u201cRon,\u201d who was angry with him because he thought Jackson was having an affair with Muriel Brewington, \u201cRon\u2019s\u201d stepsister. Brewington is the mother of \u201cRon\u2019s\u201d best friend\u2019s children.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">Jackson showed the police a house near the Nelsons\u2019 house where \u201cRon\u2019s\u201d family was living. In a search of the house based on a warrant, the police found information that led them to think the appellant and \u201cRon\u201d were the same person. The police prepared a photographic array that included the appellant\u2019s picture and showed it to Jackson. Jackson selected the appellant\u2019s photograph as depicting \u201cRon,\u201d the shooter.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">As stated previously, the appellant was charged in two indictments with crimes arising out of the shooting of Nelson and the attempted shooting of Jackson. The cases were tried together before a jury beginning on September 11, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-8\">The State called as witnesses Nelson, his two brothers, and his mother. They testified about the events surrounding the shooting, as we have recounted them. A neighbor, Michelle Coward, testified that she saw the appellant chase Jackson down Berger Avenue and fire a gun at him. She gave the police that information on the day of the shooting, but told them she did not want to be involved. Nine months later, on June 8, 2003, the police showed Coward a photographic array. She selected the appellant\u2019s picture from the array. She testified that she was certain that the appellant was the shooter.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-9\">The State also called Brewington as a witness. She testified that, in a telephone conversation the morning after the shooting, the appellant told her that he and Jackson had been \u201ctussling\u201d over a gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>When the State called Jackson to testify, he recanted his statement to the police. He testified that he and the appellant were victims of an attempted robbery by an unknown third person. He said he had blamed the shooting on the appellant because he thought the appellant had \u201cset up\u201d the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-4\">Ballistics evidence showed that two cartridge casings recovered at the scene were fired by the same gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">The appellant testified in his own defense. He said he had not known Jackson well but had been -with him on the evening in question, before the shooting. They were approached by a third man, whom the appellant did not know, who tried to rob them. They ran in opposite directions. As he was running, the appellant heard gunshots. He did not have a gun and did not fire a gun. He never told Brewington that he and Jackson had tussled over a gun. He thought Jackson had \u201cset [him] up\u201d for the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">Another neighbor of the Nelsons, Darrell Brown, testified for the defense. He said that, on the night in question, he saw a man running up Berger Avenue with a gun. The man was not the appellant. Brown did not know the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">We shall include additional facts as necessary to our discussion of the issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b645-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-10\">\n<em>Did the trial court err in taking partial verdicts?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b645-11\">(a)</p>\n<p id=\"b645-12\">The jury was selected and sworn on September 11, 2003. The evidence phase of the trial lasted three days: September 12, 15, and 16. The case went to the jury for deliberation at about noon on September 17. The jurors deliberated until 5:35 p.m., at which time they sent a note saying they \u201cha[d] not decide [sic] a verdict yet. Please let us know when it\u2019s time to leave.\u201d The court released the jurors for the evening.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>The jurors returned at 9:30 a.m. the next day, September 18, and resumed deliberation.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">In the days before September 18, Hurricane Isabel was moving north, on a path to strike the mid-Atlantic coastline. Forecasts were calling for the hurricane to be severe. In anticipation that it would be, and based on tracking information from the National Weather Service, the Governor of Maryland issued an Executive Order declaring a state of emergency as of 11 p.m. on September 16. <em>See </em>Md. Regs. Code tit. 01, \u00a7 01.2003.30. The storm was slow-moving, however, and by the morning of September 18, it had not yet made landfall. <em>See </em>National Weather Service, \u201cService Assessment, Hurricane Isabel, September 18-19, 2003,\u201d <em>available at </em>http://www.weather.gov/os/assessments/pd fs/isabel.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">Around noon, as the jury was deliberating, the trial judge was alerted that the Administrative Judge had directed that the courthouse would close at 1:00 p.m., due to the impending hurricane. Counsel and the appellant were convened and the jury was brought into the courtroom. The trial judge announced that the courthouse was closing and was unlikely to be open the next day (Friday September 19), given the weather forecast. He asked the jurors to return Monday, September 22, to resume deliberating.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">At that point, Juror Number Two motioned that there was a problem, and was brought to the bench. Both lawyers reminded the judge that during <em>voir dire </em>Juror Number Two had made it known that she was leaving on Saturday, September 20, for a prepaid vacation to New Orleans, and had voiced concern about whether sitting on the jury would cause her to lose her vacation. Because the court and counsel all thought the trial would be over by September 19, at the latest, they had assured Juror Number Two that sitting on the jury would not interfere with her travel plans. Juror Number Two could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>not return to deliberate on Monday, September 22, without losing her prepaid vacation.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">Juror Number Two was reseated and the judge and counsel conferred at the bench. Defense counsel said he would not agree to proceed with an ]1-person jury. The following ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-6\">THE COURT: I just don\u2019t think in good conscious [sic] I think [sic] tell this woman [Juror Number Two] \u2014 I remember her discussing this at the bench.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-7\">[DEFENSE]: I do too.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b647-8\">At that point, the court called the foreperson to the bench and this colloquy took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-9\">THE COURT: And \u2014 can the foreperson come up here a second? Ma\u2019am. Are you making progress?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-10\">JUROR: Mmm-hum. We are. It\u2019s hard.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-11\">THE COURT: Okay. Thanks.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-12\">JUROR: We\u2019re on the last one.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-13\">THE COURT: You\u2019re what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-14\">JUROR: (inaudible).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-15\">THE COURT: Okay. Thanks.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b647-16\">The foreperson returned to her seat, but immediately was called back to the bench:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-17\">THE COURT: Let me make sure I understand you. Were you suggesting that a vote \u2014 there was one person who is not agreeing or that you, had agreed to a unanimous verdict on every count, but one.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-18\">JUROR: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-19\">THE COURT: You have a unanimous verdict on every count but one. What count is that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-20\">[PROSECUTOR]: What number as opposed to \u2014 do you remember\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-21\">THE COURT: Hand me the verdict sheet.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-22\">THE CLERK: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-23\">THE COURT: Do you have it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-24\">[DEFENSE]: I have it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>CALDWELL v. STATE [164 Md.App. 612 (2005).]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-4\">[PROSECUTOR]: Do you have a problem with that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AD_\">[DEFENSE]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-5\">THE COURT: Which count is it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-6\">JUROR: It\u2019s the one on this one.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-7\">THE COURT: That is the count [attempted] first-degree murder of Davon Jackson?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-8\">JUROR: Jackson.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-9\">THE COURT: You haven\u2019t agreed to a verdict on that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-10\">You\u2019ve agreed on everything else?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-11\">JUROR: Mmm-hum.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-12\">THE COURT: Twelve to nothing. Right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-13\">JUROR: We want to change one if they change that one. It\u2019s like five people.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-14\">[DEFENSE]: Can you say that again? I didn\u2019t hear that one.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-15\">JUROR: It\u2019s like five people that\u2019s against.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-16\">THE COURT: Pardon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-17\">JUROR: Five people that\u2019s against the (inaudible).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-18\">THE COURT: All right. Thanks. Do you \u2014 all right. You can sit down----</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b648-19\">The clerk interjected to say that the subways were closing at 2:00 p.m. and that the rain had started. Defense counsel repeated that he would not agree to an 11-person jury. He objected to the court\u2019s taking partial verdicts, saying the jurors \u201cneed to make a decision with regard to everything or not.\u201d The judge ruled that he was going to take verdicts \u201con what they have a verdict on.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b648-20\">Counsel returned to their tables and the judge announced:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-21\">All right. Let me explain what I\u2019m going to do. I\u2019m confronted with a situation where juror number two who told me when we did voir dire originally that she had to be out of here Saturday. Still has to be out of here Saturday because she has travel plans. Counsel will not agree to accept an 11 person jury so we can\u2019t do that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>The foreman has told me which I trust is correct, that you have a 12 to nothing verdict on all but a couple of counts, correct? What I\u2019ve decided to do and counsel and I will discuss the problems involved with this later, but I\u2019m going to take the verdict on the counts you\u2019ve reached a unanimous verdict on and end this as far as you\u2019re concerned. So, you understand what I\u2019m saying? Can you stand up, madame foreperson? Am I correct in my understanding of what has occurred? All right.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">At the bench, defense counsel expressed concern about the court\u2019s declaring a mistrial on any count the jurors were not \u201cdeadlocked\u201d on. The judge acknowledged that the jury \u201cpossibly could\u201d reach verdicts on the undecided counts, if left to deliberate further, but because of the circumstances, he was going to declare a mistrial on those counts.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-6\">In open court, the judge addressed the foreperson:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-7\">THE COURT: Okay. Stand up again. Am I correct that you have a verdict on all but \u2014 how many counts?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-8\">JUROR: Two.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-9\">THE COURT: Two. You have a unanimous 12 to nothing verdict? I\u2019m going to ask the clerk at this point \u2014 stand down \u2014 to take the verdict.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b649-10\">Defense counsel objected, saying, \u201cI just want to point out that they\u2019re still talking. She [the foreperson] came down here and she\u2019s still talking to them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b649-11\">The judge overruled the objection and summarized the situation: Everyone had been directed by the Administrative Judge to vacate the courthouse; counsel would not agree to an 11-person jury to return on Monday; and one juror could not return on Monday. The judge said he was \u201cdeclaiming] a mistrial on the remaining counts lor th[ose] reason[s] so the record is clear.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b649-12\">The clerk then took the verdicts, addressing the foreperson and asking her, count by count, to announce each verdict. In the Nelson case, the foreperson stated that the appellant was not guilty of attempted first-degree murder; there was no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>verdict on attempted second-degree murder; and the appellant was guilty of first-degree assault, reckless endangerment, unlawful use of a handgun, carrying a handgun, and discharging a handgun in Baltimore City.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">In the Jackson case, the foreperson announced that there was no verdict on the attempted first-degree murder count. She then announced a verdict of guilty on the attempted second-degree murder count, but said, \u201c[i]n the first-degree\u2014 the first one we don\u2019t have no charge on that one. Assault \u2014 \u201d The clerk interrupted and asked the foreperson a second time for the jury\u2019s verdict on the attempted second-degree murder count in the Jackson case. The foreperson responded but her answer was recorded as \u201cinaudible.\u201d She proceeded to announce verdicts of guilty on the counts of first-degree assault, reckless endangerment, unlawful use of a handgun, carrying a handgun, and discharging a firearm in Baltimore City.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">The clerk repeated each count in each case and the verdict announced on it. It is clear from the clerk\u2019s words that the \u201cinaudible\u201d response by the foreperson to the clerk\u2019s question had been that there was no verdict on the count of attempted second-degree murder in the Jackson case. Regarding the attempted murder counts, the clerk repeated the counts and verdicts as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-7\">[A]s to the first count [of] attempted murder in the first-degree of Dar\u00edan Nelson you said not guilty. As to attempted murder in the second-degree of Dar\u00edan Nelson you said no answer .... as to attempt to kill and murder Davon Jackson there was no answer to either the first or second degrees....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b650-8\">The jurors agreed to the verdicts as recited by the clerk.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-9\">Defense counsel requested a poll, which was taken. Each juror , agreed to the verdicts as announced by the foreperson <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>and repeated by the clerk. The clerk then hearkened the jury to their verdicts, as the court had recorded them.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">After some unproductive discussion about the possibly of entering a <em>nol prosequi </em>on the three counts on which no verdicts were returned, the court declared a mistrial on those counts, saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-6\">For the reasons we\u2019ve discussed at length on the record, I\u2019m going to find that with respect to all the other issues there\u2019s manifest necessity to declare a mistrial for the reasons that I discussed on the unresolved issues.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">The jury then was discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">The appellant filed a motion for new trial, asserting that the jurors should have been allowed to continue deliberating until they reached an agreement on all counts. The State filed an opposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-9\">At a hearing on the motion, defense counsel argued that the jurors had been \u201cforced into making a rushed judgment.\u201d He asserted that there was a sense of urgency on the part of the jurors to deliver a verdict \u201cbefore we all get swept away by this storm,\u201d and that there was confusion in the jury box before the verdicts were taken, from which it appeared that the verdicts were not the product of \u201ca whole lot of consensus and confidence.\u201d He maintained that, if the jurors had been kept to deliberate until they had decided all the counts in both cases, they might have changed their minds to the appellant\u2019s benefit on the counts on which guilty verdicts were returned. Defense counsel argued that the appellant\u2019s \u201cright to a jury trial really was taken \u2014 in essence was taken away from him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b651-10\">The judge denied the new trial motion. He pointed out that the jurors had reached agreement on some of the counts before they were brought into the courtroom and told the courthouse was closing. Also, in the judge\u2019s observation, there was not a sense of urgency in the courtroom and the verdicts were not rushed or coerced. Furthermore, the ver-</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>diets were made clear by polling. Any confusion that preceded the poll appeared to him to have been about the correct numbers of the counts that were decided, not about the decisions themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">The judge gave the following assessment of the situation that existed when the partial verdicts were taken:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-6\">I didn\u2019t perceive there to be any question in [the jurors\u2019] minds, but that they had a unanimous verdict on that which they had a[ ] unanimous verdict on. I did sense, as I recall, \u2022that there was some confusion as to whether or not [the foreperson] was identifying the right counts and identifying what she was entering a verdict on because that could have been a little confusing.... While there may have been a little confusion over which counts they were, that was more a matter of \u2014 not a matter of whether they agreed upon the counts, but as to what their numbers were. The \u2014 I didn\u2019t perceive their verdict was coerced.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">(b)</p>\n<p id=\"b652-8\">A criminal defendant in a Maryland court is guaranteed an \u201cimpartial jury\u201d by the Sixth Amendment, as applied to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment, <em>Attorney Grievance Com\u2019n of Maryland v. Gansler, </em>377 Md. 656, 675, 835 A.2d 548 (2003), and by Article 21 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. Article 21 further guarantees an accused in a criminal prosecution the right to a jury \u201cwithout whose unanimous consent he ought not be found guilty.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b653-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>In Maryland, for a verdict in a criminal case tried by jury to be final, the jury must intentionally render a unanimous verdict. <em>Smith v. State, </em>299 Md. 158, 163-64, 472 A.2d 988 (1984); <em>Pugh v. State, </em>271 Md. 701, 706, 319 A.2d 542 (1974). A case is removed from the province of the jury when the jury is hearkened to its verdict and the verdict is accepted by the court; or when the jury is polled, and the verdict as polled is accepted by the court. <em>Smith, supra, </em>299 Md. at 168-69, 472 A.2d 988. Moreover,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-5\">Until the case is removed from the jury\u2019s province the verdict may be altered or withdrawn by the jurors, or by the dissent or non-concurrence of any one of them. While the case is still within the province of the jury, the court may permit [the jurors] to reconsider and correct the verdict, provided nothing be done amounting to coercion or tending to influence conviction or acquittal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">Rule 4-327 governs the procedure for jury verdicts in criminal cases. Subsection (a) implements Article 21, stating that the verdict of a jury in such a case \u201cshall be unanimous.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">Subsection (d) of Rule 4-327 allows for a partial verdict, <em>i.e., </em>a verdict on less than all counts in a multi-count case. Generally, each count in an indictment is regarded as if it were a separate indictment, and the jury is required to determine whether to make a finding of guilt on each count without regard to the disposition of other counts. <em>Mack v.

When a verdict is \u201cambiguous, inconsistent, unresponsive, or otherwise defective,\u201d the trial judge should call the jury\u2019s attention to the defect and direct the jurors to put it in proper form, if the defect is one of form; or return them to the jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>room for further deliberations, if the defect is one of substance. <em>Id. </em>at 170, 472 A.2d 988; <em>Heinze v. State, </em>184 Md. 618, 617, 42 A.2d 128 (1945).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">(c)</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">The appellant complains that, in the unusual circumstances of this case, the trial judge accepted partial verdicts on tentative votes that were not yet final. This error violated his right to a unanimous jury. Furthermore, \u201cforcing\u201d the verdicts denied the appellant his right to an impartial jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">The appellant supports his tentativeness argument by pointing to a number of factors that, in his view, show the jurors had not reached a final agreement on any count when the partial verdicts were taken. First, the deliberation did not end of its own accord, but was interrupted, suddenly. Second, according to the foreperson, before the deliberation was interrupted, the jurors were bargaining over their decisions on some counts. Third, the foreperson herself was so uncertain about whether agreements had been reached that she changed her report to the court about the number of counts on which verdicts were agreed, from all but one to all but more than one. Fourth, immediately before the verdicts were announced, there was confusion in the jury box, signaling that other members of the jury likewise were uncertain about what they had decided. Finally, that uncertainty continued during the announcement of the verdicts. One verdict first was returned as guilty and then was changed to \u201cno verdict.\u201d When all was said and done, there were three counts \u2014 not one or two \u2014 on which no verdict was returned.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-8\">In support of his coercion argument, the appellant posits that the exigency of the situation \u2014 the imminent closure of the courthouse and the inability of the full jury to return to conclude its deliberation \u2014 compelled the jurors to reach and return verdicts that had not been agreed to. He asserts that, to the extent the jurors were discussing and deciding the case in the jury box, their deliberation took place under coercive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>circumstances and their votes were not freely and voluntarily made.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">In anticipation of the State\u2019s response, the appellant also argues that, because the partial verdicts were defective as not being the product of final agreements by the jurors, polling and hearkening did not cure their defects.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">The State responds that the jurors knew during deliberation that each verdict on each count had to be unanimous, because they were so instructed before deliberation began. When the jurors were returned to the courtroom and told that the courthouse was going to be closed, the foreperson volunteered at the bench that they already had reached unanimous agreement as to most of the counts. The court double checked that the verdicts so reached were unanimous, asking, more than once, whether they were \u201c12 to 0.\u201d The trial judge\u2019s assessment of the situation was that the jurors were in actual agreement on verdicts on the ten counts of guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">The State maintains that the foreperson\u2019s remark, \u201c[w]e want to change one if they change that one,\u201d was vague and did not show, affirmatively, that the jurors still were deliberating on any of the counts on which verdicts then were returned. According to the State, the murkiness in the record \u2014 especially that it does not show that the foreperson was pointing to particular charges when saying \u201cthis one\u201d and \u201cthat one\u201d and that it does not reveal whatever was taking place in the jury box that the appellant now contends was \u201cconfusion\u201d \u2014 militates against the appellant\u2019s tentative agreement and coercion arguments, because he bears the burden to present an adequate record on appeal. Also, the trial judge\u2019s observations of what transpired, made later at the hearing on the motion for new trial, belie the appellant\u2019s assertion that there was confusion in the jury box.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">The State argues, in addition, that any confusion that may have occurred in the jury box and that may have been evidenced by the foreperson\u2019s changing statements about how many counts were agreed to are of no moment because the jurors were polled and hearkened to their verdicts.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>The determinative issue here is whether, when the jurors ceased their deliberation, upon being interrupted and called into the courtroom, they had reached a final agreement on the counts on which the court then accepted verdicts.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-4\">A jury only may return a verdict with respect to a count on which it has agreed. Rule 4-327(d). Accordingly, unless the jury has agreed on a verdict on a count, the court may not accept a partial verdict on that count. It is legal error to do otherwise. An agreement sufficient to produce a valid verdict must be unanimous because unanimity of decision is a fundamental aspect of the jury trial. <em>Davis v. Slater, </em>383 Md. 599, 613, 861 A.2d 78 (2004). In a jury trial, \u201c \u2018[ujnanimity is indispensable to the sufficiency of the verdict.\u2019 \u201d <em>Smith, supra, </em>299 Md. at 164, 472 A.2d 988 (quoting <em>Ford v. State, </em>12 Md. 514, 519 (1859)) (emphasis omitted). As we have explained, Article 21 of the Declaration of Rights guarantees that a criminal defendant \u201cought not be found guilty without the unanimous consent of the jurors.\u201d The concept of unanimity thus embraces not only numerical completeness but also completeness of assent, <em>i.e., </em>each juror making his or her decision freely and voluntarily, without being swayed or tainted by outside influences. <em>See Bishop v. State, </em>341 Md. 288, 294, 670 A.2d 452 (1996) (noting that, while the case is within the province of the jury, the court may permit the jury to reconsider verdicts upon which it is not unanimous but may do nothing to coerce or influence the verdicts); <em>Harris, supra, </em>160 Md.App. at 101, 862 A.2d 516 (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">A jury verdict that is not unanimous is defective and will not stand. The Court of Appeals has held that, when, upon polling, a verdict is revealed not to be unanimous, there is no verdict. <em>Smith, supra, </em>299 Md. at 179-80, 472 A.2d 988. In that situation, the trial court must take corrective action, either by returning the jury to its room for further deliberations or by noncoercively attempting to clarify a juror\u2019s ambiguous response through questions. <em>Heinze, supra, </em>184 Md. at 617, 42 A.2d 128; <em>Glickman v. State, </em>190 Md. 516, 525, 60 A.2d 216 (1948); <em>Harris, supra, </em>160 Md.App. at 101, 862 A.2d 516.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>A verdict is defective for lack of unanimity when it is unclear whether all of the jurors have agreed to it. <em>See Lattisaw v. State, </em>329 Md. 339, 346-47, 619 A.2d 548 (1993) (holding that trial court erred by enrolling guilty verdict and not taking steps to cure ambiguity after, in response to poll asking whether jurors agreed with verdict as announced by foreperson, juror gave ambiguous response, \u201cYes, with reluctance\u201d). <em>See also Bishop, supra, </em>341 Md. at 294, 670 A.2d 452 (holding that trial court erred in re-polling the jury when one juror said his verdict was given reluctantly; and further holding that not taking action sufficient to clarify the juror\u2019s ambiguous response and instead immediately re-polling the jury \u201cgenerated a significant possibility\u201d that the reluctant juror\u2019s \u201cyes\u201d vote was coerced, by communicating to him that any other vote was not acceptable); <em>Rice v. State, </em>124 Md. App. 218, 222, 720 A.2d 1287 (1998) (holding that trial court properly acted to cure ambiguity in verdict as originally returned in noncoercive manner).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">Likewise, a verdict does not satisfy the unanimity of assent requirement, and hence is not a valid verdict, when the decision of a juror or the jury as a whole is conditional. <em>See Biggs v. State, </em>56 Md.App. 638, 652, 468 A.2d 669 (1983) (recognizing the principle but holding that juror\u2019s response on polling was not conditional or uncertain). <em>See also Matthews v. United States, </em>252 A.2d 505, 506 (D.C.1969) (contrasted and distinguished in Biggs) (reversing judgment of conviction entered after one juror, on polling, said her vote was guilty but \u201cconditional\u201d and holding that, upon hearing that response, trial judge was required to return the jury to its room for further deliberation). <em>See also United States v. Austin, </em>231 F.3d 1278, 1282 (10th Cir.2000) (holding that, \u201c[w]hen there is doubt cast on the unqualified nature of the verdict, ... th[e] court must take a closer look at the circumstances of the jury\u2019s recommendation\u201d); <em>Cook v. United States, </em>379 F.2d 966, 970 (5th Cir.1967) (holding that jurors\u2019 exceptional request, on poll of verdict, for extreme leniency was a circumstance strongly suggesting that verdict was conditioned upon court\u2019s acceptance of jury\u2019s mercy recommendation, and had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>the effect of nullifying the verdict); <em>Lewis v. United States, </em>466 A.2d 1234, 1238 (D.C.App.1983) (holding that test for validity of verdict is whether it is certain, unqualified, and unambiguous in light of, among other things, the circumstances surrounding its receipt).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">Although it has never been addressed directly by the Maryland appellate courts, federal courts and other state courts addressing the unanimity aspect of a jury verdict have held that votes that are tentative, like those that are conditional, are not given with unanimous consent, because they are not final. In other words, a verdict that is reached by unanimous assent must be intended to be a final decision, not subject to change or further reconsideration in the deliberation process.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">In <em>United States v. Taylor, </em>507 F.2d 166 (5th Cir.1975), the court held that preliminary votes by a jury in the jury room do hot constitute a verdict. The circumstances there were unusual. The jury was in the deliberating phase of the trial, in which 16 counts had been submitted for decision. After deliberation began but before a verdict was returned in open court, one juror suffered a fatal heart attack.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The remaining jurors were assembled in the courtroom and, in response to questions by the court, including whether they had reached a verdict on any count, stated that, before the death, all 12 of the jurors had voted and agreed to verdicts on three counts. The court had the jurors return to the jury room to take another vote on the same counts, which produced unanimous (11 to 0) votes. The court then accepted the verdicts of guilty on three counts and declared a mistrial on the other counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">The Fifth Circuit reversed, concluding that the guilty verdicts were not valid, in part because they were returned on votes taken in the jury room, which are \u201cpreliminary.\u201d 507 F.2d at 168. The court held that \u201ca jury has not reached a valid verdict <em>until deliberations are over, </em>the result is announced in open court, and no dissent by a juror is regis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>tered.\u201d 507 F.2d at 168 (emphasis added). It explained that, especially when more than one count has been submitted for decision, \u201ccontinuing deliberations may shake views expressed on counts previously considered. Jurors are not bound by votes in the jury room and remain free to register dissent even after the verdict has been announced, though before the verdict is recorded.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court observed that upholding a verdict after one juror has died \u201cdeprives a criminal defendant of the very real benefit of reconsideration and change of mind or heart.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court concluded that the \u201cend result\u201d in the case was \u201cjudgment by eleven,\u201d when the defendant had not agreed to a jury of less than twelve. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">In <em>Com. v. Williams, </em>279 Pa.Super. 28, 420 A.2d 727 (1980), a jury, while deliberating, wrote on its verdict sheet that it had reached a verdict of acquittal on an attempted murder count, one of six counts before it. In subsequent deliberations, it scratched out that entry. It later returned to the courtroom and informed the judge that it had reached a decision on a resisting arrest count but was hopelessly deadlocked on the remaining five counts. The court accepted the partial verdict on that count. Upon seeing the verdict sheet, the judge asked why the decision on the attempted murder count was scratched out. The foreman responded that the jurors had reconsidered their prior decision to acquit and were now deadlocked on that count. A motion for mistrial was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>On appeal from a conviction in a retrial, the defendant argued that, under double jeopardy principles, he could not be retried for attempted murder. The court held that the acquittal decision made in the jury room, and entered on the verdict sheet, and then erased, had been a tentative decision that was not a final verdict on that charge; therefore, retrial was not barred under double jeopardy principles. <em>Cf. State v. Giblin, </em>589 S.W.2d 431, 433 (Tex.Crim.App.1979) (holding that note from jury stating it had voted 12 to 0 for acquittal on one count and was hung on a second count was a report on the jury\u2019s progress in deliberating, not a final verdict).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">In <em>United States v. DiLapi, </em>651 F.2d 140 (2nd Cir.1981), two co-defendants challenged their convictions of obstruction of justice and conspiracy, arguing, in part, that the trial judge abused his discretion in failing to take partial verdicts after the jurors indicated, in a series of notes to the court during deliberation, that they had decided some counts against some defendants. Holding that the trial judge had not abused his discretion, in part because the jurors had not sought to return a partial verdict, the court observed that \u201c[t]he difficulties of a jury\u2019s task in reaching unanimous verdicts as to several defendants tried on multiple charg\u00e9s counsel against judicial attempts to structure the course of jury deliberations.\u201d 651 F.2d at 146. The court warned that, in such cases, jurors who are \u201cprohibited from returning a partial verdict as to some defendants ... might mistakenly infer that the individual consideration they had already given to some of the defendants is expected to be reassessed in light of their subsequent deliberations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If the jurors are required to return a partial verdict, however, \u201cthere is a risk that some jurors might mistakenly permit a tentative vote to become an irrevocable final vote and forgo the opportunity to gain new insights concerning the evidence in one defendant\u2019s case from consideration of the same evidence as it bears upon other defendants.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 147.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">Subsequent federal courts of appeal cases have seen a synthesis of the observations in <em>Taylor </em>and <em>DiLapi. </em>In <em>United, States v. Benedict, </em>95 F.3d 17 (8th Cir.1996), a single <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>defendant case, the court held that the jury should not have been instructed to announce partial verdicts on three counts before it ended its deliberation on a remaining closely related conspiracy count. The jury had been deliberating for seven hours when it sent a note saying it had reached verdicts on three counts but was undecided on the last count. Over the defendant\u2019s objection, the court decided to take partial verdicts on the three decided counts and return the jury to deliberate further on the remaining count.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">On appeal, the Eighth Circuit held it was error and an abuse of discretion for the district court to take partial verdicts when the jury \u201chad reached tentative agreement on three of the four counts[,] all implications were that the jury was making progress towards unanimity on the undecided charge[,]\u201d the jury was not deadlocked, neither party requested a partial verdict, the jury was not informed that announcing a partial decision would render those decisions final, and the remaining conspiracy count was closely related to the other three substantive offenses. 95 F.3d at 19-20. Citing <em>DiLapi </em>and quoting <em>Taylor, supra, </em>507 F.2d at 168, the court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-6\">The danger inherent in taking a partial verdict is the premature conversion of a tentative jury vote into an irrevocable one.... It is improper for a trial court to intrude on the jury\u2019s deliberative process in such a way as to cut short its opportunity to fully consider the evidence. Such an intrusion would deprive the defendant of \u201cthe very real benefit of reconsideration and change of mind or heart.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AMk\">95 F.3d at 19 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\"><em>See also United States v.

Floyd, P., </em>415 Mass. 826, 615 N.E.2d 938 (1993), which also addresses the danger of converting a tentative decision into a final, irrevocable one by means of a partial verdict, when a final decision was not intended, is particularly instructive. In that case, a juvenile was charged in delinquency complaints with armed robbery, aggravated rape, and first-degree murder. The case was tried before a jury, which deliberated for six hours, adjourned for the night, resumed deliberation in the morning, and one-half hour later sent a note that said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-5\">\u201cThe jury has reached a guilty verdict on the first two charges, armed robbery and aggravated rape. However, two jurors will change their votes if the conviction on rape has to result in first-degree murder. The jurors are at an impasse on the murder charge. What is the next step?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">415 Mass, at 829, 615 N.E.2d 938. The jurors were assembled in the court room an hour later, and the note was read. At the direction of the judge, partial verdicts were returned on the armed robbery and aggravated rape charges. The judge then ordered the jurors to resume deliberation on the murder charge. The defense counsel objected to the acceptance of the aggravated rape verdict and to being deprived of the right to poll the jury on the partial verdicts. Forty-five minutes after resuming deliberations, the jurors returned a guilty verdict on the murder charge, which they affirmed by poll.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">Reversing the verdicts, the court held that, while the trial court by rule had authority to accept partial verdicts that are unanimous,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>[t]he authority to accept partial verdicts, however, does not encompass the power to accept a tentative or conditional verdict on any criminal charge.

The court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-6\">These principles recognize that, as a practical matter, jurors may agree in the course of deliberations to a tentative compromise on the facts of a case or on the disposition of related charges as they attempt to reach a unanimous agreement. Such tentative or conditional agreements, often forged in the course of intense discussion and negotiation, cannot have the force of a final verdict. \u201cA jury should not be precluded from reconsidering a previous vote on any issue, and the weight of final adjudication should not be given to any jury action that is not returned in a final verdict.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b664-7\"><em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>A Juvenile v.

In any event, \u201c[a]ny doubt on a question of this importance must be resolved in favor of protecting the defendant\u2019s right to a unanimous jury verdict.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 832, 615 N.E.2d 938.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-9\">The cases we have discussed teach that, to satisfy the unanimous consent requirement, a verdict must be unam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>biguous and unconditional and must be final \u2014 in the sense of not being provisional or tentative and, to the contrary, being intended as the last resolution of the issue and not subject to change in further deliberation. A verdict that is tentative, not being by unanimous consent, is defective and not valid. In deciding whether to accept a partial verdict, a trial judge must guard against the danger of transforming a provisional decision into a final verdict. Just as when the total circumstances disclose an ambiguity or qualification in a verdict, when they suggest that the jury has made a tentative decision, the court must not accept the verdict. It should inquire into the jury\u2019s intention <em>vel non </em>that the verdict be final, if such inquiry can be done non-coercively; return the jury for further deliberation; or, if that is not possible and there is manifest necessity, declare a mistrial. Doubt must be resolved in favor of the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to a verdict by unanimous consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">Whether a verdict satisfies the unanimous consent requirement is a question that implicates the defendant\u2019s state constitutional right, as provided in Article 21 of the Declaration of Rights. Accordingly, the issue is a mixed question of law and fact, which we review <em>de novo, </em>considering the totality of the circumstances. <em>See Bishop, supra, </em>341 Md. at 292, 670 A.2d 452 (question of ambiguity in verdict determined <em>de novo </em>by Court of Appeals); <em>Lattisaw, supra, </em>329 Md. at 347, 619 A.2d 548 (question whether verdict was coerced is a mixed question of law and fact subject to <em>de 'novo </em>review).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">We conclude that, in the case at bar, the circumstances surrounding the partial verdicts indicated that they were tentative votes the jurors did not intend to be final, irrevocable verdicts.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">The emergency closure of the courthouse, compounded by one juror\u2019s inability to return for deliberations the following Monday, disrupted and derailed the deliberations midstream, bringing them to an abrupt conclusion. We have found no Maryland case in which a verdict, partial or otherwise, was returned by a jury that was suddenly interrupted when it still <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>was in the process of deliberating. Indeed, <em>Taylor, supra, </em>507 F.2d 166, is the only case in the country we have found in which a verdict was taken based on the <em>last </em>vote the jury took before their deliberations abruptly ended in an emergency.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">In the Maryland cases in which partial verdicts properly were returned, the jurors had reported, outside of an exigent circumstance interrupting them and barring further deliberation, that they had made final decisions on some counts, and were not decided or were deadlocked on others. <em>See Woodson, supra, </em>338 Md. at 325-27, 658 A.2d 272 (jury\u2019s note said they agreed on counts one and three but were deadlocked on count two; court took a partial verdict on count one; after further deliberation, the jury again reported a deadlock on count two; in holding that the defendant could not be reprosecuted on count three, the Court of Appeals commented that the court could have taken a partial verdict on that count, as it had on count one); <em>Harris, supra, </em>160 Md.App. at 87-89, 862 A.2d 516 (jury reported it had decided the second-degree murder and use of a handgun counts but was deadlocked on the first-degree murder count; court took partial verdicts on the second-degree murder and use of a handgun counts and polled jurors; jurors resumed deliberations and later returned guilty verdict on the first-degree murder count); <em>Mayne v. State, </em>45 Md.App. 483, 485-86, 414 A.2d 1 (1980) (jury\u2019s note said that jurors had reached a verdict on counts one and seven but were deadlocked on count two; court took verdict on counts one and seven). The circumstances in which the partial verdicts were returned showed that the jurors, while deliberating on their own timetable, carved out and finally decided certain counts. Those decisions were properly accepted by the trial courts as partial verdicts.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">In this case, by contrast, it cannot be said that the jurors reached final decisions on certain counts while operating on their own deliberative timetable. The jurors were interrupted and brought out from deliberating due to an emergency that required them to leave the courthouse; and upon being told to return three days later to resume their deliberations, one of their members made it known that it would not be possible for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>her to do so. Thus, the deliberation did not end on its own accord as to any count. Moreover, no one on the jury volunteered that a final decision had been made on any count. The status of the jury\u2019s decision making only came out when the court asked the foreperson for a progress report.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">The foreperson\u2019s initial progress report, much like the jury note in <em>Floyd P., supra, </em>415 Mass. 826, 615 N.E.2d 938, showed that, at the point that their deliberation was interrupted, the jurors were engaged in a give-and-take bargaining process in which all but one count had received a 12 to 0 vote, the remaining count had not, and some jurors had expressed a willingness to reconsider the votes they previously had cast. The bargaining process the foreperson described disclosed that the votes cast were intended to be provisional, in that the jurors regarded them to be subject to change as the deliberation continued.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">The later reports by the jury foreperson revealed uncertainty about the number of counts that had received a 12 to 0 vote during deliberation. After first reporting that there was a 12 to 0 vote on all but one count, the foreperson reported that the votes had been 12 to 0 in all but two counts. Defense counsel complained during the interlude between reports that there was commotion in the jury box and that the jurors actually were discussing the case in the jury box \u2014 essentially, that they were continuing to deliberate while the court and the lawyers were dealing with the emergency circumstances that had arisen and discussing how to handle them.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">During the poll, the uncertainty and confusion about the finality of the verdicts escalated. The foreperson at first announced a guilty verdict on attempted second-degree murder in the Jackson case, and then, apparently prompted by the reactions of other jurors, changed the announcement on that count to no verdict. The total number of counts announced as \u201cno verdict\u201d was three' \u2014 not one, or two, as first reported and then amended by the foreperson at the bench \u2014 and the \u201cno verdict\u201d counts were in both the Jackson <em>and </em>the Nelson cases, not just in the Jackson case, as originally reported.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>The totality of the circumstances leading up to and surrounding the taking of the partial verdicts in this case raised considerable doubt as to whether, before being called into the courtroom, the jurors had reached final verdicts, by unanimous consent, on the counts on which the partial verdicts then were taken. The jurors had not finished deliberating; they were engaged in a bargaining process in making their decisions that contemplated reconsideration; and the foreperson did not give consistent or clear information in response to questions from the court about the progress of decisions in the jury room. The decisions that at first were communicated by the foreperson to the judge were not the same decisions as later reported, as given during the announcement of the verdict, or as polled. They evolved after the jury was in the courtroom, further showing their provisional nature. The evolution coincided with, and lent support to, defense counsel\u2019s complaint that deliberation was continuing in the jury box.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">While it is possible that the jurors only were discussing the numbers of the counts they had agreed on, the changing reports about their decision points away from that conclusion. In any event, we agree with the court in <em>Floyd P., supra, </em>415 Mass, at 832, 615 N.E.2d 938, that doubt on this point must be resolved in favor of the appellant\u2019s constitutional right to a verdict by unanimous consent, and therefore in favor of a conclusion that the jury had not reached other than provisional agreements that could not be made final by taking partial verdicts.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">The State is correct that the jurors were instructed that their verdict on each count was to be separately decided, by a unanimous vote. As we have explained, however, unanimity embraces the concept of finality, in the sense of not being tentative or provisional or subject to reconsideration. Jurors may cast votes in the jury room that are 12 to 0; however, because such votes are not meant to be irrevocable, they are not unanimous verdicts. With respect to the State\u2019s polling argument, as we already have explained, a verdict that is defective is not cured by polling or hearkening. The partial verdicts taken in this case were defective, because they were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>not final decisions and therefore did not meet the requirement of unanimous consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-4\">Finally, while we conclude that it was error for the trial court to accept the partial verdicts, we do not agree that the trial court took any action to coerce the verdicts. To the contrary, deliberation conducted after the announcement of an emergency closure of the courthouse would have been a deliberation in a coercive environment.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">\n<em>Did the trial court err by declaring a mistrial on three counts?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\"> The Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution protects persons against twice being put in jeopardy for the same offense. Jeopardy attaches in a jury trial when the jury is sworn. <em>See Illinois v. Somerville, </em>410 U.S. 458, 467, 93 S.Ct. 1066, 35 L.Ed.2d 425 (1973); <em>Woodson, supra, </em>338 Md. at 329, 658 A.2d 272. In the mistrial/retrial variety of double jeopardy protection, when a mistrial is granted at the request of the State, or is granted by the court <em>sua sponte, </em>as happened here, retrial is barred unless there was \u201cmanifest necessity\u201d for the mistrial. <em>Arizona v. Washington, </em>434 U.S. 497, 506, 98 S.Ct. 824, 54 L.Ed.2d 717 (1978); <em>State v. Crutchfield, </em>318 Md. 200, 207, 567 A.2d 449 (1989) (citing <em>Cornish v. State, </em>272 Md. 312, 322 A.2d 880 (1974)); <em>see also Malik v. State, </em>152 Md.App. 305, 328, 831 A.2d 1101 (2003). This variety of double jeopardy protection preserves the defendant\u2019s \u201cvalued right to have his trial completed by a particular tribunal.\u201d <em>In re Mark R., </em>294 Md. 244, 249, 449 A.2d 393 (1982). <em>See also Wade v. Hunter, </em>336 U.S. 684, 688, 69 S.Ct. 834, 93 L.Ed. 974 (1949); <em>State v. Gorwell, </em>339 Md. 203, 217, 661 A.2d 718 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-8\">The appellant maintains that the trial court deprived him of his fundamental right to a jury trial by not keeping the jurors in the courthouse to deliberate until they reached a final verdict on all counts. This contention functionally is a challenge to the trial court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>decision to grant a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>mistrial on the three counts on which it granted a mistrial. The court did not keep the jurors in the courthouse to deliberate on those counts because it granted a mistrial on those counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">As to those three counts, however, there are no final judgments. The jurors did not return verdicts on those counts. We do not know at this juncture whether the State will re-prosecute the appellant on those counts. If and when it does so, the double jeopardy issue \u2014 whether the judge properly declared a mistrial on those three counts based on manifest necessity \u2014 can be raised by motion to dismiss.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The issue is not properly before us for decision at this juncture, however.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">\n<em>Must the docket entities be amended to reflect a not guilty verdict on the attempted flrst-degree murder charge in the Nelson case?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b670-8\">The docket entry and the transcript are in conflict as to the verdict on the charge of attempted first-degree murder of Nelson. The transcript reflects that the jury returned, and the clerk recorded, a not guilty verdict on this charge. The docket entry reflects a guilty verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-9\">The appellant argues that, under <em>Carey v. Chessie Computer Services, Inc., </em>369 Md. 741, 748 n. 3, 802 A.2d 1060 (2002), when there is a discrepancy between the transcript and a docket entry, the transcript controls and the docket entry must be corrected accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-10\">The State concedes that the docket entry must be corrected \u25a0 to reflect that the appellant was acquitted of the charge of attempted flrst-degree murder of Nelson.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>When there is a conflict between the docket entries and the transcript, the transcript, \u201cunless shown to be in error, takes precedence over the docket entries.\u201d <em>Shade v. State, </em>18 Md.App. 407, 411, 306 A.2d 560 (1973); <em>see Jackson v. State, </em>68 Md.App. 679, 687-88, 515 A.2d 768 (1986). Additionally, if necessary, \u201cthe docket will be corrected.\u201d <em>Carey, supra, </em>369 Md. at 748 n. 3, 802 A.2d 1060 (citing <em>Waller v. Md. Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>332 Md. 375, 379, 631 A.2d 447 (1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">The transcript in fact reflects that a not guilty verdict was announced on the charge of attempted first-degree murder of Nelson:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-6\">THE CLERK: [D]o you find that the Defendant, Corey Caldwell did attempt to kill and murder Dar\u00edan Nelson in the first-degree, not guilty or guilty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-7\">JUROR: Not guilty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b671-8\">The handwritten and printed docket sheets nevertheless both reflect that a guilty verdict was announced on the charge of attempted first-degree murder of Nelson. Plainly, these entries were clerical errors. The verdict on that count as announced by the foreperson, polled, and hearkened, was not guilty. Accordingly, we direct the clerk to amend the docket entries to reflect the not guilty verdict that the jury announced on the charge of attempted first-degree murder of Nelson.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-9\">JUDGMENTS OF CONVICTION IN NELSON AND JACKSON CASES REVERSED; CASES REMANDED TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS AND, IN NELSON CASE, WITH DIRECTIONS TO AMEND THE DOCKET ENTRIES TO REFLECT A NOT GUILTY VERDICT ON ATTEMPTED FIRST-DEGREE MURDER COUNT. COSTS TO BE PAID BY THE MAYOR AND CITY COUNCIL OF BALTIMORE.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-10\">ON MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION</p>\n<p id=\"b671-11\">In a motion for reconsideration, the State asks that we reverse the judgment of acquittal of attempted first-degree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>murder in the Nelson case, on the same ground that we are reversing the judgments of conviction in the Nelson and Jackson cases. The State reasons that, because we found all the partial verdicts defective, due to their being tentative and not final, we should reverse the judgments of conviction <em>and </em>the judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">Supreme Court double jeopardy jurisprudence draws a distinction between retrial after conviction and retrial after acquittal, however. \u201cAn acquittal is accorded special weight.\u201d <em>United States v. DiFrancesco, </em>449 U.S. 117, 129, 101 S.Ct. 426, 66 L.Ed.2d 328 (1980). If legal error was committed at the trial, resulting in reversal of a conviction, double jeopardy does not bar retrial (in the absence of insufficient evidence). <em>North Carolina v. Pearce, </em>395 U.S. 711, 720, 89 S.Ct. 2072, 23 L.Ed.2d 656 (1969). By contrast, even if legal error was committed at the trial, a retrial will be prevented by an acquittal. <em>United States v. Ball, </em>163 U.S. 662, 16 S.Ct. 1192, 41 L.Ed. 300 (1896).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-6\">\u201cThe constitutional protection against double jeopardy unequivocally prohibits a second trial following an acquittal,\u201d for the \u201cpublic interest in the finality of criminal judgments is so strong that an acquitted defendant may not.be retried even though \u2018the acquittal was based upon an egregiously erroneous foundation.\u2019 \u201d <em>See Fong Foo v. United States, </em>369 U.S. 141, 143, 82 S.Ct. 671, 672, 7 L.Ed.2d 629. If the innocence of the accused has been confirmed by a final judgment, the Constitution conclusively presumes that a second trial would be unfair. <em>Arizona v. Washington, </em>434 U.S. [497], at 503[, 98 S.Ct. 824, 54 L.Ed.2d 717 (1978) ].... The law \u201cattaches particular significance to an acquittal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ADk\"><em>DiFrancesco, supra, </em>at 129, 101 S.Ct. 426 (quoting <em>United States v. Scott, </em>437 U.S. 82, 91, 98 S.Ct. 2187, 57 L.Ed.2d 65 (1978)).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">Moreover, under Maryland common law,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-8\">From the earliest days, it has been clear that once a verdict of not guilty has been rendered at the conclusion of a criminal trial, that verdict is final and cannot be set aside. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>Any attempt to do so by the prosecutor is barred by what at common law was the plea of <em>autrefois acquit.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b673-4\"><em>Pugh v. State, </em>271 Md. 701, 705, 319 A.2d 542 (1974). A verdict of acquittal after trial never can be set aside upon application of the prosecutor, whether it was based on a mistake of law or a mistake of fact. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>State v. Shields, </em>49 Md. 301, 303 (1878)). <em>See also Farrell v. State, </em>364 Md. 499, 506-07, 774 A.2d 387 (2001); <em>Stuckey v. State, </em>141 Md.App. 143, 162-63, 784 A.2d 652 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">In the case at bar, we have held that the circuit court committed legal error in taking the partial verdicts in this case, all of which were convictions, except the acquittal on attempted first-degree murder in the Nelson case. For the reasons explained above, the judgment of acquittal remains notwithstanding that it, too, was the product of legal error. Accordingly, the State\u2019s motion for reconsideration is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b642-9\">. The appellant was sentenced to concurrent 25-year prison terms for the first-degree assault convictions; concurrent 20-year prison terms, the first five years \u25a0 without the possibility of parole, for the use of a handgun convictions, to be served concurrent to the first-degree assault sentences; and concurrent 5-year prison terms for the reckless endangerment convictions, to be served concurrent to the first-degree assault convictions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b646-7\">.

In federal criminal cases, the requirement of unanimity applies by reason of federal rule and by reason of the Sixth Amendment. <em>Andres v. United States, </em>333 U.S. 740, 748, 68 S.Ct. 880, 92 L.Ed. 1055 (1948). However, the Supreme Court has held that the Sixth Amendment\u2019s unanimity requirement does not apply to state criminal prosecutions. <em>Apodaca v. Oregon, </em>406 U.S. 404, 410-12, 92 S.Ct. 1628, 32 L.Ed.2d 184 (1972) (holding that a state law providing that a criminal defendant could be convicted by a non-unanimous verdict, as long as ten jurors agreed, did not violate the Sixth Amendment). <em>See also Johnson v.
