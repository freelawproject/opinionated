The plaintiffs are the owners and publishers of a weekly publication known as \u201cTV Facts.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cTV Facts\u201d contains television listings for the coming week and also contains features found in \u201c \u2018shoppers\u2019 publications,\u2019 \u201d including an entertainment world gossip column, a crossword puzzle and an astrology column. \u201cTV Facts\u201d contains no articles of opinion, such as editorials, advocates no opinions, and does not carry items of general news interest. The Middlesex News Corporation of Framingham, Massachusetts, prints \u201cTV Facts\u201d under contract with the various plaintiffs, who, in turn, distribute the publications. \u201cTV Facts\u201d is distributed weekly to places of business in Connecticut such as grocery stores and drug stores where it is available to the general public. No charge is made either to the stores or to the public for copies of \u201cTV Facts.\u201d The publications are delivered to the plaintiffs by contract or common carrier and are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>distributed by the plaintiffs entirely within Connecticut. If \u201cTV Facts\u201d were mailed through the United States Postal Service, it would be accorded second class postal rates, which are applicable to all newspapers, magazines and periodicals.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">The commissioner of revenue services assessed use taxes against the plaintiffs pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 12-416 (1) and 12-411 (l).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The assessments were based on the estimated amount paid by the plaintiffs when they purchased the \u201cTV Facts\u201d publications in Massachusetts for distribution in Connecticut.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">The plaintiffs timely petitioned the commissioner for a reassessment pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 12-418 (1) and (2)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and requested an oral hearing. Thereafter, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>deputy commissioner, who heard the matter on April 10, 1981, concluded that: (a) the plaintiffs\u2019 purchase of the publications in question from the printer was a purchase of tangible personal property, from a retailer for storage, acceptance, consumption or use in this state as those words are used in \u00a7 12-411 (1) which imposes the use tax; (b) the publications in question do not qualify as \u201cnewspapers\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 12-412 (f) and, therefore, are not exempt from the use tax; and (c) the imposition of the use tax did not violate the first amendment or the commerce or equal protection clauses of the United States constitution. The deputy commissioner affirmed the assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">The plaintiffs filed a timely appeal from the deputy commissioner\u2019s ruling to the Superior Court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 12-422.* ****<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In their appeal, the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>tiffs claimed that their publications were newspapers and that, consequently, they and their publications were exempt from the Connecticut use tax because they were engaged in the \u201cstorage, use or other consumption of newspapers circulated among the public.\u201d They asserted, therefore, that they were entitled to an exemption from the use tax pursuant to \u00a7 12-412 (f), and a reversal of the deputy commissioner\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">The Superior Court by stipulation referred the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal to Hon. Charles S. House, state trial referee, who heard the matter as the trial court. After trial, the trial court reached the following conclusions. \u201cI. The\u2018TV Facts\u2019publications were . . . purchased by the plaintiffs from a retailer in Massachusetts for storage and use in Connecticut and were so stored and used. II. The publications were not \u2018newspapers\u2019 within the meaning of that term as used in General Statutes \u00a7 12-412 (f). . . . III. The imposition of the Connecticut use tax on \u2018TV Facts\u2019 publications [did] not violate the plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional rights. ... IV. The burden of proving any claimed exemption to a tax [was] on the [plaintiffs].\u201d The court affirmed the commissioner\u2019s use tax assessments. The plaintiffs subsequently filed a motion for reargument and to open judgment. After reargument, the trial court denied the motion to open judgment. The plaintiffs appealed to the Appellate Court and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">On appeal, the plaintiffs have not contested the fact that their publications were \u201cused\u201d in Connecticut within the meaning of \u00a7 12-411 (1). The plaintiffs do, however, dispute the court\u2019s conclusion that their publications were not \u201cnewspapers\u201d entitled to a use tax exemption pursuant to \u00a7 12-412 <em>(f). </em>The plaintiffs argue that the court, in concluding that their \u201cTV Facts\u201d publications were not newspapers, misconstrued this court\u2019s decision in <em>Caldor, Inc. </em>v. <em>Heffernan, </em>183 Conn. 566, 440 A.2d 767 (1981). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">In <em>Caldor, Inc., </em>the question addressed was whether advertising inserts were \u201cnewspapers.\u201d This court, after finding that there was no statutory, regulatory or Connecticut case law definition of the word \u201cnewspaper,\u201d determined that the word should be given its plain, ordinary meaning and should be construed according to its commonly approved usage. Id., 570; see <em>Bolt Technology Corporation </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue Services, </em>213 Conn. 220, 228, 567 A.2d 371 (1989); <em>Rosnick </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>172 Conn. 416, 422, 374 A.2d 1076 (1977); <em>Carlson </em>v. <em>Kozlowski, </em>172 Conn. 263, 374 A.2d 207 (1977). We therefore examined dictionaries and case law from other jurisdictions to ascertain that meaning and usage. <em>Caldor, Inc. v. Heffernan, </em>supra, 570-72; <em>see State Medical Society </em>v. <em>Board of Examiners in Podiatry, </em>208 Conn. 709, 717, 546 A.2d 830 (1988); <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>196 Conn. 309, 316, 493 A.2d 846 (1985), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 1063, 106 S. Ct. 813, 88 L. Ed. 2d 787 (1986); <em>Wisconsin Department of Revenues. J. C. Penney Co., </em>108 Wis. 2d 662, 669-71, 323 N.W.2d 168 (1982). We cited two dictionary sources, that defined \u201cnewspaper\u201d in similar fashion as \u201c \u2018a paper that is printed and distributed daily, weekly, or at some other regular and usu. short interval and that contains news, articles of opinion (as editorials), features, advertising <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>or other matters regarded as of current interest . . . Webster, Third New International Dictionary; see Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (5th Ed.) for a similar definition.\u201d <em>Caldor, Inc. </em>v. <em>Heffernan, </em>supra, 571. We also noted that a federal court; <em>Christopher </em>v. <em>American News Co., </em>171 F.2d 275, 281 (7th Cir. 1948); in defining the term \u201cnewspaper\u201d had indicated that among the ingredients of a newspaper were \u201cnews\u201d and \u201copinions.\u201d <em>Caldor, Inc. </em>v. <em>Heffernan, </em>supra. We further cited several other state and federal cases, all of which included \u201cnews\u201d as a component of a newspaper.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Id., 571-72.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">In determining whether the advertising inserts at issue in <em>Caldor, Inc., </em>qualified as \u201cnewspapers,\u201d however, we found it necessary to consider only two \u201ccommon characteristics\u201d of a newspaper that we said were contained in all the definitions. Id., 572. Those characteristics were: \u201c(1) It is published at short, regular intervals, usually not exceeding a week, and (2) it routinely reports a myriad of topics so that it appeals, at least in part, to a wide spectrum of the general public.\u201d Id. Because in <em>Caldor, Inc., </em>there was no stipulation or evidence that the advertising inserts in question appeared at short, regular intervals and because the inserts contained only information regarding Caldor sale items, it was not necessary to discuss other facets of the definition of a newspaper. We did not, however, eschew the dictionary definitions of the word \u201cnewspaper\u201d or those articulated by the courts cited in the opinion, all of which included news as an essential ingredient of what is commonly understood to be a newspaper.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>In fact, not surprisingly, the cases and authorities generally indicate that news is commonly thought to be a necessary component of a newspaper.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Supreme Court of Tennessee, faced with the issue of what constitutes a \u201cnewspaper,\u201d agreed that the criteria in the regulations promulgated by that state\u2019s commissioner of revenue comported with the customarily accepted meaning of the term and determined that, in order to qualify for exemption from the sales and use tax as a \u201cnewspaper,\u201d a publication must contain \u201c \u2018general news of the day, information of current events, [or] news of importance and of current interest to the general public.\u2019 \u201d <em>Shoppers Guide Publishing Co. </em>v. <em>Woods, </em>547 S.W.2d 561, 563 (Tenn. 1977); <em>Memphis Shoppers News, Inc. </em>v. <em>Woods, </em>584 S.W.2d 196, 199 (Tenn. 1979). Other courts confronted with the question, \u201cWhat is a newspaper?\u201d have formulated comparable common sense answers. \u201c[Publications and pennysavers such as the petitioner\u2019s which do not contain news articles or expressions of opinion are generally not newspapers within the meaning of the Tax Law . . . <em>Scotsmen Press </em>v. <em>Tax Appeals Tribunal, </em>165 App. Div. 2d 630, 634, 569 N.Y.S.2d 991 (1991). The applicable test to determine whether a publication is a newspaper is one of \u201c \u2018common understanding.\u2019 \u201d If \u201c[t]here are no news articles or expressions of opinion,\u201d a publication is not a newspaper. <em>Twin Coast Newspapers, Inc. </em>v. <em>State Tax Commission, </em>101 App. Div. 2d 977, 477 N.Y.S.2d 718 (1984). \u201cIn distinguishing between a newspaper and a shopper for purposes of the exemption, the question is whether the primary purpose of the publication is the dissemination of news or the advertising of business concerns.\u201d <em>Campus Communications </em>v. <em>Department of Revenue, </em>473 So. 2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>1290, 1295 (Fla. 1985).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u201cIn the ordinary understanding, a newspaper may be defined generally as a publication . . . containing news, that is, reports of happenings of recent occurrence and of varied character, including political, social, moral, religious, and other subjects of similar nature, local or foreign, and intended for the information of the general reader.\u201d 58 Am. Jur. 2d, Newspapers, Etc. \u00a7 1; see also 66 C.J.S., Newspapers \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">An examination of the format of the plaintiffs\u2019 publications reveals that they do not fit within the common understanding of what one would envision as a newspaper. Although the plaintiffs\u2019 publications contain some \u201cfeatures\u201d as well as television listings, they do not \u201croutinely report a myriad of topics\u201d as contemplated by the test in <em>Caldor, Inc., </em>and certainly do not contain what is generally thought to be news. Moreover, the primary purpose of the plaintiffs\u2019 publication is obviously not the dissemination of news but the advertising of business concerns. The mere publication of universally available television listings and some \u201cfeatures\u201d do not make a newspaper. See <em>Matter of Assessment of Additional North Carolina and Orange County Use Taxes Against Village Publishing Corporation, </em>312 N.C. 211, 322 S.E.2d 155 (1984), appeal dismissed, 472 U.S. 1001, 105 S. Ct. 2693, 86 L. Ed. 2d 710 (1985). We conclude that if we afford the word \u201cnewspaper\u201d its commonly accepted meaning, as we must in the absence of a clearly expressed legislative intent to the contrary, then the plaintiffs\u2019 publications <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>are not \u201cnewspapers\u201d and, therefore, are not entitled to the exemption accorded \u201cnewspapers\u201d by \u00a7 12-412 (f). See <em>Kilpatrick </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>206 Conn. 25, 28, 535 A.2d 1311 (1988); <em>Ganim </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>204 Conn. 760, 763, 529 A.2d 194 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">The plaintiffs next contend that the trial court improperly concluded \u201cthat the commissioner was permitted to apply a content-based test as the basis for denying the newspaper exemption to [the plaintiffs\u2019] publications, in violation of first and fourteenth amendment guarantees of freedom of the press.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">The trial of a sales and use tax appeal taken pursuant to \u00a7 12-422 is a trial de novo. <em>Kimberly-Clark Corporation </em>v. <em>Dubno, </em>204 Conn. 137, 145, 527 A.2d 679 (1987). To state, therefore, that the commissioner \u201cwas permitted\u201d by the trial court to do anything is to misconstrue the proceeding. The commissioner had already acted when this matter was before the trial court and it was simply the function of the trial court to determine the legality of that action. It is the trial court\u2019s decision that is appealed from, not that of the commissioner, and it is the trial court\u2019s decision that we review.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">The trial court concluded that the plaintiffs\u2019 \u201cpublications were not \u2018newspapers\u2019 within the meaning of that term as used in General Statutes Section 12-412 (f) . . . .\u201d For that conclusion the court cited <em>Caldor, Inc. </em>v. <em>Heffernan, </em>supra, 570-71, and an annotation in 25 A.L.R.4th 750, entitled \u201cWhat constitutes newspapers, magazines, periodicals, or the like, under sales or use tax law exemption.\u201d A review of those citations clearly reveals that the trial court based its decision not on the content of the plaintiffs\u2019 publications but rather the absence of most of the features usually found in newspapers. Neither <em>Caldor, Inc., </em>nor the cases cited in 25 A.L.R.4th 750, discuss the content or viewpoint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>of any material that appears in any publication but rather discuss the type of material, regardless of its content or viewpoint, that must appear in a publication to have it constitute a newspaper. For example, a universal requirement for a newspaper is that it contain news.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">Clearly, the trial court determined that \u201cTV Facts\u201d lacked essential ingredients in its form to constitute a newspaper under the statute. There is certainly no indication that it based its conclusion on the content or viewpoint of any material that appeared in the plaintiffs\u2019 publications. In fact, a discussion of the content of any of the material that appeared in \u201cTV Facts\u201d is conspicuous by its absence. The trial court simply found differences between the plaintiffs\u2019 publications and what is ordinarily understood to be a newspaper based on noncontent factors. <em>Hearst Corporation </em>v. <em>Iowa Department of Revenue &amp; Finance, </em>461 N.W.2d 295, 301 (Iowa 1990). We find no merit to this claim of the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">We next address the plaintiffs\u2019 claims that disallowing the exemption provided by \u00a7 12-412 (f) to their publications denied them their constitutionally guaranteed rights of freedom of the press and equal protection of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b199-9\">It should first be made clear that the first amendment \u201cdoes not prohibit all [government] regulation of the press.\u201d <em>Minneapolis Star &amp; Tribune </em>v. <em>Minnesota Commissioner of Revenue, </em>460 U.S. 575, 581, 103 S. Ct. 1365, 75 L. Ed. 2d 295 (1983); <em>Hope Evangelical Lutheran Church </em>v. <em>Iowa Department of Revenue &amp; Finance, </em>463 N.W.2d 76 (Iowa 1990), cert. denied, U.S. , 111 S. Ct. 1585, 113 L. Ed. 2d 649 (1991). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>Generally applicable economic regulations may be imposed on the press by the states and the federal government without causing constitutional problems. <em>Jimmy Swaggart Ministries </em>v. <em>Board of Equalization, </em>493 U.S. 378, 392, 110 S. Ct. 688, 107 L. Ed. 2d 796 (1990); <em>Minneapolis Star &amp; Tribune </em>v. <em>Minnesota Commissioner of Revenue, </em>supra, 581. Further, the first amendment is not interpreted so broadly as to require that all media need be taxed in the same way. <em>Hearst Corporation </em>v. <em>Iowa Department of Revenue &amp; Finance, </em>supra, 301. It is only when <em>\u201ca </em>discriminatory tax on the press burdens rights protected by the First Amendment\u201d that problems arise. <em>Arkansas Writers\u2019 Project, Inc. </em>v. <em>Ragland, </em>481 U.S. 221, 227, 107 S. Ct. 1722, 95 L. Ed. 2d 209 (1987). A legislature cannot enact a special tax that applies only to the press or that singles out and taxes exclusively a small group of publications, or that taxes publications on the basis of their content, without shouldering the heavy burden of demonstrating that its action is necessary to serve a compelling state interest and is narrowly drawn to achieve that end. <em>Leathers </em>v. <em>Medlock, </em>499 U.S. , 111 S. Ct. 1438, 1445, 113 L. Ed. 2d 494 (1991); <em>Arkansas Writers\u2019 Project, Inc. </em>v. <em>Ragland, </em>supra, 228; <em>Minneapolis Star &amp; Tribune </em>v. <em>Minnesota Commissioner of Revenue, </em>supra, 581, 591. The United States Supreme Court has found that there exists too great a potential for abuse if the states are permitted to tax the press exclusively or to tax selected members of the press. <em>Minneapolis Star &amp; Tribune </em>v. <em>Minnesota Commissioner of Revenue, </em>supra, 592. Such selective taxation \u201cis constitutionally suspect when it threatens to suppress the expression of particular ideas or viewpoints.\u201d <em>Leathers </em>v. <em>Medlock, </em>supra, 1443.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">Connecticut sales and use tax legislation does not, however, fashion a tax that is applicable only to the press or to certain publications or that singles out and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>taxes exclusively a small group of publications, or that taxes on the basis of content. To the contrary, the Connecticut sales and use tax is a broad based, generally applicable tax that, for the most part, taxes the gross receipts from all retail sales of tangible personal property and the use or storage of all personal property in this state, including most publications. See General Statutes c. 219. There is no indication that Connecticut has targeted the media or publications such as the plaintiffs\u2019 in a purposeful attempt to interfere with their first amendment activities. Nor is the tax one that is structured to raise suspicion that it was intended to do so. Unlike the taxes that the United States Supreme Court has invalidated as too selective, the Connecticut sales and use tax is a general tax that \u201chas not selected a narrow group to bear fully the burden of the tax.\u201d <em>Leathers </em>v. <em>Medlock, </em>supra, 1444; see <em>Arkansas Writers\u2019 Project, Inc. </em>v. <em>Ragland, </em>supra, 228; <em>Minneapolis Star &amp; Tribune </em>v. <em>Minnesota Commissioner of Revenue, </em>supra, 575; <em>Grosjean </em>v. <em>American Press Co., </em>297 U.S. 233, 56 S. Ct. 444, 80 L. Ed. 660 (1936). \u201cWhen the state imposes a generally applicable tax, there is little cause for concern. We need not fear that a government will destroy a selected group of taxpayers by burdensome taxation if it must impose the same burden on the rest of its constituency. See <em>Railway Express Agency, Inc. </em>v. <em>New York, </em>336 U.S. 106, 112-13, 69 S. Ct. 463, 467, 93 L. Ed. 533 (1949) (Jackson, J., concurring.)\u201d <em>Minneapolis Star &amp; Tribune </em>v. <em>Minnesota Commissioner of Revenue, </em>supra, 585. Because the Connecticut use tax has not singled out the press, \u201c[it] does not therefore threaten to hinder the press as a watchdog of government activity.\u201d <em>Leathers </em>v. <em>Medlock, </em>supra, 1444.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">Moreover, the fact that \u201cnewspapers\u201d are the beneficiaries of an exemption from the sales and use tax does not mean that all other publications must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>extended the same subsidy or a first amendment violation results.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Hearst Corporation </em>v. <em>Iowa Department of Revenue &amp; </em>Finance, supra, 303-304. While government may not deny a benefit to a person because he exercises a constitutional right; see <em>Perry </em>v. <em>Sindermann, </em>408 U.S. 593, 597, 92 S. Ct. 2694, 33 L. Ed. 2d 570 (1972); government is not required to subsidize that right. <em>Regan </em>v. <em>Taxation With Representation of Washington, Inc., </em>461 U.S. 540, 545, 103 S. Ct. 1997, 76 L. Ed. 2d 129 (1983); <em>Cammarano </em>v. <em>United States, </em>358 U.S. 498, 513, 79 S. Ct. 524, 3 L. Ed. 2d 462 (1959). Because the government chooses to subsidize one protected right, it does not mean that \u201cit must subsidize analogous counterpart rights.\u201d <em>Rust </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>500 U.S. , 111 S. Ct. 1759, 1773, 114 L. Ed. 2d 233 (1991). Consequently, the legislature may choose to subsidize one form of publication, such as newspapers, by means of a tax exemption without being required by the first amendment to subsidize other forms of publications such as \u201cTV Facts.\u201d See <em>Regan </em>v. <em>Taxation With Representation of Washington, Inc., </em>supra. The \u201c[l]egislature may subsidize one form of publication (i.e., \u2018newspapers\u2019), but is not required by the first amendment to also subsidize other forms of publications as long as it has a rational noncontent basis for doing so.\u201d <em>Hearst Corporation </em>v. <em>Iowa Department of Revenue &amp; Finance, </em>supra, 304. Different taxation of speakers \u201cdoes not implicate the First Amendment unless the tax is directed at, or presents the danger of suppressing, particular ideas.\u201d <em>Leathers </em>v. <em>Medlock, </em>supra, 1447.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">In Connecticut all forms of written media are free to exercise their first amendment privileges without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>interference. The legislature, however, has chosen to favor only newspapers with a sales tax exemption. As long as the legislature had a legitimate noncontent reason for doing so,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the first amendment rights of other publications are not violated. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">In summary, because the Connecticut sales and use tax is a general tax that does not target the media or discriminate among media sources of the same type and therefore does not subject only a small, select number of publications to the tax, and because the exemption contained in the statute is not content based, the tax, which exempts newspapers but not the plaintiffs\u2019 publications, is not a suspect tax. The legislature \u201chas chosen simply to exclude or exempt certain media from a generally applicable tax.\u201d <em>Leathers </em>v. <em>Medlock, </em>supra, 1447. There is nothing in that statutory scheme that suggests censorship or intimates that Connecticut\u2019s broad based, content neutral use tax is likely to stifle the free exchange of ideas. We conclude that exempting newspapers from the generally applicable use tax while not exempting other media does not violate the first amendment. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">The plaintiffs next argue that the extension of a sales and use tax exemption to newspapers but not to their publications violates their constitutional right to equal protection. The first step in confronting the plaintiffs\u2019 equal protection argument is to ascertain whether the rational basis test or the more stringent strict scrutiny test applies. We conclude that it is the rational basis test.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">In tax matters, more so than in other fields, legislatures possess considerable liberty in classification. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number><em>Regan </em>v. <em>Taxation With Representation of Washing</em>ton, <em>Inc., </em>supra, <em>547;Madden v. Kentucky, </em>309 U.S. 83, 87-88, 60 S. Ct. 406, 84 L. Ed. 590 (1940); see also Saw <em>Antonio Independent School District </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>411 U.S. 1, 40-41, 93 S. Ct. 1278, 36 L.

Ed. 2d 678 (1973). \u201cGenerally, statutory classifications [as to what is or is not to be taxed, such as that created by \u00a7 12-412 (f),] are valid if they bear a rational relation to a legitimate governmental purpose. <em>Regan </em>[v. <em>Taxation With Representation of Washington, Inc., </em>supra,] 547 . . . <em>Hearst Corporation </em>v. <em>Iowa Department of Revenue &amp; Finance, </em>supra, 305. If a subsidy in the form of a tax exemption is granted to a particular variety of publication such as newspapers, as long as the exemption is not aimed at the suppression of ideas, and does not interfere with the fundamental rights of those publications not exempted, the legislature has broad power to encourage action deemed to be in the public interest. Furthermore, as noted earlier, all publications do not have to be afforded the same exemption. See <em>Regan </em>v. <em>Taxation With Representation of Washington, Inc., </em>supra, 550; see also <em>Maher </em>v. <em>Roe, </em>432 U.S. 464, 476, 97 S. Ct. 2376, 53 L. Ed. 2d 484 (1977); <em>Hearst Corporation </em>v. <em>Iowa Department of Revenue &amp; Finance, </em>supra, 305. \u201cStrict scrutiny is not required whenever the legislature subsidizes some speech but not all speech.\u201d <em>Regan </em>v. <em>Taxation with Representation of Washington, Inc., </em>supra, 548. \u201c[A] legislature\u2019s decision not to subsidize the exercise of a fundamental right does not infringe the right, and thus is not subject to strict scrutiny. <em>Buckley </em>v. <em>Valeo, </em>[424 U.S. 1, 96 S. Ct. 612, 46 L. Ed. 2d 659 (1976)].\u201d Id., 549. Therefore, the legislature\u2019s decision to subsidize newspapers by means of a tax exemption, but not to subsidize other forms of publications such as the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>tiffs\u2019, does not require strict scrutiny but, rather, is subject to review under the rational basis standard. Id., 548-49.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">Under that standard, a legislatively enacted sales and use tax exemption will withstand judicial scrutiny if it bears a rational relationship to a legitimate government purpose. We determine that the newspaper exemption of \u00a7 12-412 (f) possesses that rational relationship. The state has a legitimate interest in encouraging the inexpensive and wide dissemination of newspapers in order that its citizens might read about and be informed of current affairs, and thereby become more cognizant of, among other things, the workings of their government. Newspapers also enhance the general knowledge of the populace and contribute to its literacy. Therefore, to make newspapers available at the lowest possible price is a legitimate government purpose to which the sales and use tax exemption for newspapers bears a rational relationship. <em>See Hearst Corporation </em>v. <em>Iowa Department of Revenue &amp; </em>Finance, supra, 306. We find no merit in the plaintiffs\u2019 equal protection claim.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">Finally, the plaintiffs argue that the trial referee was incorrect in placing upon them the burden of proving that they were entitled to the claimed exemption. It is the plaintiffs\u2019 contention that the burden of justifying the tax should have been upon the commissioner. The plaintiffs\u2019 argument is premised on their contention that the commissioner\u2019s denial of a use tax exemption for their publications was based on their content <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>and that the denial of the exemption created a tax that targeted a small, select group of \u201cnewspapers.\u201d See <em>Arkansas Writers\u2019Project, Inc. </em>v. <em>Ragland, </em>supra, 231, 234. Since we have determined that the denial of the exemption was not content based and that the plaintiffs\u2019 publications are not \u201cnewspapers,\u201d the plaintiffs\u2019 argument has no merit. We conclude, therefore, that the trial court was correct when it strictly construed the statute against the plaintiffs and placed upon them the burden of proving that the assessment was in error. <em>Stop \u2019N Save, Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Revenue Services, </em>212 Conn. 454, 462, 562 A.2d 512 (1989).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b189-11\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1981) \u00a7 12-412 (f) provides in pertinent part: \u201cexemptions.

The first two are Tennessee cases decided by the Tennessee Supreme Court on the same day. See <em>Southern Living, Inc. </em>v. <em>Celauro, </em>789 S.W.2d 251 (Tenn. 1990), cert. denied, U.S. , 111 S. Ct. 1639, 113 L.

Those cases were decided on analogous facts and issues. The issue was whether a sales and use tax exemption afforded newspapers but not magazines violated the first amendment rights of the magazine publishers. The Tennessee Supreme Court determined that any distinction between newspapers and magazines was necessarily \u201ccontent based\u201d and therefore placed a heavy burden on the state to prove a compelling justification for the selective content based taxation of the plaintiffs\u2019 publications. The court determined that such a justification was not demonstrated and therefore held that the tax was unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">In this case, we have determined that the distinction drawn by the trial referee between the plaintiffs\u2019 publications and newspapers was not content based and that the state was required to show only a rational relationship between the use tax exemption and a legitimate government purpose. The cases, therefore, are distinguishable. Moreover, we do not necessarily agree with the Tennessee court that a distinction cannot be drawn between a magazine and a newspaper based on form rather than content and that the legislature may not opt to tax one and not the other without creating a first amendment violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">The third case relied on by the plaintiffs is <em>Department of Revenue </em>v. <em>Magazine Publishers of America, Inc., </em>565 So. 2d 1304 (Fla. 1990), decided by the Florida Supreme Court. Therein the court concluded simply that a sales and use tax statute that differentiated between newspapers and magazines burdened first amendment rights and was unconstitutional in the absence of a showing that such differential treatment was necessary to serve a compelling state interest and was narrowly drawn to achieve that end. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>department of revenue services applied for a writ of certiorari to the United States Supreme Court. The court granted the writ and remanded the case to the Florida Supreme Court for further consideration in light of <em>Leathers </em>v. <em>Medlock, </em>499 U.S. , 111 S. Ct. 1438, 113 L. Ed. 2d 494 (1991). <em>Department of Revenue </em>v. <em>Magazine Publishers of America, Inc., </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-12\"><em>Leathers </em>held that a differential burden on speakers is insufficient to raise first amendment concerns and that a differential tax even between members of the same medium does not implicate the first amendment unless the tax is directed at, or presents the danger of suppressing particular ideas. <em>Leathers </em>v. <em>Medlock, </em>supra, 1445. The remand, therefore, appears to portend a different result. We are unpersuaded.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
