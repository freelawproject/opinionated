The plaintiff, Alice Freeman, brought an action for damages against the defendants, Alamo Management Company, and Dwayne Boise, to recover for the forcible entry into her apartment and the wrongful disposition of her personal property. The trial court rendered judgment in favor of the plaintiff both on her claim and on the defendants\u2019 counterclaim, and awarded her damages in the amount of $14,000. The defendants appealed to the Appellate Court, which reversed the judgment in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>part, and remanded the case for a retrial on damages only, ruling that the plaintiff was required to establish a statutory violation by clear and convincing evidence in order to recover statutory double damages. We granted certification<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and now reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">The Appellate Court based its decision upon the following facts found by the trial court. \u201cOn October 15, 1987, the plaintiff conveyed title to a three-family house located at 123-125 Pearl Street, Waterbury, to the defendant Alamo Management Company (Alamo). The plaintiff had occupied the first floor apartment. Before the closing, she attempted to enter into a use and occupancy agreement with Alamo because she was unable to find another apartment. Although this agreement never materialized, she remained in possession of the first floor apartment after the closing. She moved some of her belongings to a storage area, but left the balance of her appliances and personal property on the premises while she looked for a larger storage unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">\u201cAlamo entered into an agreement to sell the premises to a third party. The new buyer had a mortgage commitment on November 26, 1987. On Saturday, November 28,1987, the defendant Dwayne Boise, acting as an agent of the defendant Alamo, forcibly entered the plaintiff\u2019s apartment and began to remove her property. When the plaintiff arrrived, Boise refused to allow her to enter the apartment. Her appliances were set aside so that she could pick them up the fol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>lowing Monday, but her other personal property was strewn about the yard or thrown in a dump truck for disposal.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">\u201cThe trial court also found (1) that because the plaintiffs original possession of the premises was rightful, the only proper mode of eviction available to the defendants was that of summary process, (2) that the plaintiff had not abandoned the premises, (3) that the defendant Boise violated General Statutes \u00a7 47a-43 (a) (3) when he forcibly entered the plaintiffs apartment, removed her personal property, and disposed of it, [and] (4) that the plaintiff was entitled to double damages pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 47a-46 in the amount of $14,000. . . .\u201d <em>Freeman </em>v. <em>Alamo Management Co., </em>24 Conn. App. 124, 126-27, 586 A.2d 619 (1991).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">The Appellate Court reversed the trial court\u2019s award of double damages. Id., 135. Because violation of the entry and detainer statute \u201cinvolves willful, wrongful and unlawful acts,\u201d and because the penalty of double damages is \u201ca remedy with serious consequences to an individual\u201d; id., 130; the Appellate Court reasoned that it would be inappropriate to determine by the \u201cpreponderance of the evidence\u201d standard whether that remedy should be imposed. That standard, which apparently was relied on by the trial court, \u201cindicates that the litigants should share equally the risk of error . . . because the interests at stake have roughly equal societal importance.\u201d Id. In contrast, the Appellate Court noted, the \u201cproof beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d standard, which is employed in criminal cases, \u201cimplies that the party on whom that burden is imposed should bear almost the entire risk of error.\u201d Id. The Appellate Court held that the appropriate standard for determining whether double damages should be imposed was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>\u201c[p]roof by \u2018clear and convincing\u2019 evidence [which] is an intermediate standard generally used in civil cases involving allegations of fraud or some other quasi-criminal wrongdoing, or when particularly important individual rights are involved.\u201d Id., 131. Concluding that \u201cif the evidence [of the underlying statutory violation] satisfies only the fair preponderance standard, damages cannot be doubled\u201d; id.; it remanded the case for a new trial limited to the issue of whether double damages should be imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">Both the plaintiff and the defendants requested our review of this judgment. The plaintiff maintains that the trial court imposed the proper standard of proof, while the defendants, on their cross appeal, claim that a new trial should encompass the issue of liability as well as the issue of damages. Because we agree with the plaintiff\u2019s contention that the preponderance of the evidence standard governs this case, and therefore conclude that a new trial is not required, we need not consider the defendants\u2019 claims about the scope of such a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">As the Appellate Court noted, the issue of what standard of proof is required for double damages pursuant to \u00a7 47a-46 appears to be one of first impression, and the statute is silent on the question. <em>Freeman </em>v. <em>Alamo Management Co., </em>supra, 24 Conn. App. 129. The preponderance of the evidence standard is appropriate in ordinary tort cases because the litigants should \u201c \u2018share the risk of error in roughly equal fashion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Santosky </em>v. <em>Kramer, </em>455 U.S. 745, 755, 102 S. Ct. 1388, 71 L. Ed. 2d 599 (1982). The Appellate Court took the view that, for punitive damages, the more exacting standard of clear and convincing evidence should govern. That standard requires \u201cthat degree of belief that lies between the belief that is required to find the truth or existence of the issuable fact in an ordinary civil action and the belief that is required to find guilt in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>criminal prosecution. . . . [T]he burden of persuasion is sustained if the evidence induces in the mind of the trier a reasonable belief that the facts asserted are highly probably true, that the probability that they are true or exist is substantially greater than the probability that they are false or do not exist.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Bonello, </em>210 Conn. 51, 66, 554 A.2d 277, cert. denied, 490 U.S. 1082, 109 S. Ct. 3268, 106 L. Ed. 2d 612 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">The argument for a high standard of proof for punitive damages is that \u201c[t]he interests that the parties have at stake in a punitive damages case are not similarly equal. If punitive damages are imposed improperly, or in an excessive amount, the defendant suffers far more than a plaintiff does if the jury incorrectly fails to impose them. The interests at stake are different in two respects. The defendant, unlike the plaintiff, suffers a stigma that may be permanent; and the plaintiff, unlike the defendant, has little or no legitimate personal interest in a correct result. As courts have uniformly held, no plaintiff has a right to punitive damages: the purpose of punitive damages is to vindicate the public interest, not that of a particular plaintiff.\u201d M. Wheeler, \u201cThe Constitutional Case for Reforming Punitive Damages Procedures,\u201d 69 Va. L. Rev. 269, 292 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">A number of jurisdictions require clear and convincing evidence for the award of punitive damages.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See J. Ghiardi &amp; J. Kircher, Punitive Damages Law and Practice (1985 &amp; Sup. 1991) \u00a7 9.12; annot., Standard of Proof as to Conduct Underlying Punitive Damages Awards\u2014Modern Status, 58 A.L.R.4th 878 (1987 <em>&amp; </em>Sup. 1991). Most of these jurisdictions, however, have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>adopted this standard by statute rather than by judicial decision; see J. Ghiardi &amp; J. Kircher, supra; and most of these statutes reflect a legislative response to a well publicized, dramatic increase in the size and frequency of punitive damages awards. See <em>Browning-Ferris Industries </em>v. <em>Kelco Disposal, Inc., </em>492 U.S. 257, 282-83, 109 S. Ct. 2909, 106 L. Ed. 2d 219 (1989) (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part); D. Owen, \u201cProblems in Assessing Punitive Damages Against Manufacturers of Defective Products,\u201d 49 U. Chi. L. Rev. 1, 59 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">Whatever the validity of the concerns about boundless punitive damages may be elsewhere, the risk of unfair and excessive punitive damages awards is substantially limited in this state by routine constraints on the amount of punitive damages. \u201cThe Connecticut courts have . . . consistently limited punitive or exemplary damage awards in Connecticut to costs in excess of taxable costs.\u201d 6 Connecticut Practice, J. Fitzgerald &amp; R. Yules, Connecticut Trial Practice (1987) \u00a7 5.19, p. 196; see <em>Markey </em>v. <em>Santangelo, </em>195 Conn. 76, 80, 485 A.2d 1305 (1985); <em>Collens </em>v. <em>New Canaan Water Co., </em>155 Conn. 477, 488, 234 A.2d 825 (1967). There are statutory exceptions to this ride, such as \u00a7 47a-46, which is at issue in this case.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The legislature has not, however, established any statutory linkage between a right to recover punitive damages and a higher standard of proof. See J. Fitzgerald &amp; R. Yules, supra, \u00a7 5.20 (listing statutes); see also <em>Munson </em>v. <em>Atwood, </em>30 Conn. 102 (1861). Recently, in undertaking product lia<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>bility reform, the General Assembly expressly rejected a proposal to adopt the clear and convincing evidence standard for awarding punitive damages,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and elected instead to cap the amount of punitive damages and to have that amount be determined by the judge.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See <em>Champagne </em>v. <em>Raybestos-Manhattan, Inc., </em>212 Conn. 509, 562, 562 A.2d 1100 (1989). These same protections are included in \u00a7 47a-46.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">Our common law cases have similarly rejected the premise that the risk of stigmatization of the defendant automatically requires a higher standard of proof to be imposed upon the plaintiff. In a case in which a custody order was based upon a finding that a parent had sexually abused his child; <em>Mallory </em>v. <em>Mallory, </em>207 Conn. 48, 51-54, 539 A.2d 995 (1988); we acknowledged the \u201csubstantial social stigma\u201d that ensues upon such a finding, but concluded nonetheless \u201cthat a preponderance of the evidence standard adequately protects a parent from false accusations of sexual abuse, and that the ordinary civil standard of proof better serves the strong societal interest in protecting children from abusive parents.\u201d Id., 52. The stigma imposed on the parent in that case is, of course, considerably greater <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>than that imposed on the defendants here. Moreover, defendants who are found liable suffer stigma with respect to many kinds of torts in which damages are not augmented by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">No higher standard of proof is required when a plaintiff seeks to prove criminal activity in a civil action; see <em>Kilduffv. Adams, Inc., </em>219 Conn. 314, 327-29 n.14, 593 A.2d 478 (1991); <em>Verrastro </em>v. <em>Middlesex Ins. Co., </em>207 Conn. 179, 181-83, 540 A.2d 693 (1988); or, as the defendants conceded at oral argument, in a common law claim for punitive damages, in which a plaintiff must allege and prove that a defendant\u2019s misconduct was wanton or wilfully malicious. See <em>Markey </em>v. <em>Santangelo, </em>supra, 77. The contrary rule for libel actions involving a public figure; <em>Dacey </em>v. <em>Connecticut Bar Assn., </em>170 Conn. 520, 535-38, 368 A.2d 125 (1976); rests primarily on the constitutional right to freedom of speech, rather than on the need for an enhanced standard of proof because of a perceived need for greater certainty in adjudication. Id., 536.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">We disagree, therefore, with the Appellate Court\u2019s conclusion in this case, and in its earlier case of <em>Schaffer </em>v. <em>Lindy, </em>8 Conn. App. 96, 104-105, 511 A.2d 1022 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>(1986), that clear and convincing proof is an appropriate standard of proof whenever claims of tortious conduct have serious consequences or harsh or far-reaching effects on individuals or require the proof of willful, wrongful and unlawful acts. Absent evidence of legislative intent to the contrary, we continue to presume that when a statutory private right of action includes multiple damages, the plaintiffs burden of proof is the same as that in other tort cases. See <em>Munson </em>v. <em>Atwood, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">\u201cIn instances when punitive damages appear most appropriate, the amount of power held by the defendant (and commensurate vulnerability of the plaintiff) often is great and its abuse, for one reason or other, extreme.\u201d D. Owen, \u201cCivil Punishment and the Public Good,\u201d 56 S. Cal. L. Rev. 103, 104 (1982). Section 47a-46 was evidently drafted in order to ameliorate the disparity of power between landlords and tenants, and to deter landlords\u2019 abuse of their power. The legislature appears to have understood that the damages of the victim would often be intangible and difficult to assess, and that the monetary loss involved might be too small to merit a lawsuit if it were not augmented by statute. Thus, in assessing the plaintiff\u2019s loss in this case, the trial court observed that \u201cmany of the personal mementos\u2014photos, etc.\u2014could not be replaced and the court could not evaluate them.\u201d Yet unless <em>all </em>the victims of this type of misconduct are encouraged to act as private attorneys general, wrongful conduct will not be prevented, creating greater insecurity for all tenants. \u201cIn the calculation of his expected profits, the wrongdoer is likely to allow for a certain amount of money which will have to be returned to those victims who object too vigorously, and he will be perfectly content to bear the additional cost of litigation as the price for continuing his illicit business. It stands to reason that the chances of deterring him are materially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>increased by subjecting him to the payment of punitive damages.\u201d <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Sheldon, </em>10 N.Y.2d 401, 406, 179 N.E.2d 497, 223 N.Y.S.2d 488 (1961). To increase the plaintiffs burden of proof would weaken this incentive to litigate. \u201cA statute is not to be interpreted to thwart its purpose.\u201d <em>Mystic Marinelife Aquarium, Inc. </em>v. <em>Gill, </em>175 Conn. 483, 489, 400 A.2d 726 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">Section 47a-46 requires the trial court to make an independent determination that, taking into account all of the circumstances of the case, an award of double damages is appropriate. In exercising its discretionary authority, the trial court must examine critically any weakness in the plaintiff\u2019s case. \u201c Tn so far as [the statute] requires the person at fault to pay to the injured party a greater sum than that which measures the injury sustained, though not strictly penal, it so far partakes of the nature of a penal statute that it should be construed with reasonable strictness in determining whether the act complained of comes within the description in the statute of the acts for which the person in fault is made liable.\u2019 <em>Dubreuil </em>v. <em>Waterman, </em>84 Conn. 47, 51, 78 A. 721 [1911].\u201d <em>Dunbar </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>87 Conn. 253, 256, 87 A. 787 (1913).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">The record in this case reveals no abuse of the trial court\u2019s exercise of its discretion. As the trial court found, the plaintiff proved that the defendants had unilaterally seized control of the premises by removing and destroying almost all of the plaintiff\u2019s personal property in her apartment without attempting to contact her or giving her any opportunity to remove the property herself. This is precisely the type of misconduct that \u00a7\u00a7 47a-43 and 47a-46 were intended to prevent. See <em>Berlingo </em>v. <em>Sterling Ocean House, Inc., </em>203 Conn. 103, 108, 523 A.2d 888 (1987); <em>Orentlicherman </em>v. <em>Matarese, </em>99 Conn. 122, 126, 121 A. 275 (1923). The trial court observed that even after Boise had been informed that the plaintiff was on her way to the apart<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>ment to collect her belongings, \u201cpersonal property and pictures were strewn all over the yard.\u201d This, the trial court observed, was \u201ca pretty cruel thing to do\u201d and \u201cwas close to getting punitive damages.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In these circumstances, the trial court\u2019s exercise of its discretion comported with the mandate of the statute. See <em>Gargano </em>v. <em>Heyman, </em>203 Conn. 616, 622, 525 A.2d 1343 (1987); <em>Gionfriddo </em>v. <em>Avis Rent A Car System, Inc., </em>192 Conn. 280, 296-97, 472 A.2d 306 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is reversed and the case is remanded to that court with direction to affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b697-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 47a-43 (a) provides in pertinent part: \u201cWhen any person ...
