J.</author>\n<p id=\"A9N\">The principal issue in this appeal is the scope of a secured lender\u2019s obligation to participate in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>workout arrangements relating to the disposition of secured collateral in the hands of the debtor. The plaintiff, Connecticut National Bank (bank) brought an action against the defendants, Judith C. Douglas, Jerald L. Nelson (Nelson), Sidney A. Staunton, Robert Zbell and Robert M. Paradis, as guarantors of the unpaid debt of Jefferson Pine, Inc. (Jefferson Pine). The trial court rendered judgments in favor of the bank, either by default or by stipulation, against all the defendants except Nelson. The bank\u2019s action against Nelson was tried to a jury. In that trial, the trial court directed a verdict for the bank against Nelson in the amount of $632,288.92 after Nelson rested his case at the close of the presentation of the bank\u2019s evidence. Nelson appealed to the Appellate Court from the judgment of the trial court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">The facts concerning the commercial arrangements between the parties are undisputed. On March 11,1987, the bank agreed to lend $550,000 to Jefferson Pine, which was in the business of manufacturing and selling consumer furniture. To memorialize and secure this loan, Jefferson Pine signed a loan and security agreement that gave the bank a security interest in Jefferson Pine\u2019s inventory, equipment and other collateral. Contemporaneously, Jefferson Pine executed two instruments with respect to the underlying debt payable to the bank, a term note in the principal amount of $300,000 and a demand grid note for a line of credit in the amount of $250,000. The bank continues to be the holder of these notes.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">As a part of the loan negotiations, Nelson and the other individual defendants agreed to assure the payment of Jefferson Pine\u2019s obligations to the bank. Each manifested his or her obligation as guarantor: by a guaranty contained in the security and loan agreement; by an endorsement on the face of the two promissory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>notes; and by a separate guaranty agreement. No question has been raised about the validity of the defendants\u2019 signatures or about their knowing assent to these three forms of guaranty. Each of the guarantors was involved in Jefferson Pine\u2019s business. Nelson was then its chief operating officer and its principal shareholder.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">Jefferson Pine encountered difficulties in meeting its financial obligations. On April 28,1988, in order to continue to operate its business and to pay off its debts, it submitted to the bank a proposal for a workout plan, which the bank rejected. The details of that plan have not, however, been presented to this court. Nelson\u2019s pleadings allege that the plan contemplated that, under certain unspecified conditions, the Phoenix Northeast Corporation might advance new funds to Jefferson Pine. On May 2, 1988, shortly after the bank\u2019s rejection of the plan, Jefferson Pine ceased doing business and eleven days thereafter it invoked the protection of the federal bankruptcy laws. It first filed a voluntary petition for protection from creditors under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. After another unsuccessful attempt at a workout plan, the bankruptcy filing was converted into a liquidation proceeding under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code and the assets of Jefferson Pine were sold. The bank received a partial payment and then initiated the present action to recover the remainder of the unpaid indebtedness from the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">The dispute between the parties on this appeal does not directly challenge the trial proceedings that led to the verdict in the bank\u2019s favor. Nelson maintains instead that he is entitled to a new trial because two of the trial court\u2019s procedural rulings improperly limited the scope of the issues that he was able to present at trial. He contends that the trial court incorrectly (1) granted the bank\u2019s motion to strike his first, sec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>ond and third special defenses, and (2) denied his request for leave to file an amended pleading. We are unpersuaded by either claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">The bank filed its motion to strike in response to Nelson\u2019s second revised and amended answer, special defenses, counterclaim and cross complaint. It asked the trial court to strike the first six of Nelson\u2019s special defenses,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> his counterclaim and the second count of his cross complaint. Granting the bank\u2019s motion in part, the trial court struck Nelson\u2019s first, second, third and sixth special defenses and counts four and five of his counterclaim.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Nelson contends that the trial court should not have struck its first, second and third special defenses.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>All three special defenses focused on the same factual allegations of misconduct. In each, Nelson alleged that the bank had unjustly impaired the inventory of Jefferson Pine by its refusal: (1) to implement Jefferson Pine\u2019s workout plans; (2) to authorize disposal of the inventory; and (3) to take possession of the inventory and thereafter to dispose of it in accordance with its statutory obligations under article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code. Nelson alleged that \u201cthe aforesaid actions of the [bank] concerning the disposition of Jefferson Pine Inc.\u2019s inventory\u201d caused the Phoenix Northeast Corporation not to advance any funds to Jefferson Pine and caused the value of the inventory to diminish substantially. As a result of this alleged misconduct, Nelson claimed that his guaranty had been rescinded, in the first special defense because the bank had failed to act in a commercially reasonable manner in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 42a-9-507 (1),* **<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> in the second special defense because the bank had impaired the value of the inventory in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 42a-3-606 (1) (b),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and in the third special defense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>because the bank had impaired the value of the inventory in violation of his common law rights as guarantor.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">In its ruling on the bank\u2019s motion to strike, the trial court recognized its obligation to take the facts to be those alleged in the special defenses and to construe the defenses in the manner most favorable to sustaining their legal sufficiency. <em>Warner </em>v. <em>Konover, </em>210 Conn. 150, 152, 553 A.2d 1138 (1989); <em>Michaud </em>v. <em>Wawruck, </em>209 Conn. 407, 408, 551 A.2d 738 (1988); <em>Amodio </em>v. <em>Cunningham, </em>182 Conn. 80, 82, 438 A.2d 6 (1980). Even viewed from this generous perspective, the special defenses are notable for what they do <em>not </em>allege. Nelson has not asserted that the bank impaired Jefferson Pine\u2019s own authority to sell its inventory in the ordinary course of its business; see General Statutes \u00a7 42a-9-307 and \u00a7 42a-9-306 (1) and (2).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Nelson has likewise not claimed that the loan and security agreement between the bank and Jefferson Pine imposed upon the bank any special responsibility for, or control over, the inventory held for sale by Jefferson Pine. Finally, Nelson has not alleged that the negotiations with the Phoenix Northeast Corporation contemplated a subordinated indebtedness within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>exclusion of section 5.2 of the loan and security agreement.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Nelson\u2019s allegations come down to the proposition that the bank had wrongfully failed to renegotiate in good faith the restrictions in the loan and security agreement that limited the bank\u2019s obligations to continue to fund Jefferson Pine\u2019s operations and that imposed constraints on Jefferson Pine\u2019s use of its cash, accounts and inventory.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">The linchpin of Nelson\u2019s argument to sustain his first special defense is that the bank constructively took possession of Jefferson Pine\u2019s inventory when it failed to agree to the conditions of the plan that would have given Jefferson Pine access to new funding from the Phoenix Northeast Corporation. This contention has two flaws, one procedural and one substantive.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">As a procedural matter, the factual allegations on which Nelson relies expressly complain of the bank\u2019s refusal \u201cto take possession.\u201d As the bank has noted, it is inconsistent simultaneously to charge the bank with having refused to take possession and with having <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>taken constructive possession. <em>Hoard </em>v. <em>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>122 Conn. 185, 191-92, 188 A. 269 (1936); 1 E. Stephenson, Connecticut Civil Procedure (1970) \u00a7 128 (c), pp. 528-30. After the motion to strike had been granted, Nelson would have been free to amend his pleadings to substitute an allegation of constructive possession, but he did not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">As a substantive matter, the bank\u2019s alleged failure to agree to a workout plan does not, without more, constitute the taking of constructive possession of Jefferson Pine\u2019s inventory.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Nelson\u2019s claim must be measured against a definition of what constitutes constructive possession. Under our penal code, we have held that a person is in constructive possession who knowingly has the power and the intent to exercise dominion or control over personal property. \u201cThe essence of exercising control is not the manifestation of an act of control but instead it is the act of *being in a position of control coupled with the requisite mental intent. In our criminal statutes involving possession, this control must be exercised intentionally and with knowledge of the character of the controlled object.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>201 Conn. 505, 516, 523 A.2d 1252 (1986); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Somerville, </em>214 Conn. 378, 390, 572 A.2d 944 (1990); <em>State </em>v. <em>Reddick, </em>207 Conn. 323, 328, 541 A.2d 1209 (1988); <em>State </em>v. <em>Alfonso, </em>195 Conn. 624, 633, 490 A.2d 75 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Ober, </em>24 Conn. App. 347, 351, 588 A.2d 1080, cert. denied, 219 Conn. 909, 593 A.2d 134-35 (1991). In the civil context, we have held that a landlord\u2019s conduct may constitute the constructive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>eviction of a tenant if the landlord, \u201cwhile not actually depriving the tenant of possession of any part of the premises leased, has done or suffered some act by which the premises are rendered untenantable, and has thereby caused a failure of consideration for the tenant\u2019s promise to pay rent.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Amsterdam Realty Co. </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>115 Conn. 243, 248, 161 A. 339 (1932); <em>Conference Center Ltd. </em>v. <em>TRC, </em>189 Conn. 212, 220-21, 455 A.2d 587 (1983). Consistently with these holdings, Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (5th Ed. 1979), in defining \u201cpossession,\u201d posits that \u201c[a] person who, although not in actual possession, knowingly has both the power and the intention at a given time to exercise dominion or control over a thing . . . is then in constructive possession of it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">We therefore conclude that, in order to state a cause of action charging the bank with constructive possession, Nelson would have had to allege, as a minimum, that the bank had the power and the manifested intent to displace Jefferson Pine\u2019s control over its inventory or somehow to render that inventory commercially unmarketable. Nelson\u2019s allegations, with their focus on the bank\u2019s purported misconduct in refusing to renegotiate the terms of the security agreement with Jefferson Pine, do not state such a cause of action. On the facts alleged, the trial court therefore correctly determined, as a matter of law, that the bank was not in constructive possession of Jefferson Pine\u2019s inventory before its bankruptcy.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">In the absence of either actual or constructive possession by the bank, Nelson cannot prevail on his claim that the bank violated his rights under part 5 of article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code. While article 9 permits a secured party, upon default, to take possession of the secured collateral, it does not compel such a course of action. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 42a-9-501, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>42a-9-503, 42a-9-504, 42a-9-505;<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Connecticut Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Incendy, </em>207 Conn. 15, 21, 540 A.2d 32 (1988); 2 G. Gilmore, Security Interests in Personal Property (1965) \u00a7\u00a7 43.6, 44.1; 2 J. White &amp; R. Summers, Uniform Commercial Code (3d Ed. 1988) \u00a7 27-4. Section 42a-9-507 makes a secured party liable for losses caused by a faulty disposition of secured collateral only if \u201cthe secured party is not proceeding in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>accordance with the provisions of this part.\u201d Article 9 imposes no duties on a nonpossessory secured lender with regard to the disposition of the secured collateral.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">Our conclusion that the bank, on the facts alleged, had no duty to take any action with respect to Jefferson Pine\u2019s inventory before its bankruptcy necessarily means that the bank had no such duty after its bankruptcy. As Professors White and Summers point out, the secured debtor\u2019s bankruptcy may impair, but does not enlarge, the secured lender\u2019s access to the secured collateral. 2 J. White &amp; R. Summers, supra, \u00a7 25-12, pp. 471-72. We are unpersuaded that the bank\u2019s alleged refusal to allow inventory to be sold free and clear of its security interest is tantamount to the bank\u2019s taking constructive possession of the inventory. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>If Nelson\u2019s argument were sustained, Jefferson Pine\u2019s bankruptcy would require the bank to choose between two losing propositions: relinquishing its lien on the inventory or proceeds of inventory in the possession of an insolvent debtor, or assuming accountability for the declining value of an insolvent debtor\u2019s inventory. Nelson has cited no authority for imposing such a draconian choice on the bank in this case. The Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978, 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 363 (1979 &amp; Sup. 1991), does not mandate such a result, and we decline to mandate it as a matter of state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">Because the bank had neither actual nor constructive possession of Jefferson Pine\u2019s inventory, either before or after its bankruptcy, we conclude that Nelson has not alleged a breach of any duty by the bank in its refusal to agree to Jefferson Pine\u2019s plan for refinancing. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court correctly struck Nelson\u2019s first special defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">Nelson\u2019s second and third special defenses alleged that the bank\u2019s conduct had impaired the secured collateral in such a way as to discharge him as guarantor, either under article 3 of the Uniform Commercial Code, General Statutes \u00a7 42a-3-606 (1) (b), or under the common law rules governing the relationship between creditors and guarantors. See 1 J. White &amp; R. Summers, supra, \u00a7 13-15. The trial court concluded that these defenses were untenable as a matter of law for three independent reasons: (1) Nelson could not invoke \u00a7 42a-3-606 because that section only applied to negotiable instruments and the variable interest rate provision in the notes violated the requirement of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 42a-3-104 and 42a-3-106<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> that a negotia<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>ble instrument must contain an unconditional promise or order to pay <em>\u201ca </em>sum certain\u201d; (2) even if \u00a7 42a-3-606 principles were applicable, or if Nelson could rely on parallel common law principles under which a guarantor is discharged by a creditor\u2019s impairment of collateral, Nelson\u2019s pleading was insufficient because it did not allege that the bank had engaged in some affirmative act that impaired the value of the collateral; and (3) Nelson was barred from asserting any claims arising out of impairment of the value of the collateral because he had expressly waived such a right in the guaranties he had signed. We agree that Nelson\u2019s express waiver bars his second and third defenses, and therefore do not need to consider the other grounds upon which the trial court ruled against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">The documents that memorialize Nelson\u2019s guaranty of Jefferson Pine\u2019s indebtedness demonstrate, on their face, that Nelson expressly waived any right he might otherwise have had to complain of the impairment of his right to be subrogated to the bank\u2019s interest in the secured collateral in the possession of Jefferson Pine. Each of these documents contains an express waiver of the right to assert any claim with regard to any action the bank might take, or not take, with regard to Jefferson Pine\u2019s collateral. Nelson signed the loan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>and security agreement as guarantor and thereby agreed that \u201c[t]he bank shall have no duty as to the collection or protection of the Collateral or any income thereon.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> As a guarantor of the term note and the demand grid note, Nelson agreed that \u201c[u]nless and until all liabilities of the Borrower evidenced by said note have been paid in full, the undersigned hereby individually and collectively waive any and all rights of subrogation, reimbursement or indemnity which may now or hereafter accrue to the undersigned and any and all rights of recourse to or with respect to any assets or property of the Borrower or to any collateral for said liabilities.\u201d As a party to an individual guaranty to the bank, Nelson again agreed, in a boldface provision on the face of the guaranty, that his liability to the bank would \u201cnot be terminated by, and the undersigned assents to . . . any modification, waiver or amendment of the terms of any agreement relating to liabilities, any substitution, exchange or release of collateral.\u201d He therein acknowledged, furthermore, that the bank had \u201cno duty to collect or protect any collateral or any income thereon, nor to preserve any rights against any other parties, and [that the bank could] proceed under this guarantee immediately upon borrower\u2019s default without resorting to or regard to any collateral or any other guarantee or source of payment.\u201d In these three different forms of guaranty, simultaneously executed for the benefit of the bank in order to induce it to extend credit to Jefferson Pine, Nelson manifested, definitively and unequivocally, his intent to waive any rights that he might have had as guarantor to challenge the bank\u2019s conduct with regard to the secured collateral.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>Both the common law and the Uniform Commercial Code recognize that a guarantor may expressly waive his rights with respect to collateral that secures the debt that he has guaranteed. <em>Glazier </em>v. <em>Douglass, </em>32 Conn. 393, 399 (1865); General Statutes \u00a7 42a-3-606 (1) (b); L. Simpson, Handbook on the Law of Suretyship (1950) \u00a7 72; 1 J. White &amp; R. Summers, supra, \u00a7 13-17. Nelson has not alleged that he did not sign these documents or that he was uninformed about their contents. While a determination about a party\u2019s intent to waive his rights ordinarily poses a question of fact, clear and definitive contract language can establish waiver as a matter of law. <em>Pero Building Co. </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>6 Conn. App. 180, 184, 504 A.2d 524 (1986); see also <em>Thompson &amp; Peck, Inc. </em>v. <em>Harbor Marine Contracting Corporation, </em>203 Conn. 123, 130-31, 523 A.2d 1266 (1987); <em>Sturman </em>v. <em>Socha, </em>191 Conn. 1, 10, 463 A.2d 527 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">Although this court has not had the occasion to consider the extent to which a guarantor may expressly waive claims relating to a secured creditor\u2019s alleged impairment of collateral, cases in other states uniformly recognize the enforceability of such a waiver if the language of guaranty is sufficiently specific. See, e.g., <em>Salter </em>v. <em>AmSouth Bank, N.A., </em>487 So. 2d 927, 929-30 (Ala. Civ. App. 1985); <em>First National Bank of Arizona </em>v. <em>Bennett Venture, Ltd., </em>130 Ariz. 562, 565-66, 637 P.2d 1065 (Ariz. App. 1981); <em>American Security Bank </em>v. <em>Clarno, </em>151 Cal. App. 3d 874, 882-84, 199 Cal. Rptr. 127 (1984); <em>Sadler </em>v. <em>Trust Co. Bank of South Georgia, N.A., </em>178 Ga.

Corporation </em>v. <em>Northeast Texas Development Co., </em>635 S.W.2d 897, 899 (Tex. App. 1982); <em>Continental Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Utah Security Mortgage, Inc., </em>701 P.2d 1095, 1098-99 (Utah 1985); <em>Schauss </em>v. <em>Garner, </em>590 P.2d 1316, 1319-20 (Wyo. 1979). The cases to the contrary on which Nelson relies are distinguishable because the guaranties therein at issue contained no specific waivers of rights with regard to collateral. <em>Langeveld </em>v. <em>L.R.Z.H. Corporation, </em>74 N.J. 45, 52-54, 376 A.2d 931 (1977); <em>Valley Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Rite Way Concrete Forming, Inc., </em>742 P.2d 105, 110 (Utah App. 1987). Given the specificity and breadth of the language contained in the guaranties to which Nelson subscribed, we conclude that his waiver of rights bars enforceability of any claims a guarantor might otherwise have for impairment of secured collateral.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">Although we recognize that General Statutes \u00a7 42a-9-501 (3)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> has a special antiwaiver provision concerning the disposition and redemption of secured collateral, and an accounting for its proceeds; see, e.g., <em>Wisconics Engineering, Inc. </em>v. <em>Fisher, </em>466 N.E.2d 745, 762-64, 766-67 (Ind. App. 1984); <em>Dakota Bank &amp; Trust </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number><em>Co., Fargo </em>v. <em>Grinde, </em>422 N.W.2d 813, 816-18 (N.D. 1988); that provision does not govern this case. By its own terms, \u00a7 42a-9-501 (3) concerns only disputes about the commercial reasonableness of the conduct of a secured creditor in possession of secured collateral. Our determination, earlier in this opinion, that the bank had neither actual nor constructive possession of Jefferson Pine\u2019s inventory forecloses the applicability of \u00a7 42a-9-501 (3). Numerous cases in other jurisdictions have held that a secured creditor has no duty to repossess when a guarantor has waived rights concerning impairment of collateral. See, e.g., <em>Salter </em>v. <em>AmSouth Bank, N.A., </em>supra; <em>First National Bank of Arizona </em>v. <em>Bennett Venture, Ltd., </em>supra; <em>Kansas State Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>DeLorean, </em>supra; <em>Price </em>v. <em>First National Bank of the South, </em>supra; <em>Lemay Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Lawrence, </em>supra; <em>American Bank of Commerce </em>v. <em>Covolo, </em>supra, 408; <em>Continental Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Utah Security Mortgage, Inc., </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">We conclude, therefore, that Nelson cannot prevail on his second and third special defenses because the guaranties that he signed expressly waived his right to assert any claims about the bank\u2019s alleged misconduct with respect to its security interest in Jefferson Pine\u2019s inventory. The trial court, accordingly, correctly granted the bank\u2019s motion to strike these defenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">Nelson asked the court for permission to file a third revised and amended answer, special defenses, counter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>claim and cross complaint on June 27,1991. The chronology of the case to that date had included: the filing of the bank\u2019s complaint on June 21,1988; the filing of Nelson\u2019s first answer, special defenses, setoffs and cross complaint on September 28, 1988; the filing of Nelson\u2019s second revised and amended answer, special defenses, counterclaim and cross complaint on November 30, 1989; and the partial granting of the bank\u2019s motion to strike on April 20,1990. The bank\u2019s motion for summary judgment, filed December 24,1990, had been denied on June 6, 1991. The case had been set down for a jury trial to begin on July 9, 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">In its review of Nelson\u2019s request for leave to amend, the trial court found that the amended pleading would have added lengthy new allegations of fact and law. While Nelson\u2019s earlier pleading had challenged the bank\u2019s refusal to approve a specific business plan, proposed by Jefferson Pine on April 28,1988, that sought to facilitate future advances from the Phoenix Northeast Corporation, the amended pleading added allegations about the bank\u2019s refusal to approve a different plan, with a different company, on a different date. The court weighed the bank\u2019s objection that it would be prejudiced if a trial proceeded as scheduled without affording the bank an opportunity to explore the implications of Nelson\u2019s expanded new pleadings. Despite Nelson\u2019s contention that his factual contentions had been raised in his memorandum of law objecting to the bank\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the court denied the request to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">Our review of a trial court\u2019s denial of a belated request for amendment of the pleadings is limited to an inquiry into whether the trial court abused its discretion. \u201cWe have not previously found an abuse of discretion when a trial court, on the eve of trial, concluded that prejudice and delay would result from a substantial amendment to the [pleadings], and we decline to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>do so in the present circumstances. <em>Beckman </em>v. <em>Jalich Homes, Inc., </em>190 Conn. 299, 302-303, 460 A.2d 488 (1983); <em>Lawson </em>v. <em>Godfried, </em>181 Conn. 214, 216, 435 A.2d 15 (1980).\u201d <em>Multi-Service Contractors, Inc. </em>v. <em>Vernon, </em>193 Conn. 446, 453-54, 477 A.2d 653 (1984); see also <em>Daily </em>v. <em>New Britain Machine Co., </em>200 Conn. 562, 573-74, 512 A.2d 893 (1986). The trial court could reasonably have concluded that the bank had a right, in preparing its case for trial, to rely on the factual allegations contained in Nelson\u2019s pleadings rather than on the factual allegations contained in a memorandum of law. The court could equally have concluded that Nelson had had ample time to amend his pleadings after the granting of the motion to strike. The fact that the bank had thereafter filed a motion for summary judgment did not impair Nelson\u2019s ability to file a request, in timely fashion, for a further amendment to his pleadings. See Practice Book \u00a7 176.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b556-7\"> Nelson\u2019s seventh special defense, to which the bank did not object, asked the bank to reduce its claim by the amount that it had recovered in the liquidation of the assets of the corporate debtor.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b556-8\"> The trial court left standing, for subsequent trial to the jury, two sets of contentions that were raised by Nelson\u2019s special defenses and counterclaim. The court permitted Nelson to go forward with his contention, in his fourth and fifth special defenses and in counts two and three of his counterclaim, that the bank\u2019s refusal to cooperate with the corporate defendant\u2019s plan for a workout constituted a breach of the bank\u2019s implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 42a-l-203,42a-l-106; 2 Restatement (Second), Contracts \u00a7 205 (1979). The trial court also saved for trial the first count of Nelson\u2019s counterclaim, which alleged that the bank\u2019s conduct constituted an unfair or deceptive trade practice under the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act, General Statutes \u00a7 42-110 (b). Nelson has not pursued on appeal any challenge to the adverse verdict on these claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b556-9\"> The merits of the trial court\u2019s ruling on the bank\u2019s motion to strike are properly before us because, on May 2,1990, within the time period specified by Practice Book \u00a7 4002 (a), Nelson filed a notice of appeal and reservation of appeal with respect thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-10\">Nelson has not pursued on appeal the merits of his sixth special defense that the bank\u2019s conduct constituted an unfair or deceptive act or practice in the conduct of any trade or commerce in violation of the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act, General Statutes \u00a7 42-110b. A similar claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>was resolved through the adverse verdict on the first count of Nelson\u2019s counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">Nelson withdrew his cross complaint against the defendants Zbell and Paradis on July 26, 1991.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b557-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 42a-9-507 (1) provides: \u201cIf it is established that the secured party is not proceeding in accordance with the provisions of this part disposition may be ordered or restrained on appropriate terms and conditions.

See General Statutes \u00a7 42a-9-306 (2) and section 1.9 of the loan and security agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b560-6\"> In his reply brief, Nelson suggests for the first time that \u201c[m]uch of the inventory was machinery.\u201d Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code, on which Nelson relies for this claim, makes a sharp distinction between inventory and equipment. See General Statutes \u00a7 42a-9-109. For Jefferson Pine, which was engaged in the business of selling furniture, its machinery was equipment and not inventory. A defense charging the bank with misconduct with respect to inventory therefore does not encompass a claim with respect to machinery.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b562-5\"> General Statutes \u00a7 42a-9-501 provides in relevant part: \u201cdefault; procedure WHEN SECURITY AGREEMENT COVERS BOTH REAL AND PERSONAL PROPERTY. (1) When a debtor is in default under a security agreement, a secured party has the rights and remedies provided in this part and except as limited by subsection (3) those provided in the security agreement. He may reduce his claim to judgment, foreclose or otherwise enforce the security interest by any available judicial procedure. If the collateral is documents the secured party may proceed either as to the documents or as to the goods covered thereby. A secured party in possession has the rights, remedies and duties provided in section 42a-9-207. The rights and remedies referred to in this subsection are cumulative. . . . (5) When a secured party has reduced his claim to judgment the lien of any levy which may be made upon his collateral by virtue of any execution based upon the judgment shall relate back to the date of the perfection of the security interest in such collateral. A judicial sale, pursuant to such execution, is a foreclosure of the security interest by judicial procedure within the meaning of this section, and the secured party may purchase at the sale and thereafter hold the collateral free of any other requirements of this article.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">General Statutes \u00a7 42a-9-503 provides: \u201csecured party\u2019s right to take possession after default. Unless otherwise agreed a secured party has on default the right to take possession of the collateral. In taking possession a secured party may proceed without judicial process if this can be done without breach of the peace or may proceed by action. If the security agreement so provides the secured party may require the debtor to assemble the collateral and make it available to the secured party at a place to be designated by the secured party which is reasonably convenient to both parties. Without removal a secured party may render equipment unusable, and may dispose of collateral on the debtor\u2019s premises under section 42a-9-504.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">General Statutes \u00a7 42a-9-504 provides in relevant part: \u201csecured party\u2019s RIGHT TO DISPOSE OF COLLATERAL AFTER DEFAULT; EFFECT OF DISPOSITION. (1) A secured party after default may sell, lease or otherwise dispose of any or all of the collateral in its then condition or following any commercially reasonable preparation or processing. . . . (3) Disposition of the collateral may be by public or private proceedings and may be made by way of one or more contracts. Sale or other disposition may be as a unit or in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>parcels and at any time and place and on any terms but every aspect of the disposition including the method, manner, time, place and terms must be commercially reasonable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">General Statutes \u00a7 42a-9-505 provides: \u201ccompulsory disposition of COLLATERAL; ACCEPTANCE OF THE COLLATERAL AS DISCHARGE OF OBLIGATION. (1) If the debtor has paid sixty per cent of the cash price in the case of a purchase money security interest in consumer goods or sixty per cent of the loan in the case of another security interest in consumer goods, and has not signed after default a statement renouncing or modifying his rights under this part a secured party who has taken possession of collateral must dispose of it under section 42a-9-504 and if he fails to do so within ninety days after he takes possession the debtor at his option may recover in conversion or under section 42a-9-507 (1) on secured party\u2019s liability. (2) In any other case involving consumer goods or any other collateral a secured party in possession may, after default, propose to retain the collateral in satisfaction of the obligation. Written notice of such proposal shall be sent to the debtor if he has not signed after default a statement renouncing or modifying his rights under this subsection. In the case of consumer goods no other notice need be given. In other cases notice shall be sent to any other secured party from whom the secured party has received, before sending his notice to the debtor or before the debtor\u2019s renunciation of his rights, written notice of a claim of an interest in the collateral. If the secured party receives objection in writing from a person entitled to receive notification within twenty-one days after the notice was sent, the secured party must dispose of the collateral under section 42a-9-504.
