The juvenile respondent, Keijam T., appeals<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> from the order of the Superior Court for juvenile matters transferring him to the regular criminal docket, based upon a finding of probable cause to believe that he committed murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> as alleged in a delinquency-petition filed against him. The respondent claims that the court: (1) applied an improper standard to evaluate the state\u2019s evidence produced in the transfer hearing; (2) improperly concluded that, under the facts of this case, there could be two inconsistent findings of probable cause regarding the respondent and another purported assailant; (3) improperly precluded him from introducing evidence to rebut the court\u2019s finding of probable cause, in accordance with his offer of proof; and (4) found probable cause based on insufficient evidence. We reverse, and order a new transfer hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">The state filed a delinquency petition in the Superior Court against the respondent, who was then fifteen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>years of age,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> claiming that he committed the serious juvenile offense of murder, in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a, by intentionally causing the death of another person on August 13,1990.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thereafter, the state moved to transfer the respondent to the regular criminal docket pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-127.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 6After a hearing, the court granted the motion, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">The court made the following written findings pursuant to \u00a7 46b-127. At approximately 12:30 a.m., on August 13,1990, on Arthur Street in New Haven, the victim, Tythron Blue, was fatally shot by a medium caliber bullet that entered his right side. The trajectory of the bullet was from right to left, and was horizontal. The weapon was not recovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">The court also found that approximately one week before the shooting, the respondent\u2019s mother had complained about her car being \u201cshot up.\u201d The court further found that about two hours before the shooting, she had accused Blue of having done this, and the respondent had advised his mother not to worry, that Blue would \u201cget his.\u201d In addition, on the evening of the shooting, the respondent had fired a weapon in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>Arthur Street neighborhood, and had warned people in the area not to go outside.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">The court further found that, on the night in question, Blue and Moses James were walking down Arthur Street together when they heard shots fired. James turned and saw the respondent on the same side of Arthur Street, behind him and Blue. The respondent was carrying an \u201cUzi type\u201d weapon. James also saw Rodney Lewis on the opposite side of Arthur Street, approximately five or six houses in front of him and Blue. Lewis was carrying a black hand gun. James ran for an alley to his right a few houses up on Arthur Street and, after a moment\u2019s hesitation, Blue also ran into the alley. As Blue did so, he turned his right side toward the respondent, who was still behind the fleeing twosome. In the alley, Blue stopped and told James that he had been shot. James resumed running, and when he returned shortly thereafter to Arthur Street, Blue was bleeding and dying in the middle of the street.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">The court further found that James, an eyewitness to the incident, testified that only the respondent, and not Lewis, could have fired the fatal shot into Blue\u2019s right side. The court also stated that, \u201c[i]n any event assuming only two shooters, probable cause need not be exclusive.\u201d Moreover, the court found that, although there had been a history of antagonism between the families of the respondent and James, and James had a felony conviction, James \u201cwas a credible witness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">On the basis of these findings, the court found probable cause to believe that the respondent intended to cause and did cause the death of Blue. Accordingly, the court transferred the respondent to the regular criminal docket.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b135-9\">We turn first to the respondent\u2019s fourth claim, namely, that, irrespective of the first three claims, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>evidence was insufficient to support the court\u2019s finding of probable cause. We address this claim first because, if meritorious, it would result in a direction to the trial court to deny the state\u2019s transfer motion rather than a new transfer hearing, and, therefore, it would render consideration of the respondent\u2019s first three claims unnecessary. The respondent argues that: (1) the state\u2019s evidence was insufficient to establish probable cause because it was equally probable that Lewis, rather than the respondent, fired the fatal shot; and (2) the evidence was insufficient to establish probable cause regarding the respondent\u2019s mental state. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">General Statutes \u00a7 46b-127<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> requires, as a precondition to transfer from the docket for juvenile matters <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>to the regular criminal docket, that the court find \u201cthat there is probable cause to believe that the child has committed the act for which he is charged,\u201d in this case, intentional murder. The standard for establishing probable cause is well established.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">\u201cThe quantum of evidence necessary to establish probable cause at a preliminary hearing is less than the quantum necessary to establish proof beyond a reasonable doubt at trial. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Green, </em>237 Kan. 146, 148, 697 P.2d 1305 (1985); <em>Myers </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>363 Mass. 843, 850, 298 N.E.2d 819 (1973); <em>State </em>v. <em>Dunn, </em>121 Wis. 2d 389, 396, 359 N.W.2d 151 (1984). In making its finding, the court had to determine whether the government\u2019s evidence would warrant a person of reasonable caution to believe that the accused [had] committed the crime. Arenella, \u2018Reforming the Federal Grand Jury and the State Preliminary Hearing to Prevent Conviction Without Adjudication,\u2019 78 Mich. L. Rev. 463, 478 (1980); <em>Brinegar </em>v. <em>United States, </em>338 U.S. 160, 175-76, 69 S. Ct. 1302, 93 L. Ed. 1879 (1949). <em>State </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>[200 Conn. 323, 336, 512 A.2d 140 (1986)]. The quantum of evidence necessary to establish probable cause exceeds mere suspicion, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>is substantially less than that required for conviction. Our cases have made clear that [t]here is often a fine line between mere suspicion and probable cause, and [t]hat line necessarily must be drawn by an act of judgment formed in light of the particular situation and with account taken of all the circumstances. <em>Brinegar </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 176. <em>State </em>v. <em>Penland, </em>174 Conn. 153,155-56, 384 A.2d 356, cert. denied, 436 U.S. 906, 98 S. Ct. 2237, 56 L. Ed. 2d 404 (1978). <em>State </em>v. <em>Dennis, </em>189 Conn. 429, 431-32, 456 A.2d 333 (1983); <em>State </em>v. <em>Acquin, </em>187 Conn. 647, 657, 448 A.2d 163 (1982), cert. denied, 463 U.S. 1229, 103 S.

Ed. 2d 1411 (1983).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>213 Conn. 708, 720-21, 570 A.2d 174 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">When reviewing a trial court\u2019s finding of probable cause made for purposes of a transfer pursuant to \u00a7 46b-127, \u201cit is the function of this court to determine whether the decision of the trial court is clearly erroneous. See Practice Book [\u00a7 4060]. . . . [W]here the factual basis of the court\u2019s decision is challenged we must determine whether the facts set out in the . . . decision are supported by the evidence or whether, in light of the evidence and the pleadings in the whole record, those facts are clearly erroneous. <em>Pandolphe\u2019s Auto Parts, Inc. </em>v. <em>Manchester, </em>181 Conn. 217, 221-22, 435 A.2d 24 (1980).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>In re Ralph M., </em>211 Conn. 289, 316, 559 A.2d 179 (1989). As in any case involving the challenge to a factual finding, we view the evidence and the permissible inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to sustaining the trial court\u2019s determination of probable cause. <em>Bridgeport Restoration Co. </em>v. <em>A. Petrucci Construction Co., </em>211 Conn. 230, 232, 557 A.2d 1263 (1989); <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Cohen, </em>182 Conn. 193, 202, 438 A.2d 55 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">James testified that the respondent was behind him and Blue, on the same side of the street, and that Lewis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>was in front of them, on the other side of the street. He testified that, as he and Blue were walking down Arthur Street, they heard a \u201cthump,\u201d that they both turned around but saw nothing, and that they continued walking, with Blue behind James. James also testified that when he heard the shooting, he turned around again and saw the respondent behind them, shooting at them with an \u201cUzi type\u201d weapon. He also testified that he and Blue then ran into an alley that was located on the same side of the street, and that as they \u201cgot in the alley\u201d Blue was holding his side and saying, \u201cMo, I\u2019m shot, Mo, I\u2019m shot.\u201d Reviewing this evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the finding of probable cause, we conclude that the court was entitled to infer that Blue turned to the right in order to enter the alley, exposing his right side to the respondent, and that as he did so, the respondent shot him in the right side.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">It is true that James also testified that, before he and Blue ran into the alley, he saw Lewis across the street and in front of them, approximately five or six houses away from them. Lewis was shooting at them with a handgun while running backwards. It is also true, moreover, that James did not see Blue turn to the right into the alley, and that there was no ballistic evidence before the couid that would have tied the bullet retrieved from Blue\u2019s body to an \u201cUzi type\u201d weapon rather than to a handgun.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">The respondent argues that, since James testified that both he and Blue turned around in response to a noise behind them, after which they both ran, it is equally inferable that Blue turned around to the left, exposing his right side to Lewis, who shot him as he did so. Therefore, the respondent contends, it is \u201cmere speculation\u201d that Blue was shot by the respondent when he turned to the right to go into the alley. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>The respondent mischaracterizes the pertinent parts of James\u2019 testimony. James did testify that, when they heard the \u201cthump,\u201d both he and Blue turned around, but that was before the shooting began. He testified that, after turning around and seeing nothing, they continued walking. He also testified that then, when \u201csomebody started shooting . . . /looked back,\u201d and saw the respondent shooting at them. (Emphasis added.) He did not testify that Blue also turned around in response to the noise of shooting. Thus, according to James\u2019 testimony, Blue\u2019s turn, on which the respondent rests his argument, was before and not during the shooting. Moreover, the court\u2019s finding that the respondent shot Blue in the right side was based upon the inference that the respondent did so as Blue turned right into the alley while fleeing, not that Blue was shot when he turned around in response to the noise of shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">Furthermore, we have held that, although proof beyond a reasonable doubt must preclude every reasonable hypothesis except that which supports the defendant\u2019s guilt; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>219 Conn. 596, 602, 594 A.2d 459 (1991); <em>State </em>v. <em>Morrill, </em>193 Conn. 602, 610, 478 A.2d 994 (1984); <em>State </em>v. <em>Foord, </em>142 Conn. 285, 294, 113 A.2d 591 (1955); in determining whether the state has met its burden of proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt the factfinder, in viewing evidence which could yield contrary inferences, is not precluded from drawing reasonable inferences consistent with guilt and is not required to draw those reasonable inferences consistent with innocence. <em>State </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>supra, 604. Certainly, the court has the same leeway in determining whether the state has met the much lower standard of establishing probable cause. Thus, the court was entitled to infer that Blue was shot as he turned to the right, rather than to the left.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>The respondent\u2019s argument that the evidence was insufficient to establish his intent to kill is equally flawed. It is axiomatic that a factfinder may infer an intent to kill \u201cfrom circumstantial evidence such as the type of weapon used, the manner in which it was used, the type of wound inflicted and the events leading to and immediately following the death.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>In re Edwin N., </em>215 Conn. 277, 284, 575 A.2d 1016 (1990). Here, there was evidence of the respondent\u2019s animus toward Blue and his threat that Blue would \u201cget his.\u201d There was also evidence that the respondent fired several shots at Blue with a deadly weapon from a short distance away. This evidence was sufficient to support a finding of probable cause that the respondent shot at Blue with the intent to kill him.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">We turn next to the respondent\u2019s first and third claims, which, as we view them, are closely related to each other. These claims are that the court applied an improper standard of evaluation to the state\u2019s evidence in arriving at its determination of probable cause, and that the court improperly precluded the respondent from introducing evidence that \u201cwould [have been] sufficient to rebut the finding of probable cause.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 54-46a (b). We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">These claims arise out of the following procedural context. In conducting the transfer hearing pursuant to \u00a7 46b-127, the court, as required by that statute, followed the procedures provided by \u00a7 54-46a.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> After the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>state had presented its evidence and the respondent had engaged in cross-examination of the state\u2019s witnesses, as was his right under \u00a7 54-46a, the court made an oral finding of probable cause to believe that the respondent committed the crime of murder by intentionally killing Blue. In making that finding, the court stated that it considered itself bound by our decision in <em>In re Edwin N., </em>supra, \u201cto look at the evidence presented by the prosecution in the light most favorable to the State . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The respondent objected to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>court\u2019s use of that standard of evaluation of the evidence, claiming that such a deferential standard, although appropriate for appellate review of a finding of probable cause, was not the appropriate standard for a trial court to use in determining probable cause after an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">Thereafter, the respondent made the following three part oral offer of proof pursuant to \u00a7 54-46a (b)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>: (1) at the time of the shooting, Rodney Lewis, who had been charged with attempted assault in connection with the incident, was not in front of James and Blue, as James had testified, but was behind them when James and Blue were walking down the street;<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> (2) within hours of the shooting, Lewis had admitted shooting Blue;* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and (3) a \u201cblood feud\u201d existed between James\u2019 family and the respondent\u2019s family, that included the use of the criminal justice system by James and his family <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>against the respondent and his family.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The court ruled that the respondent would not be permitted to introduce this evidence because the \u201cevidence would not be sufficient to rebut [the court\u2019s] finding of probable cause.\u201d In making this determination, the court stated that it viewed the offer of proof \u201cmost favorably to the State.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The respondent excepted to the court\u2019s ruling and specifically objected to \u201cthe ruling that you view the offer of proof in the light most favorable to the State.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">We first consider the court\u2019s finding of probable cause, based solely upon the state\u2019s evidence. The court believed that, in deciding whether the state had established probable cause, it was required to view the state\u2019s evidence in the light most favorable to the state. Presumably, this meant that any inferences were to be drawn and any questions of credibility of witnesses were to be resolved in favor of, rather than contrary to, a finding of probable cause. The court based this belief; see footnote 8, supra; on the following language in <em>In re Edwin N., </em>supra, 284: <em>\u201cViewing the proffered proof most favorably to the </em>state, the court must decide whether the state\u2019s evidence would warrant a person of reasonable caution to believe that the respondent had committed the crime with which he was charged.\u201d (Emphasis added.) We agree with the respondent that the trial court gave improper effect to the italicized language.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>First, that language was dictum in the case. The issue under consideration in that part of <em>In re Edwin N., </em>supra, was whether evidence was sufficient to support the trial court\u2019s implied finding of intent to commit murder, and not whether the standard applied by the trial court to the state\u2019s evidence was improper. Id., 283-84. Indeed, other language used by this court in that case underscored the trial court\u2019s role as a finder of facts based on its independent evaluation of the evidence produced in the transfer hearing. We noted, for example, that \u201cthe court could \u2018hear any evidence <em>that it determines to be reliable, </em>and that is material and relevant to the issue of probable cause.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 281, quoting <em>In re Ralph M., </em>supra, 307. We referred, also, to the need of the trial court \u201cto make the <em>evidentiary findings </em>that warrant depriving the juvenile of the protections to which he would otherwise be entitled.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>In re Edwin N., </em>supra, 282. Finally, in deciding that the trial court\u2019s implied finding of intent to kill was supported by the evidence, we stated: \u201cAlthough the respondent introduced other evidence suggesting that the shooting might have been accidental or unpremeditated, <em>the trial court was entitled to resolve the assessment of credibility of this testimony in favor of the state.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Id., 284.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">Second, as <em>In re Edwin N. </em>itself makes clear, the probable cause determination depends on factual findings. Id., 282. Central to the factfinding process is the process of drawing inferences, and central to the process of drawing inferences is the notion that the fact-finder is not required to draw only those inferences consistent with one view of the evidence, but may \u201c \u2018draw whatever inferences from the evidence or facts established by the evidence it deems to be reasonable and logical.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>supra, 604, quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Dumlao, </em>3 Conn. App. 607, 616-17, 491 A.2d 404 (1985). It would be inconsistent with that notion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>require the trial court, engaged in a transfer hearing pursuant to \u00a7 46b-127, to view the state\u2019s evidence in the light most favorable to the state, because to do so would deprive the trial court of the necessary option of drawing inferences from such evidence that it deems to be reasonable and logical and that are unfavorable to the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">Third, to limit the trial court to a favorable view of the state\u2019s evidence would be incompatible with the requirement of \u00a7 46b-127 that the transfer hearing be conducted according to the procedures of \u00a7 54-46a.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Those procedures include \u201cthe right [of the respondent] to . . . cross-examine witnesses against him . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 54-46a (b). The principal purpose of cross-examination; \u201cthe greatest legal engine ever invented for the discovery of truth\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) <em>State </em>v. <em>Brigandi, </em>186 Conn. 521, 533, 442 A.2d 927 (1982); is to enable the factfinder to assess the credibility of the witness, and thus the truth of his testimony. Id. If the trial court were required to view the state\u2019s evidence in its most favorable light, the respondent\u2019s right of cross-examination would be largely irrelevant. We decline to read \u00a7 46b-127 to require such an incongruous result.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">We do not conclude, of course, that the trial court in this case was required to view the state\u2019s evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>in its least favorable light, or that it was barred from drawing any reasonable and logical inferences from that evidence that were favorable to the state. We hold only that it was required to arrive at its determination of whether the state had established probable cause unfettered by the view that it must draw all inferences and resolve any questions of credibility favorably to the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">Thus, the trial court\u2019s role in determining probable cause in an evidentiary hearing pursuant to \u00a7 46b-127 is similar to its role in other factfinding proceedings: it must consider all the evidence before it, including any frailties therein disclosed by cross-examination; it must draw whatever inferences therefrom that it considers to be reasonable and logical; and it must decide whether that evidence, including those inferences, would warrant a person of reasonable caution to believe that the respondent committed the crime with which he is charged. The only difference between this proceeding and other factfinding proceedings is that the level of certainty required in this proceeding is considerably lower than in other proceedings. Proof of probable cause is not as demanding as proof by a fair preponderance of the evidence; <em>Ledgebrook Condominium Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Lusk Corporation, </em>172 Conn. 577, 584, 376 A.2d 60 (1977); <em>Newtown Associates </em>v. <em>Northeast Structures, Inc., </em>15 Conn. App. 633, 636, 546 A.2d 310 (1988); and is substantially less demanding than proof beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>supra, 720. Although \u201c[t]he quantum of evidence necessary to establish probable cause exceeds mere suspicion . . . [tjhere is often a fine line between mere suspicion and probable cause, and [tjhat line necessarily must be drawn by an act of judgment formed in light of the particular situation and with account taken of all the circumstances.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>It follows from this conclusion that the trial court also applied an improper standard to the respondent\u2019s offer of proof. If it is inconsistent with the provisions of \u00a7 54-46a to view the state\u2019s evidence most favorably to the state in determining whether the state has established probable cause, a fortiori it is inconsistent with those provisions to view the respondent\u2019s offer of proof, made in an attempt \u201cto rebut the finding of probable cause\u201d; General Statutes \u00a7 54-46a (b); most favorably to the state, as the court did in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">Under \u00a7 54-46a (b), if the court finds probable cause based on the state\u2019s evidence, \u201cthe accused person may make a specific offer of proof, including the names of witnesses who would testify or produce the evidence offered.\u201d The accused only gains the right to present that evidence if \u201cthe court determines that such evidence would be sufficient to rebut the finding of probable cause.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 54-46a (b). The purpose of this procedure is to protect the proceeding from evidence that, even if believed, would not undermine the court\u2019s antecedent finding of probable cause while, at the same time, safeguarding the accused\u2019s interest in attempting to persuade the court that, despite the state\u2019s evidence, based upon all the available evidence probable cause is lacking.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">Applying this standard to the respondent\u2019s offer of proof, we conclude that the court improperly refused to permit him to present the evidence he offered. In this respect, it is significant that: (1) Blue was shot and killed by only one bullet; (2) there was no ballistic evidence identifying that bullet as having come from either the respondent\u2019s or Lewis\u2019 weapon; and (3) the state did not claim in the trial court, and specifically disclaimed in oral argument in this court, that the respondent was criminally liable as an accessory. The state\u2019s sole theory is that the respondent fired the fatal shot, and that, although the evidence indicates that they were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>shooting at Blue virtually simultaneously, the respondent and Lewis were not acting in concert with or in aid of each other.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">The respondent offered to produce evidence that: (1) Lewis was shooting at Blue from behind and not from in front of Blue; (2) Lewis admitted to having shot and killed Blue; and (3) James had a motive to incriminate the respondent. On the basis of this evidence, the trial court could have found probable cause that Lewis shot Blue as Blue turned to the right into the alley. In short, if the court credited the evidence that the respondent offered to produce, that evidence could have provided a basis for a determination by the trial court that its finding of probable cause that the respondent killed Blue was rebutted.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Under these circumstances, the court improperly precluded the respondent from introducing this evidence in the transfer hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">This does not mean, of course, that the trial court in this case was required to credit that evidence, or to conclude from it that the finding of probable cause was rebutted.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> It means only that the court was required to view the offer of proof in the appropriate light, then to permit the respondent to introduce the evidence, and then to exercise its judgment and to determine, based upon all the evidence\u2014the state\u2019s and the respondent\u2019s\u2014whether there was probable cause to believe that the respondent intentionally killed Blue.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>These conclusions render it unnecessary to consider the respondent\u2019s remaining claim on appeal, namely, that the court improperly concluded that, under the facts of this case, there could be two inconsistent findings of probable cause. That claim rests on a supposition that it would be improper for the same trial court to find probable cause both that (1) the respondent killed Blue, and (2) Lewis killed Blue. Since the court did not make such findings, we leave the resolution of that issue to a case that properly presents it.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">The order of transfer is reversed, and the case is remanded for a new transfer hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b133-6\"> The respondent appealed to the Appellate Court from the transfer order of the trial court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b133-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a provides: \u201c(a) A person is guilty of murder when, with intent to cause the death of another person, he causes the death of such person or of a third person or causes a suicide by force, duress or deception; except that in any prosecution under this subsection, it shall be an affirmative defense that the defendant committed the proscribed act or acts under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance for which there was a reasonable explanation or excuse, the reasonableness of which is to be determined from the viewpoint of a person in the defendant\u2019s situation under the circumstances as the defendant believed them to be, provided nothing contained in this subsection shall constitute a defense to a prosecution for, or preclude a conviction of, manslaughter in the first degree or any other crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">\u201c(b) Evidence that the defendant suffered from a mental disease, mental defect or other mental abnormality is admissible, in a prosecution under subsection (a), on the question of whether the defendant acted with intent to cause the death of another person.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-9\">\u201c(c) Murder is punishable as a class A felony in accordance with subdivision (2) of section 53a-35a unless it is a capital felony.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b134-6\"> The transfer provisions of General Statutes \u00a7 46b-127 pertain to a child who has \u201cattained the age of fourteen years.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b134-7\"> The petition also alleged delinquency by virtue of the serious juvenile offense of attempted murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-54a and 53a-49, as well as the offenses of criminal use of a firearm, carrying a pistol without a permit, unlawful discharge of a firearm, reckless endangerment, and escape from Long Lane School.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b134-9\"> The state filed a simultaneous motion for transfer pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-126.

One of the principal bases for this conclusion was the fact that \u00a7 46b-127, which at that time made no reference to \u00a7 54-46a, omitted the language of \u00a7 54-46a that a probable cause hearing \u201cshall be confined to the rules of evidence . . . .\u201d Id., 305-306. Thereafter, the legislature enacted No. 90-136 of the 1990 Public Acts, which incorporated, with certain exceptions not relevant here, the procedures of \u00a7 54-46a into \u00a7 46b-127.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b149-7\"> For example, the court could have found probable cause from this evidence that, because James had a motive to incriminate the respondent, his testimony was not worthy of belief, and that it was Lewis, rather than the respondent, who shot Blue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b149-8\"> For example, the court could have credited the respondent\u2019s evidence but nonetheless concluded that its antecedent finding of probable cause was not rebutted.
