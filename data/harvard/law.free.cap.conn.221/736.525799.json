The defendant, the commissioner of transportation, condemned land belonging to the plaintiffs, James D. Greene, Patrick J. Crehan, Richard J. Fricke and James A. Canevari, and determined its value for purposes of condemnation. The plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>appealed to the Superior Court, claiming that the defendant had undervalued their property. The Superior Court disagreed with the plaintiffs, however, and concluded that the defendant had actually overvalued the plaintiffs\u2019 property. Thereafter, the plaintiffs appealed to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the case to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">The plaintiffs were the owners of undeveloped land located in Danbury and Ridgefield. The plaintiffs\u2019 land consisted of approximately twenty-four acres located in Danbury, which was zoned light industrial, and approximately twenty-nine acres located in Danbury and Ridgefield, which was zoned residential. On November 18, 1988, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 13-73 et seq., the defendant condemned the entire property for use in constructing a state highway, and estimated damages to the plaintiffs to be $2,194,000. The defendant deposited that sum with the court in accordance with General Statutes \u00a7 48-11,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>court subsequently paid that amount to the plaintiffs in November, 1988. Dissatisfied with the defendant\u2019s estimate, the plaintiffs appealed to the Superior Court, claiming that they had not been justly compensated for the taking of their property. Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-434a,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the matter was referred to a three member panel of state trial referees.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">At trial, the plaintiffs offered evidence indicating that the highest and best use of the Danbury parcel was as a light industrial development. Vincent McDermott, who was qualified as an expert in the field of land use planning, testified for the plaintiffs. McDermott stated that he had headed a team of experts, hired by the plaintiffs, that had analyzed the development potential of the subject property. The team included John Thompson, a traffic consultant, John Scott, a real estate development consultant, and James MacBroom, a spe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>cialist in civil engineering and water resource engineering. The plaintiffs\u2019 team proposed construction on the Danbury parcel of a light industrial development consisting of two one-story buildings with a total floor area of approximately 300,000 square feet. There was testimony that such a development could be used for research laboratories, warehousing, light manufacturing facilities or corporate offices.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">The plaintiffs offered further evidence tending to prove that it was feasible to construct the proposed development. McDermott testified that, in determining the feasibility of the project, the team had evaluated the property\u2019s topography, soils, potential for sewage disposal, potential for drainage and accessibility. Additionally, they had considered the zoning regulations that were applicable to the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">MacBroom testified that he had investigated the capacity of the property to support the proposed development\u2019s projected sewage disposal, drainage and water supply facilities. MacBroom stated that the property contained a large amount of rock ledge that would have to be removed in order to install the industrial facilities, but that he believed that the ledge was an asset because the plaintiffs could sell the crushed rock for profit. MacBroom testified that, in his opinion, the property was suitable to sustain the required sewage disposal system and drainage facilities, and it could supply sufficient water to support the light industrial use of the property. MacBroom also stated that he believed that the plaintiffs could obtain the necessary approvals to construct the sewage, drainage and water supply systems.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-8\">Regarding access to the property for industrial use, Thompson testified that several of the surrounding roads, particularly Laurel Lane and Starrs Plain Road, would have to be extensively improved, but that such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>improvement was possible, and he believed that all of the necessary approvals could be obtained to complete the project. McDermott further testified that it was his belief that all the permits required to construct the entire development could be obtained within a reasonable time. Regarding whether the development would be marketable, Scott testified that he had analyzed the real estate market to determine the potential demand for the proposed light industrial development. Scott concluded that, in 1988, there was a reasonable probability that there would be a significant demand for that type of facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">As a result of the findings of the plaintiffs\u2019 team, McDermott concluded that, within a reasonable time and with economic feasibility, a light industrial development could be constructed on the Danbury parcel. On the basis of that conclusion, Ronald B. Glendinning, a real estate appraiser, determined that the highest and best use of the plaintiffs\u2019 Danbury parcel was light industrial. He concluded that the highest and best use of the remainder of the land was residential, and he appraised the value of the entire property at $4,409,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">In contrast, the defendant offered evidence to indicate that the highest and best use of the entire parcel, including the Danbury parcel zoned for light industrial use, was residential. Ronald Ravizza, who was in the business of rock removal, questioned the plaintiffs\u2019 conclusion that the rock ledge on the property was an asset. Ravizza testified that, rather than selling excavated rock, he typically disposed of it. Although he conceded that it was possible that the rock could be crushed and sold or even used by the plaintiffs, Ravizza testified that, in his opinion, it would require considerable expense to remove the rock. Kenneth C. Stevens, a soil scientist, testified regarding the feasibility of constructing a sewage disposal system on the property. He stated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>that tests he had performed on the property\u2019s soil demonstrated that it had \u201cextremely rapid permeability.\u201d He concluded that, because of the presence of nearby wetlands, it would be difficult to design the large, on-site sewage disposal system that would be necessary to meet department of environmental protection specifications. Warren Herzig, a supervising sanitary engineer for the department of environmental protection, also testified that he did not believe that the property could adequately absorb the amount of sewage that would be produced by the plaintiffs\u2019 proposed industrial development. Amerigo Scarpa, president of a consulting engineering firm, testified that the cost of developing the Danbury parcel as the plaintiffs proposed would be extremely high. He also testified that Starrs Plain Road and Laurel Lane, the access roads to the parcel, would have to undergo very costly upgrading. Scarpa stated that, in his opinion, it was not economically feasible to develop the Danbury parcel as the plaintiffs had proposed because: (1) the costs were too high; (2) it was questionable whether the appropriate permits would be issued to improve the roads; and (3) it was uncertain whether the zoning commission would approve the sewage system.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">The defendant also offered the testimony of two professional real estate appraisers, Arthur Oles and John Flint. Oles determined that it would be necessary to access the proposed development via Laurel Lane, which ran through a residential zone. He was aware that Danbury zoning regulations prohibited accessing an industrial zone through a residential zone. Accordingly, he determined that the highest and best use of the entire property was residential, and that it was 100 percent likely that the Danbury parcel could, and would, be rezoned as residential. In Oles\u2019 appraisal report, he stated, \u201cgiven the residential character of the surrounding neighborhood, the likelihood of a zone change [of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>the Danbury parcel] from IL-40 industrial to RA-80 residential is considered to be 100 percent.\u201d He also reported that \u201cthe subject property industrial acreage has no utility for industrial use. The highest and best use of this acreage is for single-family residential use, with the likelihood of a zone change to RA-80 residential considered to be 100 percent.\u201d Oles appraised the plaintiffs\u2019 property as having a value of $1,172,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">Flint also concluded that the highest and best use of the entire subject property was residential. Flint testified that he believed that there was inadequate access to the property for industrial purposes and that the property could not support the sewage needs of an industrial use. Flint stated in his appraisal report that the highest and best use for the entire parcel was residential. He stated that his appraisal was contingent upon a zone change, which he believed would occur because the assistant city planner for Danbury had informed him that \u201cthere is a stronger possibility of gaining a residential zone change than developing the parcel for industrial use.\u201d Accordingly, Flint appraised the plaintiffs\u2019 property as residential and placed a value upon it of $1,143,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">The trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision reveals the following findings. It would be more costly to remove the significant amount of bedrock from the plaintiffs\u2019 property than the plaintiffs estimated. Because the sewage system would cross wetlands and because the land was so highly permeable, it would be difficult and costly to install the proposed sewage system. The court also found that the unusual costs of preparing the site, those above and beyond the usual costs of development, would amount to $3,100,000, and the necessary costs of improving Laurel Lane and Starrs Plain Road would amount to $1,600,000, \u201cwhich is far in excess of the plaintiffs\u2019 estimates.\u201d The court also found that the process of securing permits from Danbury, the state of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>Connecticut, and the federal government for industrial development would be long and expensive. The court concluded that the \u201cextremely high\u201d costs of the project made \u201cuse of the premises for light industrial buildings unfeasible.\u201d The court stated that \u201c[t]he proposed subdivision of the plaintiffs . . . has no reasonable probability of reaching fruition in the near future . . . .\u201d Accordingly, the court concluded that the highest and best use of the entire property was residential, assessed the value of the land as $1,763,452 and ordered the plaintiffs to repay the state $430,548.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">In this appeal, the plaintiffs claim that the trial court: (1) improperly valued the Danbury parcel as residential property because it was zoned light industrial; (2) improperly held the plaintiffs jointly and severally liable for payment of the judgment in favor of the defendant; and (3) improperly ordered the plaintiffs to post a bond to secure the judgment being appealed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b766-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b766-10\">The plaintiffs first claim that the trial court improperly concluded that the highest and best use of the Dan-bury parcel was residential and, therefore, incorrectly determined its value as residential property. The plaintiffs assert that the trial court\u2019s conclusion was improper because at the time of its taking the Danbury parcel was zoned industrial, and the trial court failed to find that it was reasonably probable that the zone would be changed to residential. Further, the plaintiffs argue that, even if the trial court found that it was reasonably likely that such a zone change would occur, that finding was not supported by the evidence. We disagree with both of the plaintiffs\u2019 contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>\u201c \u2018The owner of land taken by condemnation is entitled to be paid just compensation. . . .\u2019 \u201d <em>Minicucci </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Transportation, </em>211 Conn. 382, 384, 559 A.2d 216 (1989); Conn. Const., art. I, \u00a7 11. The amount that constitutes just compensation is the market value of the condemned property when put to its highest and best use at the time of the taking. <em>Minicucci </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Transportation, </em>supra; <em>Cappiello </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Transportation, </em>203 Conn. 675, 681, 525 A.2d 1348 (1987); <em>Budney </em>v. <em>Ives, </em>156 Conn. 83, 88, 239 A.2d 482 (1968). In determining market value, \u201cit is proper to consider all those elements which an owner or a prospective purchaser could reasonably urge as affecting the fair price of the land . . . .\u201d <em>Budney </em>v. <em>Ives, </em>supra. Because a change in zoning restrictions obviously could affect the price of real property, \u201cwhere such a change is reasonably probable and not merely a remote or speculative possibility, the probability may properly be considered in the determination of the fair value\u201d of the property. Id.; <em>Transportation Plaza Associates </em>v. <em>Powers, </em>203 Conn. 364, 375, 525 A.2d 68 (1987). \u201c[T]he true issue is, not the value of the property for the use which would be permitted if a change in zone was made, but the value of the property as zoned at the time of the taking as it is affected by the probability of a change.\u201d <em>Budney </em>v. <em>Ives, </em>supra, 89.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b767-7\">Initially, the plaintiffs contend that the trial court failed to find that a change in the zone of the Danbury parcel from industrial to residential was reasonably probable. In the absence of such a finding, the plaintiffs assert that the trial court should have valued the parcel as industrial property. We conclude that the trial court implicitly found that such a zone change was reasonably probable.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>Throughout its memorandum of decision the trial court recognized that, at the time of the taking, the Danbury parcel had been zoned industrial, and that the remainder of the subject property had been zoned residential. The trial court listed numerous reasons why the plaintiffs\u2019 proposed industrial development would be excessively costly to construct, and concluded that it was not feasible. The court also stated that it had considered the testimony of the real estate experts and had given such credibility to that testimony as the court had been convinced it deserved. One of those experts, Oles, had offered evidence to indicate that a zone change of the Danbury parcel from industrial to residential was 100 percent likely. Another expert, Flint, offered evidence that he believed that such a change would occur, as well. Although the court failed to refer explicitly to the probability of a zone change in its memorandum of decision, it stated therein that it valued all of the property, including the industrially zoned Danbury parcel, as residential.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">Unquestionably, it would have been improper for the trial court to value the Danbury parcel as residential if it had found that the property would remain industrially zoned and, therefore, could not be legally used for residential purposes. This, the plaintiffs urge, underscores the magnitude of the trial court\u2019s error in valuing the Danbury parcel as residential without a finding that a change of zone was probable. A far more sensible view of the trial court\u2019s decision, however, is that it recognized that the plaintiffs\u2019 proposed industrial development was not feasible, accepted the testimony of Oles and Flint and concluded that it was reasonably probable that the zone would be changed to residential, but did not explicitly so state in the memorandum. Although Practice Book \u00a7 4059 provides that a memorandum of decision must state conclusions on each claim of law and also the factual bases for those conclusions, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>we have held that it is not essential that each factor which may reasonably affect the value of property be \u201cmeticulously recited in the memorandum.\u201d <em>McDermott </em>v. <em>New Haven Redevelopment Agency, </em>184 Conn. 444, 446, 440 A.2d 168 (1981). Our conclusion that the trial court implicitly found that a zoning change was reasonably probable \u201ccomports with our ordinary practice of reading an ambiguous trial court record so as to support, rather than contradict, its judgment. . . .\u2019\u2019(Citation omitted.) <em>Lauer </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>220 Conn. 455, 469-70, 600 A.2d 310 (1991). Moreover, to the extent that the plaintiffs believed that the trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision was unclear, they had an obligation to move the trial court for articulation, which they failed to do. Practice Book \u00a7 4051;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>McLaughlin </em>v. <em>Bronson, </em>206 Conn. 267, 277-78, 537 A.2d 1004 (1988). Therefore, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s memorandum adequately expressed the court\u2019s finding that industrial development was not feasible and that a zone change to residential was reasonably probable.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">Next, the plaintiffs claim that even if the trial court found that a zone change was reasonably probable, the evidence offered was insufficient to support that finding. We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">When making the difficult determination of whether a zone will be changed in the future, the trial court should cautiously examine the evidence offered. <em>Budney </em>v. <em>Ives, </em>supra, 90. The questions of the highest and best use of property and of the reasonable probability of a zone change are, however, questions of fact for the trier. <em>Stamford Apartments Co. </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>203 Conn. 586, 592, 525 A.2d 1327 (1987); <em>Transportation Plaza Associates </em>v. <em>Powers, </em>supra; <em>Levine </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>174 Conn. 234, 235, 386 A.2d 216 (1978); <em>Lynch </em>v. <em>West Hartford, </em>167 Conn. 67, 74, 355 A.2d 42 (1974). We will not disturb the court\u2019s findings on those issues unless they are clearly erroneous. <em>Transportation Plaza Associates </em>v. <em>Powers, </em>supra, 378.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-8\">In its memorandum of decision, the court stated that the Danbury parcel could not feasibly support an industrial use. Its finding was based upon the evidence that it would be extraordinarily costly to: (1) remove the bedrock from the property; (2) install an effective sewage system; (3) upgrade the surrounding roads; and (4) obtain the necessary permits to complete the project. In addition, Oles and Flint, professional appraisers, offered their testimony regarding the probability of a zone change. Oles stated that he believed that a zone change of the Danbury parcel from industrial to residential was <em>100 percent </em>likely. Flint, having discussed the issue with the Danbury assistant town planner, reported that a zone change was more likely than the use of the Danbury parcel for industrial purposes. The plaintiffs offered no evidence to challenge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>the opinions of Oles or Flint that a zone change was likely, and it was within the trial court\u2019s discretion to accept the testimony of the defendant\u2019s appraisers. <em>Stamford Apartments Co. </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>supra; <em>Transportation Plaza Associates </em>v. <em>Powers, </em>supra, 377-78.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">Although the plaintiffs assert that the defendant\u2019s proof was insufficient in part because they offered no testimony from voting members of the Danbury zoning commission, we have held that \u201c[p]roof of the reasonable probability that land could be put to a particular use need not be established by the testimony of the particular administrative officials involved.\u201d <em>Transportation Plaza Associates </em>v. <em>Powers, </em>supra, 377. While it is true that \u201c[wjishful thinking, optimistic conjecture, speculation, rumor and unfounded prognostications do not furnish a proper basis for a finding that a litigant has proved the reasonable probability of a future change in zone,\u201d the trial court\u2019s decision in this case was firmly based on evidence in the record. <em>Budney </em>v. <em>Ives, </em>supra, 89-90; see <em>Heath </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Transportation, </em>175 Conn. 384, 387-90, 398 A.2d 1192 (1978) (testimony of one appraiser, in conjunction with the observable industrial use in the vicinity was a sufficient basis upon which to find a reasonable probability of a zone change to industrial); <em>Lynch </em>v. <em>West Hartford, </em>supra, 74-75 (testimony of two appraisers, and the fact that the land was currently being used, without objection, for industrial purposes provided sufficient basis to conclude that a zone change to industrial was reasonably probable). The trial court\u2019s finding that the highest and best use of the Danbury parcel was residential was not clearly erroneous. <em>Transportation Plaza Associates </em>v. <em>Powers, </em>supra, 378.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b771-8\">The plaintiffs next claim that the trial court improperly held that they were jointly and severally liable for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>payment of the judgment against them. The plaintiffs assert that, because they held the property as tenants in common, they are liable for payment of the judgment only in proportion to their respective percentage interests in the property. We decline to decide the issue raised by the plaintiffs because the trial court did not, in fact, hold the plaintiffs jointly and severally liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">In its memorandum of decision and in its written judgment, the trial court stated that the plaintiffs had been paid $430,548 in excess of the damage they sustained, and \u201c[t]hey are ordered to repay that amount to the State of Connecticut.\u201d Subsequently, the plaintiffs moved the trial court to articulate whether the plaintiffs\u2019 liability was joint and several or only several. The trial court denied the motion for articulation, stating that, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 48-10,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> its authority was \u201climited to the assessment of damages,\u201d and \u201c[i]t has no authority to decide the issue of the respective liabilities of the plaintiffs to repay the state.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">The plaintiffs state on appeal that, because the trial court denied their motion for articulation, they \u201cshall assume the worst for purposes of this appeal, and consider the liability imposed by the judgment as joint and several . . . .\u201d That assumption is in direct contradiction to the trial court\u2019s explicit statement that it could not decide the issue of the parties\u2019 respective liability for damages. Furthermore, the plaintiffs do not claim that the trial court improperly interpreted its jurisdiction as granted by \u00a7 48-10, or that it improperly refused to decide the issue of their respective liabilities. Because we will not render a purely advisory opinion, we decline the plaintiffs\u2019 invitation to \u201cassume the worst,\u201d and, therefore, will not consider this issue further. <em>Moshier </em>v. <em>Goodnow, </em>217 Conn. 303, 306, 586 A.2d 557 (1991); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number><em>Lehrer </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>214 Conn. 232, 234-35, 571 A.2d 691 (1990); <em>Singh </em>v. <em>Singh, </em>213 Conn. 637, 654, 569 A.2d 1112 (1990). If the plaintiffs are unable to agree with the defendant on their individual responsibility for repayment, that issue will have to be resolved in a separate action.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b760-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 48-11 provides: \u201cWhenever the state takes property under any provision of the general statutes or any special act, and the state and the owner or owners of such property or of any interest therein are unable to agree on the amount to be paid as just compensation for such property, the taking authority shall file, with the clerk of the court to which a petition for the assessment of just damages has been preferred, a statement of the sum of money estimated by such authority to be just compensation for the property or interest therein taken. Such sum shall be deposited in said court to the use of the person or persons entitled thereto and notice of such deposit shall be given to such person or persons by such clerk.
