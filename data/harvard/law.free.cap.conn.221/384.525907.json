The dispositive issue on appeal is whether the doctrine of res judicata acts as a bar to the prosecution of the counterclaim. We conclude that it does and, therefore, we affirm the judgment of the trial court that so concluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">The plaintiff, Carl M. Dunham, Jr., and defendant, Roger S. Dunham, are brothers. This is the third suit<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in their ongoing litigation concerning conflicting claims to the ownership of certain real property originally belonging to their deceased father and mother.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The plaintiff commenced this action alleging that the defendant had unlawfully entered the plaintiff\u2019s airport property located in New Milford. The plaintiff sought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>damages for trespass and also for his loss of use of the property. The plaintiff also sought damages for the defendant\u2019s failure to release an attachment and judgment lien on the property that he caused to be placed on the New Milford land records. In a plea to the court\u2019s equitable jurisdiction, the plaintiff sought to enjoin the defendant\u2019s low level acrobatic flying over the airport property, his erection of additional buildings on the premises, and an order directing the removal of certain buildings that the defendant had already built on the property. Finally, the plaintiff sought damages for libel.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">The defendant filed an answer, several special defenses and a counterclaim. In the counterclaim, the defendant alleged that: (1) the plaintiff had acquired title to the airport in 1974 from their mother, Jessica Scott Dunham; (2) the plaintiff had represented to their mother that he would hold the property for the benefit of the defendant; (3) the plaintiff had paid nothing for the property; (4) the transfer to the plaintiff was the product of undue influence exercised by the plaintiff; (5) the plaintiff held title to the property as constructive trustee for the defendant\u2019s benefit; and (6) the plaintiffs attempts to assert a claim to exclusive ownership of the premises constituted a breach of a fiduciary duty owed to the defendant. By way of relief, the defendant sought: (1) a decree declaring that the plaintiff was a constructive trustee for the benefit of the defendant; (2) a decree ordering the plaintiff to convey the property to the defendant; (3) an accounting; and (4) exemplary damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">The plaintiff filed an answer and a series of special defenses to the counterclaim alleging that the subject matter of the defendant\u2019s counterclaim had been previously litigated between the parties and determined by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>a judgment in the plaintiffs favor. The special defenses claimed, inter alia, that the prior judgment was an absolute bar to subsequent action on the same claims. In his reply, the defendant denied the allegations of the special defenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">The plaintiff moved for summary judgment with respect to the counterclaim. The trial court granted the motion, concluding that the issues sought to be raised therein were barred by: (1) the doctrine of res judicata;* <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (2) laches; and (3) the three year statute of limitations contained in General Statutes \u00a7 52-577.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The trial court further concluded that the defendant lacked standing to pursue the issues raised in the counterclaim. The trial court subsequently rendered judgment for the plaintiff on the defendant\u2019s counterclaim. The defendant appealed to the Appellate Court.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We thereafter transferred the matter to ourselves pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">On appeal, the defendant asks us, inter alia, to reverse the judgment of the trial court because the doctrine of res judicata does not bar his litigating the matters raised in his counterclaim. We agree with the trial court that res judicata bars the counterclaim.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number><em>In Dunham </em>v. <em>Dunham, </em>204 Conn. 303, 305, 528 A.2d 1123 (1987) <em>(Dunham I), </em>we took up the first lawsuit between the same two parties, which we characterized as \u201cconcerning the validity of probate proceedings and <em>inter vivos transfers of family property.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) In that case, the present defendant, Roger S. Dunham, was the plaintiff. His complaint in that suit was in three counts. The first count asked the court to use its equitable powers: (1) to set aside the will of Jessica Dunham; (2) to set aside the probate decree admitting the will to probate; and (3) <em>to impose a constructive trust on all of the lands of Jessica Dunham now owned by the defendant whether received by will or otherwise.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">The second count claimed a breach of contract. Paragraph 16 alleged that \u201c[a]t all times during Jessica Dun-ham\u2019s life, she repeatedly declared to [Roger Dunham] and others that it was her wish and understanding that the airport land would be conveyed to [Roger Dunham] upon and subsequent to her death.\u201d Paragraph 17 claimed, inter alia, that \u201c[Carl Dunham] continuously withheld and concealed from [Roger Dunham] that the airport land was, in fact, not included within the estate of Jessica Dunham, having been ostensibly conveyed by Jessica Dunham to [Carl Dunham] by a deed dated April 3,1974, but not recorded on the land records until October 13,1978, ten days prior to Jessica Dunham\u2019s death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">The third count claimed legal malpractice. Paragraph 22 alleged Carl Dunham\u2019s wrongful conduct. It stated that \u201cwhile acting as attorney for the late Jessica Dun-ham, the estate of the late Jessica Dunham, and [Roger Dunham], all at the same time, [Roger Dunham] has been grievously harmed and damaged in the following respects ... A <em>The wrongful conduct of [Carl Dun-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number><em>ham] in securing the alleged transfer of the airport land from Jessica Dunham, which was a product entirely of his own self-interest and was inconsistent with the interest of his clients, greatly diminished the value of the estate of Jessica Dunham and was intended to hinder [Roger Dunham] in pursuing his claim to the airport land </em>. . . . \u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">Carl Dunham denied the material allegations of the complaint. Thus, within the framework of the pleadings in <em>Dunham I, </em>all of the circumstances attending Jessica Dunham\u2019s 1974 transfer of the so-called airport property were placed in issue. Within the context of what was pleaded, this either included, or could have included, her state of mind at the time of the transfer, the consideration paid for the property and whether Carl Dunham exercised undue influence in connection with the transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">Not only did the pleadings in <em>Dunham I </em>present the same issues raised in the counterclaim here, our examination of the record in that case discloses that those issues were actually litigated in that case. <em>In Dunham I, </em>we concluded that the jury might reasonably have found, inter alia, that \u201c[i]n 1974, Jessica Dunham conveyed to [Carl Dunham] 300 acres of the property she had inherited from the estate of her late husband.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> [Carl Dunham], a member of the bar of this state, acting as Jessica Dunham\u2019s lawyer, prepared all of the documentation in connection with the transaction. That <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>conveyance included the family residence, the inn, <em>the airport, </em>and the office building in which [Carl Dunham] conducted his law practice. [Emphasis added.]</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">\u201cIn 1978, Jessica Dunham executed, in [Carl Dun-ham\u2019s] law office, a will that he had drafted for her. This will left her net residuary estate after taxes, approximately $30,000, to be divided equally among her three children. It also appointed [Carl Dunham] the executor of her estate, forgave and canceled all indebtedness of [Carl Dunham] to Jessica Dunham, and exercised in favor of [Carl Dunham] the power of appointment created by the will of Carl Dunham, Sr., thereby ensuring that [Carl Dunham] would inherit the remaining 600 acres of property that Jessica Dunham had received under Carl Dunham, Sr.\u2019s will. . . .<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">\u201cJessica Dunham died of cancer on October 23,1978. On October 31,1978, [Carl Dunham] asked [Roger Dun-ham] to come to his office to discuss the administration of their mother\u2019s estate. During that meeting, [Carl Dunham] asked [Roger Dunham] to sign several documents to facilitate the administration of the estate. [Roger Dunham], in turn, expressed interest in acquiring title to the airport, which originally had been part of Carl Dunham, Sr.\u2019s estate. <em>He expected to inherit that property because the operation of the airport had been his domain and, on the basis of conversations he had had with his mother, he had understood that property to be part of his inheritance from her estate. </em>[Carl Dun-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>ham] replied that they would \u2018have to start thinking about\u2019 arrangements for the transfer of the airport property. The parties had several similar discussions about the airport property on subsequent occasions. At no time during those discussions, however, did [Carl Dunham] disclose that, as of 1974, he himself held title to the airport, and that under the terms of Jessica Dun-ham\u2019s will, he had acquired absolute fee simple title to the remainder of the property in their mother\u2019s estate.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Dunham I, </em>supra, 305-307.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">At the close of the plaintiff\u2019s case in <em>Dunham I, </em>the trial court granted Carl Dunham\u2019s motion for a directed verdict with respect to the second (breach of contract) and third (legal malpractice) counts of the complaint. The jury thereafter responded affirmatively to Roger Dunham\u2019s interrogatories concerning undue influence in connection with the execution of the will.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The trial court then rendered judgment in favor of Roger Dun-ham with respect to the first count and entered a decree setting aside the admission of Jessica Dunham\u2019s will to probate. On appeal, we affirmed the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">Our rules of res judicata are based on the public policy that \u201ca party should not be able to relitigate a matter which it already has had an opportunity to litigate.\u201d <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (83-DE), </em>190 Conn. 310, 318, 460 A.2d 1277 (1983). From our examination of the record in <em>Dunham I, </em>we conclude that the defendant\u2019s claims of constructive trust, lack of consideration and undue influence in connection with the transfer of the airport property were either addressed or could have been addressed within the framework of the pleadings in the earlier action. \u201c \u2018The doctrine of res judicata provides that a former judgment serves as an absolute bar to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>a subsequent action involving any claims relating to such cause of action which were actually made or which might have been made.\u2019 <em>Gagne </em>v. <em>Norton, </em>189 Conn. 29, 32, 453 A.2d 1162 (1983).\u201d <em>Statewide Grievance Committee </em>v. <em>Presnick, </em>216 Conn. 135, 138-39, 577 A.2d 1058 (1990).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b407-8\"> See <em>Dunham </em>v. <em>Dunham, </em>217 Conn. 24, 584 A.2d 445 (1991), and <em>Dunham </em>v. <em>Dunham, </em>204 Conn. 303, 528 A.2d 1123 (1987).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b407-9\"> The multigenerational character of this seemingly endless dispute is similar to the eternal Chancery proceedings in <em>Jamdyce </em>v. <em>Jamdyce. </em>See C.

The ostensible consideration for the conveyance was approximately $358,000. [Carl Dunham], however, paid no money to Jessica Dunham for the property. Instead, he assumed certain mortgages totaling about $52,000 and another $50,000 in unsecured debts owed by her. In connection with that transaction, [Carl Dunham] also gave her a promissory note for $256,627.75, but [he] never paid any money on that <em>note.\u201dDunham </em>v. <em>Dunham, </em>204 Conn. 303, 306 n.1, 528 A.2d 1123 (1987).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b412-7\"> \u201cJessica Dunham sent a letter, dated August 24,1978, to [Roger Dun-ham] concerning the disposition of the Dunham property. She stated in the letter that she was conveying all of the property to [Carl Dunham], who would manage it, \u2018in order to have one person in charge.\u2019 She also expressed her conviction that [Carl Dunham] would \u2018be fair\u2019 and that her three children would work out any differences of opinion that might arise as a result of this arrangement.\u201d <em>Dunham </em>v. <em>Dunham, </em>204 Conn. 303, 306 n.2, 528 A.2d 1123 (1987).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b413-7\"> There were no interrogatories submitted to the jury concerning the circumstances attending the 1974 transfer of the airport property.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b414-5\"> \"The principles that govern res judicata are described in Restatement (Second), Judgments (1982). The basic rule is that of \u00a7 18, which states in relevant part: \u2018When a valid and final personal judgment is rendered in favor of the plaintiff: (1) [t]he plaintiff cannot thereafter maintain an action on the original claim or any part thereof, although he may be able to maintain an action upon the judgment . . . .\u2019As comment (a) to \u00a7 18 explains, \u2018[wjhen the plaintiff recovers a valid and final personal judgment, his original claim is extinguished and rights upon the judgment are substituted for it. The plaintiffs original claim is said to be \u201cmerged\u201d in the judgment.\u2019 Our recent case law has uniformly approved and applied the principle of claim preclusion or merger. See <em>Gagne </em>v. <em>Norton, </em>189 Conn. 29, 32, 453 A.2d 1162 (1983); <em>Corey </em>v. <em>Avco-Lycoming Division, </em>[163 Conn. 309, 317, 307 A.2d 155 (1972), cert. denied, 409 U.S. 1116, 93 S. Ct. 903, 34 L. Ed. 2d 699 (1973)].</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">\u201cBecause the operative effect of the principle of claim preclusion or merger is to preclude relitigation of the \u2018original claim,\u2019 it is crucial to define the dimensions of that \u2018original claim.\u2019 The Restatement (Second), Judgments provides, in \u00a7 24, that \u2018the claim [that is] extinguished includes all rights of the plaintiff to remedies against the defendant with respect to all or any part of the transaction, or series of connected transactions, out of which the action arose. What factual grouping constitutes a \u201ctransaction\u201d, and what groupings constitute a \u201cseries\u201d, are to be determined pragmatically, giving weight to such considerations as whether the facts are related in time, space, origin, or motivation, whether they form a convenient trial unit, and whether their treatment as a unit conforms to the parties\u2019 expectations or business understanding or usage.\u2019 In amplification of this definition of \u2018original claim,\u2019 \u00a7 25 of the Restatement (Second) states that \u2018[t]he rule of \u00a7 24 applies to extinguish a claim by the plaintiff against the defendant even though the plaintiff is prepared in the second action (1) [t]o present evidence or grounds or theories of the case not presented in the first action, or (2) [t]o seek remedies or forms of relief not demanded in the first action.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">\u201cThe transactional test of the Restatement provides a standard by which to measure the preclusive effect of a prior judgment, which we have held to include \u2018any claims relating to the cause of action which were actually made or might have been made.\u2019 <em>Corey </em>v. <em>Avco-Lycoming Division, </em>supra, 317; <em>Gagne </em>v. <em>Norton, </em>supra, 32. In determining the nature of a cause of action for these purposes, we have long looked to the \u2018group of facts which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>is claimed to have brought about an unlawful injury to the plaintiff; <em>Bridgeport Hydraulic Co. </em>v. <em>Pearson, </em>139 Conn. 186, 197, 91 A.2d 778 (1952); and have noted that \u2018[e]ven though a single group of facts may give rise to rights for several different kinds of relief, it is still a single cause of action.\u2019 Id.\u201d <em>Duhaime </em>v. <em>American Reserve Life Ins. Co., </em>200 Conn. 360, 364-65, 511 A.2d 333 (1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
