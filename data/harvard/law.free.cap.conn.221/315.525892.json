After a jury trial he was convicted of felony murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54c<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and carrying a pistol without a permit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 29-35 and 29-37 (b).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He was sentenced to a term of forty-five years imprison<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>ment on his felony murder conviction and to a consecutive term of five years on his conviction of carrying a pistol without a permit, for a total effective sentence of fifty years imprisonment. The defendant took a direct appeal from that judgment to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">The jury could reasonably have found, from the evidence produced at trial, that the defendant shot and killed Dwayne Hollyfield on December 23, 1988, at approximately 11:30 p.m., near the intersection of Stillman and Kossuth Streets in Bridgeport. The jury also could reasonably have found that the shooting occurred while the defendant was attempting to rob Hollyfield of a microwave oven, contained in a cardboard carton, that Hollyfield was transporting in a supermarket shopping cart.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">The defendant does not dispute the sufficiency of the evidence to prove his guilt. He does, however, claim that he is entitled to a reversal of his conviction and a new trial because of certain rulings of the trial court and because of comments made by the prosecuting attorney in his closing argument. We affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">The defendant first contends that the trial court improperly overruled his motion to suppress admissions that he had made to Detective David Silva of the Bridgeport police department at the Bridgeport police headquarters on the evening of December 26, 1988, shortly after he was apprehended.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> From the evidence adduced at a suppression hearing and at trial the court could reasonably have found the following relevant facts. The defendant, who was seventeen years old and had had prior experience with the police, was apprehended on December 26, at the home of his girlfriend. Thereafter, he was taken to Bridgeport police headquarters where he was advised of his Miranda<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> rights by Silva, who used a standard police rights form for that purpose. At the suppression hearing Silva testified that, in his presence and that of another police officer, the defendant, after he had been advised of his rights, had executed the uppermost portion of the waiver form, had initialed each individual warning of rights and had signed the rights form at the bottom. Silva further testified that he was aware that the defendant had been advised of his rights on previous occasions and that, when advised of his rights on this occasion, the defendant appeared to understand them and had no trouble communicating or expressing himself clearly. Silva also testified that after the defendant had been advised of his rights and had executed the waiver, the defendant had said, \u201cI will tell you about it, but I wouldn\u2019t give a statement.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thereafter, Silva <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>testified, the defendant told him that he had been followed by Hollyfield, that the two had argued, and that Hollyfield had slapped him in the face, whereupon the defendant had shot him. The defendant denied that he was attempting to rob Hollyfield of the microwave oven. Silva said that he had made no record, either written or taped, of the defendant\u2019s admissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">The defendant initially argues in support of his suppression claim that his admissions should have been suppressed because they were not knowingly and intelligently made. This argument is premised on the defendant\u2019s claim that had he fully understood the implications of his oral admissions, i.e., that they could be used against him, he would not have made them. He contends that he obviously did not intend to waive his right to remain silent because, although he agreed to tell Silva what had happened, he refused to give \u201ca statement.\u201d The defendant argues, therefore, that in making his oral admissions, he did not recognize the consequences of his action and, therefore, could not have acted with the \u201cfull awareness\u201d required for a valid waiver of his right to remain silent and not to incriminate himself. He claims that, as a result, his oral admissions were not knowingly and intelligently made and should not have been admitted at trial. We disagree.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">This claim of the defendant is foreclosed by our decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Barrett, </em>205 Conn. 437, 450, 534 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>219 (1987). \u201cIn <em>Barrett, </em>we held that an accused had knowingly and intelligently waived his federal right against self-incrimination despite the fact that he refused to commit anything to writing and would provide only oral statements to the police.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>220 Conn. 602, 613-14, 600 A.2d 1330 (1991); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>188 Conn. 574, 580, 452 A.2d 634 (1982), cert. denied, 460 U.S. 1089, 103 S. Ct. 1785, 76 L. Ed. 2d 354 (1983); <em>State </em>v. <em>Frazier, </em>185 Conn. 211, 225, 440 A.2d 916 (1981), cert. denied, 458 U.S. 1112, 102 S. Ct. 3496, 73 L. Ed. 2d 1375 (1982). An analogous factual situation and similar reasoning also support the conclusion in the instant case that, as in <em>Barrett, </em>the defendant had validly waived his right to remain silent. Contrary to the defendant\u2019s suggestion, the law does not require the police to counsel a suspect about the various modes of communication that might qualify as admissible evidence at trial, so long as the police give him appropriate <em>Miranda </em>warnings and ascertain his understanding that he has a right to remain silent and that anything he says can be used against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">The defendant next claims that his statement should not have been admitted into evidence at his trial because it was not made voluntarily. We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">\u201cThe use of an involuntary statement of a defendant in a criminal trial violates a defendant\u2019s right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>due process of law. <em>State </em>v. <em>Boscarino, </em>204 Conn. 714, 740, 529 A.2d 1260 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>200 Conn. 465, 475, 512 A.2d 189 (1986). As a prerequisite to admissibility the state is required to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that under all the circumstances admissions by an accused were voluntarily made. <em>Lego </em>v. <em>Twomey, </em>404 U.S. 477, 489, 92 S. Ct. 619, 30 L. Ed. 2d 618 (1972); <em>State </em>v. <em>Chung, </em>202 Conn. 39, 53, 519 A.2d 1175 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Stankowski, </em>184 Conn. 121, 131, 439 A.2d 918, cert. denied, 454 U.S. 1052, 102 S. Ct. 596, 70 L. Ed. 2d 588 (1981); <em>State </em>v. <em>Vollhardt, </em>157 Conn. 25, 34, 244 A.2d 601 (1968). The issue of whether [admissions are] voluntary and admissible is, in the first instance, one of fact for determination by the trial court in the exercise of its legal discretion. <em>State </em>v. <em>Derrico, </em>181 Conn. 151, 162, 434 A.2d 356, cert. denied, 449 U.S. 1064, 101 S. Ct. 789, 66 L. Ed. 2d 607 (1980); <em>see Jackson </em>v. <em>Denno, </em>378 U.S. 368, 395, 84 S. Ct. 1774, 12 L. Ed. 2d 908 (1964). Our usual deference to the trial court\u2019s finding on questions of this nature is qualified by the necessity for an independent examination of the entire record to determine whether the trial court\u2019s finding of voluntariness is supported by substantial evidence. <em>State </em>v. <em>Toste, </em>198 Conn. 573, 576, 504 A.2d 1036 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>DeForge, </em>194 Conn. 392, 398, 480 A.2d 547 (1984). <em>State </em>v. <em>DeAngelis, </em>200 Conn. 224, 232, 511 A.2d 310 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Chung, </em>supra, 54.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Kane, </em>218 Conn. 151, 160, 588 A.2d 179 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">An examination of the record leads us to conclude that there is substantial evidence to support the trial court\u2019s finding that the defendant\u2019s admissions were freely and voluntarily made. Our review clearly indicates that under all the circumstances, including the defendant\u2019s age and experience, there was no police conduct that \u201cwas such as to overbear [the defendant\u2019s] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>will to resist and bring about [a statement] not freely self-determined . . . .\u201d <em>Rodgers </em>v. <em>Richmond, </em>365 U.S. 534, 544, 81 S. Ct. 735, 5 L. Ed. 2d 760 (1961); <em>State </em>v. <em>Boscarino, </em>supra, 740; <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra, 477; <em>State </em>v. <em>Shifflett, </em>199 Conn. 718, 727, 508 A.2d 748 (1986).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This claim of the defendant is unfounded.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">The defendant next contends that certain comments made by the prosecutor during closing argument concerned the defendant\u2019s election not to testify and violated his constitutional and statutory right to remain silent, and thereby denied him a fair trial. See <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>426 U.S. 610, 619, 96 S. Ct. 2240, 49 L. Ed. 2d 91 (1976); <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>California, </em>380 U.S. 609, 615, 85 S. Ct. 1229, 14 L. Ed. 2d 106, reh. denied, 381 U.S. 957, 85 S. Ct. 1797, 14 L. Ed. 2d 730 (1965); see also General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 54-84, 54-1b and 54-1c.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">In a portion of his closing argument, the prosecuting attorney stated, \u201cNow, the way the situation is worked out and the way that you heard it occurred, you know that there are only two people in the world who would tell you exactly what happened there on December the 23rd, 1988. You know one of the those people was Dwayne Hollyfield.\u201d Then, after briefly discussing Hollyfield\u2019s life style and importuning the jury not to let that life style diminish the seriousness of the offense, the prosecutor said, \u201cThe other person who knows exactly what happened on December 23rd, 1988, is sitting right over there next to [defense counsel].\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>Immediately thereafter, however, the prosecutor stated, \u201cY ou would not know that but for the fact that he made three\u2014at least three very serious mistakes\u2014 serious errors in judgment after he committed the murder. [Number one] in misjudging his relationship with Zaida Figueroa and telling her what happened. [Number two,] by failing to anticipate that by telling Yen McGee, his friend, he goes over and tells Yen McGee. Somewhere down the line Mr. McGee gets put in a situation where it becomes a better idea to tell what he knows than to try to mislead the police. And perhaps his biggest mistake is not realizing the significance of telling David Silva at the police department what he told him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">The defendant, at trial, did not object to the prosecutor\u2019s remarks, nor did he take an exception, ask for a mistrial or a curative instruction, or otherwise indicate to the court any displeasure with the prosecutor\u2019s argument. Because he failed to preserve his claim at trial, the defendant now requests that we review the claim under <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>165 Conn. 61, 327 A.2d 576 (1973), and <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 567 A.2d 823 (1989). He also argues that it should be reviewed as plain error under Practice Book \u00a7 4185.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>In determining whether a prosecutor\u2019s comments have encroached upon a defendant\u2019s right to remain silent we have espoused the following criterion. \u201c \u2018A test for evaluating a prosecutor\u2019s argument that has been adopted by several courts and approved by the Court of Appeals of this circuit in <em>United States ex rel. Leak </em>v. <em>Follette, </em>418 F.2d 1266, 1269 (2d Cir.), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Leak </em>v. <em>Follette, </em>397 U.S. 1050, 90 S. Ct. 1388, 25 L. Ed. 2d 665 [1970], seems adequate and properf, that is]: \u201cWas the language used manifestly intended to be, or was it of such character that the jury would naturally and necessarily take it to be a comment on the failure of the accused to testify?\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>206 Conn. 300, 307, 537 A.2d 1021 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">In this case, we conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s remarks would reasonably have been interpreted by the jury, not as a comment on the defendant\u2019s failure to testify, but rather to have been an observation that the defendant, who knew what had happened, had informed three others that he had shot someone on Stillman Street on December 23, 1988, that the three in turn had testified as to what they had been told, and that the jury, therefore, had for its consideration the defendant\u2019s own account of what had transpired. That, indeed, appears to be the more cogent construction to be attributed to the prosecutor\u2019s argument. At any rate, the segment of the argument complained of was not \u201cmanifestly intended to be, [nor] was it of such character that the jury would naturally and necessarily take it to be a comment on the failure of the accused to testify.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>supra, 307; <em>United States ex rel. Leak </em>v. <em>Follette, </em>supra, 1269. \u201c[A] court should not lightly infer that a prosecutor intends an ambiguous remark to have its most damaging meaning or that a jury, sitting through lengthy exhortation, will draw that meaning from the plethora of less damaging interpretations.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number><em>Donnelly </em>v. <em>DeChristoforo, </em>416 U.S. 637, 647, 94 S. Ct. 1868, 40 L. Ed. 2d 431 (1974). Because there was no clear constitutional violation, and the defendant did not raise this issue at trial, we refuse to review it further. <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 240. Moreover, the failure of the trial court, sua sponte, to take action was not plain error given the interpretation that could reasonably be placed on the prosecutor\u2019s remarks.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">The defendant next claims that the trial court violated his rights to confront witnesses, to present a defense, to due process and to a fair trial when it denied him the opportunity to present extrinsic evidence that his former paramour, Zaida Figueroa, had not been truthful in her response to some questions asked of her on cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">On cross-examination, counsel for the defendant inquired extensively of Figueroa concerning her relationship with the defendant. At one point in that inquiry he asked Figueroa if she had communicated with the defendant while he had been in custody since his arrest. She denied having done so. Thereafter, when shown letters addressed to the defendant\u2019s custodial lodging, she denied having written them.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">In an effort to impeach Figueroa\u2019s credibility by demonstrating that the facts were inconsistent with her testimony on cross-examination, the defendant attempted to enter the letters into evidence. In his effort to do so, he made an offer of proof outside the presence of the jury. That offer consisted of the testimony of Deborah Fabrizi, who had been a close friend of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>Figueroa. Fabrizi identified the letters as having been written by Figueroa to the defendant. She testified that she was knowledgeable as to the source of the letters because she had seen Figueroa write them; she had read some of the letters; and she recognized Figueroa\u2019s handwriting. She described the letters as \u201clovey dovey\u201d letters from Figueroa to the defendant. She also testified that she knew that the defendant had received the letters because she was aware that the defendant and Figueroa had discussed them over the telephone.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">The state objected to the admission of the letters and Fabrizi\u2019s testimony. The trial court sustained the state\u2019s objection on the ground that the evidence was collateral and irrelevant. The defendant took an exception to the court\u2019s ruling. He did not, however, in the trial court make any constitutional claim in conjunction with his exception. See Practice Book \u00a7 288;<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> see also <em>Mays </em>v. <em>Mays, </em>193 Conn. 261, 268, 476 A.2d 562 (1984). The defendant argues again, however, that we should now examine the constitutional claim he raises on appeal under <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>supra, and <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">A witness may not be impeached by contradicting his or her testimony as to collateral matters, that is, matters that are not directly relevant and material to the merits of the case. <em>State </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>173 Conn. 317, 327, 377 A.2d 1082 (1977); <em>State </em>v. <em>Carbone, </em>172 Conn. 242, 262, 374 A.2d 215, cert. denied, 431 U.S. 967, 97 S. Ct. 2925, 53 L. Ed. 2d 1063 (1977); <em>State </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>158 Conn. 321, 324, 260 A.2d 571 (1969). Further, the trial court has broad discretion in ruling on the admissibility of evidence and the scope of cross-examination to show contradictory statements. <em>State </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>202 Conn. 463, 482, 522 A.2d 249 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Reed, </em>174 Conn. 287, 304, 386 A.2d 243 (1978). We will not disturb that discretion unless a clear abuse is demonstrated. <em>State </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>197 Conn. 595, 601, 500 A.2d 551 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">In this instance we conclude that it was within the trial court\u2019s discretion to have made a determination that the letters and Fabrizi\u2019s testimony were collateral to any issue linked to a proper determination of the defendant\u2019s responsibility for Hollyfield\u2019s death and were, therefore, not admissible. Because the court\u2019s ruling was within its discretion, the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights were not violated. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Fullwood, </em>199 Conn. 281, 284, 507 A.2d 85 (1986). The defendant\u2019s rights to confront and cross-examine witnesses and to present a defense do not give him the right to have admitted any evidence he chooses. \u201c Tn the exercise of [those rights], the accused, as required of the State, must comply with the established rules of procedure and evidence designed to assure both fairness and reliability in the ascertainment of guilt and innocence.\u2019 <em>Chambers </em>v. <em>Mississippi, </em>410 U.S. 284, 302, 93 S. Ct. 1038, 35 L. Ed. 2d 297 (1973) . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Kemp, </em>199 Conn. 473, 479, 507 A.2d 1387 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>208 Conn. 365, 376, 545 A.2d 1048 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">Because the record fails to disclose that a constitutional violation clearly exists, we refuse to review further this claim of the defendant. <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 240.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">The defendant\u2019s final claim is that the trial court improperly allowed the jury to hear testimony that the defendant was a sentenced prisoner. The defendant contends that divulging this information to the jury was so prejudicial that it deprived him of a fair trial and requires reversal. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">During the course of the trial, Edward Davies, the deputy warden of the Bridgeport Correctional Center, was called as a witness by the defendant. Davies, who was in possession of the defendant\u2019s institutional records, testified as to the number of visits by Figueroa to the defendant while the defendant was housed in the Manson Youth Institution in Cheshire.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> During the cross-examination of Davies by the state, Davies was asked if he knew whether the defendant\u2019s status at Cheshire had been that of a sentenced or unsentenced prisoner. The defendant objected to the question. The court thereupon told that witness that he could answer the question, \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno.\u201d Davies, however, apparently not understanding the court\u2019s admonition, answered, \u201cAt the time he was at Manson, he was sentenced.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The trial court immediately, sua sponte, granted an \u201cexception\u201d to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">The defendant did not move that Davies\u2019 answer be stricken, nor did he move for a mistrial or request a curative instruction. Immediately after Davies\u2019 answer, the inquiry took another tack, and there was no further exploration of the defendant\u2019s status as a sentenced or unsentenced prisoner. No explanation was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>given to the jury concerning the difference between a sentenced and an unsentenced prisoner, no mention was made of any of the crimes for which the defendant had been sentenced and the state did not refer to the defendant\u2019s status when it made its final arguments. Moreover, despite the lack of a request, the trial court incorporated a curative instruction addressing Davies\u2019 answer in its charge to the jury. That instruction clearly informed the jury that any reference in Davies\u2019 testimony to the defendant\u2019s status was not to be used as evidence of guilt.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">There appears to have been no justification for the admission into evidence of Davies\u2019 answer to the prosecutor\u2019s question and the state does not argue that the answer was admissible. The state does argue, however, that this issue has assumed an importance on appeal that it does not appear to have had at trial. We agree. At trial, Davies\u2019 answer was not viewed by the defendant as sufficiently prejudicial to warrant a motion to strike, a motion for a mistrial, or a request for a curative instruction. When counsel does not choose to make a request for a curative instruction or a mistrial, \u201che presumably does not view the remarks as so prejudicial that his client\u2019s right to a fair trial is seriously jeopardized.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Falcone, </em>191 Conn. 12, 23 n.13, 463 A.2d 558 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">Moreover, despite the lack of a request for a curative instruction, the trial court did deliver a charge to the jury that clearly informed the jurors that they were not to consider the defendant\u2019s status as any evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>of guilt. \u201cThe jury are presumed to follow the court\u2019s directions in the absence of a clear indication to the contrary.\u201d <em>State </em>v.
