At the close of the pleadings, the defendants moved for summary judgment claiming that the action is barred by the Connecticut recreational land use act, General Statutes \u00a7 52-557f et seq.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The trial court granted the motion. Upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>appeal, the Appellate Court affirmed, concluding that \u00a7 52-557g grants immunity to both the municipality and its employees. <em>Manning </em>v. Barenz, 24 Conn. App. 592, 590 A.2d 980 (1991). We thereafter granted the plaintiffs\u2019 petition for certification limited to the following issues: (1) whether the recreational land use act, \u00a7 52-557\u00cd et seq., applies to (a) municipalities, and (b) municipal employees; and (2) if the act does apply, whether it applies to the conduct of these defendants with respect to this particular storage box. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>An examination of the pleadings and affidavit supporting the motion for summary judgment discloses the following. On August 8, 1986, the named plaintiff, Keith T. Manning, a two year old boy, was playing at Pershing Park, a municipal park owned by the town of Bloomfield and open to the public without charge. While the named plaintiff was reaching into a large metal box where the town kept toys and other recreational items, the lid of the box fell on his thumb causing serious injuries. At the time of the incident, the town was conducting a summer recreational program for residents from the ages of six to thirteen; the named plaintiff was not enrolled or participating in that program. The defendant municipal employees managed and supervised the park and the summer recreational program at the park.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">The plaintiffs<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> first claim that the recreational land use act, \u00a7 52-557\u00cd et seq., and specifically \u00a7 52-557g (a), which limits the liability of an owner of land to persons using the land for recreational purposes, does not apply to municipalities. They argue that because \u00a7 52-557g (a) is ambiguous as to whether a municipality should be considered an \u201cowner of land,\u201d we should seek guidance from the legislative history and relevant case law interpreting the statute. The plaintiffs maintain that because the legislative history and <em>Genco </em>v. <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co., </em>7 Conn. App. 164, 168-69, 508 A.2d 58 (1986), indicate that one purpose behind the statute was to encourage private land owners to open their land to public use, it follows that the phrase, \u201cowner of land,\u201d should be strictly construed to include only private land owners. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>The plaintiffs have offered no reasonable explanation why the phrase, \u201cowner of land,\u201d should be considered ambiguous nor do we see any. \u201cWhere the language of the statute is clear and unambiguous, it is assumed that the words themselves express the intent of the legislature and there is no need for statutory construction or a review of the legislative history.\u201d <em>All Brand Importers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Liquor Control, </em>213 Conn. 184, 195, 567 A.2d 1156 (1989). The definition of \u201cowner\u201d in \u00a7 52-557f (3) includes \u201cthe possessor of a fee interest.\u201d It is undisputed that the defendant municipality possesses the fee interest in the park in question. In order to fall within the purview of \u00a7 52-557g (a), the defendant municipality must establish only that it is the possessor of the fee interest in land available to the public without charge for recreational purposes. This it has done.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We conclude that \u00a7 52-557g applies to all land owners\u2014municipal and private.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">The plaintiffs next argue that even if the recreational land use act; \u00a7 52-557f et seq.; applies to municipalities, it does not apply to municipal employees.* ***<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The plaintiffs claim, inter alia, that because municipal employees cannot be considered \u201cowners of land\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 52-557g (a) and the statute does not specifically extend immunity to them, the defendant employees should be held liable. They contend, further, that the defendant municipality should indemnify their employees, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 7-465.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>conclude that \u00a7 52-557f et seq. extends to a municipality\u2019s employees and, therefore, we do not reach the indemnification issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">Pursuant to \u00a7 52-557f (3), \u201cowner\u201d means, inter alia, a \u201cperson in control of the premises.\u201d The persons in control of the premises here were those who managed and supervised the park, i.e., the defendant employees. The plaintiffs concede as much in their complaint in their description of the defendant employees\u2019 duties. The named defendant, Harold Barenz, director of parks and recreations for the town of Bloomfield, is described as \u201ccharged with the care, control, and supervision of all parks and recreational facilities, including summer programs, within the . . . town.\u201d The three remaining defendant employees are described as charged with the supervision of the summer recreational program and with the care and protection of the children participating in the program. Because the defendant employees must be considered within the definition of \u201cowners\u201d by reason of their being \u201cpersons in control of the premises,\u201d they fall within the immunity created by this statute. To hold otherwise would render the statute meaningless. The plaintiffs could completely bypass this legislation by simply bringing suit against the municipal employee and then requiring the municipality to indemnify its employee pursuant to \u00a7 7-465.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">The plaintiffs\u2019 final claim is that even if the recreational land use act; General Statutes \u00a7 52-557\u00cd et seq.; applies to municipalities and their employees, it should not apply to the conduct of these defendant employees. The plaintiffs argue that: (1) their allegations of failure to supervise are distinguishable from the immunity granted pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>suant to \u00a7 52-557g (a) that refers to failures to warn of <em>\u201ca </em>dangerous condition, use, structure or activity on the land\u201d; (2) the metal box was moveable and thus not \u201cland\u201d as required in order to qualify for the statutory immunity; and (3) the plaintiff was not at the park for a recreational purpose and, therefore, the municipality should not be protected by this statute. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">Pursuant to \u00a7 52-557g (b) (3), an owner of land who permits free access to the land for recreational purposes does not thereby \u201cassume responsibility for or incur liability for any injury to person . . . caused by an act or <em>omission </em>of the owner\u2019 \u2019 except in the case of wilful or malicious acts. (Emphasis added.) Any alleged failure to supervise the named plaintiff here would clearly constitute an omission and would, therefore, be covered by this statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">The issue whether the metal box should be considered \u201cland\u201d is irrelevant in light of the extension of immunity for \u201can act or omission of the owner\u201d with respect to a \u201cdangerous condition, use, <em>structure </em>or activity on the land.\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 52-557g (a) and (b) (3). The metal box is clearly a structure on the land; the statute neither requires the metal box to be considered \u201cland,\u201d or to be affixed to the land, in order for the immunity in question to apply to the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">The plaintiffs\u2019 attempt to characterize the activity leading to the injury at issue as not being within the definition of \u201crecreational purpose\u201d is also without merit. While it is true that children\u2019s play at a park is not one of the enumerated \u201crecreational purposes\u201d listed in \u00a7 52-557f (4),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> this statute clearly states that \u201c \u2018[recreational purpose\u2019 includes, but is <em>not limited </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number><em>to, </em>any of the following . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) It is evident that the enumerated activities set forth in the statute are not exclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b279-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-557\u00cd provides: \u201clandowner liability for RECREATIONAL USE OF land, definitions.

Manning\u2019s claim for personal injuries was brought through his mother, the plaintiff Michelle Cooper.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b282-5\"> There is no need to resort to the legislative history in this case but we do note our agreement with the Appellate Court\u2019s analysis of <em>Genco </em>v. <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co., </em>7 Conn. App. 164, 508 A.2d 58 (1986), which does interpret the legislative history. \u201cIn <em>Genco, </em>we applied the statute to owners of private property who had opened Candlewood Lake to the public for recreational purposes without a fee. In discussing the legislative history and the purpose of the statute, we stated that \u2018the clear purpose of [General Statutes] \u00a7 52-557g is an attempt to satisfy the public\u2019s need for recreational and open space by encouraging private landowners, through limiting their liability, to open their land to public use.\u2019 Id., 168-69. That the statute was intended to encourage private landowners to open their property for the use and enjoyment of their fellow citizens is not disputed. The issue presented in this case is, however, whether the statute is <em>limited </em>to private property owners. The purpose of making available recreational and open space is not thwarted by the application of the clear and unambiguous language of the statute to governmental property owners as well as private property owners. We, therefore, do not interpret the <em>Genco </em>case as limiting the application of the statute, but, rather, as applying the statute appropriately to the facts of that case, i.e., applying the statute to a private property owner.\u201d <em>Manning </em>v. <em>Barenz, </em>24 Conn.
