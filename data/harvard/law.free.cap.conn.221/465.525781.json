(CBI), and its president, Charles Bassman, seeking damages for personal injuries suffered by Grant while, as a minor, he was illegally employed by CBI. CBI moved to dismiss the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint on the ground that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because Grant had applied for and received workers\u2019 compensation benefits for his injuries and, thus, was precluded from bringing this action by General Statutes \u00a7 31-284 (a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>trial court granted CBI\u2019s motion and the plaintiffs appealed to the Appellate Court. We transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023. We reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">The plaintiffs\u2019 revised complaint alleged the following. Grant was born on August 25,1969. While a minor, Grant was employed as a laborer by CBI in its excavation contracting business. As part of his duties, Grant was required to operate certain equipment owned and used by CBI in its business, including a backhoe. The defendants employed Grant in an occupation determined to be hazardous by the Connecticut state labor department, in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1987) \u00a7 31-23 (b), (c) and (d),* <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and \u00a7 31-23-1 of the Regu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>lations of Connecticut State Agencies. Bassman hired Grant with the knowledge that he was a minor and instructed him to start the backhoe by placing a screwdriver across the metal contact points on the starter motor while standing next to the engine compartment and between the wheels. The backhoe was equipped with a safety neutral switch to prevent it from starting while in gear. This switch had been disconnected, however, and was maintained in an inoperable condition. On June 17, 1987, while starting the backhoe as he had been instructed, Grant suffered serious and permanent physical injuries when the backhoe started and crushed him beneath a rear wheel.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">The record reveals that Grant applied for and began receiving workers\u2019 compensation benefits for his injuries while he was still a minor.* *<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A determination has not been made, however, concerning Grant\u2019s entitlement to temporary total disability benefits, specific disability benefits or additional compensation benefits. As a defendant, CBI intervened in this action as a third party plaintiff and has notified the plaintiffs of its claim, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-293 (a),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> for reim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>bursement of benefits paid to Grant. CBI filed a motion to dismiss, claiming that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because Grant\u2019s application for and receipt of workers\u2019 compensation benefits precluded him, pursuant to \u00a7 31-284 (a), from bringing this action. The trial court granted CBI\u2019s motion.* ***<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On appeal, the plaintiffs claim that the trial court improperly concluded that: (1) an illegally employed minor who exercises his right to workers\u2019 compensation benefits is barred from pursuing his common law rights; (2) an illegally employed minor who exercises his right to workers\u2019 compensation benefits has ratified his employment contract and thereby has elected to forego his common law rights; and (3) to show \u201cserious and willful misconduct\u201d by his employer, Grant had to show that CBI deliberately intended to injure him.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">The plaintiffs argue that our decision in <em>Blancato </em>v. <em>Feldspar Corporation, </em>203 Conn. 34, 522 A.2d 1235 (1987), stands for the proposition that an illegally employed minor, such as Grant, is not governed by the exclusive remedy provisions of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, and, therefore, may pursue <em>both </em>a workers\u2019 compensation claim and a common law tort action. CBI contends that <em>Blancato </em>requires an illegally employed minor either to avoid the employment contract by bringing a common law tort action or to ratify the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>tract by pursuing his workers\u2019 compensation remedy. CBI argues that, by applying for and receiving workers\u2019 compensation benefits, Grant ratified the employment contract and is thereby precluded under \u00a7 31-284 (a) from bringing a common law action. Because we conclude that CBI\u2019s claim that the plaintiff had made an exclusive election of remedies was not properly raised by a motion to dismiss, we do not reach the substantive issues raised by the parties in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">In its motion to dismiss, CBI claimed that Grant had elected his exclusive remedy by applying for and receiving workers\u2019 compensation benefits. CBI asserted that as a result of this election, the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over this action. CBI argued, rather, that the workers\u2019 compensation commission had sole jurisdiction over the plaintiffs\u2019 claims. The trial court dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint against CBI on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">\u201c \u2018Subject matter jurisdiction is the power of the court to hear and determine cases of the general class to which the proceedings in question belong.\u2019 \u201d <em>LeConche </em>v. <em>Elligers, </em>215 Conn. 701, 709, 579 A.2d 1 (1990), quoting <em>Shea </em>v. <em>First Federal Savings &amp; Loan Assn. of New Haven, </em>184 Conn. 285, 288, 439 A.2d 997 (1981). We start with the premise that the Superior Court has subject matter jurisdiction over a common law negligence action. The question raised by the present case is whether Grant\u2019s commencement of a proceeding with the workers\u2019 compensation commission ousted the trial court of such jurisdiction. \u201cThat determination must be informed by the established principle that every presumption is to be indulged in favor of jurisdiction. . . .\u201d <em>LeConche </em>v. <em>Elligers, </em>supra, 709-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>This court has not squarely addressed the question of whether a claim that an injured plaintiff has elected workers\u2019 compensation as his exclusive remedy deprives the Superior Court of subject matter jurisdiction over a tort action for personal injury. In the past, parties have raised and we have reviewed claims that an injured plaintiff\u2019s exclusive remedy is under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act both by way of a motion to dismiss and by way of a special defense. Compare <em>Pallanck </em>v. <em>Donovan, </em>105 Conn. 591, 136 A. 471 (1927) (plea in abatement), with <em>Mancini </em>v. <em>Bureau of Public Works, </em>167 Conn. 189, 355 A.2d 32 (1974) (special defense), and Bates v. <em>Connecticut Power Co., </em>130 Conn. 256, 33 A.2d 342 (1943) (special defense). Because these cases did not address the propriety of the procedural posture, however, \u201c[w]e do not read our case law ... as conclusively deciding that such a claim is subject matter jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Gurliacci </em>v. <em>Mayer, </em>218 Conn. 531, 543, 590 A.2d 914 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">In <em>Fusaro </em>v. <em>Chase Brass &amp; Copper Co., </em>21 Conn. Sup. 240, 154 A.2d 138 (1956), the trial court discussed the appropriate procedural mechanism for raising a claim that an injured plaintiff has made an exclusive election of workers\u2019 compensation. In that case, the defendant filed a plea to the jurisdiction and in abatement on the ground that workers\u2019 compensation was the plaintiff\u2019s exclusive remedy.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The court sustained the plaintiff\u2019s demurrer to the plea, concluding that the matter raised by the plea should properly have been raised by a special defense in the answer. Id., 244. In referring to the predecessor to \u00a7 31-284 (a), the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>stated: \u201cIt is true that our compensation act provides (Rev. 1949, \u00a7 7419) that as to an employee covered by it, \u2018the employer shall not be liable to any action for damages on account of personal injury.\u2019 <em>This provision, however, is not at all a denial of jurisdiction in the Superior Court, as such, but is basically a destruction of an otherwise existent common-law right of action. </em>The facts alleged in the plea to the jurisdiction would, if proven, establish such a destruction. Consequently, they constitute matter in bar. The confusion, if there be any, arises from the fact that the compensation procedure which is substituted for the common-law right of action involves a special tribunal, rather than the Superior Court. However, this is a mere incident of the destruction of the common-law right of action. <em>In other words, there is not a lack of jurisdiction in the court but a want of a cause of action in the plaintiff. </em>\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 243; see also <em>Gurliacci </em>v. <em>Mayer, </em>supra, 541-45 (suit against fellow employee not subject to motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">We agree with the reasoning of the court in <em>Fusaro </em>that a claim that an injured plaintiff has made an exclusive election of workers\u2019 compensation is properly raised by a special defense.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The purpose of a special <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>defense is to plead facts that are consistent with the allegations of the complaint but demonstrate, nonetheless, that the plaintiff has no cause of action. Practice Book \u00a7 164. The claim that a plaintiff has elected an exclusive remedy relies on facts outside those alleged in the complaint that operate to negate what may once have been a valid cause of action. 1 E. Stephenson, Connecticut Civil Procedure (2d Ed.) \u00a7 127, p. 519. It is therefore both rational and fair to place the burden of pleading and proving an election of remedies on the party asserting the claim, usually the defendant. \u201cIt is sufficient to require the plaintiff to allege facts showing that at one time, at least, he had a cause of action. It would be an undue burden to require him to negate the occurrence of any and all subsequent events that could operate to destroy his cause of action.\u201d Id. In the present case, CBI asserted in a motion to dismiss that regardless of the truth of the allegations in the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint, they could not maintain a common law action because Grant had elected workers\u2019 compensation as his exclusive remedy. We conclude, however, that a special defense, and not a motion to dismiss, was the proper procedural vehicle for CBI\u2019s challenge to the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to deny the motion to dismiss and for further proceedings according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b488-8\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 31-284. basic rights and liabilities, civil ACTION TO ENJOIN NONCOMPLYING EMPLOYER FROM ENTERING EMPLOYMENT contracts, (a) An employer shall not be liable to any action for damages on account of personal injury sustained by an employee arising out of and in the course of his employment or on account of death resulting from personal injury so sustained, but an employer shall secure compensation for his employees as follows, except that compensation shall not be paid when the personal injury has been caused by the wilful and serious misconduct of the injured employee or by his intoxication.
