We transferred the appeal to this court from the Appellate Court in accordance with Practice Book \u00a7 4023, and now reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-4\">The following facts are not in dispute. On April 6, 1986, the claimant was seriously injured when the vehicle she was driving collided with a vehicle owned and operated by Raymond Petronis. The claimant\u2019s vehicle was owned by her father, Eugene O\u2019Neill, and insured by Aetna. At the time of the incident, the claimant was residing with her sister and brother-in-law, Catherine and Joseph Jazwicz. The Jazwiczes were the named insureds under the CNA automobile policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">Petronis had liability insurance on his vehicle through American Universal, which paid the policy limit of $100,000 to the claimant. The claimant then brought claims under the underinsured motorist provisions policy issued by Aetna, the insurer of the claimant as the operator of the covered vehicle, and the policy issued by CNA, the insurer of the claimant as a resident relative of the Jazwiczes. Both the Aetna and the CNA policies contained identical \u201cother insurance\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>clauses that provided: \u201cIf there is other applicable similar insurance, we will not pay for any damages which would duplicate any payment made for damages under such similar insurance. However, any insurance we provide with respect to a vehicle you do not own, to which other similar insurance is applicable, shall be excess over such other applicable insurance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">Pursuant to the terms of the policies, the claims went to arbitration and the parties stipulated to the following: (1) the claimant was covered under both the Aetna and CNA policies; (2) at the time of the accident, the Aetna policy provided a total of $300,000 of underinsured motorist coverage, and the CNA policy provided underinsured motorist coverage for two vehicles in the amount of $300,000 each, for a total of $600,000 of underinsured motorist coverage; and (3) there was a credit of $100,000 from the tortfeasor\u2019s payment. The arbitration panel found that the claimant had suffered damages in the amount of $400,000 and awarded her $300,000 pursuant to the underinsured motorist coverage. The arbitration panel concluded that the insurer providing coverage on the vehicle involved in the accident was primary, and that the insurer providing coverage as a result of the claimant being a resident relative of the named insureds\u2019 household was excess. The panel, therefore, concluded that Aetna\u2019s coverage should be exhausted before CNA would be obligated to pay underinsured motorist benefits. After giving Aetna the full $100,000 credit for the payment by the tortfeasor, the panel ordered Aetna to pay the first $200,000 of underinsured motorist coverage and CNA to pay the additional $100,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">Aetna filed a motion in the Superior Court to vacate the award and the claimant filed a motion to confirm the award, which were consolidated and heard jointly by the trial court. The court concluded that because the \u201cother insurance\u201d clauses in both the Aetna and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>CNA policies were in conflict, it would treat both insurers as primary and prorate the amount of the benefits between them according to their limits of liability. The court then ordered Aetna to pay $85,714.28 to the claimant and CNA to pay the claimant $214,285.72.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">On appeal, CNA claims that the court erred in not finding that the Aetna policy was primary and that the CNA policy was excess in providing underinsured motorist benefits to the claimant. The issue of the validity of \u201cother insurance\u201d clauses for the purpose of determining the priority of payment between insurers is one of first impression in this court. We conclude that \u201cother insurance\u201d clauses are valid for the purpose of establishing the order of coverage between insurers, as long as their enforcement does not compromise coverage for the insured. A careful reading of the Aetna and the CNA policies in their entirety reconciles any possible conflict and establishes that the Aetna policy provides primary coverage while the CNA policy provides excess coverage to the claimant. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">At the outset, we note that the original reason for \u201cother insurance\u201d clauses was to prevent overinsurance and double recovery under fire and property insurance policies. Since, however, \u201cthere is less temptation to deliberately and fraudulently overinsure against automobile liability, these other insurance clauses function solely to reduce or eliminate the insurer\u2019s loss in the event of concurrent coverage of the same risk.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>(Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Werley </em>v. <em>United Services Automobile Assn., </em>498 P.2d 112, 117 (Alaska 1972).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">Aetna contends that in <em>Pecker </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>171 Conn. 443, 453, 370 A.2d 1006 (1976), this court invalidated \u201cother insurance\u201d clauses in uninsured motorist provisions for all purposes. Aetna has misinterpreted our holding. In <em>Pecker, </em>the issue before us was whether such a clause was enforceable to prevent the insured from stacking multiple uninsured motorist coverages in cases in which the claimant had not been wholly indemnified for his damages. We held that when a claimant\u2019s damages exceed the uninsured motorist coverage available against any one policy, resulting in only partial indemnification for the claimant, \u201cother insurance\u201d clauses are invalid to prohibit the claimant from stacking coverages. The cornerstone of our holding in <em>Pecker </em>was the public policy behind the enactment of the uninsured motorist statutes and regulations affording an insured full indemnification for the injuries suffered. Id., 448-51; see also <em>Allstate Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Ferrante, </em>201 Conn. 478, 482, 518 A.2d 373 (1986) (\u201cwe have repeatedly held that General Statutes \u00a7 38-175c permits an injured claimant to \u2018stack\u2019 coverages\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b807-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>The present appeal presents an entirely different scenario. Here, the \u201cother insurance\u201d clauses apportion underinsured motorist liability between insurers. Public policy is not violated when \u201cother insurance\u201d clauses are used for the purpose of establishing the order of payment between insurers. When the insured is afforded full indemnification for a loss, there is no public policy issue controlling how insurers divide coverage among themselves. See <em>Farmers Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Prudential Property &amp; Casualty Ins. Co., </em>10 Kan. App. 93, 97-98, 692 P.2d 393 (1984); P. Morello, \u201cThe Problem of Multiple Uninsured Motorist Coverages: Who Pays?\u201d 62 Conn. B.J. 358, 364 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">We conclude, therefore, that if a careful reading of the language of the policies in their entirety reconciles any conflict or ambiguity that may arise when identical or similar \u201cother insurance\u201d clauses exist, and if the enforcement of the clauses would not produce adverse consequences for the insured, then the clauses should be enforced as written. See R. Keeton, Insurance Law (1971) \u00a7 3.11 (b), p. 173; see also <em>Farmers Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Prudential Property &amp; Casualty Ins. Co., </em>supra, 396 (\u201c \u2018 \u201cOther insurance\u201d excess coverage clauses do not seek to dilute, condition or limit statutorily mandated coverage. Rather, they seek only to establish priority as to which policy should be exhausted first in satisfying the liability. ... We see no public policy question in how insurance companies divide among themselves the loss occasioned by their communal insured.\u2019 \u201d); <em>State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>United Services Automobile Assn., </em>211 Va. 133,137-38,176 S.E.2d 327 (1970) (\u201cWe see nothing in the excess coverage clause involved herein which adds to or restricts the uninsured motorist stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>ute. . . . The excess coverage clause merely provides an orderly process for determining the distribution of liability among several insurance carriers.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\">We begin our review of the \u201cother insurance\u201d provisions in the Aetna and CNA policies by noting that \u201c[t]he rule in Connecticut is that an insurance policy, like any other contract, must be given a reasonable interpretation and the words used are to be given their common, ordinary and customary meaning. <em>Gottesman </em>v. <em>Aetna Ins. Co., </em>177 Conn. 631, 634, 418 A.2d 944 (1979); <em>Lyon </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>140 Conn. 304, 307, 99 A.2d 141 (1953).\u201d <em>Izzo </em>v. <em>Colonial Penn Ins. Co., </em>203 Conn. 305, 309, 524 A.2d 641 (1987). The general rules of contract construction, therefore, apply when construing the terms of an insurance policy. \u201cWhere the language of the contract is clear and unambiguous, the contract is to be given effect according to its terms.\u201d <em>Barnard </em>v. <em>Barnard, </em>214 Conn. 99, 110, 570 A.2d 690 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">In construing the language of the policies, we start with the stipulation that the claimant was covered under both policies. Indeed, the definitions within the provisions make this clear. Both policies define a \u201ccovered person\u201d in their uninsured motorist provisions as, inter alia: \u201c1. You or any family member. 2. Any other person occupying your covered auto.\u201d Therefore, Aetna provided underinsured motorist coverage to the claimant as a \u201ccovered person\u201d because she was occupying a vehicle owned by the named insured, Eugene O\u2019Neill, and CNA provided underinsured motorist coverage to the claimant because she was a family member who was residing in the household of the named insureds, Catherine and Joseph Jazwicz.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b809-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>The essential language to be construed in the policies is \u201c[a]ny insurance we provide with respect to <em>a vehicle you do not own, </em>to which other similar insurance is applicable, shall be excess over such other applicable insurance.\u201d (Emphasis added.) It is clear that both Aetna and CNA contemplated in their respective \u201cother insurance\u201d clauses that the policy issued by each would be excess in situations where the covered person was injured in a vehicle \u201cyou\u201d do not own. In order to determine to whom the word \u201cyou\u201d in each clause refers, we consult the definition of that word within the policies. Both policies provide: \u201cThroughout this policy, \u2018you\u2019 and \u2018your\u2019 refer to: 1. The \u2018named insured\u2019 shown in the Declarations; and 2. The spouse if a resident of the same household.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">Accordingly, the Aetna policy, by its own terms, does not envision being excess in this situation because the claimant was injured while occupying a vehicle owned by Eugene O\u2019Neill, the named insured in the Aetna policy. Therefore, the Aetna policy is primary and its \u201cother insurance\u201d clause does not apply. Conversely, the CNA policy is excess because the claimant was <em>not </em>injured while an occupant in a vehicle owned by the Jazwiczes, the named insureds in the CNA policy. The only reason CNA is providing underinsured motorist coverage is because the claimant is a resident relative of the named insureds, and thus, a covered person under the CNA policy. We find no conflict between the policies because only one insurer, Aetna, could be primary. The policies themselves, therefore, dictate that we hold that the Aetna underinsured motorist coverage be primary and that the CNA underinsured motorist coverage be excess.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to reinstate the award of the arbitration panel and to render judgment accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b803-6\"> We have long held that if \u201c \u2018a claim is made against an insured\u2019s uninsured motorist coverage after it is determined that the at-fault party is underinsured, the [statutes and] regulations which apply to uninsured motorist coverage must equally apply to underinsured motorist coverage.\u2019 \u201d <em>General Accident Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Wheeler, </em>221 Conn. 206, 210-11, 603 A.2d 385 (1992), quoting <em>Nationwide Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Gode, </em>187 Conn. 386, 399-400, 446 A.2d 1059 (1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b805-7\"> Although the trial court does not explain its mathematical calculations, we assume that it gave to each insurer a full credit of $100,000, which represented the payment from the tortfeasor. The credit reduced Aetna\u2019s total underinsured motorist coverage to $200,000 and CNA\u2019s total underinsured motorist coverage to $500,000, for a total coverage of $700,000 available to the claimant. The court then prorated the available coverage between the insurers and ordered Aetna to pay two-sevenths of the loss, or $85,714.28, and CNA to pay five-sevenths of the loss, or $214,285.72.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b806-6\"> There are three types of \u201cother insurance\u201d clauses for underinsured motorist coverage: (1) excess; (2) pro rata; and (3) escape. An \u201cexcess insurance\u201d clause, such as the one employed by the parties in the present appeal, provides that, if there is other valid insurance covering the loss, the excess policy applies only if the claimant\u2019s loss exceeds the policy limits of the primary insurer. 8A J. &amp; J. Appleman, Insurance Law and Practice (1981) \u00a7 4906, pp. 347-49. A \u201cpro rata\u201d other insurance clause provides that if there is other valid coverage, the insurer is liable only for its pro rata share of the loss, that is, the proportion that its policy limits bears to the total applicable policy limits. 8A J. &amp; J. Appleman, supra, \u00a7 4906, pp. 345-46. An \u201cescape\u201d other insurance clause provides that the existence of other uninsured motorist coverage eliminates the insurer\u2019s liability to the claimant of that other insurance. 8A J. &amp; J.
