The intervening defendant, Farmland Dairies (Farmland), a New Jersey based dairy manufacturer and supplier of milk and other dairy products, applied to the Connecticut department of agriculture for a license to sell and distribute milk in this state. The defendant, the commissioner of agriculture (commissioner), granted a license to Farmland. Thereafter, the plaintiff, New England Dairies, Inc., a Connecticut based milk dealer, appealed the commissioner\u2019s decision to the Superior Court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 (a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On December 31, 1990, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>Superior Court dismissed the appeal. The plaintiff then appealed to the Appellate Court, and the defendants each cross appealed.* <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We transferred the case to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023. We affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">The briefs of the parties reveal the following undisputed facts. In January, 1989, Farmland applied to the department of agriculture for a license to sell and distribute milk in Connecticut. In the course of reviewing Farmland\u2019s application, the department of agriculture inspected Farmland\u2019s New Jersey dairy plant in August, 1989, and again in June, 1990. The inspectors determined that, at those times, Farmland\u2019s facilities did not conform to the requirements of the Connecticut department of agriculture. On December 8, 1989, the plaintiff sent a letter to the commissioner describing conduct by Farmland that the plaintiff believed should be considered by the commissioner prior to the issuance of a Connecticut milk dealer\u2019s license to Farmland. Specifically, the plaintiff maintained that it possessed information indicating that Farmland was in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 22-231 (7),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and should not be granted a license. The commissioner informed the plaintiff that it would hold a hearing on Farmland\u2019s application, and that the plaintiff\u2019s concerns would be among the issues addressed at the hearing. Prior to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>the commencement of the hearing, the plaintiff requested that it be granted party status at the proceedings. The hearing officer designated by the commissioner denied that request, but granted the plaintiff intervenor status.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">On November 1,1990, the hearing commenced before the hearing officer. Shortly after the opening of the hearing, the department of agriculture announced that its inspectors had reinspected Farmland\u2019s facilities, and that Farmland had passed the inspection. On November 5, 1990, prior to the introduction by the plaintiff of any evidence of the alleged misconduct by Farmland, the commissioner issued a license to Farmland to sell and distribute milk and dairy products in Connecticut. Since the hearing no longer had a purpose, it was adjourned by the hearing officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">On November 7, 1990, the plaintiff appealed to the Superior Court pursuant to \u00a7 4-183 (a) claiming that the hearing was improperly terminated. Farmland successfully moved to be joined as a party defendant in the appeal. Subsequently, both defendants moved to dismiss the plaintiff\u2019s appeal, claiming that the Superior Court was without jurisdiction to hear the appeal because: (1) the hearing before the department of agriculture was not a \u201ccontested case\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 4-183 (a) and General Statutes \u00a7 4-166 (2) and (3);<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>(2) the plaintiff was not aggrieved pursuant to \u00a7 4-183 (a). Farmland raised a third ground for dismissal in its motion, claiming that the plaintiffs appeal should be dismissed because the plaintiff had failed to exhaust its administrative remedies as required by \u00a7 4-183 and General Statutes \u00a7 22-248.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Superior Court concluded that the plaintiff had been aggrieved, and that it had exhausted its administrative remedies, but the court dismissed the plaintiffs appeal concluding that it had no jurisdiction to hear the appeal because the plaintiff had not appealed from a \u201ccontested case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">The plaintiff argues that the Superior Court improperly dismissed its appeal because the hearing before the department of agriculture was a contested case from which it had a right of appeal. We agree with the trial court that the plaintiff had not appealed from a contested case.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>The UAPA grants the Superior Court jurisdiction over appeals of agency decisions only in certain limited and well delineated circumstances. General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 (a). Generally, the UAPA requires that an appeal be taken from a \u201cfinal decision.\u201d Section 4-166 (3) defines a final decision as: \u201c(A) the agency determination in a contested case, (B) a declaratory ruling issued by an agency pursuant to section 4-176 or (C) an agency decision made after reconsideration.\u201d The plaintiff\u2019s sole contention in its appeal to this court is that the commissioner\u2019s decision to grant a milk dealer\u2019s license to Farmland was a final decision because it constituted a \u201cdetermination in a contested case\u201d as contemplated by \u00a7 4-166 (3) (A). \u201cA \u2018contested case\u2019 is defined as \u2018a proceeding ... in which the legal rights, duties or privileges of a party are <em>required by statute </em>to be determined by an agency after an <em>opportunity for hearing </em>or in which a hearing is <em>in fact </em>held . . . .\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>Rybinski </em>v. <em>State Employees\u2019 Retirement Commission, </em>173 Conn. 462, 469, 378 A.2d 547 (1977); General Statutes \u00a7 4-166 (2). Furthermore, we have determined that even in a case where a hearing is \u201cin fact held,\u201d in order to constitute a contested case, a party to that hearing must have enjoyed a statutory right to have his \u201clegal rights, duties or privileges\u201d determined by that agency holding the hearing. <em>Herman </em>v. <em>Division of Special Revenue, </em>193 Conn. 379, 383 n.5, 477 A.2d 119 (1984); <em>Rybinski </em>v. <em>State Employees\u2019Retirement Commission, </em>supra, 469-73; <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>171 Conn. 691, 697, 372 A.2d 102 (1976). In the instance where no party to a hearing enjoys such a right, the Superior Court is without jurisdiction over any appeal from that agency\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">The plaintiff asserts that the hearing in this case was mandated because the commissioner is statutorily required to conduct a hearing on an application for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>milk dealer\u2019s license when he is presented with a \u201creasonable basis\u201d to believe that grounds for refusing that license \u201cmay exist.\u201d The plaintiff further asserts that the allegations in its letter to the commissioner presented a reasonable basis upon which to deny Farmland\u2019s application for a license. General Statutes \u00a7 22-234 provides in relevant part: \u201cBefore refusing to grant or renew, or before suspending, revoking or refusing to transfer, a license, the commissioner of agriculture shall afford the applicant or licensee an opportunity to be heard before him or his designated agent.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 22-231 sets forth specific bases upon which the commissioner may \u201crefuse to grant or renew a license, or may suspend, revoke or refuse to transfer a license already granted . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>By its plain language, \u00a7 22-234 entitles an applicant for a license to a hearing only prior to an action by the commissioner that would <em>detrimentally </em>affect the applicant. Nothing in \u00a7 22-234, or any provision of the UAPA, however, entitles any party to a hearing concerning an application for a milk dealer\u2019s license prior to the <em>granting </em>of such application.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\">The plaintiff claims that the legislature, in adopting \u00a7\u00a7 22-231 and 22-234, intended to obligate the commissioner to conduct a hearing on an application for a milk dealer\u2019s license if reasonable grounds upon which the license could be refused were presented. The plaintiff asserts that any other interpretation of those statutes would lead to the bizarre circumstance in which the commissioner could decide not to hold a hearing, despite evidence tending to indicate that an applicant should not be issued a license. Such a result, it contends, would harm both consumers of dairy products and dairy competitors.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">\u201c \u2018To determine the collectively expressed legislative intent, we look first to the language of the statute itself. If that language is plain and unambiguous, we go no further. . . .\u2019 \u2019\u2019(Citations omitted.) <em>Ralto Developers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Environmental Impact Commission, </em>220 Conn. 54, 60, 594 A.2d 981 (1991). We conclude that the language of \u00a7 22-234 plainly does not require that the commissioner conduct a hearing prior to the <em>granting </em>of a milk dealer\u2019s license. Because a license was granted to Farmland, the commissioner was not required to conduct any hearing at all on Farmland\u2019s application. The hearing conducted by the commissioner, therefore, did not constitute a contested case. Consequently, the Superior Court was correct when it determined that it had no jurisdiction to hear the plaintiff\u2019s appeal.
