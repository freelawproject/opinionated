The record showed a suit by W. EL Perkins against James EL Fisher in- the Circuit Court of- Daviess County for the recovery of money and a judgment therein for Fisher. Afterwards this judgment was reversed by the Court of Appeals of the state, and the cause remanded for further proceedings. When the case got back, to the Circuit Court additional pleadings were filed and a trial had, which resulted in a judgment in favor of Perkins for less than $1000. From this judgment Fisher appealed to the Court of Appeals. Before this appeal was decided\" the Superior Court of the state was organized, and the case was transferred, in due course of law, to that court for decision.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b553-6\">Those parts of the act establishing\" the Superior Court, which relate to the appellate jurisdiction .of the Court of Appeals for the review of its judgment\u00bb are as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b553-7\">\u201c \u00a7 5.

But if, in any case coming within either of the above exceptions, any two of the judges of the Superior Court shall certify that, in their opinion, bhe' question involved is novel, and is one of sufficient importance, the party against whom the decision was rendered shall be entitled to take the same by appeal to the Court of Appeals as ' in other cases.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b554-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>\u201c \u00a7 6.

Stat. The Court of Appeals is the highest court of the state of Kentucky, and, consequently, until it has been made to appear affirmatively on the face of the record that a decision in this suit could not have been had in that court, we are not authorized to review the judgment of the Superior Court. Although the value in controversy is less than $1000, and the judgment of the inferior court was affirmed by the Superior Court without a dissenting vote, an appeal did lie to the Court of Appeals if two of the judges of the Superior Court certified that, in their opinion, the question involved was novel and of sufficient importance.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-12\">To get an appeal from the Superior Court in any case ah <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>application therefor must be made to and granted by that court; Such is the express provision of \u00a7 7 of the act under which the court was organized. Certainly it would not be claimed.that a judgment of the Superior Court could be reviewed by this court in a case not within the exceptions mentioned in \u00a7 5 before an application had been made in proper time for the allowance of an appeal, and the application refused for some sufficient reason. ' It is tru,e that in this particular case the prayer for an appeal could not have been granted, unless the necessary certificate was given; but if given, it would have been as much the duty of the court to make the-order of allowance as it would if the value in controversy had exceeded one thousand dollars, or the judgment of affirmance had been with a dissenting vote. Such a certificate enters into and forms part of the allowance of an appeal in a case like this, and an application for the allowance necessarily includes an application for the certificate,, unless it has been obtained before, because the certificate is one of the ingredients of an allowance. The want of a certificate is good reason for refusing to allow an appeal, but until it has been asked for and refused its absence furnishes no ground for a writ of error from this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">The principle on which this case rests is illustrated by what was decided in <em>Gregory </em>v. McVeigh, 23 Wall. 294. In Virginia, the Supreme Court of Appeals is the highest court - of the state. Judgments of the Corporation Court of Alexandria can only be taken there for review on, leave of the Court of Appeals itself or some judge thereof. Gregory, against whom a judgment had been rendered in the Corporation Court, applied to each and every one of the judges of the Court of Appeals for a writ of error, but his applications were all rejected because the judgment was \u201c plainly right.\u201d This, by a statute of Virginia, was a bar to any application to the court for the same purpose, and Gregory thereupon sued out a writ of error from this court to the Corporation Court, as the highest court of the state in which a decision in the suit could be had. Upon a motion to dismiss we upheld our jurisdiction, because everything had been done that could be to take the case to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>Court of Appeals, aud its doors had \u201cbeen forever closed against the suit, not through neglect, but in the regular order of proceeding under the law governing the practice.\u201d Had the court itself refused the leave upon an application for that purpose, its refusal would have been equivalent to a judgment of affirmance, which could have been reviewed in this court; but as in the regular course of proceeding that had been done which prevented either a review of a judgment of the Court of Appeals or an application to that court for a writ of error, the judgment of the Corporation Court had become the judgment of the highest court of the state in which a decision in that suit could be had, and consequently was reviewable here as such.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">So, here, if an application to the Superior Court for an appeal had been refused, the doors of the Court of Appeals would have been closed against the suit, and we could have proceeded accordingly. As it is, we find nothing in the record to show that the suit could not have been taken to the Court of Appeals if the necessary application had been made, and, consequently, we have no right to proceed. It matters not that the judgment of the Superior'Court is in accordance with what was decided by the Court of Appeals on the former appeal. The judgment is still the judgment- of the Superior Court,' which is not the highest court of the state, and it might have been taken to the Court of Appeals for review if the grant of an appeal had been applied for and secured. <em>McComb </em>v. <em>Commissioners of Knox </em>County, 91 U. S. 1; <em>Kimball </em>v. Evans, 93 U. S. 320; <em>Davis </em>v. Crouch, 94 U. S. 514, 517. We are not to assume that an appeal would not have been granted if applied for. The record must show its refusal.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">\n<em>The motion to dismiss is gromied.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
