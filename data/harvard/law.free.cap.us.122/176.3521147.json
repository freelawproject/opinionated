M. Sanger, the appellant, to foreclose a mortgage. The bill was brought against William Nightingale, as executor of Phineas M. Nightingale, his father, Mrs. Ellen D. Nightingale, the widow, and John K. Nightingale, and others, children of Phineas, deceased, the maker of the original mortgage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b207-8\">Sanger, the plaintiff below, was a citizen of New York, and the other parties were mainly citizens of the state of Georgia.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b207-9\">This mortgage was made in the city of New York, on December 6, 1869, by Phineas M. Nightingale, who was a resident of Georgia.. It conveyed to Sanger, the appellant, certain property in the state of Georgia, known as Camber\u2019s Island, in the Altamaha Diver. Three notes of $10,000 each accompanied the mortgage, payable respectively in one, two and three years, with semiannual inter\u00e9st at the rate of seven per cent per annum. It was to secure the payment of these notes that the mortgage was made, and it was duly recorded January 28, 1870, after having been properly acknowledged.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b207-10\">No money was ever paid upon this mortgage, either by way of principal or interest. Nightingale, the mortgagor, died in April, 1873, and William Nightingale became the executor of his will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b207-11\">There were several mortgages on this property prior to the one to'the plaintiff, which were properly recorded so as to con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>stitute notice to Sanger, as well as to all other subsequent purchasers or incumbrancers. When Sanger came to file his bill to foreclose his mortgage, which he did April 8, 1883, it became necessary for him to bring these mortgages to the attention of the court. The principal, and only one of them, as the case presents itself to.us, which is necessary to-be considered, was one made by Nightingale, on January 30, 1855, to Charles Spalding, which included' Camber\u2019s' Island and a- very large amount of landed estate beside, as well as'some-120 slaves rer siding upon the estate so mortgag\u00e9d. *' This mortgage had been assigned, for the consideration .of $100,000, by: Spalding ta. Edmund Molyneux, who afterwards died, and' -\u00bfis Widow and heirs had removed to England. The executor of the estate of Molyneux had taken judgment against Nightingale before his death-for the sum due on the bonds secured by the mortgage to Spalding, and he had also foreclosed the mortgage-- of Nightingale to Spalding, the property had been sold, and a deed made by the sheriff under that sale to William Nightingale, son of Phineas.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b208-4\">All this occurred in the lifetime of the latter.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b208-5\">The bill of complaint of Sanger assailed this proceeding by which the mortgage to Spalding was foreclosed, and the title of the property came into the hands of William, as the result of a fraudulent combination on the part of Phineas M. Nightingale, his debtor, and William Nightingale, as representing the children of Phineas M. Nightingale, Mrs. Molyneux, and the executor of Molyneux, to' defraud him of his just claims under the mortgage of December, 1869. In reciting the means by which this fraud was carried out he said that Phineas M. Nightingale, the mortgagor in both mortgages, conveyed on July 21, 1870, to Mrs. Molyneux, the yidow and real party in interest as heir or devisee of Molyneux, then dead, a tract of land known as \u201c Dunginess,\u201d which was received by Mrs. Molyneux and intended by Nightingale to be a complete satisfaction of - the Spalding mortgage. He further asserted that the Spalding bonds' and mortgage jwere then turned over t\u00f3 P.-, -M. Nightingale, either by a written assignment, or accompanied with an indorsement showing that they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>were satisfied; that P. M. Nightingale afterwards procured this mortgage to be foreclosed and Camber\u2019s Island sold under it and brought in by his son William without any consideration-being paid for it, and solely for the purpose of cutting off the right of Sanger under his mortgage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b209-5\">The answer of the Nightingales denied this combination and fraud, and by way of explanation said that Dunginess was received by Mrs. Molyneux at the sum of $25,000, credited on the Spalding' mortgage; that a question at that time existed as to how far the loss of the slaves who had been emancipated, which were included in' the mortgage of Nightingale to. Spalding, and the consideration of which was the land-and negroes mortgaged, would be treated as a failure of consideration; that this question was also settled at the time that Dunginess was conveyed to Mrs. Molyneux, and that an adjustment of that matter was made by which, after the receipt of the deed of conveyance of Dunginess, it was agreed that the sum of $51,250 remained due upon that mortgage. N They denied all combination to defeat the plaintiff in his mortgage; they asserted that the foreclosure of the mortgage was a <em>Iona fide </em>attempt tq enforce the collection of the remaining sum of $51,250, and that William Nightingale gave his note for the sum of $30,000, for which the property was sold.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AA7\">The plaintiff afterwards filed an amended bill, in which he adopted \"the version of the settlement between Mrs. Molyneux and Phineas M. Nightingale, by which Dunginess was received as part payment only,. and the mortgage was foreclosed for the remaining sum, after deduction for the loss of the slaves, the balance of the bonds remaining unpaid. But in regard to the foreclosure proceedings on that mortgage he said, that-at the time they -were instituted the debt was barred by the limitation law of March 16, 1869, of the General Assembly of Georgia, and that at the time the bonds and mortgage on which that proceeding was instituted were taken by the children of said Phineas M. Nightingale, by the assignment and transfer of the executor of the Molyneux estate, the said bonds and mortgage were all past due and barred by said act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>of 1869.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He further averred that the failure of said Phineas to plead the statute of limitations in bar of the foreclosure did not and could not affect, the right of the complainant to now avail himself of said statute of limitation. He then requested, the court to decree the said foreclosure void, by virtue of said limitation law, against the claim and right of complainant. 4 Woods, 483.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b210-5\"><em>Mr. Henry B.

In <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Terrell, </em>54 Ga. 462, the court holds: <em>\u201c </em>One who purchases mortgaged property, prior to the commencement of statutory proceeding to foreclose, and who is not a party to such proceedings, is not bound by the judgment of foreclosure, and may, when the <em>mortgagef.fa. </em>is levied, go behind-the judgment and set up that the mortgage was barred by the statute of limitations at the date of- the filing the petition to foreclose.\u201d See also <em>Lilienthal </em>v. <em>Champion, </em>58 Geo. 158, where it is held that a pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>chaser before foreclosure proceedings may go behind the judgment and show usury.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b211-5\">Also, <em>Stokes </em>v.

So whatever knowledge Sanger may have had of the foreclosure of the Spalding mortgage in McIntosh Superior Court, he could not have interposed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b211-8\">The question arises, if it be lawful for Sanger to take advantage of this statute of March, 1869, being a junior mortgagee, when he could without doubt have taken advantage of it, after foreclosure of the Spalding mortgage, if he had been a purchaser of Camber\u2019s Island from P. M. Nightingale ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b211-9\">As a general proposition, the rights and liens of mortgagees are not affected if they .are not made parties-to foreclosure proceedings in the suit of another mortgagee. 2 Hilliard on Mortgages, 156, \u00a7 51 <em>et seq. </em>There is no question in the case of attacking a judgment collaterally. The questions are: 1, Fraud, which renders void all judgments, &amp;c., Code of Georgia, \u00a7\u00a7 1945 to 1947, 3178, 3595, 3596; and, 2, superiority of lien by reason of the absolute bar of the Spalding mortgage.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b211-10\">3. And where a prior mortgagee is barred by the statute of hmit-ations, and is yet proceeding to foreclose without subsequent mortgagees being made parties, such subsequent mortgagees may intervene, and recover against the prior mortgagee. 2 Hilliard on Mortgages, 160, note (a). <em>Lord </em>v. Morris, 18 Cal. 482. (Decided by Mr. Justice Field.) <em>Gates </em>v. <em>Lilly, </em>81 Nor. Car. 643. It has been shown that under statutory foreclosure in Georgia the subsequent mortgagee had no right to intervene. In California, as in Georgia,, a mortgage is only a security for a debt. Yet a mortgage in Georgia is a <em>deed </em>of a claim, a right, a demand. <em>Calloway </em>v. <em>Peoples' Bank, </em>54 Geo. 441, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>447, 448; <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Lathrop, </em>46 Ga. 133, 137; <em>Lane </em>v. <em>Partee, </em>41 Geo. 202, 207. In this last case the court says: \u201c A <em>Iona fide </em>mortgagee, to the extent of his interest in the land mortgaged, stands upon the same footing as any other <em>bona-fide </em>purchaser,\u201d &amp;c. This is just the' doctrine laid down in <em>Lord </em>v. <em>Morris. </em>So, in Georgia as in California, the statute applies to <em>\u201c </em>actions at law as well as suits in equity.\u201d 18 Cal. 486; Code of Georgia, 2924, Acts of 1869, p. 133.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b212-4\">4. The decree of the court below, if valid, establishes the doctrine that the mortgagor^ P. M. Nightingale, could by his failure to plead the bar of the statute of 1869, that is, \u201c by his acts, confessions or neglect,\u201d be able to defeat the mortgage lien of appellant in favor of his own family, who, by the law, was precluded from setting up that statute. This principle is ably combated by Judge McCay himself, in his high and palmy days, when he was one of the most distinguished .judges the .Supreme Court of Georgia ever had, in <em>Williams </em>v. Terrell, 54 Geo. 463.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b212-5\">5.

The first of these may be said to be this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>plea of\u2018 the statute of limitations; the second, the question of actual fraud in the foreclosure of the Spalding mortgage, and the transfer of title thereby to the children of Phineas M. Nightingale.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">As regards the statute, of limitations, it is observable that the foreclosure suit was brought in &lt; the name of Spalding, the original mortgagee, for the use of Johnston, administrator of the estate of Molyneux, for reasons explained by the attorneys who brought it. The' suit was against Phineas M. Nightingale himself, who lived until the whole proceeding was ended and the property sold, and who died a few months afterwards. The proper, if not the only, 'time and place that this statute of limitations could have been pleaded was in that suit. Nightingale himself, who was the d\u00e9btor and was in possession and had no equitable defence against the debt for which a judgment at law had been already obtained against him in one of the courts of Georgia, did not plead the statute of limitations. It would hardly be insisted by anybody that-he was under any personal, legal or moral obligation to plead that statute. He had obtained from Mrs. Molyneux a very favorable settlement-of a debt of over one hundred thousand dollars. Dunginess, which was accepted at the price of $25,000, is stated in the oral testimony to have been sold not long afterwards for $15,000. The value of the slaves was. adjusted on* some fair basis, and corresponding deduction was made on that account, so that the sum of $51,250, which was yet due on the mortgage, was in every sense an honorable and just debt which Nightingale owed to the estate of Molyneux, and a plea of the statute of limitations to that debt, if it could have been sustained after the payments-made upon it, within the period of limitation, would have been an unjust exercise of Nis right to make such a plea which could only result in favor of the plaintiff Sanger.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">The right to plead the statute of limitations has been always held to be a personal privilege, of which the debtor could avail himself or not, as he might choose. See <em>Pitman's Administratrix </em>v. <em>Elder et al. </em>in the Supreme Court of Georgia,. March Term, 1886.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>It is true there are some authorities which go to show that a purchaser with the legal title, whose right'accrued subsequent to the debt which may be barred by the statute, can also avail himself of the statute when he is sued to foreclose this equity of redemption. While this proposition is not undisputed, the cases in which this privilege has been sustained by the courts of Georgia are those in which the party setting it up has become the owner of the title or the entire equity of redemption, or has been found in possession of the mortgaged property.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">And in the case of <em>Ewell </em>v. Daggs, 108 U. S. 143, this court said that, though the subsequent purchaser might set up the plea of the statute, the plea must show that the action is barred as <em>belmeen the parties to the </em>debt, because as the owner of the equity of redemption it is <em>that </em>debt he has to pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">The statute of limitations applicable to this case is \u00a7 6 of the act of March 16, 1869, Pamph. Laws Geo. 1869, p. 133, which reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-6\">\u201c That all other actions upon contracts, express or implied, or upon any debt or liability whatsoever to the public, or a corporation, or a private individual or individuals, which accrued prior to 1st June, 1865, and are not now barred, shall be brought by 1st January, 1870, or both the right and right of action to enforce it shall be forever barred.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">This being a law of the state of Georgia, we must follow its construction by the courts of that state, so far as it has been construed. It is said in the argument in this case, but not much insisted upon by the plaintiffs, that this is a peremptory discharge of the debt, and is not a mere statute of limitations, which, to be available, must be pleaded, as is the case with other limitation acts. The proposition is, that the statute in effect destroys the right of action, but this doctrine has been overruled repeatedly by the Supreme Court of Georgia, in which it has been held to be an ordinary statute of limitations. See <em>George </em>v. <em>Gardner, </em>49 Geo. 441, 449; <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Gray, </em>49 Geo. 585. In <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Irvin, </em>47 Geo. 405, it was decided that the pleading of the statute was only a personal privilege of the debtor, and that to avail himself of the stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>ute he must plead it. See also <em>Baker and wife </em>v. <em>Bush, </em>25 Geo. 594</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">The mortgagee of real estate in Georgia does not take the title to the property. The mortgage is only a security for the debt for which it is made. The title remains in the mortgagor. The cases in that state, as already intimated, go no further than to hold that a purchaser of the legal title, or possibly a .mortgagee in possession, may,-when sued, plead the' statute of limitations as a defence to a prior debt, or mortgage, or incumbrance, made by the holder of the legal title.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">In the case before us Sanger never had the possession, never had the legal title, and, as he was no party to the foreclosure proceedings, which he now contests, he simply stands upon such rights as his mortgage lien gives him against Nightingale. It is difficult to see from what standpoint he, in this suit, in which he is complainant, seeking to foreclose his own mortgage, can set up the statute of limitations, not as a defence, for he is not sued and nobody is troubling him about his claim, but as a positive weapon to set aside and annul in this collateral proceeding the decree of a court of competent jurisdiction, with proper parties before it, which foreclosed a mortgage prior in time and equal in equity to his, under which the property was sold and passed into other hands. Certainly the court which rendered that decree had jurisdiction of the property and of Nightingale, the defendant, who was in possession, and who had the legal title. It is equally as certain that whether Nightingale ought to have pleaded the statute or not, he diet not do so, and it is now too late to set it up as a defence to that suit. If Nightingale himself had made that plea, it is difficult to perceive how he could have avoided the effect of part payment by the transfer -of Dunginess and an acknowledgment of the debt by the settlement under which it was adjusted at $51,250, as a sufficient answer to the plea of the \"statute of limitations. \"We suppose, though no authorities are cited on the subject, that the law of Georgia, like that of other' states, admits of such evidence as payment, acknowledgment of the debt, and agreement to pay, as being a sufficient reply to the statute of limitations. How Nightingale <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>could have pleaded the statute successfully under such circumstances we do not see. In short, we see no way, in accordance with any known principles of dealing with the statute of limitations, that the plaintiff can,, in this collateral proceeding, make use of the statute as a positive weapon of attack to set aside a decree rendered by' a court of competent jurisdiction, with proper parties before it, under which the title has passed by \u00e1 judicial sale to third persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">In regard to the other proposition, that the whole proceeding was the result of a fraudulent combination to cut off and defeat the claim of the plaintiff, we have a little more difficulty.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">There are many circumstances of suspicion in the transaction. There is no very satisfactory account of anything being paid by the Nightingales for the purchase of Camber\u2019s Island under that decree of foreclosure. There is no very clear account of how the bonds and mortgage, under which that decree was made, came into the possession of William Nightingale and his brothers and sisters. When the purchase was made, William Nightingale gave his note for $30,000, payable to the order of the attorneys who foreclosed the mortgage. It is nowhere shown that this note was ever paid. It is not claimed that it was ever paid in fact; nor is it shown what became of it. It is stated by the attorneys that the mortgage was foreclosed in the name of Spalding, for the use of George H. Johnston, administrator of Edward Molyneux, and that the note for the purchase money was taken to the solicitors as a means of distributing it to those who might be entitled to it. The attorneys seem to have been satisfied that the transfer of the original mortgage and bonds to the Nightingales, the children of Phineas M. Nightingale, extinguished this note, and if there were any clear and satisfactory account of how the junior Nightingales became possessed of the bonds and mortgage this might explain .the whole matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">The attempt to do this is rather a lame affair. It is said that the title of Phineas M. Nightingale to D\u00fcnginess was brought into doubt by an examination of some papers under which he held it, which raised a question whether he had any<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>thing more than a life estate in that property, the title of which after his 'death descended to his children, and, therefore, Mrs. Molyneux would have no title to Dunginess when he died. A paper is produced which professes to.be a quitclaim- conveyance by the children of Nightingale to Mrs. Molyneux. This conveyance is set up as the consideration on which Mrs. Molyneux, or the administrator of her husband\u2019s estate, transferred the remaining part of the debt due on the original mortgage to the children of Phineas M. Nightingale.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">But it must be confessed that the whole of this proposition is involved in obscurity. Where this paper came from, whether it was ever delivered to anybody, or how it came, to be executed, are questions- which are wholly unexplained by any part of the paper or by anybody who seems to know anything about' it. If the other defences to the charges of fraud and conspiracy in the foreclosure of the Spalding mortgage and the purchase of the.estate were not better sustained than this, we should be very much inclined to reverse the decree on that branch of the subject. But it is very clear that the settlement and adjustment by which the elder Nightingale conveyed Dunginess at a consideration of $25,000 to Mrs. Molyneux, and by which an adjustment was at the same time made of the claim for the failure of consideration by reason of the emancipation of the slaves, and the sum of $51,250 found to be due and unpaid on the mortgage, was a fair and honest transaction; nor is anything to be found which impeaches .the proceedings for the foreclosure of the mortgage for the remainder of the debt. The proceedings in this case were fair and open and according to the laws of the state of Georgia. Nothing hindered the attorneys who conducted these proceedings from accepting William\u2019s note for $30,000 as a proper consideration for the purchase money and for the sheriff\u2019s deed, which was made to him. It is nowhere asserted that the property was worth more than this $30,000. Up to this point there is no reason to complain of any improper exercise' of power on the part of the owners of the mortgage, or of the conduct and proceedings for its foreclosure in the courts of Georgia.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">Now, whatever arrangement may' have afterwards been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>made between Mrs. Molyneux, or the administrator of the Molyneux estate, and the Nightingales, by which this note was either satisfied by the quitclaim conveyances referred to of Dunginess, or was absolutely remitted as a gratuity to the children of the senior Nightingale, is a matter of which Sanger had no right to complain. The debt ivas a just debt. The decre\u00e9 was an honest decree, and the proceeds of it belonged to the estate of Molyneux, either to the widow, the administrator, or devisees, if there was a will.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">It is stated here, and it seems the most probable solution of the' matter, that in addition to this quitclaim of the heirs of Nightingale of Dunginess, that Mrs. Molyneux, 'who was the principal if not the sole devisee under her husband\u2019s will, had become attached to the family of the Nightingales while she resided in this country, and was willing that the debt due to her should be used as a ineans of securing to the children the family homestead. She had a right to do this. It was her property. She had the right to select whether she would give it to Sanger or to these children. In no event, that we can see, was Sanger injured by the transaction.
