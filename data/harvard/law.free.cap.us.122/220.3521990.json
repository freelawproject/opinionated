We enclose a statement showing figures, as near as we' can give them, of your indebtedness to Mr. Sibley and to ourselves, growing out of that transaction. -To Mr. Sibley you will owe $14,364; to us $1292.46. And Mr. Sibley will have to transfer to you, upon the payment of the aggregate amount, say $15,656.46, $75,000 of Southern Railway Security stock. That amount of that stock cannot be sold-now to-realize as much as $15,000, but it is said that it is intrinsically worth 25 cents in the dollar.

There is no use of a suit; all can be settled without.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b255-7\">Simonton died in 1876, and this bill was filed March 5, 1877.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b255-8\">The account rendered by Sibley to Simonton as aforesaid was adopted by th.e master as the true statement of accounts between them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b255-9\">The defendant excepted to the master\u2019s report, \u201c in that he did not charge the complainant, Hiram Sibley, with $100,000 of Southern Eailway Security stock, with interest at seven per cent, which the evidence shows the said Sibley received as cash at par value.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b255-10\">The Circuit Court overruled this exception and confirmed the master\u2019s report, and. afterwards, upon the report of a special master showing that Simonton\u2019s estate was insolvent, entered a final decree in favor of Sibley for the sum of $5191.35.

It is further agreed that Hiram Sibley may, if deemed best by him, proceed to foreclose the mortgage securing said bonds, and to that end may employ counsel, the charge for which shall be borne by the parties in interest, in proportion to the amount of bonds and stock held by each; and whatever the proceeds of said foreclosure may be, or, if the bonds are sold, whatever the net proceeds of the sale may be, after paying the said sums of money and expenses of foreclosure, they shall be considered as due to each party in proportion as the bonds and stock are now held, but may be held by Hiram Sibley as coEateral security for the payment of the aforesaid sums respectively.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b256-6\">By \u201c the said sums of money \u201d in the above passage is meant the sums due by Simonton and Lancaster, Brown <em>&amp; </em>Co., for, as wiE appear by a former part of the agreement, that very expression is used in reference to these debts just after their specification. This remark may be <em>ex aiundanti, </em>as the fact appears plain even without such context.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b256-7\">It .is submitted that Sibley was to seE at any time (whether before or after these debts became payable) \u2014 \u201cat any time,\u201d that is, before or after March 14, 1873 \u2014 and that having perfect discretion as to, the sale, he was bound to apply the pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>ceeds to his debt, so far as needed, and the balance amongst the parties in proportion. As already intimated, the. word \u201c apply,\u201d in the. agreement of June 19, 1872, is to be referred to the word \u201c shall \u201d in the first line (\u201c shall have, &amp;c., and [shall] apply\u201d); whilst, if the writers had intended to connect it with the word \u201c privilege,\u201d in the second line, they would have made it \u201c applying.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b257-5\">He did sell, but after holding certain proceeds for more than two years he asserts an option to turn these over to the firm, and without more said to require his partners or debtors to make good to him any loss that his holding of them might have occasioned. \u00a1By what authority is this done <em>%</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b257-6\">The agreement of 19th June, 1872, (the only material one upon Sibley\u2019s theory of a loss by him, \u2014 as that of the 20th is important only in case the adventure turned out to be profitable,) creates a partnership in a property already held as collateral\u2014 a partnership, that is, in an anticipated profit after a creditor, (Sibley,) who was also to be a partner, should have, been satisfied. In the'meantime that creditor-partner was-to hold the property, with privilege to sell, and duty thereupon to pay himself. If he should sell, the partnership had no power to control the proceeds before the satisfaction of his debt, and even he had no power over them as partner. The agreement is that the proceeds of any sale be applied to the debt.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b257-7\">It is submitted that Sibley sold in his character as creditor.

Sibley never received any money from this stock, except one cash dividend of $3500.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">The master has treated this 'stock as partnership property, and has charged Simonton\u2019s- estate with his aforesaid debt to Sibley of $135,633, and interest, and credited him with $136,-750, half of the sums^received ,by Sibley in cash as aforesaid, showing, with' the interest and expense \u00e1ecount, a balance due Sibley of something more than $14,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">The argument. of the -appellant, that Sibley should have been charged with,,^\u00a3'.$100,9.00 of stock of the Southern Railway Security Company at 'its par value, is based upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>theory that Sibley, in selling the partnership property, acted, and was authorized to act, only as a creditor of his copartners, and not as a partner on behalf of the partnership.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">It cannot be denied that some of the provisions of the original agreement of partnership are consistent with this theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">The agreement provides that Sibley \u201c shall have the privilege of selling the whole amount of both, bonds and stock at his discretion at any time, and apply the proceeds to the payment of the said sums due to him.\u201d If this were all-, there might be some difficulty in construing Sibley\u2019s authority to sell as absolute and unqualified; and his \u201cprivilege of selling \u201d might perhaps be considered as so coupled with a duty to \u201c apply the proceeds \u201d of any sale \u201c to the payment of the said sums due to him,\u201d that he would be bound, if he sold the property, to apply the proceeds at once to the payment of those sums.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">The agreement of June 19 next provides that Sibley may, if he .thinks best, proceed to foreclose the mortgage by which the bonds were secured, \u201c and whatever the proceeds of said foreclosure may be, or, if' the bonds are sold, whatever the net proceeds of' the sale may be, after paying the said sums of money and expenses of foreclosure, they shall be considered as due to each party in proportion as the bonds and stock are now held.\u201d This provision, again, if it had stopped here, might possibly have been understood as intended only to affirm the right of the partners to share, according to their respective interests, in the proceeds of either a foreclosure or a sale \u2014 the debt to Sibley, as well as the incidental expenses, being first paid out of those proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">But this provision goes on and ends with these words: \u201c but may be held by Hiram Sibley as collateral security for the payment of the aforesaid sums respectively.\u201d This clause, taken in connection with what goes before, cannot possiblv mean that it is only the net proceeds, after deducting out of them the sums due to Sibley from his copartners, together with the incidental expenses, in the event of a foreclosure, or after deducting the sums due him from his copartners in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>event of a sale, that are to be. held by him \u201cas collateral security for the payment of the aforesaid sums respectively; \u201d for, after an application of the proceeds of' a sale to the payment of those sums, either those sums would have been wholly paid if the proceeds were sufficient to pay them, or, if they were insufficient, no proceeds would remain t\u00f3 be held as collateral security. The only reasonable construction of the clause is, that Sibley, instead of immediately applying the proceeds, either of a sale \u00f3r of a foreclosure, to the payment of the debts of his copartners to himself, may hold the whole proceeds, just as he previously' held the bonds and stock, as collateral security for the payment of those debts, leaving the title to the proceeds after the sale or foreclosure, as the title to the bonds and stock was before, in the partners 'respectively, in the proportions determined by the partnership agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">The supplemental agreement of June 20, 1872, also, making special provisions for the distribution of \u201c any profits arising from the sale, foreclosure, or any other disposition of said bonds,\u201d clearly implies, by the use of the word \u201c profits,\u201d that any sale by Sibley might be made by him as a partner on behalf of the partnership, and not merely as a creditor enforcing his collateral security.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">The view that the partnership agreement empowered Sibley to sell the property as managing partner, independently of his right as a creditor, is confirmed by the terms of the power of attorney given him by his copartners on October 3, 1874, by which they recited that they had \u201c heretofore left to him the management of the adventure,\u201d and authorized and requested him, either to prosecute the proceedings for foreclosure, \u201c or to take such other action, by sale of bonds or otherwise, as may in his judgment appear for the best interest of all concerned.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">The Southern Bail way Security Company stock is now worthless; and it is not proved, nor even contended, that Sibley neglected any opportunity of selling it and turning it into money. The only exception to the master\u2019s report, relied on at the argument, was that the master had not charged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>Sibley with this stock at its par value, and interest. Upon the true construction of the partnership agreement, and the proofs in the case,' this exception was rightly overruled by the Circuit Court, because this stock was never received by Sibley as cash, or accepted by him as his own property in part payment of the sums due him from the other partners, but was received and afterwards held by him as property of the partnership, belonging to all the partners in the proportions stipulated in the original agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">The further objection has been taken for the first time in this court, that the bill cannot be maintained, because the evidence shows an- account stated between Sibley and Simon-ton, on which an action at law would lie. It is a sufficient answer to this objection, that the evidence does not show, and the master has not found, that an account was rendered by the one party and assented to by the other, but only that Sibley rendered to Simonton a statement of the account between them, which was not treated by either as an account stated, nor ever agreed to or settled, but remained open at the death of Simonton, and until its truth was established by the evidence in this suit against his executrix to settle the accounts of the partnership. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
