To this answer a .replication was filed, and the case was submitted to a jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b339-5\">On the trial, as appeared by a bill of exceptions duly taken, the relat'or offered to read in evidence the petition, summons, marshal\u2019s return, and judgment referred to in the information. On objection made by the respondents, the court ruled that these papers could not be. read unless the relator would also read\" the bonds filed with said petition, to which ruling the relator excepted. The relator then put in evidence the said papers and also the said- bonds.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b339-6\">The petition in the original action set out, \u201cthat on the 9th day. of June, 1867, defendant subscribed to the capital stock of the Missouri and Mississippi Bailroad Company, a railroad company duly organized under the laws of this state, the sum of one hundred thousand dollars; that said subscription was authorized by a vote of the people of said county, of Knox at a special election held pursuant to an order-of the county court of said county on the 12th'day of March, 1867, under the 17th section of c.- 63 of the General Statutes of Missouri of. 1866, then in force; that at said election two-thirds of the qualified voters of said county voted in favor of and assented to the making of said subscription; that in- part payment of said- subscription defendant, by its county court, executed and issued divers bonds with coupons for interest attached; that by each of said bonds defendants promised to pay to bearer, at the National Bank of Commerce, in the city of New York, on the first day of February, 1878, the sum of five hundred dollars, with interest at the rate of seven per cent per annum; that said coupons for interest were made and are payable on the first day of February of each year between the issuing of said bonds and the maturity' thereof; that by each of said coupons defendant promised to pay bearer the sum of thirty-five dollars, being one year\u2019s interest on the bond to* which it was attached. That, in further payment in part of said subscription, defendant executed and issued divers other bonds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>with coupons for interest attached \u2022 that by each of said bonds defendant promised to pay to bearer, at the National Bank of Commerce, in the city of New York, on the first day of February, 1880, the sum of five hundred dollars, with int\u00e9rest at the rate of seven per cent per annum; that said coupons for interest were made payable on the first day of February of each year, between the issuing of said bonds and the maturity thereof; that by each of said coupons defendant promised to pay to bearer the sum of thirty-five dollars, being one year\u2019s interest on the bond to which it was attached.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b340-5\">The petition also set out that the plaintiff was the bearer and owner of divers of said bonds and coupons, designated by numbers. The return of the summons showed that the writ was duly served, and judgment was rendered thereon March 28, 1881, by default, which set forth that \u201c this action being founded upon certain bonds and coupons for interest thereon, issued by said defendant, and described in the petition, the court finds that the plaintiff has sustained damages by reason of the non-payment thereof in the sum of $77,374.46. It is, therefore, considered by the court, that the plaintiff, George W.

Was the subscription to stock to the railroad com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>pany actually made, not, as recited in said bonds, under the charter of the Missouri &amp; Mississippi Railroad Co., but under the general law, whereby the authority to make such subscription and issue bonds therefor was dependent on the vote of the people; in other words, has the relator proved that, despite the recitals in the 'bonds, they were not issued as recited, but under the gen\u00e9ral law, and that said recitals in the bonds were made through mistake or' inadvertence.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b341-5\">At the conclusion of the evidence the court instructed the jury, \u201cthat to overcome the recitals in the bonds issued by the county court under its seal, the evidence must be clear and positive, full and explicit, and that the burden of proving the alleged mistake, so as to overthrow the said recitals, is upon the relator in this case,\u201d and \u201c that the evidence to overcome said recitals is insufficient.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b341-6\">In answer to these questions, the jury found in the affirmative on the first, and in the negative on the second; and thereupon the court entered a judgment in favor of the respondents, in which it was recited that it appeared to the court \u201c that there was an election held under orders of the county court of Knox County, and that two-thirds of the qualified voters voting at said election cast their votes in favor of the subscription by the said court to the stock mentipned in its orders, but that the subscription to the stock of the Missouri and Mississippi Railroad Company was actually made and the bonds issued, not as alleged in the petition and alternative writ in this case, under the general law of the state of Missouri, but solely under and by virtue of an act of the General Assembly of the state of Missouri, entitled ' An act to incorporate the.

Thrasher, 6 How. <em>44. </em>The defendants were neither parties nor privies to the judgment which the relator recovered against Knox County. They had no' right to call witnesses to testify in their favor, to cross-examine the witnesses introduced by the opposite side; to control the defence, or to sue out a writ of error. As they were not parties to said judgment, they* are not estopped from showing that the allegations in the relator\u2019s petition, upon which he recovered said judgment by default, are false. <em>Hale </em>v. <em>Finch, </em>104 U.

' It has already been shown that th\u00e9 county court of Knox County had no authority or power to subscribe to the capital stock of the Missouri <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>and Mississippi Railroad Company under the General. Statutes of Missouri without the assent of two-thirds of the qualified voters of the county. And if the county court had put such a recital into the bonds, it could not by such false recital create an obligation to levy a tax under the General Statutes, and thereby estop the defendants from showing that the subscription was made and the bonds issued under the charter of the Missouri and Mississippi Railroad Company. Bights cannot be created and duties imposed by false recitals, where there is a total want of power. <em>Carroll County </em>v. Smith, 111 U.

This is the practice in courts of equity where a complainant seeks the means of carrying into effect a decree or judgment rendered in another litigation between the same parties, or parties claiming under them when the decree or judgment does not provide the means of execution. In such case the court will look into the original cause of action and ascertain whether the complainant is entitled to have the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>aid him in carrying into effect the original decree or judgment.

S. 582. As the limit of taxation prescribed and permitted under \u00a7 13 of the act incorporating the Missouri and Mississippi Railroad Company, to be levied in payment of bonds issued thereunder, was not to exceed one-twentieth of one per cent upon -the assessed value of the taxable property for each year, the contention of the respondents, in the Circuit Court was, that they were entitled to show by the recitals in the bonds themselves, in contradiction to those contained in the judgment founded upon them, that they were in fact issued under the charter of the corporation, and not under the general law. On this point, the judgment of the Circuit Court was in their favor, denying \u2019to the relator the peremptory writ of mandamus, and this decision is now alleged as error, for which the judgment should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">The question is, whether the respondents below are estopped in this proceeding by the judgment in favor of the relator against the county of Knox on the bonds, to deny that the bonds were issued in pursuance of '\u00a7 17, c. 63, of the General Statutes of Missouri of.-1866. The averment to that effect in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>the petition in the action, if material and traversable, was confessed by the default. The judgment recites that the action is founded upon certain bonds and coupons for interest thereon issued by said defendant and described in the petition. The averment as to the character of the bonds, and the grounds and authority upon which they were founded, so as to constitute them legal obligations of the county of Knox, contained in the petition, was clearly material to the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action. If the defendant had denied it by a proper pleading, the fact would haye been put in issue, and the plaintiff would have been bound to prove it.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">It was part of the plaintiff\u2019s case to show, not merely the execution of the bonds by the county authorities, but that they were issued in pursuance of a law making them the valid obligations of the county. The power to issue such securities does not inhere in a municipal corporation, so as to be implied from its corporate existence; it must be conferred, either in express words, or by reasonable intendment; and if the authority to issue them in a given case is challenged by a proper denial, the plaintiff is put to the proof. \u2022 \"What it is necessary for him to prove, it is proper for him to allege, and the allegation must be proven as made. It follows, therefore, that if a denial had been made in the action on the bonds in question, the averment that they were issued under \u00a7 17, c. 63, of the General Statutes of Missouri of 1866, would have been material and traversable, and proof of the fact would have been necessary to support the recovery. In the absence of a denial, the fact as stated in the petition of' the plaintiff is confessed by the default, and stands as an admission on the record, of its truth by the defendant. It is quite true that the judgment would have beefl the same whether the authority to issue the bonds was derived under the general statutes or under the charter of the railroad company, but good pleading required that the fact, whichever way it was, should be stated, and when stated the averment must be proved as laid.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">As this is a direct proceeding upon the judgment, its effect as an estoppel is determined by the first branch of the rule as laid down in <em>Cromwell </em>v. <em>County of Sac, </em>91 U. S. 351, 352. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>That is: \u201c It is a finality as to the claim or demand in controversy, concluding parties and those in privity with them, not \u2019 only as to every matter which was offered and received to sustain or defeat the claim or demand, but as to any other admissible matter which might have been offered for that purpose.\u201d And as stated in <em>Burlen </em>v. Shannon, 99 Mass. 200, 203, \u201cThe estoppel is not confined to the judgment, but extends to all facts involved in it, as necessary steps or the groundwork upon which it must have been founded.\u201d It is \u2022 none the less conclusive because rendered by default. \u201c The conclusiveness of a judgment upon the rights of the parties does in nowise depend upon its form or upon the fact that the court investigated or decided the legal principles involved; a judgment by default or upon confession is in its nature just as conclusive iipon the rights of the parties before the court as a judgment upon a demurrer or verdict.\u201d <em>Gifford </em>v. <em>Thorn, </em>9 N. J. Eq. (18 Stockton) 702, 722. The bar is all the more perfect and complete in this proceeding because it is not a new action. Mandamus, as it has been repeatedly decided by this court, in such cases as the present, is a remedy in the nature of an execution for the purppse of collecting the judgment. <em>Riggs </em>v. <em>Johnson County, </em>6 Wall. 166; <em>Supervisors </em>v. <em>Durant, </em>9 Wall. 415; <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>103 U. S. 480, 484. Certainly nothing that contradicts the record of the' judgment can be alleged in a proceeding at law for its collection by execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">' In <em>Balls County </em>v. <em>United States, </em>105 U. S. 733,734, the Chief Justice said: \u201c In the return to the alternative writ many defences were set up which related to the validity of the coupons on which the judgment had been obtained, as obligations of the county. As to these defences, it is sufficient to say it was conclusively settled by the judgment, which lies at the foundation of the present suit, that the coupons were binding obligations of the county, duly created under the authority of the charter of the railroad company, and as such entitled to payment out of any fund that could lawfully be raised for that purpose. It has been in effect so decided by the Supreme Court of Missouri in <em>State </em>v. <em>Bainey, </em>74 Missouri, 229, and the principle on which the decision rests is elementarv.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>As the execution follows the nature of the judgment, and its precept is to carry into effect the rights of the plaintiff as declared by the judgment, with that mode and measure of redress which in such cases the law gives, so the mandamus in a case like the present can be limited in its mandate only by that which the judgment itself declares.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">It was said, however, in <em>Ralls County </em>v. <em>The United </em>States, 105 U. S., 733, 735, that \u201c while the coupons are merged in the judgment, they carry with them into the judgment all the remedies which in law formed a part of their contract obligations, and these remedies may still be enforced in all appropriate ways, notwithstanding the change in the form of the debt.\u201d It is argued from this, that, as the remedies to be resorted to for the purpose of enforcing the judgment are those given by the original contract, it is necessary to ascertain from the contract itself what those remedies are; but that is the very matter which has been already passed upon in the judgment, which decides, in the present case, by its recital, the character and extent of the obligation created by the law of the contract. It may well be that in a case where the record of the judgment is silent on the point, the original contract may be shown, notwithstanding the merger, to determine the extent of the remedy provided by the law for its enforcement; but that is not admissible where, as in this case, the matter has been adjudged in the original action. Indeed, in view of the nature of the remedy by mandamus, as the means of executing the judgment, it is all the more material and important that the judgment itself should determine the nature of the contract and the extent of its obligation. The averment in the original petition that the bonds were issued under the authority of a particular statute becomes, therefore, an additional element in the plaintiff\u2019s case in that action for the purpose of showing with certainty what is the mode and measure of redress after judgment. By the terms of the judgment in favor of the relator it was determined that the bonds sued on were issued under the authority of a statute which prescribed no limit to the rate of taxation for their payment. In such cases, the law which authorizes the issue of the bonds gives also the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>\u2019 means of payment by taxation. The findings in the judgment on that point are conclusive. They bind the respondents in their oificial capacity, as well as the county itself, because, as was said in <em>Labette County Commissioners </em>v. Moulton, 112 U. S. 217, they are \u201cthe legal representatives of the defendant in that judgment, as being the parties on whom the law .has cast the duty of providing for its satisfaction. They are not 'Strangers to it as being new parties on whom an original obligation is sought to be charged, but are bound by it as it stands without the right to question it, and under a legal duty to take those steps which the law has prescribed as the only mode of providing means for its payment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">The return of the respondents, therefore, to the alternative writ of mandamus is insuificient in law, and the Circuit Court erred in not awarding to the relator a peremptory writ of mandamus. For that error</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\"><em>The judgment is </em>reversed, <em>and the cause </em>remanded, <em>with directions to a/ward a peremptory ma/ndamus.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
