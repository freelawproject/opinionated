(DFS). We affirm the judgment in favor of respondent Duggan\u2019s Serra Mortuary, Inc. (Serra) as well as the award of attorney fees, as modified.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-11\">I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b125-12\">A. <em>History of the Two Companies</em></p>\n<p id=\"b125-13\">The history of the family funeral business dates back to the 1880\u2019s when James Hagen began providing funeral services in the Sari Francisco area. William Duggan started working for Hagen in 1903 and married his daughter, Henrietta, the next year. In 1929 William Duggan, began using the name \u201cDuggan\u2019s Funeral Service\u201d for his own business on Valencia Street in San Francisco. DFS moved to 17th Street in 1934 and has remained there ever since.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-14\">William and Henrietta had several children, including Edwin (Bud) and Letitia. Bud worked for DFS, eventually becoming president. In 1963 Bud <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>founded Serra in Daly City. The Board of Directors of DFS terminated Bud\u2019s employment that year. Bud\u2019s sister, Letitia Welch, took over the business and ran it until her death in 1977. At that time her son, William Welch, became president of DFS.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">In 1963 the then constituted State Board of Funeral Directors and Embalmers (Board)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> licensed Serra under the name \u201cDuggan\u2019s Serra Mortuary.\u201d Serra has operated and advertised under the name \u201cDuggan\u2019s Serra Mortuary\u201d since its inception. DFS has known of the use of this name, and has been familiar with Serra\u2019s various telephone book advertisements, since Serra\u2019s inception.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">As can be expected, conflicts arose within the Duggan family related to that critical juncture in 1963 when Bud Duggan split off from DFS and started his own mortuary business. At a special meeting convened in May 1963, the DFS Board of Directors<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> agreed (1) to set up an arbitration board \u201cto decide differences between various factions in the corporation\u201d; (2) that all telephone calls coming to DFS regarding a death would be considered DFS business, \u201cno matter to whom the call was directed\u201d; and (3) copies of all proposed classified ads by DFS and Serra would be submitted to the arbitration board \u201cimmediately, for decision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">Three outsiders were appointed to the arbitration board, including O\u2019Gara, DFS\u2019s attorney at the time, and Clecak, Bud Duggan\u2019s attorney. In June 1963 O\u2019Gara wrote to Bud Duggan: \u201cAt a recent meeting of the Board of Directors in connection with the Duggan sign which you acquired from the Duggan\u2019s Funeral Service, you will recall that you agreed to immediately alter this sign to show that the name of your establishment was not \u2018Duggan\u2019s\u2019 as the sign indicates, but Duggan\u2019s Seira Mortuary. . . . [H] The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>Duggan\u2019s Funeral Service name and the use of the word \u2018Duggan\u2019s\u2019 connected therewith, are an important asset of the Duggan\u2019s Funeral Service corporation. . . . [A]t the next Board of Directors meeting, the Board is going to consider the question of taking legal steps ... to prevent continued confusion in the eyes of the public of the use of the word \u2018Duggan\u2019s\u2019 alone in your Duggan\u2019s Serra Mortuary operation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">In July 1963 O\u2019Gara proceeded to review telephone directory ads and listings for both companies. In correspondence to Letitia Welch, O\u2019Gara suggested that there should be a meeting to make agreed revisions \u201cso that there will be no confusion in the minds of the readers . . . that the Duggan\u2019s Serra Mortuary is owned by Mr. and Mrs. Edwin J. Duggan, and that the Duggan\u2019s Funeral Service is a separate entity.\u201d Thereafter O\u2019Gara forwarded to the telephone company the ad and listing copy that DFS and Serra would run. Each ad and listing used the name \u201cDuggan\u2019s.\u201d The letter enclosing the Serra ad copy stated: \u201cWe are sending this at the direction of Edwin J. (Bud) Duggan, President, since we are coordinating his listing with the listing of Duggan\u2019s Funeral Service.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">In his deposition, William Welch stated that although immediate family members expressed dissatisfaction with Bud for using the Duggan name in his business, no action was taken by the DFS board to prohibit the use because the controlling interest at the time rested outside the family.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">B. <em>1993 Dispute</em></p>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">In 1993 Steven Welch, son of William Welch, tried to open a mortuary operation in Colma, approximately just more than a mile from the Serra establishment. He applied to the Board for a license to operate under the name \u201cDuggan\u2019s Colma Funeral Shoppe.\u201d Serra objected to the Board, arguing that use of the name would be confusing to consumers, given the similarity of the two names and their close proximity. After a public hearing, the Board approved of the name \u201cColma Funeral Shop\u201d\u2014that is, \u201cDuggan\u2019s\u201d had to be omitted from the name.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-9\">C. <em>Federal Trademark Registration</em></p>\n<p id=\"b127-10\">Several days later, DFS applied to the United States Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) to register \u201cDuggan\u2019s\u201d as a federal trademark. William Welch\u2019s declaration accompanied the application. Therein he declared that to the best of his knowledge, \u201cno other person, firm, corporation, or association has the right to use the above-identified mark in commerce . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b127-11\">Initially, the PTO refused to register the mark because the term \u201cis primarily merely a surname.\u201d Welch submitted a second declaration asserting that \u201c[sjome members of the family have left the family business . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>and use the mark for funeral services without permission from applicant. Those members of the family do not have the right to use the mark within the meaning of the trademark laws. Applicant has the exclusive right to use the mark and has done so for the five years before the date of this application.\u201d With that, the PTO registered \u201cDuggan\u2019s\u201d as a service mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">Thereafter, DPS notified Serra of the registrations, demanded that Serra either \u201ctake a license to use the trademark or else stop using it\u201d and sent Serra a draft complaint for trademark infringement. Faced with this threat, Serra initiated an administrative proceeding with the PTO to cancel the registration.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">D. <em>State Court Proceedings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">In May 1997 DPS filed a state action for unfair business practices and injunctive relief. The gist of the complaint was that Serra had wrongfully and unfairly used the name Duggan\u2019s since 1962 and committed related acts of false and misleading advertising. Serra asserted a number of affirmative defenses, cross-complained for cancellation of trademark registration and other relief and requested suspension of the PTO cancellation proceeding. That request was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">After the trial court denied DFS\u2019s motion for preliminary injunction,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> DPS removed the cause to federal court. DPS also filed a \u201ccounterclaim\u201d in federal court for trademark infringement. However, Serra succeeded in remanding the entire case back to state court. Still hankering for a federal forum, DPS tried to certify the remand question for appeal to the Ninth Circuit. Ruling on DFS\u2019s motion for certification, the federal district court held that \u201callowing DPS to appeal this issue serves no useful purpose because the state court has jurisdiction to decide the trademark claims as well as the other claims at issue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b128-8\">Serra moved for summary judgment. The trial court issued a tentative ruling granting the motion on the trademark cancellation claim but denying it as to the unfair competition claims because triable issues of fact remained concerning the question of \u201csteer[agej\u201d of DFS\u2019s customers by Serra. Ultimately the court granted summary judgment on all claims, ruling that (1) DPS failed to exhaust its administrative remedies; (2) Serra\u2019s affirmative defenses of laches, acquiescence and estoppel barred DFS\u2019s claims; and (3) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>the trademark must be cancelled as a matter of law because of fraud. As well, the court granted Serra\u2019s motion for attorney fees, finding that the action was \u201cexceptional\u201d within the meaning of 15 United States Code section 1117(a). It awarded Serra $329,202.50 in fees plus $14,432 in costs. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">A. <em>Substantive Claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">1. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">Summary judgment in favor of a defendant is proper if (1) defendant shows that one or more elements of a cause of action cannot be established or there is a complete defense to it; and (2) plaintiff fails to meet his or her burden of showing the existence of a triable issue of material fact. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, subd. (c)(2).) Because a summary judgment motion raises only questions of law, we independently review the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. <em>(Rosse </em>v. <em>DeSoto Cab </em>Co. (1995) 34 Cal.App.4th 1047, 1050 [40 Cal.Rptr.2d 680].)</p>\n<p id=\"b129-9\">2. <em>Trademark Cancellation</em></p>\n<p id=\"AyE\">a. <em>Jurisdiction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b129-10\">Throughout these proceedings, DPS has contended that the superior court has no jurisdiction to cancel a federal trademark registration. This is not so.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-11\">The Lanham Act itself grants federal courts original jurisdiction over all claims arising under the act. (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1121(a).) As well, 28 United States Code section 1338(a) provides that federal district courts have original jurisdiction over all claims arising under any act of Congress pertaining to patents, copyrights, plant variety protection and trademark cases. But their jurisdiction is exclusive only with respect to patent, plant variety protection and copyright claims. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Thus, in cases arising under the Lanham Act, the jurisdiction of federal and state courts is concurrent. <em>(Aquatherm Industries, Inc. </em>v. <em>Fla. Power &amp; Light Co. </em>(11th Cir. 1996) 84 F.3d 1388, 1394; <em>Scientific Technology, Inc. v. Stanford Telecommunications, Inc. </em>(N.D.Cal. 1988) 9 U.S.P.Q.2d (BNA) 1566, 1567 [\u201cThese two statutes indicate that Congress did not intend to limit adjudication of trademark actions under the Lanham Act to federal courts\u201d]; 5 McCarthy on Trademarks and Unfair Competition (4th ed. 1997) \u00a7 32:1 (hereafter McCarthy).)</p>\n<p id=\"b130-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>DFS contends nonetheless that state courts do not have jurisdiction to cancel a federally registered trademark, citing 15 United States Code section 1121(b) and <em>Application of Marriott Corporation </em>(C.C.P.A. 1975) 517 F.2d 1364.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Section 1121(b) of that code provides in part: \u201cNo State or other jurisdiction of the United States or any political subdivision or any agency thereof may require alteration of a registered mark . . . .\u201d This statute is aimed at restraining the exercise of police power to alter a registered mark. <em>(Blockbuster Videos, Inc. </em>v. <em>City of Tempe </em>(9th Cir. 1998) 141 F.3d 1295, 1296 [municipality may not enforce zoning regulations that require alteration of a registered mark].) It is not a restraint on state court jurisdiction. In the words of Professor McCarthy: \u201c[S]tate courts possess powers under the [Lanham] Act identical to those of the federal courts.\u201d (5 McCarthy, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 32:1, fn. omitted.) Indeed, state courts can pass upon the validity of federal trademark registration. <em>(Brown &amp; Bigelow v. Remembrance Advertising Prod. </em>(1952) 279 A.D. 410 [110 N.Y.S.2d 441], affd. 304 N.Y. 909 [110 N.E.2d 736].)</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">b. <em>Cancellation Was Proper</em></p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">Under the Lanham Act, \u201cthe court may . . . order the cancelation of registrations . . . .\u201d (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1119.) A party may seek cancellation of a registered trademark on the basis of fraud by proving (1) a false misrepresentation of material fact; (2) the registrant\u2019s knowledge or belief that the representation is false; (3) intent to induce reliance; and (4) reasonable reliance thereon. <em>(Robi v. Five Platters, Inc. </em>(9th Cir. 1990) 918 F.2d 1439, 1444.)</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">With respect to the cancellation claim, the trial court found undisputed that DFS never used the name Duggan\u2019s alone as a mark; the use of the name Duggan\u2019s was not exclusive; and DFS\u2019s president, William Welch, was aware of these facts when he declared to the contrary before the PTO in order to obtain the federal registration. The court concluded that these were material misrepresentations mandating cancellation of the trademark.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">In his applicant declaration, submitted under penalty of perjury, Welch declared that the mark \u201cDuggan\u2019s\u201d had been used exclusively by the Duggan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>family since 1929; some family members had left the family business and were using the mark without permission; and DFS had the exclusive right to use the mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">In deposition Welch admitted that he never used the word \u201cDuggan\u2019s\u201d alone as a mark in advertising. Moreover, besides Serra, Welch testified to two independent funeral service businesses in the Bay Area that used the name Duggan\u2019s in their business\u2014Duggan\u2019s Mission Chapel (in Sonoma, started by William Duggan) and Duggan\u2019s Carlmont Chapel (in San Mateo County, started by another family member). As established by O\u2019Gara\u2019s letters, DFS impliedly consented to Serra\u2019s use of the name Duggan\u2019s. As well, DFS consented to use by Duggan\u2019s Mission Chapel and although Welch objected orally to use by Duggan\u2019s Carlmont Chapel, he never pursued the matter. Thus, DFS did not have the exclusive right to use the mark and permission had been given to others.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">DFS suggests that Welch\u2019s declarations were made in good faith but again, this is argument only. The above undisputed facts are to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">3., <em>4.</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">B., C. <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b131-9\">We affirm the judgment and award of fees, with the above modification.</p>\n<p id=\"AP9\">Hanlon, P.

(See, e.g., <em>id. </em>at former \u00a7 7601, as amended by Stats. 1994, ch. 908, \u00a7 53, repealed by its own terms Jan. 1, 1998; former \u00a7 7606, as amended by Stats. 1957, ch. 2084, \u00a7 22, p. 3705; former \u00a7 7619.2, as enacted by Stats. 1996, ch. 1151, \u00a7 7.) In 1998 the Board was eliminated and its responsibilities were vested in the Funeral Directors and Embalmers Program (Program), under the supervision and control of the Director of the Department of Consumer Affairs. (Stats. 1998, ch. 970, \u00a7\u00a7 21-42, 47-64, 67-71, 80-82, 85-91, 92-93.)</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">Unless otherwise indicated, all further statutory references are to the Business and Professions Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b126-9\">All members sitting on the DFS board in 1963, including Attorneys James O\u2019Gara, Jr., and William Clecak, are now deceased. Moreover, some of the minutes for regular monthly board meetings of DFS covering the key period in 1963, including those for June, August and September, were apparently lost or misplaced. In addition, although meetings were tape-recorded, the pertinent tapes were not located.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b128-9\">The denial was conditional in that the court ruled it would issue a limited injunction if the parties could \u201cagree on the phone book problems and possible disclaimers of affiliation</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b130-8\">DFS relies on the following language: \u201c[N]o state court has jurisdiction to determine the right to federal registration under the Lanham Act. \u00a7 21 (15 USC 1071) . . . .\u201d <em>(Application of Marriott Corporation, supra, </em>517 F.2d at p. 1369, fn. 8.) <em>Marriott </em>is inapposite. First, 15 United States Code section 1071 is not at issue here. It has to do with appeals from decisions made by the commissioner or the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board, specifying that a dissatisfied party may appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit or file a civil action. Second, <em>Marriott </em>is wrong. Nothing in 15 United States Code section 1071 indicates that the civil action must be brought only in federal court. <em>(Scientific Technology, Inc. </em>v. <em>Stanford Telecommunications, Inc., supra, </em>9 U.S.P.Q.2d at pp. 1567-1568.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b131-11\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 151.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
