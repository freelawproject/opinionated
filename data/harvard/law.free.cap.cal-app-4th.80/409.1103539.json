He was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>sentenced to state prison for a term of 15 years to life, plus 2 years for his use of a gun. Following a series of hearings at which Rosenkrantz was found \u201cunsuitable\u201d for parole, he filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in which he asked the superior court to compel the Board of Prison Terms to find him suitable for parole. Over the Board\u2019s opposition, the superior court granted Rosenkrantz\u2019s petition on the ground that there was no evidence to support the Board\u2019s findings of unsuitability. The superior court ordered the Board to hold a new hearing and later issued other orders in furtherance of the enforcement of the earlier orders. The Board of Prison Terms filed an appeal, and later filed a petition for a writ of mandate. In substance, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\"><em>The Circumstances of the Offense. </em>Robert Rosenkrantz graduated from high school on June 21, 1985. That night, he hosted a party at his parents\u2019 beach house. Rosenkrantz\u2019s brother (Joseph) and Joseph\u2019s friend (Steven Redman), acting to confirm their suspicion that Rosenkrantz was homosexual, went to the beach house, surreptitiously watched through a window for about an hour, then burst into the house, screaming \u201cfaggots\u201d and attacking Rosenkrantz and his friends. In the ensuing melee, Rosenkrantz\u2019s nose was broken. The next day, Joseph and Redman (knowing that Rosenkrantz did not want his parents to discover their son\u2019s homosexuality) told Rosenkrantz\u2019s parents that Rosenkrantz was gay. Rosenkrantz asked Joseph and Redman to tell Rosenkrantz\u2019s parents that it had all been a joke. Joseph agreed but Redman refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">Rosenkrantz\u2019s father ordered him out of the house, and Rosenkrantz slept in his car that night. He was devastated. His father hated homosexuals, and they lived in a community where gays were considered \u201cfair game,\u201d a view shared by Joseph and Redman. The next day (Monday), Rosenkrantz practiced his shooting at a firing range. He purchased an Uzi, which he picked up on Wednesday. On Thursday evening, Rosenkrantz parked in front of Red-man\u2019s residence and slept in his car. On Friday morning, when Redman came out of his house, Rosenkrantz confronted Redman, displayed the Uzi, and demanded that Redman retract the statements he had made to Rosenkrantz\u2019s parents. Redman refused, laughed, and called Rosenkrantz a \u201cfaggot.\u201d Rosenkrantz shot Redman 10 times, then drove off.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">Three weeks later, Rosenkrantz turned himself in to the police. He was charged with first degree murder. In 1986, a jury expressly acquitted him of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>first degree murder but found him guilty of second degree murder (and found true an allegation that he had personally used a firearm). Rosenkrantz was sentenced to state prison for a term of 15 years to life plus two years. We affirmed his conviction. <em>(People v. Rosenkrantz </em>(1988) 198 Cal.App.3d 1187 [244 Cal.Rptr. 403].)</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\"><em>The June 1996 Parole Suitability Proceedings. </em>Rosenkrantz was received by the Department of Corrections in 1986. His first parole hearing was held in December 1994, and his minimum parole eligibility date was fixed at January 23, 1996. (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 3040 [the Board of Prison Terms has the power to allow prisoners serving indeterminate sentences \u201cto go upon parole outside the prison walls and enclosures\u201d], 3041 [in the case of prisoners except those serving terms of life without the possibility of parole, the Board of Prison Terms \u201cshall normally set a. parole release date\u201d one year prior to the prisoner\u2019s minimum eligible parole release date].)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Rosenkrantz\u2019s next parole suitability hearing was held in June 1996, at which time the Board of Prison Terms hearing panel (Commissioners Ron Koenig and Manuel Guaderrama, and Deputy Commissioner Patricia Cassady) found Rosenkrantz <em>suitable </em>for parole and recommended a release date for the reasons set out in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>the margin.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In August, the Decision Review Unit (comprised of Commissioners Thomas Giaquinto and Arthur Van Court, and another commissioner) disapproved the recommended action for the reasons set out in the margin.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As a result, no parole date was set.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number><em>The December 1996 Parole Suitability Proceedings. </em>A rehearing was held in December 1996. At that time, the panel had before it a letter from Sergeant William P. McComas, the Sheriff\u2019s Department Homicide Bureau detective who had conducted the 1985 investigation. Excerpts from that letter, which explain the discrepancies noted by the Decision Review Unit, are set out in the margin.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Commissioner Van Court, a member of the Decision Review Unit panel that disapproved the earlier suitability recommendation based on \u201cadditional information,\u201d was a member of the rehearing panel. The other members were Commissioner John Gillis and Deputy Commissioner Mike Douglas. When Rosenkrantz\u2019s lawyer questioned the propriety of Commissioner Van Court\u2019s participation, counsel was told there was no conflict because the Decision Review Unit had not decided whether \u201cthe prisoner was suitable for parole,\u201d and had reviewed only \u201cthe administrative portion\u201d of the prior proceedings. (See \u00a7 2250 [a prisoner is entitled to a hearing by an impartial panel].) For the reasons set out in the margin, the rehearing panel found that Rosenkrantz was <em>not suitable </em>for parole.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b366-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number><em>The August 1997 Parole Suitability Proceedings. </em>Another hearing was held on August 7, 1997. The members of the panel were Commissioners Van Court, Giaquinto (who, with Van Court, had sat on the Decision Review Unit that disapproved Rosenkrantz\u2019s earlier grant of parole), and Carol Bentley. Commissioner Giaquinto presided. In addition to the information presented for the previous hearings, the August 1997 panel had before it a current recommendation for parole from Rosenkrantz\u2019s correctional counselor,* ****<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> a June 1997 \u201cPsychological Council Evaluation for the Board of Prison Terms\u201d that was wholly favorable to Rosenkrantz,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and several letters of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>support.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Through a representative, District Attorney Gil Garcetti informed the Board that he was \u201cnot opposed to this man receiving a parole date.\u201d There was no negative information presented.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> For the reasons set out in the margin, the panel concluded that Rosenkrantz was <em>not suitable </em>for parole.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b368-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number><em>The August 1998 Parole Suitability Proceedings. </em>Another suitability hearing was held on August 18, 1998. Commissioner Giaquinto was on the panel again, this time joined by Commissioner Manuel Ortega and Deputy Commissioner Cassady. By a vote of two to one (the dissenter was Deputy Commissioner Cassady), Rosenkrantz\u2019s request for a suitability finding was again denied.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Presiding Commissioner Ortega stated the decision this way: \u201c[Tjhe Panel has reviewed all the information received from the public and 'has determined that you\u2019re not suitable for parole. You would pose an <em>unreasonable </em>risk of danger to society. The number one reason was the offense was carried out in a manner which exhibits a callous disregard for the life and the suffering of another. These conclusions are drawn from the Statement of Facts <em>where the prisoner laid in wait for the victim to come out. </em>... He confronted him and, during the course of the confrontation, an argument ensured <em>[sic] </em>and the victim was subsequently shot ten times. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Deputy Commissioner Cassady then explained her reasons for finding Rosenkrantz suitable for parole, after which Commissioner Giaquinto explained his reasons for joining with Commissioner Ortega.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">At the conclusion of the commissioners\u2019 remarks, Rosenkrantz\u2019s lawyer expressed concern that \u201csome Commissioners, either consciously or subconsciously, [were] trying this man as a first degree . . . .\u201d Commissioner Giaquinto interrupted to say, \u201cWe\u2019re not here to do that.\u201d Presiding Commissioner Ortega said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to go off the record now,\u201d then denied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>counsel\u2019s request to remain on the record. There were no further recorded proceedings.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\"><em>The Habeas Corpus Proceedings. </em>Meanwhile, in June or July 1998, Rosenkrantz had filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in which he sought review of the parole suitability decisions made in December 1996 and August 1997. The Board of Prison Terms answered. The petition was put over from time to time and ultimately heard after the August 1998 hearing at which Rosenkrantz had once again been found unsuitable. In March 1999, the superior court granted Rosenkrantz\u2019s habeas corpus petition and ordered the Board of Prison Terms to set a parole date commensurate with Rosenkrantz\u2019s conviction of second degree murder. The superior court\u2019s findings and reasons were stated in a 17-page opinion, excerpts of which are set out in the margin.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b370-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>The Board of Prison Terms sought reconsideration. On April 30, after a further hearing, the superior court issued a modified order directing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>Board of Prison Terms that, \u201c[ujnless there are changed circumstances or new information . . . that was not previously presented to the Board,\u201d the Board was \u201cto set a parole date\u201d for Rosenkrantz. The order states that the parole date is to be commensurate with Rosenkrantz\u2019s conviction of second degree murder, not commensurate with first degree murder or with murder by special circumstances, and also states that, \u201c[i]f a new parole hearing . . . is not held within 90 days of this order, then the defendant shall be ordered released on parole forthwith. [^] The Court also orders that, at the hearing in which a parole date is set, Commissioners Van Court and Giaquinto not sit in judgment as the record reflects that they are biased against the defendant.\u201d The Board of Prison Terms asked for a stay. The superior court denied the request. The Board then filed a notice of appeal and, shortly thereafter, filed a petition for a writ of supersedeas to stay the April 30 order. We issued a temporary stay and requested opposition, then denied the Board\u2019s petition and dissolved the stay.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\"><em>The September 9, 1999, Parole Suitability Proceedings. </em>The Board complied with the 90-day provision of the superior court\u2019s order by setting a parole suitability hearing for September 9, 1999. The hearing was held as scheduled (before Commissioners Dave Hepburn and Leonard Munoz, and Deputy Commissioner Fernando Vazquez). As before, all of the comments about Rosenkrantz\u2019s conduct were \u201claudatory.\u201d He was described by everyone as an exemplary prisoner. He had obtained his bachelor of science degree. There were current letters from the trial judge, from Captain Don Mauro of the Sheriff\u2019s Department Homicide Division stating the department\u2019s nonopposition to parole, a current letter from the investigating deputy (who continued to affirmatively support parole), at least two job offers, and other letters of support (including a letter from the victim\u2019s grandmother, his only living relative, in support of Rosenkrantz\u2019s release). For the reasons set out in the margin, the panel unanimously found Rosenkrantz <em>unsuitable </em>but nevertheless <em>granted </em>a parole date.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In November, the Governor \u201cinvoked his authority to reverse the Board\u2019s decision to grant parole.\u201d (Cal. Const., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>art. V, \u00a7 8; Pen. Code, \u00a7 3041.2.) The Governor\u2019s statement of reasons notes that the Board\u2019s finding of suitability was \u201cbased solely on an order from the Los Angeles Superior Court, which order is now on appeal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\"><em>The Further Proceedings in the Superior Court. </em>In December 1999, Rosenkrantz filed a motion to \u201cenforce\u201d the superior court\u2019s April 30 order in which he claimed that the Board\u2019s failure to find him suitable for parole triggered the clause directing his immediate release. In January 2000, the superior court denied Rosenkrantz\u2019s request for immediate release but ordered the Board of Prison Terms (1) to hold a new suitability hearing within 60 days and (2) to find Rosenkrantz suitable for parole and set a parole date commensurate with Rosenkrantz\u2019s second degree murder conviction.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\"><em>The Board\u2019s Petition for a Writ of Mandate. </em>On January 28, 2000, the Board of Prison Terms filed a petition for a writ of mandate in which it asked us to set aside the superior court\u2019s January 20 order. We issued an order to show cause, set the matter for hearing, and later consolidated the writ proceedings with the Board\u2019s appeal from the April 30, 1999, order. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>Meanwhile, the Board complied with the January 20 order and set another suitability hearing for March 17. Based on the pending appeal and other concerns, Rosenkrantz asked the superior court to vacate its January 20 order. The superior court granted that request, and the March 17 hearing date was thereafter vacated. Although the issue raised by the mandate petition (the superior court\u2019s power to enforce its orders) may be temporarily moot, it is probable that it will arise again. For that reason, we consider the substance of the superior court\u2019s January 20 order (as well as all of the proceedings leading to that order), and address (but do not resolve) the enforcement issue. <em>(Eye Dog Foundation v. State Board of Guide Dogs for the Blind </em>(1967) 67 Cal.2d 536, 541 [63 Cal.Rptr. 21, 432 P.2d 717]; <em>In re William M. </em>(1970) 3 Cal.3d 16, 23 [89 Cal.Rptr. 33, 473 P.2d 737].)<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">The Board of Prison Terms is authorized by statute to determine parole suitability, and to exercise its discretion in deciding whether to grant or deny parole. (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 3040, 5075 et seq.; <em>In re Fain </em>(1983) 145 Cal.App.3d 540, 548 [193 Cal.Rptr. 483].) That discretion, although broad, is not absolute, and the Board\u2019s decisions must be supported by \u201csome evidence.\u201d <em>(In re Powell </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 894, 902-904 [248 Cal.Rptr. 431, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>755 P.2d 881]; see also <em>Terhune </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1998) 65 Cal.App.4th 864, 872-873 [76 Cal.Rptr.2d 841]; <em>In re Minnis </em>(1972) 7 Cal.3d 639, 646-647 [102 Cal.Rptr. 749, 498 P.2d 997] [although a prisoner serving an indeterminate sentence is \u201cnot entitled to have his term fixed at less than the maximum or to receive parole, he is entitled to have his application for these benefits \u2018duly considered\u2019 \u201d].)  On this appeal, the Board of Prison Terms pays lip service to these rules but contends, without reference to the facts of this case, that it acted within its discretion in finding Rosenkrantz unsuitable for parole and that, because the Board says so, the superior court abused its discretion in concluding otherwise. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">The Board of Prison Terms is required to determine parole suitability according to the guidelines set out in section 2402. We address those guidelines seriatim.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">Subdivision (a) of section 2402 provides that, \u201c[r]egardless of the length of time served, a life prisoner shall be found unsuitable for and denied parole if in the judgment of the panel the prisoner will pose an unreasonable risk of danger to society if released from prison.\u201d At the September 9, 1999, suitability hearing, there was no evidence to suggest that Rosenkrantz poses an unreasonable risk to society. All of the evidence is to the contrary. (See fns. 2, 6, 7, <em>ante.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">Subdivision (b) of section 2402 directs the panel to consider \u201c[a]ll relevant, reliable information available\u201d to it, including \u201cthe circumstances of the prisoner\u2019s social history; past and present mental state; past criminal history, including involvement in other criminal misconduct which is reliably documented; the base and other commitment offenses, including behavior before, during and after the crime; past and present attitude toward the crime; any conditions of treatment or control, including the use of special conditions under which the prisoner may safely be released to the community; and any other information which bears on the prisoner\u2019s suitability for release. Circumstances which taken alone may not firmly establish unsuitability for parole may contribute to a pattern which results in a finding of unsuitability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b374-9\">Subdivision (c) of section 2402 sets forth the \u201ccircumstances tending to show unsuitability\u201d for release. With regard to the commitment offense, the Board may consider whether \u201c[t]he prisoner committed the offense in an especially heinous, atrocious or cruel manner.\u201d In determining whether the commitment offense was \u201cespecially heinous, atrocious or cruel,\u201d the Board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>may consider whether there were multiple victims, whether \u201c[t]he offense was carried out in a dispassionate and calculated manner, such as an execution-style murder,\u201d whether \u201c[t]he victim was abused, defiled or mutilated during or after the offense,\u201d whether \u201c[t]he offense was carried out in a manner which demonstrates an exceptionally callous disregard for human suffering,\u201d and whether the \u201cmotive for the crime is inexplicable or very trivial in relation to the offense.\u201d At the September 9, 1999, hearing, the Board\u2019s only unsuitability findings were (1) that the commitment \u201coffense was carried out in [an] especially cruel or callous manner,\u201d (2) that \u201cit was carried out in a dispassionate or calculated manner, such as an execution style murder,\u201d and (3) that \u201cthe offense was carried out in a manner which demonstrates an exceptionally callous disregard for human suffering.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">The first and third findings are insufficient because (a) there is no evidence that Rosenkrantz displayed \u201can exceptionally callous disregard for human <em>suffering\u201d </em>and (b) this finding by itself could not possibly be sufficient since (as the superior court noted) it would necessarily apply to every second degree murder. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Summers </em>(1983) 147 Cal.App.3d 180, 184-185 [195 Cal.Rptr. 21]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Matta </em>(1976) 57 Cal.App.3d 472, 480-481 [129 Cal.Rptr. 205]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Beyea </em>(1974) 38 Cal.App.3d 176, 188-189 [113 Cal.Rptr. 254]; see also CALJIC No. 8.31.) The second finding is insufficient because there is no evidence that this was an \u201cexecution style murder\u201d or anything like that. To the contrary, Rosenkrantz was expressly acquitted of first degree murder. (\u00a7 2326 [\u201c[c]riminal charges not resulting in conviction (charges which resulted in acquittal or dismissal for any reason) shall not affect the parole date unless the factual circumstances surrounding the charge are reliably documented and are an integral part of the crime for which the prisoner is currently committed to prison\u201d]; see <em>In re Lewallen, supra, </em>23 Cal.3d at p. 281, fn. 3 [a sentencing judge may not consider a charge of which the defendant was acquitted].) The Board has <em>never </em>attempted to explain its repeated refusal to follow the law. To the contrary, by \u201cmodifying\u201d the August 1998 transcript to delete the panel\u2019s \u201cinadvertent\u201d description of Rosenkrantz\u2019s offense as \u201ca first degree murder case,\u201d the Board has essentially conceded this point. (Fn. 12, <em>ante.)</em><footnotemark><em>17</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">Subdivision (d) of section 2402 lists the circumstances tending to show suitability, with \u201cthe importance attached to any circumstance or combination of circumstances in a particular case . . . left to the judgment of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>panel.\u201d The circumstances include the absence of a juvenile record, the stability of the prisoner\u2019s relationships with others, signs of remorse, the motivation for the crime (the \u201cprisoner committed his crime as the result of significant stress in his life, especially if the stress ha[d] built over a long period of time\u201d), the absence of a criminal history, the prisoner\u2019s present age (as reducing the probability of recidivism), the prisoner\u2019s post-release plans .for the future, and his institutional behavior when his \u201cactivities indicate an enhanced ability to function within the law upon release.\u201d As the superior court pointed out, every panel (with the exception of the June 1996 panel) that has heard Rosenkrantz\u2019s applications for a determination of parole suitability has failed or refused to consider the uncontroverted fact that Rosenkrantz committed \u201chis crime as the result of significant stress in his life [that] ha[d] built over a long period of time.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">The only \u201cfacts\u201d discussed in the Board\u2019s briefs (on appeal and in support of its writ petition) are the findings made by the commissioners about the nature of Rosenkrantz\u2019s crime. The Board does not cite to a single piece of evidence to support those findings. By way of example, the Board\u2019s brief notes the commissioners\u2019 statement, in rend\u00e9ring their decision, that Rosenkrantz \u201c \u2018needs additional therapy in order to face, and discuss, understand and cope with stress in a nondestructive manner. Until progress is made, the prisoner continues to be unpredictable and a threat to others.\u2019 \u201d There is no reference to any evidence that might support such a finding, and we have found none. Indeed, all of the evidence before the commissioners shows just the opposite\u2014that Rosenkrantz has faced,, discussed, understood and learned to cope with stress in a nondestructive manner, and that he is neither <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>unpredictable nor a threat to others. (See fn. 7, <em>ante.) </em>And while we agree with the Board\u2019s abstract assertion that it was within its province to resolve conflicting evidence <em>(In re Powell, supra, </em>45 Cal.3d at p. 902), the point is patently irrelevant in light of the Board\u2019s admission, in its opening brief, that \u201c[t]here is no conflicting evidence here on the central issues of the findings at Rosenkrantz parole suitability hearings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">On April 30, 1999, the superior court ordered the Board of Prison Terms to hold a new parole suitability hearing and, absent \u201cchanged circumstances or new information . . . that was not previously presented to the Board,\u201d to set a parole date for Rosenkrantz commensurate with his conviction of second degree murder, not first degree murder. In response to the April 30 order, the Board conducted the September 9, 1999, suitability hearing. Although there was not a single changed circumstance or any new information, the panel found Rosenkrantz \u201cunsuitable,\u201d then granted a parole date in order to \u201ccomply\u201d with the April 30 order. For the reasons stated in the preceding sections of this opinion, we agree with Rosenkrantz that the September 9, 1999, finding of unsuitability is unsupported by <em>any </em>evidence and that the panel\u2019s decision cannot stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">Had the superior court not vacated its January 2000 order, our conclusion that the unsuitability finding is unsupported by any evidence would have triggered the superior court\u2019s unconditional order to the Board to find Rosenkrantz \u201csuitable\u201d for parole. It is that order that is challenged by the Board\u2019s petition for a writ of mandate, on the ground that the superior court is without jurisdiction to \u201cdictate the result that must be reached.\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 3040, 3056, 3077; <em>In re Schoengarth </em>(1967) 66 Cal.2d 295, 300, 304 [57 Cal.Rptr. 600, 425 P.2d 200].) When the superior court vacated its January 2000 order, the Board asked that we nevertheless decide this issue on the ground that it is likely to arise again. We decline.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-9\">We conclude that the enforcement issue is not ripe for decision at this time. We reach this conclusion because we do not believe the Board has, as yet, satisfied the spirit of the superior court\u2019s April 30, 1999, order for a new suitability hearing conducted according to the laws of this state and the regulations governing the Board\u2019s parole decisions. It is one thing to go through the motions so that a panel can recite a post hoc rationalization for a decision already made. It is quite another to hold a fair hearing at which three unbiased commissioners actually read the reports and other documents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>in Rosenkrantz\u2019s file and then, make a reasoned decision based on the appropriate factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">At the conclusion of this opinion, we direct the Board to schedule and commence a new suitability hearing within 30 days, <em>and to render a new determination in strict accordance with both the letter and the spirit of the views expressed in this opinion. </em>We do this in deference to the Board\u2019s authority, in recognition of its statutory mandate to calculate the parole date for prisoners serving indeterminate sentences, and in anticipation of the Board\u2019s good faith compliance with our orders. We anticipate that the Board will find Rosenkrantz suitable for release on parole and that a parole date will be set. We emphasize, however, that the superior court will retain jurisdiction over this matter, and that it will have the power to enforce this order as well as its own orders, by contempt or by such other means as it deems appropriate under the circumstances. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7\u00a7 128, subd. (a)(4) [every court has the power to compel obedience to its orders], 1209, subds. (a)(3), (5); <em>In re San Francisco Chronicle </em>(1934) 1 Cal.2d 630, 634 [36 P.2d 369] [courts have inherent power to punish for contempts, whether of a direct or constructive nature, and the other branches cannot constitutionally infringe on that power]; <em>Ross v.

(Cf. <em>Stubblefield Construction Co. </em>v. <em>City of San Bernardino </em>(1995) 32 Cal.App.4th 687, 708-710 [38 Cal.Rptr.2d 413]; <em>Pearson v. City of Grand Blanc </em>(6th Cir. 1992) 961 F.2d 1211, 1216-1217.) It is at that point (if at all) that the enforcement issue will be decided. In the meantime, however, we flatly reject the Board\u2019s contention that (a) Rosenkrantz\u2019s only remedy is the continuing charade of meaningless hearings, and (b) that the superior court lacks the power to compel the Board to follow the law.

The total of events are truly a tragedy that sadly affected the lives of many good people. If only Robert\u2019s father and mother did not care for him so deeply. If only they did not have such high expectations for him he could have easily admitted his homosexual tendencies without fear or shame. If only Robert\u2019s brother Joseph did not see the opportunity to exploit Robert\u2019s secret to his own sibling advantage.

In this case, the defendant was Expressly Acquitted of First Degree Murder. <em>The jury found the defendant not guilty of premeditation and deliberation. </em>This was after a trial in which the defendant himself testified about the circumstances of the offense. In reading the comments of the commissioners at the last three hearings and the statements of decision, it is apparent that some commissioners decided on their own that the evidence supports , a finding of premeditation and lying in wait and have based their decisions denying parole on these findings, contrary to the express findings of the jury. <em>The primary reason for denying parole in all three hearings is that the offense was \u2018dispassionate\u2019 and \u2018calculated\u2019 and/or was \u2018carried out in a manner which exhibits a callous disregard for the life and suffering of another.\u2019</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-10\">\u201c \u2018Dispassionate\u2019 means \u2018free from emotion or prejudice; calm and impartial.\u2019 . . . No rational person could describe this killing as calm and without emotion. . . . flU \u2018Calculated\u2019 means \u2018planned.\u2019 . . . The verdict expressly rejected that th\u00e9 killing was planned. <em>In finding the defendant not guilty of premeditation and deliberation, the jury must have accepted the defendant\u2019s claim that he did not go to the house planning to murder the victim. In finding him </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number><em>guilty of second degree murder, they found that he did not form the intent to kill until just shortly before the killing. The finding that the killing was \u2018dispassionate\u2019 and \u2018calculated\u2019 is contrary to the evidence and contrary to the verdict of the jury.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-5\">\u201cAt the last hearing of the Board of Prison Terms, the commissioners must have finally realized that this factor, that is, that the killing was \u2018dispassionate and calculated\u2019 was not applicable to this case. Instead they found that the \u2018offense was carried out in a manner which exhibits a callous disregard for the life and suffering of another.\u2019 <em>{Of course, all second degree murders by their nature involve a disregard for the life of another.) </em>The regulations word this factor slightly differently: \u2018The offense was carried out in a manner which demonstrates an exceptionally callous disregard for human suffering.\u2019 [\u00a7 2402, subd. (c)(1)(D).] <em>This appears to refer to something akin to torture or that the victim suffered much more than that which would be inherent in any killing. </em>There is no evidence of that in this case. In support of this \u2018callous disregard\u2019 finding, the Board stated, \u2018These conclusions are drawn from the Statement of Facts where the prisoner laid in wait for the victim to come out.\u2019 . . . <em>\u2018Lying in wait\u2019 is a special circumstance </em>which, if found to be true by a jury, requires a sentence of life without the possibility of parole. . . . Apparently recognizing that this may seem inconsistent with a verdict of second degree murder, legal counsel [for the Board] recommended that \u2018laid in wait for the victim to come out\u2019 be deleted and replaced with \u2018waited in his vehicle all night outside the victim\u2019s condominium complex, until the victim emerged.\u2019 <em>There is nothing in this case to support a finding of an exceptionally callous disregard for the suffering of another.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-6\">\u201cOn the other hand, the decisions make little or no mention of any circumstance of the offense weighing in the defendant\u2019s favor. One of the factors tending to show suitability for parole is \u2018Motivation for Crime:\u2019 [HJ \u2018The prisoner <em>committed his crime as the result of significant stress in his life, </em>especially if the stress has built over a long period of time.\u2019 [\u00a7 2402.] . . . <em>This factor, which is clearly supported by the evidence, was completely ignored. . . .</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-7\">\u201cThe Court also finds that Commissioners Van Court and Giaquinto are biased against the defendant and should not participate in his parole hearing.\u201d (Italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">At this point, the superior court discusses Commissioner Van Court\u2019s statement, \u201cthat\u2019s first-degree murder if I ever saw one, the actual crime itself,\u201d and notes that (at the same hearing) Commissioner Giaquinto stated that this offense was \u201cas terrible as some of these drive by gang shootings we see.\u201d Commissioner Giaquinto\u2019s comments about the letter from the legislators, quoted in footnote 9, <em>ante, </em>were quoted by the superior court. The superior court then continued thus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-9\"><em>\u201cAlthough the letters may have gotten a few facts wrong . . . , Commissioner Giaquinto appears to be mistaken about other things which he felt were misrepresentations. </em>... [10 It seems strange that Commissioner Giaquinto should be so enraged that the victim is depicted as having committed felonies. Residential burglary, assault with a deadly weapon, assault resulting in great bodily injury are all not only felonies, but \u2018strikes\u2019 as well under current law. ... [10 Commissioner Giaquinto also seemed offended that the defendant\u2019s father is an attorney who has money and who has tried very hard to help his son get released. Just as it is inappropriate to be biased against the poor, it is also inappropriate to be biased against the wealthy. . . . [After quoting a statement that Commissioner Giaquinto made to Rosenkrantz in which the commissioner referred to Rosenkrantz as \u201cpal,\u201d the court described the] use of the term \u2018pal\u2019 [a]s unprofessional and demeaning. The commissioner and the inmate are not pals, and they both know it. To understand how demeaning it is, one need only to imagine how it would sound if the inmate referred to the commissioner as \u2018pal.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-10\">\u201c[Generally, all of the hearings for the Board of Prison Terms held in one week are staffed by the same three commissioners. Rosenkrantz\u2019s lawyer] alleges that the three commissioners <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>normally assigned that week did not conduct this hearing; rather Commissioner Giaquinto was substituted in for one of the commissioners for only this hearing and perhaps one or two other hearings. The claim is that Commissioner Giaquinto must have specifically requested to substitute in on this hearing so that he could insure that the defendant was denied parole. Since this court has already found that Commissioner Giaquinto was biased against the defendant, there is no need to conduct an evidentiary hearing into whether or not this is true. If it were true, I am sure that the chair of the Board would put a stop to such a practice.\u201d (Italics added.)</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b371-7\">\u201cMr. Rosenkrantz, we found you <em>unsuitable </em>for parole but we are granting you a parole date today .... The Panel reviewed all information received from the public and relied on the following circumstances in concluding that the prisoner is not suitable for parole and would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to society or a threat to public safety if released from prison. <em>The number one reason, really the only reason, is the commitment offense itself. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>You\u2019ve done tremendously while you\u2019ve been in the institution, you\u2019ve made- tremendous progress. But it\u2019s the nature of the crime itself is the reason we found you unsuitable for parole. The Panel found that <em>the offense was carried out in especially cruel or callous manner and that it was carried out in a dispassionate or calculated manner, such as an execution style murder, and that the offense was carried out in a manner which demonstrates an exceptionally callous disregard for human suffering. . . . </em>[T]he prisoner\u2019s gains are recent and he must demonstrate an ability to maintain gains over an extended period of time. Nevertheless, the prisoner should be commended for remaining disciplinary-free, for upgrading educationally, including receiving a Bachelors Degree, for doing computer programming work that has benefited [the Department of Corrections], and for participating in self-help groups. However, these positive aspects of his behavior do not outweigh the factors of unsuitability. However, pursuant to a Court Order . , . dated April 30, 1999 . . . , this Panel is required to set a parole date. Therefore, pursuant to this Order, we are granting you a parole date today. The calculation of the parole date is as follows. . . .\u201d (Italics added.) Although the method of calculating Rosenkrantz\u2019s release date was discussed, no release date was stated. The proceedings terminated following the Presiding Commissioner\u2019s comment that Rosenkrantz was \u201cnot to be released prior to the Governor exercising his review authority.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b372-7\">In its January 20, 2000, order, the superior court found \u201cthe Board of Prison Terms did not comply with the court\u2019s [April 30, 1999, order]. Accordingly, the court orders the Board of Prison Terms to hold a new parole consideration hearing within sixty days for Mr. Rosenkrantz. Unless there are changed circumstances or new information is presented that was not previously presented to the Board at this hearing, you are ordered to find Mr. Rosenkrantz suitable for parole. [IQ You are further ordered not to find that the offense was carried out in an especially cruel or callous manner, that the offense was carried out in a dispassionate manner, such as an execution style murder, or that the offense was carried out in a manner which demonstrates an exceptionally callous disregard for human suffering. flQ The Board is then ordered to set a parole date or base term . . . commensurate with Mr. Rosenkrantz\u2019s conviction for Second Degree Murder, not commensurate with first degree murder or murder by special circumstances.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b373-8\">The practical effect of a parole suitability finding is that a base term is set. (\u00a7 2403, subd. (a).) The regulations include a \u201cmatrix\u201d of base terms for second degree murders committed after November 8, 1978 (\u00a7 2403, subds. (a), (c)), but the application of that matrix to Rosenkrantz appears to depend on the findings made at the time of the suitability hearing. For example, it appears that, at the time of the June 1996 suitability finding (the one reversed by the Decision Review Unit), the panel fixed Rosenkrantz\u2019s base term at 172 months, added 24 months for the firearm enhancement, and deducted 35 months for conduct credits, for a total confinement time of 13.4 years. At the time of the September 1999 hearing (where a parole date was set notwithstanding a finding of unsuitability, then vacated by the Governor), the panel increased the base term and arrived (we think) at a total confinement period of 14.6 years. According to the statistics published by the Department of Corrections for the Board of Prison Terms, it appears that (in 1998) the \u201cmedian\u201d time served in prison for second degree murder was 183.7 months (15.3 years). (For general information, see http://www.dof.ca.gov/ html/fs_data/stat-abs/sec_N.htm [the Department of Finance's Web site]; see also http:// www.bpt.ca.gov/ [the Board of Prison Terms Web site].) Since \u201cmedian\u201d means \u201cin the middle,\u201d we consider it safe to assume that, of the 12 second degree murder prisoners released on parole in 1998, 6 served fewer than 183 months and 6 served longer terms. <em>(Ibid.; </em>Webster's 3d New Internal. Dict. (1981) p. 1402.) The recently released data for 1999 shows that, for the two prisoners released on parole in 1999 who had been committed for second degree murder, the median time served in prison was only 126.3 months (roughly 10\u00bd years). (http://www.cdc.state.ca.us/reports/timesrv99.htm.) Without conduct credits, Rosenkrantz has served at least 168 months (14 years). With conduct credits, he has served at least 220 months (18.3 years). It is unclear whether the Board\u2019s published statistics include or exclude conduct credits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b375-7\">At the September 9, 1999, hearing, the panel did not find (and on the evidence could not have found) any other circumstance tending to show unsuitability.

(c)(2)-(6) [a previous record of violence, an unstable social history, sadistic sexual offenses, a lengthy history of severe mental problems related to the offense, serious misconduct in prison or jail].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b376-6\">In this regard, we note the Board\u2019s contention that \u201ca parole denial may ultimately be based entirely on the nature of the commitment offense, as long as all other administratively prescribed \u2018relevant factors\u2019 have been considered\u201d by the Board. We agree (\u00a7 2402, subd.

As shown by the transcript of the September 9, 1999, hearing, the commissioners had not even read a number of the reports that are in Rosenkrantz\u2019s file. (See <em>Dunn v. U.S. Parole Com'n </em>(10th Cir. 1987) 818 F.2d 742, 745 [rejecting a parole decision \u201costensibly based\u201d on parole risk because the record made it clear that the use of an 18-year-old insanity acquittal to calculate a presumptive parole date was based solely on punitive considerations; there was no evidence to support a finding of parole risk based on current mental illness, only a favorable recommendation based on exemplary institutional adjustment and a conclusion by the prison staff psychologist that the prisoner was not mentally ill; for these reasons, the denial was arbitrary and capricious and an abuse of discretion].)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
