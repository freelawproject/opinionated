On September 30, 1999, after preliminary consideration of the petition, this court notified the parties that it \u201cmay elect to issue a peremptory writ in the first instance\u201d and ordered Superior Court to serve and file an opposition to the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-11\">On October 7, 1999, the People, the real party in interest, notified this court that \u201cthe Los Angeles County District Attorney\u2019s Office takes no position on whether petitioner\u2019s motion for appointment of an expert should be granted and therefore will not file an opposition to the petition.\u201d On October 14, 1999, county counsel, on behalf of Superior Court, filed an opposition to the petition. County counsel apprised this court of the possible bar to counsel\u2019s representation of Superior Court as presented by <em>Doe v. Superior Court </em>(1996) 39 Cal.App.4th 538, 540, footnote 1 [45 Cal.Rptr.2d 888]. County counsel asked this court to reconsider <em>Doe </em>and to publish an opinion \u201cindicating that the County Counsel may file opposition on behalf of the Superior Court in these cases notwithstanding <em>Doe.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b234-12\">In the order to show cause, this court directed Superior Court and James G. to address \u201cthe issue of superior court representation by the County Counsel\u201d in light of <em>Doe.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b235-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>B. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\">1. <em>Superior Court Can Appear in This Writ Proceeding.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">A threshold issue to the question of the county counsel\u2019s legal representation of Superior Court, is whether Superior Court has standing to appear as a party in the appellate court to <em>defend </em>the validity of its ruling denying the motion for appointment of the expert. Under these exceptional facts, we conclude Superior Court\u2019s appearance in the appellate court is warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">Superior Court is a \u201cparty\u201d in an original mandate proceeding before this court; Superior Court is named as the \u201cRespondent.\u201d As such, proof of service must be served upon it, and it is authorized by statute to file points and authorities in opposition. (See Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1107.)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In addition, Government Code section 27647 assumes Superior Court may appear as a party in an action.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">This notwithstanding, as discussed below, California case law provides that a trial court may not <em>initiate </em>writ proceedings and may appear to <em>defend </em>itself in a writ proceeding only in a limited number of circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">In <em>Municipal Court </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(Gonzalez) (1993) 5 Cal.4th 1126 [22 Cal.Rptr.2d 504, 857 P.2d 325] <em>(Gonzalez), </em>the Supreme Court considered a petition for a writ of mandate brought by the municipal court against the superior court\u2019s ruling granting a criminal defendant\u2019s habeas corpus petition. In <em>Gonzalez </em>the municipal court had a policy of assigning court commissioners to determine whether probable cause existed to detain the defendants arrested without warrants. Gonzalez challenged his detention under this policy, and the superior court granted him habeas corpus relief. Thereafter, the municipal court instituted a writ proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-9\">The <em>Gonzalez </em>court held that the lower court lacked standing to <em>initiate </em>a writ proceeding. The Supreme Court reasoned: \u201c \u2018In our common law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>judicial system we rely upon a separation of roles to bring about the proper results. The courts\u2019 role is to decide cases; the parties\u2019 role is to bring cases before the courts. If a party is aggrieved by the ruling of [the] lower court, he is provided with an avenue of appeal to a higher tribunal by means of an orderly prescribed procedure .... [T]he premise under which the judiciary operates is straightforward: if no individual party finds it worth his or her while to champion the cause and seek judicial review, then review will not occur.\u2019 \u201d (5 Cal.4th at p. 1131.)</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">The premise underlying the Supreme Court\u2019s decision is twofold.  First, the trial court in a writ proceeding, though a nominal respondent, is nonetheless a neutral party in the underlying controversy between the parties, and as such, has a duty to remain impartial. Second, the real party in interest, not the respondent court, has beneficial interest in the litigation and is the aggrieved party, i.e., the adverse party in whose favor the act complained of has been done. As the aggrieved party, the real party in interest is the party with sufficient interest in the subject matter of the dispute to press its case with vigor.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">In many if not most instances, the real party in interest will have sufficient interest in the outcome of the proceeding to oppose the petition, i.e., to defend the actions of the trial court. However, as the court in <em>Ng v. Superior Court </em>(1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 1010, 1017-1019 [61 Cal.Rptr.2d 49] recognized, there are a limited number of cases where the real party in interest is not a real adverse party, has suffered no harm, or has no interest in the writ proceeding. For example, where a writ of prohibition is sought to prevent a disqualified judge from hearing a matter, only the court may have a beneficial interest in the matter. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1019-1020.) Likewise, the <em>Ng </em>court, relying on Justice Kennard\u2019s concurring and dissenting opinion in <em>Gonzalez, supra, </em>5 Cal.4th at p. 1133, also recognized that lower courts have been allowed to appear in writ proceedings to <em>defend </em>their actions, when: (1) the real party in interest did not appear; and (2) \u201c[t]he issue involved directly impacted the operations and procedures of the court or potentially imposed financial obligations which would directly affect the court\u2019s operations.\u201d <em>(Ng v. Superior Court, supra, </em>52 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1018-1019.)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">The <em>Ng </em>court further acknowledged that when a court does not prevail in a writ proceeding brought by a litigant assailing the validity of one of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>court\u2019s procedures, the court has been permitted to seek higher review of the adverse ruling, either by filing a notice of appeal (if the ruling was by the superior court) or by filing a petition for review in the Supreme Court (if the ruling was by the Court of Appeal). <em>(Ng v. Superior Court, supra, </em>52 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1017-1018.)</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\"><em>Ng </em>concerned the defendant\u2019s petition for writ of mandate, directing the trial court to vacate its order denying Ng\u2019s motion to reinstate the public defender as trial counsel. The trial judge appeared in the writ proceeding and filed a return and a declaration explaining the reasons for his decision. The <em>Ng </em>court concluded that the superior court did not have standing in the appellate court to defend its ruling because the respondent court failed to demonstrate that the issue in the particular writ proceeding had any direct effect on the court\u2019s operating procedures or budget. (52 Cal.App.4th at p. 1019.)</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">James G. urges this court to apply <em>Ng </em>and find Superior Court lacks standing to appear in this proceeding. James G. points out that neither of the two exceptions posited by <em>Ng </em>operates here. He is correct. This petition does not concern disqualification of the trial judge, nor does it involve issues which impact the operations, procedures or budget of the court. Superior Court asserts the appointment of an expert might impact the court\u2019s budget, but made no genuine attempt in the opposition to the petition to justify its actions on the basis of some institutional procedure. No party has ever argued that the issue in the particular writ proceeding had any direct effect on the court\u2019s operating procedures or budget.* ****<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b238-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>This notwithstanding, there is a significant dispositive difference between this case and <em>Ng.</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Here, both James G.\u2019s underlying motion and his petition were filed ex parte, under seal with the contents and arguments kept confidential. Accordingly, the real party in Interest, the People, was not entitled to know of the trial court\u2019s ruling or the writ challenging the ruling. In view of the special confidential nature of the case, the real party in interest could not meaningfully oppose the petition. This is not a situation where Superior Court sought to appear in the action simply because the real party in interest chose not to do so. In fact, this court directed Superior Court to appear and without Superior Court\u2019s appearance there was no representation of the adverse position, no party to ensure that the record was fully and appropriately presented to this court, no view of the issues and facts except through the partisan perspective of James G.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">In addition, there is no aggrieved or adverse party in whose favor the complained of act has been done. Superior Court\u2019s denial of James G.\u2019s motion did not benefit the People. A potential harm has, nonetheless, occurred. Superior Court committed an adverse act\u2014an act which no party other than Superior Court, because of the confidential nature of the case, can adequately defend or explain. Thus, here Superior Court\u2019s appearance is essential in this case for meaningful appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">James G. argues that Superior Court\u2019s participation is unnecessary. He asserts the appellate court can conduct its own review of the confidential information and in camera proceedings and independently determine the law and facts without the participation of the real party in interest or the respondent court. James G. notes the Supreme Court recognized such independent review in <em>People </em>v. <em>Hobbs </em>(1994) 7 Cal.4th 948, 973-974 [30 Cal.Rptr.2d 651, 873 P.2d 1246]. In <em>Hobbs, </em>the trial court presided over an in camera hearing (without participation of the defendant or defense counsel) concerning sealing a search warrant to protect the identity of a confidential informant. We are not persuaded that the independent review described in <em>Hobbs </em>would be effective here. In <em>Hobbs, </em>the trial court had the physical evidence\u2014the documents, and witnesses\u2014before it. The trial court could conduct a firsthand examination and assessment of the evidence and question the witnesses. In the context of this writ proceeding, this court examines <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>only the cold record. Therefore, if questions or concerns arise which require more than the defendant\u2019s partisan explanation, this court should be able to look to the trial court, only other party present at the ex parte proceeding, for an explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">Our decision to allow Superior Court to appear at our behest in this confidential proceeding is also grounded on the public interest. While our system of justice depends on the neutrality and impartiality of the courts, it also depends on the <em>adverse testing </em>of facts and legal theories to advance truth and fairness.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">Accordingly, under these unique facts, to protect the defendant\u2019s confidentiality while advancing the interests of justice and fair process, we conclude the participation by Superior Court is justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">2. <em>The County Counsel May Represent Superior Court.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">In <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>39 Cal.App.4th 538, 540-541, footnote 1, the court indicated, in pertinent part: \u201c[T]he petition before us was filed under seal and clearly marked \u2018confidential,\u2019 with a notation that neither the prosecutor nor county counsel were to be apprised of [the appellant\u2019s] request for an expert. The Superior Court, as the named respondent, was the only party served with a copy of the petition and its exhibits ... the Court nevertheless turned the matter over to County Counsel (with copies of [the petitioner\u2019s] petition and the exhibits) and County Counsel filed a return on the Court\u2019s behalf .... [W]e note that nothing should have been turned over to County Counsel by the Superior Court <em>(Corenevsky </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1984) 36 Cal.3d 307, 320, fn. 12 [204 Cal.Rptr. 165, 682 P.2d 360].) The Superior Court could have filed its own return or, if County Counsel\u2019s assistance was needed, the Court should have provided County Counsel with a simple statement of the issue, without the facts of the offense charged against [the petitioner], without the declarations about [the petitioner\u2019s] personal history, and without names. Since the only points County Counsel makes on the Court\u2019s behalf pertain to budgetary problems and other matters of court administration, there was no reason to disclose anything about this particular case.\u201d (Italics omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">County counsel asserts that this language precludes it from representing Superior Court. This language in <em>Doe </em>is correct in part, but has created some confusion which requires clarification.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-9\">There is no question that pursuant to Government Code section 27647, county counsel may provide legal representation to Superior Court. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>addition, James G. is entitled to confidentiality in these proceedings. Thus, the crucial issue is how to strike the proper balance between protecting James G.\u2019s confidentiality and affording Superior Court\u2019s counsel enough information to provide effective legal representation. <em>Doe </em>suggests part of the answer. In situations, such as <em>Doe, </em>where the matter at issue does not concern the underlying merits of the case\u2014where the case concerns the court\u2019s procedures, budgetary issues or court administration\u2014it is unnecessary for the county counsel to learn any confidential information. As <em>Doe </em>suggests, the superior court should not disclose any confidential information about the facts of the case, but should provide county counsel with a basic statement of the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">However, the case before us is different. Here the issue involves the underlying facts of the case and reveals defense strategy. Thus, county counsel\u2019s effective representation of Superior Court requires the disclosure of confidential information contained in the petition and the exhibits. In this context, access to sealed information is authorized under California Rules of Court, rule 33.5(b)(2).* *****<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We envision that disclosure of confidential information to county counsel would be more the exception than the rule; it certainly should not be done automatically. Instead, if county counsel seeks the disclosure of documents or information filed under seal, county counsel should file an appropriate motion with this court demonstrating why the information sought is necessary to provide effective representation. Upon such a showing, to maintain the confidentiality of the proceedings and to prevent disclosure of confidential information to the prosecution, this court will issue a protective order. Insofar as <em>Doe </em>precludes such a procedure, we decline to follow it.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that in cases such as this, the trial court can, with an appropriate protective order to ensure confidentiality, call upon county counsel to represent it.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">A peremptory writ of mandate shall issue directing the respondent to vacate its order denying petitioner\u2019s request for appointment of an expert, and to issue a new order appointing the expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">Johnson, Acting P.
