Lukey of Cincinnati, Ohio, Attorney Registration No. 0000965, was admitted to the practice of law in Ohio in 1975.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">{\u00b6 2} On February 7, 2005, relator, Cincinnati Bar Association, charged respondent with professional misconduct. A panel of the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline heard the cause, considered the parties\u2019 exhibits and comprehensive stipulations, and made findings of fact, conclusions of law, and a recommendation. The board adopted the panel\u2019s findings of misconduct, but increased the recommended sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-9\">Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b441-10\">{\u00b6 3} Respondent, a sole practitioner since 1977, practices mainly domestic-relations and juvenile law. During the summer of 2004, a married couple retained respondent to represent them in anticipated custody/dependency proceedings involving their 13-year-old grandson, whom they had adopted years before. The charges of misconduct against respondent arose because respondent acted as the grandson\u2019s attorney during juvenile court proceedings, despite the fact that the boy was already represented by a public defender. At the same time, the respondent represented the boy\u2019s grandparents relative to the dependency proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-11\">{\u00b6 4} Authorities in Hamilton County initiated the dependency proceedings because the grandparents, in an attempt to keep the grandson out of trouble after he was charged with two counts of aggravated arson, had locked him in the basement while they were at work. On July 28, 2004, the boy was placed in protective custody because of suspicions that he was being mistreated.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-12\">{\u00b6 5} The grandson had been charged with aggravated arson because he had set fire to two paper towels in a school bathroom, albeit without causing any injuries or property damage. On July 7, 2004, Soumyhait Dutta, a public defender assigned to represent the grandson, entered denials on the boy\u2019s behalf. Dutta also represented the grandson on July 15, 2004, when the court continued the trial in the case until August 12, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-13\">{\u00b6 6} Respondent appeared with his clients at their grandson\u2019s August 12 trial; however, he did not confine himself to representing their interests. Without having investigated the case or having previously spoken to the boy, respondent acted as the grandson\u2019s counsel and negotiated a plea agreement with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>prosecutor in the case. The prosecutor agreed to dismiss the first-degree felony aggravated-arson charge in exchange for the grandson\u2019s admission to a second-degree felony charge of aggravated arson.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">{\u00b6 7} Shortly after these negotiations (which took place before the case was called), a public defender appeared, at Dutta\u2019s request, to defend the grandson. The prosecutor introduced respondent as the boy\u2019s private attorney, and when respondent confirmed this representation, the public defender left. Respondent and the prosecutor then presented the negotiated plea agreement to the magistrate, and respondent again represented that he was the grandson\u2019s lawyer. The magistrate consequently substituted respondent for the public defender as counsel of record.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">{\u00b6 8} Respondent sat with the grandson at counsel\u2019s table during the proceedings on August 12. After the prosecutor\u2019s brief statement of the case against the grandson, respondent allowed the boy to admit committing aggravated arson, a second-degree felony. Respondent then offered only this statement in mitigation: \u201c[The] grandparents have done what they can to control him, but they\u2019re maybe a little older and they both have to work. And it\u2019s really a difficult situation at home. The grandparents had tried to do the best they can.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">{\u00b6 9} During the August 12 proceedings, the magistrate inquired of a Hamilton County Job and Family Services caseworker about that agency\u2019s interest in the case. The caseworker failed to report that the boy had been removed from his grandparents\u2019 home because of mistreatment, and respondent, who should have realized the mistake, said nothing. His silence concealed from the court the grandparents\u2019 and their grandson\u2019s conflicting interests and deterred the magistrate from appointing a guardian ad litem.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">{\u00b6 10} At the end of the August 12 hearing, the magistrate set the cause for a final disposition on August 26, 2004, pending completion of a probation report, and she ordered that the boy be held in detention until that date. The magistrate ordered detention without knowing the substantial mitigating factors that respondent, as the boy\u2019s attorney, should have presented \u2014 that the grandson was polite and cooperative, played orchestral harp, displayed no antisocial or criminal behaviors, regretted burning the paper towels at school, had waited for the fire to burn out before he left the bathroom, and had never meant to harm anyone.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-9\">{\u00b6 11} Another magistrate conducted the hearing on August 26, 2004. After reviewing the probation report, which recommended that the grandson be placed on nonreporting probation due to his minimal risk factors, the magistrate asked respondent to speak on the boy\u2019s behalf. Respondent began by referring to his clients\u2019 inability to control their grandson, and the magistrate stopped him to clarify whom he represented. Respondent advised that he represented the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>grandparents, although he also admitted that he had counseled their grandson in entering his guilty plea. Respondent explained to the magistrate that he did not consider his advice to the grandson to be representation because the boy had already admitted guilt. At the panel hearing, respondent asserted that he had taken on the grandson\u2019s case to help his clients, without realizing the conflicting interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">{\u00b6 12} Respondent\u2019s revelation caused the magistrate to remove respondent as counsel of record and to reinstate the public defender. The court later appointed a guardian ad litem to represent the grandson\u2019s interests and granted the public defender\u2019s motion to set aside the boy\u2019s admission. The public defender eventually negotiated a plea to a lesser offense, and the grandson was placed in the temporary custody of his paternal grandmother. The dependency proceedings were later dismissed, and the grandson eventually returned to live with his maternal grandparents. The magistrates presiding over the grandson\u2019s case and the court\u2019s chief magistrate reported respondent\u2019s improprieties to relator.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">{\u00b6 13} Respondent admitted and the board found that in failing to disclose his dual representation to the court and purporting to represent the grandson while pursuing the grandparents\u2019 interests, he had violated DR 1-102(A)(4) (prohibiting conduct involving fraud, deceit, dishonesty, or misrepresentation). Respondent also admitted and the board found that he had violated DR 1-102(A)(5) (prohibiting conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice) because the dual representation deprived the grandson of competent, independent counsel. Respondent admitted and the board found that respondent\u2019s representation of clients with conflicting interests violated DR 5-105(B) (prohibiting, with limited exceptions, a lawyer from continuing to represent multiple clients where the lawyer\u2019s independent judgment on behalf of any client is likely to be adversely affected). Respondent admitted and the board found a violation of DR 7-101(A)(3) (prohibiting a lawyer from causing a client damage or prejudice) because his failure to provide available mitigation evidence resulted in the grandson\u2019s extended detention. The board further found a violation of DR 7-106(B)(2) (requiring a lawyer to disclose the identity of his clients to a tribunal).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">Recommended Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b443-8\">{\u00b6 14} In recommending a sanction for respondent\u2019s misconduct, the panel and board weighed the mitigating and aggravating factors of his case. See Section 10 of the Rules and Regulations Governing Procedure on Complaints and Hearings Before the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline (\u201cBCGD Proc.Reg.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-9\">{\u00b6 15} In mitigation, the panel and board found that respondent had no record of prior professional discipline and that he had been cooperative and truthful during the disciplinary process. BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2)(a) and (d). Respon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>dent also cited his active membership in the Cincinnati Bar Association and participation in the Sister City Program as mitigating factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">{\u00b6 16} As aggravating factors, the panel and board found that respondent\u2019s victim, the grandson, was very vulnerable and suffered serious harm, including the boy\u2019s two-week detention due to respondent\u2019s inadequate representation. Respondent admitted that he did not zealously represent the grandson and that while professing to represent the boy, respondent\u2019s goal had been to keep him from returning to his grandparents\u2019 home.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">{\u00b6 17} Though respondent claimed to accept responsibility for and to regret his misconduct, the panel and board were skeptical that he genuinely appreciated the extent of his wrongdoing. BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(1)(G). The panel tried to imagine the confusion and fear this 13-year-old boy must have experienced upon entering the courtroom, learning that a stranger had negotiated for him to plead guilty to a very serious crime, and then being taken away to detention. Respondent\u2019s failure to display any real compassion for the boy deeply troubled the panel, and the board shared that concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">{\u00b6 18} Relator proposed that respondent be suspended from the practice of law for six months. Respondent advocated a six-month suspension with the entire period stayed.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">{\u00b6 19} The panel recommended that respondent\u2019s license to practice be suspended for two years, with the entire period to be stayed provided that respondent serve a two-year probation. The panel further recommended that a monitoring attorney, appointed by relator, oversee respondent\u2019s practice during the probation and counsel him on proper case preparation and client communication. The board recommended a more severe sanction, citing \u201c[rjespondent\u2019s lack of concern for the juvenile client or interest in his representation.\u201d The board recommended a two-year suspension with 18 months stayed and probation under the same conditions recommended by the panel during the stayed suspension. Respondent objects to the board\u2019s recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">Review</p>\n<p id=\"b444-9\">{\u00b6 20} We agree that respondent violated DR 1-102(A)(4), 1-102(A)(5), 5-105(B), 7-101(A)(3), and 7-106(B)(2), as found by the board. We also overrule respondent\u2019s objections and adopt the board\u2019s recommended sanction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b444-10\">{\u00b6 21} Respondent argues in favor of the panel\u2019s two-year, conditionally stayed suspension, urging us to defer to the panel\u2019s credibility determinations as to the sincerity of his remorse. We have. Neither the panel nor the board was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>convinced that respondent truly regretted his misconduct or realized its gravity. Upon review of respondent\u2019s testimony and the exhibits, we also doubt respondent\u2019s contrition.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b445-10\">William E. Clements; Peter Rosenwald; and Dimity V. Orlet, Assistant Bar Counsel, for relator.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b445-11\">Jeffrey L. Adams, for respondent.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">{\u00b6 22} Respondent also asserts that mitigating factors militate against an actual suspension. We disagree. Respondent\u2019s dual representation seriously compromised this juvenile and the legal process. Respondent completely disregarded the grandson\u2019s right to competent, independent counsel and impeded the magistrates\u2019 efforts to safeguard that right. That a lawyer would pose as counsel for an adverse party in any case is egregious, but such pretense is unthinkable when a child\u2019s interests are at stake.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">{\u00b6 23} An actual suspension of a lawyer\u2019s license to practice is the appropriate sanction when the lawyer has intentionally misrepresented a crucial fact to a court in order to benefit a party. <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Greene </em>(1995), 74 Ohio St.3d 13, 16-17, 655 N.E.2d 1299. Respondent deliberately misrepresented his status as defense counsel to juvenile court magistrates, a prosecutor, and a public defender to prevent his clients\u2019 grandson from returning to live with his clients. Respondent\u2019s misconduct thus warrants an actual suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">{\u00b6 24} Respondent is therefore suspended from the practice of law in Ohio for two years; however, the last 18 months of the suspension are stayed on the conditions that respondent commit no further misconduct and serve an 18-month probation pursuant to Gov.Bar R. V(9). During the probation, respondent shall allow a monitoring attorney, appointed by relator, to oversee his practice and counsel him on proper case preparation and client communication. If respondent fails to comply with the terms of the stay, the stay will be lifted and he shall serve the entire two-year suspension. Costs are taxed to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-8\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b445-9\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell and Lanzinger, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b444-11\">. Relator\u2019s motion to strike respondent\u2019s objections for failure to comply with the briefing requirements of S.Ct.Prac.R. VI is overruled.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
