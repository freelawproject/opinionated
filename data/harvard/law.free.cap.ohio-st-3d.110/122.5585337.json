A panel of the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline heard the cause and accepted the parties\u2019 stipulations, including relator\u2019s withdrawal of Count V. The panel made findings of misconduct and a recommendation, which the board adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-13\">Respondent\u2019s Background</p>\n<p id=\"b434-14\">{\u00b6 3} After graduating from law school and relocating to Portsmouth, respondent worked for the Scioto County prosecutor\u2019s office for many years, beginning in 1979. In 1995, he was appointed Portsmouth City Solicitor. The next'year, respondent opened a private practice in which he remained until he returned to work for the prosecutor\u2019s office in 2001. Since August 2004, respondent has been employed as legal counsel by the Scioto County Board of Commissioners. He also has a small private practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-15\">Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"Aip\">\n<em>Count I</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b434-16\">{\u00b6 4} Robert Ramsey retained respondent in November 2002 to represent him in an employment-related claim. Ramsey and respondent signed a fee agreement, and Ramsey paid respondent $1,500 as a retainer. From December 2, 2002, to December 1, 2003, Ramsey called respondent 22 times and left messages. Respondent did not return any of Ramsey\u2019s calls.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>{\u00b6 5} Although respondent did not stay in contact with his client, he did research legal aspects of Ramsey\u2019s case and write letters on his behalf. Respondent believed that he had advised Ramsey, in accordance with DR 1-104(A), that he did not carry malpractice insurance; however, respondent acknowledged that he did not fully comply with the notification and acknowledgment procedures of the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">{\u00b6 6} Respondent stipulated and the board found that in representing Ramsey, respondent had violated DR 1-104(A) (requiring a lawyer to properly advise a client that the lawyer does not maintain professional liability insurance) and 6-101(A)(3) (prohibiting neglect of an entrusted legal matter).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">\n<em>Count II</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">{\u00b6 7} In early December 2002, Robin Bissell retained respondent to represent her in an employment-related claim. On December 19, 2002, Bissell paid respondent $2,200, of which, respondent deposited $200 into his client trust account for costs and the remaining $2,000 into his business operating account. At that time, respondent had done some research on Bissell\u2019s case; however, he had not earned the entire $2,000 and was not entitled to pay himself that amount. Several days later, Bissell signed a fee agreement, and sent it back to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">{\u00b6 8} Respondent believed that he had advised Bissell, as required by DR 1-104(A), that he did not carry malpractice insurance, but he again acknowledged that he did not fully comply with the notification and acknowledgment procedures that the rule requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-9\">{\u00b6 9} Bissell periodically provided additional materials and information to respondent about her case. Respondent, however, did not speak with Bissell after their initial meeting, and he did nothing in her case other than conduct some research and review the materials she supplied. In March 2003, Bissell twice asked respondent to return the $2,200 that she had paid him, but he neither responded nor returned her money. In July 2004, after Bissell filed her grievance with relator, respondent sent a $200 check to reimburse her for the fee \u2022he had retained to pay the costs of her case.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-10\">{\u00b6 10} Respondent stipulated and the board found that in representing Bissell, respondent had violated DR 1-104(A), 6-101(A)(3), 9-102(A) (requiring a lawyer to deposit client funds into one or more identifiable bank accounts), and 9-102(B)(4) (requiring a lawyer to promptly deliver to a client funds in the lawyer\u2019s possession that the client is entitled to receive).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-11\">\n<em>Count III</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b435-12\">{\u00b6 11} Max Nihiser retained respondent in May 2002 to represent him in an employment-related claim. Nihiser paid respondent $500 for his services and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>$200 for costs. Respondent deposited the $200 for costs into his client trust account and deposited the $500 payment into his business operating account, even though he had not yet earned the entire fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">{\u00b6 12} Although respondent believed that he had advised Nihiser that he did not have malpractice insurance, he again acknowledged that he did not fully comply with the DR 1-104(A) notification and acknowledgment procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">{\u00b6 13} Respondent negotiated with Nihiser\u2019s former employer to obtain a settlement of Nihiser\u2019s claims. In December 2002, the employer made a $10,000 settlement offer. Nihiser and respondent discussed the offer and agreed to decline it. Respondent promised Nihiser that he would continue to work on his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">{\u00b6 14} From January 2003 through January 2004, Nihiser tried to contact respondent by telephone. Nihiser also wrote to respondent in October 2003. Respondent did not respond to Nihiser\u2019s call or letter, and he never obtained an acceptable settlement offer or filed suit on Nihiser\u2019s behalf. After Nihiser filed a grievance, respondent reimbursed Nihiser\u2019s $200 payment for costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">{\u00b6 15} Respondent stipulated and the board found that in representing Nihiser respondent violated DR 1-104(A), 6 \u2014 101(A)(3), and 9-102(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-9\">\n<em>Count IV</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b436-10\">{\u00b6 16} In April 1999, respondent agreed to assist the executor in the administration of William Morris\u2019s estate. On April 12, 1999, respondent accepted for safekeeping a lockbox containing the only assets in the estate. The lockbox contained $5,994 in cash, a handgun, and personal papers. Respondent did not deposit the cash into a client trust account or open a bank account for the estate. He instead put the lockbox in a desk drawer in his office.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-11\">{\u00b6 17} On or about June 1,1999, respondent discovered that the lockbox and its contents had been stolen. He filed a police report, but he may not have ever told the executor of the Morris estate about the theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-12\">{\u00b6 18} Respondent never did start probate proceedings in the Morris estate. The executor eventually hired new counsel to administer the estate. Neither the executor nor the new counsel was able to contact respondent to discuss the estate. In 2002, one of the heirs to the Morris estate died before she could inherit because of respondent\u2019s inaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-13\">{\u00b6 19} Respondent stipulated and the board found that respondent had violated DR 1-102(A)(5) (prohibiting conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice) and 6-101(A)(3) in representing the Morris estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>\n<em>Count VI</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">{\u00b6 20} In October 2004, relator received grievances from Bissell, Nihiser, and the executor of the Morris estate. Respondent provided a brief response to the Bissell and Morris grievances but did not respond to the Nihiser grievance. On November 1, 2004, and again on November 22, 2004, relator sent three certified letters of inquiry to respondent concerning these grievances. Respondent received the six letters but did not reply.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">{\u00b6 21} Respondent eventually responded to the grievances against him on January 12, 2005, after relator subpoenaed his appearance.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">{\u00b6 22} Respondent stipulated and the board found that respondent failed to fully cooperate in relator\u2019s disciplinary investigation and violated Gov.Bar R. V(4)(G) (requiring attorneys to cooperate with and assist in any disciplinary investigation).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">Recommended Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b437-9\">{\u00b6 23} In recommending a sanction for respondent\u2019s misconduct, the board weighed the aggravating and mitigating factors listed in Section 10 of the Rules and Regulations Governing Procedure on Complaints and Hearings Before the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline (\u201cBCGD Proc.Reg.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-10\">{\u00b6 24} As aggravating factors, the board found that respondent had engaged in a pattern of neglect and committed multiple offenses, BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(1)(c) and (d). As mitigating factors, the board found that respondent had not acted with a dishonest or selfish motive. The board also found that respondent had no prior record of discipline and that he had eventually cooperated appropriately in the disciplinary process.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-11\">{\u00b6 25} Respondent also provided mitigating medical evidence showing that he suffers from a mental disability. To have a mitigating effect, a mental disability must be supported by all of the following: (1) a diagnosis of the condition by a qualified health-care professional, (2) a professional determination that the mental disability contributed to the misconduct, (3) a sustained period of successful treatment, and (4) a prognosis from a qualified health-care professional that the attorney will be able to return, under specified conditions if necessary, to the competent, ethical professional practice of law. BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2)(g)\u00ae, (ii), (iii), and (iv).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-12\">{\u00b6 26} Respondent has been diagnosed with major depressive disorder, and his psychiatrist, Scott J. Lance, M.D., has been treating him since February 2004. Respondent testified before the panel that his problems likely started in 1996, when he became involved in what turned out to be an overwhelmingly complicated case. He then experienced financial setbacks because of that case. His annual income dropped from approximately $120,000 to $26,000 over the next few <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>years, and by 1998 or 1999, he began to withdraw from the responsibilities of his practice. The death of respondent\u2019s father in 2001 also contributed to respondent\u2019s depressive state. By 2003, respondent\u2019s depression had so affected his marriage that his wife began discussing divorce. Respondent finally sought psychiatric help to save his marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">{\u00b6 27} Dr. Lance testified by deposition that respondent\u2019s depressive disorder significantly impeded his ability to concentrate and focus during the time related to the charges against him and led respondent to routinely procrastinate and avoid tasks. Respondent\u2019s inability to function professionally and personally, according to Dr. Lance, was consistent with respondent\u2019s condition and precipitated the charges against him. Dr. Lance reported that respondent\u2019s symptoms have improved with treatment. In fact, provided that respondent continues with regular appointments and medication for the foreseeable future, Dr. Lance said that respondent is currently capable of practicing law competently, ethically, and with a relatively small likelihood of relapse.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">{\u00b6 28} The panel, however, expressed serious reservations about respondent\u2019s continuing alcohol consumption, especially in combination with his prescribed medications. Steven LaForge, an attorney and respondent\u2019s friend, testified that although he had never personally noticed signs of respondent\u2019s alcohol abuse, other attorneys had expressed their concern about a possible problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">{\u00b6 29} Respondent advised the board that he had consulted in October 2004 with a representative of the Ohio Lawyers Assistance Program (\u201cOLAP\u201d), who told him that he did not need to enter an OLAP recovery contract. Respondent stated that he did not believe it was necessary for him to completely .avoid alcohol, but he also reported that he had cut back on alcohol at his doctor\u2019s recommendation. Respondent admitted, however, that he still has \u201ca drink or a beer before dinner, and a glass of wine with dinner, and maybe something in the evening after that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b438-8\">{\u00b6 30} Respondent testified that with his return to public employment his financial situation is also much improved. He offered to pay $5,994 in restitution to the Morris estate and $2,000 to Bissell. Respondent contended that restitution was not necessary to Nihiser because his legal work had cost more than the advanced $500 fee, and Nihiser had retained new counsel to timely pursue his case. Because his research had shown that Ramsey\u2019s case was not actionable and had cost more than the advanced $1,500 fee, respondent also contended that Ramsey had not suffered financially.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-9\">{\u00b6 31} Finally, respondent submitted LaForge\u2019s testimony and numerous character letters from local judges, county commissioners, and colleagues to establish his professional competence and integrity apart from his misconduct. The board found that respondent had an excellent personal and professional reputation in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>his community, a mitigating factor under BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2)(e), and that he genuinely regretted his misdeeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">{\u00b6 32} Relator advocated a one-year suspension of respondent\u2019s license to practice, with the suspension stayed on conditions involving monitoring and restitution. Respondent also sought a stay of any suspension and asked for a short suspension period. Adopting the panel\u2019s report, the board recommended that respondent be suspended from the practice of law for one year, with the entire period stayed, and that he serve a two-year probation under the conditions that he (1) continue with all aspects of his treatment with Dr. Lance or another qualified psychiatrist, (2) provide quarterly psychiatric reports to relator on his progress, (3) pay $1,500 in restitution to Robin Bissell, and (4) pay $5,994 in restitution to the Morris estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">Review</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">{\u00b6 33} We agree that respondent violated DR 1-102(A)(5), 1-104(A), 6-101(A)(3), 9-102(A), and 9-102(B)(4) and Gov.Bar R. V(4)(G), as found by the board. We are not convinced, however, that respondent is currently capable of returning to the competent and ethical practice of law. We therefore exercise our authority in disciplinary cases to independently determine the appropriate sanction, see <em>Ohio State Bar Assn. v. Reid </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 327, 708 N.E.2d 193, paragraph one of the syllabus, and <em>Mahoning Cty. Bar Assn. v. Sinclair, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 65, 2004-Ohio-7014, 822 N.E.2d 360, and impose a two-year suspension, with one year stayed on the recommended conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">{\u00b6 34} Respondent is taking a series of antidepressant medications, including a prescription that is regulated for its addictive qualities. Notwithstanding this, -respondent has persisted in drinking beer, wine, and perhaps even more potent alcoholic beverages that also act as depressants. More troubling still is the fact that respondent appears largely unconcerned about the perils this drug and alcohol use potentially poses to the effective representation of his clients.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-9\">{\u00b6 35} Under all the circumstances of this case, we share the board\u2019s unease about respondent\u2019s continued alcohol consumption. The two-year probation period suggested by the board, therefore, is warranted to ensure monitoring of respondent\u2019s medical treatment and the effect of his condition, even if it does not include alcohol abuse, on his legal practice. See Gov.Bar R. V(9). Moreover, to ensure that respondent\u2019s condition is adequately managed and that he will not again abandon his clients\u2019 interests as a result of his condition, we order that respondent serve a one-year actual suspension from the Ohio bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-10\">{\u00b6 36} Respondent is therefore suspended from the practice of law in Ohio for two years. The second year of the suspension is stayed on conditions. During the stayed suspension, respondent shall (1) continue with all aspects of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>treatment with Dr. Lance or another qualified psychiatrist, (2) provide quarterly psychiatric reports to relator on his progress, (3) pay $1,500, with interest at the judgment rate, in restitution to Robin Bissell, and (4) pay $5,994, with interest at the judgment rate, in restitution to the Morris estate. Moreover, if reinstated, respondent shall serve, as an additional condition of the stay, a two-year probation pursuant to Gov.Bar R. V(9) that includes continued monitoring of his medical treatment and monitoring of his law practice to ensure his return as a competent and ethical practitioner. If respondent violates the terms of the stay or probation, the stay shall be lifted and respondent shall serve the entire two-year actual suspension.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b440-8\">Jonathan E.
