The issue presented raises an important question of search-and-seizure jurisprudence and should be resolved on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-11\">{\u00b6 3} Richard Eash was convicted after a jury trial of one count of importuning, one count of public indecency, one count of sexual imposition, one count of kidnapping, 48 counts of illegal use of a minor in nudity-oriented material, two counts of attempted illegal use of a minor in nudity-oriented material, and four counts of pandering sexually oriented material involving a minor. The evidence supporting the charges of nudity-oriented and sexually oriented material consisted of various computer files of child pornography and associated records discovered after a search of Eash\u2019s computer. That evidence was discovered after a search warrant was executed at Eash\u2019s home. Eash was identified as a suspect in several incidents involving sexual improprieties and young girls after an investigation into these incidents in the Urbana, Ohio area.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-12\">{If 4} Eash appealed his conviction, arguing in part that the computer files introduced as evidence should have been suppressed. The Court of Appeals for the Second District agreed. <em>State v. Eash, </em>Champaign App. No. 03-CA-34, 2005-Ohio-3749, 2005 WL 1713429. The court of appeals held that the affidavit used to support the search warrant did not establish probable cause to search the computer on which child pornography was eventually discovered. Id. at \u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-13\">{\u00b6 5} The affidavit used to obtain the search warrant in this case described repeated acts of sexual improprieties directed against adolescent girls in Urbana, Ohio. Three incidents were described in detail in the affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-14\">{\u00b6 6} The search warrant was finally sought after the victim of the last and most severe incident managed to escape from a vehicle after being fondled and nearly raped in January 2003. The victim gave a partial license plate number as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1237\">*1237</page-number>well as a description of the perpetrator. A police investigation revealed that the vehicle\u2019s license plate and description matched those of a vehicle owned by Eash.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-6\">{\u00b6 7} Urbana police detectives realized that Eash\u2019s description matched that reported in other instances of public indecency and vulgar comments directed at adolescent girls near and around the Urbana High School. In one of the instances, the 11-year-old victim had given a nearly identical description of the perpetrator and the vehicle used after an incident in December 2002. In another instance, the 15-year-old victim of an incident occurring in September 2002 identified Eash as the perpetrator in a photo lineup, after his identity had been discovered by use of the partial license plate number.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-7\">{\u00b6 8} These factual details were used by the Urbana police officer in the affidavit seeking a search warrant. The search warrant authorized a search of Eash\u2019s house for specific evidence relating to the descriptions given by the victims above. The search warrant also authorized seizure of \u201cany computers, central processing units, all data drives, hard drives, floppy drives, optical drives, tape drives, digital audio tape drives, and/or any other internal or external storage devices as magnetic tapes and/or discs\u201d so that \u201c[a]ny information contained within all seized computer hardware and software [may] be examined for presence of child pornography and/or child erotica.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b859-8\">{\u00b6 9} At a hearing before the trial court on Eash\u2019s motion to suppress, two Urbana Police Department officers testified. Officer Brian Cordial, the affiant, indicated that his decision to include the computer and other digital storage media among the items to be searched was based on his personal police experience and upon communications with Officer Steve Molton, who had undergone significant training in computer crimes and child abuse. Officer Molton noted that it is common knowledge in the law-enforcement community that persons who commit sex crimes against children are frequently purveyors of child pornography, which is most commonly trafficked in digital form.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-9\">{\u00b6 10} Crim.R. 41(C) states: \u201cA warrant shall issue * * * only on an affidavit or affidavits sworn to before a judge of a court of record and establishing the grounds for issuing the warrant.\u201d This rule is the implementation of protections contained in the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution (\u201cno warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation * * *\u201d) and the nearly identical provision in Section 14, Article I of the Ohio Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-10\">{\u00b6 11} The issue presented in a case such as this, where the sufficiency of the affidavit in support of the warrant is challenged, is whether the affidavit contains sufficient information to support a \u201cfair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place.\u201d <em>State v. George </em>(1989), 45 Ohio St.3d 325, 544 N.E.2d 640, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1238\">*1238</page-number>{\u00b6 12} The state conceded at trial and before the court of appeals that the affidavit fails to expressly identify the causal connection between the described activities in the vehicle and the contents of E ash\u2019s home computer. None of the background about Officer Cordial\u2019s experience and consultation with Officer Molton or any of the information about Officer Molton\u2019s extensive experience and training made it into the affidavit submitted in support of the warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">{\u00b6 13} The state, however, argued that the good-faith exception should be applied because the police officers acted in good faith that the judge\u2019s probable-cause determination was correct. <em>United States v. Peltier </em>(1975), 422 U.S. 531, 95 S.Ct. 2313, 45 L.Ed.2d 374; <em>United States v. Leon </em>(1984), 468 U.S. 897, 104 S.Ct. 3405, 82 L.Ed.2d 677.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-6\">{\u00b6 14} The court of appeals rejected this argument, however, noting that the good-faith exception is unavailable when the underlying affidavit in support of the warrant itself lacks probable cause. <em>Leon, </em>468 U.S. at 915, 104 S.Ct. 3405, 82 L.Ed.2d 677. The court of appeals, citing its own decision in <em>State v. Klosterman </em>(1996), 114 Ohio App.3d 327, 332, 683 N.E.2d 100, held that when determining whether probable cause exists to support the affidavit, only the information contained within the affidavit may be considered. As a result, the police officers\u2019 training, expertise, and internal discussions were not considered and were determined not to be relevant to the proceedings. Other appellate districts have adopted the court of appeals\u2019 position as espoused in <em>Klosterman. State v. Gales </em>(2001), 143 Ohio App.3d 55, 757 N.E.2d 390; <em>State v. Brown, </em>Summit App. No. 22770, 2006-Ohio-1905, 2006 WL 1009007.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-7\">{\u00b6 15} However, that position is directly contrary to the position adopted by the Court of Appeals for the Twelfth District, which extends the probable-cause determination to information adduced at the suppression hearing. <em>State v. Wesseler </em>(Feb. 17, 1998), Butler App. No. CA96-07-131, 1998 WL 65688; <em>State v. O\u2019Connor, </em>Butler App. No. CA2001-08-195, 2002-Ohio-4122, 2002 WL 1832865.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-8\">{\u00b6 16} The instant issue has received disparate treatment among the federal courts of appeals and the individual states. Rather than recount each court\u2019s approach, a review of Professor John E. Taylor\u2019s article Using Suppression Hearing Testimony to Prove Good Faith Under <em>United States v. Leon </em>(2005), 54 U.Kan.L.Rev. 155, is more instructive. Taylor\u2019s article contains a comprehensive discussion of the relevant splits after the United States Supreme Court decided <em>Leon.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b860-9\">{\u00b6 17} The massive confusion among courts on what appears to be a straightforward issue is a strong call for this court to reach a resolution on this important determination in Ohio. Our failure to address this issue continues the inconsistent treatment of police searches and the resulting prosecutions supported by uninten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1239\">*1239</page-number>tionally incomplete affidavits in support of a warrant. This court\u2019s decision to dismiss this case as having been improvidently accepted is incorrect.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b861-7\">Nick A.
