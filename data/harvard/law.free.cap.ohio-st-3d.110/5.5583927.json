R.C. 1345.02 and 1345.03. A consumer has a cause of action and is entitled to relief for any violation of the CSPA. R.C. 1345.09. A consumer may, in an individual action, rescind the transaction or recover damages for a violation of the CSPA. R.C. 1345.09(A). However, if the violation is an act or practice that was declared to be deceptive or unconscionable by a rule adopted by the Attorney General before the consumer transaction on which the action is based, or if the violation is an act or practice that was determined by a court to violate the CSPA and the court\u2019s decision was available for public inspection in accordance with R.C. 1345.05(A)(3) before the consumer transaction, the consumer may seek additional relief, including damages or other appropriate relief in a class action under Civ.R. 23. R.C. 1345.09(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">{\u00b6 2} We must determine how similar the defendant\u2019s conduct must be to the conduct that was previously determined to be deceptive in order for a consumer to qualify for class-action certification under R.C. 1345.09(B) for a violation of the CSPA. For the reasons that follow, we hold that a consumer may qualify for class-action certification under Ohio\u2019s CSPA only if the defendant\u2019s alleged violation of the Act is substantially similar to an act or practice previously declared to be deceptive by one of the methods identified in R.C. 1345.09(B). Because the plaintiffs\u2019 claims in this case did not meet that standard, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">{\u00b6 3} The plaintiffs-appellees, Catherine Marrone and Greg and Eva Phillips, filed class-action complaints against defendant-appellant, Philip Morris USA, Inc. (\u201cPMI\u201d), individually and on behalf of Ohio residents who purchased and smoked Virginia Slims Lights and Marlboro Lights cigarettes. They alleged fraud, unjust enrichment, and violations of the CSPA related to PMI\u2019s manufacture and sale of the \u201clight\u201d cigarettes. In particular, the plaintiffs alleged that PMI falsely represented the cigarettes as light to mislead smokers.into believing that the cigarettes delivered lower tar and nicotine and therefore were safer than their regular counterparts, Virginia Slims and Marlboros.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-8\">{\u00b6 <em>4} </em>The plaintiffs also alleged that PMI failed to disclose that the light cigarettes delivered lower tar and nicotine levels only when tested by a machine, but not when smoked by consumers. They alleged that the smoker\u2019s lips or fingers covered or blocked microscopic vent holes on the filter of the cigarettes under normal use, thereby negating any benefits of the design. The plaintiffs also alleged that PMI intentionally manipulated the design and content of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>cigarettes to maximize, rather than lower, the amount of nicotine actually delivered during normal smoking.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">{\u00b6 5} The plaintiffs moved for class certification. The trial court determined that they met the prerequisites to a class action under Civ.R. 23. The court certified a limited class of consumers from a six-county area in northeast Ohio on the CSPA claims only.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The trial court did not address R.C. 1345.09(B) or identify a rule adopted by the Attorney General or a court determination that these alleged acts or practices constituted deceptive or unconscionable practices prior to the alleged conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">{\u00b6 6} PMI appealed the judgment certifying the class. The court of appeals concluded that the plaintiffs had demonstrated that there had been prior determinations that the specific alleged conduct of PMI constituted a deceptive act or practice. The court relied on cases cited by the plaintiffs in which the defendant had represented a product to be of a certain quality or to have certain attributes that it did not: <em>Amato v. Gen. Motors Corp. </em>(1982), 11 Ohio App.3d 124, 11 OBR 203, 463 N.E.2d 625; <em>State ex rel. Fisher v. Natl. Information Group </em>(Oct. 19, 1994), Franklin C.P. No. 93CVH09-6323; <em>State ex rel. Celebrezze v. Hi-Lo Oil Co., Inc. </em>(July 31, 1985), Franklin C.P. No. 85-CV-01-518; and <em>Brown v. Introductions Internatl., Inc. </em>(Sept. 29, 1975), Lucas C.P. 74-2529. The appellate court affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment certifying the class.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">{\u00b6 7} This cause is before this court upon our acceptance of a discretionary appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">{\u00b6 8} In order to maintain a class action, plaintiffs must meet the prerequisites set forth in Civ.R. 23. The appellate court affirmed the trial court\u2019s determination that the plaintiffs had satisfied the Civ.R. 23 elements necessary for a class action.' That determination is not before us, and this opinion does not address whether the requirements of Civ.R. 23 were met. We address only the narrow issue of whether defendant had sufficient notice for purposes of R.C. 1345.09(B) that its alleged conduct was deceptive.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-9\">{\u00b6 9} R.C. 1345.09(B) provides that a consumer may qualify for class-action status only when a supplier acted in the face of prior notice that its conduct was deceptive or unconscionable. The prior notice may be in the form of (1) a rule adopted by the Attorney General under R.C. 1345.05(B)(2) or (2) a court decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>made available for public inspection by the Attorney General under R.C. 1345.05(A)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">{\u00b6 10} PMI argues that the acts or practices described in the prior notice must be industry- or conduct-specific for the notice to be meaningful and to give a supplier fair warning of conduct that violates the CSPA. According to PMI, no court ruling or Attorney General rule satisfied that requirement here. PMI contends that the cigarette industry is highly regulated by the federal government, and, therefore, generic or nonspecific rules or court decisions do not provide notice for purposes of R.C. 1345.09(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">{\u00b6 11} The plaintiffs, however, contend that R.C. 1345.09(B) refers only to \u201can act or practice\u201d and does not require specificity. They argue that the prior notice need only be sufficient to put the offending party on notice. The plaintiffs argue that <em>State ex rel. Celebrezze v. Hi-Lo Oil, Inc., </em>Franklin C.P. No. 85-CV-01-518, <em>Amato v. Gen. Motors Corp., </em>11 Ohio App.3d 124, 11 OBR 203, 463 N.E.2d 625, and Ohio Adm.Code 109:4-3-10 gave notice to PMI that its manufacturing and labeling of \u201clight\u201d cigarettes violated Ohio law.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">{\u00b6 12} As discussed below, the conduct described in these cases is not substantially similar to PMI\u2019s alleged conduct, and the Administrative Code section describes a generic prohibition. Consequently, they do not provide prior notice to PMI of deceptive and unconscionable acts or practices for purposes of R.C. 1345.09(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">A. Publicly Available Court Decisions</p>\n<p id=\"b320-9\">{\u00b6 13} Prior notice may be in the form of \u201can act or practice determined by a court of this state to violate section 1345.02 or 1345.03 of the Revised Code and * * * made available for public inspection under division (A)(3) of section 1345.05 of the Revised Code.\u201d R.C. 1345.09(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-10\">{\u00b6 14} R.C. 1345.05(A)(3) provides that the Attorney General must \u201c[m]ake available for public inspection all rules * * * together with all judgments, including supporting opinions, by courts of this state * * * determining that specific acts or practices violate section 1345.02 or 1345.03 of the Revised Code.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b320-11\">{\u00b6 15} <em>State ex rel. Celebrezze v. Hi-Lo Oil, </em>Franklin C.P. No. 85-CV-01-518, involved a defendant that was representing to consumers that it was selling two different grades of gasoline from two different pumps when in fact all the gasoline came from one underground tank. The trial court determined that this was a deceptive and unconscionable practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-12\">{\u00b6 16} <em>Amato v. Gen. Motors Corp. </em>involved an automobile manufacturer that allegedly sold Oldsmobile automobiles that contained engines manufactured by its Chevrolet division. The trial court certified <em>Amato </em>as a class action, finding prior notice in administrative rules that generically prohibited advertising that did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>clearly and conspicuously state any material omissions or modifications and a rule that forbade bait-and-switch tactics. <em>Amato, </em>11 Ohio App.3d at 131, 11 OBR 203, 463 N.E.2d 625. The <em>Amato </em>court decided that, although the rules did not mention motor-vehicle parts, they were \u201csufficient to put a reasonable person on notice of the prohibition.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">{\u00b6 17} The appellate court held that these court decisions were \u201csufficient to constitute prior determinations, within the meaning of R.C. 1345.09(B).\u201d <em>Marrone v. Philip Morris USA, Inc., </em>Medina App. No. 03CA0120-M, 2004-Ohio-4874, \u00b6 12. We disagree. These cases did not involve the cigarette or tobacco industries. The industries and conduct in these cases were too dissimilar to PMI\u2019s to have afforded PMI advance notice that its acts or practices had been declared deceptive under the CSPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">{\u00b6 18} Other courts have required that the prior determination be specific and that it involve conduct similar to the alleged conduct at issue. In <em>Mihailoff v. Ionna </em>(May 6, 1987), Hamilton App. No. C-860040, 1987 WL 10889, the court concluded that a prior case involving the sale and repair of household appliances was insufficient notice for purposes of R.C. 1345.09(B) to persons in the real estate business. The court reasoned that \u201cthe specific wrongful acts and practices in the appliance business are not uniformly relevant in operative detail to acts and practices in the sale and improvement of real estate.\u201d Thus, the court concluded, the prior case did not give \u201cfair warning in advance about deceptive or unconscionable acts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">{\u00b6 19} In <em>Lewis v. ACB Business Servs., Inc. </em>(C.A.6, 1998), 135 F.3d 389, the court rejected as prior notice cases involving conduct that was too dissimilar to the conduct at issue. The court reasoned that \u201c[t]o read [the cases] as broadly as Lewis suggests and without reference to the specific acts in those cases would allow the recovery * * * under the [CSPA] whenever there is any arguable misstatement of fact, a result the Ohio courts and legislature surely did not intend.\u201d Id. at 405.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">{\u00b6 20} In <em>Nicols v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. </em>(Aug. 9, 2000), Summit C.P. No. CV 99-11-4539, a case against another cigarette manufacturer, the trial court refused to certify the case as a class action because the plaintiff failed to satisfy the prerequisite of prior notice in R.C. 1345.09(B). Specifically, the trial court rejected the argument that Ohio Adm.Code 109:4-3-02 and 109:4-3-10 provided prior notice because neither one sets forth a specific act or conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-9\">{\u00b6 21} We believe that these cases correctly interpret R.C. 1345.09(B). Cases that involve industries and conduct very different from the defendant\u2019s do not provide meaningful notice of specific acts or practices that violate the CSPA. Therefore, the plaintiffs have cited no publicly available court decision that would satisfy R.C. 1345.09(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>B. Rule Adopted by Attorney General</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">(\u00b6 22} Prior notice may also be in the form of \u201can act or practice declared to be deceptive or unconscionable by rule adopted under division (B)(2) of section 1345.05 of the Revised Code.\u201d R.C. 1345.09(B). R.C. 1345.05(B)(2) authorizes the Attorney General to \u201c[a]dopt, amend, and repeal substantive rules defining with reasonable specificity acts or practices that violate sections 1345.02 and 1345.03 of the Revised Code.\u201d In so doing, the Attorney General must give \u201cdue consideration and great weight\u201d to the \u201cfederal trade commission orders, trade regulation rules and guides, and the federal courts\u2019 interpretations of subsection 45(a)(1) of the \u2018Federal Trade Commission Act,\u2019 38 Stat. 717 (1914), 15 U.S.C.A. 41, as amended.\u201d R.C. 1345.05(B)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">{\u00b6 23} The plaintiffs rely on Ohio Adm.Code 109:4-3-10, which states that it is a deceptive act or practice for a supplier to make any representations in the absence of a reasonable basis in fact. However, as did the court in <em>Nicols v. R.J. Reynolds, </em>Summit C.P. No. CV 99 \u201411\u20144539, we hold that this rule is insufficient to provide prior notice under R.C. 1345.09(B) because it does not refer to any particular act or practice. A general rule is not sufficient to put a reasonable person on notice of the prohibition against a specific act or practice. To permit a generic rule to constitute prior notice for purposes of R.C. 1345.09(B) would allow <em>any </em>previous determination of a deceptive act or practice to qualify as prior notice for any subsequent alleged deceptive act or practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">{\u00b6 24} \u201cFor class certification to be proper, the prior decision or previously promulgated rule must have put the defendant on notice that the specific conduct at issue violated\u201d the Act. <em>Delahunt v. Cytodyne Technologies </em>(S.D.Ohio 2003), 241 F.Supp.2d 827, 837. The question before us is what degree of similarity is necessary for purposes of R.C. 1345.09(B). We hold that there must be a substantial similarity between a defendant\u2019s alleged violation of the Act and an act or practice previously declared deceptive by either a rule promulgated by the Attorney General or a court decision that was publicly available when the alleged violation occurred. \u201cSubstantial similarity\u201d means a similarity not in every detail, but in essential circumstances or conditions. See <em>W.F. Corbin &amp; Co. v. United States </em>(C.A.6, 1910), 181 F. 296, 301, citing 1 Wigmore on Evidence, Section 442. \u201cSubstantial similarity\u201d is the standard used in a variety of legal contexts, but perhaps most applicable here is the use of that standard in products-liability cases when determining whether to admit evidence of past incidents to demonstrate that a defendant had notice that its product was dangerous or defective. <em>Renfro v. Black </em>(1990), 52 Ohio St.3d 27, 31, 556 N.E.2d 150, citing <em>McKinnon v. Skil Corp. </em>(C.A.1, 1981), 638 F.2d 270, 277; <em>Drake v. Caterpillar Tractor Co. </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 346, 349-350, 15 OBR 468, 474 N.E.2d 291 (Holmes, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>{\u00b6 25} The acts or practices determined to be deceptive in <em>Celebrezze </em>and <em>Amato </em>are not substantially similar to the allegations against PMI. Ohio Adm. Code 109:4-3-10 is a generic prohibition that does not refer to any specific act or practice. Consequently, the plaintiffs failed to identify any prior rule or court - decision that would have put PMI on notice that its conduct violated the CSPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">{\u00b6 26} The absence of prior rules or court decisions that address the cigarette industry may be due in part to the comprehensive regulations of the industry by the Federal Trade Commission (\u201cFTC\u201d). Ohio\u2019s consumer-protection laws defer to FTC pronouncements, R.C. 1345.11(B) and 1345.05(B)(2), and such deference is particularly appropriate here, given the expertise that the FTC has developed in the past 70 years of regulating the tobacco industry, see <em>Flanagan v. Altria Group, Inc. </em>(Oct. 25, 2005), E.D.Mich.S.D. No. 05-71697, 2005 WL 2769010, *3. Part of that comprehensive regulation calls for the FTC to oversee the testing methods and advertisements that are implicated by the plaintiffs\u2019 claims.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">{\u00b6 27} As other courts have recognized, the FTC persuaded all cigarette manufacturers to agree to use the identical testing method for measuring the amount of tar and nicotine in cigarettes. See, e.g., <em>Flanagan, </em>2005 WL 2769010 at *3-4. That testing method is the same test that the putative class complains of here. It is well established that the FTC recognized that no one test could accurately determine the amount of tar and nicotine to which an \u201caverage\u201d smoker would be exposed, but it also recognized that if one standardized test was used by all cigarette manufacturers, then consumers could compare the tar and nicotine amounts of different brands. See <em>Price v. Philip Morris, Inc. </em>(2005), 219 Ill.2d 182, 189-190, 848 N.E.2d 1 (\u201cThe record is clear that both the FTC and the cigarette manufacturers were aware [at the time the FTC adopted the standard method (\u2018the FTC method\u2019) ] that no method of measurement, including the FTC method, could accurately predict the actual exposure of individual smokers who smoked any particular brand of cigarette\u201d); <em>Virden v. Altria Group, Inc. </em>(N.D.W.Va.2004), 304 F.Supp.2d 832, 839, quoting FTC News Release (Aug. 1, 1967), \u201cFTC to Begin Cigarette Testing\u201d (\u201cThe FTC further noted that, because \u2018[n]o two human smokers smoke in the same way,\u2019 the \u2018FTC Method\u2019 was not an attempt \u2018to gauge the test to the amount of smoke, or tar and nicotine, which the \u201caverage\u201d smoker will draw from any particular cigarette\u2019 \u201d); <em>Watson v. Philip </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number><em>Morris Cos., Inc. </em>(C.A.8, 2005), 420 F.3d 852, 855 (\u201cFrom its initial development, the FTC was aware that the testing method did not measure the amount of tar or nicotine that an individual smoker may receive. The purpose of the test was not to replicate human smoking but to provide a basis for comparison\u201d); <em>Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp. v. Fed. Trade Comm. </em>(C.A.6, 1983), 710 F.2d 1165, 1168 (\u201cThe FTC method was never intended to provide precise measurements of \u2018tar\u2019 and nicotine delivery to each smoker because consumers smoke cigarettes in different fashions. Instead, the tests were designed to provide consumers with figures by which to compare the many brands of cigarettes on the market\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">{\u00b6 28} Despite its knowledge that the test did not accurately reflect the amount of tar and nicotine a smoker would consume, the FTC required that the measurements obtained through such testing be reported in all cigarette advertisements. <em>Watson, </em>420 F.3d at 858-860; <em>Flanagan, </em>2005 WL 2769010 at *5. And although the FTC is well aware of the years of litigation and debate over cigarette manufacturers\u2019 marketing strategies, to date it has not directed manufacturers to refrain from using quantifier adjectives \u2014 terms such as \u201clow,\u201d \u201clower,\u201d and \u201creduced\u201d \u2014 in describing tar and nicotine levels in advertisements for their cigarettes. <em>Watson, </em>420 F.3d at 861-862; <em>Flanagan, </em>2005 WL 2769010 at *3-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">{\u00b6 29} Although it appears that the FTC has neither permitted nor forbidden characterizations like \u201clow\u201d tar, <em>Flanagan, </em>2005 WL 2769010 at *4-5, the information about average tar and nicotine levels used in the advertisements comes directly from testing practices that are \u201crequired or specifically permitted by federal trade commission orders [and] trade regulation rules and guides.\u201d See R.C. 1345.11(B). Because the cigarette industry is highly regulated by the federal government, PMI was obligated to follow federal mandates and standards for light cigarettes.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">{\u00b6 30} The ultimate question in this litigation is whether, notwithstanding the FTC\u2019s imprimatur on those testing methods, PMI used the data to deliberately deceive consumers into believing that Marlboro Lights and Virginia Slims Lights are safer than other cigarettes. That issue is not before us, and our opinion should not be read to suggest that we find that the conduct at issue was deceptive or otherwise violated Ohio law. The plaintiffs may be entitled to pursue class-action relief under Civ.R. 23; however, they have failed to identify any prior rule or court decision that would entitle them to pursue CSPA relief under R.C. 1345.09(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>{\u00b6 31} In conclusion, we hold that the court of appeals erred in determining that there had been a prior determination that conduct sufficiently similar to the alleged acts of PMI violated R.C. 1345.02 or 1345.03. We hold that to satisfy R.C. 1345.09(B), a plaintiff must show that the defendant\u2019s alleged conduct is substantially similar to an act or practice that was previously declared to be deceptive. The plaintiffs do not meet that standard to qualify for class-action certification under R.C. 1345.09(B). Therefore, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b325-6\">Moyer, C.J., O\u2019Connor and O\u2019Donnell, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b325-7\">Grady and Lanzinger, JJ., concur in part and dissent in part.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b325-8\">Pfeifer, J., dissents.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b325-9\">Thomas J.

See 7A, Part I, Uniform Laws Annotated, Business and Financial Laws (Master Ed.2002), Uniform Consumer Sales Practices Act, 71. A stated purpose of the Uniform Act is \u201cto make state regulation of consumer sales practices not inconsistent with the policies of the Federal Trade Commission Act relating to consumer protection.\u201d Section 1(4), Uniform Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-13\">{\u00b6 34} Like Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, Section 45, Title 15, U.S.Code, Section 3(a) of the Uniform Act prohibits a supplier from committing a \u201cdeceptive act or practice\u201d in consumer transactions. Unlike the Federal Trade Commission Act, however, the Uniform Act allows consumers to bring private actions for relief arising from violations committed by suppliers. Section 11, Uniform Act. Ohio\u2019s Act contains like provisions at R.C. 1345.02 and 1345.03, which prohibit \u201cunfair or deceptive\u201d and \u201cunconscionable\u201d acts or practices, respectively, and at R.C. 1345.09(A) and (B), which confer private rights of relief on affected consumers.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>{\u00b6 35} The Uniform Act also directs a state\u2019s \u201cEnforcing Authority\u201d to maintain a digest of judgments rendered by courts of the state finding that particular acts or practices are unfair or deceptive. Section 5(a)(5), Uniform Act. The enforcing authority is also directed to promulgate rules prohibiting acts or practices that are deceptive. Section 6(b), Uniform Act. This rule-making authority corresponds to the rule-making powers conferred on the Federal Trade Commission by the Wheeler-Lea Act, which made amendments to the Federal Trade Commission Act in 1938. Section 45, Title 15, U.S.Code; Chapter 49, Section 3, 52 Stat. Ill (1938).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">{\u00b6 36} Under R.C. 1345.05, the Attorney General of Ohio is the enforcing authority of the Consumer Sales Practices Act. R.C. 1345.05(A)(3) mandates that the Attorney General shall make available for public inspection \u201call judgments * * * by courts of this state * * * determining that specific acts or practices violate section 1345.02 or 1345.03 of the Revised Code.\u201d The Attorney General maintains a \u201cPublic Inspection File\u201d containing a number of such judgments. R.C. 1345.05(B)(2), which is permissive, further authorizes the Attorney General to \u201c[a]dopt, amend, and repeal substantive rules defining with reasonable specificity acts or practices that violate sections 1345.02 and 1345.03 of the Revised Code.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">{\u00b6 37} R.C. 1345.09(A) permits consumers to seek awards of actual damages \u201cin an individual action.\u201d Subsection (B) of R.C. 1345.09 states:</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">{\u00b6 38} \u201cWhere the violation was an act or practice declared to be deceptive or unconscionable by rule adopted under division (B)(2) of section 1345.05 of the Revised Code before the consumer transaction on which the action is based, or an act or practice determined by a court of this state to violate section 1345.02 or 1345.03 of the Revised Code and committed after the decision containing the determination has been made available for public inspection under division (A)(3) of section 1345.05 of the Revised Code, the consumer may rescind the transaction or recover, but not in a class action, three times the amount of his actual damages <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>or two hundred dollars, whichever is greater, or recover damages or other appropriate relief in a class action under Civil Rule 23, as amended.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">{\u00b6 39} The majority opinion reverses the class certification that the trial court ordered and imposes a \u201csubstantially similar\u201d test, requiring consumers to show that an alleged act or practice is substantially similar to one that was previously declared to violate R.C. 1345.02 or 1345.03.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">{\u00b6 40} While it is somewhat vague, the substantially-similar test is workable in relation to the judgments that the Attorney General includes in his Public Inspection File because an act or practice can readily be compared to the specific act or practice the prior judgment involved. The test is necessarily industry- and product-specific and in that respect corresponds in concept to the Federal Trade Commission\u2019s industry-guide program. A guide explains to members of an industry how the Federal Trade Commission Act applies to prohibit specific acts or practices. Currently, Federal Trade Commission guides identify unfair or deceptive acts or practices in 27 specific industries. See, generally, 1 Kanwit, Federal Trade Commission (2001), Sections 6.01-6.03. Pertinent to the acts or practices that this litigation involves are the Federal Trade Commission\u2019s \u201cCigarette Advertising Guides,\u201d which were promulgated in 1955.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">{\u00b6 41} The substantially-similar test, because it necessarily implies a comparison to a specific prior act or practice, does not so readily apply to rules promulgated by the Attorney General pursuant to R.C. 1345.05(B)(2), which are instead generic and not limited to specific products or industries, and need only \u201cdefin[e] with reasonable specificity acts or practices that violate sections 1345.02 and 1345.03 of the Revised Code.\u201d Such rules typically identify particular species of acts or practices that violate R.C. 1345.02 or 1345.03, without specifying a product \u00f3r industry the consumer transaction must involve.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">{\u00b6 42} In enacting R.C. 1345.09(B), the General Assembly created an enforcement mechanism, one not only of monetary benefit to consumers but also designed to achieve the purposes of Ohio\u2019s Consumer Sales Practices Act. This court has held:</p>\n<p id=\"b327-9\">{\u00b6 43} \u201cIn construing [R.C. 1345.09 and 1345.10] we are guided by the longstanding rule \u2018 * * * that the General Assembly is not presumed to do a vain or useless thing, and that when language is inserted in a statute, it is inserted to accomplish- some definite purpose.\u201d \u2019 <em>Brown v. Martinelli </em>(1981), 66 Ohio St.2d 45, 50 [20 O.O.3d 38, 419 N.E.2d 1081, quoting <em>State ex rel. Cleveland Elec. Illum. Co. v. Euclid </em>(1959), 169 Ohio St. 476, 479, 8 O.O.2d 480, 159 N.E.2d 756]. \u2018The General Assembly will not be presumed to have intended to enact a law producing unreasonable or absurd consequences. It is the duty of the courts, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>if the language of a statute fairly permits or unless restrained by the clear language thereof, so to construe the statute as to avoid such a result.\u2019 <em>Canton v. Imperial Bowling Lanes </em>(1968), 16 Ohio St.2d 47 [45 O.O.2d 327, 242 N.E.2d 566], paragraph four of the syllabus.\u201d <em>Celebrezze v. Hughes </em>(1985), 18 Ohio St.3d 71, 74, 18 OBR 102, 479 N.E.2d 886.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">{\u00b6 44} As applied to acts or practices that allegedly violate generic but reasonably specific rules promulgated by the Attorney General pursuant to R.C. 1345.05(B)(2), the substantially-similar test imposes an unworkable comparative analysis that effectively prevents consumers from using those generic rules as a basis for the relief that R.C. 1345.09(B) authorizes. The General Assembly would not have made rule violations a basis for R.C. 1345.09(B) actions had it intended that a substantially-similar test be used. Therefore, I dissent from the majority\u2019s decision to that extent.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">{\u00b6 45} In seeking class certification for alleged Consumer Sales Practices Act violations by Philip Morris, Inc., appellees rely on two prior judgments contained in the Attorney General\u2019s Public Inspection File and a rule promulgated by the Attorney General.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">{\u00b6 46} Appellees rely on <em>Amato v. Gen. Motors Corp. </em>(1982), 11 Ohio App.3d 124, 11 OBR 203, 463 N.E.2d 625, and <em>State ex rel. Celebrezze v. Hi-Lo Oil Co., Inc. </em>(July 31, 1985), Franklin C.P. No. 85-CV-01-518. In <em>Amato, </em>the defendant installed Chevrolet engines in its Oldsmobile cars. In <em>Hi-Lo, </em>a gasoline retailer sold both premium- and regular-priced gasoline from a common underground tank. Appellees draw an analogy between those acts or practices and Philip Morris\u2019s alleged practice of putting the same tobacco in both its regular and \u201clight\u201d Marlboro and Virginia Slims brands. However, Philip Morris\u2019s alleged act or practice involves a wholly different product and industry than were involved in <em>Amato </em>and <em>Hi-Lo. </em>Therefore, applying the substantially-similar test, neither of those prior judgments is a basis for class certification.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">{\u00b6 47} Appellees also rely on Ohio Adm.Code 109:4-3-10. That rule, promulgated by the Attorney General, prohibits failure to have substantiation for factual claims made concerning a supplier\u2019s product or service. The trial court did not address the application of Ohio Adm.Code 109:4-3-10 to appellees\u2019 class-certification request.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-9\">{\u00b6 48} Being generic, but nevertheless reasonably specific, the substantiation requirement of Ohio Adm.Code 109:4-3-10 may apply to Philip Morris\u2019s marketing of its cigarettes. However, as appellees concede, the mainstream smoke of the company\u2019s Marlboro Lights and Virginia Slims Lights cigarettes produces lower levels of tar and nicotine than the mainstream smoke of its regular brands bearing those names when tested under the testing methods approved by the Federal Trade Commission. Philip Morris, in opposing class certification, points <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>to a consent decree issued by the Federal Trade Commission resolving an action against the cigarette manufacturer American Brands that holds that terms such as \u201clow\u201d or \u201clower\u201d may be used to reflect the tar and nicotine levels relative to other brands of cigarettes. <em>In re Am. Brands </em>(1971), 79 FTC 255, 1971 WL 128779. Use of the term \u201clights\u201d carries the same connotation, according to Philip Morris.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">{\u00b6 49} The Federal Trade Commission has jurisdiction in matters involving the labeling and advertising of cigarettes. <em>Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc. </em>(1992), 505 U.S. 504, 513, 112 S.Ct. 2608, 120 L.Ed.2d 407. In that connection, the agency has given great weight to its approved testing methods as a basis for comparative representations concerning tar and nicotine levels. <em>Watson v. Philip Morris Cos., Inc. </em>(C.A.8, 2005), 420 F.3d 852, 855-860. R.C. 1345.02(C) directs the courts to \u201cgive due consideration and great weight to federal trade commission orders, trade regulation rules and guides\u201d when determining whether a supplier has committed an unfair or deceptive act or practice. R.C. 1345.11(B)(2) states that a showing \u201cby a preponderance of the evidence that a violation [of R.C. 1345.02 or 1345.03] was an act or practice required or specifically permitted by federal trade commission orders [or] trade regulation rules or guides\u201d constitutes an affirmative defense to a claim brought pursuant to R.C. 1345.09.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">{\u00b6 50} In their totality, the foregoing provisions could doom appellees\u2019 request for class certification as well as their underlying claim for relief. However, those are determinations that the trial court should make. Like the majority, I would reverse the class certification ordered, but I would remand the cause for further proceedings on the issue of class certification in relation to the substantiation requirement on which appellees rely.</p>\n<judges id=\"b329-7\">Lanzinger, J., concurs in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b326-8\">. A number of such rules have been adopted by the Attorney General. They include rules prohibiting failure to disclose material exclusions and limitations in advertisements (Ohio Adm.Code 109:4-3-02), bait-and-switeh advertising (Ohio Adm.Code 109:4-3-03), misuse of the word \u201cfree\u201d (Ohio Adm.Code 109:4-3-04), failure to provide a prior estimate of repair costs on a prescribed form (Ohio Adm.Code 109:4-3-05), failure to disclose consideration required to receive a prize (Ohio Adm.Code 109:4-3-06), failure to honor a deposit (Ohio Adm.Code 109:4-3-07), misrepresenting used products as new (Ohio Adm.Code 109:4-3-08), failure to deliver represented goods or services (Ohio Adm.Code 109:4-3-09), failure to have substantiation for factual claims made (Ohio Adm.Code 109:4-3-10), misconduct in direct solicitation (Ohio Adm.Code 109:4-3-11), deceptive price comparisons (Ohio Adm.Code 109:4^-3-12), and misrepresentation of \u201cdistress sales\u201d (Ohio Adm.Code 109:4-3-17).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b327-10\">. FTC Release, Sept. 22,1955, 6 Trade Reg. Rep. \u00b6 39012 at 41602.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b329-8\">Pfeifer, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AP\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-9\">{\u00b6 51} How much notice does a company need to know that it is not allowed to \u201cma[k]e a misleading statement of opinion on which the consumer [is] likely to rely to his detriment\u201d? R.C. 1345.03(6). According to the majority opinion, R.C. 1345.09(B) requires that a company receive notice from a published court opinion or a rule of the Attorney General that a similar industry-specific practice is deceptive or unconscionable before a class-action lawsuit can be pursued. The majority opinion\u2019s unconscionably narrow reading of R.C. 1345.09 severely limits the ability of consumers to bring a class-action lawsuit under Ohio\u2019s Consumer Sales Practices Act (\u201cCSPA\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-10\">{\u00b6 52} The CSPA does not require industry-specific notice, and neither should this court. This court should interpret the CSPA to \u201c[p]rotect consumers from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>suppliers who * * * commit deceptive acts or practices, or commit unconscionable acts or practices.\u201d Ohio Adm.Code 109:4-3-01(A)(2)(b). Instead, it has in effect immunized companies from class-action lawsuits by the people they deceive. Because many violations of the CSPA involve only limited or de minimus damages, an unfortunate consequence of this court\u2019s decision is that many deceived parties will have no recourse against the company that deceived them.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">{\u00b6 53} In this case, it is alleged that Philip Morris USA, Inc. (\u201cPMI\u201d) sold cigarettes that it characterized as \u201clow tar\u201d and \u201clight,\u201d even though it knew that the cigarettes delivered as much tar and nicotine as regular cigarettes. In <em>State ex rel. Celebrezze v. Hi-Lo Oil Co., Inc. </em>(July 31, 1985), Franklin C.P. No. 85-CV-01-518, a court determined, unsurprisingly, that selling gasoline from one underground tank as two distinct gasoline products with different costs per gallon and octane ratings is a deceptive practice. Does anyone seriously doubt whether this published opinion put PMI on notice that it could not characterize cigarettes as \u201clight\u201d and sell them as such when it knew that the cigarettes were not light? If PMI acted as alleged, it knew that it was being deceptive and it knew that another company, albeit in a different business, had been found liable for a similar deceptive or unconscionable practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">{\u00b6 54} As I construe the majority opinion, a company that sells gasoline is on notice that it may not characterize gasoline as \u201clow tar\u201d or \u201clight\u201d and sell it as such if it is not low tar or light. A company selling gasoline would be on notice that such a practice is sufficiently similar to the deceptive practice in <em>Hi-Lo Oil Co. </em>But companies in other businesses are apparently not on notice that making false characterizations is deceptive. And they won\u2019t be until a court in this state rules that a company in their industry committed a deceptive practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">{\u00b6 55} One last thing: it is unclear just how similar the act that has previously been determined to be deceptive has to be to the act in question in order to qualify as notice. Perhaps deception about pricing is insufficiently similar to deception about quality to put a company on notice for class-action purposes. Perhaps a woman\u2019s deceiving a customer is insufficiently similar to a man\u2019s deceiving a customer. Perhaps deceiving a customer about a Honda is insufficiently similar to deceiving a customer about a Ford. We\u2019ll just have to wait and see.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">{\u00b6 56} In my opinion, selling a product as one thing when it is in fact another is sufficiently similar to selling a product as one thing when it is in fact another. I would certify the class and allow the plaintiffs to proceed to trial. To do otherwise is to encourage everyone doing business in this state to engage in deceptive practices.
