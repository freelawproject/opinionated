In construing the substantially similar language of R.C. 5717.05, we held that the requirement of joinder and service is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Huber Hts. Circuit Courts, Ltd. v. Came </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 306, 308, 658 N.E.2d 744, 745. Likewise, appellant\u2019s failure in this case to comply with its statutory obligation to serve the notice of appeal on the Tax Commissioner in the prescribed manner deprives this court of jurisdiction to consider the appeal. See <em>Am. Restaurant &amp; Lunch Co. v. Glander </em>(1946), 147 Ohio St. 147, 34 O.O. 8, 70 N.E.2d 93, paragraph one of the syllabus (\u201cWhere a statute confers the right of appeal, adherence to the conditions thereby imposed is essential to the enjoyment of the right conferred\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b864-10\">{\u00b6 3} Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b864-11\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell and Lanzinger, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b864-12\">Pfeifer, J., dissents.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b864-13\">Pfeifer, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AOP\">dissenting.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b865-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1243\">*1243</page-number>Karen H.

Hinkel, and Jeffrey Platko, for appellee, Board of Education of the Orange City School District.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b865-4\">{\u00b6 4} For the reasons expressed in its opinion, I would affirm the decision of the Board of Tax Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">{\u00b6 5} I would also address the issue of service. S.CtPrac.R. II(3)(A)(1) requires conformance with R.C. 5717.04, which requires parties that appeal a decision of the Board of Tax Appeals to this court to serve a notice of appeal on the Tax Commissioner. I believe dual filing requirements such as this should not be part of our rules. They serve no purpose except to deny parties a chance to be heard on the merits. I dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
