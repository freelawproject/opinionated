The State of Ohio <em>v. </em>Davis.</parties>\n<p data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"citation\" id=\"b823-6\">[Cite as <em>In re Disqualification of Rastatter, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 1201, 2005-ohio-7147.]</p>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"b823-9\">(No. 05-AP-021</docketnumber>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AOBJ\">Decided March 9, 2005.)</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b823-11\">Moyer, C.J.</author>\n<p id=\"b823-12\">{\u00b6 1} Attorneys Matthew Ryan Arntz and George A. Katchmer \u2014 counsel for the defendant \u2014 have filed affidavits with the clerk of this court under R.C. 2701.03, seeking the disqualification of Judge Douglas M. Rastatter from acting on any further proceedings in case No. 98-CR-0681 in the Court of Common Pleas of Clark County.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-13\">{\u00b6 2} The attorneys ask that Judge Rastatter be disqualified because until he assumed his present judicial position in February 2005, he served as an assistant prosecuting attorney in the office that represents the plaintiff, the state of Ohio, in this case. That past professional connection between the judge and one party to the case will prevent the defendant from receiving a fair trial, according to the defendant\u2019s attorneys. They allege as well that the judge has shown bias by ruling against the defendant on pretrial motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-14\">{\u00b6 3} I find no basis for ordering the disqualification of Judge Rastatter. A judge generally need not disqualify himself from presiding over a criminal matter that, although pending at the time he served as a prosecuting attorney, was one in which he had no direct involvement. See, e.g., <em>Gamez v. State </em>(Tex.Crim.App. 1987), 737 S.W.2d 315, 319 (the prohibition against a judge\u2019s hearing a case in which he has acted as counsel requires that he actually have participated in the very case before him); <em>People v. Mitchell </em>(1987), 137 Misc.2d 450, 452, 521 N.Y.S.2d 639 (a judge is not disqualified from presiding over a defendant\u2019s criminal case when that defendant was prosecuted in another matter by the office of the district attorney when the judge was district attorney).</p>\n<p id=\"b823-15\">{\u00b6 4} In cases such as this, the issue is whether the judge, while in government employment, himself served as counsel in the case. \u201c[A] judge is not subject to mandatory disqualification arising from prior government service based on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1202\">*1202</page-number>mere fact that another lawyer in his office served as a lawyer concerning the matter.\u201d <em>Kendrick v. Carlson </em>(C.A.8, 1993), 995 F.2d 1440, 1444.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">{\u00b6 5} The affidavit does not allege that Judge Rastatter himself participated in the prosecution of this defendant. In similar cases involving former prosecutors who have moved to the bench, I have declined to order the judge\u2019s disqualification. See, e.g., <em>In re Disqualification of Greer </em>(1997), 81 Ohio St.3d 1208, 688 N.E.2d 513; <em>In re Disqualification of Knece </em>(1997), 81 Ohio St.3d 1212, 688 N.E.2d 515. Absent some indication in the record that the judge\u2019s former relationship with the prosecuting attorney\u2019s office will clearly and adversely affect the defendant\u2019s ability to obtain a fair trial, disqualification is not warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">{\u00b6 6} The same is true of the affiants\u2019 allegations about the judge\u2019s pretrial rulings. A party\u2019s disagreement or dissatisfaction with a court\u2019s rulings of law, without more, does not constitute bias or prejudice. <em>In re Disqualification of Murphy </em>(1988), 36 Ohio St.3d 605, 522 N.E.2d 459. An affidavit of disqualification \u201cis not a vehicle to contest matters of substantive or procedural law.\u201d <em>In re Disqualification of Solovan, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 1214, 2003-Ohio-5484, 798 N.E.2d 3, \u00b6 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-7\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cA judge is presumed to follow the law and not to be biased, and the appearance of bias or prejudice must be compelling to overcome these presumptions.\u201d <em>In re Disqualification of George, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 1241, 2003-Ohio-5489, 798 N.E.2d 23, \u00b6 5. Those presumptions have not been overcome in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-8\">{\u00b6 8} For the reasons stated above, the affidavits of disqualification are denied. The case shall proceed before Judge Rastatter.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
