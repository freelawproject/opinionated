Respondent filed an answer to the complaint, and a panel of the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline held a hearing on the complaint in December 2005. The panel then prepared written findings of fact, conclusions of law, and a recommendation, all of which the board adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-13\">Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"AW3\">\n<em>Count I</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b526-14\">{\u00b6 3} In March 2001, respondent was charged with the offense of operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated. She later pleaded guilty to reckless operation of a motor vehicle and was sentenced to 90 days in jail, with 87 days of the sentence suspended. She was also fined and placed on probation for two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-15\">{\u00b6 4} In July 2001, respondent was arrested for driving while her driver\u2019s license was suspended. She later pleaded guilty to that charge and was sentenced to 180 days in jail, with the entire jail term suspended. She was also fined and placed on probation for two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>{\u00b6 5} In September 2001, respondent was charged with the offense of telephone harassment. She later pleaded no contest to the charge and was sentenced to 180 days in jail, with the entire jail term suspended. She was also fined and placed on probation for two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">{\u00b6 6} In May 2002, respondent was arrested for several offenses, including operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated, driving while her driver\u2019s license was suspended, endangering children, and possession of an open container of alcohol in a moving motor vehicle. Those charges stemmed from an anonymous tip that respondent had appeared to be intoxicated when she picked her son up from his school. Respondent pleaded no contest to operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated, and she was sentenced to 180 days in jail, with 170 days of the sentence suspended. She was also fined and placed on probation for five years, and her driver\u2019s license was suspended for two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">{\u00b6 7} Respondent was argumentative during her arrest on the May 2002 charges, which led to her indictment on three felony counts of assault. She later pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of resisting arrest and was fined $100.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">{\u00b6 8} In January 2003, respondent was charged with the offense of criminal trespassing. She later pleaded guilty to a charge of disorderly conduct and was fined $100.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">{\u00b6 9} We agree with the board\u2019s finding that respondent\u2019s actions violated DR 1-102(A)(5) (barring conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice) and 1-102(A)(6) (barring conduct that adversely reflects on a lawyer\u2019s fitness to practice law).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-9\">\n<em>Count II</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b527-10\">{\u00b6 10} In connection with a civil lawsuit filed by respondent against her ex-husband, a magistrate issued a protective order barring the parties from discussing certain deposition testimony outside a courtroom setting. In violation of the order, respondent disclosed the protected testimony to her daughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-11\">{\u00b6 11} We agree with the board\u2019s finding that respondent\u2019s action violated DR 1-102(A)(5) and 1-102(A)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-12\">Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b527-13\">{\u00b6 12} In recommending a sanction for this misconduct, the board considered the aggravating and mitigating factors listed in Section 10 of the Rules and Regulations Governing Procedure on Complaints and Hearings Before the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline (\u201cBCGD Proc.Reg.\u201d). The one aggravating factor identified by the board was respondent\u2019s participation in a pattern of misconduct. BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(1)(c). The board also noted that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>although respondent was aware of the time and place of her disciplinary hearing, she failed to appear.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">{\u00b6 13} According to the board, respondent appears to be suffering from an alcohol-dependency problem that has contributed to her misconduct. Because she has not completed an approved treatment program, however, that dependency cannot be considered a mitigating factor under BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2)(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">{\u00b6 14} Scott Mote, executive director of the Ohio Lawyers Assistance Program, testified that he \u201cwouldn\u2019t want her as a fellow member of th\u00e9 bar [and] would not want her representing clients\u201d because respondent is in \u201cvery deep\u201d denial about her alcohol problem and has not been willing to undergo treatment for that problem. Mote also stated that \u201chope\u2019s not lost\u201d for respondent but that she must stop drinking.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">{\u00b6 15} Relator and respondent\u2019s counsel both recommended that respondent be indefinitely suspended from the practice of law. The panel and the board likewise recommended an indefinite suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-8\">{\u00b6 16} We have reviewed the board\u2019s report and agree with the board\u2019s recommended sanction. As the board noted, respondent\u2019s misconduct did not involve her work on behalf of clients, and there is no evidence that her actions harmed any clients. Her own lawyer told the board that respondent is not fit to practice law at the present time, however, because she has not addressed her alcohol-dependency problem. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-9\">{\u00b6 17} In other cases involving attorneys who have engaged in misconduct attributable to untreated alcoholism, we have imposed indefinite suspensions. See, e.g., <em>Columbus Bar Assn. v. McCorkle, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 430, 2005-Ohio-2588, 828 N.E.2d 99; <em>Lake Cty. Bar Assn. v. Mazzocco </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 399, 709 N.E.2d 114; <em>Toledo Bar Assn. v. Hayes </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 336, 708 N.E.2d 201; <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Brown </em>(1996), 77 Ohio St.3d 91, 671 N.E.2d 232.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-10\">{\u00b6 18} Accordingly, respondent is hereby indefinitely suspended from the practice of law in Ohio. The court will not consider respondent\u2019s reinstatement until a medical professional has certified that respondent has completed a sustained period of recovery from alcohol dependency and until respondent has successfully complied with the terms of a contract with the Ohio Lawyers Assistance Program. Costs are taxed to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-11\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b528-12\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell and Lanzinger, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<attorneys id=\"b529-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>Jonathan E.
