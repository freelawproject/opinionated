Roberts, phoned 911 to report the death of her former husband, Robert Fingerhut, at the home they shared in Howland Township, Trumbull County, Ohio. After investigating, the police learned that Roberts and Nathaniel Jackson had plotted to kill Fingerhut while Jackson was in prison in the months preceding the murder. Subsequently, the pair were arrested and indicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-15\">{\u00b6 2} Jackson was convicted of the aggravated murder of Fingerhut and was sentenced to death, a conviction and sentence that we have affirmed. See <em>State v. Jackson, </em>107 Ohio St.3d 300, 2006-Ohio-1, 839 N.E.2d 362. In a separate trial, Roberts was found guilty of the aggravated murder of Fingerhut and was also sentenced to death.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-16\">{\u00b6 3} Roberts now appeals, raising an array of challenges to her conviction and sentence. Although we reject all of Roberts\u2019s attacks on her conviction, because of the trial judge\u2019s ex parte use of the prosecutor in directly preparing the court\u2019s sentencing opinion, we must vacate the sentence and remand the case to the trial court for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>RELEVANT BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">{\u00b6 4} The facts taken in the light favorable to the state establish the following facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">{\u00b6 5} Donna Roberts met Robert Fingerhut in Florida in 1983; they married, but were divorced soon thereafter. According to Roberts, the divorce was for financial and business reasons \u2014 i.e., that Fingerhut wanted to shelter and protect assets in case his business was sued or collapsed.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">{\u00b6 6} The couple moved to Ohio and established a home on Fonderlac Drive in Howland Township, Warren, Ohio. Fingerhut bought two Greyhound bus terminals \u2014 one in Warren and one in Youngstown \u2014 and began operating them. Those assets and almost all others were listed in Roberts\u2019s name.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">{\u00b6 7} Despite the divorce, Fingerhut appears to have continued to treat Roberts as his wife, referring to her as such in many of his business dealings. Most people who dealt with Roberts and Fingerhut assumed that they were married. Roberts similarly maintains that, in her mind, she did not consider herself divorced because she and Fingerhut were a devout, loving couple.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-9\">{\u00b6 8} Notwithstanding her feelings for Fingerhut, at some point during that relationship, Roberts met Nathaniel Jackson and began an affair with him. The liaison was interrupted in 2001, when Jackson was incarcerated in the Lorain Correctional Institution. Upon his release, however, they were reunited.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-10\">{\u00b6 9} On December 6, 2001, Roberts reserved and paid for a Jacuzzi suite in Jackson\u2019s name at the Wagon Wheel Motel in Boardman. Three days later, Jackson and Roberts spent the night in that room.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-11\">{\u00b6 10} Over the next several days, the pair were seen together at various places. A day or two before Fingerhut\u2019s death, Frank Reynolds, then an employee of the Greyhound bus terminal in Youngstown, saw Roberts and Jackson kissing and talking with one another near the terminal before Fingerhut arrived for work. Earlier, Reynolds had overheard Roberts asking Fingerhut for $3,000. Fingerhut had refused. According to Reynolds, Roberts was nervous and shaking and gave Fingerhut \u201cthe dirtiest look.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b384-12\">{\u00b6 11} On December 11, 2001, Greyhound bus driver Jim McCoy saw Finger-hut working at the Youngstown terminal at approximately 4:30 p.m. Fingerhut was the only person working that afternoon.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-13\">{\u00b6 12} Soon after seeing Fingerhut in the terminal, McCoy drove his bus to Warren. He saw Roberts and Jackson at the Warren terminal, and Jackson told McCoy, \u201c[W]e\u2019re trying to get out of here.\u201d On December 11, a server at the Red Lobster restaurant in Niles waited on a couple she later identified as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>Roberts and Jackson. The two paid for their dinner at 6:43 p.m. and left the restaurant.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">{\u00b6 13} Fingerhut left the Youngstown bus terminal around 9:00 p.m. on December 11, telling the security guard on duty that he was leaving early for the evening. Around 9:30 p.m., a neighbor observed Roberts driving her car very slowly on Old State Route 82 near their homes, even though no one else was on the road at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">{\u00b6 14} Later that night, Roberts went to the Days Inn in Boardman to reserve a room for the following week. She was alone and paced around the lobby. The room receipt indicates that she paid for the room at 11:33 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">{\u00b6 15} At 12:01 a.m., December 12, 2001, Trumbull County authorities received a 911 call from Roberts, who was screaming hysterically that there was something wrong with her husband. Upon arriving at the home, police found Fingerhut\u2019s body on the kitchen floor near the door to the garage.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-9\">{\u00b6 16} A Trumbull County forensic pathologist, Dr. Humphrey Germaniuk, observed Fingerhut\u2019s body at the crime scene and later performed an autopsy. Fingerhut had sustained lacerations and abrasions to his left hand and head, as well as multiple gunshot wounds to his head, chest, and back. Dr. Germaniuk concluded that the gunshot to Fingerhut\u2019s head was the cause of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-10\">{\u00b6 17} During the crime-scene search, police found a fully loaded .38-caliber revolver near Fingerhut\u2019s body. A firearms expert with the Bureau of Criminal Identification and Investigation (\u201cBCI\u201d) later concluded that the bullets recovered from the home and Fingerhut\u2019s body were fired from the same weapon, either a .38-caliber special or a .357 Magnum, but that none of the bullets had been fired from the revolver found near Fingerhut\u2019s body.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-11\">{\u00b6 18} During the hours immediately following Roberts\u2019s 911 call, police observed that her emotional state fluctuated. At times, she was calm and quiet, and at other times she was crying or screaming, \u201cOh, my Robert, my Robert.\u201d Two detectives noticed that when police investigators talked extensively, they no longer heard Roberts shouting. When a detective checked on Roberts in her bedroom because she had been quiet, she began shouting again upon seeing him. One officer at the scene remarked that he \u201cdidn\u2019t notice any tears coming from [Roberts\u2019s] eyes\u201d when she appeared to be crying.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-12\">{\u00b6 19} In this period of initial investigation, Roberts told police that she had left work at the Greyhound bus terminal in Warren at 5:30 that evening, had dined alone at a Red Lobster restaurant, and had then gone home. According to Roberts, Fingerhut called her and said he would be late coming home and suggested that she go shopping. Roberts said she had left her home at 9:00 p.m. and had gone to several stores. When she returned home shortly before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>midnight, she found Fingerhut lying on the floor, bleeding from the face. She also stated that her husband\u2019s car was not at the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">{\u00b6 20} Eventually, police arranged for Roberts\u2019s brother to pick her up while they continued to secure the scene and collect evidence. Before Roberts left the house, Detective Sergeant Paul Monroe told Roberts that the house was a crime scene and that police needed to search the house and everything in it, including the garage and cars. Roberts allegedly replied, \u201cDo whatever you have to do to catch the bastard.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">{\u00b6 21} At 3:38 a.m. that morning, police were still at the house investigating. The phone rang, and Detective Sergeant Monroe answered it. There was a pause, and then the caller hung up. Detective Monroe traced the call to Roberts\u2019s cell phone.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">{\u00b6 22} Around 10:00 a.m. that morning, Detective Monroe visited Roberts at her brother\u2019s home. At that time, Roberts gave police written consent to continue searching the residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">{\u00b6 23} Later, on the afternoon of December 12, Roberts met with Sergeant Frank Dillon and Detective Sergeant Monroe at the police station. Roberts described her \u201cloving relationship\u201d with Fingerhut but also stated that she and Fingerhut were a \u201ccool couple\u201d and that he \u201cdid his thing, she did hers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">{\u00b6 24} She described Fingerhut as \u201cgo[ing] both ways\u201d and said that he had a friend named \u201cBobby.\u201d She recalled that about a week and a half before the murder, Fingerhut was acting kind of \u201cnutty,\u201d and she had thought the behavior was because of his relationship with Bobby.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-9\">{\u00b6 25} Roberts also stated that she had been having a sexual relationship with a man named Carlos for six months. She additionally indicated that she had a friend named Santiago whom she had tried to help, but that he had stolen money and a gun from her. When Detective Monroe asked Roberts whether she had relationships with anyone else, Roberts replied, \u201cNo, there\u2019s nobody else. I told you everybody.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b386-10\">{\u00b6 26} Monroe then asked her about a man named Nate Jackson, and Roberts said, \u2018Yes, I forgot about him.\u201d Roberts admitted that she had been dating Jackson for two years and that he had called her from prison and had exchanged letters with her. Roberts claimed that she had last seen Jackson on December 9, when she picked him up at Lorain Correctional Institution and had then left him in Youngstown at a house on Wirt Street. Roberts added that she had last spoken to Jackson over the telephone rather than in person on the morning of December 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-11\">{\u00b6 27} Detective Monroe asked Roberts whether she had a cell phone and whether he could look at it. Roberts searched her purse and said that she had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>left it at home. Monroe then told Roberts that a call originating from her cell phone had been placed to the crime scene at 3:38 that morning. Roberts said, \u201cNate must have had the phone. He\u2019s always borrowing it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">{\u00b6 28} In the ensuing week and a half, police continued to investigate and learned that Jackson and Roberts had spent a night together at the Wagon Wheel Motel and that Roberts had registered at the Days Inn and had paid for one week\u2019s rental.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">{\u00b6 29} Police and a BCI agent located and retrieved evidence, including Jackson\u2019s fingerprints, from the room at the Days Inn in which Jackson had stayed. Police also recovered a garbage bag in a dumpster at the motel that had come from Jackson\u2019s room. That bag contained a bottle of peroxide, used bandages, and gauze with blood that was consistent with Jackson\u2019s DNA profile.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">{\u00b6 30} Police learned that Fingerhut had taken out two life insurance policies on his life, naming Roberts as sole beneficiary. The aggregate benefit of the policies amounted to $550,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">{\u00b6 31} On December 12, police found Fingerhut\u2019s abandoned vehicle in Youngstown, approximately three blocks from Wirt Street. A forensic specialist found blood on the driver\u2019s side visor and on other areas inside the automobile. Subsequent scientific analysis determined that blood on the visor contained a mixture consistent with both Jackson\u2019s and Fingerhut\u2019s DNA profiles. Blood recovered from the trunk release inside the car contained a DNA mixture with a major profile that was consistent with Jackson\u2019s DNA and a minor profile consistent with Fingerhut\u2019s DNA. The frequency for Jackson\u2019s DNA on the trunk release was one in 45 quintillion, 170 quadrillion in the Caucasian population, and one in 29 quadrillion, 860 trillion in the African-American population. Jackson is African-American.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">{\u00b6 32} Cell-phone records indicated that a number of phone calls were made on December 11 between 9:45 p.m. and 11:44 p.m. from the cell phone that Roberts said Jackson had borrowed from her and a cell phone located in Roberts\u2019s vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-9\">{\u00b6 33} Additional evidence implicated Roberts and Jackson in the murder. As noted previously, Roberts had admitted to police that she and Jackson had exchanged letters and telephone calls during his incarceration. During their initial search of the home, police discovered more than 140 letters and cards written by Jackson to Roberts, most of which were addressed to Roberts at a post office box in Warren.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-10\">{\u00b6 34} Police also found a brown paper bag with Jackson\u2019s name on it in the trunk of Roberts\u2019s car, which had been parked in the garage at their residence. The bag contained clothing and approximately 140 handwritten letters, dated between October and December 2001, sent by Roberts to Jackson.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>{\u00b6 35} Passages from letters exchanged between Jackson and Roberts suggested strongly that there had been a plot to murder Fingerhut. Many of the letters described the couple\u2019s physical relationship and plans for Jackson\u2019s release, as well as references to how they would deal with Fingerhut once Jackson was out of prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">{\u00b6 36} For example, in a letter from early October 2001, Jackson wrote Roberts:<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201c[W]hy don\u2019t you leave Robert an lets carry on with a world of our own? Or let me do what I was gonna do to him, because you know that \u2014 that was our little thing so you better not go an try to get know one else to do it, because I told you its getting done when I come home * * Less than a week later, Jackson wrote Roberts: \u201cDonna I got it already planned out on how we are gonna take care of the Robert situation? An baby its the best plan ever! Because Donna its now time that we really be together so that we can really see the true side of our love because I\u2019m tired of not being able to be with you # # jJ&lt; J?</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">{\u00b6 37} Soon thereafter, Jackson again expressed his desire to be with Roberts and to be rid of Fingerhut: \u201cDonna I don\u2019t care what you say but Robert has to go! An I\u2019m not gonna let you stop me this time. An Donna you know that I\u2019ve always wanted to live my life with you an only you but everytime that I wanted to take care of the situation by myself you wouldn\u2019t never let me. * * * Because you wouldn\u2019t let me do what I wanted to do to make you happy an that was get rid of him! So Donna can I do this so that we can go on an live happy? An then maybe we can sell the house an move on to somewhere else in our own world. An I\u2019m not gonna be happy until that happens!\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">{\u00b6 38} Roberts responded to Jackson with her own letters. In one from mid-October 2001, she indicated her frustration over limits that Fingerhut apparently had imposed on her spending and her apparent agreement to Jackson\u2019s plan for Fingerhut\u2019s murder. She wrote, \u201cYou know you can always count on me \u2014 you always could. It\u2019ll just be a little tougher now because he gives me $100 a week for everything and then makes me write checks to keep track of it all. And I haven\u2019t been ALLOWED to use any of my 52 charge cards \u2014 emergency only. I am not used to living like this. I am used to having plenty of cash for whatever I want &amp; buying everything I want. Maybe those days will return again soon. Do whatever you want to him ASAP. Amen.\u201d Jackson replied, \u201cAn then after that you don\u2019t ever have to worry about making know more excuses to him, because he will no longer be with us after 12-10-01 an then it\u2019ll be me an you totally an completely * * *.\u201d Within that same passage, Jackson drew a tombstone with the inscription, \u201cRest In Piss,\u201d before continuing, \u201cHey Donna just think come <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>12-11-01 you\u2019ll be waking up to me or maybe we\u2019ll give it a couple of days to let things look cool an then after the funeral baby when I come home I\u2019m never leaving an we\u2019re only doing it like that just to make it look good * * *. Alls I need is for my baby not to worry an leave everything else up to me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">{\u00b6 39} Jackson\u2019s subsequent letters further evinced the developing plan to deal with \u201cthe Robert problem.\u201d Jackson wrote, \u201cYes I\u2019m taking care of that the next night, because I told you I\u2019m tired of living like this when I don\u2019t have to. An after that will you get me a 2002 Cadillac Deville?\u201d In that same letter, Jackson wrote: \u201cAn even if I gotta come to the house and shoot Robert in his fucking head you\u2019re gonna be with me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">{\u00b6 40} The letters also indicate a role for Roberts in the scheme. An October letter from Jackson reads, \u201cWell I see now you know that I\u2019m about my business when I get out as far as our little situation? An get me a size large leather gloves an see if you can find me a ski mask hat okay? An I need them handcuffs you have an its mandatory, so get them for me, because the way that I\u2019m gonna do it is gonna be right okay?\u201d About two weeks before the murder, Roberts wrote to Jackson: \u201cI also went to 4 stores and finally found your ski mask <em>&amp; </em>boxers &amp; a pair of beautiful fleeced lined black leather gloves.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">{\u00b6 41} Though the words written in those letters were significant evidence of the planning of the murder, the state also marshaled the actual words spoken between Roberts and Jackson.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-9\">{\u00b6 42} Prison, authorities at Lorain Correctional Institute routinely record telephone conversations of prisoners and maintain the recordings for at least six months. Eighteen phone calls between Roberts and Jackson were recorded electronically. Those recordings also reflect the plot to murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-10\">{\u00b6 43} For example, in a recorded conversation between Jackson and Roberts on October 25, 2001, the following colloquy took place:</p>\n<p id=\"b389-11\">{\u00b6 44} \u201c[JACKSON]: I\u2019ll be home to you. December 9th all the worries will be over baby.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-12\">{\u00b6 45} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b389-13\">{\u00b6 46} \u201c[JACKSON]: The next day out, I\u2019m goin to \u2014 I already got it in my mind, my mind made up. I\u2019m goin to go ahead and do that the next day, okay. All right.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-14\">{\u00b6 47} \u201c[ROBERTS]: Oh, I just wrote to you that I didn\u2019t think that you really meant it.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-15\">{\u00b6 48} \u201c[JACKSON]: What. My mind is made up. My mind made \u2014 I wrote it in my letters, you know what I\u2019m saying, but you know, I don\u2019t like to talk too much like that but when I come home, you know what I mean, it\u2019s goin to be in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>full detail. Okay. Pm goin to let you know how Pm goin to do it and everything. Pm goin to do it for sure the next day.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">{\u00b6 49} In recorded phone conversations between Jackson and Roberts during November 2001, they continued to discuss what Jackson planned to do to Fingerhut. In a conversation on November 8, 2001, Jackson told Roberts that he wanted Fingerhut to see Roberts performing oral sex on Jackson before Finger-hut \u201cgoes away.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">{\u00b6 50} Two weeks later, Roberts worried about Jackson\u2019s being apprehended for the murder of Fingerhut:</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">{\u00b6 51} \u201c[JACKSON]: You know what Pm saying, the next day after. You know what I told you I wanted to do right?</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">{\u00b6 52} \u201c[ROBERTS]: Pm afraid Nate.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">{\u00b6 53} \u201c[JACKSON]: What you, man.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-9\">{\u00b6 54} \u201c[ROBERTS]: I can\u2019t afford to lose you. * * * I can not lose you. Like I will kill myself.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-10\">{\u00b6 55} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b390-11\">{\u00b6 56} \u201c[JACKSON]: Just forget about it man, * * * when a person, man, know what he\u2019s doing, man, * * * that\u2019s like jinxing, man. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b390-12\">{\u00b6 57} \u201c[ROBERTS]: But what was the story with the trunk and handcuffs, that\u2019s too involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-13\">{\u00b6 58} \u201c[JACKSON]: Just, just, just leave it alone, alright.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-14\">{\u00b6 59} \u201c[ROBERTS]: It\u2019s too much involved. Your gonna leave hair, your gonna leave prints, your gonna,</p>\n<p id=\"b390-15\">{\u00b6 60} \u201c[JACKSON]: Leave it alone, man. Leave it alone, alright. * * * Come on man. This ain\u2019t Perry Mason man.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-16\">{\u00b6 61} \u201c[ROBERTS]: I don\u2019t want to know anything about it ever.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b390-17\">{\u00b6 62} On November 24, Jackson tried to reassure Roberts about his plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-18\">{\u00b6 63} \u201c[JACKSON]: Man, we gonna * * * really talk when I come home, ok.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-19\">{\u00b6 64} \u201c[ROBERTS]: OK.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-20\">{\u00b6 65} \u201c[JACKSON]: Especially about our, that situation, man. You know.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-21\">{\u00b6 66} \u201c[ROBERTS]: Yeah.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-22\">{\u00b6 67} \u201c[JACKSON]: I mean, it just, you know, you get too nervous at times, that\u2019s all the deal is.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-23\">{\u00b6 68} \u201c[ROBERTS]: Yeah I know, it part of my nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-24\">{\u00b6 69} \u201c[JACKSON]: And then you said DNA, the only way they can do a DNA is if they got the other, the person\u2019s, you know what Pm saying. If they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>got the person and the hair cause they can\u2019t just take no hair and say this is such and such hair. * * * [T]he laws that we got in the State of Ohio and the laws from everywhere else, * * * I mean they way different. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">{\u00b6 70} \u201c[ROBERTS]: Really.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">{\u00b6 71} \u201c[JACKSON]: Hell yeah. We\u2019ll, we\u2019ll talk about it when I come home Donna. Ok, I don\u2019t want to talk about it over the phone.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">{\u00b6 72} Around Thanksgiving 2001, Roberts and Jackson discussed DNA evidence, a \u201cbig 38\u201d firearm, their reunification on the night after his release from prison and his stay in a hotel the week thereafter, and Roberts\u2019s complete reliance on Jackson.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">{\u00b6 73} On December 8, the day before Jackson was released from prison, Jackson and Roberts had one final recorded conversation. Roberts expressed misgivings about what Jackson was planning to do to Fingerhut, but Jackson told her, \u201cI got to do this Donna. I got to.\u201d Roberts told Jackson that she did not want to know about it. The following colloquy then took place:</p>\n<p id=\"b391-9\">{\u00b6 74} \u201c[JACKSON]: Just consider it a done deal. Only thing I\u2019m gonna need is one thing.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-10\">{\u00b6 75} \u201c[ROBERTS]: What?</p>\n<p id=\"b391-11\">{\u00b6 76} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b391-12\">{\u00b6 77} \u201c[JACKSON]: I just need to be in that house when he come home.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-13\">{\u00b6 78} \u201c[ROBERTS]: Oh no.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-14\">{\u00b6 79} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b391-15\">{\u00b6 80} \u201c[JACKSON]: Baby it ain\u2019t gonna happen in the house. It ain\u2019t gonna happen in the house man, I promise you.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-16\">{\u00b6 81} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b391-17\">{\u00b6 82} \u201c[JACKSON]: I just need to be in there man. It ain\u2019t gonna happen in the house man. I mean I ain\u2019t gonna jeopardize that man.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-18\">{\u00b6 83} \u201c[ROBERTS]: Well, let\u2019s not talk about it now.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-19\">{\u00b6 84} \u201c[JACKSON]: Ok. We\u2019ll talk, we\u2019ll, I\u2019ll just wait until tomorrow.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b391-20\">{\u00b6 85} In light of the accumulating inculpatory evidence and Roberts\u2019s unpersuasive explanations for it, Jackson and Roberts became the prime suspects in Fingerhut\u2019s murder. Detective Monroe then arranged for Roberts to call Jackson to ask him some prepared questions and for police to record the conversation. According to Detective Monroe, however, Roberts failed to ask Jackson the critical questions that police had instructed her to ask.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-21\">{\u00b6 86} On December 21, 2001, Roberts was arrested at her home for the murder of Robert Fingerhut. That same day, police raided a home on Wirt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>Street in Youngstown, and Jackson surrendered. At that time, Jackson had a bandage wrapped around his left index finger. A search of the Wirt Street home uncovered additional evidence. Included in that evidence was a pair of black leather gloves; the index finger of the left glove appeared to have been torn off, and there was a red substance on the glove near the tear.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">{\u00b6 87} On December 28, 2001, a grand jury indicted Roberts on two counts of aggravated murder related to Fingerhut\u2019s death. R.C. 2903.01(A) and (B). Both murder counts carried two death-penalty specifications: murder during an aggravated burglary and murder during an aggravated robbery. R.C. 2929.04(A)(7). The grand jury also indicted Roberts on separate counts of aggravated burglary and aggravated robbery, each carrying a firearm specification.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">{\u00b6 88} At trial, the state presented numerous witnesses establishing the facts previously set forth. The defense presented no witnesses. The jury found Roberts guilty of aggravated murder and the other offenses as charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">{\u00b6 89} At the mitigation hearing, Roberts waived the presentation of evidence except for a lengthy unsworn statement. The jury recommended \u2014 and the trial court imposed \u2014 the death penalty on Roberts.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">{\u00b6 90} In this appeal of her conviction and sentence, Roberts now raises 14 propositions of law. We have reviewed each and determined that Roberts demonstrates no error that would justify reversal of her conviction. Although most of her claims related to sentencing also fail, for the reasons set forth more fully below, we hold that the trial court\u2019s sentencing opinion supporting the death penalty is so grievously flawed that it cannot properly support the sentence imposed. We therefore affirm Roberts\u2019s convictions and other sentences, but we must vacate the death sentence and remand the cause to the trial court to reconsider the imposition of the death penalty and to prepare a proper sentencing opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-9\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"AW0\">PRETRIAL ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"AR-\">\n<em>The Motion to Suppress</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b392-10\">{\u00b6 91} In proposition of law two, Roberts argues that police exceeded the scope of her consent to search the home during the investigation of Fingerhut\u2019s murder and that the trial court erred in failing to suppress her letters to Jackson, which the police seized from inside a bag in the trunk of her car in the attached garage. Roberts contends that a reasonable person would have believed that the police would be searching her house, but not a vehicle in the garage that was not at her home at the time of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>{\u00b6 92} During the pretrial hearing on appellant\u2019s motion to suppress, the state presented several witnesses who testified that Roberts clearly and directly gave police open-ended consent to search the premises. The testimony received at the suppression hearing was consistent: Roberts told police to do whatever they needed to do in their efforts to find out who killed Fingerhut.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\">{\u00b6 93} Howland Township police officer Albert Ray, who investigated the murder scene shortly after Roberts called 911, testified that he overheard Detective Paul Monroe tell Roberts that the entire residence was a crime scene and that police needed to look everywhere for evidence or possible suspects. Roberts reportedly responded, \u201cDo whatever you have to do to catch the bastard.\u201d Similarly, Detective Sergeant Frank Dillon was at the residence shortly after the body was discovered and heard Detective Monroe explain to Roberts that police would have to go through the entire house because it was a crime scene. According to Detective Sergeant Dillon, Detective Monroe told Roberts that police needed to search for evidence to determine who committed the murder, and Roberts was adamant in her reply: \u201cI don\u2019t care, you do what you have to do. I want you to get the person who did this to my Robert.\u201d {\u00b6 94} Detective Sergeant Monroe himself testified that after he told Roberts that police needed to process the entire house as a crime scene, Roberts said: \u201c[D]o whatever you have to do, search the whole place, just find the guy.\u201d He further testified that Roberts gave him permission to look anywhere on the property to find clues as to who had committed the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">{\u00b6 95} Roberts\u2019s brother also testified. He stated that his sister was very cooperative with the police and did not rebuff them in any way. According to Roberts\u2019s brother, when police told her they wanted to search through the house for clues to the homicide, she told the police, \u201c[D]o what you got to do.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AE3\">{\u00b6 96} Captain Karl Compton of the Howland police accompanied Detective Monroe to the home of Roberts\u2019s brother on the morning after the murder, at which time Roberts signed the consent form to search the residence and both of the vehicles. According to Detective Monroe, Roberts was very positive about the consent to search and again said, \u201c[D]o whatever you have to do.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">{\u00b6 97} In light of such testimony, the trial court denied Roberts\u2019s motion to suppress. The court found that Roberts \u201crepeated the request for the police to find the killer, and there was every reason for the police to take her actions as a request for them to search for evidence. It was reasonable to imply Ms. Roberts [sic] consent to do so. This is reinforced by Ms. Roberts agreeing in writing later on * * * for the police to re-search the house.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">{\u00b6 98} The law in this area is settled. When police conduct a warrantless search, the state bears the burden of establishing the validity of the search. Searches and seizures without a warrant are \u201cper <em>se </em>unreasonable\u201d except in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>few well-defined and carefully circumscribed instances. <em>Coolidge v. New Hampshire </em>(1971), 403 U.S. 443, 454-455, 91 S.Ct. 2022, 29 L.Ed.2d 564. Accord <em>Payton v. New York </em>(1980), 445 U.S. 573, 586, 100 S.Ct. 1371, 63 L.Ed.2d 639. It is equally well established, however, that a search of property without a warrant or probable cause but with proper consent having been voluntarily obtained does not violate the Fourth Amendment. <em>Schneckloth v. Bustamonte </em>(1973), 412 U.S. 218, 249, 93 S.Ct. 2041, 36 L.Ed.2d 854; <em>State v. Posey </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 420, 427, 534 N.E.2d 61.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">{\u00b6 99} The question of whether consent to a search was voluntary or the product of duress or coercion, express or implied, is a question of fact to be determined from the totality of the circumstances. <em>Schneckloth, </em>412 U.S. at 227, 93 S.Ct. 2041, 36 L.Ed.2d 854. The standard for measuring the scope of consent under the Fourth Amendment is objective reasonableness, i.e., what a typical reasonable person would have understood by the exchange between the officer and the suspect. <em>Florida v. Jimeno </em>(1991), 500 U.S. 248, 251, 111 S.Ct. 1801, 114 L.Ed.2d 297.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">{\u00b6 100} \u201cAppellate review of a motion to suppress presents a mixed question of law and fact. When considering a motion to suppress, the trial court assumes the role of trier of fact and is therefore in the best position to resolve factual questions and evaluate the credibility of witnesses. <em>State v. Mills </em>(1992), 62 Ohio St.3d 357, 366, 582 N.E.2d 972. Consequently, an appellate court must accept the trial court\u2019s findings of fact if they are supported by competent, credible evidence. <em>State v. Fanning </em>(1982), 1 Ohio St.3d 19, [20], 1 OBR 57, 437 N.E.2d 583. Accepting these facts as true, the appellate court must then independently determine, without deference to the conclusion of the trial court, whether the facts satisfy the applicable legal standard.\u201d <em>State v. Burnside, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 152, 2003-Ohio-5372, 797 N.E.2d 71, at \u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">{\u00b6 101} We hold that the evidence here adequately supports the trial court\u2019s finding that Roberts gave unlimited consent to search the premises of her home. Roberts told Detective Monroe, \u201c[D]o whatever\u201d must be done and to \u201cdo what you have to do\u201d in searching the premises. Although Roberts was described as being in a fluctuating emotional state when the consent to search was requested initially, nothing suggests that her state of mind precluded her ability and desire to confer unconditional permission to search.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">{\u00b6 102} A reasonable person in Detective Monroe\u2019s position would have understood Roberts\u2019s statement, \u201cDo whatever you have to do, search the whole place, just find the [killer],\u201d as permitting voluntary consent to an unlimited search of the residence, including the attached garage where Roberts\u2019s car was parked. <em>Jimeno, </em>500 U.S. at 251, 111 S.Ct. 1801, 114 L.Ed.2d 297. Indeed, when police contacted Roberts hours later at her brother\u2019s home, she repeated her permission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>for police to \u201cdo whatever [they] have to do\u201d and signed a written consent to search the home and both automobiles. Other courts in similar circumstances have held that consent to search a residence and attached garage encompasses a search of a car found in the garage. See <em>United States v. Percival </em>(C.A.7, 1985), 756 F.2d 600, 612-613 (a warrant to search a residence and attached garage authorizes the search of a car found inside the garage); <em>United States v. Quiroz </em>(D.Minn.1999), 57 F.Supp.2d 805, 820-821 (voluntary consent to search a residence and attached garage includes the car parked in the garage). Accord <em>United States v. Caudill </em>(C.A.6, 2001), 25 Fed.Appx. 349, 353, 2001 WL 1671075. We find such decisions persuasive here.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">{\u00b6 103} Based on the totality of the circumstances presented, we conclude that Roberts gave clear, open-ended permission to the police to search the premises and that her consent extended to the garage and the vehicle therein. The trial court properly denied the motion to suppress. Accordingly, we overrule this claim of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">\n<em>Voir Dire Issues</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">{\u00b6 104} In proposition of law three, Roberts contends that in failing to excuse two prospective jurors because of their alleged bias and inability to fairly consider a life-sentence option, the trial court erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">{\u00b6 105} R.C. 2313.42(J) contemplates that \u201cgood cause\u201d exists for the removal of a prospective juror when \u201che discloses by his answers that he cannot be a fair and impartial juror or will not follow the law as given to him by the court.\u201d A prospective juror challenged for cause should be excused \u201cif the court has any doubt as to the juror\u2019s being entirely unbiased.\u201d R.C. 2313.43; see <em>State v. Cornwell </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 560, 563, 715 N.E.2d 1144; <em>State v. Allard </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 482, 495, 663 N.E.2d 1277.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-9\">{\u00b6 106} Trial courts have discretion in determining a juror\u2019s ability to be impartial, <em>State v. Williams </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St.3d 281, 288, 6 OBR 345, 452 N.E.2d 1323, and such a ruling \u201cwill not be disturbed on appeal unless it is manifestly arbitrary * * * so as to constitute an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>State v. Tyler </em>(1990), 50 Ohio St.3d 24, 31, 553 N.E.2d 576. Accord <em>State v. Williams </em>(1997), 79 Ohio St.3d 1, 8, 679 N.E.2d 646. With these standards in mind, we turn to the specific claims raised by Roberts.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-10\">{\u00b6 107} Alleging that one venireman, Andrew Kotwis, was unable to fairly consider a life sentence, Roberts asserts that the trial court abused its discretion in overruling her challenge to him for cause. Her claim is predicated largely on statements that the prospective juror made indicating that he would consider sympathy for the survivors in deciding whether to vote for a life sentence or the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>death penalty. A review of the transcript of the voir dire examination of Kotwis affords perspective and context.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">{\u00b6 108} Kotwis stated that he would \u201c[absolutely\u201d consider all sentencing options. He admitted that he believed that the death penalty provides comfort and solace to the survivors and that sympathy or comfort for the survivors would factor into his decision whether to vote for life or death. But after the trial court instructed Kotwis that sympathy could not be a determining factor in whether to vote for a death sentence, he agreed to obey the instruction. Moreover, Kotwis \u201c[a]bsolutely\u201d agreed with defense counsel that he would consider all sentencing options equally and that no option would \u201cstart with a leg up over the other.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">{\u00b6 109} In failing to dismiss Kotwis for cause, the trial court observed that Kotwis \u201crehabilitated himself\u2019 in his answers to the follow-up questions described. In these circumstances, we find no abuse of discretion on the part of the trial court in denying Roberts\u2019s request to discharge him for cause. Although Kotwis gave some answers that could be construed as ambiguous, he ultimately stated that he would consider all sentencing options equally. His credibility in making such statements was a matter for the trial judge. <em>Wainwright v. Witt </em>(1985), 469 U.S. 412, 426, 105 S.Ct. 844, 83 L.Ed.2d 841 (\u201cDeference must be paid to the trial judge who sees and hears the juror\u201d). Roberts fails to demonstrate that we should disturb that finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">{\u00b6 110} Roberts next asserts that the trial court abused its discretion in failing to excuse prospective juror Michael Blake, who expressed what Roberts characterizes as a fixed impression of her guilt. During the voir dire examination, Blake initially declared that from what he had read in the news, \u201cthey must have had a good reason to arrest [Roberts] * * *. [T]here must be some truth.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">{\u00b6 111} Blake\u2019s statements must also be considered in a larger context, however. In other statements, Blake stated that he could set aside anything he had read or heard and that he would consider the case solely on the evidence presented and the court\u2019s instructions. Blake conceded that although he believes mass murderers such as Ted Bundy should automatically get the death penalty, every case is different, and he did not presume anyone guilty. And at the conclusion of questioning, Blake reiterated that he would set aside everything he had read or heard about the case and make up his mind solely on the facts presented during trial. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to excuse prospective juror Blake for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">{\u00b6 112} Roberts claims that she suffered prejudice because she was \u201cforced\u201d to reserve her final peremptory challenge to prevent the impanelment of Kotwis and Blake, who were next in the venire to be seated in the jury box. She also asserts that she was prejudiced by using the two peremptory challenges allotted for alternate jurors to strike Kotwis and Blake. Given our conclusion that there is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>no showing that the trial court abused its discretion in rejecting her claims to remove Kotwis and Blake for cause, we reject these contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">{\u00b6 113} Our conclusion is not affected by the fact that an alternate juror was seated on the jury during trial when one juror had to be removed because of an ailment. We have held that a defendant may claim prejudice when she unsuccessfully challenges a venireman for cause and that venireman would have been seated as an alternate juror if the defense had not exercised a peremptory challenge. <em>State v. Group, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 248, 2002-Ohio-7247, 781 N.E.2d 980, \u00b6 61, fn. 1; see, also, <em>State v. Leonard, </em>104 Ohio St.3d 54, 2004-Ohio-6235, 818 N.E.2d 229, \u00b6 61; <em>State v. Tyler, </em>50 Ohio St.3d at 31-32, 553 N.E.2d 576. But implicit in that rule is the requirement of a finding that the trial court should have excused the juror for cause. <em>Group, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 248, 2002-Ohio-7247, 781 N.E.2d 980, \u00b6 61, quoting <em>State v. Cornwell </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 560, 564, 715 N.E.2d 1144 (\u201cOhio law recognizes that \u2018where the defense exhausts its peremptory challenges before the full jury is seated, <em>the erroneous denial </em>of a challenge for cause in a criminal may be prejudicial\u2019 \u201d). (Emphasis added.) Here, we have already concluded that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in failing to sustain the challenges for cause raised against the veniremen.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">{\u00b6 114} Moreover, Roberts fails to show that any of the jurors ultimately seated were other than impartial. Thus, she fails to demonstrate a violation of the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution. See <em>State v. Broom </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 277, 288, 533 N.E.2d 682. Accordingly, we reject Roberts\u2019s suggestion that there was error in the trial court\u2019s decisions in empaneling the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">\n<em>Change of Venue</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">{\u00b6 115} In proposition of law seven, Roberts attacks the trial judge\u2019s decision to deny her motion for a change of venue. In support of her contentions, Roberts points to pervasive pretrial publicity regarding the murder, Jackson\u2019s trial (which occurred only months prior to her own trial), and the state\u2019s theory of her complicity in the murder. Although there may have been a great deal of publicity about the murder and Jackson\u2019s trial in Trumbull County, we do not agree that Roberts shows that media coverage of the murder so saturated the county and influenced the potential venire that she was deprived of a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-9\">{\u00b6 116} A trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion for a change of venue pursuant to Crim.R. 18(B) will not be disturbed on appeal unless the court abused its discretion. See, e.g., <em>State v. Lundgren </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 474, 479, 653 N.E.2d 304; <em>State v. Landrum </em>(1990), 53 Ohio St.3d 107, 116, 559 N.E.2d 710. We have long held that a careful and searching voir dire examination provides the best test of whether prejudicial pretrial publicity prevents the seating of a fair <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>and impartial jury from the community. See <em>State v. Lynch, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 514, 2003-Ohio-2284, 787 N.E.2d 1185, at \u00b6 35; <em>Landrum, </em>53 Ohio St.3d at 117, 559 N.E.2d 710; <em>State v. Swiger </em>(1966), 5 Ohio St.2d 151, 34 O.O.2d 270, 214 N.E.2d 417, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">{\u00b6 117} A defendant claiming that pretrial publicity denied her a fair trial must show that one or more jurors were actually biased. <em>State v. Treesh </em>(2001), 90 Ohio St.3d 460, 464, 739 N.E.2d 749; <em>Mayola v. Alabama </em>(C.A.5, 1980), 623 F.2d 992, 996. Pretrial publicity \u2014 even pervasive, adverse publicity \u2014 does not inevitably lead to an unfair trial. <em>Nebraska Press Assn. v. Stuart </em>(1976), 427 U.S. 539, 554, 96 S.Ct. 2791, 49 L.Ed.2d 683. Only in rare cases may prejudice be presumed. <em>Treesh, </em>90 Ohio St.3d at 464, 739 N.E.2d 749.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">{\u00b6 118} We have held that extensive voir dire helps to eliminate any negative effect arising from the pretrial publicity, <em>Lundgren, </em>73 Ohio St.3d at 479-480, 653 N.E.2d 304, and the trial court here engaged in such an effort. The trial court held Roberts\u2019s motion to change venue in abeyance in order to determine whether pretrial publicity tainted the jury pool. It then conducted a thorough voir dire, as evidenced by the facts that voir dire took a month to complete and encompasses more than 20 volumes and approximately 4,700 pages of transcript. Near the conclusion of voir dire, the trial court overruled the motion to change venue, stating: \u201c[T]he Court feels very comfortable that this case can be fairly tried in this county * *</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">{\u00b6 119} To support her claim that fairness was lacking and that pretrial publicity impaired the trial court\u2019s ability to seat an impartial jury, Roberts cites the voir dire of seven prospective jurors. However, four of these prospective jurors never sat on the final panel, so prejudice to Roberts is not shown. <em>Treesh, </em>90 Ohio St.3d at 464, 739 N.E.2d 749.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">{\u00b6 120} Nor does the fact that three jurors had heard about some aspects of the case prior to trial necessarily reflect bias or lack of impartiality. See <em>State v. Ahmed, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 27, 2004-Ohio-4190, 813 N.E.2d 637, at \u00b6 37-41; <em>State v. Bies </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 320, 324, 658 N.E.2d 754. Moreover, defense counsel passed for cause on those three jurors and did not exercise a peremptory challenge on any of them, even though Roberts had remaining peremptory challenges at the time those jurors were seated. As we observed in a similar situation: \u201cThe absence of defense challenges for pretrial publicity and the failure to exhaust defense peremptory challenges indicate that the defense was not particularly troubled by the jury\u2019s exposure to pretrial publicity once voir dire was completed.\u201d <em>State v. Lynch, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 514, 2003-Ohio-2284, 787 N.E.2d 1185, at \u00b6 37. So, too, here.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">{\u00b6 121} Accordingly, we hold that there is not a sufficient showing that the trial court abused its discretion in denying Roberts\u2019s motion for change of venue. See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number><em>State v. Gross, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 121, 2002-Ohio-5524, 776 N.E.2d 1061, \u00b6 30. We reject Roberts\u2019s claim to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">TRIAL ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">\n<em>Sufficiency of Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">{\u00b6 122} Roberts argues in proposition of law four that the evidence at trial did not sufficiently establish the theft element of aggravated robbery and the corresponding capital specification.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">{\u00b6 123} When we review a record for sufficiency, \u201c[t]he relevant inquiry is whether, after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State v. Jenks </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 574 N.E.2d 492, paragraph two of the syllabus, following <em>Jackson v. Virginia </em>(1979), 443 U.S. 307, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560. \u201c[T]he weight to be given the evidence and the credibility of the witnesses are primarily for the trier of the facts.\u201d <em>State v. DeHass </em>(1967), 10 Ohio St.2d 230, 39 O.O.2d 366, 227 N.E.2d 212, paragraph one of the syllabus. A verdict will not be disturbed on appeal on sufficiency grounds unless \u201creasonable minds could not reach the conclusion reached by the trier-of-fact.\u201d <em>State v. Dennis </em>(1997), 79 Ohio St.3d 421, 430, 683 N.E.2d 1096.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-9\">{\u00b6 124} In her effort to show that the evidence was insufficient to demonstrate theft, Roberts points out that Fingerhut\u2019s wallets, one of which contained large amounts of money, were found with his body after the murder. She then challenges the state\u2019s theory that the theft element was established by Jackson\u2019s use of Fingerhut\u2019s car to escape.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-10\">{\u00b6 125} In her latter analysis, Roberts does not deny that Jackson drove away from the crime scene in Fingerhut\u2019s car. Indeed, the evidence shows that Jackson shot Fingerhut and drove from the scene in Fingerhut\u2019s automobile. Rather than attacking the facts, Roberts argues the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-11\">{\u00b6 126} Roberts claims that the taking of the car does not constitute a theft offense because Jackson did not keep the car or try to sell it, but rather, merely drove it to Youngstown and abandoned it with the keys inside. In other words, she claims that because Jackson merely used the vehicle as a means of escape, taking it cannot constitute a theft offense. We reject that assertion.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-12\">{\u00b6 127} The evidence established that Jackson asserted control over the keys to Fingerhut\u2019s car and the car itself. He therefore deprived Fingerhut of that property. See <em>State v. Biros </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 426, 450, 678 N.E.2d 891. The fact that Jackson did not keep or sell the car for financial gain does not matter; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>the only purpose required for theft is \u201cpurpose to deprive the owner of [the] property\u201d in question. R.C. 2913.02(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">{\u00b6 128} Roberts next challenges the conviction with a contention that there is no evidence that Jackson formed the intent to take Fingerhut\u2019s automobile until after he murdered Fingerhut. Assuming purely arguendo that the evidence supports such a conclusion (and we think it does not), the claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">{\u00b6 129} We repeatedly have rejected the argument that there is no aggravated robbery when the victim\u2019s property is taken after he is murdered. \u201c[T]he victim of a robbery, killed just prior to the robber\u2019s carrying off [his] property, is nonetheless the victim of an aggravated robbery. The victim need not be alive at the time of asportation. A robber cannot avoid the effect of the felony-murder rule by first killing a victim, watching [him] die, and then stealing [his] property after the death.\u201d <em>State v. Smith </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 284, 290, 574 N.E.2d 510. Accord <em>State v. Rojas </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 131, 139, 592 N.E.2d 1376.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">{\u00b6 130} The evidence was sufficient to support a finding that the killing was associated with the aggravated robbery of Fingerhut\u2019s keys and car as part of one continuous occurrence, see <em>State v. Williams </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 569, 577, 660 N.E.2d 724, and we hold the evidence sufficient to support the jury\u2019s verdict beyond a reasonable doubt on the essential elements of aggravated robbery, R.C. 2911.01, and on the R.C. 2929.04(A)(7) capital specification, aggravated robbery in connection with aggravated murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">\n<em>Jury Instructions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">{\u00b6 131} In proposition of law 11, Roberts contends that the trial court erred in instructing the jury on reasonable doubt based on the statutory definition of R.C. 2901.05. During trial, however, she failed to object to the instruction on the basis asserted here. She thus waives all but plain error, <em>State v. Underwood </em>(1983), 3 Ohio St.3d 12, 3 OBR 360, 444 N.E.2d 1332, syllabus, and we find no such error. See <em>State v. Jones </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 403, 417, 739 N.E.2d 300; <em>State v. Jenkins </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 164, 15 OBR 311, 473 N.E.2d 264, paragraph eight of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-9\">SENTENCING ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"A3r\">\n<em>Waiver of Mitigation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b400-10\">{\u00b6 132} In proposition of law one, Roberts contends that a waiver of mitigation evidence is not valid unless the defendant is informed that the waiver will result in the death penalty. In addition, Roberts submits that such a waiver is invalid if the defendant intends to present any mitigation evidence in any form.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>{\u00b6 133} At the outset of the mitigation phase, Roberts informed her counsel that she did not wish to present any mitigating evidence to the jury except an unsworn statement. During the ensuing in camera hearing on this issue, the court explained to Roberts the purpose of the mitigation phase and her right to present mitigation evidence. The judge then inquired as to whether Roberts had instructed her attorneys not to present such evidence; she confirmed that the court\u2019s understanding was correct. Roberts explained to the trial judge that she had talked with her attorneys, family, and friends before declaring, \u201cI know what I am doing. I explained to everyone that cares why I am doing it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">{\u00b6 134} Trial counsel described for the judge the evidence that could be presented in mitigation. Counsel noted that professionally and personally, he disagreed with Roberts\u2019s decision not to present such evidence but that he believed her competent and that the decision was the product of rational thought.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">{\u00b6 135} The court then heard from Dr. Thomas Eberle, a psychologist who had evaluated Roberts earlier during the prosecution and who did so again just prior to the hearing. Dr. Eberle testified that Roberts\u2019s decision to forgo presentation of mitigating evidence was rational. He further found that she suffered no psychiatric or psychological abnormality that would prohibit a rational decision regarding presentation of mitigating evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">{\u00b6 136} Having heard the foregoing testimony, the trial court specifically inquired of Roberts whether she understood that \u201cby waiving the presentation of mitigating evidence, this Jury has little to go upon in coming up with something other than the death penalty.\u201d Roberts replied: \u201cThat is what I hope for. * * * I know what I am doing and I know why. Thank you for asking.\u201d The court then found that the decision to forgo mitigation evidence was a voluntary one made without any reluctance, that Roberts had reiterated that decision repeatedly, and that she appeared relieved to have made it. The court found that Roberts understood that her decision was irrevocable, and it accepted her decision to forgo the presentation of mitigation evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-9\">{\u00b6 137} Roberts later presented an unsworn statement to the jury. In that statement, she told the jury that she would not provide any mitigating evidence. She then said, \u2018You are bound by law to give me one sentence, the death penalty. You have no other choice. That is what I\u2019m asking you to do, because that is the right thing to do.\u201d She reiterated that objective after the trial court sentenced her to death.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-10\">{\u00b6 138} With this factual background in mind, we turn to the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-11\">{\u00b6 139} The United States Supreme Court has never suggested that the Eighth Amendment requires forcing an unwilling defendant to present mitigating evidence in a capital case. <em>State v. Ashworth </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 56, 63, 706 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>N.E.2d 1231. No societal interest counterbalances the defendant\u2019s right to control his or her own defense. <em>Tyler, </em>50 Ohio St.3d at 28, 553 N.E.2d 576.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">{\u00b6 140} We have held that a defendant is entitled to decide what she wants to argue and present as mitigation in the penalty phase, see, e.g., <em>Jenkins, </em>15 Ohio St.3d at 189, 15 OBR 311, 473 N.E.2d 264, citing <em>Lockett v. Ohio </em>(1978), 438 U.S. 586, 604, 98 S.Ct. 2954, 57 L.Ed.2d 973, including the decision to present no evidence. Ohio\u2019s death-penalty statute itself confers \u201cgreat latitude\u201d on a defendant in such decisions. R.C. 2929.04(C). See, also, <em>State v. Barton, </em>108 Ohio St.3d 402, 2006-Ohio-1324, 844 N.E.2d 307, \u00b6 47. Roberts was entitled to present no mitigation evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">{\u00b6 141} Her contention that she did not fully understand the ramifications of her decision and that the trial judge did not sufficiently inquire of her in that regard is belied by the record. As set forth above, the record clearly establishes that the trial judge specifically addressed the likelihood of the jury\u2019s imposing a death sentence if Roberts failed to present mitigating evidence and that she understood that a death sentence was the probable outcome. In fact, Roberts asked the jury to impose that sentence. We reject her claim that she did not understand that the waiver would yield such a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">{\u00b6 142} We now turn to Roberts\u2019s suggestion that her waiver of the right to present mitigation evidence was not a complete waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">{\u00b6 143} Roberts contends that she entered only a \u201cpartial waiver\u201d because she gave an unsworn statement and that a partial waiver does not constitute a valid waiver. Roberts cites no decision to support her assertion, nor are we aware of any such authority. We do recognize, however, our prior holding in <em>State v. Monroe, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 384, 2005-Ohio-2282, 827 N.E.2d 285, \u00b6 72-76, in which we concluded that the requirements of <em>Ashworth, </em>85 Ohio St.3d 56, 706 N.E.2d 1231, paragraph one of the syllabus, do not apply when a defendant makes an unsworn statement and presents minimal evidence in mitigation. Our emphasis in <em>Ash-worth </em>was to require an inquiry of \u201ca defendant only in those situations where the defendant chooses to present <em>no </em>mitigating evidence whatsoever.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Monroe, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 384, 2005-Ohio-2282, 827 N.E.2d 285, \u00b6 74. Here, Roberts presented an unsworn statement. An unsworn statement can constitute critical mitigating evidence. See <em>State v. Scott, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 31, 2004-Ohio-10, 800 N.E.2d 1133, at \u00b6 64; <em>State v. Lynch, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 514, 2003-Ohio-2284, 787 N.E.2d 1185, at \u00b6 110. <em>Barton, </em>108 Ohio St.3d 402, 2006-Ohio-1324, 844 N.E.2d 307, \u00b6 50. We decline to extend <em>Ashworth </em>to the context Roberts presents.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-9\">{\u00b6 144} Moreover, we have never held that a partial waiver of the right to present mitigating evidence is an invalid exercise of that right. To the contrary, we have upheld the death sentences in several cases in which the defendant chose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>to present only an unsworn statement to the jury in mitigation. See <em>State v. Mink, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 350, 2004-Ohio-1580, 805 N.E.2d 1064, \u00b6 113-114; <em>State v. Vrabel, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 184, 2003-Ohio-3193, 790 N.E.2d 303, \u00b6 22; <em>Tyler, </em>50 Ohio St.3d at 28, 553 N.E.2d 576; <em>Barton, </em>108 Ohio St.3d 402, 2006-Ohio-1324, 844 N.E.2d 307, \u00b6 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">{\u00b6 145} In any event, the record reflects that the trial judge complied with the <em>Ashworth </em>requirements. We reject Roberts\u2019s claims of error in the trial court\u2019s decisions with respect to her decision to waive mitigating evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">\n<em>Effective Assistance</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">{\u00b6 146} Similarly, in proposition of law eight, to the extent that Roberts argues that trial counsel were ineffective for failing to properly advise her and ensure that she understood the ramifications of her waiver of her right to present mitigating evidence, her claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">{\u00b6 147} Reversal of a conviction for ineffective assistance \u201crequires showing that counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the \u2018counsel\u2019 guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment. Second, the defendant must show that the deficient performance prejudiced the defendant.\u201d <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674. Accord <em>State v. Bradley </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 538 N.E.2d 373, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-9\">{\u00b6 148} We again reject Roberts\u2019s contentions that she did not understand the full ramifications of waiving her right to present and argue mitigation evidence. The record shows that Roberts understood what she was doing when she decided to present only her unsworn statement during the mitigation hearing. The record also establishes that the trial court explained sufficiently the ramifications of that decision, that Roberts essentially told the trial court that she was not presenting additional mitigating evidence because she wanted to be given a death sentence, and that she disregarded her attorneys\u2019 advice and instead directed them not to present any mitigating evidence beyond her unsworn statement. An attorney does not render ineffective assistance by declining, in deference to a client\u2019s desires, to present evidence in mitigation. See, e.g., <em>State v. Monroe, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 384, 2005-Ohio-2282, 827 N.E.2d 285, \u00b6 100; <em>State v. Cowans </em>(1999), 87 Ohio St.3d 68, 81, 717 N.E.2d 298; <em>State v. Keith </em>(1997), 79 Ohio St.3d 514, 536, 684 N.E.2d 47. Her claims that counsel was constitutionally ineffective fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-10\">\n<em>Cumulative Error</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b403-11\">{\u00b6 149} Although Roberts claims in proposition of law 12 that a combination of errors by the trial court and prosecution and ineffectiveness of counsel deprived her of a fair trial, she offers no analysis of substance to support those claims. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>She thus fails to demonstrate that she was denied a fair trial. <em>State v. Sapp, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 104, 2004-Ohio-7008, 822 N.E.2d 1239, \u00b6 103.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">\n<em>Jury Instructions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">{\u00b6 150} Roberts asserts in proposition of law ten that it was error for the trial court to use the term \u201crecommendation\u201d in its sentencing instructions to the jury. The term \u201crecommendation\u201d in a jury instruction, however, accurately reflects Ohio law and does not constitute prejudicial error. <em>State v. Clemons </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 438, 444, 696 N.E.2d 1009; <em>State v. Carter </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 545, 559, 651 N.E.2d 965.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">\n<em>Proportionality Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">{\u00b6 151} We summarily reject Roberts\u2019s challenges in proposition of law 13 to Ohio\u2019s system of proportionality review in light of our precedent. See <em>State v. Jordan, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 216, 2004-Ohio-783, 804 N.E.2d 1, \u00b6 86; <em>State v. Steffen </em>(1987) , 31 Ohio St.3d 111, 31 OBR 273, 509 N.E.2d 383.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-9\">\n<em>Constitutionality</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b404-10\">{\u00b6 152} We summarily reject Roberts\u2019s various constitutional claims in proposition of law 14. See, e.g., <em>State v. Issa </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 49, 69, 752 N.E.2d 904; <em>State v. Carter </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 593, 608, 734 N.E.2d 345; <em>State v.

Jenkins, </em>15 Ohio St.3d at 167-178,15 OBR 311, 473 N.E.2d 264.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-12\">\n<em>Sentencing Opinion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b404-13\">{\u00b6 153} Having disposed of the substantial majority of Roberts\u2019s claims, we now turn to a critical one. In proposition of law six, Roberts asserts that the trial court erred in allowing the prosecutor to assist in drafting the court\u2019s sentencing opinion. The claim arises from the facts that follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-14\">{\u00b6 154} At the sentencing hearing, the court read aloud its sentencing opinion and imposed the death penalty on Roberts. As the court was doing so, defense counsel noticed that the prosecutor was looking at a document and appeared to be reading along with the trial judge. At the end of the court\u2019s reading, defense counsel raised a \u201cvehement\u201d objection to the prosecution\u2019s apparent ex parte involvement with the sentencing opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>{\u00b6 155} The trial judge conceded that the prosecution had participated in the drafting of the opinion without the knowledge of defense counsel. The trial judge stated that he had given notes to the prosecutor and had instructed the prosecutor, \u201c[TJhis is what I want.\u201d The court added that the opinion had to be corrected six or seven times. The trial judge apologized to defense counsel for not providing them with a copy of the opinion before the sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">{\u00b6 156} R.C. 2929.03 governs the imposition of sentences for aggravated murder. R.C. 2929.03(F) clearly contemplates that the trial court itself will draft the death-sentence opinion: <em>\u201cThe court </em>* * * when it imposes sentence of death, <em>shall state </em>in a separate opinion <em>its </em>specific findings as to the existence of any of the mitigating factors * * *, the aggravating circumstances the offender was found guilty of committing, and the reasons why the aggravating circumstances the offender was found guilty of committing were sufficient to outweigh the mitigating factors * * *.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">{\u00b6 157} Our prior decisions have stressed the crucial role of the trial court\u2019s sentencing opinion in evaluating all of the evidence, including mitigation evidence, and in carefully weighing the specified aggravating circumstances against the mitigating evidence in determining the appropriateness of the death penalty. For example, in <em>State v. Green </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 352, 360, 738 N.E.2d 1208, we vacated the death penalty because the trial court\u2019s sentencing opinion \u201cwas constitutionally deficient.\u201d There, the trial court\u2019s sentencing opinion \u201cimproperly considered nonstatutory aggravating circumstances, and failed to consider relevant mitigating evidence.\u201d Id. We concluded that \u201cthe collective deficiencies in the trial court\u2019s decision to impose the death penalty, as reflected in the sentencing opinion, undermine our confidence in that decision. * * * These cumulative errors reflect grievous violations of the statutory deliberative process.\u201d Id. at 363-364, 738 N.E.2d 1208.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">{\u00b6 158} Similarly, in <em>State v. Davis </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 361, 528 N.E.2d 925, we vacated the death sentence because of grievous errors in the trial court\u2019s sentencing opinion. In <em>Davis, </em>we noted, \u201c[T]he General Assembly has set specific standards in the statutory framework it created to guide a sentencing court\u2019s discretion \u2018by requiring examination of <em>specific factors </em>that argue in favor of or against imposition of the death penalty, thus eliminating total arbitrariness and capriciousness in its imposition.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis sic.) Id. at 372-373, 528 N.E.2d 925, quoting <em>Proffitt v. Florida </em>(1976), 428 U.S. 242, 258, 96 S.Ct. 2960, 49 L.Ed.2d 913.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-9\">{\u00b6 159} In this case, our confidence in the trial court\u2019s sentencing opinion is undermined by the fact that the trial judge directly involved the prosecutor in preparing the sentencing opinion and did so on an ex parte basis. The trial judge is charged by statute with the sole responsibility of personally preparing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>opinion setting forth the assessment and weight of the evidence, the aggravating circumstances of the murder, and any relevant mitigating factors prior to determining what penalty should be imposed. The fact that the trial judge provided his notes to the prosecutor to guide the prosecutor in drafting the sentencing opinion does not change the result. The various drafts of the opinion that ultimately imposed death on Roberts involved the assistance of the prosecutor.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">{\u00b6 160} The trial court\u2019s delegation of any degree of responsibility in this sentencing opinion does not comply with R.C. 2929.03(F). Nor does it comport with our firm belief that the consideration and imposition of death are the most solemn of all the duties that are imposed on a judge, as Ohio courts have recognized. See <em>State v. Vrabel </em>(Mar. 2, 2000), Mahoning App. No. 95 CA 221, 2000 WL 246482, *15 (\u201cThe role of this Court in reviewing a death penalty case is codified by statute and defined by the Ohio Supreme Court. It is a duty of immense proportions which we undertake with great solemnity\u201d). The judge alone serves as the final arbiter of justice in his courtroom, and he must discharge that austere duty in isolation. The scales of justice may not be weighted even slightly by one with an interest in the ultimate outcome. Given the prosecutor\u2019s direct role in the preparation of the sentencing opinion, we cannot conclude that the proper process was followed here.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">{\u00b6 161} That conclusion is compelled particularly in light of the trial court\u2019s ex parte communications about sentencing with the prosecutor in preparing the sentencing opinion. The Code of Judicial Conduct, Canon 3(B)(7) specifies, \u201cA judge shall not initiate, receive, permit, or consider communications made to the judge outside the presence of the parties or their representatives concerning a pending or impending proceeding * * *.\u201d Both the trial judge and the prosecutor should have known that any ex parte assistance in the preparation of the court\u2019s sentencing opinion was wholly inconsistent with these vital ethical constraints. See Disciplinary Rule 7-110(B)(2) and (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">{\u00b6 162} The trial court\u2019s consultation with the prosecutor, particularly when undertaken without the knowledge or participation of defense counsel, can neither be ignored nor found to be harmless error. Cf. <em>Gardner v. Florida </em>(1977), 430 U.S. 349, 362, 97 S.Ct. 1197, 51 L.Ed.2d 393 (defendant \u201cwas denied due process of law when the death sentence was imposed, at least in part, on the basis of information [from a presentence report] which he had no opportunity to deny or explain\u201d). We cannot cure the deficiencies in the preparation of the sentencing opinion by our own independent assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">{\u00b6 163} The trial court\u2019s decision to use the prosecutor in preparing the sentencing opinion constitutes a grievous violation of the statutory deliberative process. It is so severe a violation that independent reweighing cannot serve as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>an adequate remedy. See <em>State v. Green, </em>90 Ohio St.3d at 363-364, 738 N.E.2d 1208. We find that we must vacate the sentence because of the critical constitutional interests and notions of justice that are implicated by the prosecutor\u2019s participation in drafting the sentencing opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">{\u00b6 164} We accordingly sustain Roberts\u2019s claim of error in the trial judge\u2019s use of the prosecutor to assist directly in the preparation of the sentencing opinion. Accordingly, we vacate the sentence and remand to the trial court for resentencing as set forth expressly below.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">\n<em>Allocution Rights</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">{\u00b6 165} Finally, we turn to Roberts\u2019s claim in proposition of law five that the trial court committed reversible error by not affording Roberts the right of allocution before announcing the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-9\">{\u00b6 166} Crim.R. 32(A)(1) provides that before imposing sentence in a criminal trial, the trial court shall \u201caddress the defendant personally\u201d and ask whether he or she wishes to make a statement on her own behalf or present any information in mitigation of punishment. Because we have vacated the death sentence and remanded the case, this issue is now moot. The trial court shall provide Roberts with her right of allocution before imposing any new sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-10\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b407-11\">{\u00b6 167} Having found no prejudicial error in regard to Roberts\u2019s convictions, we affirm the convictions and the judgment of the trial court pertaining to them. Because of the prejudicial error in sentencing Roberts to death, the sentence of death is vacated, and the cause is hereby remanded to the trial court. On remand, the trial judge will afford Roberts her right to allocute, and the trial court shall personally review and evaluate the evidence, weigh the aggravating circumstances against any relevant mitigating evidence, and determine anew the appropriateness of the death penalty as required by R.C. 2929.03. The trial court will then personally prepare an entirely new penalty opinion as required by R.C. 2929.03(F) and conduct whatever other proceedings are required by law and consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-12\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b407-13\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Donnell and Lanzinger, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<attorneys id=\"b408-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>Dennis Watkins, Trumbull County Prosecuting Attorney, and LuWayne Annos, Assistant Prosecuting Attorney, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b408-5\">David L.
