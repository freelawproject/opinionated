Respondent filed an answer to the complaint, and a panel of the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline held a hearing on the complaint in November 2005. The panel then prepared written findings of fact and conclusions of law, which the board adopted, as well as a recommended sanction, which the board modified.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-9\">Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b662-10\">{\u00b6 3} Barbara A. Gombita of Bedford Heights, Ohio, died on May 27, 2002. In accordance with Gombita\u2019s will, Gombita\u2019s sister, Gertrude Karvelas, was named the executor and sole beneficiary of the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-11\">{\u00b6 4} In June 2002, Karvelas retained respondent\u2019s law firm to administer Gombita\u2019s estate. Karvelas paid respondent a $500 retainer plus $200 for court costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-12\">{\u00b6 5} From June 2002 until March 2003, Karvelas spoke regularly with respondent about the estate. Each time they spoke, respondent assured Karvelas that he was taking care of all probate matters for her. In November 2003, respondent told Karvelas that the estate would be finalized by the end of that year.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-13\">{\u00b6 6} Starting in 2004, Karvelas began to call respondent often, but he rarely returned the calls. When Karvelas was able to speak with respondent in May 2004, he promised to send her the necessary papers to close the estate\u2019s bank accounts. Respondent failed to send the paperwork. Karvelas then called the Cuyahoga County Probate Court, and she learned that no documents had been filed there in connection with the Gombita estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-14\">{\u00b6 7} Karvelas terminated respondent\u2019s services in June 2004 and asked that the case file be sent to Karvelas\u2019s new attorney. The case file was promptly sent to the new attorney, but respondent did not provide a $700 refund to Karvelas until June 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-15\">{\u00b6 8} The board found that respondent had violated DR 1~102(A)(4) (prohibiting conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation), 1~102(A)(5) (barring conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice), 6-101(A)(3) (prohibiting a lawyer from neglecting an entrusted legal matter), 7~101(A)(1) (barring an attorney from intentionally failing to seek the lawful objectives of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>client), and 7-101(A)(2) (prohibiting an attorney from intentionally failing to carry out a contract of professional employment).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">{\u00b6 9} In recommending a sanction for this misconduct, the board considered the aggravating and mitigating factors listed in Section 10 of the Rules and Regulations Governing Procedure on Complaints and Hearings Before the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline (\u201cBCGD Proc.Reg.\u201d). The board cited several mitigating factors: the absence of a prior disciplinary record, the absence of a dishonest or selfish motive, a timely and good-faith effort to provide restitution or to rectify the consequences of the misconduct, the respondent\u2019s full and free disclosure to the board and his cooperative attitude toward the disciplinary process, and respondent\u2019s good character. BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2)(a), (b), (c), (d), and (e).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">{\u00b6 10} Relator recommended that respondent be suspended from the practice of law for six months, and the panel adopted that recommendation. However, the board concluded that respondent should be suspended for six months, with the entire suspension stayed.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-8\">'{\u00b6 11} We accept the board\u2019s factual findings, although we agree with the panel\u2019s recommended sanction rather than the more lenient sanction proposed by the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-9\">{\u00b6 12} Dishonest conduct on the part of an attorney generally warrants an actual suspension from the practice of law. See, e.g., <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Beeler, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 188, 2005-Ohio-1143, 824 N.E.2d 78, \u00b6 44 (\u201cA violation of DR 1-102(A)(4) ordinarily calls for the actual suspension of an attorney\u2019s license\u201d); <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Fowerbaugh </em>(1995), 74 Ohio St.3d 187, 191, 658 N.E.2d 237 (\u201cwhen an attorney engages in a course of conduct that violates DR 1-102(A)(4), the attorney will be actually suspended from the practice of law for an appropriate period of time\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-10\">{\u00b6 13} Although we acknowledge the various mitigating factors noted by the board, those factors do not warrant a departure from the ordinary rule that an actual suspension should be imposed for dishonest conduct, particularly when that conduct is designed to \u201cmislead a court or client.\u201d <em>Akron Bar Assn. v. Holder, </em>102 Ohio St.3d 307, 2004-Ohio-2835, 810 N.E.2d 426, \u00b6 43 (imposing a two-year suspension, with 18 months stayed).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-11\">{\u00b6 14} Accordingly, respondent is hereby suspended from the practice of law in Ohio for six months. Costs are taxed to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-12\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b663-13\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell and Lanzinger, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<attorneys id=\"b664-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>Jonathan E.
