This cause is pending before the court as a discretionary appeal and claimed appeal of right. It appears from the records of the court that the appellant has not filed a memorandum in support of jurisdiction, due July 21, 2006, in compliance with the Rules of Practice of the Supreme Court and therefore has failed to prosecute this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1430\">*1430</page-number>cause with the requisite diligence.
