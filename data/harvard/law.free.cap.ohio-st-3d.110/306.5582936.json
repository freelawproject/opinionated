For the reasons that follow, we reject all of them except proposition of law X. We have also independently weighed each aggravating circumstance against the mitigating factors and compared the sentence of death to those imposed in similar cases. We affirm the convictions and the sentence of death on the aggravated murder charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-11\">{\u00b62} On February 28, 1996, at around 6:00 p.m., 12-year-old Roseanna Davenport was walking to her home in Akron, Ohio. Along the way, appellant Donald Craig abducted her, then raped and murdered her. Davenport\u2019s body was discovered in the basement of a vacant duplex in Akron on March 5, 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-12\">{\u00b6 3} Police did not solve this murder for six years. In April 2002, DNA testing identified Craig as Davenport\u2019s murderer. Subsequently, Craig was tried and convicted of aggravated murder and sentenced to death.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-13\">{\u00b6 4} Davenport and 15-year-old Esther Trijah Stone were friends who lived about a mile apart. Davenport often visited Stone at her home on 111 South Maple Street and once spent the night there. Craig was the boyfriend of Stone\u2019s mother, Michelle Lindsay, and lived at the Lindsay home. Craig knew Davenport from these visits. After school on February 28, 1996, Davenport went to Lindsay\u2019s home to play with Stone. Davenport told Patricia Huffman, the live-in girlfriend of her father Jerry Davenport, that she would be home by 6:00 p.m. At the Lindsay home, Davenport and Stone talked and watched television. Around 6:00 p.m., Lindsay called a taxi to take Davenport home because it was getting dark outside. Davenport, however, left before the taxi arrived. Craig was in the living room of the Lindsay home when Davenport departed; he left five to ten minutes later.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>{\u00b6 5} When Davenport failed to return home by 7:30 p.m., Huffman drove to Lindsay\u2019s home to check on her. Lindsay told Huffman that Davenport had left their house at 6:00 p.m. Huffman then drove around the neighborhood searching for Davenport. The police were notified that Davenport was missing at about 10:00 p.m. Over the next few days, Jerry Davenport and Huffman searched the neighborhood and distributed flyers seeking information about Davenport.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">{\u00b6 6} Michael Johnson bought, fixed, and rented houses. On February 28 or 29, 1996, he viewed the outside of two duplexes on South Maple Street for possible purchase. Each duplex contained two apartments; the apartments at 156 South Maple were vacant. On March 1, Johnson returned to 156 South Maple and entered the building after finding the front door unlocked. He saw trash everywhere, including clothes and upside-down chairs. He also looked in the basement but could not walk around or even \u201csee the floor [because] there was so much stuff down there.\u201d Johnson locked the doors to the apartments before departing.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">{\u00b6 7} On March 2, after making an offer to purchase the apartments, Johnson returned to \u201ctake a peek\u201d at the property. He noticed that the apartment doors were still locked, and he saw no signs of breaking or entering. Upon learning that his offer to purchase had been accepted, Johnson started cleaning the apartments. On March 5, he entered the basement of the apartment at 156 South Maple and discovered a fully clothed body under a pile of clothing. Johnson called 911.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">{\u00b6 8} Police officers observed that the murder victim had a large abrasion across her neck and multiple injuries on much of her body. Her bra was also rolled up above her breast line. Police investigators collected fibers and carpet samples from the crime scene; they found no usable fingerprints. On the evening of March 5, the murder victim was identified as Roseanna Davenport.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-9\">{\u00b6 9} On March 6, Dr. Roberto Ruiz, the Chief Deputy Coroner for Summit County, conducted an autopsy. He concluded that Davenport had suffered multiple injuries involving the head and neck, the chest, the abdomen, genitalia, and extremities and that Davenport had died as the result of cardiorespiratory arrest due to strangulation. Dr. Ruiz found extensive vaginal injuries. The left labia major was bruised, the vulva was lacerated, and the minor labia had a small area of hemorrhage. Testing of a vaginal swab taken from Roseanna was positive for the presence of semen. Multiple lacerations were also found around the outer edge of the anal opening. The lining of the anus was hemorrhagic, and the anus was dilated. A mouth swab taken from Davenport indicated the likelihood that semen was present.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-10\">{\u00b6 10} The vaginal and anal injuries were consistent with penetration. Inflammation in the vaginal and rectal mucosa established that the vaginal and anal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>penetration had occurred before Davenport had been strangled. Based on the autopsy findings, the county\u2019s chief medical examiner, Dr. Lisa J. Kohler, estimated that death had occurred from three days to a week before Davenport\u2019s body had been found.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">{\u00b6 11} As the investigation progressed, Craig and several other individuals were identified as suspects. On March 11, Detective William Smith talked to Craig and asked him if he had ever seen Davenport. Craig said that \u201c[h]e had not seen her, did not know her.\u201d On March 14, the police collected blood, hair, and saliva samples from Craig. The police also collected blood, hair, and saliva samples from other suspects including Duane Craig, the defendant\u2019s brother, Eran Riggins, Maurice Cummings, Aaron Trent, the victim\u2019s uncle, Frederick Frazier, and James Davenport, another uncle of the victim. Investigators also searched Craig\u2019s residence and collected hair and fiber samples.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">{\u00b6 12} In 1996, Mandy Allen and Davenport had been friends and roller-skated together. A few days before Davenport disappeared, a man had chased them while they were roller-skating. According to Allen, the police had been notified and the man had been arrested. Allen also testified that she had seen Davenport in the back of somebody\u2019s car on March 2,1996. During cross-examination, Allen testified that she and Davenport had gone to Esther Stone\u2019s home together, and that she had seen Craig touch Davenport\u2019s leg a \u201cfew times.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">{\u00b6 13} Eran Riggins lived at the Lindsay home for two weeks during February and March 1996. While he was there, Riggins saw Duane Craig, the defendant\u2019s brother, lying on top of Davenport. Riggins never saw Donald Craig do anything inappropriate with Davenport. During cross-examination, Riggins testified that Craig told him that Davenport was fast and loose.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-8\">{\u00b6 14} On March 19, 1996, after seeing Davenport\u2019s picture in the paper, Yashica Clark notified police that she had seen Davenport and another girl walking down the street near the corner of Bittman and Maple Street on March 2, 1996. During cross-examination, Clark testified that she was \u201cnot absolutely sure\u201d that the girl she had seen was Davenport.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-9\">{\u00b6 15} During February and March 1996, Frederick Frazier lived near Bittman and Maple Street. Frazier admitted that he was a suspect in Davenport\u2019s murder, stating that police officers had questioned him several times and that he had provided hair and blood samples.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-10\">{\u00b6 16} During February and March 1996, Maurice Cummings was homeless, but sometimes stayed with a friend who lived \u201caround the corner\u201d from the building where Davenport\u2019s body had been found. Cummings testified that he was a suspect in Davenport\u2019s murder, that police officers had interviewed him, and that he had provided hair and blood samples.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>{\u00b6 17} Beverly Bacote lived behind the duplex where Davenport\u2019s body was found. Cummings lived three doors down from Bacote\u2019s residence. Bacote testified that she had seen Cummings walking near the duplex where the body was found on March 5, but that she had not seen Cummings and Davenport together. Akron Detective Steven Geiger interviewed Bacote during the homicide investigation. He testified that Bacote told him that she had seen Cummings talking to Davenport near the South Maple Street duplex on March 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">{\u00b6 18} Evidence collected during the investigation and the autopsy was sent for testing to the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Identification and Investigation (\u201cBCI\u201d). Semen was found in a stain on the crotch of Davenport\u2019s underwear. The tests conducted at BCI did not establish a link between Craig, or the other suspects, and Davenport\u2019s murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">{\u00b6 19} There was no further DNA testing by BCI because the agency did not perform DNA typing in 1996. Subsequently, the vaginal and rectal swabs and blood swatches from Davenport, blood swatches from the suspects, and a cutting from Davenport\u2019s underwear were submitted to Cellmark Laboratory for DNA testing. Only a few sperm cells could be extracted from the underwear. The forensic examiner was unable to obtain sufficient DNA from the sperm fractions to type and use for comparison.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-8\">{\u00b6 20} Davenport\u2019s murder was unsolved for several years. In January 2002, as a result of reviewing cold-case files, Akron Detective James Pasheilich resubmitted some of the forensic evidence to BCI for new DNA testing. Linda Eveleth, a DNA examiner at BCI, testified that she used a type of DNA testing (short tandem repeat polymerase chain reaction) that had not been available in 1996. DNA tests were conducted on the blood samples from the suspects, on the underwear, and on the rectal and vaginal swabs. Testing established that \u201c[t]he DNA profile from the sperm fraction of the panties * * * is a mixture consistent with contributions from Roseanna Davenport * * * and Donald Craig.\u201d Further testing established that \u201c[t]he partial DNA profile from the sperm fraction of the vaginal swab * * * is a mixture. The partial major DNA profile is consistent with Donald Craig * * *. The partial minor profile is consistent with Roseanna Davenport.\u201d According to Eveleth, the probability of a particular individual contributing to the partial major DNA profile identified from the sperm fraction of the vaginal swab was one in 973,700,000,000,000 Caucasians, one in 222,200,-000,000,000 African-Americans, and one in 4,005,000,000,000,000 Hispanics.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-9\">{\u00b6 21} The grand jury indicted Craig for the aggravated murder of Roseanna Davenport while committing or attempting to commit kidnapping or rape. The count also contained three death-penalty specifications: (1) murder while committing, attempting to commit, or fleeing after committing rape, and Craig was the principal offender in the commission of the murder, in violation of R.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>2929.04(A)(7), (2) murder while committing, attempting to commit, or fleeing after committing kidnapping, and Craig was the principal offender in the commission of the murder, in violation of R.C. 2929.04(A)(7), and (3) murder for the purpose of escaping detection or apprehension for the rape or kidnapping, in violation of R.C. 2929.04(A)(3). Craig was also charged with three counts of rape: count two charged rape, by vaginal intercourse, of a person under the age of 13; count three charged rape, by anal intercourse, of a person under the age of 13; and count four charged rape, by fellatio, of a person under the age of 13. Count five charged Craig with kidnapping of a person under the age of 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">{\u00b6 22} At Craig\u2019s arraignment, a magistrate, on Craig\u2019s behalf, entered a plea of not guilty to all the charges. The jury found Craig guilty of the charges and recommended the death penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">{\u00b6 23} The cause is now before this court upon an appeal as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">{\u00b6 24} <em>Motion to suppress DNA evidence. </em>In proposition of law I, Craig argues that the trial court erred in failing to exclude the DNA test results because his blood samples had been obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. On March 11, 1996, Judge Maxson, of the Akron Municipal Court, signed an order requiring Craig \u201cto submit to the taking of hair, saliva and blood samples.\u201d Upon being served with the court order later that evening, Craig told police that, on the advice of counsel, he would not submit to the taking of any body samples. On March 12, an order was issued for Craig\u2019s arrest for contempt of court and a search warrant was authorized for the taking of Craig\u2019s blood, hair, and saliva samples.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-8\">{\u00b6 25} Officer Gerald Kelley listed the following facts and circumstances in the affidavit requesting the search warrant:</p>\n<p id=\"b622-9\">{\u00b6 26} \u201c3. Affiant states that he is aware through incident * * * and investigative reports of the Akron Police Department that Rosanna Davenport, age 12, died at the location of 156 South Maple Street, Akron, Summit County, Ohio and that her body was discovered on March 5, 1996. * * * Affiant attended the autopsy of said child, which autopsy revealed that the child had been raped anally and vaginally, and that her anus was expanded to an extreme measure. Samples of suspect semen were recovered and sent to Ohio BCI &amp; I.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-10\">{\u00b6 27} \u201c4. The APD report of the statement of Michelle Lindsey states that Lindsey witnessed the victim at the home of Donald Craig the two weeks before the discovery of the victim\u2019s body. Lindsey [s]tates the victim left the home at that time. Lindsey is the girl friend of Craig and lives at the 111 Maple Street premises. Det. Smith, however, spoke to Donald Craig after the body was discovered. Craig denied knowing Davenport even though she stayed at his house shortly before her death. The last confirmed sighting of Davenport alive was by Susan Hackathorn on the date of March 2, 1996 at the location of 126 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>South Maple Street. * * * Justin Flanagan, age 12, also saw Davenport on such date in the same area. Flanagan also believed he saw her on the 4th of March *5* H* ^</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">{\u00b6 28} \u201c5. Affiant is aware that Donald had been accused on three earlier occasions of illegal sexual contact, certain of the prior allegations involving minor victims. Affiant is also aware that Craig has spent time in the Grafton State Correctional Facility.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">{\u00b6 29} Later on March 12, police officers contacted Craig, who again refused to provide samples. Craig was then arrested pursuant to the contempt citation and the search warrant and was taken into custody. On March 13, Craig appeared in court, where he was informed that he would remain in jail until the search warrant had been executed and until he agreed to provide the samples. Craig then agreed to provide body samples and was taken to a hospital, where the samples were taken. Thereafter, the contempt charges were dismissed, and Craig was released from jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-9\">{\u00b6 30} In a motion to suppress, the defense sought to exclude the DNA evidence. The trial court overruled the motion, stating: \u201cConsidering the totality of the information contained in the affidavit, any magistrate or judge would have a substantial basis to make a probable cause determination. The statements in the affidavit are not mere conclusions. The affidavit furnishes details about the crime and why law enforcement believes that Donald Craig may have committed the homicide. After reviewing the affidavit as a whole, the Court finds there was a substantial basis for Judge Carr to make her probable cause determination in her role as a neutral and detached magistrate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b623-10\">{\u00b6 31} Craig argues that his body samples were taken in violation of the Fourth Amendment because the samples were obtained based on a court order and not on a search warrant. The search warrant was issued on March 12. Craig was brought into court on the next day, when he was advised that he would remain in jail until he complied with the search warrant and provided the samples. It is clear that the search warrant, not the court order, was the basis for obtaining Craig\u2019s samples on March 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-11\">{\u00b6 32} Craig also argues that the samples could not have been taken pursuant to the search warrant because the warrant was not served on him and the inventory page was never completed. The record shows, however, that the warrant was duly issued and that the police officers had a copy of it when they went to Craig\u2019s residence. Moreover, the judge discussed the meaning and effect of the warrant when Craig was brought into court the next day, prior to the taking of the samples. It is not clear from the record whether the warrant was served on Craig. The inventory page was never completed. We conclude that Craig suffered no prejudice from these technical violations. He actually received <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>greater notice than that given in a warrant because he was brought before the judge who issued the warrant. These technical violations do not rise to the level of constitutional error. See <em>State v. Wilmoth </em>(1986), 22 Ohio St.3d 251, 262, 22 OBR 427, 490 N.E.2d 1236 (police failure to submit a written affidavit to obtain a search warrant was not a violation of constitutional magnitude); <em>State v. Downs </em>(1977), 51 Ohio St.2d 47, 5 O.O.3d 30, 364 N.E.2d 1140, paragraph eight of the syllabus (exclusionary rule does not apply when officers fail to return a search warrant and prepare an inventory pursuant to Crim.R. 41(D) and (E)).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">{\u00b6 33} Craig also argues that the affidavit supporting the search warrant was insufficient to establish probable cause. In <em>Illinois v. Gates </em>(1983), 462 U.S. 213, 238, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 76 L.Ed.2d 527, the Supreme Court stated: \u201cThe task of the issuing magistrate is simply to make a practical, common-sense decision whether, given all the circumstances set forth in the affidavit before him, including the \u2018veracity\u2019 and \u2018basis of knowledge\u2019 of persons supplying hearsay information, there is a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place.\u201d In <em>State v. George </em>(1989), 45 Ohio St.3d 325, 544 N.E.2d 640, paragraph two of the syllabus, we stated: \u201cIn conducting any after-the-fact scrutiny of an affidavit submitted in support of a search warrant, trial and appellate courts should accord great deference to the magistrate\u2019s determination of probable cause, and doubtful or marginal cases in this area should be resolved in favor of upholding the warrant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">{\u00b6 34} The affidavit stated that Roseanna Davenport had been at Craig\u2019s residence in the weeks before she disappeared, that her body had been found in an unoccupied apartment near Craig\u2019s residence, and that when police questioned Craig after Davenport\u2019s body had been found, he \u201cdenied knowing Davenport even though she stayed at his house shortly before her death.\u201d The affidavit also stated that Davenport had been raped, that semen samples had been recovered during the autopsy, and that those samples had been sent to BCI for testing. Finally, the affidavit stated that Craig had been accused of sexual contact with minor victims on at least three separate occasions and that Craig had spent time in a correctional facility. See <em>United States v. Taylor </em>(C.A.1, 1993), 985 F.2d 3, 6 (\u201cAn affiant\u2019s knowledge of the target\u2019s prior criminal activity or record clearly is material to the probable cause determination\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">{\u00b6 35} The facts in the affidavit gave the judge issuing the warrant a substantial basis for concluding that a fair probability existed that comparison of Craig\u2019s hair, blood, and saliva with the semen evidence would identify Craig as the perpetrator. Thus, the affidavit supported the determination of probable cause. Finally, \u201cthe deference accorded the magistrate\u2019s determination of probable cause\u201d compels us to conclude that the search warrant was valid. See <em>State v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number><em>Jordan, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 216, 2004-Ohio-783, 804 N.E.2d 1, \u00b6 43, citing <em>George, </em>45 Ohio St.3d 325, 544 N.E.2d 640, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">{\u00b6 36} We reject proposition of law I.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">{\u00b6 37} <em>\u201cOther acts\u201d evidence of rape. </em>In proposition of law II, Craig argues that the trial court erred in admitting evidence that Craig had previously raped Lavail Calhoun. Over defense objection, Lavail Calhoun testified that she had met Craig in 1991 when she was 17 years old. Calhoun stated that Craig came by her house one evening, and while they were going to the store, Craig stopped at a house where \u201c[h]e said he was house sitting for somebody.\u201d After checking the house, Craig told Calhoun that the house had been broken into and drove to a pay phone to call the police. They then returned to the house. Calhoun asked to use the bathroom, and they both entered the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-8\">{\u00b6 38} Inside the house, Craig threw a sheet over Calhoun, carried her to a second-story bedroom, and flung her on a bed. While taking Calhoun upstairs, Craig told her to be quiet or he was going to kill her. Craig tied Calhoun\u2019s hands to the bedposts, taped her mouth shut, and removed her pants and underwear. He then vaginally raped Calhoun and unsuccessfully tried to anally rape her.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-9\">{\u00b6 39} When Craig finished, he untied Calhoun. She got dressed, and he drove her home. Calhoun\u2019s mother then called the police and reported the attack. After being examined at the hospital, Calhoun took police to the house where the attack had occurred. She later testified before a grand jury. The grand jury returned a no bill, and Craig was never prosecuted for Calhoun\u2019s rape.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-10\">{\u00b6 40} Akron Police Officer Jerry Hughes testified that on April 28, 1991, Calhoun reported that she had been raped by a black male named \u201cDonald\u201d and that she had provided a description of him. On the way to the hospital, Calhoun showed Officer Hughes the house where the attack had occurred and said that the man had been driving a gray Volvo.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-11\">{\u00b6 41} Akron Police Officer Gerald Miles testified that on May 7,1991, when he went to Craig\u2019s residence to assist in serving a felony warrant, Craig had been arrested. At the time of the arrest, a gray Volvo was parked in Craig\u2019s driveway.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-12\">{\u00b6 42} The trial court admitted Calhoun\u2019s medical records from Akron Children\u2019s Hospital relating to her medical treatment and condition following the rape.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-13\">{\u00b6 43} Under Evid.R. 404(B), \u201c[ejvidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove\u201d a defendant\u2019s character as to criminal propensity. \u201cIt may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.\u201d \u201cThe admission or exclusion of relevant evidence rests within the sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d <em>State v. Sage </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 173, 31 OBR 375, 510 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>N.E.2d 343, paragraph two of the syllabus. In order \u201c[t]o be admissible to prove identity through a certain <em>modus opemndi, </em>other-acts evidence must be related to and share common features with the crime in question.\u201d <em>State v. Lowe </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 527, 634 N.E.2d 616, paragraph one of the syllabus. See <em>State v. Jamison </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 182, 552 N.E.2d 180, syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">{\u00b6 44} Several common features link Davenport\u2019s murder and the incident with Calhoun. Both victims were young girls. Craig took both victims to a vacant building, where he restrained and raped them. Craig vaginally raped both victims, anally raped Davenport, and attempted to anally rape Calhoun. Craig allowed Calhoun to get dressed after she was raped and apparently did the same for Davenport. The evidence of the first rape tends to show the identity of the perpetrator of the second. Therefore, evidence of Craig\u2019s prior rape of Calhoun meets the requirements for admissibility in order to show proof of identity, as permitted by Evid.R. 404(B). See <em>State v. Shedrick </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 331, 338, 574 N.E.2d 1065 (sufficient commonality existed between prior rape and charged rape to permit evidence of prior rape to prove identity, plan, scheme, or system). There were differences between the rape of Calhoun and the rape and murder of Davenport, but \u201c[admissibility is not adversely affected simply because the other [crimes] differed in some details.\u201d <em>Jamison, </em>49 Ohio St.3d at 187, 552 N.E.2d 180. Accord <em>State v. Noting, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 44, 2002-Ohio-7044, 781 N.E.2d 88, \u00b6 46.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">{\u00b6 45} Calhoun\u2019s testimony also helped to establish Craig\u2019s motive for murdering Roseanna to escape detection or apprehension. See Evid.R. 404(B). After Calhoun was raped and released, she immediately notified police that Craig had raped her, and he was arrested. The evidence supports the state\u2019s argument that Craig killed Davenport so that she could not notify the police that he had kidnapped and raped her.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">{\u00b6 46} Craig argues that Calhoun\u2019s testimony was inadmissible because the 1991 rape and the 1996 rape-homicide were too removed in time. In <em>State v. DePina </em>(1984), 21 Ohio App.3d 91, 92, 21 OBR 97, 486 N.E.2d 1155, the court of appeals stated that although \u201cother acts evidence aimed at showing an idiosyncratic pattern of conduct should not be so remote from the offense charged as to render them non-probative, logic does not require that they necessarily be near the offense at issue in both place and time. * * * The key to the probative value of such conduct lies in its peculiar character rather than its proximity to the event at issue.\u201d We conclude that the five-year separation in time between these two incidents does not preclude the admissibility of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-8\">{\u00b6 47} Moreover, the trial court instructed the jury:</p>\n<p id=\"b626-9\">{\u00b6 48} \u201cEvidence was received about the commission of other acts alleged to have been committed by the defendant in 1991 involving Lavail Calhoun. That <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>evidence was received only for a limited purpose. It was not received, and you may not consider it, to prove the character of the defendant in order to show that he acted in conformity with that character in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">{\u00b6 49} \u201cIf you find that the evidence of the other acts is true and that the defendant committed them, you may consider that evidence only for the purpose of deciding whether it proves, one, the defendant\u2019s motive, intent, or purpose to commit the crime of aggravated murder charged in this trial, or two, the identity of the person who committed the offenses in this trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">{\u00b6 50} \u201cThis evidence cannot be considered by you for any other purpose.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">{\u00b6 51} A similarly worded cautionary instruction was provided to the jury before Calhoun testified. In view of these instructions and the probative value of Calhoun\u2019s testimony, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting this \u201cother acts\u201d evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-9\">{\u00b6 52} Finally, Craig argues that Calhoun\u2019s testimony was inadmissible because the grand jury returned a no bill on the rape charges. \u201cOther acts\u201d evidence need be proved only by substantial proof. <em>Jamison, </em>49 Ohio St.3d at 187, 552 N.E.2d 180. Thus, the grand jury\u2019s disposition of the rape charges did not affect the admissibility of Calhoun\u2019s testimony at Craig\u2019s trial. See <em>Dowling v. United States </em>(1990), 493 U.S. 342, 349-350, 110 S.Ct. 668, 107 L.Ed.2d 708 (\u201cother acts\u201d evidence not barred even though the accused had previously been acquitted of the crime).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-10\">{\u00b6 53} We reject proposition of law II.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-11\">{\u00b6 54} <em>Witness\u2019s sexual history. </em>In proposition of law IV, Craig argues that the trial court erred in not allowing him to question Calhoun about her sexual history. Calhoun\u2019s medical records relating to her treatment following the rape were offered as state\u2019s exhibit 122. The records indicated that Calhoun had had sexual intercourse about two weeks prior to the rape. Her physical examination revealed an old hymenal tear. Older medical charts showed that Calhoun had been treated after she was hit in the face by a drunk uncle and for ETOH (ethyl alcohol) abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-12\">{\u00b6 55} Before Calhoun testified, the defense argued that the introduction of Calhoun\u2019s medical records would enable it to question her about her sexual activity around the time of the rape. The trial court ruled that the defense could not ask Calhoun about her prior sexual activity. The trial court permitted the reference to the hymenal tear to remain in the medical records but ordered the prosecutor to redact references to Calhoun\u2019s prior sexual activity, the ETOH poisoning, and the assault by the drunk uncle. The reference to the ETOH poisoning and the attack by the drunk uncle were removed from state\u2019s exhibit 122. The prosecutor, however, failed to remove the reference to Calhoun\u2019s prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>sexual intercourse. No prejudice to Craig resulted because that evidence could only have benefited the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">{\u00b6 56} Craig argues that he had the right to question Calhoun about her sexual history to show that he was not responsible for the hymenal tear mentioned in her medical records. He also claims that the jury was entitled to hear that evidence because the rape charge against him had not been prosecuted.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">{\u00b6 57} R.C. 2907.02(D), Ohio\u2019s rape shield statute, provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">{\u00b6 58} \u201cEvidence of specific instances of the victim\u2019s sexual activity, opinion evidence of the victim\u2019s sexual activity, and reputation evidence of the victim\u2019s sexual activity shall not be admitted under this section unless it involves evidence of the origin of semen, pregnancy, or disease, or the victim\u2019s past sexual activity with the offender, and only to the extent that the court finds that the evidence is material to a fact at issue in the case and that its inflammatory or prejudicial nature does not outweigh its probative value.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b628-8\">{\u00b6 59} \u201cEvidence of the victim\u2019s prior sexual activity with a person other than the defendant is inadmissible unless it relates to the \u2018origin of semen, pregnancy, or disease.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Ferguson </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 160, 164, 5 OBR 380, 450 N.E.2d 265, quoting R.C. 2907.02(D). Craig\u2019s purpose for questioning Calhoun about her past sexual activity does not meet any of the exceptions to the rape shield law. Craig did not allege that he had previously engaged in sexual relations with Calhoun, and Calhoun denied having sexual activity with Craig other than when he raped her. Thus, the reference to the hymenal tear in Calhoun\u2019s medical records had nothing to do with her alleged rape by Craig. Accordingly, we conclude that trial court did not abuse its discretion by not permitting the defense to question Calhoun about her sexual history.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-9\">{\u00b6 60} We reject proposition of law IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-10\">{\u00b6 61} <em>Evidence of drug use. </em>In proposition of law III, Craig argues that he was deprived of a fair trial because the state presented evidence of his illicit drug use. Michelle Lindsay testified that she and Craig had smoked crack cocaine and marijuana when they lived together in 1996. The defense did not object to this testimony; therefore, Craig has forfeited all but plain error. Crim.R. 52(B); <em>State v. Gross, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 121, 2002-Ohio-5524, 776 N.E.2d 1061, \u00b6 44. Even though Lindsay\u2019s testimony about Craig\u2019s drug use was irrelevant and tended to portray Craig in a negative light, no plain error resulted from admitting the testimony. <em>Gross </em>at \u00b6 48 (\u201cother act\u201d of purchasing crack cocaine was of minor significance compared to the gravity of the aggravated murder counts).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-11\">{\u00b6 62} We reject proposition of law III.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-12\">{\u00b6 63} <em>Excluding evidence about another suspect. </em>In proposition of law V, Craig argues that he was denied the right to elicit testimony that another suspect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>might have raped and murdered Davenport. Before Detective Washington Lacy testified, the state sought to prohibit the defense from eliciting information that at the time of Davenport\u2019s murder, Aaron Trent, the victim\u2019s uncle, was under investigation for raping her. The defense argued that this evidence would show why Trent had been a suspect for Davenport\u2019s rape and murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">{\u00b6 64} The trial court ruled that testimony about the earlier rape met none of the criteria for admissibility under R.C. 2907.02(D). The trial court found that \u201csuch evidence would be more prejudicial than probative, and inflammatory, and confuse the jury in this, case.\u201d The trial court then ordered the defense not to introduce any testimony about the earlier rape or cross-examine any of the state\u2019s witnesses about that incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">{\u00b6 65} During a subsequent proffer, trial counsel stated that they would have asked Detective Lacy \u201cwhy Aaron Trent was considered a suspect, why he was interviewing him, and specifically if he had knowledge * * * of the rape investigation that was still ongoing at the time of Rosie Davenport\u2019s death.\u201d Trial counsel also averred that Detective Jan Falcone, the police investigator on the earlier rape charge, would have testified that Trent was a suspect in Davenport\u2019s murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-8\">{\u00b6 66} Craig argues that the rape shield statute does not prevent him from presenting evidence that Trent was under investigation for an earlier rape of Davenport. He argues that restricting the admission of this evidence violated his right to confront witnesses against him and infringed on his ability to present a defense. \u201cThe rights to confront witnesses and to defend are not absolute and may bow to accommodate other legitimate interests in the criminal process.\u201d <em>State v. Boggs </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 418, 422, 588 N.E.2d 813. In determining whether the rape shield law would unconstitutionally infringe on a defendant\u2019s rights, a court must \u201cbalance the state interest which the statute is designed to protect against the probative value of the excluded evidence.\u201d <em>State v. Gardner </em>(1979), 59 Ohio St.2d 14, 17, 13 O.O.3d 8, 391 N.E.2d 337.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-9\">{\u00b6 67} Several legitimate state interests are advanced by the rape shield law. \u201cFirst, by guarding the complainant\u2019s sexual privacy and protecting her from undue harassment, the law discourages the tendency in rape cases to try the victim rather than the defendant. In line with this, the law may encourage the reporting of rape, thus aiding crime prevention. Finally, by excluding evidence that is unduly inflammatory and prejudicial, while being only marginally probative, the statute is intended to aid in the truth-finding process.\u201d Id. The state\u2019s interests must then be balanced against the accused\u2019s rights to confront his accusers and to defend himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-10\">{\u00b6 68} The defense purpose for introducing evidence about the prior rape allegation was to cast suspicion on Trent for Davenport\u2019s rape and murder. But <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>no evidence linked the previous rape or Trent with the current charges. Thus, testimony about the earlier rape was not probative and had no bearing on Craig\u2019s defense. Further, Craig\u2019s claims are speculative. The defense argues that police officers would have testified that Trent was under investigation for the earlier rape of Davenport. No evidence was proffered showing that Trent was guilty of that offense. Defense counsel acknowledged that at the time of Davenport\u2019s death no arrests had been made for the earlier rape allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">{\u00b6 69} In <em>Holmes v. South Carolina </em>(2006), 547 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 1727, 164 L.Ed.2d 503, the defendant was convicted of murder based primarily on forensic evidence. At trial, the judge precluded the defendant from introducing evidence that a third party had been in the neighborhood at the time of the murder, and that the third party had either acknowledged the defendant\u2019s innocence or admitted to committing the crimes himself. The state supreme court upheld the trial court\u2019s evidentiary ruling on the ground that \u201c \u2018where there is strong evidence of an appellant\u2019s guilt, especially where there is strong forensic evidence, the proffered evidence about a third party\u2019s alleged guilt does not raise a reasonable inference as to the appellant\u2019s own innocence.\u2019 \u201d 547 U.S. at-, 126 S.Ct. 1727, 1731, 164 L.Ed.2d 503. In reversing the conviction, the Supreme Court held that the rule excluding defense evidence based on the strength of the prosecution\u2019s case was arbitrary and improperly denied the defendant his constitutional right to have \u201c \u2018a meaningful opportunity to present a complete defense.\u2019 \u201d 547 U.S. at-, 126 S.Ct. 1727, 1731, 164 L.Ed.2d 503, quoting <em>Crane v. Kentucky </em>(1986), 476 U.S. 683, 106 S.Ct. 2142, 90 L.Ed.2d 636, quoting <em>California v. Trombetta </em>(1984), 467 U.S. 479, 104 S.Ct. 2528, 81 L.Ed.2d 413.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-10\">{\u00b6 70} In this case, the trial court did not exclude evidence about Trent based on the application of an arbitrary rule. The trial court excluded testimony about the earlier rape only after finding that the evidence was more prejudicial than probative, was inflammatory, and would confuse the jury. The trial court\u2019s ruling was based on well-established rules of evidence, which the <em>Holmes </em>court emphasized could have been properly applied. 547 U.S. at-, 126 S.Ct. 1727, 1731, 164 L.Ed.2d 503. The state\u2019s interests in promoting the rape shield law were not outweighed by speculative evidence of a prior rape that was not connected to Davenport\u2019s murder. We conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by excluding the evidence about the earlier rape allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-12\">{\u00b6 71} Finally, we consider whether Davenport\u2019s death eliminates the underlying purposes of the rape shield law, which includes guarding the victim\u2019s sexual privacy and. protecting her from embarrassment at trial. No part of the rape shield law suggests that a deceased victim\u2019s sexual history is less protected than that of a living victim. See <em>State v. Clowney </em>(1997), 299 N.J.Super. 1, 14, 690 A.2d 612 (\u201cThe statutory goals of protecting the privacy of the victim and seeking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>to avoid character assassination are no less consequential when the rape victim is killed\u201d). See, also, <em>Jenkins v. State </em>(Ind.1993), 627 N.E.2d 789, 795 (\u201cThe goal is to promote the reporting of the crime. If the statute is not applied to victims who ultimately are murdered, then perpetrators of sex crimes will be encouraged to kill their victims, thus enabling them to defend the charges through exploitation of evidence of the victim\u2019s prior sexual activity\u201d). Other jurisdictions have also concluded that the victim\u2019s death does not negate the rape shield law. E.g., <em>State v. Lackey </em>(2005), 280 Kan. 190, 222, 120 P.3d 332; <em>Holland v. State </em>(Miss.1991), 587 So.2d 848, 863. We agree with the majority view and conclude that the state interests underlying the rape shield law are not eliminated when the victim has died.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">{\u00b6 72} We reject proposition of law V.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">{\u00b6 73} <em>Medical examiner\u2019s testimony. </em>In proposition of law VI, Craig argues that the trial court violated his Sixth Amendment right to confront witnesses against him by allowing Dr. Lisa Kohler, the Summit County medical examiner at the time of the trial, to testify about Davenport\u2019s autopsy even though Dr. Roberto Ruiz, Chief Deputy Coroner for Summit County at the time of Davenport\u2019s murder, had conducted the autopsy. Dr. Ruiz retired before Craig\u2019s trial. Before testifying about the autopsy, Dr. Kohler stated that she had reviewed all the materials prepared in connection with Davenport\u2019s autopsy. The defense objected, arguing that Dr. Kohler lacked firsthand knowledge of the autopsy. In overruling this objection, the trial court stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b631-8\">{\u00b6 74} \u201cBy statute, the medical examiner and/or coroner is charged by Ohio law with giving an opinion regarding the manner and method of death in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-9\">{\u00b6 75} \u201cThe court finds that Dr. Kohler has reviewed all of the pertinent aspects of this autopsy and is qualified to render expert opinions regarding this matter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b631-10\">{\u00b6 76} During her testimony, Dr. Kohler described the external and internal examination of Davenport\u2019s body, the multiple injuries that she had suffered, the various tests that the medical examiner\u2019s office had conducted during the autopsy, and the results of those tests. She also identified the numerous photographs taken during the autopsy. Dr. Kohler provided her expert opinion on the cause of death and time of death and testified that Davenport had injuries consistent with vaginal and anal penetration. The trial court admitted the autopsy report into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-11\">{\u00b6 77} \u201cPursuant to Evid.R. 104(A), the trial court determines whether an individual qualifies as an expert, and that determination will be overturned only for an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>State v. Hartman </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 274, 285, 754 N.E.2d 1150. Under Evid.R. 703, \u201cThe facts or data in the particular case upon which an expert bases an opinion or inference may be those perceived by him or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>admitted in evidence at the hearing.\u201d Expert opinions \u201cmay be based on perceptions <em>or </em>facts or data admitted in evidence.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) <em>State v. Solomon </em>(1991), 59 Ohio St.3d 124, 126, 570 N.E.2d 1118. Dr. Kohler\u2019s expert testimony was based in whole or major part on facts and data that she reviewed in the autopsy report. See id., syllabus. That report was admitted into evidence. Dr. Kohler\u2019s expert opinions as to the nature of Davenport\u2019s injuries, the time of her death, and the cause of death were based upon her knowledge and experience, as applied to the facts and data included in the autopsy report. We conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by permitting Dr. Kohler to testify as an expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">{\u00b6 78} Craig argues that Dr. Kohler should not have been allowed to testify because there was no showing that Dr. Ruiz was unavailable to testify. The presentation of expert testimony, however, has no unavailability requirement. See Evid.R. 702. An expert witness can testify even if a more qualified expert might be available. See <em>Ishler v. Miller </em>(1978), 56 Ohio St.2d 447, 10 O.O.3d 539, 384 N.E.2d 296.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">{\u00b6 79} Finally, Dr. Kohler\u2019s expert testimony did not deny Craig his right to confrontation. The jury was fully aware that Dr. Kohler had not personally conducted or been present during Davenport\u2019s autopsy. Moreover, the defense had the opportunity to question Dr. Kohler about the procedures that were performed, the test results, and her expert opinion about the time and cause of death. See <em>State v. Eley </em>(1996), 77 Ohio St.3d 174, 181, 672 N.E.2d 640 (defendant not denied right to confrontation where a coroner who was present at the autopsy but did not conduct the procedure testified about it and its results). See, also, <em>State v. Boyd </em>(May 28, 1992), Cuyahoga App. No. 60639, 1992 WL 114592 (defendant not denied right to confrontation where coroner who did not conduct the autopsy was permitted to testify).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">{\u00b6 80} We also conclude that the autopsy report was admissible. R.C. 313.10 provides that certified records of a coroner are public records and shall be received as evidence in any criminal or civil court. The autopsy report is also admissible as a business record under Evid.R. 803(6). See <em>State v. Bradley </em>(June 15, 1995), Cuyahoga App. Nos. 67430 and 67438, 1995 WL 363816.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-8\">{\u00b6 81} In <em>Crawford v. Washington </em>(2004), 541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177, the Supreme Court held that the Confrontation Clause bars \u201ctestimonial statements of a witness who did not appear at trial unless he was unavailable to testify, and the defendant had had a prior opportunity for cross-examination.\u201d Id. at 53-54, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177. Because <em>Crawford </em>distinguished between testimonial and nontestimonial statements, we must determine whether the autopsy report is testimonial or nontestimonial. Although the court did not provide a comprehensive definition of testimonial statements, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>indicated that business records are, \u201cby their nature,\u201d not testimonial. Id. at 56, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">{\u00b6 82} An autopsy report, prepared by a medical examiner and documenting objective findings, is the \u201cquintessential business record.\u201d <em>Rollins v. State </em>(2005), 161 Md.App. 34, 81, 866 A.2d 926. \u201cThe essence of the business record hearsay exception contemplated in <em>Crawford </em>is that such records or statements are not testimonial in nature because they are prepared in the ordinary course of regularly conducted business and are \u2018by their nature\u2019 not prepared for litigation.\u201d <em>People v. Durio </em>(2005), 7 Misc.3d 729, 734, 794 N.Y.S.2d 863.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">{\u00b6 83} Most jurisdictions that have addressed the issue under <em>Crawford </em>have found that autopsy reports are admissible as nontestimonial business or public records. See <em>Moreno Denoso v. State </em>(Tex.App.2005), 156 S.W.3d 166, 180-182 (autopsy report was not testimonial and was admissible without the deceased pathologist\u2019s testimony); <em>Durio, </em>7 Misc.3d at 734-737, 794 N.Y.S.2d 863 (autopsy report was nontestimonial and its admission without the testimony of the medical examiner who performed the autopsy did not violate Crawford); <em>State v. Cutro </em>(2005), 365 S.C. 366, 378, 618 S.E.2d 890 (autopsy report was nontestimonial).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">{\u00b6 84} Some jurisdictions have resolved the <em>Crawford </em>issue by distinguishing between objective factual findings, which are considered nontestimonial, and opinions and conclusions, which are considered testimonial. See <em>Lackey, </em>280 Kan. at 213-214, 120 P.3d 332; <em>Rollins, </em>161 Md.App. at 82, 866 A.2d 926. In <em>Rollins, </em>a medical examiner who did not perform the autopsy testified about the results of the autopsy. The trial judge redacted those portions of the report that constituted opinions or conclusions, including reference to the cause and manner of death. On appeal, <em>Rollins </em>found that the defendant\u2019s right to confrontation was not violated because the remaining findings in the autopsy report did not constitute testimonial evidence, as contemplated by <em>Crawford. </em>Id. In so holding, <em>Rollins </em>stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b633-9\">{\u00b6 85} \u201c[T]he findings in an autopsy report of the physical condition of a decedent, which are routine, descriptive and not analytical, which are objectively ascertained and generally reliable and enjoy a generic indicium of reliability, may be received into evidence without the testimony of the examiner. Where, however, contested conclusions or opinions in an autopsy report are central to the determination of <em>corpus delecti </em>or criminal agency and are offered into evidence, they serve the same function as testimony and trigger the Sixth Amendment right of confrontation.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-10\">{\u00b6 86} At least one court has found that a defendant\u2019s confrontation rights were violated when the autopsy report was admitted without the testimony of the medical examiner who performed the autopsy, but only under certain circumstances. <em>Smith v. State </em>(Ala.Crim.App.2004), 898 So.2d 907, 915-916. In <em>Smith, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>the court found that the defendant\u2019s confrontation rights were violated because the prosecution was permitted to prove the cause of death, a crucial element of the charge, without providing the defendant with the opportunity to cross-examine the pathologist who originally performed the autopsy. Even so, the court found that <em>Crawford </em>was not implicated because the records were not testimonial and that the violation was harmless error. Id. at 917-918.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">{\u00b6 87} In <em>State v. Delaney </em>(2005), 171 N.C.App. 141, 613 S.E.2d 699, an expert testified that substances found on a defendant\u2019s property were marijuana and opium. The expert\u2019s conclusions were based on analyses conducted by a chemist who did not testify. The court held that the expert\u2019s opinion was admissible. \u201cSince it is well established that an expert may base an opinion on tests performed by others in the field and [that the defendant] was given an opportunity to cross-examine [the expert] on the basis of his opinion, we conclude that there has been no violation of [the defendant\u2019s] right of confrontation under the rationale of <em>Crawford.\u201d </em>Id. at 144, 613 S.E.2d 699.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">{\u00b6 88} We agree with the majority view under <em>Crawford </em>and conclude that autopsy records are admissible as nontestimonial business records. We conclude that Dr. Kohler\u2019s expert testimony about the autopsy findings, the test results, and her opinion about the cause of death did not violate Craig\u2019s confrontation rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">{\u00b6 89} We reject proposition of law VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-8\">{\u00b6 90} <em>Gruesome photographs. </em>In proposition of law VII, Craig argues that the trial court erred in admitting gruesome autopsy and crime-scene photographs of the victim during both phases of the trial. Nonrepetitive photographs, even if gruesome, are admissible in capital cases as long as the probative value of each photograph outweighs the danger of material prejudice to the accused. <em>State v. Morales </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 252, 258, 513 N.E.2d 267; <em>State v. Maurer </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 239, 15 OBR 379, 473 N.E.2d 768, paragraph seven of the syllabus. Decisions on the admissibility of photographs are \u201cleft to the sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d <em>State v. Slagle </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 597, 601, 605 N.E.2d 916.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-9\">{\u00b6 91} Craig complains that the trial court erred in admitting three gruesome crime-scene photographs. State\u2019s exhibit 11 depicts the lower part of Davenport\u2019s clothed body; none of her upper body or head wounds are visible. State\u2019s exhibit 14 shows the injuries to Davenport\u2019s torso and shows that her bra was rolled up above her breast area. State\u2019s exhibit 15 is a close-up of Davenport\u2019s facial area, which shows her head leaning back, her mouth open, and ligature marks around her neck.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-10\">{\u00b6 92} State\u2019s exhibit 11 is not gruesome and supports the state\u2019s theory that Craig allowed Davenport to get dressed after he raped her. State\u2019s exhibits 14 and 15 depicted the wounds inflicted and, although gruesome, were probative of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>Craig\u2019s intent and the manner and circumstances of Davenport\u2019s death. See <em>State v. Jackson, </em>107 Ohio St.3d 53, 2005-Ohio-5981, 836 N.E.2d 1173, \u00b6 85. We conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting these photographs.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">{\u00b6 93} Craig contends that the trial court erred in admitting 16 autopsy photographs. State\u2019s exhibit 59 shows ligature marks around the right side of Davenport\u2019s neck, an abrasion on her nose, and an injury to her upper lip. State\u2019s exhibit 65 shows a ligature mark on the left side of Davenport\u2019s neck. These photographs were probative of the manner of death and Craig\u2019s specific intent to kill. <em>State v. Leonard, </em>104 Ohio St.3d 54, 2004-Ohio-6235, 818 N.E.2d 229, \u00b6 87.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">{\u00b6 94} State\u2019s exhibits 66 and 68 depict two different views of Davenport\u2019s body prior to the autopsy. These full body views show wounds to her neck, face, torso, and leg. State\u2019s exhibit 69 presents a close-up of Davenport\u2019s torso and shows injuries to the back of her hand and her chest. These photos illustrated the medical examiner\u2019s testimony and provided an overall perspective of the victim\u2019s wounds. See <em>Hartman, </em>93 Ohio St.3d at 289, 754 N.E.2d 1150.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">{\u00b6 95} State\u2019s exhibit 75 depicts an abrasion on the victim\u2019s right arm. State\u2019s exhibit 76 is not gruesome and presents a close-up of the same wound. State\u2019s exhibits 82 and 83 depict contusions under the scalp that were observed after the skin was reflected from the skull. These exhibits support the coroner\u2019s testimony about Davenport\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-9\">{\u00b6 96} State\u2019s exhibits 84 and 85 show bruises and lacerations around Davenport\u2019s genital area. State\u2019s exhibits 86 through 90 show bruising and multiple tearing around the victim\u2019s anal opening. Although gruesome, these photographs supported Dr. Kohler\u2019s testimony about vaginal and anal penetration, showed the force involved, and thus helped to prove that Davenport had been anally and vaginally raped.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-10\">{\u00b6 97} We conclude that the trial court could have reasonably found that the substantial probative value of each of the autopsy photographs outweighed any prejudicial impact on the jury. Thus, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting these photographs. <em>State v. Gapen, </em>104 Ohio St.3d 358, 2004-Ohio-6548, 819 N.E.2d 1047, \u00b6 90; <em>State v.

DePew </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 275, 282-283, 528 N.E.2d 542.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-12\">{\u00b6 99} We reject proposition of law VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>{\u00b6 100} <em>Prosecutorial misconduct. </em>In proposition of law VIII, Craig argues that the prosecutor committed prosecutorial misconduct during his penalty-phase closing argument. The test for prosecutorial misconduct in closing arguments is \u201c \u2018whether the remarks were improper and, if so, whether they prejudicially affected substantial rights of the defendant.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Hessler </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 108, 125, 734 N.E.2d 1237, quoting <em>State v. Smith </em>(1984), 14 Ohio St.3d 13, 14, 14 OBR 317, 470 N.E.2d 883. Craig failed to object to the remarks and thus waived all but plain error. <em>State v. Wade </em>(1978), 53 Ohio St.2d 182, 7 O.O.3d 362, 373 N.E.2d 1244, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">{\u00b6 101} Craig claims that the prosecutor improperly argued that testimony about his good family background had no mitigating value. The prosecutor stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">{\u00b6 102} \u201cYou heard, this guy had a fine family. They were supportive. They were emotionally supportive. They were there for him. He was there for them, apparently.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">{\u00b6 103} \u201cHow in any way is that mitigating to what he did to this child? How is that mitigating?</p>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">{\u00b6 104} \u201cThe circumstances you have to consider are the rape, the kidnapping, and the fact that that was done to avoid detection for those crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-9\">{\u00b6 105} \u201cHow in any way is the fact that he was raised in a stable family with a church background mitigating?</p>\n<p id=\"b636-10\">{\u00b6 106} \u201cHow does that lessen his blame?</p>\n<p id=\"b636-11\">{\u00b6 107} \u201cThat actually makes it worse.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-12\">{\u00b6 108} \u201cYou all are sitting there, and maybe have similar upbringings. Maybe had a background that was a supportive family. You were educated. You were given every opportunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-13\">{\u00b6 109} \u201cHe took that ability, he took the common sense that he had, he took the brains that he had, he took everything that his family apparently gave him, including a background in religion, and threw it away to do this. To do this.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b636-14\">{\u00b6 110} The defense presented mitigating evidence that Craig came from a stable home, attended church, and graduated from high school. In response, the prosecutor argued that Craig\u2019s upbringing was entitled to little weight in mitigation because he squandered the advantages he had received. \u201cProsecutors can urge the merits of their cause and legitimately argue that defense mitigation evidence is worthy of little or no weight.\u201d <em>State v. Wilson </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 381, 399, 659 N.E.2d 292. Moreover, \u201ccounsel for both parties are afforded wide latitude during closing argument.\u201d <em>State v. Brown </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 305, 317, 528 N.E.2d 523. The prosecutor did not commit plain error, or any error, in making this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>{\u00b6 111} Craig also claims that the prosecutor improperly appealed to the fears and passions of the jury when the prosecutor stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">{\u00b6 112} \u201cThe legislature allowed these particular specifications to exist so that the death penalty would be appropriate, so that the death penalty would be considered, just as you are doing now.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">{\u00b6 113} \u201cAnd it was done because children should be able to walk the streets. Children shouldn\u2019t be murdered after being raped and after being kidnapped. And that\u2019s why the legislature has allowed this penalty for this type of crime.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b637-8\">{\u00b6 114} The prosecutor\u2019s rebuttal argument responded to issues raised during the defense\u2019s closing argument and to defense claims that the death penalty is uncivilized. Counsel for the defense had asked, \u201c[H]ow can we expect our children to respect the sanctity of human life if we are teaching our youngsters that it is okay to kill other human beings because they killed somebody[?]\u201d The prosecutor\u2019s remarks regarding the aggravating circumstances represented fair comment. See <em>State v. Bryan, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 272, 2004-Ohio-971, 804 N.E.2d 433, \u00b6 183 (prosecutor\u2019s argument that shooting a police officer was an aggravating circumstance to \u201cpreserve the public tranquility\u201d was fair comment). We conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s rebuttal argument was not plain error. See <em>State v. Lynch, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 514, 2003-Ohio-2284, 787 N.E.2d 1185, \u00b6 76.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-9\">{\u00b6 115} We reject proposition of law VIII.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-10\">{\u00b6 116} <em>Merger. </em>In proposition of law IX, Craig argues that the trial court erred when it refused to merge the kidnapping and rape specifications or the rape and kidnapping offenses. Craig contends that <em>State v. Logan </em>(1979), 60 Ohio St.2d 126, 14 O.O.3d 373, 397 N.E.2d 1345, requires the offenses and specifications to be merged because they were committed with a single animus.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-11\">{\u00b6 117} Before sentencing, the defense requested that the rape and kidnapping charges be merged into the aggravated murder charge. The trial court rejected the request, stating that \u201cthe kidnapping was not merely incidental to the rapes, but significantly independent of them.\u201d The test for determining whether kidnapping and rape were committed with a separate animus as to each is \u201cwhether the restraint or movement of the victim is merely incidental to a \u25a0separate underlying crime or, instead, whether it has a significance independent of the other offense.\u201d Id. at 135, 14 O.O.3d 373, 397 N.E.2d 1345. \u2018Where the asportation or restraint of the victim subjects the victim to a substantial increase in risk of harm separate and apart from that involved in the underlying crime, there exists a separate animus as to each offense sufficient to support separate convictions.\u201d Id. at subparagraph (b) of the syllabus. In <em>Logan </em>and in subsequent cases, we have said that prolonged restraint, secretive confinement, or substantial movement of the victim apart from that involved in the other crime were factors establishing a separate animus for kidnapping. Id. at subparagraph <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>(a) of the syllabus; <em>State v. Foust, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 137, 2004-Ohio-7006, 823 N.E.2d 836, \u00b6 141; <em>Lynch, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 514, 2003-Ohio-2284, 787 N.E.2d 1185, \u00b6 134.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">{\u00b6 118} On the evening of February 28,1996, Craig abducted Davenport as she was walking home. He then took her to the empty apartment on Maple Street or some other location where he raped her. The evidence shows that Davenport was orally, anally, and vaginally raped, and then apparently allowed to dress. Only then did Craig murder her. See <em>State v. Hill </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 313, 332, 595 N.E.2d 884 (separate animus for kidnapping where defendant forced a 12-year-old victim from a parking lot to a wooded area where he then raped and murdered him); <em>State v. Powell </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 255, 261-262, 552 N.E.2d 191 (kidnapping upheld as a separate offense where defendant lured a child from her home to a nearby building where he attempted to rape her and then killed her); cf. <em>State v. Adams, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 508, 2004-Ohio-5845, 817 N.E.2d 29, \u00b6 93 (no separate animus since victim not moved from the bedroom where she was raped and murdered). We conclude that the evidence established that a separate animus existed for the kidnapping separate and apart from the rapes.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">{\u00b6 119} We reject proposition of law IX.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">{\u00b6 120} <em>Sentencing for rape and kidnapping. </em>In proposition of law X, Craig argues that the trial court improperly sentenced him for the rape and kidnapping offenses based upon provisions of law that were not in effect at the time these offenses were committed. Am.Sub.S.B. No. 2, 146 Ohio Laws, Part IV, 7136 (\u201cSenate Bill 2\u201d), became effective on July 1, 1996. This comprehensive bill changed the sentencing system in Ohio by providing precise guidance for criminal sentencing. See <em>State v. Comer, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 463, 2003-Ohio-4165, 793 N.E.2d 473, \u00b6 10. But, see, <em>State v. Foster, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 1, 2006-Ohio-856, 845 N.E.2d 470, paragraphs one, three, and five of the syllabus (portions of Senate Bill 2 are unconstitutional). The General Assembly also enacted Am.Sub.S.B. No. 269, 146 Ohio Laws, Part VII, 10752, 11099, which clarified that Senate Bill 2 applies only to the sentences of individuals who commit an offense on or after July 1, 1996. See <em>State v. Madrigal </em>(2000), 87 Ohio St.3d 378, 399, 721 N.E.2d 52 (sentencing provisions of Senate Bill 2 apply only to crimes committed on or after July 1, 1996); <em>State ex rel. Maynard v. Corrigan </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 332, 333, 691 N.E.2d 280.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-8\">{\u00b6 121} Craig argues that because his offenses were committed in February and March 1996, he was improperly sentenced for the rape and kidnapping offenses under provisions of law that were effective only after July 1, 1996. The trial court sentenced Craig on the basis of R.C. 2929.11(A), 2929.14(A), (B), (C), and (E), and 2929.19(B)(2)(c) and (e). These provisions were not in effect until after July 1, 1996, and therefore do not apply to offenses committed before that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>date. The trial court\u2019s entry shows that Craig was sentenced for the rape and kidnapping offenses based on the provisions of the Ohio Revised Code that became effective after July 1,1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">{\u00b6 122} We conclude that Craig was improperly sentenced for the kidnapping and rape offenses. Accordingly, proposition of law X has merit. We remand the cause to the trial court so that Craig can be resentenced for the rape and kidnapping offenses under the law in effect at the time the offenses were committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">{\u00b6 123} <em>Sentence appropriateness. </em>In proposition of law XI, Craig argues that his death sentence is inappropriate because the aggravating circumstances do not outweigh the mitigating factors. We will discuss this argument during our independent sentence evaluation. As that discussion will explain, we reject proposition of law XI.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-8\">{\u00b6 124} <em>Proportionality. </em>In proposition of law XII, Craig challenges the constitutionality of Ohio\u2019s death-penalty proportionality review. This argument has been repeatedly rejected by a majority of this court. See, e.g., <em>State v. LaMar, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 181, 2002-Ohio-2128, 767 N.E.2d 166, \u00b6 23; <em>State v. Steffen </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 111, 31 OBR 273, 509 N.E.2d 383, paragraph one of the syllabus. But, see, <em>State v. Issa </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 49, 75, 752 N.E.2d 904 (Pfeifer, J., dissenting); <em>State v. Murphy </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 516, 562, 747 N.E.2d 765 (Pfeifer, J., dissenting). We reject proposition of law XII.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-9\">{\u00b6 125} <em>Constitutionality. </em>In proposition of law XIII, Craig challenges the constitutionality of Ohio\u2019s death-penalty statutes under both the United States Constitution and the Ohio Constitution. We summarily reject this challenge. See <em>State v. Carter </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 593, 607, 734 N.E.2d 345; <em>State v. Clemons </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 438, 454, 696 N.E.2d 1009; <em>State v. Jenkins </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 164, 15 OBR 311, 473 N.E.2d 264, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-10\">{\u00b6 126} Craig also disputes the constitutionality of lethal injection as a means to carry out the death penalty. We reject this claim. See <em>Adams, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 508, 2004-Ohio-5845, 817 N.E.2d 29, \u00b6 131; <em>Carter, </em>89 Ohio St.3d at 608, 734 N.E.2d 345.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-11\">{\u00b6 127} Craig contends that Ohio\u2019s death-penalty statutes violate international law and treaties to which the United States is a party. These arguments also lack merit. <em>Issa, </em>93 Ohio St.3d at 69, 752 N.E.2d 904; <em>State v. Phillips </em>(1995), 74 Ohio St.3d 72, 656 N.E.2d 643.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-12\">{\u00b6 128} We reject proposition of law XIII.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-13\">{\u00b6 129} <em>Independent sentence evaluation. </em>The evidence established beyond a reasonable doubt that Craig murdered Roseanna Davenport while committing or attempting to commit rape and kidnapping, R.C. 2929.04(A)(7), and that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>murdered her for the purpose of escaping detection, apprehension, trial, or punishment, R.C. 2929.04(A)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">{\u00b6 130} Craig called eight mitigation witnesses during the penalty phase.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">{\u00b6 131} Charles Jones married Carolyn Jones, Craig\u2019s mother, when Craig was about 14 years old. Charles was actively involved in raising Craig and his four brothers. Charles described Craig as a \u201cvery soft-hearted, malleable young man,\u201d who attended church and Sunday school. Craig behaved very well towards Charles and his mother and helped around the house. Craig helped look after Charles\u2019s grandmother, who lived with the family after she became an amputee. Charles testified that Craig would \u201ctalk with her, spend time with her. And whatever she needed, he would get for her.\u201d Charles stated that he and Carolyn provided Craig with a stable environment. Illegal drugs were never allowed in their home, and Charles never saw any indication that Craig was using drugs while he lived at home.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">{\u00b6 132} Carolyn Jones, Craig\u2019s mother, testified that she and Charles have been married for 29 years. She had lived in the same Akron home since 1971. Craig attended Akron public schools and graduated from South High School, where he received average grades. Craig was actively involved in church activities while growing up and was a junior deacon. While a teenager, Craig helped elderly people living in the neighborhood by mowing their grass, cleaning their garages, and shoveling snow. Craig also performed household chores around the house and had a summer job working on a farm.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">{\u00b6 133} Ray Craig, Craig\u2019s younger brother, had a good relationship with Craig. Ray and Craig gardened, fished, played sports, and were involved in church activities together. During summers while growing up, Craig and his brothers would visit their grandfather in Birmingham, Alabama. While in high school, Craig was a tennis player and played the tuba and drums in the band. Ray and Craig remained close in adulthood and took trips, went to family reunions, and did a lot of activities together. Ray did not have any contact with his brother during the seven years that Craig was in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-8\">{\u00b6 134} Troy Craig, Craig\u2019s youngest brother, testified that he had a \u201cvery close\u201d relationship with all of his brothers. Troy testified that the brothers were involved in church activities and even helped to repair and remodel their church. While growing up, Craig would often bring home stray dogs and cats and take care of them. As an adult, Troy maintained regular contact with Craig until Troy moved to Atlanta, Georgia, in 1989. Even then, Troy and Craig regularly talked to each other on the phone.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-9\">{\u00b6 135} Lisa Griffin, Craig\u2019s sister, was 16 when she learned that she and the Craig brothers had the same father. Since learning about their relationship, Craig and Griffin have been close. Craig took Griffin to the doctor after she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>broke her leg, he took her to the grocery store because she did not have a car, and he helped pay her bills when she was having problems. Craig also tried to teach Griffin how to cook, iron clothes, and fix a car.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">{\u00b6 136} Joseph Dubina, regional administrator for the Adult Parole Authority, testified that a sentence of life in prison without parole eligibility for 20 years, or a sentence of life in prison without parole eligibility for 30 years, would require Craig to spend 20 or 30 full years in prison before he could be considered for parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">{\u00b6 137} Jason LaRouche, who had worked as a correctional program specialist with the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction, conducted security reviews and had quarterly contacts with Craig when he was an inmate at the Belmont Correctional Facility. According to LaRouche, assignment to the Belmont Correctional Camp was an indication of Craig\u2019s \u201cbetter than average\u201d ability to adjust to institutional life. LaRouche does not remember Craig having any disciplinary problems. Craig worked in the food service department. His inmate evaluation reports in 2000, 2001, and 2002 rated him an excellent worker. A May 24, 2003 report rated Craig as a good worker, and the reviewer of the report said that Craig was an \u201cacceptable worker.\u201d Craig disagreed with that evaluation and refused to sign it.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">{\u00b6 138} Dr. Joseph Bendo, a psychologist, reviewed Craig\u2019s school, military, and prison records. Craig graduated from high school with an overall grade point average of 1.1. He served approximately eight years in the Army. He was court-martialed three times and received a dishonorable discharge. His court-martial offenses included an absence without leave for a year and one-half, assault, and theft. Craig had also been in prison for seven or eight years at the Belmont Correctional Facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-8\">{\u00b6 139} Results from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale showed that Craig has a full-scale IQ of 83. Dr. Bendo testified that Craig had impaired cognitive functioning, as demonstrated by his low IQ and his low grade-point average in high school. Craig\u2019s history of substance abuse, especially alcohol abuse, also contributed to his impaired cognitive functioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-9\">{\u00b6 140} Craig experienced \u201ctrauma or early loss\u201d while growing up. His sister died when she was two months old, and one of his brothers died from a brain tumor. Craig also reported that he experienced racial pressure, especially in junior high school. Craig has \u201cemotional deficits\u201d as shown by the lack of significant bonding with people outside his immediate family. Craig reported that he had \u201cno close friends\u201d and that he had no visitors when he was in jail. He had a history of broken relationships and a failed marriage and lacked a significant relationship with his child.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>{\u00b6 141} Craig had a strict upbringing. According to Dr. Bendo, \u201c[t]here seemed to be a formality or distance in the early years, and as an adult, there was very little, if any, emotional support offered.\u201d Craig also has problems with \u201cimpulse and anger control,\u201d and it was difficult for him to admit fault or shortcomings.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">{\u00b6 142} Review of Craig\u2019s prison records shows that he adapted well to prison when incarcerated from 1996 to 2003. Craig received evaluations identifying his ability to \u201cget along with others, help other people, and do a good job.\u201d Craig\u2019s prison records showed no indication of violent outbursts. Dr. Bendo concluded that Craig made a \u201cvery good adjustment\u201d to prison life and \u201cwent out of his way to improve his situation in jail.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">{\u00b6 143} Dr. Bendo testified that the general life expectancy for a black male in the United States is 68.6 years. Dr. Bendo also stated that one study showed that a sentence of 20 years in prison will take 16 years off a life expectancy. Dr. Bendo believes that there is a \u201cvery, very low probability\u201d that Craig would be a threat to anyone if he was incarcerated for 30 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">{\u00b6 144} <em>Sentence evaluation. </em>The jury convicted Craig of three death-penalty specifications: under R.C. 2929.04(A)(7), murder while committing, attempting to commit, or fleeing after committing rape; under R.C. 2929.04(A)(7), murder while committing, attempting to commit, or fleeing after committing kidnapping; and under R.C. 2929.04(A)(3), murder for the purpose of escaping detection or apprehension for rape or kidnapping. Upon independent assessment, we hold that the evidence establishes beyond a reasonable doubt each of the aggravating circumstances charged against Craig.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">{\u00b6 145} Nothing in the nature and circumstances of the offenses is mitigating. Craig abducted 12-year-old Roseanna Davenport as she was walking home. He subsequently raped and murdered her. The facts establish a horrific crime that lacks any mitigating features. Craig\u2019s character also offers no mitigation. His history and background provide little mitigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-9\">{\u00b6 146} The statutory mitigating factors are generally inapplicable. See R.C. 2929.04(B)(1) (victim inducement), (B)(2) (duress, coercion, or strong provocation), (B)(3) (mental disease or defect), (B)(4) (youth of the offender), (B)(5) (lack of a significant criminal history), and (B)(6) (accomplice only). The catchall provision, R.C. 2929.04(B)(7), has some limited applicability. We give some weight to the love and support that Craig shares with his family. See <em>State v. Myers, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 335, 2002-Ohio-6658, 780 N.E.2d 186, \u00b6 178. We give considerable weight to Craig\u2019s below-average intelligence (IQ of 83). His history of substance abuse is also entitled to some weight. <em>State v. Landrum </em>(1990), 53 Ohio St.3d 107, 125, 559 N.E.2d 710. Finally, we give weight to testimony that Craig will adapt well to life in prison. <em>State v. Hand, </em>107 Ohio St.3d 378, 2006-Ohio-18, 840 N.E.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>151, \u00b6 281; <em>Madrigal, </em>87 Ohio St.3d at 397, 721 N.E.2d 52. Craig\u2019s military-service is entitled to no weight because he was dishonorably discharged. The evidence does not indicate that there are any other mitigating factors under R.C. 2929.04(B)(7).</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b643-11\">Sherri Bevan Walsh, Summit County Prosecuting Attorney, and Richard S. Kasay, Assistant Prosecuting Attorney, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b643-12\">Nathan A. Ray and George C. Pappas Jr., for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">{\u00b6 147} After weighing each aggravating circumstance against the mitigating factors, we conclude that each aggravating circumstance outweighs the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt. Thus, we hold that the death penalty is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">{\u00b6 148} We conclude that the sentence of death is proportionate to death sentences approved in other rape-murder cases. See <em>Foust, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 137, 2004-Ohio-7006, 823 N.E.2d 836, \u00b6 204; <em>Lynch, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 514, 2003-Ohio-2284, 787 N.E.2d ll85, \u00b6 196; <em>State v. Phillips </em>(1995), 74 Ohio St.3d 72, 106, 656 N.E.2d 643. The death sentence is also proportionate to death sentences approved for other kidnapping-murder cases. See <em>State v. Monroe, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 384, 2005-Ohio-2282, 827 N.E.2d 285, \u00b6 120. The death sentence is also proportionate to death sentences approved for other murders to avoid detection, apprehension, trial, or punishment. <em>Hand, </em>107 Ohio St.3d 378, 2006-Ohio-18, 840 N.E.2d 151, \u00b6 284; <em>Wilson, </em>74 Ohio St.3d at 400-401, 659 N.E.2d 292.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-8\">{\u00b6 149} We affirm Craig\u2019s convictions. We vacate the sentences for rape and kidnapping and remand the cause to the trial court for resentencing on counts two, three, and four (rapes), and count five (kidnapping). Those sentences should be based on the law that was in effect at the time the noncapital offenses were committed. We affirm the sentence of death for the murder conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-9\">Judgment affirmed in part and vacated in part, and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b643-10\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell and Lanzinger, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
