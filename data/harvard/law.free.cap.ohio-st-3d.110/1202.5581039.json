Lantz and her client Gregory S. Camburn have filed affidavits with the clerk of this court under R.C. 2701.03 seeking the disqualification of Judge Carole Squire from acting on any further proceedings in case Nos. 05DV-01-051 and 05DR-01-124 in the Court of Common Pleas of Franklin County, Domestic Relations Division. Lantz also asks that Judge Squire be disqualified from any cases in which Lantz is now serving as counsel of record.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-8\">{\u00b6 2} First, the timeliness of the affidavit merits discussion. R.C. 2701.03(B) requires that an affidavit of disqualification be filed \u201cnot less than seven calendar days before the day on which the next hearing\u201d in the case is scheduled. Compliance with that deadline can be excused only when the affiant has demonstrated that the affidavit \u201ccould not have been filed on time.\u201d <em>In re Disqualification of Badger </em>(1989), 43 Ohio St.3d 601, 538 N.E.2d 1023.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-9\">{\u00b6 3} The affidavits in this case were filed with the clerk of this court on February 7, 2005. The next scheduled hearing before Judge Squire was then set for February 10, 2005. Though the affidavits were filed less than seven days before the next hearing, Lantz explains that several of the events giving rise to the allegations in the affidavits occurred just three or four days before the affidavits were filed. Also, Judge Squire did not schedule the February 10, 2005 hearing until February 4, 2005. In light of these facts, I conclude that the clerk properly accepted the affidavits for filing despite the seven-day requirement in R.C. 2701.03(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b825-10\">{\u00b6 4} The two affiants describe a series of unpleasant courtroom encounters between attorney Lantz and Judge Squire. According to Lantz, the judge has repeatedly shown an unwillingness to listen to Lantz\u2019s arguments, has demanded additional information before issuing emergency orders but then has not made herself available once the information was gathered, has shown a general lack of patience and courtesy, has refused to allow a court reporter to keep an official record of proceedings in the courtroom, and has allowed her bailiff to treat Lantz in a discourteous and dismissive way. The judge has shown several flashes of anger toward Lantz in the courtroom, the affidavits explain, and has held Lantz in contempt for allegedly ignoring instructions given to her by the bailiff and for failing to bring the parties\u2019 children to the courthouse even though any instructions or orders on those matters were not journalized or recorded. The judge, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1204\">*1204</page-number>according to the affidavits, also directed Lantz\u2019s client to secure new counsel within 35 minutes, but refused to allow discussion about that ruling on the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">{\u00b6 5} Judge Squire has responded to the affidavits in writing, and has offered several affidavits of her own as well. The judge contends that she has acted at all times in the best interests of the parties\u2019 children, and states that she holds no ill will or bias against any of the parties or their lawyers. Supporting statements from the parents of party Maria Camburn and her daughter allege that attorney Lantz interrupted the judge, argued with her, and behaved rudely in the courtroom. The judge\u2019s bailiff has also supplied an affidavit in which she states that attorney Lantz ignored her instructions and was rude and disruptive before the judge herself.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-6\">{\u00b6 6} In a case such as this, where persons who saw the same events disagree so sharply about what happened, I cannot hope to sort out all of their factual disputes, let alone resolve the lingering mistrust that some or all of them may now feel. What I can and must do in a case like this, however, is determine whether the judge in question can fairly and impartially preside over future proceedings, despite the disagreement that occurred between the judge and an attorney for one of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-7\">{\u00b6 7} In the end, I conclude that disqualification of the judge is appropriate in this case to ensure the parties and the public that the underlying legal issues before the trial court will be resolved dispassionately and fairly and to make certain that the outcome of the case will not be affected by the sharp differences that have divided and continue to divide the judge and attorney Lantz.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-8\">{\u00b6 8} A judge, \u201cnotwithstanding the conduct of litigants or counsel, has an ethical obligation to conduct himself or herself in a courteous and dignified manner that does not convey the appearance of bias or prejudice toward litigants or their attorneys.\u201d <em>In re Disqualification of Cleary </em>(2000), 88 Ohio St.3d 1220, 1222-1223, 723 N.E.2d 1106. See, also, Canon 3(B)(4) of the Code of Judicial Conduct (directing judges to be \u201cpatient, dignified, and courteous\u201d to parties and their lawyers, even in the most difficult of circumstances). A judge must not let his or her views about or frustrations with an attorney so infect the case that a disinterested observer might reasonably question the judge\u2019s ability to evaluate fairly and objectively both the attorney\u2019s future work and the parties\u2019 legal interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-9\">{\u00b6 9} The information presented to me in the various affidavits suggests that Judge Squire was quick to anger in the courtroom and exchanged sharp words with attorney Lantz on multiple days. The judge moved with considerable speed to hold Lantz in contempt and resisted Lantz\u2019s requests to create a complete stenographic record of the full series of events that occurred in the courtroom. The judge described Lantz\u2019s behavior on the record as \u201cdiscourteous, disrespect<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1205\">*1205</page-number>ful, unprofessional, [and] oppositional,\u201d and said that she had interfered \u201cwith the effective and efficient administration of justice.\u201d Lantz in turn has alleged that the judge \u201cintentionally and actively attempted] to interfere\u201d with the attorney-client relationship between Lantz and her client Gregory Camburn. The working relationship between the judge and attorney Lantz appears, in short, to have devolved into a shouting match, first in the courtroom and now in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-4\">{\u00b6 10} The unfortunate series of heated courtroom discussions described by the judge and affiants on both sides now poses an impediment to the judge\u2019s ability to resolve any remaining legal and factual issues in a way that will appear to the parties and the public to be objective and fair. \u201cIt is of vital importance that the litigant should believe that he will have a fair trial,\u201d <em>State ex rel. Turner v. Marshall </em>(1931), 123 Ohio St. 586, 587, 176 N.E. 454, and in this case, it seems fair to say that attorney Lantz and her client no longer hold that belief. An objective observer who has read the transcripts provided to me and the judge\u2019s and Lantz\u2019s characterizations of their courtroom discussions might reasonably question whether either of them can now set aside her seemingly fixed views of the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">{\u00b6 11} In recognition of the unique standards of professionalism required of judges, this court adopted a \u201cJudicial Creed\u201d in 2001 on the recommendation of the Supreme Court Commission on Professionalism. By doing so, the court sought to remind every judge of the high standards expected of them by the public they serve. Three provisions of that creed bear repeating here:</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cI know that I must not only be fair but also give the appearance of being fair.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-7\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cI recognize that the dignity of my office requires the highest level of judicial demeanor.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-8\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cI will treat all persons, including litigants, lawyers, witnesses, jurors, judicial colleagues, and court staff with dignity and courtesy and will insist that others do likewise.\u201d A Judicial Creed, Appendix Y to the Ohio Rules for the Government of the Bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-9\">{\u00b6 15} I hope that Judge Squire and other Ohio judges will continue to work toward the aspirational standards described in the Judicial Creed. In the meantime, however, I conclude that Judge Squire must be disqualified from further proceedings in the two cases listed in the caption above because a reasonable and objective observer familiar with proceedings described in attorney Lantz\u2019s affidavit and the judge\u2019s response might reasonably question the judge\u2019s ability to preside fairly and impartially in these cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-10\">{\u00b6 16} Even so, I decline to order that Judge Squire be removed from all of attorney Lantz\u2019s pending cases. I remain hopeful that the two of them can move <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1206\">*1206</page-number>beyond the lingering mutual suspicion that seems to have marked their professional relationship in recent months. Both of them would do well to recall the words of the Lawyer\u2019s Creed adopted by this court eight years ago:</p>\n<p id=\"b828-4\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cTo my colleagues in the practice of law, I offer concern for your reputation and well-being. I shall extend to you the same courtesy, respect, candor, and dignity that I expect to be extended to me.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">{\u00b6 18} \u201c* * * I recognize that my actions and demeanor reflect upon our system of justice and our profession, and I shall conduct myself accordingly.\u201d A Lawyer\u2019s Creed, Appendix V to the Ohio Rules for the Government of the Bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-6\">{\u00b6 19} The cases listed in the caption above are returned to the administrative judge of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas, Domestic Relations Division, for reassignment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
