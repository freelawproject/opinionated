Miller v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1994), 71 Ohio St.3d 229, 643 N.E.2d 113, require the Industrial Commission of Ohio to consider the employer\u2019s facility-related costs in determining whether a claimant may receive treatment at another physical-therapy facility recommended by his doctor? For the reasons to follow, we hold that <em>Miller </em>does not contain this requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-9\">{\u00b6 2} Appellee Thomas Clifford has an allowed workers\u2019 compensation claim for \u201cright shoulder strain[,] * * * tear of right rotator cuff * * * and biceps tendon tear, right shoulder.\u201d Clifford eventually required shoulder surgery and received follow-up physical therapy at Springfield Physical Therapy as requested by his attending physician, Dr. Paul Nitz. Appellant-employer, self-insured Navistar International Transportation Corporation, approved the request on the condition that Clifford receive his physical therapy at Navistar\u2019s on-site medical facility. Because Clifford would not agree to physical therapy at Navistar\u2019s facility, Navistar denied treatment authorization.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-10\">{\u00b6 3} The dispute moved to the appellee Industrial Commission. After protracted hearings, the commission found that \u201cthis decision simply comes down to an interpretation of the test enunciated in the case of <em>State ex rel. Miller v. Indus. Comm.\u201d </em>It reviewed <em>Miller\u2019s </em>three-pronged test for authorization of medical services: (1) Are the services reasonably related to the allowed condition? (2) Are the services reasonably necessary for treatment of the allowed condition? (3) Is the cost of the service \u201cmedically reasonable\u201d? Id. at 232, 643 N.E.2d 113. After answering each question in the affirmative, the commission authorized therapy with Springfield Physical Therapy.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-11\">{\u00b6 4} Navistar filed a complaint in mandamus in the Court of Appeals for Franklin County, alleging that the commission abused its discretion in authorizing treatment at the Springfield facility. Navistar argued that if physical therapy is authorized at a facility other than its own, it will \u201cpay twice\u201d \u2014 i.e., once for the cost of the off-site facility and again for the expense of its own facility. It argued that because of the commission\u2019s failure to address that consideration, its analysis is deficient. The court of appeals was not persuaded, holding that the commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>sion\u2019s analysis was appropriate under <em>Miller </em>and the conclusion was supported by evidence. The writ was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\">{\u00b6 5} The cause is now before this court on an appeal as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">{\u00b6 6} We begin by clarifying that the issue in this case is <em>not </em>about a claimant\u2019s free choice of doctors. Contrary to Navistar\u2019s representation, neither the commission nor the court below ruled \u2014 directly or inferentially \u2014 that Clifford\u2019s physical-therapy request for treatment with Springfield Physical Therapy was granted because Clifford had an unfettered right to treatment anywhere and anytime. The commission granted \u2014 and the court of appeals upheld \u2014 the motion because Clifford\u2019s request satisfied the three-prong test in <em>Miller.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">{\u00b6 7} The parties agree that Clifford\u2019s request satisfies the first two prongs delineated in <em>Miller, </em>and they focus solely on the third prong: whether, under the circumstances, the costs that Navistar has been ordered to assume are \u201cmedically reasonable.\u201d Navistar concedes that Clifford\u2019s request of physical therapy from the Springfield Physical Therapy group, \u201cwhen considered in a vacuum,\u201d is medically reasonable. Navistar proposes, however, that the cost of the services cannot be viewed in a vacuum and that the commission must balance the proposed costs against the employer\u2019s own facility-related costs. In other words, the commission must consider the fact that if Clifford\u2019s request is granted as submitted, Navistar will effectively incur double the cost because it has already incurred the cost of creating its own facility and will now have to assume the cost for treatment at Springfield Physical Therapy as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">{\u00b6 8} <em>Miller </em>does not contain the requirement advocated by Navistar. Accordingly, the commission did not abuse its discretion in failing to consider Navistar\u2019s facility-related costs. Regarding the question of evidentiary support for the commission\u2019s determination that <em>Miller </em>was satisfied, Dr. Nitz\u2019s C-9 motion for authorization of physical therapy at Springfield Physical Therapy supported the commission\u2019s decision. Although it is admirable that Navistar has voluntarily created its own facility to provide physical-therapy treatment to injured employees, it may not condition treatment authorization on an employee\u2019s agreement to use its facility rather than any other.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-8\">{\u00b6 9} The judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b473-10\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, Pfeifer, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell and Lanzinger, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b473-11\">Lundberg Stratton, J., concurs separately.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b473-12\">Lundberg Stratton, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ALD\">concurring.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b474-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>Vorys, Sater, Seymour &amp; Pease, L.L.P., Joseph A.

It seems to be a sound policy to encourage companies to establish on-site physical-therapy facilities for both the convenience of the employees and for cost savings to the employers and the workers\u2019 compensation system. But this court does not set Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation policy. Navistar\u2019s issues are more appropriately directed to the legislature. Current law simply applies three tests, which the claimant satisfied. Therefore, I concur in the decision of this court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
