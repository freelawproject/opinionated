Timothy Franczak pursued on foot a man who had rapidly exited the driver\u2019s side of the car and escaped through a nearby fence. The sergeant later described the man as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1231\">*1231</page-number>short, stocky black male between the ages of 18 and 20 and, despite having been a distance of 25 to 35 feet away from the man, stated that he clearly viewed the man\u2019s face as the man had turned to escape through the fence. During an inventory of the car, Sgt. Franczak found a cellular telephone and subsequently answered it when it rang. The caller asked for \u201cMaurice\u201d before hanging up.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">{\u00b6 5} The sergeant then searched the vehicle\u2019s ownership information through the Law Enforcement Automated Data System (\u201cLEADS\u201d) database and called the owner of the car. The owner told him that \u201cMaurice\u201d had had possession of her car for the past two days and gave to the sergeant \u201cMaurice\u2019s\u201d full name, address, and date of birth. Sgt. Franczak immediately entered that information into the LEADS database and obtained Maurice Bates\u2019s Bureau of Motor Vehicles photograph. Sgt. Franczak testified that his initial reaction to the photograph was \u201cThat\u2019s the guy,\u201d meaning that Bates was the man that he had chased that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">{\u00b6 6} When Bates voluntarily appeared at the police station five days later, the sergeant again indicated that Bates\u2019s physical appearance merely confirmed what he already knew: that Bates was the individual who had run from him following the chase. Based upon the department\u2019s policy to seek direct indictment unless the crime involved a gun or violence, however, Sgt. Franczak did not immediately arrest Bates. After the sergeant read Bates his <em>Miranda </em>rights, Bates told the sergeant that another man had actually been involved in the crime. The sergeant then investigated the other individual and determined almost immediately that the other man bore no resemblance to the man that the sergeant had seen escaping through the fence.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-7\">{\u00b6 7} At trial, the court allowed testimony concerning the eyewitness identification by Sgt. Franczak, along with other evidence. Bates was convicted. The appellate court reversed Bates\u2019s convictions and remanded for a new trial based entirely on its holding that the identification testimony offered by Sgt. Franczak had violated Bates\u2019s due process rights because the testimony was based on an impermissibly suggestive identification process.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-8\">{\u00b6 8} The admission of impermissibly suggestive identification evidence obtained by unnecessary measures violates a defendant\u2019s constitutional due process rights in cases where the totality of the circumstances does not support the reliability of the identification. See <em>Manson v. Brathwaite </em>(1977), 432 U.S. 98, 97 S.Ct. 2243, 53 L.Ed.2d 140. Courts generally find the use of a single photograph for identification purposes impermissibly suggestive absent extraordinary circumstances. See <em>Stovall v. Denno </em>(1967), 388 U.S. 293, 87 S.Ct. 1967, 18 L.Ed.2d 1199. Even assuming that the procedure used in this case was suggestive,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1232\">*1232</page-number>suggestive nature of the identification goes only to the weight of the evidence, not to its admissibility. <em>State v. Jells </em>(1990), 53 Ohio St.3d 22, 26-27, 559 N.E.2d 464; <em>Manson v. Bmthwaite, </em>432 U.S. at 114, 97 S.Ct. 2243, 53 L.Ed.2d 140.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-4\">{\u00b6 9} A court determines admissibility of identification testimony by considering whether the totality of the circumstances indicates reliability despite the suggestive nature of the photographic identification. <em>Jells, </em>53 Ohio St.3d at 27, 559 N.E.2d 464. Five factors establish reliability: (1) the opportunity of the witness to view the defendant at the time of the crime, (2) the witness\u2019s degree of attention, (3) the accuracy of any prior description of the defendant given by the witness, (4) the level of certainty demonstrated by the witness as to the identification, and (5) the length of time between the crime and the identification. <em>Neil v. Biggers </em>(1972), 409 U.S. 188, 199-200, 93 S.Ct. 375, 34 L.Ed.2d 401.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">{\u00b6 10} The record reflects that Sgt. Franczak had only a brief view of the perpetrator as he ran through a fence before subsequently discovering the single LEADS photograph of Bates through his investigation of circumstantial evidence. The appellate court first considered whether the identification procedure utilized in this case was impermissibly suggestive. In deciding that issue, however, the appellate court improperly considered the <em>reliability </em>factors instead of analyzing the actual identification procedure. While the appellate court may have determined correctly that the use of a single LEADS photograph for identification purposes was impermissibly suggestive, the court engaged in improper analysis to reach that conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">{\u00b6 11} The appellate court next decided that the sergeant\u2019s out-of-court and in-court identification testimony was unreliable. It relied heavily upon four factors: (1) the sergeant\u2019s limited time to view the perpetrator, (2) his failure to immediately arrest Bates when Bates voluntarily appeared at the police station for questioning, (3) the failure of the sergeant to state that Bates\u2019s twin brother resembled him in any way, and (4) the availability of a less suggestive and more reliable method of identification. Only the first factor has any relevance to the five-pronged reliability analysis. The appellate court\u2019s reliance on the remaining factors and its analysis do nothing to address the actual issue before it: whether, in the totality of the circumstances, the identification was sufficiently reliable.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-7\">{\u00b6 12} The appellate court ignored the relevant reliability factors. Instead, it applied an improper test, focusing myopically on whether the circumstantial evidence available to the sergeant \u201cinfluenced [his] ultimate identification of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1233\">*1233</page-number>Bates as the suspect-driver.\u201d Consideration of each erroneous fact relied upon by the appellate court demonstrates the court\u2019s misplaced reliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">{\u00b6 13} First, Sgt. Franczak explained his failure to arrest Bates upon their first meeting: The department policy mandated direct indictment of any crime not involving a gun or violence. The sergeant did recognize Bates at the initial meeting and stated that he intended to immediately present the evidence to the grand jury for indictment. Given the totality of the circumstances in this case, the failure to arrest immediately has nothing to do with the reliability of the sergeant\u2019s identification testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-7\">{\u00b6 14} Second, the fact that the sergeant never stated that Bates\u2019s twin brother resembled him is a red herring. Despite popular perception, identical twins may appear very different in person. The record contains no evidence that the twins were difficult to tell apart or that they greatly resembled each other. In fact, the defense introduced a photograph that included the twin brother, and Sgt. Franczak stated with certainty that none of the pictured individuals resembled the driver. Without any further evidence, there is no reason for the appellate court to assume that the twins looked alike. The jury was in a much better position to determine whether the twin brother resembled Bates so greatly that the sergeant should have \u201crecognized\u201d him in the photograph as the driver of the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-8\">{\u00b6 15} Finally, the fact that a less suggestive and more reliable method of identification might exist has no bearing on the reliability factors. It only goes to whether the identification procedure was impermissibly suggestive. The jury had all of the facts before it in order to determine whether the identification procedure tainted the sergeant\u2019s identification. The appellate court should have considered that in conjunction with the first part of the test and not with reliability.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-9\">{\u00b6 16} When the actual reliability factors are applied to this case, the sergeant\u2019s identification testimony takes on a different character. Despite Sgt. Franczak\u2019s limited time to view the perpetrator at the scene of the crime, he <em>did </em>have a clear view. As a trained police officer, his degree of attention likely exceeded that of a person untrained in law enforcement. See <em>Manson v. Brathwaite, </em>432 U.S. at 115, 97 S.Ct. 2243, 53 L.Ed.2d 140. He carefully observed the face of the driver as the driver was forced to take the time to get himself through a fence. The sergeant\u2019s general description of the suspect matched that of Bates, and he exhibited certainty in his identification. Finally, only a matter of hours passed between the crime and Sgt. Franczak\u2019s identification of Bates\u2019s LEADS photograph. Courts have regularly upheld the reliability of identification testimony even in light of the weakness of one of the factors. <em>Jells, </em>53 Ohio St.3d at 27, 559 N.E.2d 464; <em>Brathwaite, </em>supra; <em>Neil v. Biggers, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1234\">*1234</page-number>409 U.S. at 200-201, 93 S.Ct. 375, 34 L.Ed.2d 401. Despite Sgt. Franczak\u2019s limited opportunity to view the suspect, the totality of the circumstances indicates reliability.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">{\u00b6 17} The appellate court in this case used improper factors to determine whether the identification procedure was impermissibly suggestive, failed to consider the reliability factors laid out by <em>Biggers, </em>and, instead, overturned Bates\u2019s conviction on the basis that a less suggestive procedure could have been used rather than properly analyzing the actual reliability of the sergeant\u2019s identification in light of <em>Biggers. </em>The issue of whether the suggestive procedure produced a mistaken result is a question for the jury relying on the evidence produced at trial. See <em>Simmons v. United States </em>(1968), 390 U.S. 377, 384, 88 S.Ct. 967, 19 L.Ed.2d 1247. I would hold that the Eighth District invaded the province of the jury by purporting to overturn a conviction based upon reliability when, in fact, the court considered only whether the identification was impermissibly suggestive.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-6\">{\u00b6 18} Although the state and Bates argue only the reliability issue on appeal, a second issue should be addressed: Whether the improper admission of suggestive and unreliable identification testimony requires per se reversal. Once the appellate court determined that the testimony was impermissibly suggestive, it stopped its analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-7\">{\u00b6 19} The United States Supreme Court has held that harmless-error analysis may apply to constitutional errors as long as those errors are not structural in nature. <em>Chapman v. California </em>(1967), 386 U.S. 18, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705; <em>Arizona v. Fulminante </em>(1991), 499 U.S. 279, 306-310, 111 S.Ct. 1246, 113 L.Ed.2d 302. \u201cWhen reviewing the erroneous admission of * * * improperly admitted evidence, [the appellate court] simply reviews the remainder of the evidence against the defendant to determine whether the admission of the [improperly admitted evidence] was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Id., at 310, 111 S.Ct. 1246, 113 L.Ed.2d 302.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-8\">{\u00b6 20} Many federal appellate courts and at least one state appellate court have applied harmless-error analysis in reviewing cases where a trial court erroneously admitted improperly suggestive and unreliable identification testimony. See <em>Carter v. Grams </em>(C.A.7, 2006), 165 Fed.Appx. 480, 2006 WL 222326; <em>United States v. Smith </em>(C.A.3, 2005), 127 Fed.Appx. 608, 613; <em>United States v. Concepcion </em>(C.A.2, 1992), 983 F.2d 369, 379; <em>Souza v. Howard </em>(C.A.1, 1973), 488 F.2d 462, 466; <em>United States v. DeBose </em>(C.A.6, 1970), 433 F.2d 916, 918; <em>Johnson v. State </em>(2000), 246 Ga.App. 239, 243, 539 S.E.2d 914. Although this court has previously recognized that harmless error may apply to constitutional violations, see, e.g., <em>State v. Conway, </em>108 Ohio St.3d 214, 2006-Ohio-791, 842 N.E.2d 996, at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1235\">*1235</page-number>\u00b6 78, it has never explicitly extended this standard of review to the admission of impermissibly suggestive and unreliable identification testimony.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b857-11\">William D. Mason, Cuyahoga County Prosecuting Attorney, and T. Allan Regas, Assistant Prosecuting Attorney, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b857-12\">Law Office of Timothy Farrell Sweeney and Timothy F. Sweeney, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">{\u00b6 21} After determining that Sgt. Franczak\u2019s identification testimony was unreliable, the appellate court merely assumed that the improper admission of this evidence demanded reversal of Bates\u2019s convictions and a new trial. No legal precedent supports the court\u2019s per se reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-7\">{\u00b6 22} In considering whether constitutional error is harmless, a court should determine \u201cwhether there is a reasonable possibility that the evidence complained of might have contributed to the conviction.\u201d <em>Conway, </em>at \u00b6 78, citing <em>Chapman, </em>386 U.S. at 23, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705. See, also, <em>State v. Madrigal </em>(2000), 87 Ohio St.3d 378, 388, 721 N.E.2d 52. The actual identification testimony by the sergeant in this case was only a small piece of evidence indicating Bates\u2019s guilt. Given the amount of circumstantial evidence supporting Bates\u2019s conviction, I would find that any error in the admission of the testimony was harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-8\">{\u00b6 23} Not only did the appellate court improperly vacate a conviction based upon the availability of less suggestive and reliable identification procedures and ignore the well-settled <em>Biggers </em>reliability factors, the court held that the constitutional violation at issue in this case mandated per se reversal instead of applying harmless-error analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-9\">{\u00b6 24} I believe that the appellate court committed multiple errors and that the issues presented here should have been thoroughly addressed by this court. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b857-10\">Lundberg Stratton and O\u2019Donnell, JJ., concur in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b853-9\">. Though it is questionable whether the actual procedure was suggestive or just a product of good police work, the state does not challenge this portion of the analysis. The suggestive aspect in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1232\">*1232</page-number>case appears to be the circumstantial evidence leading the sergeant to the LEADS photograph, not the consideration of a single LEADS photograph that was as likely to exonerate as to condemn the pictured individual.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
