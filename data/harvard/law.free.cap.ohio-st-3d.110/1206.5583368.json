That latter entity is evidently a private agency in Summit County that provides residential community corrections programs. According to the affiant, the judge\u2019s role on the local corrections <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1207\">*1207</page-number>board will impede his ability to preside fairly and impartially over a case in which Oriana House is named as a party.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">{\u00b6 3} Judge Murphy has responded to the affidavit. He acknowledges that he does serve on the Judicial Corrections Board in Summit County and notes that the board oversees the operation of a community-based correctional facility (\u201cCBCF\u201d) there. The defendant, Oriana House, manages the CBCF, according to the judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">{\u00b6 4} This case illustrates the problems that can arise when judges exercise responsibilities more suited to the executive branch of. government. As the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline (\u201cBCGD\u201d) has explained, common pleas judges who serve on judicial corrections boards \u2014 as R.C. 2301.51(A)(1) now allows \u2014 must enter into contracts for buildings, goods, and services and must exercise various other administrative and managerial responsibilities at CBCFs. R.C. 2301.55(A). See BCGD Op. No. 2003-9, advising that common pleas judges should not serve on judicial correction boards. Proper performance of those duties requires judges to hire and terminate employees, choose vendors and oversee the delivery of goods and services, and work with various private and public sector entities to ensure the safe and efficient operation of one or more local CBCFs. In short, judges who serve on judicial corrections boards are responsible for the operation of correctional facilities and programs, and those judges must make financial and employment decisions that fall well outside traditional judicial duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-7\">{\u00b6 5} As Judge Murphy acknowledges, he and his colleagues on the local corrections board in Summit County have selected Oriana House to manage the CBCF there. The judges presumably have an interest in seeing Oriana House succeed in the work that it has been designated by them to perform. And the judges might look with disfavor on any financial or public-relations setbacks suffered by Oriana House, given that those setbacks might adversely affect Oriana\u2019s ability to deliver the services and might ultimately call into question the wisdom of the judges\u2019 decision to contract with Oriana in the first place or to continue doing so. That business relationship between the judges and the defendant creates \u2014 or at least appears to create \u2014 an incentive for the judges to absolve the defendant of any wrongdoing.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-8\">{\u00b6 6} A judge should step aside or be removed if a reasonable and objective observer would harbor serious doubts about the judge\u2019s impartiality. See Canon 3(E)(1) of the Code of Judicial Conduct (\u201cA judge shall disqualify himself or herself in a proceeding in which the judge\u2019s impartiality might reasonably be questioned\u201d); BCGD Op. No.2003-9 (\u201cA judge\u2019s participation on a judicial corrections board casts doubt upon the judge\u2019s impartiality and in so doing demeans the judicial office\u201d). Preservation of public confidence in the integrity of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1208\">*1208</page-number>the judicial system is vitally important, and judicial decisions must be rendered in a manner that does not create a perception of partiality. An appearance of bias can be just as damaging to public confidence as actual bias.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\">{\u00b6 7} Although I have no reason to question Judge Murphy\u2019s ability to be impartial in this matter, the potential conflict between the judge\u2019s administrative duties on the board and his judicial duties on the bench might well cause a reasonable and objective observer to question the judge\u2019s impartiality. As this court said more than seven decades ago, \u201c[i]t is of vital importance that the litigant should believe that he will have a fair trial.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Turner v. Marshall </em>(1931), 123 Ohio St. 586, 587, 176 N.E. 454. Because the plaintiff in this case has called into question the fairness of the judge\u2019s dual roles, and because a reasonable and objective observer might well share those concerns, I conclude that the affidavit of disqualification should be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">{\u00b6 8} Moreover, because all of the general division judges in Summit County serve on the same judicial corrections board, I will appoint (by separate entry) a judge not affiliated with that board to preside over all further trial proceedings in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-6\">{\u00b6 9} For the reasons stated above, the affidavit of disqualification is granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
