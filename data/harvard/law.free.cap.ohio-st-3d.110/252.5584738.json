The parties filed competing discovery motions, presenting the issue whether the governor\u2019s claim of executive privilege over those weekly reports is valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-12\">{\u00b6 2} The governor urged this court to recognize an absolute privilege, a suggestion all members of this court rejected. <em>State ex rel. Dann v. Taft, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 364, 2006-Ohio-1825, 848 N.E.2d 472 <em>(\u201cDann v. Taft </em>I\u201d). By contrast, courts in several states recognized absolute gubernatorial executive privilege as early as the 19th Century as a matter of common law based on principles of separation of powers. See Annotation, Construction and Application, Under State Law, of Doctrine of \u201cExecutive Privilege\u201d (1981), 10 A.L.R.4th 355, 357. Absolute privilege is based on the theory that \u201cthe coequal status of the legislative, executive, and judicial branches would be disrupted if one branch, the judiciary, were empowered to compel another branch, the executive, to disclose information against its will.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-13\">{\u00b6 3} Some form of executive privilege has long been accorded the executive branch by state courts as a matter of the common law of evidence, including courts in Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Vermont, and Wisconsin. See Annotation, supra, 10 A.L.R.4th 355, Sections 2(b) and 4. See, also, <em>Nero v. Hyland </em>(1978), 76 N.J. 213, 386 A.2d 846; <em>Guy v. Judicial Nominating Comm. </em>(Del.Super.1995), 659 A.2d 777; <em>Wilson v. Los Angeles Cty. Super. Court </em>(1996), 51 Cal.App.4th 1136, 59 Cal.Rptr.2d 537.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-14\">{\u00b6 4} Consistent with this weight of authority, this court recognized not an absolute but a qualified gubernatorial-communications privilege in <em>Dann v. Taft I, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>109 Ohio St.3d 364, 2006-Ohio-1825, 848 N.E.2d 472. We drew upon the decisions of a number of federal and state courts in crafting a three-step analytical framework for Ohio courts to follow when required to resolve a conflict between a requester of gubernatorial communications and a governor who claims that those communications are privileged. Id. at \u00b6 62-72.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">{\u00b6 5} We initiated the process established in <em>Dann v. Taft I </em>by issuing an order allowing Governor Taft to formally assert the gubernatorial-communications privilege and authorizing Dann to thereafter submit a statement describing his particularized need to review any weekly reports the governor might assert to be privileged. Id. at \u00b6 74.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">{\u00b6 6} Governor Taft timely submitted a sworn affidavit stating that he had provided Dann with all the communications Dann had sought regarding the BWC and asserting the qualified gubernatorial-communications privilege as to other documents. See <em>State ex rel. Dann v. Taft, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 1, 2006-Ohio-2947, 850 N.E.2d 27 <em>(\u201cDann v. Taft II\u201d). </em>Dann thereafter proffered his assertion of particularized need to obtain the documents withheld by the governor.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">{\u00b6 7} In his proffer, Dann stated that he, as an Ohio employer, had contributed to the Ohio Workers\u2019 Compensation Fund. Id. at \u00b6 11. That assertion arguably could have met the test for particularized need if the governor possessed the records that Dann said the governor possessed. But Dann also claimed that he was \u201ca taxpayer who paid taxes into the general fund used to finance the operations of most of the state departments and agencies reporting to Governor Taft\u201d and had \u201cpaid gasoline taxes used to finance the operations of the Ohio Department of Transportation and the State Highway Patrol.\u201d He stated that he believed that he had \u201cevery reason to be concerned\u201d that a \u201cclimate of corruption\u201d had affected state government agencies other than the BWC and that he had made his public records request \u201c[a]s a taxpayer\u201d because he was considering pursuing a taxpayers\u2019 action \u201cto enjoin illegal contract or other unauthorized use of public funds and, where appropriate, to recoup the lost funds.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b565-9\">{\u00b6 8} That basis for asserting particularized need goes far afield of Dann\u2019s complaint in mandamus and is not appropriately asserted in this case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>assuming that Dann\u2019s status as an Ohio taxpayer could serve as a premise for particularized need, it would not be sufficient in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">{\u00b6 9} In order to overcome an assertion of qualified gubernatorial-communications privilege, a requester \u201cmust demonstrate particularized, rather than generalized, need and explain why that need outweighs the qualified privilege.\u201d <em>Dann v. Taft I, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 364, 2006-Ohio-1825, 848 N.E.2d 472, \u00b6 67. Dann\u2019s status as a taxpayer who paid taxes into the general fund and paid gasoline taxes is shared by nearly all adult Ohio citizens. There is nothing particularized about a need asserted on that basis. Nor would the fact that Dann may be contemplating the filing of a taxpayer suit alleging unspecified misconduct on the part of government officials demonstrate a particularized need, because, in the absence of statutory authority, a taxpayer in his position lacks standing to file a taxpayer suit. <em>State ex rel. Masterson v. Ohio State Racing Comm. </em>(1954), 162 Ohio St. 366, 55 O.O. 215, 123 N.E.2d 1. Ohio law does not authorize a private Ohio citizen, acting individually and without official authority, to prosecute government officials suspected of misconduct based on the citizen\u2019s status as a taxpayer of general taxes, including the gasoline tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">{\u00b6 10} In contrast, longstanding Ohio law does recognize that a taxpayer with a \u201cspecial interest\u201d in particular public funds has standing to seek equitable relief in a court of equity to remedy a wrong committed by public officers in the management of those funds. Id.; <em>Racing Guild of Ohio, Local 304, Serv. Emps. Internatl. Union, AFL-CIO v. Ohio State Racing Comm. </em>(1986), 28 Ohio St.3d 317, 28 OBR 386, 503 N.E.2d 1025. Dann arguably has a \u201cspecial interest\u201d in the management of the Worker\u2019s Compensation Fund because he had paid into that fund as an employer. <em>Dann v. Taft II, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 1, 2006-Ohio-2947, 850 N.E.2d 27, \u00b6 16. It is the existence of that arguable special interest in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Fund that differentiates Dann\u2019s need to access gubernatorial communications concerning that fund from his generalized need to review communications regarding other Ohio executive departments. Dann confined his complaint to seeking communications relating to the BWC, and he has failed to state a credible theory that he has standing to initiate a taxpayer action based on his speculations of misconduct on the part of departments and agencies other than the BWC.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>{\u00b6 11} In his assertion of the gubernatorial-communications privilege, the governor stated that he had \u201cvoluntarily waived executive privilege as to any Weekly Reports pertaining to the BWC\u201d and had already provided Dann \u201call the information he sought related to the BWC.\u201d Dann has repeatedly claimed, without supporting affidavits or other evidence, that the governor possesses records relating to the BWC that would implicate the governor in some inappropriate conduct. The governor by sworn affidavit responded that he had provided Dann with all communications regarding the BWC. We ordered the governor to submit the communications under seal to the court for our in camera review in order to resolve the factual issue. <em>Dann v. Taft II, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 1, 2006-Ohio-2947, 850 N.E.2d 27. In this unusual case,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> resolution of the factual dispute between the parties relating to the contents of the records is potentially dispositive of the cause. If the governor has, in fact, already provided Dann all weekly reports that related to Dann\u2019s arguable need for information relative to the BWC, then Dann no longer has any need, either particularized or generalized, for disclosure of additional records.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\">{\u00b6 12} The governor complied with the order issued in <em>Dann v. Taft II </em>by submitting documents in three categories: (1) unredacted versions of documents previously provided to Dann in redacted format, (2) documents previously withheld from Dann that contain no reference to the BWC, and (3) copies of documents that had been previously provided to Dann in redacted form. The justices of this court have reviewed all of these documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">{\u00b6 13} Despite Dann\u2019s repeated assertions that the governor withheld from public scrutiny certain documents, our careful review of the voluminous documents submitted by the governor produces two factual conclusions: (1) none of the redactions made by the governor in the weekly reports already provided to Dann relate to the BWC or to any persons doing business with the BWC and (2) none of the other weekly reports withheld from Dann, but submitted to this court, include information relating to the BWC. Our review verifies the governor\u2019s statements that the documents submitted to the court for in camera review do not contain any materials concerning the BWC that have not previously been disclosed to Dann. Accordingly we need not proceed beyond the second step of the procedural framework prescribed in <em>Dann v. Taft I, </em>because Dann has failed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>to meet his burden of demonstrating particularized need. However, in this seminal case, disposition of that issue does not fully resolve the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">{\u00b6 14} The complaint in mandamus filed in this case required the court, for the first time, to consider whether Ohio should recognize a gubernatorial executive privilege. Most cases raising issues concerning executive privilege are resolved pursuant to the common law, i.e., no statute or express constitutional provision is implicated. See, e.g., <em>Herald Assn., Inc. v. Dean </em>(2002), 174 Vt. 350, 816 A.2d 469. Rather, they are decided pursuant to fundamental principles of American government \u2014 the distribution of equal power among the three branches of government. See, e.g., <em>Office of Governor v. Washington Post Co. </em>(2000), 360 Md. 520, 759 A.2d 249. It is not uncommon for courts of last resort to be the final arbiters of the fair and appropriate distribution of these powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">{\u00b6 15} In <em>Dann v. Taft II, </em>we did not prescribe the bounds of the qualified gubernatorial-communications privilege, preferring to do that in the context of the submission of communications for which the governor might assert the privilege. The full contents of the communications, including their possibly sensitive nature, were then unknown to us. It is now in the best interest of this governor, and particularly, future governors and the public, that we more precisely define the scope of that privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">{\u00b6 16} The governor stated as follows in asserting qualified gubernatorial-communications privilege:</p>\n<p id=\"b568-8\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cI want to make clear that I am not asserting the privilege with respect to any documents requested by Senator Dann that contain information pertaining to the Ohio Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation (\u2018BWC\u2019). In fact, I have waived any privilege related to the hundreds of documents that have already been provided to Senator Dann. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b568-9\">{\u00b6 18} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b568-10\">{\u00b6 19} \u201c * * * These reports and/or redacted material contain information pertaining to other cabinet agencies or other matters unrelated to the BWC.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-11\">{\u00b6 20} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b568-12\">{\u00b6 21} \u201c * * * I personally reviewed these reports each week and relied on them to assist me in identifying issues that raised potential policy concerns, required my direct attention or input, or needed further review by my office. In addition, I used these weekly reports (and those from the other Executive Assistants and cabinet directors) as a tool for structuring my internal staff meetings, which are an important part of the process I use to deliberate on issues, formulate policy and make decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-13\">{\u00b6 22} \u201c * * * Based on my review of the Business and Industry Weekly Reports, I conclude that they all meet the criteria for the gubernatorial-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>communications privilege because they are communications from the Executive Assistant for Business and Industry that were prepared for the purpose of fostering informed and sound gubernatorial deliberations, policymaking, and decisionmaking. None of the Business and Industry Weekly Reports for which I am now asserting the privilege contain information related to the BWC.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">{\u00b6 23} In his memorandum accompanying his affidavit, weekly reports to the governor were described as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">{\u00b6 24} \u201c[T]he Weekly Reports in question contain information relayed confidentially by businesses considering closing or opening an office, plant, or research facility in Ohio, and other confidential information about business expansion plans or state incentive offers. * * * Weekly Reports also contain information about hiring/personnel action such as disciplining an employee or recruiting a potential new hire. * * * Weekly Reports also contain information with respect to the Governor\u2019s legislative strategy. * * * Such sensitive and timely information from the Governor\u2019s advisors that relays significant events, areas of concern, and other issues warrants the Governor\u2019s attention and may require action by the Governor in the form of advice, recommendation, or a decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">{\u00b6 25} \u201cThe confidentiality of the Weekly Reports allows the Governor to have open and honest communications from his cabinet directors and policy advisors. Weekly Reports aid gubernatorial deliberations, policymaking, and decisionmaking by giving the Governor timely information coupled with the opportunity to reflect upon the information and discuss it with key advisors or obtain additional information or clarification before he has to formulate a response or make a decision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b569-9\">{\u00b6 26} These statements imply that the governor deems the full contents of all written weekly reports from executive staff members to be within the scope of the qualified gubernatorial-communications privilege described in <em>Dann v. Taft I. </em>That conclusion is not unreasonable in view of the general definition announced in <em>Dann v. Taft I. </em>But that interpretation is too broad, and we now define qualified gubernatorial-communications privilege more precisely.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-10\">{\u00b6 27} Initially we note that all the members of this court, including those who dissented in <em>Dann v. Taft I, </em>agreed that some form of common-law executive privilege should be accorded Ohio governors. One justice writing separately observed that \u201c[ljying at the heart of the executive privilege for presidential <em>or gubernatorial </em>communications \u2018is the necessity for protection of the public interest in candid, objective, and even blunt or harsh opinions in Presidential <em>[or gubernatorial] </em>decisionmaking. A President <em>[or governor] </em>and those who assist him must be free to explore alternatives in the process of shaping policies and making decisions and to do so in a way many would be unwilling to express except privately.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Dann v. Taft </em>I, 109 Ohio St.3d 364, 2006-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>Ohio-1825, 848 N.E.2d 472, \u00b6 76 (Resnick, J., dissenting), quoting <em>United States v. Nixon </em>(1974), 418 U.S. 683, 708, 94 S.Ct. 3090, 41 L.Ed.2d 1039.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">{\u00b6 28} The second dissenting justice wrote: \u201cCertainly, the governor is entitled to privacy in the making of decisions, and, to that end, the common law recognizes the \u2018deliberative process\u2019 privilege. The deliberative-process privilege \u2018allows the government to withhold documents and other materials that would reveal \u201cadvisory opinions, recommendations and deliberations comprising part of a process by which governmental decisions and policies are formulated.\u201d \u2019 <em>In re Sealed Case </em>(C.A.D.C.1997), 121 F.3d 729, 737, quoting <em>Carl Zeiss Stiftung v. V.E.B. Carl Zeiss, Jena </em>(D.D.C.1966), 40 F.R.D. 318, 324. The aim of the privilege is to encourage unrestrained debate in the formulation of policy, but to keep public purely factual information.\u201d 109 Ohio St.3d 364, 2006-Ohio-1825, 848 N.E.2d 472, at \u00b6 89 (Pfeifer, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">{\u00b6 29} The differences reflected in the several opinions in <em>Dann v. Taft I </em>were not differences regarding the propriety of recognizing an executive privilege for a governor, a privilege widely recognized throughout the country. Rather, the opinions reflect different views as to the procedural burdens to be placed on the competing parties when a governor has been the subject of a public-records request but refuses to comply. The majority accorded the governor a presumption that his invocation of gubernatorial-communications privilege was appropriate in the absence of a demonstration by a requester of particularized need to review the documents. Those who dissented believed that an Ohio governor should not benefit from such a presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">(\u00b6 30} Many courts have recognized that the scope of a governor\u2019s executive privilege overlaps the more general deliberative-process privilege in significant ways. The differences between the gubernatorial-communications privilege we recognized in <em>Dann v. Taft I </em>and the deliberative-process privilege primarily concern the underpinnings of the two privileges and the identity of individuals entitled to assert them. As we observed in <em>Dann v. Taft I, </em>the gubernatorial-communications privilege is grounded on the constitutional principle of separation of powers, while the deliberative-process privilege is grounded in the common law of evidence. Id. at \u00b6 43. The deliberative-process privilege is actually broader in one sense than the gubernatorial-communications privilege because it may be asserted by various executive officials, while only a governor may assert the gubernatorial-communications privilege. Id. at \u00b6 42.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">{\u00b6 31} It is clear from <em>Dann v. Taft I </em>that it is initially the governor\u2019s decision to assert gubernatorial-communications privilege when gubernatorial documents are requested by a member of the public. However, we also stated in <em>Dann v. Taft I: </em>\u201cThe gubernatorial-communications privilege protects the public by allowing the state\u2019s chief executive the freedom that is required <em>to make </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>decisions.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 109 Ohio St.3d 364, 2006-Ohio-1825, 848 N.E.2d 472, \u00b6 56. We recognized that the privilege advances the public\u2019s interest in sound <em>executive decisionmaking. </em>Id., citing <em>United States v. Nixon, </em>418 U.S. at 708, 94 S.Ct. 3090, 41 L.Ed.2d 1039. In addition we cautioned that executive privilege \u201cshould not be lightly invoked.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 70.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">{\u00b6 32} Our recognition of a qualified gubernatorial-communications privilege did not equate to a judicial stamp of imprimatur on blanket secrecy of all written communications to or from the governor. Nothing in <em>Dann v. Taft I </em>warrants the conclusion that a governor may invoke the privilege to exempt from the Public Records Act purely informational public records not associated with a specific issue requiring contemporaneous decisionmaking of the governor.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">{\u00b6 33} The fact that a public record possessed by a governor has some privileged content does not justify a governor in withholding the nonprivileged portions of the public record from a Public Records Act requester. Our review of the weekly reports provided to us by the governor for in camera review prompts us to clarify that many written communications to and from the governor simply do not concern \u201csensitive decisional and consultative responsibilities of the Governor\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and have little if anything to do with gubernatorial policymaking or decisionmaking except in the most general way. To be considered \u201cmade for the purpose of fostering informed and sound gubernatorial deliberations, policymaking, and decisionmaking,\u201d and thus subject to the exemption created by the General Assembly for \u201crecords the release of which is prohibited by state or federal law,\u201d R.C. 149.43(A)(l)(v), communications must rise above the merely informational and must possess some attribute of being \u201cadvisory, investigatory, decisional, consultative, deliberative, or sensitive\u201d in nature. Cf. <em>Dann v. Taft I, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 364, 2006-Ohio-1825, 848 N.E.2d 472, at \u00b6 81 (Resnick, J., dissenting). Purely informational communications that serve as status reports for the governor relating to the activities of a subordinate or an executive department do not fall within the scope of the gubernatorial-communications privilege and are thus not exempt from the Public Records Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">{\u00b6 34} It follows that many written communications to the governor remain, subject to disclosure pursuant to the Public Records Act, R.C. 149.43. The governor is not generally exempt from the purview of the Public Records Act simply because he or she possesses a qualified privilege to withhold from the public communications integral to gubernatorial deliberations, policymaking, and decisionmaking. When in doubt whether information requested falls within the scope of the privilege, the governor should disclose it.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>{\u00b6 35} In order to be protected by the qualified privilege, the communication must relate directly to a specific decision required of or sought from the governor. It must be used by the governor in the process of arriving at a decision. An example of such a circumstance would be the following: Two bills introduced in the General Assembly relate to the distribution of electricity by companies regulated by the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio. One bill would be economically attractive to individual consumers of electricity, and the other bill would offer incentives to industrial users of electricity. The governor has been requested to state his or her support or opposition to each of the bills, which arguably benefit different groups of consumers. Written communications are submitted to the governor arguing for and against his support of the legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">{\u00b6 36} Those communications would be privileged because they would be used to assist the governor in making a decision with respect to a specific issue. A memo to the governor regarding only the status of the legislation, i.e., one that requires the governor to make no decision, would not be privileged.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">{\u00b6 37} We recognize that a governor could argue that every piece of information, every communication, virtually every conversation, collectively inform a governor, building the governor\u2019s reservoir of useful knowledge available to every gubernatorial decision. Such an application of gubernatorial privilege is over-broad. Also outside the bounds of the privilege are observations in communications to the governor that merely reflect unfavorably upon an individual or an entity.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">{\u00b6 38} There is another category of topics that find their way into communications to a governor that, while not protected by a gubernatorial privilege, may be shielded from public access by legislation or other principles of law. Such topics include communications regarding trade secrets or the security of an individual, a building, or a community.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">{\u00b6 39} Our review of the weekly reports submitted to the governor in this case causes us to conclude that most of the communications are status reports, information regarding upcoming events, reports regarding plans of various companies relating to their business where a decision by the company is probably now public, and miscellaneous reports on topical current events. Documents of that nature are not covered by the qualified executive privilege and are therefore subject to disclosure pursuant to R.C. 149.43.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-9\">{\u00b6 40} Another category of the communications submitted by the governor for our review is composed of reports that, at the time the report was given to the governor, provided information regarding economic or business decisions of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>companies. Such reports arguably should be confidential until a public announcement is made by the company. It is not possible for us to determine from the records submitted by the governor whether such memoranda, most of which were prepared in 2003, should continue to be confidential.

In analogous cases in other jurisdictions, it is clear that the governor actually possessed the records sought by the moving party. See, e.g., <em>Wilson v. Los Angeles Cty. Super.

He has requested and received from this court a protective privilege that is rarely afforded to presidents. Yet in the final analysis, these records have proved to be so innocuous, mundane, and unrelated to the decisional process that the five members of the majority who originally graced the governor with a presumptive privilege have been compelled to find them unworthy of protection even though the relator has purportedly failed to meet the majority\u2019s requirement of particularized need.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-11\">{\u00b6 44} The governor has seriously misrepresented the nature and import of the information contained within the disputed weekly reports in his efforts to secure an executive privilege in this case, and he should bear the inevitable consequences. The governor should not be saved by the majority\u2019s mysterious decision to deny the writ while rejecting the governor\u2019s attempt to invoke the privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-12\">{\u00b6 45} In rejecting the governor\u2019s claim of privilege as to the records submitted under seal, the majority concludes that \u201cmost, if not all, of the communications submitted by the governor are not protected by the qualified executive privilege and are therefore subject to R.C. 149.43.\u201d See \u00b6 41. Quoting from my dissent in <em>State ex rel. Dann v. Taft, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 364, 2006-Ohio-1825, 848 N.E.2d 472, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>at \u00b6 8 <em>(\u201cDann v. Taft I </em>\u201d), the majority now clarifies that to fall within the scope of the gubernatorial-communications privilege, \u201ccommunications must rise above the merely informational, and must possess some attribute of being \u2018advisory, investigatory, decisional, consultative, deliberative, or sensitive\u2019 in nature.\u201d See \u00b6 33.1 concur in this aspect of the majority\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">{\u00b6 46} In denying the writ, however, the majority places the proverbial cart before the horse by requiring the relator to show a particularized need for documents that are not covered by the privilege in the first place. The governor has waived any privilege with respect to communications pertaining to the Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation (\u201cBWC\u201d), and the majority has found that the withheld documents \u201care not covered by the qualified executive privilege and are therefore subject to disclosure pursuant to R.C. 149.43.\u201d See \u00b6 39. Why, then, should Dann be required to show a particularized need for any of the records? It makes no sense to impose a requirement that arises only by virtue of a privilege that is not applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">{\u00b6 47} According to the majority, \u201cDann confined his complaint to seeking communications relating to the BWC.\u201d See \u00b6 10. Thus, the majority denies Dann\u2019s request for a writ of mandamus because \u201call weekly reports relating to the BWC have previously been provided to him by the governor.\u201d See \u00b6 42.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">{\u00b6 48} I cannot agree with the majority\u2019s finding that Dann\u2019s requests have been limited to information concerning the BWC. While Dann\u2019s original complaint was primarily directed at obtaining BWC-related records, it also alleged that \u201c[o]n June 16, 2005, the Relator made three additional written requests pursuant to the Ohio Public Records Act. The first request sought weekly memoranda and other periodic reports from James Samuel (Governor\u2019s liaison to the BWC) and/or his predecessors to the Office of the Governor for the years 1998-2005.\u201d In a related affidavit, which was filed with the court nine months before it decided <em>Dann v. Taft I, </em>Dann specifically stated, \u201cAlthough the BWC scandals motivated my request, I wanted the weekly reports for all information they contained concerning state government operations whether or not they involved the BWC.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">{\u00b6 49} Moreover, if Dann\u2019s requests were actually limited to records pertaining to the BWC, there would have been no controversy for the court to decide in the first instance. Long before the court decided the issue of privilege in <em>Dann v. Taft I, </em>the governor had waived the assertion of any privilege over weekly reports or portions thereof concerning the BWC. There was simply no need to determine in <em>Dann v. Taft I </em>whether a privilege attaches to those records, since the governor was no longer asserting a privilege over them. But the court did decide the issue of privilege with respect to something that was in dispute, and that something was the only weekly reports for which the governor continued to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>seek protection under the executive privilege, i.e., the weekly reports from Samuel that do not contain information relating to the BWC.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">{\u00b6 50} Accordingly, I concur in the majority\u2019s decision to the extent that it finds the gubernatorial-communications privilege inapplicable to the withheld reports, but dissent from its decision to deny the writ of mandamus and require Dann to reassert his request for the Samuel reports. It is pointless to insist that Dann must take still more action under R.C. 149.43 to obtain disclosure of these documents. The governor should not be afforded any further opportunity to delay the release of these public records.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b575-6\">Pfeifer, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AG7\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">{\u00b6 51} Our in camera review of the records the governor sought to withhold reveals a collection of information so inane, so inconsequential, and so insignificant that taken together it could not generate one interesting newspaper story. But it has generated still another opinion by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">{\u00b6 52} I do not choose to reargue or reinterpret <em>Taft I. </em>As for the question arising today, we can all agree that the reports at issue are public records and that the governor may exert no privilege to prevent their disclosure. I depart from the majority\u2019s determination to deny a writ of mandamus. Relator has asked for all the records that this court determines today to be public. For instance, in his public records request of June 16, 2005, relator requested from the governor \u201c[a]ll weekly memoranda, weekly reports, or other periodic reports required by statute or office procedure or practice from James Samuel and James Samuel\u2019s predecessor(s) to the Governor from the years 1998-2005.\u201d That same request became the basis for part of relator\u2019s complaint in mandamus. At paragraph ten of his complaint, relator states:</p>\n<p id=\"b575-9\">{\u00b6 53} \u201c(10) On June 16, 2005, the Relator made three additional written requests pursuant to the Ohio Public Records Act. The first request sought weekly memoranda and other periodic reports from James Samuel (Governor\u2019s liaison to the BWC) and/or his predecessors to the Office of the Governor for the years 1998-2005.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b575-10\">{\u00b6 54} Relator asserted in his complaint for mandamus that the governor failed to provide the requested records and sought a writ of mandamus to force their disclosure. Relator did not limit his public records request or his complaint in mandamus to Samuel\u2019s memoranda specifically relating to the BWC. He asked for all of the reports. The governor released to relator only reports relating to the BWC. But that was not an act of largesse by the governor; it was a failure to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>respond completely to the relator\u2019s legitimate public records request. No matter what the relator\u2019s particular area of interest was, he asked for <em>all </em>of the Samuel memoranda.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b576-7\">Gittes &amp; Schulte, Frederick M. Gittes, and Kathaleen B. Schulte, for relator.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b576-8\">Jim Petro, Attorney General, and Porter, Wright, Morris &amp; Arthur, L.L.P., Kathleen M. Trafford, and Bryan R. Faller, for respondent.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">{\u00b6 55} If the majority is right that relator sought only records specifically relating to the BWC, then much of this court\u2019s time and many trees have been needlessly sacrificed. Could it be true that all of this litigation was over a bunch of records that no one ever asked for? If so, this matter could have been solved well short of this court\u2019s creation of a gubernatorial-communications privilege. The governor need merely have said, \u201cI gave relator everything he asked for.\u201d What the governor really did was to claim that everything was privileged, but released the records he deemed relevant to the relator\u2019s interest. The balance of what relator sought has been the focus of this matter. Today we hold that all of those records are public.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">{\u00b6 56} Accordingly, since the relator had a right to see everything he sought, I would grant the writ of mandamus. Further, I would award attorney fees to the relator, since he meets this court\u2019s two-pronged test for such an award. First, the public has an unquestioned interest in the competent and ethical administration of the state\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation system, and so relator has established a public benefit. Second, the respondent has failed to comply with this legitimate records request for invalid reasons. <em>State ex rel. Toledo Blade Co. v.
