For the reasons that follow, we reverse the judgment. The writ is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">I. Community-Based Correctional Facilities and Programs</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">{\u00b6 2} Under R.C. 2301.51(A)(1), \u201c[t]he court of common pleas of any county that has a population of two hundred thousand or more may formulate a community-based correctional proposal that, upon implementation, would provide a community-based correctional facility and program [\u2018CBCF\u2019] for the use of that court in accordance with sections 2301.51 to 2301.56 of the Revised Code.\u201d Each \u201ccounty\u2019s community-based correctional facilities and programs shall be administered by a judicial corrections board [\u2018JCB\u2019],\u201d which is comprised of judges of the common pleas court. R.C. .2301.51(A)(1). As of August 2004, there were 18 CBCFs operating in Ohio pursuant to R.C. 2301.51(A)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">{\u00b6 3} A JCB must submit its proposal for the establishment of a CBCF to the Division of Parole and Community Services of the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction (\u201cODRC\u201d). R.C. 2301.51(B)(1). If the ODRC approves the proposal, the JCB \u201cmay establish and operate the facility and program addressed by the proposal\u201d and may request funding from the board of county commissioners and the ODRC. R.C. 2301.51(C) and 2301.56(A). The proposal must meet certain minimum standards, including a general treatment program and the designation of a facility that will be used for the confinement of persons sentenced to the facility. R.C. 2301.52.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-8\">{\u00b6 4} CBCFs are \u201cpublic offices under section 117.01 of the Revised Code and are subject to audit under section 117.10 of the Revised Code.\u201d R.C. 2301.56(E)(1). \u201cIf a private or nonprofit entity performs the day-to-day operation of any [CBCF] * * *, the private or nonprofit entity also is subject to financial audits under section 117.10 of the Revised Code, and, in addition, in [certain] circumstances * * *, to performance audits by the auditor of state.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-9\">{\u00b6 5} In 1987, the judges of the Summit County Court of Common Pleas formed the Summit County JCB and submitted a proposal to the ODRC to operate a CBCF for Summit County. The ODRC approved the proposal. The Summit County JCB contracted with appellant, Oriana House, Inc., to operate the Summit County CBCF.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-10\">{\u00b6 6} Oriana House is a private, nonprofit Ohio corporation that was first incorporated in 1981. Oriana House has a six-member board of directors; none of the directors holds public office. Oriana House receives all of the state funding granted to the Summit County CBCF by the ODRC. In 2001, Oriana House had over $25 million in income, approximately 88 percent of which was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>from public sources. Summit County JCB has permitted Oriana House to operate the CBCF without oversight.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\">{\u00b67} Since 1981, James J. Lawrence has served as president and chief executive officer of Oriana House, and for at least a few years, he also served as director of the Summit County CBCF. Lawrence signed the Summit County CBCF grant application for fiscal years 2002 and 2003 in his capacity as director of the Summit County CBCF. Summit County CBCF\u2019s grant application for fiscal year 2005 was signed by Judge Mary F. Spicer, chairperson of the Summit County JCB. The grantee is the Summit County CBCF.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">II. Audit of Oriana House</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">{\u00b6 8} In January 2003, appellee, State Auditor Betty Montgomery, announced her intention to conduct a special audit of the Summit County CBCF and Oriana House. Montgomery was investigating transactions between Oriana House, Lawrence, and Correctional Health Services, Inc., a for-profit, wholly owned subsidiary of Oriana House. Oriana House, its wholly owned subsidiary, and Lawrence sought declaratory and injunctive relief against several defendants, including Montgomery, in the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas. Oriana House moved to enjoin Montgomery from conducting special audits of the Summit County CBCF, Oriana House, its subsidiary, and Lawrence, and from issuing subpoenas seeking bank records or other documents of Lawrence or Correctional Health Services, Inc. The trial court denied the motion. On appeal, the court of appeals affirmed. <em>Oriana House, Inc. v. Montgomery, </em>Franklin App. No. 03AP-1178, 2004-Ohio-4788, 2004 WL 2008473. The court of appeals held that Oriana House, \u201cwhile not a public office, is nonetheless subject to audit.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 18. We affirmed that portion of the court of appeals judgment, holding that Montgomery has the authority to conduct a special audit of Oriana House. <em>Oriana House, Inc. v. Montgomery, </em>108 Ohio St.3d 419, 2006-Ohio-1325, 844 N.E.2d 323.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">III. Records Requests and Mandamus Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b770-8\">{\u00b6 9} Oriana House requested access to certain records relating to Montgomery\u2019s audit under R.C. 149.43, Ohio\u2019s Public Records Act. Montgomery provided full or partial access to some records and denied access to others.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-9\">{\u00b6 10} In May 2004, Oriana House filed complaints in the Court of Appeals for Franklin County for a writ of mandamus to compel Montgomery to provide access to the requested records. The court of appeals consolidated Oriana House\u2019s cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-10\">{\u00b6 11} On March 31, 2004, Montgomery requested that Oriana House provide access to personnel files for certain Oriana House employees, including Lawrence, records and supporting documents of transactions between Oriana House <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>and certain entities and Lawrence, records identifying accounts used by Oriana House, and travel reports for certain persons. On April 13, 2004, Montgomery reiterated her previous records request and also asked for certain records relating to contract and state employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">{\u00b6 12} Oriana House rejected Montgomery\u2019s requests, claiming that it was not required to produce the requested records because it is not a public office as defined in R.C. Chapter 149. On June 4, 2004, Montgomery filed her answer to Oriana House\u2019s consolidated mandamus cases and submitted a counterclaim for a writ of mandamus to compel Oriana House to provide access to the requested records.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">{\u00b6 13} The court of appeals entered a judgment granting in part and denying in part Oriana House\u2019s and Montgomery\u2019s requests for writs of mandamus. The court of appeals held that Montgomery was entitled to a writ of mandamus to compel Oriana House to provide access to the requested records concerning its operation of the Summit County CBCF because Oriana House is a public institution and thus a public office for purposes of the Public Records Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-7\">{\u00b6 14} This cause is now before us upon Oriana House\u2019s appeal as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-8\">IV. R.C. 149.43</p>\n<p id=\"b771-9\">{\u00b6 15} The court of appeals granted Montgomery\u2019s request for a writ of mandamus to compel Oriana House to provide access to the requested records, including certain employee personnel files, under R.C. 149.43. \u201cMandamus is the appropriate remedy to compel compliance with R.C. 149.43, Ohio\u2019s Public Records Act.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Dispatch Printing Co. v. Johnson, </em>106 Ohio St.3d 160, 2005-Ohio-4384, 833 N.E.2d 274, \u00b6 16. \u201cWe construe R.C. 149.43 liberally in favor of broad access and resolve any doubt in favor of disclosing records.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Plain Dealer Publishing Co. v. Cleveland, </em>106 Ohio St.3d 70, 2005-Ohio-3807, 831 N.E.2d 987, \u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-10\">{\u00b6 16} We must determine whether the court of appeals was correct in its determination that Oriana House, a private, nonprofit corporation managing the day-to-day operations of the Summit County CBCF, is a public office for purposes of the Public Records Act. \u201c \u2018Public record\u2019 means records kept by any public office.\u201d R.C. 149.43(A)(1). \u201c \u2018Public office\u2019 includes any state agency, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>public institution, political subdivision, or any other organized body, office, agency, institution, or entity established by the laws of this state for the exercise of any function of government.\u201d R.C. 149.011(A). Montgomery does not assert that Oriana House is a state agency, political subdivision, or other organized body, office, agency, institution, or entity established by the laws of this state for the exercise of any function of government. Instead, Montgomery contends\u2014 and the court of appeals held \u2014 that Oriana House is a \u201cpublic institution\u201d under R.C. 149.011(A) and is thus subject to R.C. 149.43.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">V. Public Institutions</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">{\u00b6 17} In <em>State ex rel. Fox v. Cuyahoga Cty. Hosp. Sys. </em>(1988), 39 Ohio St.3d 108, 529 N.E.2d 443, we first addressed the question of what constitutes a public institution for purposes of the Public Records Act. In that case, we held that \u201c[a] public hospital, which renders a public service to residents of a county and which is supported by public taxation, is a \u2018public institution\u2019 and thus a \u2018public office\u2019 pursuant to R.C. 149.011(A), making it subject to the public records disclosure requirements of R.C. 149.43.\u201d Id. at paragraph one of the syllabus. In so holding, we relied on a previous case that did not involve a public-records claim:</p>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cUnder <em>Halaby [v. Bd. of Directors of Univ. of Cincinnati </em>(1954), 162 Ohio St. 290, 298, 55 O.O. 171, 123 N.E.2d 3] an entity organized for rendering service to the residents of its community and supported by public taxation is deemed a public institution. The Cuyahoga County Hospital System renders a public service to residents of Cuyahoga County and is supported by public taxation. As such, it is a \u2018public institution\u2019 and thus a \u2018public office\u2019 pursuant to R.C. 149.011(A).\u201d <em>Fox, </em>39 Ohio St.3d at 110, 529 N.E.2d 443.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-8\">{\u00b6 19} Based on <em>Fox, </em>we have used a three-part test for determining whether a hospital is a public institution \u2014 and therefore a public office \u2014 for purposes of the Public Records Act. <em>State ex rel. Stys v. Parma Community Gen. Hosp. </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 438, 440, 755 N.E.2d 874. \u201cThus, if we find that a particular hospital is a public hospital, renders a public service to residents, and is supported by public taxation, we must hold that it is a public office required to disclose its public records.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Fostoria Daily Rev. Co. v. Fostoria Hosp. Assn. </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 10, 12, 531 N.E.2d 313.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-9\">{\u00b6 20} In public-records cases involving an entity that is not a hospital, we have applied a two-part test emphasizing the public-service and tax-reliance factors of the <em>Fox </em>test. Consequently, \u201c[a]n entity organized for rendering service to residents of the community and supported by public taxation is a public institution.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Freedom Communications, Inc. v. Elida Community Fire Co. </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 578, 579, 697 N.E.2d 210, citing <em>Fox, </em>39 Ohio St.3d at 110, 529 N.E.2d 443.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>VI. Functional-Equivalency Test</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">{\u00b6 21} In the absence of a precise legislative definition of what constitutes an agency or public office for purposes of public-records acts, some jurisdictions have developed a functional-equivalency test to determine whether particular entities are subject to public-records acts. See <em>Connecticut Humane Soc. v. Freedom of Information Comm. </em>(1991), 218 Conn. 757, 759-760, 591 A.2d 395 (\u201cwhere it is unclear whether a hybrid public/private entity falls within the definition [of \u2018public agency\u2019], we have interpreted the section to include within its scope an entity that is the functional equivalent of a public agency\u201d); <em>Burlington v. Hosp. Adm. Dist. No. 1 </em>(2001), 2001 Me. 59, 769 A.2d 857, \u00b6 16 (\u201cWhen determining whether an entity is a public agency or body for purposes of public disclosure laws, other jurisdictions have looked to the function that the entity performs\u201d); <em>Marks v. McKenzie High School Fact-Finding Team </em>(1994), 319 Ore. 451, 463, 878 P.2d 417 (\u201cfor purposes of construing Oregon\u2019s operative term [ \u2014 \u201cpublic body\u201d for purposes of the public-records law \u2014 ] the legislature would have intended this court to apply a \u2018functional\u2019 approach similar to that taken by the federal courts and by the courts of many of our sister states\u201d); <em>Memphis Publishing Co. v. Cherokee Children &amp; Family Servs. </em>(Tenn.2002), 87 S.W.3d 67, 79 (\u201cwe follow the Connecticut Supreme Court and interpret records \u2018made or received * * * in connection with the transaction of official business by any governmental agency\u2019 to include those records in the hands of any private entity which operates as the functional equivalent of a governmental agency\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">{\u00b6 22} In determining whether a private entity is the functional equivalent of a governmental agency, courts have considered the following nonexhaustive list of factors: (1) whether the entity performs a governmental function, (2) the level of government funding, (3) the extent of government involvement or regulation, and (4) whether the entity was created by the government. See, generally, 1 O\u2019Reilly, Federal Information Disclosure (3d Ed.2000) 68-69, Section 4:11; <em>Connecticut Humane Soc., </em>218 Conn, at 760, 591 A.2d 395; <em>Burlington, </em>2001 Me. 59, 769 A.2d 857, \u00b6 16; <em>Memphis Publishing, </em>87 S.W.3d at 79. At least one court has factored in whether the entity\u2019s officers and employees are government officials or government employees. <em>Marks, </em>319 Ore. at 463-464, 878 P.2d 417.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-7\">{\u00b6 23} Applying the functional-equivalency test requires a case-by-case analysis, examining all pertinent factors with no single factor being dispositive. See <em>Ry. Labor Executives Assn. v. Consol. Rail Corp. </em>(D.C.D.C.1984), 580 F.Supp. 777, 778 (\u201cAll relevant factors are to be considered cumulatively, with no single factor being essential or conclusive\u201d); <em>Bd. of Trustees of Woodstock Academy v. Freedom of Information Comm. </em>(1980), 181 Conn. 544, 555-556, 436 A.2d 266 (\u201cA case by case application of the factors noted above is best suited to ensure that the general rule of disclosure underlying the state\u2019s [Freedom of Information <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>Act] is not undermined by nominal appellations which obscure functional realities\u201d); <em>Memphis Publishing, </em>87 S.W.3d at 79 (\u201cIn making this determination [whether a private entity is the functional equivalent of a government agency], we look to the totality of the circumstances in each given case, and no single factor will be dispositive\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">{\u00b6 24} Until today, we have not expressly adopted a functional-equivalency test to determine whether an entity is a public institution and thus a public office subject to R.C. 149.43. But we have considered factors similar to the factors in the functional-equivalency test in making the determination. See, e.g., <em>State ex rel. Toledo Blade Co. v. Univ. of Toledo Found. </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 258, 602 N.E.2d 1159, paragraph one of the syllabus (\u201cA private nonprofit corporation that acts as a major gift-receiving and soliciting arm of a public university and receives support from public taxation is a \u2018public office\u2019 pursuant to R.C. 149.011(A), and is subject to the public records disclosure requirements of R.C. 149.43(B)\u201d); <em>Fostoria Daily Rev., </em>40 Ohio St.3d at 12, 531 N.E.2d 313 (\u201cif we find that a particular hospital is a public hospital, renders a public service to residents, and is supported by public taxation, we must hold that it is a public office required to disclose its public records\u201d); <em>State ex rel. Dist. 1199, Health Care &amp; Social Serv. Union, SEIU, AFL-CIO v. Lawrence Cty. Gen. Hosp. </em>(1998), 83 Ohio St.3d 351, 699 N.E.2d 1281 (finding hospital to be a public office for purposes of R.C. 149.011(A) and 149.43 because it rendered a public service to county residents, it was supported by public taxation, its employees participated in the Public Employees Retirement System, and its trustees were appointed by county officials); <em>Stys, </em>93 Ohio St.3d 438, 755 N.E.2d 874 (finding that Parma Community General Hospital Association, a nonprofit charitable corporation, was not a public office, even though public taxes were used to build and equip the hospital, because its board members were not public officers, the association decided the terms and conditions of employment for hospital staff, and the employees were not covered under the Public Employees Retirement System).</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">{\u00b6 25} Because the functional-equivalency test is consistent with the persuasive authority from federal and state courts and comports with the test that this court created in <em>Fox, </em>39 Ohio St.3d 108, 529 N.E.2d 443, we adopt it. Thus, we hold that in determining whether a private entity is a public institution under R.C. 149.011(A) and thus a public office for purposes of the Public Records Act, R.C. 149.43, a court shall apply the functional-equivalency test. Under this test, the court must analyze all pertinent factors, including (1) whether the entity performs a governmental function, (2) the level of government funding, (3) the extent of government involvement or regulation, and (4) whether the entity was created by the government or to avoid the requirements of the Public Records Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>{\u00b6 26} We further hold that the functional-equivalency analysis begins with the presumption that private entities are not subject to the Public Records Act absent a showing by clear and convincing evidence that the private entity is the functional equivalent of a public office.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">VII. Application of Functional-Equivalency Test to Oriana House</p>\n<p id=\"AWG\">A. Governmental Function</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">{\u00b6 27} Oriana House controls the day-to-day operations of the Summit County CBCF. The CBCF obtains its operating revenues from ODRC, which is the state agency authorized to \u201cmaintain, operate, manage, and govern all state institutions for the custody, control, training, and rehabilitation of persons convicted of crime and sentenced to correctional institutions.\u201d R.C. 5120.05. Oriana House, in operating the Summit County CBCF, maintains custody of and provides training and rehabilitative services to convicted criminals, but Oriana House is not a CBCF.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-7\">{\u00b6 28} The administration of prisons has traditionally been a uniquely governmental function. <em>Oriana House, Inc. v. Montgomery, </em>108 Ohio St.3d 419, 2006-Ohio-1325, 844 N.E.2d 323, \u00b6 15 (\u201cCBCFs are established by the laws of Ohio to exercise a government function: the operation of facilities and programs for criminal offenders\u201d). See <em>Mossman v. Donahey </em>(1976), 46 Ohio St.2d 1, 19-20, 75 O.O.2d 1, 346 N.E.2d 305 (Brown, J., concurring) (\u201ca state activity like the administration of prisons * * * historically has been an exclusive state function under the reserved powers of the Tenth Amendment\u201d). By performing the duties of the Summit County CBCF, Oriana House is performing a historically governmental function.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-8\">B. Level of Government Funding</p>\n<p id=\"b775-9\">{\u00b6 29} The fact that a private entity receives government funds does not convert the entity into a public office for purposes of the Public Records Act. See <em>Freedom Communications, </em>82 Ohio St.3d at 580, 697 N.E.2d 210 (\u201cwe expressly reject respondents\u2019 contention that this result [that the entity in question is a public office for purposes of R.C. 149.43] is tantamount to concluding that <em>all </em>private entities entering into government contracts are public offices whose records are subject to disclosure under R.C. 149.43\u201d (emphasis sic)); <em>Doe v. Adkins </em>(1996), 110 Ohio App.3d 427, 434-435, 674 N.E.2d 731 (court found no support for \u201cthe proposition that a private corporation should be considered a public entity simply because it receives public funding\u201d); <em>Dow v. Caribou Chamber of Commerce &amp; Industry, </em>2005 Me. 113, 884 A.2d 667, \u00b6 15 (\u201cThe fact that an entity receives a substantial amount of governmental funding is also not sufficient to render that entity a public agency. If this were so, any private organization that received grant money, for example, could arguably be deemed a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>public agency\u201d); <em>Irwin Mem. Blood Bank of the San Francisco Med. Soc. v. Am. Natl. Red Cross </em>(C.A.9, 1981), 640 F.2d 1051 (receipt of money from government contracts did not make the Red Cross an agency subject to the Freedom of Information Act, absent substantial federal control or supervision of its operations).</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">{\u00b6 30} The General Assembly requires the disclosure of certain financial records of organizations with government service contracts. R.C. 149.431 provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">{\u00b6 31} \u201c(A) Any governmental entity or agency and any nonprofit corporation or association * * * that enters into a contract or other agreement with the federal government, a unit of state government, or a political subdivision or taxing unit of this state for the provision of services shall keep accurate and complete financial records of any moneys expended in relation to the performance of the services pursuant to such contract or agreement according to generally accepted accounting principles. Such contract or agreement and such financial records shall be deemed to be public records as defined in division (A)(1) of section 149.43 of the Revised Code and are subject to the requirements of division (B) of that section [with certain exceptions].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b776-7\">{\u00b6 32} Although R.C. 149.431 does not \u201cotherwise limit the provisions of [R.C.] 149.43,\u201d it indicates that the General Assembly recognizes that not every entity that provides services under a government contract is a public office for purposes of the Public Records Act. Nevertheless, the level of government funding is a relevant factor in determining whether an entity is a public office for purposes of the Public Records Act. See <em>Freedom Communications, </em>82 Ohio St.3d at 579, 697 N.E.2d 210 (private, nonprofit corporation, Elida Community Fire Company, was found to be a public office in part due to the level of government funding\u2014 almost 97 percent of its funding was from taxes). Oriana House receives 100 percent of the Summit County CBCF\u2019s revenues, and in 2001, approximately 88 percent of Oriana House\u2019s total revenues came from public sources; the level of government funding is therefore significant.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-8\">C. Extent of Government Involvement or Regulation</p>\n<p id=\"b776-9\">{\u00b6 33} There is no evidence here that any government entity controls the day-to-day operations of Oriana House. See <em>Stys, </em>93 Ohio St.3d at 442, 755 N.E.2d 874 (court found that a hospital association was not a public office, in part because \u201cthe cooperating municipalities do not make any of the day-to-day decisions that affect the hospital\u2019s operation\u201d). The record clearly establishes that Oriana House is an independent, private corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>D. Creation of Entity</p>\n<p id=\"AF3\">{\u00b6 34} Oriana House was created as a private, nonprofit corporation. It was not established by a government entity. Further, nothing in the record indicates that Oriana House, which was incorporated prior to the creation of CBCFs, was created as the alter ego of a governmental agency to avoid the requirements of the Public Records Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">E. Weighing of Factors</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">{\u00b6 35} Even construing R.C. 149.43 liberally in favor of broad access, as we must, <em>State ex rel. Plain Dealer Publishing Co. v. Cleveland, </em>106 Ohio St.3d 70, 2005-Ohio-3807, 831 N.E.2d 987, \u00b6 20, we conclude that there is not clear and convincing evidence that Oriana House is a public institution and thus a public office subject to the Public Records Act. Two factors of the functional-equivalency test favor the auditor\u2019s position, and two factors favor Oriana House\u2019s position. The two factors that favor the auditor\u2019s position are not fully in her favor, while the two factors that favor Oriana House are wholly in its favor. After considering the pertinent factors, we conclude that Oriana House is not a public institution.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-7\">{\u00b6 36} A private business does not open its records to public scrutiny merely by performing services on behalf of the state or a municipal government. It ought to be difficult for someone to compel a private entity to adhere to the dictates of the Public Records Act, which was designed by the General Assembly to allow public scrutiny of public offices, not of all entities that receive funds that at one time were controlled by the government. To that end, we adopt the functional-equivalency test as expressed in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-8\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b777-9\">Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Donnell and Lanzinger, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b777-10\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick and O\u2019Connor, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b771-11\">. Montgomery\u2019s counterclaim included requests for records relating to the Seneca County CBCF and Automatic Data Processing, Inc., a company with whom Oriana House contracted to manage its payroll processing for the Summit County and Seneca County CBCFs. Because this appeal involves only those records relating to Oriana House\u2019s operation of the Summit County CBCF, our analysis is similarly limited.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b777-11\">Moyer, C J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A81\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-12\">{\u00b6 37} I respectfully dissent. This case, and many that have come before it, is an example of the difficult position in which courts are placed when legislatures adopt statutes that include words that are critical to the application of the statute, but then fail to define those words.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-13\">{\u00b6 38} Whether a record is a public record depends upon whether the record is kept by a public office. R.C. 149.43(A)(1). \u201cPublic office\u201d is defined to include a number of designated legal entities. R.C. 149.011(A). Included among them are \u201cinstitution[s]\u201d and \u201cpublic institution[s].\u201d Id. The task of determining which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>entities fall into those categories has been left to the courts, and this court has done so on a case-by-case basis. Our long line of cases and the majority opinion in this case should convince the General Assembly that it, rather than this court, should define the terms in a manner that would settle the policy issues that are determined each time a court applies the broad statutory language to the facts in individual cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">{\u00b6 39} The majority has comprehensively reviewed the jurisprudence relating to the issue. In the absence of a more precise legislative definition of what constitutes a public office subject to public records acts, federal and state courts have developed a \u201cfunctional equivalency\u201d analysis to determine whether particular entities are subject to these laws. I do not disagree with the majority\u2019s transformation of the various iterations of the Ohio test into a functional-equivalency test. I strongly disagree with the conclusion of the majority that application of the functional-equivalency test requires us to reverse the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">{\u00b6 40} In the absence of legislative action, the functional-equivalency test is an improvement over the current two- and three-part tests used previously because it provides more detailed guidance for litigants, the public, and the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-7\">{\u00b6 41} In adopting its version of the functional-equivalency test, however, the majority fails to give any guidance as to the appropriate balancing of the different factors. From its application of the test, it appears that the majority believes that in order for an entity to be deemed a public institution under R.C. 149.011(A), all four elements of the functional-equivalency test must support such a conclusion. I disagree with that approach. And others disagree as well. See <em>Marks v. McKenzie High School Fact-Finding Team </em>(1994), 319 Ore. 451, 463, 878 P.2d 417 (\u201cno single factor is either indispensable or dispositive\u201d); <em>Ry. Labor Executives\u2019 Assn. v. Consol. Rail Corp. </em>(D.C.D.C.1984), 580 F.Supp. 777, 778 (\u201cAll relevant factors are to be considered cumulatively, with no single factor being essential or conclusive\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b778-8\">(\u00b6 42} Some courts include additional factors in the functional-equivalency analysis. See <em>Ry. Labor Executives\u2019 Assn., </em>580 F.Supp. at 778-779 (\u201cThe following factors are among those most often cited in this analysis: The performance of governmental functions by the entity, the presence of substantial government control over the entity\u2019s day to day operations, authority of the entity to make and implement decisions, the nature of the government\u2019s financial involvement with the entity, the existence of a federal charter, and the status of the entity\u2019s employees\u201d); <em>Marks, </em>319 Ore. at 463-464, 878 P.2d 417 (adding two factors to the list adopted by the majority herein: \u201cThe scope of the authority granted to and exercised by the entity\u201d and \u201c[t]he status of the entity\u2019s officers and employees\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>{\u00b6 43} I would apply the foregoing analysis of the functional-equivalency test to Oriana House as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">{\u00b6 44} 1. Governmental Function \u2014 Under R.C. 1.05, \u201cimprisonment\u201d means being imprisoned under a sentence imposed for an offense. Oriana House performs the day-to-day operations of the Summit County Community-Based Correctional Facility (\u201cCBCF\u201d) for Summit County. The CBCF receives all of its operating revenues from a state agency, the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction. The statutory purpose of the department is to \u201cmaintain, operate, manage, and govern all state institutions for the custody, control, training, and rehabilitation of persons convicted of crime and sentenced to correctional institutions.\u201d R.C. 5120.05. Oriana House maintains custody of and provides training and rehabilitative services to convicted criminals with public funds that flow from the Department of Rehabilitation and Correction through the Summit County CBCF. There can be no dispute that the administration of prisons has traditionally been a uniquely governmental function. <em>Mossman v. Donahey </em>(1976), 46 Ohio St.2d 1, 19-20, 75 O.O.2d 1, 346 N.E.2d 305; <em>Oriana House, Inc. v. Montgomery, </em>108 Ohio St.3d 419, 2006-Ohio-1325, 844 N.E.2d 323, \u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">{\u00b6 45} 2. Level of Government Funding \u2014 The fact that an entity receives public funds does not necessarily mean that the entity is a public office for purposes of the Public Records Act. <em>State ex rel. Strothers v. Wertheim </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 155, 161, 684 N.E.2d 1239. If the contrary were so, any private organization that receives grant money could arguably be deemed a public office. I would not support such a conclusion, and an affirmance of the court of appeals decision here does not produce such a result. The suggestion by amici that unless the court of appeals decision is reversed, any private contractor receiving funds under contract with a public agency would be deemed a public office is not supported by the opinion of the court of appeals. In fact, under R.C. 149.431, the General Assembly requires a disclosure of only some of the financial records of organizations with government service contracts. R.C. 149.431 provides some indication that the General Assembly recognizes that not all entities providing services under government contracts are public offices for purposes of the Public Records Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-7\">{\u00b6 46} Nevertheless, the level of government funding is a relevant factor, and in my view, it should be given more weight than other factors. Oriana House received 100 percent of the Summit County CBCF\u2019s revenues \u2014 which are all public funds. Eighty-eight percent of Oriana House\u2019s total revenues came from public sources. That fact, together with the fact that Oriana House was serving a traditional government function, should be enough to at least permit the State Auditor access to the records of all expenditures of the state funds received by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>Oriana House. Oriana House could, of course, seek protection of any records pertaining to use of funds obtained exclusively from private sources.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">{\u00b6 47} Under the majority holding, some of the records of Oriana House are closed to the State Auditor, even though the pages of those records would reveal the manner in which a substantial amount of public funds were expended. A private entity that receives 88 percent of its funding from public sources should not be permitted to keep the public, which provided most of its total revenue, from knowing how those funds were spent.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">{\u00b6 48} 3. Extent of Government Involvement or Regulation- \u2014 -There is no evidence here that any government entity controls the day-to-day operations of Oriana House. However, there is evidence that there was such lack of control on the part of the Summit County Judicial Corrections Board that Oriana House essentially acted as the Summit County CBCF. The president and chief executive officer of Oriana House acted in a dual capacity \u2014 he was also the director of the Summit County CBCF. He signed the Summit County CBCF grant application for fiscal years 2002 and 2003 and received the notification from the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction of its approval of the grant. The Summit County Judicial Corrections Board permitted Oriana House to operate the CBCF without any rules. These facts distinguish this case from previous cases in which we determined that the private entity in question was not a public office. For example, in <em>State ex rel. Stys v. Parma Community Gen. Hosp. </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 438, 755 N.E.2d 874, Parma Hospital was operated by an 18-member board of trustees composed of residents from all of the cooperating municipalities. Id. at 441, 755 N.E.2d 874. The members of the board that operated the hospital were not officers in any of the cooperating municipalities, and that board decided the terms and conditions of employment for hospital staff. Id. Parma Hospital clearly was operated by an independent, private entity.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-7\">{\u00b6 49} As an institution that receives prisoners in the Ohio penal system, Oriana House certainly was required to meet the standards that were created by the Department of Rehabilitation and Correction. R.C. Chapter 5149 and Ohio Adm.Code Chapter 5120.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-8\">{\u00b6 50} 4. Whether the Entity was Created by the Government \u2014 Oriana House was created as a private, nonprofit corporation. I would give that factor very little weight in the context of this case. Surely even the majority would not hold that a private entity that receives all of its funds from public sources is not a public office. Again, the focus of the test should be upon the importance of public funds to the purposes and work of the private entity. Although not suggested here, we should not permit private entities to be created to perform traditional government functions and then permit them to keep from public view the expenditures of public funds.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b781-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>Benesch, Friedlander, Copian &amp; Aronoff, L.L.P., Orla E.

Oriana House performs all of the duties of the Summit County CBCF, a public office, in return for all of the revenues provided by the Department of Rehabilitation and Correction for the CBCF. Oriana House performs these historically governmental functions with seemingly no oversight by the Summit County Judicial Corrections Board and while its president simultaneously performed the role of director of the CBCF during much of the time in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">{\u00b6 52} Under these circumstances, and given our duty to resolve any doubts. regarding the public status of an entity so as to find it subject to R.C. 149.43, Oriana House acts as the functional equivalent of a public office.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">{\u00b6 53} I agree with the observation of the Tennessee Supreme Court in <em>Memphis Publishing Co. v. Cherokee Children &amp; Family Servs., Inc. </em>(2002), 87 S.W.3d 67, 79: \u201cA private business does not open its records to public scrutiny merely by doing business with, or performing services on behalf of, state or municipal government. But when an entity assumes responsibility for providing public functions to such an extent that it becomes the functional equivalent of a governmental agency, the * * * Public Records Act guarantees that the entity is held accountable to the public for its performance of those functions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b781-7\">{\u00b6 54} The court of appeals correctly held that Oriana House is a public office subject to the Public Records Act, and its judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b781-8\">Resnick and O\u2019Connor, JJ., concur in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n<attorneys id=\"b782-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>Bricker &amp; Eckler, L.L.P., and Quint\u00edn F.
