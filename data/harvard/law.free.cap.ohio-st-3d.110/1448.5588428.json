VIII(7)(F), the respondent shall reimburse that amount to the Clients\u2019 Security Fund within 90 days of the notice of such award.</p>\n<p id=\"Af90\">It is further ordered, sua sponte, that all documents filed with this court in this ease shall meet the filing requirements set forth in the Rules of Practice of the Supreme Court of Ohio, including requirements as to form, number, and timeliness of filings.</p>\n<p id=\"ApjZ\">It is further ordered that the clerk of this court issue certified copies of this order as provided for in Gov.Bar R.
