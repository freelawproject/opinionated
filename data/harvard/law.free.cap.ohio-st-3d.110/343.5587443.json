The common pleas court sentenced Sawyer to a prison term of seven years on the conviction of corrupting another with drugs and to a concurrent prison term of four years on the felony conviction for child endangering. On appeal, the court of appeals affirmed Sawyer\u2019s conviction and sentence for corrupting another with drugs but reversed the felony child-endangering conviction. The court of appeals remanded with instructions for the common pleas court to revise that conviction to misdemeanor child endangering and to resentence Sawyer on that charge. <em>State v. Sawyer, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 81133, 2003-Ohio-1720, 2003 WL 1772646.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-13\">{\u00b6 3} On November 15, 2002, Sawyer filed a petition for postconviction relief and a Crim.R. 33(B) \u201cmotion for [a] court order finding that he was unavoidably prevented from discovery [of] evidence.\u201d Sawyer claimed that the new evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>was his daughter\u2019s recantation of her testimony against him. The common pleas court dismissed the petition, and in 'March 2004, the court also denied Sawyer\u2019s Crim.R. 33(B) motion. On appeal, the court of appeals affirmed the denial of Sawyer\u2019s Crim.R. 33(B) motion. <em>State v. Sawyer, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 84487, 2004-Ohio-6911, 2004 WL 2931003. We did not accept Sawyer\u2019s discretionary appeal. 105 Ohio St.3d 1472, 2005-Ohio-1186, 824 N.E.2d 542.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">{\u00b6 4} On January 11, 2005, Sawyer filed another Crim.R. 33(B) \u201cmotion for court order finding that he was unavoidably prevented from discovery of evidence.\u201d Sawyer attached his daughter\u2019s affidavit previously filed with his first motion as well as his daughter\u2019s probation records indicating that certain of her urine-test results during the pertinent period were negative. Sawyer also alleged in his motion that he had attempted to obtain the results of his own urine tests from appellee, Cuyahoga County Department of Children and Family Services (\u201cCCDCFS\u201d), but that he had received no response. The common pleas court denied the motion, and the court of appeals affirmed. <em>State v. Sawyer, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 85911, 2005-Ohio-6486, 2005 WL 3315021. We did not accept Sawyer\u2019s discretionary appeal. 109 Ohio St.3d 1407, 2006-Ohio-1703, 845 N.E.2d 523.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">{\u00b6 5} On May 24, 2005, Sawy\u00e9r filed a petition in the Court of Appeals for Cuyahoga County for a writ of mandamus to compel CCDCFS to provide access to the urine-test results that the agency had requested that he submit in 2001. Sawyer sought the records pursuant to R.C. 149.43, the Public Records Act. He claimed that he needed the test results to support his then pending discretionary appeal from the court of appeals\u2019 affirmance of the trial court\u2019s denial of his second postconviction motion for a court order finding that he was unavoidably prevented from discovering evidence. CCDCFS filed a motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">{\u00b6 6} On September 9, 2005, Sawyer filed a motion for an enlargement of time pursuant to Civ.R. 56(F) and Civ.R. 6(B) to respond to the summary-judgment motion \u201cto permit discovery to be had between the parties\u201d and requesting that \u201csuch enlargement of time begin only after discovery * * * is completed.\u201d On September 29, 2005, the court of appeals granted Sawyer an extension until October 11, 2005, to respond to CCDCFS\u2019s motion. Sawyer did not file a timely response to that motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-8\">{\u00b6 7} On January 25, 2006, the court of appeals granted CCDCFS\u2019s motion and denied the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-9\">{\u00b6 8} In his appeal as of right, Sawyer asserts that the court of appeals abused its discretion when it did not fully grant his motion for an extension of time to respond to CCDCFS\u2019s summary-judgment motion so that he could have sufficient discovery.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b657-10\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>Eugene Sawyer, pro se.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b657-11\">William D. Mason, Cuyahoga County Prosecuting Attorney, and Jon W. Oebker, Assistant Prosecuting Attorney, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b657-4\">{\u00b6 9} \u201c \u2018The standard of review of a trial court\u2019s decision in a discovery matter is whether the court abused its discretion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Maschari v. Tone, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 411, 2004-Ohio-5342, 816 N.E.2d 579, \u00b6 18, quoting <em>State ex rel. Denton v. Bedinghaus, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 298, 2003-Ohio-861, 784 N.E.2d 99, \u00b6 31. See, also, <em>Davis v. Immediate Med. Servs., Inc. </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 10, 14, 684 N.E.2d 292 (applying same standard for reviewing trial court ruling on motion for extension of time under Civ.R. 6). \u201c \u2018An abuse of discretion connotes an unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable attitude.\u2019 \u201d <em>State ex rel. Stewart v. State Emp. Relations Bd., </em>108 Ohio St.3d 203, 2006-Ohio-661, 842 N.E.2d 505, \u00b6 10, quoting <em>State ex rel. Grady v. State Emp. Relations Bd. </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 181, 183, 677 N.E.2d 343.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">{\u00b6 10} The court of appeals did not act in an unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable manner in not fully granting Sawyer\u2019s motion for extension of time. CCDCFS\u2019s motion for summary judgment raised purely legal arguments, and no affidavits were filed supporting the motion. Additional discovery was unnecessary to resolve those legal issues. We reached a similar conclusion in <em>Denton, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 298, 2003-Ohio-861, 784 N.E.2d 99, in which we emphasized, in upholding the denial of a Civ.R. 56(F) motion for continuance to conduct further discovery to respond to a motion for summary judgment, that \u201cadditional discovery was unnecessary to resolve the pertinent issues raised in appellees\u2019 motions for summary judgment.\u201d <em>Denton </em>at \u00b6 32. The court of appeals did not abuse its discretion in denying in part Sawyer\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">{\u00b6 11} Moreover, as the court of appeals correctly held, \u201c[a] defendant in a criminal case who has exhausted the direct appeals of her or his conviction may not avail herself or himself of R.C. 149.43 to support a petition for postconviction relief.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Steckman v. Jackson </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 420, 639 N.E.2d 83, paragraph six of the syllabus; <em>State ex rel. Sevayega v. Reis </em>(2000), 88 Ohio St.3d 458, 459, 727 N.E.2d 910. Similarly, Sawyer could not use R.C. 149.43 to support his postconviction motion under Crim.R. 33(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">{\u00b6 12} Based on the foregoing, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals denying the requested writ of mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b657-9\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell and Lanzinger, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
