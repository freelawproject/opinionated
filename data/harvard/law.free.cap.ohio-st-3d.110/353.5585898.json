In doing so, we must balance two competing interests of great import in American democracy: the individual\u2019s rights in the possession and security of property and the sovereign\u2019s power to take private property for the benefit of the community.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-14\">{\u00b6 2} In case Nos. 2005-0227 and 2005-0228, we determine the constitutionality of the provision in R.C. 163.19 prohibiting a court from enjoining the taking and using of property appropriated by the government and transferred to a private party for redevelopment, after the compensation for the property has been deposited with the court but prior to appellate review of the taking.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-15\">{\u00b6 3} Our consideration does not take place in a vacuum. We recognize that eminent domain engenders great debate.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Its use, though necessary, is fraught with great economic, social, and legal implications for the individual and the community. See, generally, Keasha Broussard, Social Consequences of Eminent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>Domain: Urban Revitalization Against the Backdrop of the Takings Clause (2000), 24 Law &amp; Psychology Rev. 99.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">{\u00b6 4} Appropriation cases often represent more than a battle over a plot of cold sod in a farmland pasture or the plat of municipal land on which a building sits. For the individual property owner, the appropriation is not simply the seizure of a house. It is the taking of a home \u2014 the place where ancestors toiled, where families were raised, where memories were made. Fittingly, appropriations are scrutinized by the people and debated in their institutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">{\u00b6 5} In reviewing an appropriation similar to that at issue here, a sharply divided United States Supreme Court recently upheld the taking over a federal Fifth Amendment challenge mounted by individual property owners. <em>Kelo v. New London </em>(2005), 545 U.S. 469, 125 S.Ct. 2655, 162 L.Ed.2d 439. Although it determined that the Federal Constitution did not prohibit the takings, the court acknowledged that property owners might find redress in the states\u2019 courts and legislatures, which remain free to restrict such takings pursuant to state laws and constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">{\u00b6 6} In response to that invitation in <em>Kelo, </em>Ohio\u2019s General Assembly unanimously enacted 2005 Am.Sub.S.B. No. 167. The legislature expressly noted in the Act its belief that as a result of <em>Kelo, </em>\u201cthe interpretation and use of the state\u2019s eminent domain law could be expanded to allow the taking of private property that is not within a blighted area, ultimately resulting in ownership of that property being vested in another private person in violation of Sections 1 and 19 of Article I, Ohio Constitution.\u201d Section 4(A), 2005 Am.Sub.S.B. No. 167. The Act created a task force to study the use and application of eminent domain in Ohio and imposed \u201ca moratorium on any takings of this nature by any public body until further legislative remedies may be considered.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-8\">{\u00b6 7} We now turn to the cases pending before us, which raise social and legal issues similar to those in <em>Kelo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b667-9\">{\u00b6 8} The appellants\u2019 property was appropriated by the city of Norwood after the city determined that the appellants\u2019 neighborhood was a \u201cdeteriorating area,\u201d as that term is defined in the provisions governing appropriations in the Codified Ordinances of the City of Norwood (\u201cNorwood Code\u201d). Although, as we shall discuss below, we have held that a city may take a slum, blighted, or deteriorated property for redevelopment, <em>State ex rel. Bruestle v. Rich </em>(1953), 159 Ohio St. 13, 50 O.O. 6, 110 N.E.2d 778, and suggested that the taking is proper even when the city transfers the appropriated property to a private party for redevelopment, <em>AAAA Ents., Inc. v. River Place Community Urban Redevelopment Corp. </em>(1990), 50 Ohio St.3d 157, 553 N.E.2d 597, we have never been asked whether a city may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>appropriate property that the city determines is in an area that may deteriorate in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">{\u00b6 9} We hoM that although economic factors may be considered in determining whether private property may be appropriated, the fact that the appropriation would provide an economic benefit to the government and community, standing alone, does not satisfy the public-use requirement of Section 19, Article I of the Ohio Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">{\u00b6 10} We also hold that the void-for-vagueness doctrine applies to statutes that regulate the use of eminent-domain powers. Courts shall apply heightened scrutiny when reviewing statutes that regulate the use of eminent-domain powers. Applying that standard, we hold that Norwood\u2019s use of \u201cdeteriorating area\u201d as a standard for appropriation is void for vagueness. We further hold that the use of the term \u201cdeteriorating area\u201d as a standard for a taking is unconstitutional because the term inherently incorporates speculation as to the future condition of the property to be appropriated rather than the condition of the property at the time of the taking.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">{\u00b6 11} Finally, we hold that the provision in R.C. 163.19 that prohibits a court from enjoining the taking and using of property appropriated by the government after the compensation for the property has been deposited with the court but prior to appellate review of the taking violates the separation-of-powers doctrine and is therefore unconstitutional. We further hold that the unconstitutional portion of R.C. 163.19 can be severed from the rest of the statute, and, accordingly, the remainder of the statute remains in effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">I. Relevant Background</p>\n<p id=\"Ab4\">A</p>\n<p id=\"AuR\">\n<em>Norwood and Its Denizens</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Ad-\">{\u00b6 12} The city of Norwood is a modern urban environment. Surrounded by the city of Cincinnati, Norwood was once home to several manufacturing plants and businesses that provided a substantial tax base for the municipality. Despite that industrial component, Norwood was, and for many remains, a desirable place to live. Norwood\u2019s neighborhoods were composed of traditional single-family houses and duplexes that provided homes to generations of families and many individuals.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>{\u00b6 13} Over the past 40 years, however, Norwood underwent many changes. Like many municipalities in Ohio, Norwood\u2019s industrial base eroded, taking with it tax dollars vital to the city. Municipal jobs and many services were eliminated, and the city is millions of dollars in debt. Though the financial outlook of Norwood has been altered greatly over the years, perhaps the most significant change for our purposes here is the physical nature of the city itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">{\u00b6 14} In the 1960s, property was appropriated from the appellants\u2019 neighborhood and used in the construction of a major highway \u2014 Interstate 71 \u2014 through Cincinnati. In the neighborhoods affected, numerous homes were razed and. front yards diminished in order to make way for the access roads and ramps to the highway. The streets became busier, creating safety problems for residents who had to back onto busy roadways from their driveways. Residential roads that once ran between major thoroughfares were bisected by the new highway, creating dead-end streets.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">{\u00b6 15} Over time, businesses arose in places where houses once stood. The neighborhood became less residential and more commercial. Other changes in the neighborhood\u2019s character followed. Traffic increased dramatically due to motorists seeking the highway and businesses in the area. Noise increased, and light pollution became more prevalent.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-8\">{\u00b6 16} The parties vehemently disagree as to the extent to which these changes adversely affected the physical functionality, aesthetic appeal, and quality of living in the neighborhood. There is no disagreement, however, that the property held commercial value and that the proposed plan for development would raise money for the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-9\">{\u00b6 17} A private, limited-liability company, Rookwood Partners, Ltd. (\u201cRook-wood\u201d), entered discussions with Norwood about redeveloping the appellants\u2019 neighborhood. The preliminary plans for the development call for the construction of more than 200 apartments or condominiums and over 500,000 square feet of office and retail space (all of which would be owned by Rookwood), as well as two large public-parking facilities (which would be owned by Norwood) with spaces for more than 2,000 vehicles. The city expects the redeveloped area to result in nearly $2,000,000 in annual revenue for Norwood.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-10\">{\u00b6 18} Norwood, operating with a deficit, was unable to fix the problems or redevelop the appellants\u2019 neighborhood on its own, and thus city council was interested in the project. Discussions between Norwood and Rookwood culminated in a redevelopment contract in which Rookwood agreed to reimburse the city for the expenses of the project, including the costs arising from any need to use eminent domain to appropriate the property necessary for the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-11\">{\u00b6 19} Rookwood preferred that Norwood acquire the property needed for the project through eminent domain, but Norwood resisted. It encouraged Rook-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>wood to purchase the property through voluntary sales of homes and businesses, without the city\u2019s intervention.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">{\u00b6 20} Rookwood was largely successful; it secured acquisition agreements from a substantial majority of the owners of the property necessary to complete the project. The appellants, however, refused to sell.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">{\u00b6 21} Because the appellants refused to sell their property, Rookwood asked Norwood to appropriate the appellants\u2019 properties and transfer them to Rook-wood. Rookwood, in turn, agreed to raze the existing structures (including the appellants\u2019 homes), reconfigure the streets, and redevelop the area.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b670-8\">\n<em>The Takings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b670-9\">{\u00b6 22} Pursuant to the Norwood Code, an urban-renewal study must be completed before the city can institute eminent-domain proceedings.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Norwood used funds provided by Rookwood to retain a consulting firm, Kinzelman Kline Grossman (\u201cKKG\u201d), to prepare an urban-renewal study of the appellants\u2019 neighborhood. The study concluded that the construction of 1-71 and ensuing conversion of residential and industrial properties to commercial use had led to significant, negative changes in Norwood. Despite acknowledging that many homes were in fair to good condition, KKG concluded that the neighborhood was a \u201cdeteriorating area\u201d as that term is defined in the Norwood Code.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> KKG <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>further determined that the neighborhood would continue to deteriorate and that there would be \u201ccontinuing piecemeal conversion\u201d of residences to businesses that could be detrimental to the area.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">{\u00b6 23} After public hearings and town meetings were held and the local planning commission recommended approval of the redevelopment plan, Norwood City Council passed a series of ordinances adopting the plan and authorizing the mayor to enter the redevelopment agreement with Rookwood and to appropriate the appellants\u2019 property. The city then filed complaints against the appellants to appropriate their properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">{\u00b6 24} At trial, Norwood relied on the testimony of KKG employees to support its conclusion that the appellants\u2019 neighborhood was deteriorating. KKG employees testified that the neighborhood was not a slum, blighted, or deteriorated area as that term is defined in the Norwood Code. The trial court found that the critical evidence presented by Norwood conflicted as to the conclusions to be drawn about the neighborhood. In her findings of fact, the trial judge noted that although one KKG witness opined that the neighborhood was blighted and in a deteriorating condition, he also admitted that the area was not a deteriorated area as that term is defined by the Norwood Code. The trial judge also found that another KKG witness testified that the neighborhood was neither a slum nor blighted or deteriorated and was not on its way to becoming blighted and that he could not conclude that the neighborhood was conducive to ill health, transmission of disease, or juvenile delinquency and crime, or that it was detrimental to public health, safety, morals or general welfare. He testified that he believed that at best, the neighborhood was deteriorating as a single-family-residence neighborhood and that the quality of life of the neighborhood\u2019s residents was decreasing. The trial judge similarly found that Norwood\u2019s planning director testified only that the neighborhood \u201cprobably would\u201d deteriorate or was in danger of deteriorating into a blighted area.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-8\">{\u00b6 25} After a hearing that lasted several days, the trial court rendered findings of fact and conclusions of law regarding whether the taking was lawful. The court found that KKG\u2019s study of the neighborhood contained numerous flaws and errors. Although the court did not enumerate all of the flaws and errors, it specifically noted that KKG had counted several negative factors twice, erroneously included factors that should not have been considered, and improperly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>conflated the criteria necessary to establish a slum, blighted, or deteriorated area with the mutually exclusive criteria for establishing a deteriorating area. The court found that, despite its errors, KKG\u2019s study was not devoid of reliability and validity and that it complied with the Norwood Code. In rejecting the appellants\u2019 contention that Norwood had not used sound reasoning in determining that their neighborhood was deteriorating, the court determined that certain conditions in the neighborhood were established beyond dispute, including those related to the increase in traffic, diversity of ownership, the safety issues related to dead-end streets and driveways off busy roads, and incompatible land uses. The court then determined the conclusions to be drawn from those conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">{\u00b6 26} Significantly, the court found that Norwood had abused its discretion insofar as it had found that the neighborhood was a \u201cslum, blighted or deteriorated area.\u201d That conclusion was based on the paucity of evidence supporting the necessary finding that a \u201cmajority of structures\u201d in the neighborhood were conducive to ill health and crime, detrimental to the public\u2019s welfare, or otherwise satisfied the criteria of a slum, blighted, or deteriorated area. The court concluded, however, that there was no showing that Norwood had abused its discretion in finding that the neighborhood was a \u201cdeteriorating area.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">{\u00b627} The latter conclusion seems to have been driven by the deferential standard that the trial court believed it was required to use in evaluating Norwood\u2019s conclusion:</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">{\u00b6 28} \u201cThe issue is whether [Norwood] abused its discretion in finding that the area was in danger of deteriorating into a blighted area. The Court does not need to conclude that it would reach the same judgment as Norwood, but only that there was a sound reasoning process and that Council did not abuse its discretion. The Court finds that this is a more difficult issue [than the issue of whether the neighborhood was a slum, blighted, or deteriorated area]. On the one hand, it is undisputed that all the buildings in the area are in good to fair condition, generally well maintained with no tax delinquencies, none were \u2018dilapidated,\u2019 and none were \u2018obsolete.\u2019 The KKG principal responsible for the [Urban-Renewal] Plan concluded that the area was not in danger of deteriorating into a blighted area. He did testify that the area was deteriorating as a single family neighborhood; however, this is not the test. The area must be in danger of deteriorating into a blighted area. On the other hand, it is undisputed that there are safety issues and traffic concerns causing unsafe conditions (especially with dead-end streets with little or no turnaround for emergency vehicles), a predominance of inadequate street layout, faulty lot layout, and diversity of ownership, which in combination are in the City Council\u2019s judgment causing the area to be deteriorating. There was evidence that the conditions could lead to impairment of sound growth, an economic liability and a menace to the public welfare. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>Planning Director for the City testified that the area was in danger of deteriorating into a blighted area. The other KKG witness also testified that the area was in danger of deteriorating into a blighted area.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">\u25a0 {\u00b6 29} <em>\u201cJudicial deference to City Council\u2019s decisions is required because in our system of government, legislatures are better able to assess what public purpose should be advanced by the exercise of eminent domain.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added and footnote deleted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">{\u00b6 30} Having found that the taking was justified because of the deteriorating condition of the neighborhood, the trial court returned the causes (which had been consolidated) to their originally assigned judges to hold trials on the issue of compensation. After the juries rendered their verdicts on the value of appellants\u2019 properties, Norwood deposited with the court the full amount awarded in each valuation action. Norwood obtained the titles to the properties and transferred them to Rookwood, which began demolishing the houses in the neighborhood.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-8\">{\u00b6 31} The trial court refused to enjoin Rookwood from using or damaging the property pending appeal, and a divided court of appeals denied a stay of the trial court\u2019s judgment, finding that R.C. 163.19 prohibited such relief. <em>Norwood v. Horney </em>(Jan. 19, 2005), 1st Dist. No. C-040683; <em>Norwood v. Gamble </em>(Jan. 19, 2005), 1st Dist. No. C-040783. Upon appeal of those rulings, we accepted the causes and issued orders preventing the appellees from destroying or otherwise altering the properties pending our review of the taking. 105 Ohio St.3d 1445, 2005-Ohio-669, 822 N.E.2d 1261; 106 Ohio St.3d 1524, 2005-Ohio-5223, 835 N.E.2d 375; 105 Ohio St.3d 1559, 2005-Ohio-2447, 828 N.E.2d 115.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-9\">{\u00b6 32} With this background in mind, we turn to the law relevant to these cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-10\">II. Constitutional Considerations</p>\n<p id=\"b673-11\">{\u00b6 33} \u2018Wherever there is sovereignty, whether in the old world, where it is held in trust for the people by things called kings, or in this country where the people wear it upon their own shoulders, two great and fundamental rights exist. The right of eminent domain in all the people, and the right of private.property in each. These great rights exist over and above, and independent of all human conventions, written and unwritten.\u201d <em>Proprietors of the Spring Grove Cemetery v. Cincinnati, Hamilton &amp; Dayton RR. Co. </em>(Super.1849), 1 Ohio Dec. Reprint 316, reversed on other grounds (Ohio 1850), 1 Ohio Dec. Reprint 343.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-12\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b673-13\">\n<em>Individual Property Rights</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b673-14\">{\u00b6 34} The rights related to property, i.e., to acquire, use, enjoy, and dispose of property, <em>Buchanan v. Warley </em>(1917), 245 U.S. 60, 74, 38 S.Ct. 16, 62 L.Ed. 149, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>are among the most revered in our law and traditions. Indeed, property rights are integral aspects of our theory of democracy and notions of liberty. See, e.g., Robert Meltz, Dwight H. Merriam, and Richard M. Frank, The Takings Issue: Constitutional Limits on Land Use Control and Environmental Regulation (1999) 10; Bernard H. Siegan, Property and Freedom: The Constitution, the Courts, and Land-Use Regulation (1997) 14-18; The Private Use of Public Power: The Private University and the Power of Eminent Domain (1974), 27 Vand.L.Rev. 681, 683, and fn. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">{\u00b6 35} Believed to be derived fundamentally from a higher authority and natural law, property rights were so sacred that they could not be entrusted lightly to \u201cthe uncertain virtue of those who govern.\u201d <em>Parham v. Justices of Decatur Cty. Inferior Court </em>(Ga.1851), 9 Ga. 341, 348. See, also, <em>Bank of Toledo v. Toledo </em>(1853), 1 Ohio St. 622, 664; <em>Proprietors of Spring Grove, </em>1 Ohio Dec. Reprint 316; Joseph J. Lazzarotti, Public Use or Public Abuse (1999), 68 U.M.K.C.L.Rev. 49, 54; J.A.C. Grant, The \u201cHigher Law\u201d Background of the Law of Eminent Domain (1932), 6 Wisc.L.Rev. 67. As such, property rights were believed to supersede constitutional principles. \u201cTo be * * * protected and * * * secure in the possession of [one\u2019s] property is a right inalienable, a right which a written constitution may recognize or declare, but which existed independently of and before such recognition, and which no government can destroy.\u201d <em>Henry v. Dubuque Pacific RR. Co. </em>(1860), 10 Iowa 540, 543. As Chief Justice Bartley eloquently described more than 150 years ago:</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">{\u00b6 36} \u201cThe right of private property is an <em>original </em>and <em>fundamental </em>right, existing anterior to the formation of the government itself; the civil rights, privileges and immunities authorized by law, are <em>derivative </em>\u2014 mere <em>incidents </em>to the political institutions of the country, conferred with a view to the public welfare, and therefore <em>trusts </em>of civil power, to be exercised for the public benefit. * * * Government is the necessary burden imposed on man as the only means of securing the protection of his rights. And this protection \u2014 the primary and only legitimate purpose of civil government, is accomplished by protecting man in his rights of personal security, personal liberty, and private property. The right of private property being, therefore, an <em>original right, </em>which it was one of the primary and most sacred objects of government to secure and protect, is widely and essentially distinguished in its nature, from those exclusive political rights and special privileges * * * which are created by law and conferred upon a few * * *. The fundamental principles set forth in the bill of rights in our constitution, declaring the inviolability of private property, * * * were evidently designed to protect the right of private property as one of the primary and original objects of civil society * * (Emphasis sic.) <em>Bank of Toledo, </em>1 Ohio St. at 632.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>{\u00b6 37} In light of these Lockean notions of property rights, see, e.g., Richard A. Epstein, Takings: Private Property and the Power of Eminent Domain (1985) 10-18, it is not surprising that the founders of our state expressly incorporated individual property rights into the Ohio Constitution in terms that reinforced the sacrosanct nature of the individual\u2019s \u201cinalienable\u201d property rights, Section 1, Article I,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> which are to be held forever \u201cinviolate.\u201d Section 19, Article I. See, also, Section 5, Article XIII; Sections 4, 10, and 11, Article XVIII (requiring compensation for municipal appropriations of private property for public rights of way, utilities, and improvements).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">{\u00b6 38} Ohio has always considered the right of property to be a fundamental right. See, e.g., <em>Reece v. Kyle </em>(1892), 49 Ohio St. 475, 484, 31 N.E. 747, overruled in part on other grounds, <em>Mahoning Cty. Bar Assn. v. Ruffalo </em>(1964), 176 Ohio St. 263, 27 O.O.2d 161, 199 N.E.2d 396; <em>Hatch v. Buckeye State Bldg. &amp; Loan Co. </em>(P.C.1934), 32 Ohio N.P. (N.S.) 297, 16 Ohio Law Abs. 661; <em>In re Vine St. Congregational Church </em>(C.P.1910), 20 Ohio Dec. 573; <em>Caldwell v. Baltimore &amp; Ohio Ry.

There can be no doubt that the bundle of venerable rights associated with property is strongly protected in the Ohio Constitution and must be trod upon lightly, no matter how great the weight of other forces.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">\n<em>The State\u2019s Power of Eminent Domain</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b675-8\">{\u00b6 39} Like the individual\u2019s right to property, the state\u2019s great power to seize private property predates modern constitutional principles. Understood as \u201cthe offspring of political necessity,\u201d <em>Kohl v. United States </em>(1875), 91 U.S. 367, 371, 23 L.Ed. 449, eminent domain is, like the taxation and police powers, <em>Kimball v. Grantsville City </em>(1899), 19 Utah 368, 57 P. 1, 2, \u201can inseparable incident of sovereignty,\u201d <em>Giesy v. Cincinnati, Wilmington &amp; Zanesville RR.

Williams </em>(1831), 4 Ohio 253, 287 (\u201cby virtue of its transcendent sovereignty <em>(dominium eminens), </em>[the state has] a power to appropriate private property for public uses, for the purpose of promoting the general welfare. This power is inherent in every government\u201d). At the time the Constitution was adopted, eminent domain was so familiar that \u201c[i]ts existence * * * in the grantee of that power [was] not to be questioned.\u201d <em>Kohl, </em>91 U.S. at 372, 23 L.Ed. 449. The founders recognized the necessity of the takings power and expressly incorporated it into the Fifth Amendment to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>United States Constitution. But though its existence is undeniable and its powers are sweepingly broad, the power is not unlimited.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">{\u00b640} There is an inherent tension between the individual\u2019s right to possess and preserve property and the state\u2019s competing interests in taking it for the communal good. Mindful of that friction and the potential for misuse of the eminent-domain power, James Madison\u2019s proposed draft of the Takings Clause included two equitable limitations on its use that were eventually incorporated into the Fifth Amendment:<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the \u201cpublic use\u201d requirement and the \u201cjust compensation\u201d rule. Charles E. Cohen, Eminent Domain after <em>Kelo v. City of New London: </em>An Argument for Banning Economic Development Takings (2006), 29 Harv.J.L. &amp; Pub. Policy 491, 532; William B. Stoebuck, A General Theory of Eminent Domain (1972), 47 Wash.L.Rev. 553, 595. The amendment confirms the sovereign\u2019s authority to take, but conditions the exercise of that authority upon satisfaction of two conjunctive standards: that the taking is for a \u201cpublic use\u201d and that \u201cjust compensation\u201d for the taking is given to the property owner. <em>Kelo, </em>545 U.S. 469, 125 S.Ct. at 2672, 162 L.Ed.2d 439; <em>Brown v. Legal Found. of Washington </em>(2003), 538 U.S. 216, 231-232, 123 S.Ct. 1406, 155 L.E.2d 376.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">{\u00b6 41} Similarly, almost every state constitution eventually included provisions related to eminent-domain powers. Stoebuck, 47 Wash.L.Rev. at 554-555. Both the Northwest Ordinance and the Ohio Constitution<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> recognized the state\u2019s right to take property from an individual, but conditioned the right to take on the equitable considerations of just compensation and public use. <em>State ex rel. Bruestle v. Rich, </em>159 Ohio St. at 25-26, 50 O.O. 6, 110 N.E.2d 778; Lazzarotti, 68 U.M.K.C.L.Rev. at 54 (describing the Northwest Ordinance\u2019s \u201cpre-constitutional codification of the eminent domain power\u201d that included the limitations of public use and compensation). Section 19, Article I requires that the taking be necessary for the common welfare and, to \u201cinsure that principle of natural justice,\u201d that the persons deprived of their property will be compensated for \u201cevery injury resulting from this act,\u201d \u201cevery infringement on their [property] rights,\u201d and \u201cevery injurious interference with the control of their own property.\u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Cooper, </em>4 Ohio at 286 and 287.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>{\u00b6 42} The binary constitutional inquiry in an eminent-domain case is whether both the compensation requirement and the public-use tests were satisfied. The issue of compensation is not presented in these appeals, but the latter, more difficult question of \u201cpublic use\u201d is. See <em>Kelo, </em>545 U.S. 469, 125 S.Ct. at 2673, 162 L.Ed.2d 439 (O\u2019Connor, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">{\u00b6 43} It is axiomatic that the federal and Ohio constitutions forbid the state to take private property for the sole benefit of a private individual, <em>O\u2019Neil v. Summit Cty. Bd. of Commrs. </em>(1965), 3 Ohio St.2d 53, 57, 32 O.O.2d 42, 209 N.E.2d 393; <em>Vanhorne\u2019s Lessee v. Dorrance </em>(1795), 2 U.S. (2 Dall.) 304, 1 L.Ed. 391, even when just compensation for the taking is provided. <em>Kelo, </em>545 U.S. 469, 125 S.Ct. at 2661, 162 L.Ed.2d 439 (\u201cit has long been accepted that the sovereign may not take the property of <em>A </em>for the sole purpose of transferring it to another private party <em>B, </em>even though <em>A </em>is paid just compensation\u201d). See, also, <em>Prestonia Area Neighborhood Assn. v. Abramson </em>(Ky.1990), 797 S.W.2d 708, 711 (naked and unconditional government seizure of private property for private use is repugnant to our constitutional protections against the exercise of arbitrary power and fundamental unfairness). A sine qua non of eminent domain in Ohio is the understanding that the sovereign may use its appropriation powers only upon necessity for the common good. <em>Buckingham v. Smith </em>(1840), 10 Ohio 288, 297 (eminent domain \u201cis founded on the superior claims of a whole community over an individual citizen; but then in those cases only where private property is wanted for <em>public use, </em>or demanded by the <em>public welfare \u201d </em>[emphasis sic]). As we explained in <em>Cooper, </em>the exercise of sovereignty in eminent-domain cases is predicated on the notion that such a taking can be permitted only \u201cfor the use and benefit of the people,\u201d which is \u201cdistinct from government interest, profit, or concern.\u201d <em>Cooper, 4 </em>Ohio at 290. \u201cIt is only this great and common benefit to all the people alike that creates a necessity authorizing and justifying the seizure * * *. It is the people\u2019s prerogative, exists in the social compact, and is founded in the maxim, <em>\u2018salus populi suprema est lex.\u2019 \u201d </em>Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">{\u00b6 44} Despite such commanding language, however, the concept of public use has been malleable and elusive. As eminent-domain doctrine developed over the years, understanding of the term \u201cpublic use\u201d often varied greatly, leaving case law in \u201c \u2018doctrinal and conceptual disarray\u2019 \u201d and causing uncertainty for attorneys and jurists. Meltz et al., The Takings Issue, supra, at 8, quoting Andrea Peterson, The Takings Clause: In Search of Underlying Principles: Part I \u2014 A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>Critique of Current Takings Law Doctrine (1989), 77 Cal.L.Rev. 1299, 1304; <em>Nollan v. California Coastal Comm. </em>(1987), 483 U.S. 825, 866, 107 S.Ct. 3141, 97 L.Ed.2d 677 (Stevens, J., dissenting). Given its fluid nature, it is necessary to consider the evolution of the public-use determinations that dominate the instant cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">{\u00b6 45} In America\u2019s nascent period, there was an abundance of unclaimed land, limited government activity, and little controversy over the use of eminent domain to develop land and natural resources. The Public Use Limitation on Eminent Domain: An Advance Requiem (1949), 58 Yale L.J. 599, 600; Philip Nichols Jr., The Meaning of Public Use in the Law of Eminent Domain (1940), 20 B.U.L.Rev. 615, 617. Id. When takings occurred, they were rarely believed to be unwarranted. Typically, the appropriation was of obvious necessity and had-clear, palpable benefits to the public, as in cases in which the property was taken for roadways and navigable canals, government buildings, or other uses related to the protection and defense of the people. See, e.g., <em>Cooper, </em>4 Ohio at 286-287; <em>Ferris v. Bramble </em>(1855), 5 Ohio St. 109, 113; <em>Rindge Co. v. Los Angeles Cty. </em>(1923), 262 U.S. 700, 43 S.Ct. 689, 67 L.Ed. 1186; <em>Kohl, </em>91 U.S. at 368, 23 L.Ed. 449; Nichols, 20 B.U.L.Rev. at 617, and cases cited therein. In this early period, \u201cpublic use\u201d was often equated to \u201cpublic benefit.\u201d See, e.g., <em>McQuillen v. Hatton </em>(1884), 42 Ohio St. 202; Nichols at 617.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">{\u00b6 46} The early legal authority for the rare challenge to such takings was also circumscribed. Before the Civil War and the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, the federal courts held the Fifth Amendment inapplicable to the states. See, e.g., <em>Barron v. Mayor &amp; Baltimore City Council </em>(1833), 32 U.S. (7 Pet.) 243, 250-251, 8 L.Ed. 672 (refusing to impose the Fifth Amendment\u2019s limitations on eminent domain on the states). Thus, the federal courts did not restrain the states\u2019 exercise of eminent-domain powers to take private property.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">{\u00b6 47} Although the takings were occasionally challenged in state courts, only in rare instances did the courts interfere. See, e.g., <em>Buckingham, </em>10 Ohio at 296-297 (limiting the taking of land to what was necessary to accomplish the public benefit). Generally, the state courts upheld the authority for the taking. Nichols, 20 B.U.L.Rev. at 617 and fn. 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-8\">' {\u00b6 48} As America shifted from an agrarian society to an industrialized and increasingly urban one, the economy grew. Social policy and legal philosophy fed more probing inquiries into the nature, scope, and application of all of the sovereign powers, including eminent domain. The takings doctrine was used <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>widely to support the creation of the nation\u2019s physical infrastructure and those enterprises necessary for continued expansion and development, such as utilities, railroads, and mines. Though these takings often involved a significant benefit to individuals and individual corporations, many legislatures and courts affirmed their use under the principle that they afforded some larger, general benefit to the public. Wendell E. Pritchett, The \u201cPublic Menace\u201d of Blight: Urban Renewal and the Private Uses of Eminent Domain (2003), 21 Yale L. &amp; Policy Rev. 1, 9-10; The Private Use of Public Power, 27 Vand.L.Rev. at 702.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-4\">{\u00b6 49} By the mid-19th century, there was some movement within the state courts to limit broad interpretations of public benefit and to more strongly guard individual property rights. See, e.g., <em>Pittsburg, Wheeling &amp; Kentucky RR. Co. v. Benwood Iron-Works </em>(1888), 31 W.Va. 710, 735, 8 S.E. 453 (\u201cWe would do nothing to hinder the development of the state, nor to cripple railroad companies in assisting such development, but at the same time we must protect the property rights of the citizens. All that to which the corporations are entitled under a proper construction of the law they will receive; but they must not, for their own gain and profit, be permitted to take private property for private use\u201d); see, also, <em>Townsend v. Epstein </em>(1901), 93 Md. 537, 49 A. 629. This retrenchment from former broad readings often required creative evasion of precedent, recasting the takings as an exercise of the police power not related to eminent domain. The Public Use Limitation on Eminent Domain, 58 Yale L.J. at 605; Nichols, 20 B.U.L.Rev. at 617-624.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">{\u00b6 50} By the end of the 19th century, the federal courts had established that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment endowed them with authority to review state takings, see, e.g., <em>Missouri Pacific Ry. Co. v. Nebraska </em>(1896), 164 U.S. 403, 417, 17 S.Ct. 130, 41 L.Ed. 489, but they employed broad constructions of \u201cpublic use\u201d in doing so, particularly when the taking expanded the economy or provided vital resources, as with mining operations or irrigation systems necessary for settlement and development of the western regions. Nichols, 20 B.U.L.Rev. at 623. See, e.g., <em>Strickley v. Highland Boy Gold Mining Co. </em>(1906), 200 U.S. 527, 26 S.Ct. 301, 50 L.Ed. 581 (affirming use of eminent domain to permit a private mining company to run lines for transporting ore over private property); <em>Clark v. Nash </em>(1905), 198 U.S. 361, 25 S.Ct. 676, 49 L.Ed. 1085 (affirming use of eminent domain to grant a right of way over private land for the enlargement of an irrigation ditch for the benefit of another private individual).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">{\u00b6 51} The broader concept of public use set forth in these cases eventually dominated and became entrenched in early 20th-century eminent-domain jurisprudence. In this view, the fact that an \u201cincidental benefit\u201d flowed to a private actor was not a critical aspect of the analysis (even if that benefit was significant), provided that there was a clear public benefit in the taking. See Nichols, 20 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>B.U.L.Rev. at 622 and fns. 41-43, citing <em>Old Dominion Land Co. v. United States </em>(1925), 269 U.S. 55, 66, 46 S.Ct. 39, 70 L.Ed. 162; <em>Alabama Power Co. v. Gulf Power Co. </em>(M.D.Ala.1922), 283 F. 606; <em>In re Condemnations for Improvement of Rouge River </em>(E.D.Mich.1920), 266 F. 105. The expansive reading of public use, however, must be understood properly.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">{\u00b6 52} Central to the broad construction of public use was the courts\u2019 understanding that any workable definition of public use in an industrial age had to be \u201ccapable of meeting new conditions and improvements, and the ever-increasing needs of society.\u201d <em>Tanner v. Treasury Tunnel, Mining &amp; Reduction Co. </em>(1906), 35 Colo. 593, 595-596, 83 P. 464, citing <em>Olmstead v. Camp </em>(1866), 33 Conn. 532, 551. Significantly, the more liberal framing of public use was not a retreat from the fundamental understanding that a taking was not warranted for private benefit alone. As Justice Peckham explained in <em>Clark:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">{\u00b6 53} \u201c[W]e do not desire to be understood by this decision as approving of the broad proposition that private property may be taken in all cases where the taking may promote the public interest and tend to develop the natural resources of the state. We simply say that in this particular case, and upon the facts stated in the findings of the court, and having reference to the conditions already stated, we are of the opinion that the use is a public one, although the taking of the right of way is for the purpose simply of thereby obtaining the water for an individual, where it is absolutely necessary to enable him to make any use whatever of his land, and which will be valuable and fertile only if water can be obtained. Other landowners adjoining the [beneficiary of the taking], if any there are, might share in the use of the water by themselves taking the same proceedings to obtain it, and we do not think it necessary, in order to hold the use to be a public one, that all should join in the same proceeding, or that a company should be formed to obtain the water.\u201d 198 U.S. at 369-370, 25 S.Ct. 676, 49 L.Ed. 1085.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">{\u00b6 54} Thus, rather than forging a new notion of public use, <em>Clark </em>is more properly seen as an extension of the court\u2019s decision in <em>Fallbrook Irrigation Dist. v. Bradley </em>(1896), 164 U.S. 112, 17 S.Ct. 56, 41 L.Ed. 369, which found sufficient public use in a taking that granted a private corporation land to create reservoirs and ditches to supply landowners with water.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">{\u00b6 55} The doctrinal evolution of eminent domain thus reflects judicial understandings that the public-use test required flexibility and consideration of diverse local conditions rather that rigid, uniform application. See, e.g., <em>Pontiac Improvement Co. v. Bd. of Commrs. of Cleveland Metro. Park Dist. </em>(1922), 104 Ohio St. 447, 460, 135 N.E. 635; <em>Rindge Co., </em>262 U.S. at 705-706, 43 S.Ct. 689, 67 L.Ed. 1186. See, also, <em>Clark, </em>198 U.S. at 370, 25 S.Ct. 676, 49 L.Ed. 1085 (describing differences in the rights of riparian owners in the eastern and western regions of the country). This acceptance of the need for an elastic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>standard in considering public use became widely ingrained and was fully adopted by this court by midcentury. See, e.g., <em>State ex rel. Gordon v. Rhodes </em>(1951), 156 Ohio St. 81, 91-92, 45 O.O. 93, 100 N.E.2d 225, quoting 37 American Jurisprudence (1941) 734, Municipal Corporations, Section 120 (\u201c \u2018A public use changes with changing conditions of society, new appliances in the sciences, and other changes brought about by an increase in population and by new modes of transportation and communication. The courts as a rule have attempted no judicial definition of a public as distinguished from a private purpose, but have left each case to be determined by its own peculiar circumstances. Generally, a public purpose has for its objective the promotion of the public health, safety, morals, general welfare, security, prosperity, and contentment of all the inhabitants or residents within the municipal corporation, the sovereign powers of which are used to promote such public purpose. * * * The modern trend of decision is to expand and liberally construe the term \u201cpublic use\u201d in considering state and municipal activities\u2019 \u201d); <em>State v. Buckley </em>(1968), 16 Ohio St.2d 128, 132, 45 O.O.2d 469, 243 N.E.2d 66 (\u201cconcepts of police power change with the times\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">{\u00b6 56} While broad conceptualizations of public use evolved during the first decades of the 20th century, civic and government leaders became increasingly concerned with living conditions in urban areas and the array of social problems caused by the lack of adequate and safe, affordable housing in cities. The federal government eventually enacted sweeping legislation in an attempt to ameliorate some of those concerns. See, generally, <em>State ex rel. Ellis v. Sherrill </em>(1940), 136 Ohio St. 328, 331-332, 16 O.O. 464, 25 N.E.2d 844; <em>Sayre v. United States </em>(N.D.Ohio 1967), 282 F.Supp. 175, 187-188 (describing federal urban-renewal funding statutes); <em>State ex rel. Allerton Parking Corp. v. Cleveland </em>(1965), 4 Ohio App.2d 57, 67-68, 33 O.O.2d 91, 211 N.E.2d 203 (noting the adoption of urban-renewal programs by cities across the nation). These modern urban-renewal and redevelopment efforts fostered the convergence of the public-health police power and eminent domain.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">{\u00b6 57} In this paradigm, the concept of public use was altered. Rather than furthering a public benefit by appropriating property to <em>create </em>something needed in a place where it did not exist before, the appropriations power was used to <em>destroy </em>a threat to the public\u2019s general welfare and well-being: slums and blighted or deteriorated property. As set forth in a seminal ease on such actions:</p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">{\u00b6 58} \u201cThe public evils, social and economic, of [unwholesome] conditions [in the slums], are unquestioned and unquestionable. Slum areas are the breeding places of disease which take toll not only from denizens, but, by spread, from the inhabitants of the entire city and state. Juvenile delinquency, crime, and immorality are there born, find protection, and flourish. Enormous economic loss results directly from the necessary expenditure of public funds to maintain health <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>and hospital services for afflicted slum dwellers and to war against crime and immorality. * * * Time and again * * * the use by the Legislature of the power of taxation and of the police power in dealing with the evils of the slums, has been upheld by the courts. Now, in continuation of a battle, which if not entirely lost, is far from won, the Legislature has resorted to the last of the trinity of sovereign powers by giving to a city agency the power of eminent domain.\u201d <em>New York City Hous. Auth. v. Muller </em>(1936), 270 N.Y. 333, 339, 1 N.E.2d 153.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">{\u00b6 59} Historic notions equating physical, moral, and social illnesses with slums and blighted areas were reinforced. The term \u201cblight\u201d itself, borrowed from science and connoting an organism that promotes disease, became synonymous with urban decay, and courts were soon invoking the language of disease. See, e.g., <em>Berman v. Parker </em>(1954), 348 U.S. 26, 34, 75 S.Ct. 98, 99 L.Ed. 27 (\u201cThe experts concluded that if the community were to be healthy, if it were not to revert again to a blighted or slum area, as though possessed of a congenital disease, the area must be planned as a whole\u201d); <em>State ex rel. Ryan v. Gahanna City Council </em>(1984), 9 Ohio St.3d 126, 131, 9 OBR 377, 459 N.E.2d 208 (Locher, J., concurring) (equating \u201curban blight\u201d to \u201cmalignant cancer\u201d); Pritchett, 21 Yale L. &amp; Policy Rev. at 3 (noting the \u201cdisease\u201d rhetoric adopted by renewal advocates); Lawrence M. Friedman, Government and Slum Housing: A Century of Frustration (1968) 169 (noting references to blight as \u201ca disease of urban life\u201d and as a \u201ckind of cancer\u201d). Urban renewal, through the force of eminent domain, became the treatment for saving the body politic from the spread of blight,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> see Pritchett, 21 Yale L. <em>&amp; </em>Policy Rev. at 4, and there was little doubt that a taking of blighted property for purposes of redevelopment was within the broad and inclusive concept of public use. See <em>Berman, </em>348 U.S. at 33, 75 S.Ct. 98, 99 L.Ed. 27; <em>Bruestle, </em>159 Ohio St. 13, 50 O.O. 6, 110 N.E.2d 778, paragraph one of the syllabus; see, also, <em>Kelo, </em>545 U.S. at-, 125 S.Ct. at 2665, 162 L.Ed.2d 439. Almost all courts, including this one, have consistently upheld takings that seized slums and blighted or deteriorated private property for redevelopment, even when the property was then transferred to a private entity, and continue to do so. <em>AAAA Ents., Inc. v. River Place Community Urban Redevelopment Corp., </em>50 Ohio St.3d at 160, 553 N.E.2d 597; <em>Bruestle, </em>159 Ohio St. at 22-24, 50 O.O. 6, 110 N.E.2d 778. These rulings properly employed an elastic public-use analysis to promote eminent domain as an answer to clear and present public-health concerns, permitting razing and \u201cslum clearance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b682-8\">{\u00b6 60} But to some they also signaled an almost unbridled expansion of the notion of public use, which led commentators to suggest that the public-use <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>requirement was dead or dying. See, e.g., The Public Use Limitation on Eminent Domain, 58 Yale L.J. at 600, 605, 613-614; The Private Use of Public Power, 27 Vand.LRev. at 704, fn. 97, and authorities cited therein. Although the death knell has not officially sounded, the modern understanding of public use has permitted somewhat novel findings. See, e.g., <em>Hawaii Hous. Auth. v. Midkiff </em>(1984), 467 U.S. 229, 241-244, 104 S.Ct. 2321, 81 L.Ed.2d 186 (finding sufficient public benefit in the abolition of a land oligopoly to warrant taking private property by eminent domain). In some jurisdictions, a belief has taken hold that general economic development is a public use. See, e.g., <em>Jamestown v. Leevers Supermarkets, Inc. </em>(N.D.1996), 552 N.W.2d 365, 369, and cases cited therein; <em>Poletown Neighborhood Council v. Detroit </em>(1981), 410 Mich. 616, 304 N.W.2d 455, overruled by <em>Wayne Cty. v. Hathcock </em>(2004), 471 Mich. 445, 684 N.W.2d 765; <em>Duluth v. State </em>(Minn.1986), 390 N.W.2d 757, 763-764; <em>Prince George\u2019s Cty. v. Collington Crossroads, Inc. </em>(1975), 275 Md. 171, 191, 339 A.2d 278; Thomas W. Merrill, The Economics of Public Use (1986), 72 Cornell L.Rev. 61. <em>Kelo </em>confirmed this view for purposes of federal constitutional analysis, id., 545 U.S. at-, 125 S.Ct. at 2665, 162 L.Ed.2d 439, despite the fact that many legal commentators have expressed alarm at the potential abuse of the eminent-domain power in such circumstances, see <em>Kelo v. New London </em>(2004), 268 Conn. 1, 132-133, 843 A.2d 500.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">{\u00b6 61} Inherent in many decisions affirming pronouncements that economic development alone is sufficient to satisfy the public-use clause is an artificial judicial deference to the state\u2019s determination that there was sufficient public use. Similarly, in the cases before us, the trial and appellate courts below seem to have been mistaken regarding the scope of review to be employed.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-8\">{\u00b6 62} The trial court properly found an abuse of discretion in Norwood\u2019s finding that the area targeted for redevelopment was a slum or a blighted or deteriorated area. But notwithstanding what seems to have been a significant question about whether the taking of the neighborhood could be based on its designation as a \u201cdeteriorating area,\u201d the trial court appears to have felt constrained by its interpretation of prior cases, stating that judicial review of appropriations is limited and must be deferential to the municipality. In reviewing that decision, the appellate court repeatedly framed its inquiries as whether Norwood abused its discretion by finding that the area was blighted or in danger of deteriorating into a blighted area \u2014 inquiries that it answered negatively after applying broad deference and liberal interpretation to Norwood\u2019s conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-9\">{\u00b6 63} The trial and appellate courts correctly stated that, absent a showing of abuse of discretion, deference was due to the city\u2019s determination that the area was blighted and deteriorated. (And although deference is certainly due to such findings, it is not absolute deference \u2014 as evidenced by the trial judge\u2019s correct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>conclusion that there was an abuse of discretion in the city\u2019s determination in these cases.) But for reasons that we more fully set forth later in our analysis, the courts\u2019 conclusion that eliminating a \u201cdeteriorating area\u201d satisfied the public-use requirement was an erroneous one. We believe that that error occurred, at least in part, because of a misunderstanding of the scope of review to be given in such inquiries.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">{\u00b6 64} The use of \u201cdeteriorating area\u201d as a standard for a taking has never been adopted by this court, but the trial court apparently believed that deference must be given to a city\u2019s conclusion that a taking is proper. In affirming the trial court\u2019s judgment, the appellate court engaged in a limited independent analysis, noting that \u201c[w]here the exercise of eminent domain is rationally related to a conceivable public purpose, the United States Supreme Court has never held a compensated taking to be prohibited by the public-use clause.\u201d 161 Ohio App.3d 316, 2005-Ohio-2448, 830 N.E.2d 381, \u00b6 43, citing <em>Hawaii Hous.

Moreover, the court in <em>Midkijf </em>noted, \u201c[tjhere is, of course, a role for courts to play in reviewing a legislature\u2019s judgment of what constitutes a public use.\u201d 467 U.S. at 240, 104 S.Ct. 2321, 81 L.Ed.2d 186.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">{\u00b6 66} Although there is merit in the notion that deference must be paid to a government\u2019s determination that there is sufficient evidence to support a taking in a case in which the taking is for a use that has previously been determined to be a public use, see <em>Kelo, </em>545 U.S. at-, 125 S.Ct. at 2669, 162 L.Ed.2d 439 (Kennedy, J., concurring) (comparing the deference to rational-basis review in an equal-protection challenge but not foreclosing the possibility that heightened scrutiny might be applied properly in some cases), that deferential review is not satisfied by superficial scrutiny.

Though the Ohio Constitution may bestow on the sovereign a magnificent power to take private property against the will of the individual who owns it, it also confers an \u201cinviolable\u201d right of property on the people. When the state elects to take private property without the owner\u2019s consent, simple justice requires that the state proceed with due concern for the venerable rights it is preempting. <em>Cleveland v. Hurwitz </em>(P.C.1969), 19 Ohio Misc. 184, 192, 48 O.O.2d 384, 249 N.E.2d 562. See, generally, <em>Buchanan, </em>245 U.S. 60, 38 S.Ct. 16, 62 L.Ed. 149; <em>Reckner v.

See, e.g., <em>Pheasant Ridge Assocs. Ltd. Partnership v. Burlington </em>(1987), 399 Mass. 771, 506 N.E.2d 1152; <em>Earth Mgt., Inc. v. Heard Cty. </em>(1981), 248 Ga. 442, 283 S.E.2d 455. In the proper exercise of our duty to ensure that property rights are protected, we have held that the state may not take to secure a financial gain by resale of, or taxation on, appropriated land. <em>Buckingham, </em>10 Ohio at 297 (\u201cthe exercise of such a power would be utterly destructive of individual right, and break down all the distinctions between <em>meum et tuum, </em>and annihilate them forever, at the pleasure of the state\u201d). See, also, <em>Piedmont Triad Regional Water Auth. v. Sumner Hills, Inc. </em>(2001), 353 N.C. 343, 346, 543 S.E.2d 844. Thus, our precedent does not demand rote deference to legislative findings in eminent-domain proceedings, but rather, it preserves the courts\u2019 traditional role as guardian of constitutional rights and limits. Accordingly, \u201cquestions of public <em>purpose </em>aside, whether * * * proposed condemnations [are] consistent with the Constitution\u2019s \u2018public use\u2019 requirement [is] a constitutional question squarely within the Court\u2019s authority.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) <em>Hathcock, </em>471 Mich. at 480, 684 N.W.2d 765. See, also, <em>Cincinnati v.

In deciding such a question, the Court has appropriate regard to the diversity of local conditions and considers with great respect legislative declarations and in particular the judgments of state courts as to the uses considered to be public in light of local exigencies. But the question remains a judicial one which this Court must decide in performing its duty of enforcing the provisions of the Federal Constitution\u201d); <em>Kelo, </em>545 U.S. 469, 125 S.Ct. at 2684, 162 L.Ed.2d 439 (Thomas, J., dissenting) (advocating that no deference should be given to \u201ca legislature\u2019s judgment concerning the quintessentially legal question of whether the government owns, or the public has the right to use, the taken property\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">{\u00b6 70} The scrutiny by the courts in appropriation cases is limited in scope, but it clearly remains a critical constitutional component. The sovereign\u2019s right to take property may be conferred by the legislature on municipalities, which enjoy broad discretion in determining whether a proposed taking serves the public. But it is for the courts to ensure that the legislature\u2019s exercise of power is not beyond the scope of its authority, and that the power is not abused by irregular or oppressive use, or use in bad faith. <em>Pontiac Improvement Co., </em>104 Ohio St. at 458, 135 N.E. 635, citing <em>Giesy, </em>4 Ohio St. at 326. And when the authority is delegated to another, the courts must ensure that the grant of authority is construed strictly and that any doubt over the propriety of the taking is resolved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>in favor of the property owner. Id. at 453-454, 135 N.E. 635. In reviewing an appropriation, we thus act with deference to legislative pronouncements, but we are independent of them. See <em>Hathcock, </em>471 Mich. at 480, 684 N.W.2d 765, quoting Justice Ryan\u2019s dissenting opinion in <em>Poletown Neighborhood Council v.

A primordial purpose of the public-use clause is to prevent the legislature from permitting the state to take private property from one individual simply to give it to another. Such a law would be a flagrant abuse of legislative power, see <em>Calder v. Bull </em>(1798), 3 U.S. (3 Dall.) 386, 388, 1 L.Ed. 648, and to give deference to it would be a wholesale abdication of judicial review. See <em>Kelo, </em>545 U.S. at-, 125 S.Ct. at 2676-2677, 162 L.Ed.2d 439 (O\u2019Connor, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-8\">{\u00b6 73} As Justice O\u2019Connor correctly discerned in her analysis of the taking in <em>Kelo, </em>when the state takes an individual\u2019s property and gives it to another based solely on the economic gain afforded by the transfer, the \u201cprivate benefit and [the] incidental public benefit are, by definition, merged and mutually reinforcing.\u201d 545 U.S. at-, 125 S.Ct. at 2675, 162 L.Ed.2d 439. We agree that due to the mutuality of public and private interests in such cases, a danger exists that the state\u2019s decision to take may be influenced by the financial gains that would flow to it or to the private entity because of the taking \u2014 a danger that is not apparent when the state or its designee determines whether the appropriation is warranted by communal need and public benefit. See <em>Kelo, </em>268 Conn, at 129-130, 843 A.2d 500 (Zarella, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (\u201cBecause public agencies must work hand in glove with private developers to achieve plan objectives, the taking agency may employ the power to favor purely private interests. See, e.g., <em>Southwestern Illinois Development Authority v. National City Environmental, LLC, </em>199 Ill.2d 225, 240-241, 263 Ill.Dec. 241, 768 N.E.2d 1 (taking of property for expansion of private parking facility deemed not for public purpose), cert. denied, 537 U.S. 880, 123 S.Ct. 88, 154 L.Ed.2d 135 (2002). The trial court in the present case recognized this problem when it stated in its memorandum of decision that \u2018powerful business groups or companies [may] exercise their influence to gain their ends with * * * little corresponding benefit to the public.\u2019 The majority makes a similar observation. See part IIA of the majority opinion (recognizing \u2018potential for abuse of the eminent domain power\u2019)\u201d). In such circumstances, both common sense and the law command independent judicial review of the taking. \u201c[T]he mere recitation of a benign * * * purpose is not an automatic shield which protects against any inquiry into the actual purposes underlying a statutory scheme.\u201d See <em>Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld </em>(1975), 420 U.S. 636, 648, 95 S.Ct. 1225, 43 L.Ed.2d 514.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-10\">{\u00b6 74} Given the individual\u2019s fundamental property rights in Ohio, the courts\u2019 role in reviewing eminent-domain appropriations, though limited, is important in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>all cases. Judicial review is even more imperative in cases in which the taking involves an ensuing transfer of the property to a private entity, where a novel theory of public use is asserted, and in cases in which there is a showing of discrimination, bad faith, impermissible financial gain, or other improper purpose. With our proper role as arbiters of the scope of eminent domain clarified, we turn to the public use at issue in these cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">{\u00b6 75} Although we have permitted economic concerns to be considered in addition to other factors, such as slum clearance,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> when determining whether the public-use requirement is sufficient, we have never found economic benefits alone to be a sufficient public use for a valid taking. We decline to do so now.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">{\u00b6 76} Rather, we find that the analysis by the Supreme Court of Michigan in <em>Hathcock, </em>471 Mich. 445, 684 N.W.2d 765, and those presented by the dissenting judges of the Supreme Court of Connecticut and the dissenting justices of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Kelo </em>are better models for interpreting Section 19, Article I of Ohio\u2019s Constitution. In <em>Hathcock, </em>the court overruled its prior holding in <em>Poletown Neighborhood Council v. Detroit, </em>410 Mich. 616, 304 N.W.2d 455, a case that the court characterized as a \u201cradical and unabashed departure\u201d from eminent-domain jurisprudence. 471 Mich. at 480, 684 N.W.2d 765. See, also, Timothy Sandefur, A Gleeful Obituary for Poletown Neighborhood Council v. Detroit (2005), 28 Harvard J.L. &amp; Pub.

To justify the exercise of eminent domain solely on the basis of the fact that the use of that property by a private entity seeking its own profit might contribute to the economy\u2019s health is to render impotent our constitutional limitations on the government\u2019s power of eminent domain. <em>Pole-town\u2019s </em>\u2018economic benefit\u2019 rationale would validate practically <em>any </em>exercise of the power of eminent domain on behalf of a private entity. After all, if one\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>ownership of private property is forever subject to the government\u2019s determination that another private party would put one\u2019s land to better use, then the ownership of real property is perpetually threatened by the expansion plans of any large discount retailer, \u2018megastore,\u2019 or the like. Indeed, it is for precisely this reason that this Court has approved the transfer of condemned property to private entities only when certain other conditions * * * are present.\u201d (Emphasis sic; footnote omitted.) <em>Hathcock, </em>471 Mich, at 482, 684 N.W.2d 765.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">{\u00b6 78} Our understanding of the individual\u2019s fundamental rights in property, as guaranteed by the Ohio Constitution and our consistent holdings throughout the past two centuries that a genuine public use must be present before the state invokes its right to take, is better reflected by Hathcock\u2019s holdings that economic development by itself is not a sufficient public use to satisfy a taking. Although economic benefit can be considered as a factor among others in determining whether there is a sufficient public use and benefit in a taking, it cannot serve as the sole basis for finding such benefit. Id. See, also, <em>Sweetwater Valley Civic Assn. v. Natl.

First, because we assume that man is free to steer between lawful and unlawful conduct, we insist that laws give the person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited, so that he may act accordingly. Vague laws may trap the innocent by not providing fair warning. Second, if arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement is to be prevented, laws must provide explicit standards for those who apply them. A vague law impermissibly delegates basic policy matters to police [officers], judges, and juries for resolution on an ad hoc and subjective basis, with the attendant dangers of arbitrary and discriminatory application.\u201d (Footnotes omitted.) <em>Grayned v.

The determination of whether a statute is impermissibly imprecise, indefinite, or incomprehensible, see <em>Buckley v.

New York </em>(S.D.N.Y.1989), 724 F.Supp. 1142, 1147. Though the degree of review is not described with specificity, regulations that are directed to economic matters and impose only civil penalties are subject to a \u201cless strict vagueness test,\u201d but if the enactment \u201cthreatens to inhibit the exercise of constitutionally protected rights,\u201d a more stringent vagueness test is to be applied. <em>Hoffman Estates, </em>455 U.S. at 498-499, 102 S.Ct. 1186, 71 L.Ed.2d 362.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>{\u00b6 86} In either rubric, however, a statute is not void simply because it could be worded more precisely or with additional certainty. <em>State ex rel. Rear Door Bookstore v. Tenth Dist. Court of Appeals </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 354, 358, 588 N.E.2d 116, citing <em>Roth v. United States </em>(1957), 354 U.S. 476, 77 S.Ct. 1304, 1 L.Ed.2d 1498. The critical question in all cases is whether the law affords a reasonable individual of ordinary intelligence fair notice and sufficient definition and guidance to enable him to conform his conduct to the law; those laws that do not are void for vagueness. <em>Grayned, </em>408 U.S. at 108-109, 92 S.Ct. 2294, 33 L.Ed.2d 222; <em>Papachristou v. Jacksonville </em>(1972), 405 U.S. 156, 92 S.Ct. 839, 31 L.Ed.2d 110.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">{\u00b6 87} The vagueness doctrine is usually applied in criminal law and First Amendment claims, but neither the rationale underlying the doctrine nor the case law interpreting it suggests that it should not be applied in any case in which the statute challenged substantially affects other fundamental constitutional rights. See <em>Jordan v. De George </em>(1951), 341 U.S. 223, 71 S.Ct. 703, 95 L.Ed. 886 (applying the doctrine to a deportation statute); <em>Giaccio, </em>382 U.S. at 402, 86 S.Ct. 518, 15 L.Ed.2d 447. And, of course, the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment demands that fair notice be given to a property owner in an appropriation action. See, e.g., <em>Walker v. Hutchinson </em>(1956), 352 U.S. 112, 115-117, 77 S.Ct. 200, 1 L.Ed.2d 178 (notice by publication held inadequate in appropriation case). See, also, <em>Lambert v. California </em>(1957), 355 U.S. 225, 229, 78 S.Ct. 240, 2 L.Ed.2d 228 (\u201cNotice is required before property interests are disturbed, before assessments are made, before penalties are assessed\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">{\u00b6 88} Given that eminent domain necessarily entails the state\u2019s intrusion onto the individual\u2019s right to garner, possess, and preserve property and that sufficient notice is the critical core of the void-for-vagueness doctrine, the doctrine has utility in eminent-domain cases. We hold that when a court reviews an eminent-domain statute or regulation under the void-for-vagueness doctrine, the court shall use the heightened standard of review employed for a statute or regulation that implicates a First Amendment or other fundamental constitutional right. See <em>Hoffman Estates, </em>455 U.S. at 498-499, 102 S.Ct. 1186, 71 L.Ed.2d 362.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">{\u00b6 89} With the controlling constitutional law established, we turn now to its particular applications in the instant cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-8\">III. Application op the Law to the Facts A</p>\n<p id=\"b692-9\">\n<em>Norwood Code\u2019s Use of \u201cDeteriorating Area\u201d as a Standard for a Taking</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b692-10\">{\u00b6 90} This court has affirmed cases in which a taking of property was upheld upon a showing that the property was a slum, or blighted, or, in effect, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>deteriorated. See, e.g., <em>AAAA Ents., </em>50 Ohio St.3d 157, 553 N.E.2d 597; <em>Bruestle, </em>159 Ohio St. 13, 50 O.O. 6, 110 N.E.2d 778; <em>St. Stephen\u2019s Club v. Youngstown Metro. Hous. Auth. </em>(1953), 160 Ohio St. 194, 52 O.O. 3, 115 N.E.2d 385. But this is the first time that we have reviewed a judgment that condoned the taking of property upon a finding that the property is in an area that is deteriorating. We refuse to affirm it.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">{\u00b6 91} The takings in the instant cases were based solely on a finding that the neighborhood was a deteriorating area. But what notice does the term \u201cdeteriorating area\u201d give to an individual property owner?</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">{\u00b6 92} As defined by the Norwood Code, a \u201cdeteriorating area\u201d is not the same as a \u201cslum or blighted or deteriorated area,\u201d the standard typically employed for a taking. And here, of course, there was no evidence to support a taking under that standard. To the contrary, the buildings in the neighborhood were generally in good condition and the owners were not delinquent in paying property taxes. There is no suggestion that the area was vermin-infested or subject to high crime rates or outbreaks of disease, or otherwise posed an impermissible risk to the larger community.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-8\">{\u00b6 93} The Norwood Code sets forth a fairly comprehensive array of conditions that purport to describe a \u201cdeteriorating area,\u201d including those found by the trial judge in this case: incompatible land uses, nonconforming uses, lack of adequate parking facilities, faulty street arrangement, obsolete platting, and diversity of ownership. In addition, the trial court identified the following factors as supporting the determination that the neighborhood was deteriorating: increased traffic, dead-end streets that impede public-safety vehicles, numerous curb cuts and driveways, and small front yards. But all of those factors exist in virtually every urban American neighborhood.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Because the Norwood Code\u2019s definition of a deteriorating area describes almost any city, it is suspect. See <em>Beach-Courchesne, </em>80 Cal.App.4th at 407, 95 Cal.Rptr.2d 265 (\u201cIf the showing made in [this] case were sufficient to rise to the level of blight, it is the rare locality in California that is not afflicted with that condition\u201d); <em>Birmingham v. Tutwiler Drug Co. </em>(Ala.1985), 475 So.2d 458, 466 (the area alleged to be blighted \u201cwas typical of much of downtown Birmingham\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-9\">{\u00b6 94} Similarly, some of the factors upon which the court relied, such as diversity of ownership, could apply to many neighborhoods. And although the term commonly appears in eminent-domain cases and regulations, it is susceptible of many meanings and to manipulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>{\u00b6 95} Here, the term appears in the Norwood Code but is not defined. The trial court held that the term could mean either \u201cseveral owners of a single property or several owners of different properties\u201d but that the latter definition applied in the instant cases. Other courts seem to have attributed the former meaning to the term. See <em>Beach-Courchesne, </em>80 Cal.App.4th at 405, 95 Cal. Rptr.2d 265 (\u201cThe mere fact of multiple ownership does not establish blight. Otherwise, a condominium development would by definition be blighted\u201d). The ambiguity of the term portends impermissible vagueness because it does not afford fair warning to property owners and permits arbitrary or discriminatory enforcement. See <em>Grayned, </em>408 U.S. at 108-109, 92 S.Ct. 2294, 33 L.Ed.2d 222.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">{\u00b6 96} Moreover, diversity of ownership is a factor of questionable weight. As seems to have been the case here, diversity of ownership is typically considered to be a negative factor for a neighborhood because it purportedly impedes development. Yet Rookwood was able to secure virtually every property owner\u2019s assent to sale without any apparent difficulty. Thus, though diversity of ownership may be a factor to consider in determining whether an area is deteriorated, it is not a compelling one.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">{\u00b6 97} In the cases before us, we cannot say that the appellants had fair notice of what conditions constitute a deteriorating area, even in light of the evidence adduced against them at trial. The evidence is a morass of conflicting opinions on the condition of the neighborhood. Though the Norwood Code\u2019s definition of \u201cdeteriorating area\u201d provides a litany of conditions, it offers so little guidance in application that it is almost barren of any practical meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">{\u00b6 98} In essence, \u201cdeteriorating area\u201d is a standardless standard. Rather than affording fair notice to the property owner, the Norwood Code merely recites a host of subjective factors that invite ad hoc and selective enforcement\u2014 a danger made more real by the malleable nature of the public-benefit requirement. We must be vigilant in ensuring that so great a power as eminent domain, which historically has been used in areas where the most marginalized groups live, is not abused.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-8\">{\u00b6 99} As important, the standard for \u201cdeteriorating area\u201d defined in the Norwood Code is satisfied not just upon a finding that a neighborhood <em>is </em>deteriorating or <em>will </em>deteriorate, but is also satisfied by a finding that it <em>\u201cis in danger of </em>deteriorating into a blighted area.\u201d The statutory definition, therefore, incorporates not only the existing condition of a neighborhood, but also extends to what that neighborhood might become. But what it <em>might </em>become may be no more likely than what <em>might not </em>become. Such a speculative standard is inappropriate in the context of eminent domain, even under the modern, broad interpretation of \u201cpublic use.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b695-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>{\u00b6 100} A municipality has no authority to appropriate private property for only a contemplated or speculative use in the future. See <em>State ex rel. Sun Oil Co. v. Euclid </em>(1955), 164 Ohio St. 265, 271-272, 58 O.O. 25, 130 N.E.2d 336, citing <em>Cincinnati v. Vester, </em>281 U.S. at 448, 50 S.Ct. 360, 74 L.Ed. 950. As we said in O\u2019Neil:</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">{\u00b6 101} \u201cPublic use cannot be determined as of the time of completion of a proposed development, but must be defined in terms of present commitments which in the ordinary course of affairs will be fulfilled.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">{\u00b6 102} \u201c \u2018 * * * If the public use is contingent and prospective and the private use or benefit is actual and present, the public use would be incidental to the private use, and in such a case the power of eminent domain clearly could not lawfully be exercised.\u2019 <em>Kessler v. City of Indianapolis </em>(1927), 199 Ind. 420, 430, 157 N.E. 547, 550, 53 A.L.R. 1.\u201d <em>O\u2019Neil, </em>3 Ohio St.2d at 58, 32 O.O.2d 42, 209 N.E.2d 393.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">{\u00b6 103} A fundamental determination that must be made before permitting the appropriation of a slum or a blighted or deteriorated property for redevelopment is that the property, because of its existing state of disrepair or dangerousness, poses a threat to the public\u2019s health, safety, or general welfare. Although we adhere to a broad construction of \u201cpublic use,\u201d we hold that government does not have the authority to appropriate private property based on mere belief, supposition, or speculation that the property may pose such a threat in the future. <em>O\u2019Neil, </em>supra; <em>Sun Oil Co., </em>supra. See, also, <em>99 Cents Only Stores, </em>237 F.Supp.2d at 1130-1131, and cases cited therein; <em>Merrill v. Manchester, </em>127 N.H. at 238-239, 499 A.2d 216; <em>Baycol, Inc. v. Fort Lauderdale Downtown Dev. Auth., </em>315 So.2d at 457-458. See, also, <em>Grand Rapids Bd. of Edn. v. Baczewski </em>(1954), 340 Mich. 265, 271-272, 65 N.W.2d 810 (invalidating a taking that was based on speculation that a school might be built on the property 30 years in the future). To hold otherwise would permit the derogation of a cherished and venerable individual right based on nothing more than \u201ca plank of hypothesis flung across an abyss of uncertainty.\u201d Edith Wharton, The Descent of Man, 35 Scribner\u2019s Magazine (Mar.1904) 313, 321, reprinted in 1 The Selected Short Stories of Edith Wharton (1991) 49, 62. To permit a taking of private property based solely on a finding that the property is deteriorating or in danger of deteriorating would grant an impermissible, unfettered power to the government to appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-8\">{\u00b6 104} We therefore hold that the use of \u201cdeteriorating area\u201d as a standard for determining whether private property is subject to appropriation is void for vagueness and offends due-process rights because it fails to afford a property owner fair notice and invites subjective interpretation. Further, we hold that the term \u201cdeteriorating area\u201d cannot be used as a standard for a taking, because it inherently incorporates speculation as to the future condition of the property into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>the decision on whether a taking is proper rather than focusing that inquiry on the property\u2019s condition at the time of the proposed taking.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">{\u00b6 105} Because Norwood may not justify'its taking of appellants\u2019 property on either the basis that the neighborhood was deteriorating or on the basis that the redeveloped area would bring economic value to the city, there is no showing that the taking was for public use. Our conclusion is not altered by the amount of compensation offered to the property owners in this case, even if it was in excess of the fair market value of their property. Though the questions of just compensation and public use are both critical in an eminent-domain analysis, they must be assessed and satisfied independently. Here, there is not an adequate showing that the takings were for a public use. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals that affirmed the trial court\u2019s holding that the appropriation of the appellants\u2019 property was permitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">\n<em>Constitutionality of R.C. 163.19</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">{\u00b6 106} We turn now to the constitutionality of R.C. 163.19, one provision of many in R.C. Chapter 163, which governs appropriation actions in Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-8\">{\u00b6 107} R.C. 163.19 provides that if the owner fails to persuade the trial court that the taking is not necessary, \u201cany party may prosecute appeals as in other civil actions from the judgment of the court. The trial court upon proper terms may suspend the execution of any order; <em>but in all cases where the agency pays or deposits the amount of the award assessed and gives adequate security for any further compensation and costs, as required by the court, the right to take and use the property appropriated shall not be affected by such review by the appellate courts.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) We must now determine the effect of the emphasized statutory language on appellate review when the agency has paid the award and has given the required security.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b696-9\">{\u00b6 108} As we explained in <em>Cincinnati Gas &amp; Elec. Co. v. Pope </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 12, 18-19, 8 O.O.3d 7, 374 N.E.2d 406, R.C. 163.19 expresses the legislature\u2019s balancing of vital interests:</p>\n<p id=\"b696-10\">{\u00b6 109} \u201cThe General Assembly has apparently decided that the health, safety and welfare of the general public will be promoted by the speedy construction of necessary public projects. R.C. 163.19 thus appears to be a compromise measure which preserves the property owner\u2019s traditional right to appellate review of the trial court\u2019s findings on the preliminary issues, but which also grants to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>appropriating agency the right to take and use the appropriated property while such appellate review is pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\">{\u00b6 110} \u201c * * * In the majority of appeals in appropriation cases there would be no reason to delay construction of a public project when only the jury award of compensation is contested. In those rare instances where the property owner successfully appeals the preliminary issues of the right to take and the necessity for the take, the title to the property previously conferred upon the appropriating agency, under R.C. 163.15, is thereupon subject to defeasance. Finally, we recognize that because of the balance struck within R.C. 163.19, there is the possibility that the contested property might be damaged by the appropriating agency after it acquires title thereto under R.C. 163.15, only to be later restored, in this damaged condition, to the property owner who successfully appeals the preliminary issues. It is therefore imperative that the property owner who prosecutes an appeal on other than the jury award of compensation adequately inform the appellate court of his dilemma, so that the appellate court might implement the special provision of R.C. 163.22 which mandates that \u2018[a]ll proceedings brought under sections 163.01 to 163.22, inclusive, * * * shall be advanced as a matter of immediate public interest and concern and shall be heard by the court at the earliest practicable moment.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">{\u00b6 111} The appellants concede that per R.C. 163.19, \u201can agency in possession of appropriated property is shielded from a [former] property\u2019s owner\u2019s attempts to prevent the demolition of his [former] property during the appellate process.\u201d In this way, the taking operates so that \u201cthe true rule of justice for the public would be, to pay the compensation with one hand whilst they apply the axe with the other.\u201d <em>Parks v. Boston </em>(1834), 32 Mass. (15 Pick.) 198, 208, 1834 WL 2628.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">{\u00b6 112} The appellants contend, however, that because Norwood transferred title to Rookwood after the taking, R.C. 163.19 no longer applies, because Rookwood is not an \u201cagency\u201d as required by the statute. The trial court rejected this argument, holding that pursuant to the express language of R.C. 163.19, \u201conce Norwood deposited the full amount, Norwood was free to take and use the property pending appeal; this includes transferring the property pursuant to its urban renewal plan.\u201d We agree in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">{\u00b6 113} It is clear that the General Assembly enacted R.C. Chapter 163 with full knowledge of the issues implicated by appropriation and eminent-domain proceedings, ultimately favoring a scheme in which such matters receive expedited attention in the courts, as provided by R.C. 163.22, but in which injunctive relief pending appellate consideration is not permitted. Although we agree with the court of appeals\u2019 apparent conclusion that the term \u201cuse\u201d in R.C. 163.19 was intended to encompass the right to transfer appropriated property to another who may raze and redevelop it, we do not agree that the General Assembly may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>preclude appellate courts from issuing an injunction preventing that use pending further appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">{\u00b6 114} The separation-of-powers doctrine represents the constitutional diffusion of power within our tripartite government. The doctrine was a deliberate design to secure liberty by simultaneously fostering autonomy and comity, as well as interdependence and independence, among the three branches. See, e.g., <em>Fairview v. Giffee </em>(1905), 73 Ohio St. 183, 187, 76 N.E. 865; <em>Zanesville v. Zanesville Tel. &amp; Tel. Co. </em>(1900), 63 Ohio St. 442, 451, 59 N.E. 109; <em>Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co. v. Sawyer </em>(1952), 343 U.S. 579 635, 72 S.Ct. 863, 96 L.Ed. 1153 (Jackson, J., concurring). The doctrine \u201cis \u2018implicitly embedded in the entire framework of those sections of the Ohio Constitution that define the substance and scope of powers granted to the three branches of state government.\u2019 \u201d <em>State ex rel. Bray v. Russell, </em>89 Ohio St.3d 132, 134, 729 N.E.2d 359, quoting <em>S. Euclid v. Jemison </em>(1986), 28 Ohio St.3d 157, 159, 28 OBR 250, 503 N.E.2d 136. We previously explained as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">{\u00b6 115} \u201c \u2018[T]he people possessing all governmental power, adopted constitutions, completely distributing it to appropriate departments.\u2019 <em>Hale v. State </em>(1896), 55 Ohio St. 210, 214, 45 N.E. 199, 200. They vested the legislative power of the state in the General Assembly (Section 1, Article II, Ohio Constitution), the executive power in the Governor (Section 5, Article III, Ohio Constitution), and the judicial power in the courts (Section 1, Article TV, Ohio Constitution). They also specified that \u2018 \u201c[t]he general assembly shall [not] * * * exercise any judicial power, not herein expressly conferred.\u201d \u2019 Section 32, Article II, Ohio Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">{\u00b6 116} \u201cThe power and duty of the judiciary to determine the constitutionality and, therefore, the validity of the acts of the other branches of government have been firmly established as an essential feature of the Ohio system of separation of powers. See, <em>e.g., Beagle v. Walden </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 59, 62, 676 N.E.2d 506, 508 (\u2018[interpretation of the state and federal Constitutions is a role exclusive to the judicial branch\u2019).\u201d <em>State ex rel.

Sheward </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 451, 462, 715 N.E.2d 1062.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-8\">{\u00b6 117} There can be no debate that pursuant to Section 1, Article IY of the Ohio Constitution, the judicial power resides exclusively in the judicial branch, <em>Bray, </em>89 Ohio St.3d at 136, 729 N.E.2d 359, and <em>Ex parte Logan Branch of State Bank </em>(1853), 1 Ohio St. 432, and that our authority within that realm shall not be violated. Indeed, jurists have long understood that they must be wary of any usurpation of the powers conferred on the judiciary by constitutional mandate and any intrusion upon the courts\u2019 inherent powers, i.e., those powers that \u201care necessary to the orderly and efficient exercise of jurisdiction\u201d and without which \u201cno other [power] could be exercised.\u201d <em>Hale, </em>55 Ohio St. 210, 213, 45 N.E. 199. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>Vigilance is necessary to ensure the security and harmony of the government, <em>Weaver v.

The Supreme Court of Kentucky more fully explained as follows in striking as unconstitutional the portion of a state statute that forbade the courts to enjoin an order revoking a license to serve alcoholic beverages pending appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">{\u00b6 119} \u201c[W]e now * * * once and for all make clear that a court, once having obtained jurisdiction of a cause of action, has, as an incidental to its constitutional grant of power, inherent power to do all things reasonably necessary to the administration of justice in the case before it. <em>In the exercise of this power, a court, when necessary in order to protect or preserve the subject matter of the litigation, </em>to protect its jurisdiction and to make its judgment effective, <em>may grant or issue a temporary injunction in aid of or ancillary to the principal action.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b700-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>{\u00b6 120} \u201cThe control over this inherent judicial power, in this particular instance the injunction, is exclusively within the constitutional realm of the courts. As <em>such, it is not within the purview of the legislature to grant or deny the power nor is it within the purview of the legislature to shape or fashion circumstances under which this inherently judicial power may be or may not be granted or denied. </em>* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">{\u00b6 121} \u201c * * * The statutorily granted right to appeal under [state statutes] was [appellant\u2019s] basis for this action * * *. However, the fact that the legislature statutorily provided for this appeal does not give it the right to encroach upon the constitutionally granted powers of the judiciary. Once the administrative action has ended and the right to appeal arises the legislature is void of any right to control a subsequent appellate judicial proceeding. The judicial rules have come into play and have preempted the field.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">{\u00b6 122} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">{\u00b6 123} \u201cThe language of [the provision of the statute forbidding injunctions] directly locks horns with the constitutionally inherent injunction power of the courts when it says, \u2018No court may enjoin the operation of an order of revocation or suspension pending an appeal.\u2019 Such language is a classic example of the very type of legislative encroachment onto the power of the judicial branch of our government which is constitutionally impermissible.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Smothers, </em>672 S.W.2d at 64-65.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">{\u00b6 124} In <em>Hochhausler, </em>76 Ohio St.3d 455, 668 N.E.2d 457, we reached a similar result after examining the no-stay provision that prohibited the courts from staying a suspension of a driver\u2019s license imposed for operating a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol. After reiterating that the courts \u201c \u2018possess all powers necessary to secure and safeguard the free and untrammeled exercise of their judicial functions and cannot be directed, controlled or impeded therein by other branches of the government,\u2019 \u201d id. at 464, 668 N.E.2d 457, quoting <em>State ex rel. Johnston v. Taulbee </em>(1981), 66 Ohio St.2d 417, 20 O.O.3d 361, 423 N.E.2d 80, paragraph two of the syllabus, we held that the no-stay provision deprived courts of their proper authority to stay administrative suspensions by improperly interfering with the exercise of judicial functions. We thus found that the statute violated the doctrine of separation of powers and was unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-8\">{\u00b6 125} We find the rationale of <em>Hochhausler </em>compelling here, particularly given the rights and risks implicated by eminent-domain actions. R.C. 163.19\u2019s blanket proscription on stays or injunctions against the taking and using of appropriated property pending appellate review is an unconstitutional encroachment on the judiciary\u2019s constitutional and inherent authority in violation of the separation-of-powers doctrine.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>{\u00b6 126} As we recently held in <em>State v. Foster, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 1, 2006-Ohio-856, 845 N.E.2d 470, \u00b6 94-95, per R.C. 1.50, severance of an unconstitutional portion of a statute is appropriate when the <em>Geiger </em>test is satisfied. See <em>Geiger v. Geiger </em>(1927), 117 Ohio St. 451, 466, 160 N.E. 28 (requiring that three questions be answered in determining whether severance is appropriate: \u201c(1) Are the constitutional and the unconstitutional parts capable of separation so that each may be read and may stand by itself? (2) Is the unconstitutional part so connected with the general scope of the whole as to make it impossible to give effect to the apparent intention of the Legislature if the clause or part is stricken out? (3) Is the insertion of words or terms necessary in order to separate the constitutional part from the unconstitutional part, and to give effect to the former only?\u201d). We hold that <em>Geiger </em>is satisfied in this case and therefore severance is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">{\u00b6 127} Severing the unconstitutional portion of R.C. 163.19 leaves only the first sentence, which reads as follows: \u201cSubject to sections 163.07 and 163.09 of the Revised Code, any party may prosecute appeals as in other civil actions from the judgment of the court.\u201d Although it appears that part of the legislature\u2019s intent in the statute was to prevent the issuance of stays or injunctions pending appellate review, <em>Pope, </em>54 Ohio St.2d at 18-19, 8 O.O.3d 7, 374 N.E.2d 406, even if doing so could lead to the destruction of the property that is the subject of the appeal, <em>State ex rel. Horwitz v. Cuyahoga Cty. Court of Common Pleas, Probate Div. </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 323, 328, 603 N.E.2d 1005, the severance of the constitutionally infirm portion of the statute (i.e., that portion that bars injunctions or stays pending appellate review) leaves vital language. The first sentence of the statute provides a right of appeal to litigants in eminent-domain proceedings \u201cas in other civil actions from the judgment of the court,\u201d but \u201c[sjubject to sections 163.07 and 163.09 of the Revised Code.\u201d Because there is no inherent right of appeal from a judgment and the General Assembly has the authority to limit the power of appellate courts to review judgments of the trial courts, see <em>Pope, </em>54 Ohio St.2d at 15, 17-18, 8 O.O.3d 7, 374 N.E.2d 406, the first sentence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>R.C. 163.19 is necessary to effectuate part of the legislative intent in enacting the statute. That section can stand on its own without the insertion or inclusion of words not present in the statute. Further, it serves an important role independent of the severed section. The <em>Geiger </em>test is thus satisfied. The unconstitutional portion of R.C. 163.19 can be severed from the rest of the statute, and, accordingly, the remainder of the statute remains in effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">{\u00b6 128} In reaching the conclusion that part of R.C. 163.19 is unconstitutional, we recognize that our decisions in <em>Pope, State ex rel. Suburban Constr. Co. v. Skok </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 645, 648, 710 N.E.2d 710, and <em>Horwitz, </em>65 Ohio St.3d 323, 328, 603 N.E.2d 1005, may suggest a different result. Closer scrutiny of those cases, however, shows that in those cases we did not address the issue whether R.C. 163.19 violates the separation of powers, which controls the result here.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">{\u00b6 129} In <em>Pope, </em>utility companies sought to acquire easements across properties for a high-voltage transmission line. The property owners in that case argued that R.C. 163.19 rendered meaningless appellate review of the trial court\u2019s decision and thereby deprived the appellants of due process. We held that R.C. 163.19 did not offend due process, but we did not address whether it infringed on judicial authority. <em>Pope </em>is thus distinguishable from the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">{\u00b6 130} Similarly, in <em>Skok, </em>we did not consider whether R.C. 163.19 violated the separation-of-powers doctrine. <em>Skok </em>was an appeal from a denial of a writ of prohibition sought to prevent a judge from proceeding further in an appropriation case. We held that the \u201cmere fact that [the property owner] may lose its right to enter and take possession of the property pending appeal, see R.C. 163.15 and 163.19, [did] not render appeal an inadequate remedy,\u201d because if the property owner were to prevail on appeal, it would be entitled to repossess the property, and the money that had been deposited by appellee as security would make the property owner whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-8\">{\u00b6 131} In <em>Horwitz, </em>65 Ohio St.3d 323, 603 N.E.2d 1005, the appellant was a leaseholder of property that was subject to appropriation. The trial court ruled that Horwitz lacked standing to challenge the appropriation because the lessor had not contested it. Horwitz then brought an action for mandamus to compel the court to grant her a hearing to challenge the right to and necessity of the appropriation.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-9\">{\u00b6 132} We found merit in Horwitz\u2019s averment that she lacked an adequate remedy pending appeal because she could not recover even the financial protections afforded by the statute because her right to a hearing on compensation had been denied. Id. at 328, 603 N.E.2d 1005. In light of the inadequacy of any appellate remedy in that unique context, a divided court granted her mandamus relief. As in <em>Pope </em>and <em>Skok, </em>however, we did not address any issue related to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>separation-of-powers doctrine. Thus, despite our past discussions of the statute-, we have never suggested that it represents a valid exercise of legislative prerogative in light of the separation-of-powers doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">{\u00b6 133} But for our orders in this case, the appellants\u2019 property would likely have already been razed. Although we reiterate that it is imperative that appellate courts review these cases as expeditiously as possible, <em>Pope, </em>54 Ohio St.2d at 19, 8 O.O.3d 7, 374 N.E.2d 406, we doubt the courts\u2019 ability, absent the authority to issue a stay, to move more quickly than a bulldozer.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">{\u00b6 134} In light of our holding, we reverse the judgments of the court of appeals denying injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">IY. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b703-8\">{\u00b6 135} We are cognizant of the particular importance of this decision and its pronouncements of constitutional law in informing the actions that are to be taken by the General Assembly. We agree with the following statement made by Justice Zarella in his opinion concurring in part with and dissenting in part from the Supreme Court of Connecticut\u2019s decision in <em>Kelo:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b703-9\">{\u00b6 136} \u201cGrowing fears regarding the potential abuse of the eminent domain power cannot be dismissed as idle speculation on the part of commentators. As municipalities increasingly struggle to provide public services with limited financial resources, governmental authorities are encouraging more intensive economic development to generate additional tax revenue, to create new jobs and to jump start local economies. Accordingly, there is a gathering storm of public debate as to whether the use of eminent domain to acquire property for private economic development in nonblighted areas is justified. * * * [S]uch debate is essential to clarify the role of the legislature in making determinations of public use and the corresponding role of the courts in safeguarding the rights of private property owners who fear that the takings power will be used solely to benefit private interests. The complementary roles of the legislature and the judiciary as interpreters and guardians of the takings power thus require further examination.\u201d 268 Conn. at 133, 843 A.2d 500 (Zarella, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys id=\"b704-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>Wood <em>&amp; </em>Lamping, L.L.P, and Robert P.

Any suggestion that our past decisions finding a public use in urban redevelopment support the notion that appropriations for purely economic purposes must also be permitted is incorrect. In past cases, we found that the removal of blight alone conferred a sufficient public benefit to warrant the taking because the discrete act of removing blight served to remove an extant health threat to the public.

Although Justice Stevens suggested that the ensuing redevelopment of the blighted property at issue in <em>Berman, </em>348 U.S. 26, 34, 75 S.Ct. 98, 99 L.Ed. 27, was a critical complement to the razing of the blighted property, see <em>Kelo, </em>545 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. at 2665, 162 L.Ed.2d 439, fn. 13, we disagree that the secondary step of remediation is necessarily critical in all cases. A public benefit may inure from redevelopment, but such a benefit might also be conferred by the preservation of open land to secure recreational, ecological, and aesthetic value in a community. See, e.g., <em>Merrill, </em>127 N.H. at 237-238, 499 A.2d 216.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b693-10\">. The conditions found by the trial court here are endemic to urban neighborhoods, including some of the most exclusive in America, e.g., Beacon Hill in Boston, Greenwich Village and Tribeca in lower Manhattan, and Nob Hill in San Francisco.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b696-11\">. There is no dispute that Norwood is an \u201cagency\u201d as that term is defined by R.C. 163.19, see R.C. 163.01(A), and that Norwood paid the compensation awards assessed by the jury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b700-9\">. We recognize that some courts have held that a legislative body may prohibit a court from issuing injunctions without infringing on the separation of powers, but each of those cases presented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>unusual circumstances, such as annexation proceedings, see, e.g., <em>Westminster v. Adams Cty. Dist. Court </em>(1968), 167 Colo. 263, 268, 447 P.2d 537; war or other national emergency, see, e.g., <em>Taylor v. Brown </em>(Emergency Ct.App.1943), 137 F.2d 654; see, also, <em>Lauf v. E.G. Shinner &amp; Co., Inc. </em>(1938), 303 U.S. 323, 58 S.Ct. 578, 82 L.Ed. 872 (affirming constitutionality of Norris-LaGuardia Act, Section 101 et seq., U.S.Code, which forbids, inter alia, the issuance of temporary or permanent injunctions in cases arising from labor disputes, absent certain requisite findings); <em>Baton Rouge Coca-Cola Bottling Co., Ltd. v. Gen. Truck Drivers Warehousemen &amp; Helpers, Local Union No. 5 </em>(La.1981), 403 So.2d 632, 636; <em>Levering &amp; Garrigues Co. v.

When exigent or unique circumstances are not present and the bar of injunctive relief leaves a party without sufficient remedy, the rationale for the bar fails. See, e.g., <em>Peoples Gas Light &amp; Coke Co. v. Slattery </em>(1939), 373 Ill. 31, 41-42, 25 N.E.2d 482; <em>Lougee v. New Mexico Bur. of Revenue Commr. </em>(1938), 42 N.M. 115, 76 P.2d 6, 15; <em>Eddy v. Lee Twp. </em>(1888), 73 Mich. 123, 129, 40 N.W. 792; <em>Guy v. Hermance </em>(1855), 5 Cal. 73, 63 Am.

Recognizing that the General Assembly is currently reviewing legislation in this area of law, we have limited our decision to those points of law that we feel must be decided at this juncture. We note, however, that given our reaffirmation that the Ohio Constitution confers on the individual fundamental rights to property that may be violated only when a greater public need requires it, there are significant questions about the validity of the presumption in favor of the state that is set forth in R.C. 163.09(B), which provides that a resolution or ordinance of an agency declaring the necessity of an appropriation shall be prima facie evidence of necessity in the absence of a showing by the property owner of an abuse of discretion. See <em>Grace v. Koch </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 677, 692 N.E.2d 1009, syllabus (holding that elements of adverse possession must be proved by clear and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>convincing evidence); <em>Addington v.
