On appeal, that judgment was affirmed. <em>State v. Haynes, </em>Franklin App. No. 01AP-430, 2002-Ohio-4389, 2002 WL 1969636. This court did not accept Haynes\u2019s discretionary appeal. 97 Ohio St.3d 1484, 2002-Ohio-6866, 780 N.E.2d 287.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-17\">{\u00b6 3} On January 17, 2006, Haynes filed a petition in the Court of Appeals for Scioto County for a writ of habeas corpus to compel appellee, Southern Ohio <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>Correctional Facility Warden Edwin Voorhies, to release him from prison. Haynes claimed that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to convict and sentence him for felony murder because the amendment of his indictment to charge that crime was improper for the reason that felony murder is not a lesser included offense of aggravated felony murder. On February 13, 2006, the warden filed a motion to dismiss the petition for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. On February 16, 2006, the court of appeals granted the warden\u2019s motion and dismissed the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">{\u00b6 4} In his appeal as of right, Haynes asserts that the court of appeals erred in dismissing his habeas corpus petition. For the following reasons, Haynes\u2019s claims lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">{\u00b6 5} As the court of appeals held, habeas corpus is not available to remedy a claim concerning the validity of an amendment to an indictment. See, e.g., <em>Howard v. Randle, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 281, 2002-Ohio-2122, 767 N.E.2d 268, \u00b6 6; <em>State ex rel. Richard v. Seidner </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 149, 151, 666 N.E.2d 1134. Haynes\u2019s claim \u201cchallenges the validity or sufficiency of his [amended] indictment, is nonjurisdictional in nature, and should have been raised in an appeal of his criminal conviction rather than in habeas corpus.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Raglin v. Brigano </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 410, 696 N.E.2d 585.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">{\u00b6 6} Moreover, insofar as Haynes raised the issue of the propriety of the lesser included offense of felony murder (see <em>Haynes, </em>supra, at \u00b6 115-116) in his previous unsuccessful appeal, res judicata bars him from using habeas corpus \u201c \u2018to gain successive appellate reviews of the same issue.\u2019 \u201d <em>Smith v. Bradshaw, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 50, 2006-Ohio-1829, 845 N.E.2d 516, \u00b6 15, quoting <em>State ex rel. Rash v. Jackson, </em>102 Ohio St.3d 145, 2004-Ohio-2053, 807 N.E.2d 344, \u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-8\">{\u00b6 7} Finally, even assuming the invalidity of Haynes\u2019s murder conviction, he is not entitled to the writ, because he is also incarcerated on convictions for kidnapping and rape. \u201c \u2018Where a petitioner is incarcerated for several crimes, the fact that the sentencing court may have lacked jurisdiction to sentence him on one of the crimes does not warrant his release in habeas corpus.\u2019 \u201d <em>Marshall v. Lazaroff </em>(1997), 77 Ohio St.3d 443, 444, 674 N.E.2d 1378, quoting <em>Swiger v. Seidner </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 685, 687, 660 N.E.2d 1214.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-9\">{\u00b6 8} For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-10\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b556-11\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell and Lanzinger, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<attorneys id=\"b557-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>Shannon Haynes, pro se.</attorneys>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
