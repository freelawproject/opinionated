James \u2014 counsel for the defendant \u2014 has filed an affidavit with the clerk of this court under R.C. 2701.03 seeking the disqualification of Judge Dale Crawford from acting on any further proceedings in case No. 05-CVH-4855 in the Court of Common Pleas of Franklin County.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1224\">*1224</page-number>{\u00b6 2} James alleges that Judge Crawford is biased and prejudiced against defendant Blackwell because Blackwell recently sought a writ of prohibition from this court to prevent the judge from hearing the case in the trial court. This court denied Blackwell\u2019s request for a writ in September 2005, 106 Ohio St.3d 447, 2005-Ohio-5124, 835 N.E.2d 1232, and Judge Crawford has now filed a motion in the prohibition case asking this court to impose sanctions against Blackwell\u2019s attorneys. Judge Crawford\u2019s motion describes defendant Blackwell\u2019s effort to secure a writ of prohibition as frivolous. The judge\u2019s firm stance in the prohibition case opposing the legal position taken by defendant Blackwell in this court will prevent the judge from deciding fairly and impartially the case before him involving Blackwell, according to affiant James.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\">{\u00b6 3} Judge Crawford has responded to the affidavit. He contends that he holds \u201cabsolutely no bias or prejudice toward any party or litigant\u201d in the case and states that he \u201ccan be totally fair in dealing with this matter in the future.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">{\u00b6 4} I conclude that Judge Crawford should be disqualified from presiding over any further proceedings in the case before him involving defendant Blackwell. Although the judge\u2019s response to the affidavit conveys no hint of animosity toward any of the parties or their counsel, his motion for sanctions against Blackwell\u2019s attorneys in the prohibition case and his description of their legal stance as \u201cthe height of frivolous conduct\u201d might reasonably cause an objective observer to harbor serious doubts about the judge\u2019s ability to weigh fairly and impartially any additional arguments that those same attorneys might offer on behalf of defendant Blackwell in the trial court. To be sure, the judge\u2019s own assessment of his impartiality is \u201ccertainly entitled to some weight,\u201d <em>In re Disqualification of Lewis, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 1239, 2004-Ohio-7359, 826 N.E.2d 299, \u00b6 11, but a judge should disqualify himself or herself in a proceeding \u201cin which the judge\u2019s impartiality might reasonably be questioned.\u201d Canon 3(E)(1) of the Code of Judicial Conduct. I conclude that the proceeding before Judge Crawford is in fact one in which his impartiality could reasonably be questioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">{\u00b6 5} Had the judge simply opposed defendant Blackwell\u2019s request for a writ of prohibition in this court, disqualification would probably not be required. The judge was not satisfied, however, with this court\u2019s decision denying Blackwell\u2019s requested writ. He has instead \u2014 with vitriolic language \u2014 taken the affirmative step of asking this court to impose financial sanctions against Blackwell\u2019s attorneys, describing their arguments as baseless and frivolous. Judge Crawford\u2019s quest to see that Blackwell\u2019s attorneys are punished financially for pursuing the prohibition case in this court would be apt to cause the reasonable and uninvolved observer to question the judge\u2019s ability to preside fairly and impartially over further trial proceedings involving defendant Blackwell.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1225\">*1225</page-number>{\u00b6 6} I have followed this same course in similar cases. See, e.g., <em>In re Disqualification of Sheward </em>(1996), 77 Ohio St.3d 1258, 1260, 674 N.E.2d 365 (judge whose comments reflected no bias or prejudice but could nonetheless \u201csuggest to a reasonable person the appearance of prejudice\u201d was disqualified \u201cto ensure the parties\u2019 absolute confidence in the fairness\u201d of the proceedings in his court); <em>In re Disqualification of Ruehlman </em>(1991), 74 Ohio St.3d 1229, 1230, 657 N.E.2d 1339 (judge\u2019s disqualification ordered \u201cin the interest of avoiding even the appearance of any bias or prejudice\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">{\u00b6 7} For the reasons stated above, Judge Dale Crawford is disqualified from further proceedings in the case before him involving defendant Blackwell. The case is returned to the administrative judge of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas for reassignment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
