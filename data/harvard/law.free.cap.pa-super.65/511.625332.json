On Feb. 11, 191-1, she gave birth to a second son, Lane K. Conn, and on February 23,1911, she died. Letters of administration c. t. a. were issued to decedent\u2019s husband, Bert T. Conn. The administrator in his account claimed credit for $552.50 funeral and medical attendance, and $600 for the cost of .stone work in the cemetery lot. No objections were made to the account. The auditing judge for the purpose of computing the share to which the after-born son Lane K. Conn was entitled added the whole of the funeral and medical expenses, and allowed only $250 for the cemetery work thus surcharging the accountant with $350. Of the bal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>anee one-third was awarded to Lane K. Conn, $250 to a trustee for Bert W. Conn, and the remainder to Bert T.

Conn is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-15\">\u201cPhila., January 28-1914</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-16\">\u201cThis is my last request, that the cemetery lot be enclosed with a coping to correspond with my mother\u2019s and a suitable headstone erected. \u2022</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-17\">\u201cTo my son Bert Wagner Conn I leave two hundred and fifty dollars to be used as a wedding gift, or education &amp; business provided he develops into a good industrious boy.

Conn.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AhP\">(1) We are of the opinion that the court below properly held that the will made no provision for the child, Lane K. Conn, who was born after the date of the will. Section 15, of the Act of April 8, 1883, P. L. 249, provides, inter alia, that \u201cwhen any person shall make his last will and testament, and afterwards shall marry or have a child or children not provided for in such will, ......although such child or children be born after the death of their father, every such person, so far as shall regard the widow or child or children after-born, shall be deemed and construed to die intestate.\u201d Under this act the will must show the testator had in mind the child to be born, and make clear his intention that his will shall apply to it: Randall v. Dunlap, 218 Pa. 210. The will must make some provision for it: Fidelity Company\u2019s App., 121 Pa. 1. It is clear that the testatrix had no intention of providing for an after-born son.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-12\">(2) The husband, Bert T. Conn, was properly charged with the expenses of the last illness and the funeral expenses of his wife, Lucy W. Conn: Waesch\u2019s Est., 166 Pa. 204.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-13\">(3) The testatrix having provided \u201cthat the cemetery lot be enclosed with a coping to correspond with my mother\u2019s and a suitable headstone erected,\u201d it was a legitimate charge to be made against her estate. The auditing judge apparently so found for he allowed the sum of $250 for the purpose, surcharging the accountant with the sum of $350 in the following language \u201cand on ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>count of cemetery \u2014 stonework (an allowance of $250 only out of an estate of this size appearing reasonable).\u201d The auditing judge said in his adjudication: \u201cThere was no objection to the account which consists solely of personal property.\u201d The accountant had claimed credit in his account for the sum of $600 for the stonework in the cemetery lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">Ordinarily the items of charge and discharge in an account filed by an administrator or executor, being verified by oath, are prima facie proof of their correctness. This is particularly so in this case because the testatrix directed what should be done and it must be presumed, there being no evidence to the contrary, that the accountant did the work directed by the will and that the amount charged was proper. We are, therefore, of opinion that the lower court erred in surcharging the husband of the testatrix with the $350 on the stonework item.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">The decree of the Orphans\u2019 Court, as to the surcharge of $350 for stonework, is reversed, and the record remitted to the court below with direction to amend the decree of distribution in accordance herewith. The costs of the appeal to be paid by the estate.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
