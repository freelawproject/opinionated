Before Patterson, J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b407-8\">The evidence tended to show that the accident happened while the defendant, in driving his automobile at a high rate of speed, attempted to pass through a narrow space between the plaintiff\u2019s horse and wagon and another team, and struck the horse and injured it so that it had to be killed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b407-9\">The court charged as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b407-10\">This is a suit for damages brought by Samuel W. Kuen against Harvey L. Wertley. The damages are alleged to have arisen from a collision between plaintiff\u2019s wagon, and the defendant\u2019s automobile. \u25a0 It is admitted that the defendant is the owner of a certain automobile, and that the automobile collided with the shaft of the wagon belonging to the plaintiff on the 20th day of December, 1913, in the neighborhood of Broad and Cayuga streets, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>while the wagon was being driven south on the west side of Broad street.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b408-4\">Now one of the questions for you to decide is, how did the accident occur? Was it an unavoidable accident that could not be prevented by ordinary care upon the part of the driver of the wagon and owner of the automobile? If so, your verdict must be for the defendant, because if it were nobody\u2019s fault, then nobody can be held legally responsible. Or did the accident occur through the carelessness of the driver of the wagon, either entirely or partially? If so, then your verdict must be for the defendant, because the doctrine of contributory negligence would apply, and that doctrine is that if an accident occurs through the negligence \u2014 that is, either the doing of something that a man of ordinary care would not do under the circumstances, or the omitting to do something that a man of ordinary care would do under the circumstances \u2014 I say if an accident occurs through the negligence of the party who is injured, or his servants, then there can be no recovery.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b408-5\">But if you find that the driver of the wagon was free from any negligence at all in driving down Broad street, and he was doing that which a man of ordinary care would do under the circumstances, then the next question for you to determine is whether the man that operated the automobile was exercising the care that a man of ordinary caution would exercise in operating an automobile along Broad street at that time, and place, and if you find that he was not careful, was not looking where he was going, or not operating his automobile with reasonable care, and that his lack of care caused this collision, then you may find a verdict in favor of the plaintiff, provided you find that the plaintiff\u2019s servant was in no way negligent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b408-6\">Under such circumstances the plaintiff would be entitled to recover for the loss of his horse. It is admitted that the horse was injured in such a fashion that he had to eventually be killed.</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AKzH\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>December 18, 1916:</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b409-3\">Verdict and judgment for plaintiff for. $200.

The question of the defendant\u2019s negligence in attempting to drive between the two wagons \u00aband of his manner of driving were, under the evidence, purely questions of fact. There was ample testimony to warrant the verdict of $200 which, as we view it, was not excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-9\">The judgment of the court below is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
