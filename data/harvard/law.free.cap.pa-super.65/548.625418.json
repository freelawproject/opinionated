McCarthy, one of the defendants, was the owner of certain real estate in the Borough of Mt. Union, Huntingdon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>County; that she and her husband, A. R. McCarthy, agreed with the plaintiff that if he would obtain for them a purchaser or purchasers for said real estate they would pay him a reasonable consideration or commission for his services; that through the efforts of the plaintiff a purchaser was secured who bought from the said Mary T. McCarthy the residence in which she and her family resided for the sum of $19,000, and that because of the premises recited the plaintiff is entitled to a commission of two per cent, on the sale. The first objection presented against the record is that a joint contract was pleaded whereas the evidence shows a several contract, if a contract existed. Mrs. McCarthy was the owner of the premises sold. That fact was well known to the plaintiff and his own evidence shows that the husband was acting as agent for the wife in the sale of her property which included other pieces which had been theretofore sold. Nothing in the case shows that A. R. McCarthy was pretending to be the owner of the property or that any fact was concealed as to the ownership thereof. The plaintiff himself testified on the point as follows: \u201cQ. \u2014 Prior to this you had an agreement with Dr. McCarthy for two per cent.? A. \u2014 Yes, sir; on all property I sold for them. Q. \u2014 Who was he acting for? A. \u2014 As the agent for his wife, Mrs. McCarthy.\u201d The fact of the husband\u2019s relation to the business appears in other parts of the testimony from all of which the conclusion is inevitable that whatever he did with respect to the property was done for his wife and not as the owner of the property or as a principal in the transaction. The plaintiff\u2019s allegation was that he had a contract for a commission of two per cent, for the sale of any of the property of Mrs. McCarthy in Mt. Union. This appears not only from the evidence as above quoted but from additional testimony of the plaintiff: \u201cQ. \u2014 Well, now, Mr. Covert, did the doctor say he would give you two per cent, on this particular sale? A. \u2014 No, he didn\u2019t say. that he would give it on that particular sale but on all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>the property I sold for him or for them, and he says \u2018The property belongs to my wife, and don\u2019t say anything to her, but I will pay you without her knowing it.\u2019 Q. \u2014 When was that? A. \u2014 Any time while we would be talking about selling property. When I would go to look at a property and bring a man there, he would say, \u2018I don\u2019t have the money to-day; I don\u2019t Want to give you a check, so my wife won\u2019t know how much I pay.\u2019 Q. \u2014 Did the doctor offer you anything the time you met him on the street and asked him about this house? A. \u2014 He didn\u2019t say anything because he had offered me before, that was the reason I was selling it. Q. \u2014 Was there any sum mentioned at that time? A.\u2014 No, sir; only the first time we talked it over. Q. \u2014 That was some time during what year? A. \u2014 1915. Q. \u2014 Before any of the other properties were sold? A. \u2014 Before I had ever sold any property at all.\u201d With respect to the payment of a commission he testified: \u201cQ. \u2014 You did not demand the two per cent.? A. \u2014 I did. But he told me that he had to do this without the knowledge of his wife \u2014that she always quarreled at everything he did, but he would make it right in some other bill.\u201d That this arrangement for the two per cent, commission was made with A. R. McCarthy clearly appears also from this part of the plaintiff\u2019s evidence: \u201cNow you told Mrs. McCarthy that you didn\u2019t expect any commission, didn\u2019t you? A. \u2014 No, sir; did not tell her, she asked me what commission, and I said, \u2018\u00edhe commission that the doctor will pay me is a very small commission and that would be all right, because I didn\u2019t expect a big commission.\u2019 \u201d In answer to a question of counsel: \u201cQ. \u2014 And they promised you two per cent, for the sale of the properties,\u201d the \u2022 witness answered \u201ctwo per cent.\u201d This evidently related to the conversation he alleged he had with A. B, McCarthy before any of the sales took place for the witness expressly declared that Mr. McCarthy did not say he would give him two per cent, on this particular sale. It further appears from the evidence quoted that the plaintiff was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>told by Mr. McCarthy that any commission paid must be paid without the knowledge of his wife. These plain declarations and admissions of the plaintiff are wholly inconsistent with his present claim that there was a joint contract for the payment of two per cent, commission on the sale of the dwelling house. When the plaintiff disclosed his agency responsibility for his contract within the scope of his employment was on the employer. As the plaintiff knew that Mr. McCarthy was not the owner of the premises and that Mrs. McCarthy was the person on whose account the sale was to take place, she was responsible for his contract with reference to commissions if he was authorized to employ a person to procure the sale. The contract was not his but that of his wife under such circumstances if the proof established a contract at all. From the whole of the plaintiff\u2019s evidence we have no doubt that any agreement which the plaintiff had was a several contract of one or the other or each of the defendants. The plaintiff\u2019s evidence is inconsistent with any other view of the case and shows a liability of one or the other of the defendants as the facts might be found but aot of the two jointly. A. R. McCarthy although acting as an agent might bind himself personally but such obligation does not support a joint action against him and his wife. An action on a disputed parol contract against two or more must be established by evidence of the terms of the contract and the assent of each of the parties to the obligation. Where the declaration on a contract charges two or more defendants jointly there can be no recovery unless a joint liability is shown and no such liability can be shown if the contract is not joint but several. The defendants were, therefore, entitled to an affirmance of their sixth point which requested binding instructions for the defendants and also to an order making the rule for judgment non obstante veredicto .absolute.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-3\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
