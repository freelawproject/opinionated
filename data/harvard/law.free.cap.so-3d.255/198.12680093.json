On May 11, 2012, a custodian at the school found a firearm in a case located inside a bag that was on top of Lambert's desk in his office, which was located in the band room on the school's campus. Lambert was employed by the Board as the part-time band director at the school at that time. It was undisputed that the band room and Lambert's office had both been locked and that the custodian had unlocked the doors to those rooms with the key the school had issued to her. The custodian contacted school personnel regarding her discovery of the firearm, who, in turn, contacted Scott Hammond, the school's principal. Hammond entered Lambert's office; he looked inside the bag placed on Lambert's desk and saw a case containing a firearm containing a fully loaded ammunition clip and an additional fully loaded ammunition clip. Hammond looked through the other contents of the bag and noticed that, in addition to the firearm and the two ammunition clips, it contained Lambert's checkbook and other personal effects. Lambert was not on campus on May 11, 2012, because he was with a group of band students on an overnight band trip to Atlanta; Lambert and the band students were set to arrive back on the school's campus late on May 12, 2012. Hammond placed the case containing the firearm and ammunition clips inside the pocket of his pants and traveled to his office, where he proceeded to lock the door and to telephone Randall Little, the interim superintendent of the Board at that time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   \"Hammond testified that Little told him to bring the firearm and ammunition clips to the Board's central office, which he did. Hammond further testified that Little also requested that Hammond be present on May 12, 2012, to meet the buses returning from the overnight band trip so that he could speak with Lambert regarding the discovery of the firearm and ammunition clips in his office. Hammond testified that on May 12, 2012, he spoke with Lambert regarding the discovery of the firearm and ammunition clips, that Lambert confirmed that the firearm and ammunition clips were his, and that they set up a meeting to discuss the incident for May 14, 2012.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   \"On May 14, 2012, Lambert met with Hammond at the school's campus to discuss the discovery of his firearm on campus and the potential consequences. At this meeting, Lambert again confirmed that the discovered firearm and ammunition clips were his and that he had inadvertently left them inside his bag inside the locked office, inside the locked band room. He explained that he had forgotten that the firearm and ammunition clips were inside the bag when he brought the bag on the school's campus. Hammond informed Lambert that Board Policy Number 826 entitled 'Board Employees and Weapons' states: 'No employee, with the exception of any law enforcement personnel, will be in\n   possession of an unauthorized weapon on any school premises, including school vehicles, or at any school-planned activity. Violation of this policy will result in suspension or dismissal of the employee.' He further gave Lambert a copy of Board Policy Number 826 and informed him that his options were to resign or to potentially be suspended or terminated from his employment due to his violation of Board Policy Number 826. Lambert testified that, although he knew that the school was a weapon-free campus, he was unaware of Board Policy Number 826 before May 14, 2012.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   \"Following his meeting with Hammond, Lambert hand-delivered his resignation on May 14, 2012. However, on May 15, 2012, Lambert rescinded his resignation. Subsequently, Little placed Lambert on administrative leave and mailed him a letter dated May 18, 2012, informing him that he had been placed on administrative leave. On June 1, 2012, Little sent Lambert a letter informing him that his recommendation to the Board was to terminate Lambert's employment and that Lambert had the right to ask for a hearing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 16-24C-6(b), Ala. Code 1975. Lambert requested a public hearing before the Board in a letter dated June 11, 2012. On July 23, 2012, the parties conducted a hearing before the Board. At the start of the hearing, the Board summarily denied Lambert's four motions to dismiss and his motion to suppress.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    Lambert I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6776466\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/199/751/\">\n    199 So.3d at 754\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   At the hearing before the Board, Lambert presented testimony of several witnesses who indicated that he was of good character and who stated that they would prefer not to see Lambert lose his position as a part-time band director as a result of his inadvertent violation of Board Policy Number 826.\n   <em>\n    Lambert I\n   </em>\n   , 199 So.3d at ----.

In its appellate brief, the Board argues that the hearing officer erred in concluding that the Board acted arbitrarily and capriciously in terminating Lambert's employment and that the hearing officer acted outside his authority under the SFA in remanding the matter with the instruction that the Board impose a suspension of one year or less on Lambert. More specifically, the Board challenges the hearing officer's understanding and application of the arbitrary-and-capricious standard in light of what it construes as the hearing officer's substitution of his judgment for that of the Board regarding the appropriate penalty for the admitted violation of Board Policy Number 826. The Alabama Association of School Boards, appearing as amicus curiae in support of the Board, argues that the hearing officer has misapplied the arbitrary-and-capricious standard and that the hearing officer \"put aside [the deference due the Board's decision] in favor of an analytical framework of his own choosing.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   In response, Lambert argues that the hearing officer complied fully with the remand instructions set out by our supreme court in\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Lambert\n   </em>\n   . He points out that the plurality opinion indicated that a hearing officer is entitled to reverse a school board's decision and to remand for imposition of a lesser penalty.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Lambert\n   </em>\n   , 199 So.3d at 769 (\"[I]f a hearing officer determines that the sanction imposed by an employer is arbitrary and capricious, the hearing officer may remand the matter with instructions to the employer to impose a lesser penalty.\"). Thus, Lambert posits, the hearing officer is entitled to judge whether the penalty imposed is arbitrary and capricious, which, according to Lambert, allows the hearing officer to determine if the penalty is too harsh for the infraction committed. Furthermore, Lambert argues, the Board failed to articulate a reason for choosing to impose termination as a sanction as opposed to the lesser permitted punishment of suspension, thus supporting the conclusion that the Board's imposition of termination of Lambert's employment as a penalty was, in fact, arbitrary and capricious under the facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The appropriate appellate standard of review was set out in\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Lambert\n   </em>\n   , 199 So.3d at 765 :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   \" '[I]t is well established that where the issues involve only the application of law to undisputed facts appellate review is de novo.

Thus, we cannot conclude that the inclusion of the explanation of the term \"arbitrary\" from\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Dunn\n   </em>\n   in any way engrafts onto the SFA a requirement that the Board \"articulate a satisfactory explanation\" for its decision to discharge\n   an employee.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, we cannot agree with Lambert that the Board's failure to articulate its reason for choosing to terminate his employment as opposed to merely suspending him is, itself, a sufficient basis for the hearing officer's conclusion that the Board's decision was arbitrary and capricious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   We now turn to the hearing officer's conclusion that the Board \"did not consider, or insufficiently considered,\" certain facts in making its decision to terminate Lambert's employment. Lambert argues that the hearing officer is entitled to consider the various facts and circumstances and to consider whether the Board adequately considered those facts and circumstances when deciding what penalty to impose for Lambert's violation of Board policy. Lambert insists that the Board's policy, which permits a sanction of termination or suspension, must be understood as allowing for a varying degree of punishment along that spectrum based on the seriousness of the offense and the employee's employment record. Although that might be true, Lambert has not explained to our satisfaction how the hearing officer, who serves as a layer of appellate review, as opposed to the Board, which is the fact-finder, is given the discretion to adjust the penalty as circumstances warrant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The hearing officer states in support of his order reversing the Board's decision that the Board either failed to consider or \"insufficiently considered\" facts like the unintentional nature of the violation, the lack of any actual harm to any student, Lambert's otherwise exemplary record, and the corresponding student policy and the punishment for its violation. Those facts were sufficiently argued to the Board. Willie Grissett, the president of the Board, stated the following on the record before the Board entered executive session to discuss and consider the appropriate penalty for Lambert's violation of Board Policy Number 826:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   \"This concludes the hearing, and the Board will now convene into executive session to consider what action, if any, should be taken, and enter such order as it deems lawful and appropriate. If the Board feels that any or all of the reasons given by the superintendent for the proposed termination are supported by the evidence presented and that these reasons are sufficient, it may act accordingly. If the Board feels that termination is not appropriate under the facts presented, it may order a lesser punishment or no punishment at all.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The record therefore reflects that the Board did consider all arguments presented to it and that, as it began its deliberations, it was aware that it could choose whatever punishment it deemed appropriate. In addition, Grissett clearly stated that the Board could consider the reasons for termination advanced by the superintendent, which are quoted earlier in this opinion. Thus, we cannot agree that the record reflects that the Board failed to consider any factor the hearing officer found to be appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The hearing officer's belief that his finding that the Board had \"insufficiently considered\" the facts and circumstances he found to be relevant could serve as a basis for a determination that the Board's decision was arbitrary and capricious, and that the Board's decision should therefore be reversed, runs counter to the principle that even if a hearing officer \"disagree[s] with the wisdom of the decision, [he] may not substitute [his] judgment for that of the [Board].\"\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Dunn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8357251\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/962/814/#p823\">\n    962 So.2d at 823-24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

These principles undergird the extremely deferential review permitted under the arbitrary-and-capricious standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Little, the interim superintendent, explained his reasons for recommending termination of Lambert's employment: the extreme danger posed by a loaded firearm and the need to hold any violator-student or employee-accountable under the applicable zero-tolerance weapons policy. As Justice Shaw noted in his special writing in\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Lambert\n   </em>\n   , the mere fact that the presence of a loaded gun on campus created a dangerous condition could have negated in the minds of the Board members the very facts and circumstances that the hearing officer determined should have been given more weight. As we have held before, the SFA requires deference to the personnel decisions of school boards in order to support the legislature's stated objective of placing control over maintaining a competent teaching force with those boards.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jacobs\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6794508\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/194/929/#p939\">\n    194 So.3d at 939\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . To allow the hearing officer to determine that the Board did not give sufficient weight to facts and circumstances that, in the hearing officer's opinion, are more weighty than other facts and circumstances involved in the consideration of the appropriate sanction to be imposed by a school board for the violation of its policies undermines the purpose and intent of the SFA and upends the traditional notions regarding the application of the arbitrary-and-capricious standard. Permitting the hearing officer's conclusion that certain facts and circumstances should be given more weight than the fact of the violation itself to supplant the Board's decision to impose termination of employment for the violation of Board Policy Number 826 allows the hearing officer to substitute his judgment for that of the Board based on the hearing officer's disagreement with the wisdom of the Board's decision. Thus, we cannot agree that the hearing officer's decision is properly supported by his determination that the Board did not give sufficient consideration to what the hearing officer has determined are mitigating facts and circumstances supporting a lesser penalty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Our supreme court mandated that the hearing officer apply the traditional arbitrary-and-capricious standard to the decision of the Board.\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Lambert\n   </em>\n   , 199 So.3d at 768 (\"The SFA explicitly directs us to apply 'meanings traditionally accorded the terms and phrases by the appellate courts of this state under prior law,' [Ala.
