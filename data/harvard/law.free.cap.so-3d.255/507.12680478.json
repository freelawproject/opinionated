State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12367656\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/223/1129/#p1129\">\n    223 So.3d 1129\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1129 (Fla. 3d DCA 2017), this Court reversed the trial court's order precluding Luis La-Casse from filing any further\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   post-conviction pleadings in lower court case number F04-29879, and remanded for entry of a Show Cause Order \"to provide La-Casse the opportunity to demonstrate why an order precluding\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   filings should not be entered.\" On remand, on October 12, 2017, the trial court entered a Show Cause Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In November 2017, La-Casse filed a timely response to the Show Cause Order. La-Casse later filed an amended response. For reasons that are unclear in the record, the trial court entered two separate orders \"mooting\" both La-Casse's response and amended response to the Show Cause Order. Indeed, the trial court docket does not reflect that the trial court, on remand, ever\n   issued an order determining whether La-Casse should be precluded from further\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   filings in lower court case number F04-29879.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Based on the record before us and the State's proper and commendable confession of error that the trial court incorrectly mooted La-Casse's responses to the Show Cause Order, we reverse and remand for further proceedings. On remand, the trial court should consider La-Casse's amended response to the trial court's October 12, 2017 Show Cause Order, and adjudicate whether La-Casse should be precluded from further\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   filings in lower case number F04-29879. This Court expresses no opinion on that issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Reversed and remanded.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
