Love\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This appeal arises from the death of a minor child while in foster care. The parents of the minor child contended that the coroner negligently disposed of their son's body. The coroner filed a motion for summary judgment, which the trial court granted, dismissing their claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   We find that the coroner demonstrated that the parents would be unable to meet their burden of proof at trial and that no genuine issues of material fact exist. As such, the trial court did not err by granting the coroner's motion for summary judgment. The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Patrick Simmons, Sr. and Crystal Simmons were the parents of Eli Simmons, a\n   physically and mentally disabled minor child. The State of Louisiana, Department of Children and Family Services (\"DCFS\") removed Eli and his three siblings from their home. Eli was placed in foster care. Eli passed away while in foster care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Eli's body was placed in the custody of the Orleans Parish Coroner on April 8, 2013. The Coroner performed an autopsy of Eli on April 10, 2013. The minute entry in juvenile court\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   on April 9, 2013, notes that Eli's parents requested that Eli not be buried because they wanted to obtain an independent autopsy. The juvenile court ordered DCFS not to have Eli buried until after the independent autopsy. The October 15, 2013 minute entry from juvenile court states that the parents were no longer requesting an independent autopsy, and that Eli's body could be released for burial. On December 10, 2013, in juvenile court, the minute entry indicates that if the Simmons' attorney could not secure an appropriate burial by January 14, 2014, then the juvenile court judge would order DCFS to pay for Eli's burial. In the January 14, 2014 case review hearing, the juvenile court noted that DCFS was working with the Simmons on a proper burial for Eli. DCFS then telephoned the Coroner on January 27, 2014, 294 days after his death, to request the release of Eli's remains. However, the Coroner informed DCFS that Eli's remains were already buried.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Simmons, their three remaining minor children, and Southeast Louisiana Legal Services/Children's Legal Services Project (collectively \"the Simmons\") filed a Petition for Damages against 1) State of Louisiana, Department of Social Services, Office of Community Service; 2) DCFS; 3) Dr. Frank Minyard/Jeffrey Rouse; 4) Orleans Parish Coroner's Office; 5) Saundra Hayes; 6) Brenda Scott; 7) Charrlyse Sandifer; 8) Karen Cross-Caesar; 9) the foster parents; 10) insurer of the foster parents; and 11) the Coroner's Office insurer. The Simmons filed a Supplemental and Amended Petition, which added Drs. Minyard and Rouse in their personal and official capacities, Orleans Parish Government, and their respective insurers as defendants. The Simmons alleged gross negligence and sought damages for wrongful death, survival, loss of consortium, and intentional and/or negligent infliction of emotional distress, among others. The second Supplemental and Amended Petition added the City of New Orleans and its insurer as defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Approximately three years later, the Coroner filed a Motion for Summary Judgment contending that the Simmons lacked factual support for their claims. The trial court found that the Simmons lacked legal interest in Eli's remains, granted the Coroner's Motion for Summary Judgment, and dismissed the Coroner with prejudice. The Simmons' Motion for Devolutive Appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Simmons aver that the trial court erroneously considered improper summary judgment evidence, that genuine issues of material fact remain, and that the trial court should not have dismissed them by finding\n   <em>\n    ex proprio motu\n   </em>\n   that Mr. and Mrs. Simmons had no legal interest in Eli's remains.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \"The summary judgment procedure is designed to secure the just, speedy, and inexpensive determination of every action, except those disallowed by Article 969.\" La.

R.S. 8:658 states that \"[n]o action shall lie against any cemetery authority relating to the remains of any person which have been left in its possession for a period of sixty days, unless a written contract has been entered into with the cemetery authority for the care of such remains.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   La.

R.S. 8:651. Lastly, La. R.S. 8:661 provides that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   Whenever any human remains have been in the lawful possession of any cemetery authority for a period of sixty days or more, and the relatives of or persons interested in the deceased person fail, neglect, or refuse for such periods of time, respectively, to direct the disposition to be made of the body, the body may be disposed of by the cemetery authority having lawful possession thereof, under and in accordance with such rules and regulations, if any, as may be made and promulgated by the governmental authority or authorities having jurisdiction over the matter.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Once the Coroner filed a supported Motion for Summary Judgment, the Simmons were required to produce evidence of a material factual dispute. The Simmons' deposition excerpts attached to their opposition do not contain testimony\n   addressing their suffering as a result of the Coroner's burial of Eli's remains. Likewise, there was no documentation or evidence substantiating a genuine issue of material fact regarding the alleged outrageousness of the Coroner's actions by burying Eli's remains after holding the remains for 241 days. Further, it is undisputed that DCFS did not call the Coroner in regards to burying Eli's remains until 294 days after his death. The Coroner retained Eli's remains for 241 days prior to burying him. The Simmons failed to submit evidence sufficient to show that genuine issues of material fact remained following the Coroner's supported Motion for Summary Judgment. Given the uncorroborated evidence submitted by the Simmons and the duties legally bestowed upon the Coroner's office, we do not find that the trial court erred by granting the Coroner's Motion for Summary Judgment. The judgment of the trial court is affirmed. We pretermit the issue of whether the Simmons have a legal interest in Eli's remains in that we found the Coroner was entitled to summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     DECREE\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   For the above-mentioned reasons, we find that the Simmons failed to meet their burden of proof regarding genuine issues of material fact once the Coroner filed its supported Motion for Summary Judgment. As such, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   MCKAY, C.J., DISSENTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   I respectfully dissent from the majority in this matter and would reverse the judgment of the district court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Arguably, there is a question if upon Eli's death the Louisiana Department of Children and Family Services lost the care custody and control of Eli's remains. Logically, the care custody and control of the child's remains would revert to the parents as the purpose of the Louisiana Department of Children and Family Services ended with the death of the child. While I would agree that the Coroner has a statutory right and obligation to dispose of the remains for the welfare of society benefiting the public at large through public health and public justice, it does not answer the glaring question as to who actually has the legal right to the remains of Eli. I believe that this fact is germane to the matter and needs resolution. This can only be determined by a full trial on the merits.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    Juvenile court proceedings were ongoing based on the removal of Eli and his three siblings from their home.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    Crystal Simmons previously stated that she called the Coroner's office a \"couple\" times, but then said she only called once.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    The Coroner's office qualifies as a cemetery authority pursuant to La.
