The portion of the petition seeking to compel a ruling on a November 28, 2017, motion for discharge is denied as moot. To the extent that Petitioner seeks to compel the circuit court to rule on any additional motions, Petitioner must raises those issues in a new petition for writ of mandamus. Petitioner's request for oral argument, motions for relief, motion for extension of time, and motions to correct the record are denied as moot. Petitioner's motion to dismiss and motion for appointment of counsel for postconviction proceedings are denied without prejudice to Petitioner filing those motions in the circuit court.\n  </p>\n  <judges id=\"p-7\">\n   BLACK, SALARIO, and BADALAMENTI, JJ., Concur.\n  </judges>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
