(\"Dr. Llopis\"), appeals the district court's August 1, 2017 judgment, which granted the exception of no cause of action filed by defendants, the State of Louisiana/Department of Health and Hospitals/Louisiana State Board of Dentistry, the Louisiana State Board of Dentistry, C. Barry Ogden, Brian M. Begue, and Dr. David Melancon (collectively, the \"Board\"). For the reasons that follow, we affirm the judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The underlying dispute in this matter arises from Dr. Llopis' attempts to renew his license to practice dentistry in Louisiana.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. Llopis obtained his Louisiana license in 1993. In 2003, the Board began an investigation of Dr. Llopis. The investigation was not completed because Dr. Llopis was called to active military duty. Dr. Llopis, after moving to the state of Washington, voluntarily surrendered his Louisiana license on November 15, 2006. In October 2010, Dr. Llopis began his efforts to become re-licensed in Louisiana. He first sought a restricted license to work at the Louisiana State University School of Dentistry (\"LSUSD\"); and thereafter, he applied for a temporary license. After the Board failed to re-issue his license, litigation ensued between the parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This matter has been before this Court on three prior occasions. To encapsulate the extensive history behind this litigation, we adopt many of the facts delineated in\n   <em>\n    Llopis v. State\n   </em>\n   , 2016-0041 (La. App. 4 Cir. 12/14/16),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12198895\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so3d/206/1066/\">\n    206 So.3d 1066\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"\n   <em>\n    Llopis III\n   </em>\n   \") as follows.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   Dr. Llopis's first appeal concerned claims against the Board, its executive director, its president and its counsel arising under the Louisiana Open Meetings Law and claims for judicial review of certain decisions of the Board. Those claims were dismissed by the trial court on exceptions of no cause of action. The trial court's judgment was affirmed by this Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Llopis I\n   </em>\n   .\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   Dr. Llopis then filed a first amended petition on January 25, 2012 against the same parties and adding other members of the Board.

The grounds asserted in the motion were that \"the judgment rendered is clearly contrary to the law\" and that \"good ground\" under La. C.C.P. Art. 1973 existed due to the fact that Dr. Llopis did not file an opposition memorandum until one day prior to the hearing (and defendants did not receive a copy of it until the hearing date). The motion was heard on August 7, 2015 and by judgment dated September 2, 2015, the trial court granted the Motion for New Trial, reversing its prior ruling and thereby sustaining the exception of no cause of action and dismissing all of Dr. Llopis' claims.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Dr. Llopis filed a Motion for Appeal on September 21, 2015.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6897512,6897554,6897603,6897491\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/152/152/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , 2016-0041, pp. 2-3,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12198895\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so3d/206/1066/\">\n    206 So.3d at 1068\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Llopis III\n   </em>\n   , this Court noted that the district court's initial denial of the Board's exception of no cause of action was an interlocutory judgment; as such, the district court erred in granting the motion for new trial because no procedure exists for a party to apply for a new trial to seek relief from an interlocutory judgment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   2016-0041, p. 6,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12198895\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so3d/206/1066/\">\n    206 So.3d at 1070\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

After argument, the district court sustained the Exception and dismissed Dr. Llopis' action against the Board with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Dr. Llopis asserts the district court erred by permitting the Board to re-urge its previously denied Exception without presenting any new evidence in support.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Dr. Llopis does acknowledge that, pursuant to La.

We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Lomont\n   </em>\n   , the appellate court did not mandate that a litigant offer new evidence, but rather, the court opined that a district court should find that a \"compelling justification\" exists to re-litigate a peremptory exception.\n   <em>\n    Lomont\n   </em>\n   , 2016-0436, p. 10,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12352353\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/210/435/#p444\">\n    210 So.3d at 444\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Further, the application of the \"law of the case\" doctrine is discretionary; it does not preclude a district court from reconsideration of a judgment overruling a peremptory exception, and subsequent thereto, sustaining the exception.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Landry v.

After review of the Board's Motion for New Trial, the Board's re-urged Exception and Dr. Llopis' opposition, the district court granted the Board's Motion for New Trial and sustained the Exception on the merits; thus, acknowledging that it erred when it first denied the Exception. We find the district court's reasons provide compelling justification to reconsider the Exception. Hence, the district court did not abuse its discretion in allowing the Board to re-urge the Exception.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Adam v.

Moreover, he argues that, on its face, his Petition states a cause of action based on allegations that the Board violated confidentiality procedures by discussing his application with Dr. Ehrlich from LSUSD. Dr. Llopis emphasizes that the facts alleged in paragraphs 8-11 of his Petition\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   -which generally convey that the Board improperly relayed \"the impression\" to LSUSD that Dr. Llopis would not be licensed \"any time soon\"-are malicious acts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Based on the facts of this case, both immunity defenses offer equivalent qualifiers to their application: La.

Moreover, although Dr. Llopis argues on appeal that the Board acted with malice because the Board falsely communicated\n   <em>\n    his license would not be renewed\n   </em>\n   , the Petition itself alleges that the Board had given his potential employer \"the impression\" that he was not going to be licensed\n   <em>\n    any time soon\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   As noted,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , Louisiana has a system of fact pleading and mere conclusions unsupported by facts do not state a cause of action.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ramey v.

In the absence of facts pled that the Board purposefully violated any established procedures or time guidelines for license renewals, the Petition's mere allegation that the Board allegedly relayed the impression of a time frame for Dr. Llopis' license renewal does not rise to the level of malice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In the case\n   <em>\n    sub judice\n   </em>\n   , it is undisputed that the Board was vested with the requisite adjudicatory authority to decide whether or not to re-issue Dr. Llopis' license. Based upon our\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review, we find the Petition does not state and is devoid of any facts that show the Board acted outside its authority or engaged in egregious, malicious misconduct which would require the Board to forfeit its immunity. The purpose of the immunity defense would be effectively eviscerated if courts allowed plaintiffs to maintain a cause of action by merely stating broadly worded, conclusory allegations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lambert v.

Dr. Llopis states in his brief that he received his license renewal in December 2011. This representation seemingly contradicts any claim that the Board relayed a false impression as to when the license might be renewed.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
