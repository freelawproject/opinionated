Rather, disqualification is required where the facts alleged and established, which must be taken as true, would place a reasonably prudent person in fear of not receiving a fair and impartial proceeding.\"). Accordingly, a successor judge shall be immediately appointed pursuant to Florida Rule of Judicial Administration 2.215(b)(4).\n  </p>\n  <judges id=\"p-7\">\n   BLACK and ROTHSTEIN-YOUAKIM, JJ., Concur.\n  </judges>\n  <author id=\"p-8\">\n   ATKINSON, J., would deny the petition for writ of prohibition.\n  </author>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
