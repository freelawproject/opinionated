Belsome\n   This matter was remanded from the Louisiana Supreme Court for the determination of just compensation for the Violet Dock Port's expropriated property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Over several years, St. Bernard Port (\"the Port\") negotiated with Violet Dock Port (\"VDP\") for the purchase of its property along the Mississippi River (\"the Property\"). After negotiations failed, the Port instituted expropriation proceedings pursuant to La. Const. art. I, \u00a7 4.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The courts have determined that the taking of the Property was for a public purpose.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, in accordance with La. Const. art. I, \u00a7 4 (B)(1), VDP was due just compensation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   After a trial on the issue of just compensation, the trial court found that $16,000,000 was just compensation for the expropriated property. In so finding, the trial court indicated it did not have the authority to \"split the baby\" and thus had to choose which party's expert he was going to rely on. The trial court chose to adopt the valuation presented by the Port, which was the amount that had been deposited in the registry of the court. Reviewing that ruling under a manifest error/clearly wrong standard, this Court affirmed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Supreme Court found that the trial court had made its ruling under an erroneous interpretation of the law. More specifically, the Supreme Court opined that the trial court was not\n   bound by any one expert's opinion in its entirety. Accordingly, this Court's affirmation of just compensation was reversed. On remand, we have been directed to conduct a\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review of the evidence in the record to arrive at a valuation of just compensation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   VDP has maintained throughout its appeals that the principles set forth by the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    State, Dept. of Highways v. Constant\n   </em>\n   , should guide the Court in determining just compensation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Constant\n   </em>\n   recognized that the full extent of loss is not always satisfied by the market value analysis based upon comparable sales or other alternate methods that are used in place of fair market value. In\n   <em>\n    Constant\n   </em>\n   , the landowner was operating a marina business at the time that the highway department expropriated a portion of his land. The expropriated portion of land represented the entire loading and parking area of the business. It was established that the loading and parking area was indispensible to the landowner's marina business. The Court noted that the property was unique because the barge slip and adjacent area was the only site available for the commercial loading of heavy equipment servicing the oil industry. The Court reasoned that the property was unique in nature; and the loading and parking area was indispensible to the business's operations. Therefore, the loading and parking area had to be reproduced at another location to maintain the marina business. Accordingly, the Court found that awarding replacement value was the only way to fully compensate the landowner even though that amount exceeded the market value of the land.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In accordance with\n   <em>\n    Constant,\n   </em>\n   if a landowner establishes that the location of the expropriated property or some physical feature of it is unique and indispensably related to the success of the landowner's business, just compensation requires the court to award replacement value. Since\n   <em>\n    Constant,\n   </em>\n   several courts considering those factors have determined that some landowners can only be fully compensated by replacement cost.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Likewise here, the evidence elicited at trial established that: 1) the Property is unique due to its location and its improvements; and 2) the Property was indispensable to VDP's business. The Property is located in Violet, Louisiana and has one mile of frontage along the Mississippi River and similar frontage on St. Bernard Highway and Norfolk Southern railroad, which gives the site access over land, road, rail, and water. It is zoned industrial and is located on a straight, self-dredging bank line making it an ideal location for river navigation. The Port's Executive Director, Dr. Robert Scafidel testified that the other potential locations along the river in St. Bernard Parish were not as desirable for the Port because they were positioned where the river bends, which would impede river traffic. He represented to the State that VDP's property presented a unique opportunity to greatly expand the Port's ability to handle bulk cargo.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Through the years, VDP had constructed a fully operational, private port facility with five steel and concrete docks. Three of the berths were certified by the Navy for lay berthing ocean-going ships. VDP had held contracts for providing services to the Navy for decades. To fulfill the needs of the Navy, VDP had renovated the Property by installing transformers, a potable water supply, six telephone lines per ship, and a boiler for steam necessary for the ships to be poised for immediate deployment. In addition to the mechanical support for the ships, VDP had also constructed landside improvements to comply with Navy specifications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Port highlighted the uniqueness of the Property in its application to the Louisiana Port Construction and Development Program.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Port wrote:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   [t]he best attribute of this site is that it features three sturdy docks designed to berth some of the largest cargo ships in the world. These docks can be easily modified to support cargo handling operations similar to those currently taking place at the Chalmette Slip, such as ship or barge to truck or rail or to storage. The reverse movement is also available.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The application went on to state that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-20\">\n   [t]he opportunity to acquire three active docks on the Mississippi River with available uplands and access to highway and rail, for only $14 million, is an opportunity that does not happen very often, if ever.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Similarly, the Port's Strategic Business Plan stated that the Property \"should be considered a national asset for transportation and manufacturing.\" The Port conceded that the site was one of the last major properties on the Mississippi River that is suitable for cargo with highway, rail, and deep water access on a straight section of the river. Riverfront property is limited in St. Bernard Parish and property with these attributes is nonexistent. The Port relied on the uniqueness of the Property to secure a $15,000,000 grant from the State and to support its public purpose argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Here, as in\n   <em>\n    Constant\n   </em>\n   , the Property was also indispensable for the operation of VDP's business. The appraisals in the record repeatedly recognized that the facility and business operations were highly specialized. That is further evident by the fact that the Port is now servicing the Navy contracts once held by VDP. The Port expropriated the Property because it is unique in nature and location. As a result of the expropriation VDP's business has ceased to exist. Thus, we find that the record supports a finding that the Property was unique in nature and location while also being indispensible to the landowners' business operations requiring just compensation to be calculated by assessing the replacement cost of the land and improvements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   At trial, VDP's experts presented reports and testimony suggesting that full replacement cost for the land and improvements would be $73,148,000 without taking into account depreciation. Alternatively, if the land and improvements were to be depreciated, the replacement value would be $50,930,000. Using numbers derived by the Port's experts, full replacement cost without depreciation amounts to $41,084,000, and with depreciation the amount was determined to be\n   $28,764,685.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The most significant reason for the vast discrepancy in the values is due to the experts' differing opinions on the highest and best use of the Property. VDP's experts' calculations were based on the Property being used as a multimodal bulk cargo facility, while the lower calculations were based on layberthing with a limited cargo operation. Multiple factors are considered when determining the highest and best use of land in an expropriation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, generally, \"the current use of the property is presumed to be the highest and best use.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Port's expert appraiser, Bennett Oubre testified extensively as to his review of the appraisal reports offered by VDP's and the Port's experts. In reviewing the testimony regarding the rationale for the differing appraisals, we find Mr. Oubre's testimony realistically evaluated the character of the Property. Mr. Oubre acknowledged how specialized the Property was while also taking into account the attributes that were problematic. During his testimony, he explained various flaws within VDP's experts' appraisals. The most significant criticism Mr. Oubre had was the use of \"extraordinary assumptions.\" Those \"extraordinary assumptions\" included zoning and permitting issues as well as the water depth of the docks and its proximity to non-industrial areas. Thus, his testimony supports the highest and best use of the Property to be the layberthing operations that VDP was using the Property for at the time of expropriation. We find his assessment of the condition of the property to be representative of and consistent with the evidence presented as a whole.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   During his testimony, he relied on estimates from the Port's expert engineer, Patrick Flowers and his own appraisal of the land value to formulate a depreciated value of improvements of $23,515,404 and land value of $3,962,000. Although Mr. Oubre stated that in his opinion this valuation was high, we find it is a reasonable estimation for the purpose of determining just compensation. However, when valuing the improvements one of the docks had been omitted. Based on Dr. Ragas' valuation, the depreciated value of the omitted dock was $667,406.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Using the estimates discussed above, we find the record supports an estimated replacement cost after depreciation, of $28,764,685.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Based on the record, we find\n   this to be a credible and accurate valuation of the Property. Accordingly, the trial court's award of just compensation is increased to $28,764,685, together with interest and attorneys' fees as provided for by law. The matter is remanded for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED AS AMENDED AND REMANDED\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-241\">\n    <em>\n     St. Bernard Port, Harbor &amp; Terminal Dist. v.

Second, with respect to the valuation of the land and batture, although the majority recognized the many unique and valuable attributes of the land and batture, it failed to give sufficient weight to these attributes when it accepted the lowest valuation among the four appraisers, contrary to La.

As a result, he had cultivated a network of regular customers who sought out his parking lot in particular for its unique features. He also testified that he had looked for, but had been unable to find, a comparable location to relocate his business.

With respect to the cost method of appraisal, each of the four experts calculated the full replacement cost of the improvements with a deduction for depreciation, plus market value of the land and batture. These cost method amounts were as follows: Michael W. Truax, St. Bernard Port's appraiser, valued at $21,650,000; Bennet Oubre, St. Bernard Port's appraiser, valued at $27,477,404; Heyward M. Cantrell, Violet Port's appraiser, valued at $50,926,443; and Dr. Wade Ragas, Violet Port's appraiser, at $51,500,000.\n    <footnotemark>\n     11\n    </footnotemark>\n    None of the experts performed an analysis under a \"full extent of loss\" standard, pursuant to La. Const. Art. I, \u00a7 4 (B)(5), because this analysis is the function of the courts. The majority failed to perform this analysis in its acceptance of Oubre's cost method of appraisal regularly used for accounting and tax purposes. Although the determination of fair market value by use of the cost method usually includes a reduction for depreciation, our Louisiana Supreme Court has recognized that in expropriation cases, where the property owner is entitled to damages equal to the \"full extent of loss,\" a property may have such unique and irreplaceable characteristics that a reduction for depreciation is not warranted, even though such an award may result in a perceived windfall to the property owner.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    I do not accept any one appraiser's amounts. As recognized by the Louisiana Supreme Court, \"the power of the State and private entities authorized by law to take property competes with the sacred and fundamental rights of citizens to own, control, use, enjoy, protect, and dispose of property.\"\n    <em>\n     Exxon Pipeline,\n    </em>\n    00-2535, 00-2559, p. 18,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11097003\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/788/1154/#p1160\">\n     788 So.2d at 1166\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (J., Knoll, concurring). As such, it is our job as the finder of fact, to balance those competing interests based on all the evidence in the record and the totality of the circumstances.

I disagree with the majority's valuation findings and derive at the total value of the property ($38,017,803) by first estimating the full replacement cost of the improvements without depreciation ($29,000,000) and then adding the market values of the upland ($3,857,238), Plot Y ($35,565), and batture ($5,125,000). I find that these valuations, based on a preponderance of the evidence, reasonably reflect that amount which fully compensates Violet Port \"to the full extent of ... [its] loss\" as required by La. Const. Art. I, \u00a7 4 (B)(5) and as more fully explained below.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      I. BACKGROUND\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    Violet Port owned and operated a 75-acre industrial port facility (\"Violet Port site\") in St. Bernard Parish and was a privately-held family business in operation for over 40 years prior to the quick-taking. The facility utilized two tracts of land located within St. Bernard Parish's levee system: (1) 38.5 acres on the west side of St. Bernard Highway/State Highway 46 (\"upland\") and (2) approximately 4 acres on the east side of the highway (\"Plot Y\"). The Violet Port site also consisted of 12.3 acres of river levee and one mile (4,200 linear feet) of deep-water frontage on the Mississippi River totaling approximately 22 acres located outside the levee (\"batture\"). The batture was on a relatively straight section of the river that was self-scouring.\n    <footnotemark>\n     12\n    </footnotemark>\n    Violet Port's one mile of river-front property was contained within the ten miles of river-front property located in St. Bernard Port's jurisdiction.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    Over many years, Violet Port had built and improved its port facility by reinvesting its profits to construct various site improvements on the property including five steel and concrete docks, numbered 1 through 5.\n    <footnotemark>\n     13\n    </footnotemark>\n    At the time of the quick-taking, Violet Port had a thirty-plus year business relationship with the United States Navy, Military Sealift Command (\"Navy\"), to berth and service ocean-going Navy ships. At the time of the quick-taking, Docks 1, 2, and 5 were used to layberth Navy ships. Dock 4 was being used to further Violet Port's development of its solid bulk cargo operations.\n    <footnotemark>\n     14\n    </footnotemark>\n    Violet Port was actively negotiating with Vulcan Materials, Co. (\"Vulcan\"), a large solid and liquid bulk aggregate company, to establish a business relationship between the two companies. More than a year preceding the quick-taking, Vulcan had approached Violet Port about leasing Dock 4 and ten adjoining acres to transload and store aggregate solid bulk\n    cargo.\n    <footnotemark>\n     15\n    </footnotemark>\n    At the time of the quick-taking, Dock 4's improvements were almost complete. Dock 3 was the only dock that had not undergone extensive renovations in the preceding ten years of the quick-taking and was considered to be in poor condition. Before the quick-taking, Dock 3 could accommodate cranes up to fifteen tons and was used to berth barges, fill water barges, and make some topside repairs.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    At the time of the quick-taking, the Violet Port site's access to river and road transportation enabled Violet Port to use the property for layberthing and topside ship repairs. Further, the property's access to river, road, and rail transportation also enabled Violet Port to use and/or market the property for limited solid bulk cargo operations. The property's access to these three forms of transportation, particularly ships, trucks, and trains, would equally enable St. Bernard Port to use the property for liquid bulk cargo operations. In addition, the property had access to electricity, water, sewerage, natural gas, telephone, docks, and other site improvements, all of which were needed for all types of usage, including layberthing, topside ship repairs, and solid and liquid bulk cargo operations.\n    <footnotemark>\n     16\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    In areas south of New Orleans, private market demand for river access property featuring access to river, road, and rail transportation capable of transloading solid and liquid bulk cargo had grown over the years, exceeding the supply of available properties in St. Bernard Parish. By 2008, St. Bernard Port was operating at full capacity. In its October 2008 \"Strategic Business Plan, 2008-2010,\" St. Bernard Port recognized that \"[l]and on the Mississippi River is finite and already limited. Greenfield sites along the Mississippi River should be considered a national asset for transportation and manufacturing (i.e., the Violet site.)\" With regard to the Violet Port facility, St. Bernard Port stated: \"It is not expected that any significant maintenance expenses will be incurred by the Port during the 10-year period of this analysis.\" In 2009, a personal inspection by an engineer hired by St. Bernard Port indicated that the Violet Port docks and ramps \"appear to be structurally sound and in good shape.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    In late 2008, St. Bernard Port submitted a Port Priority Application (\"PPA\") for funding to the Louisiana Port Construction and Development Program (\"LPCDP\") FY 2009-10 requesting the maximum allowable funding of $15 million from the Port Priority Program. This program is administered by the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development (\"DOTD\"). The $15 million was sought to perform \"Phase 1. Acquisition and Development of the Violet Site.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     17\n    </footnotemark>\n    The 2008 PPA stated that in addition to the $15 million from the Port Priority Funds, St. Bernard Port was contributing $1.66 million in funds and Associate Terminals of St. Bernard, LLC (\"Associated Terminals\") was contributing $1.77 million for equipment acquisition costs, for\n    a total of $18,757,000. Associated Terminals was the private company that already handled most of the cargo operations at St. Bernard Port and eventually took over operations of Violet Port.\n    <footnotemark>\n     18\n    </footnotemark>\n    It was intimately involved in the preparation of the 2008 PPA to acquire and develop Violet Port.\n    <footnotemark>\n     19\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    The 2008 PPA stated:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n    But, from our perspective, we need additional space now to store dry bulk product on the ground, in rail cars, and in barges. The Violet Site offers us the opportunity to do that in\n    <strong>\n     the short term\n    </strong>\n    , with a minimum of capital investment, other than the cost of acquiring the existing facilities. [Emphasis added.]\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    Of specific importance in the 2008 PPA is the statement under the heading of \"Alternatives:\"\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n    In order for the Port to expand its operations on the Mississippi River, it needs additional river frontage and land. This site offers both land and river frontage, plus three existing docks that can be put into use immediately.

It reads:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n    The Violet Docks present a unique opportunity to greatly expand the Port's capabilities with regards to handling bulk cargoes. The St. Bernard area continues to be attractive to importers of bulk commodities due to its location on the river which translates into lower transportation costs. Further, these shippers frequently have the desire to transfer cargo to rail or truck, both of which are possible at the Violet docks.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    Finally, St. Bernard Port stated in pertinent part:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n    The best attribute of this site is that it features three sturdy docks designed to berth some of the largest cargo ships in the world. These docks can be easily modified to support cargo handling operations similar to those currently taking place at the Chalmette Slip, such as ship or barge to truck or rail or to storage.

St. Bernard Port claimed that Violet Port was the\n    <strong>\n     only\n    </strong>\n    site suitable for liquid and solid bulk cargo operations and was \"chosen after due consideration of possible alternative locations, along with related factors including costs, long-range planning, and safety considerations.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    After a lengthy trial, the district court in St. Bernard Parish held that the quick-taking was constitutionally permissible and awarded Violet Port the sum of $16 million to fully compensate it for its loss, the exact amount deposited by St. Bernard Port into the registry of the court.

Testimony Presented by St. Bernard Port\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    St. Bernard Port's first witness was Robert J. Scafidel, Ph.D.,\n    <footnotemark>\n     23\n    </footnotemark>\n    St. Bernard Port's Executive Director since 1998. He testified that St. Bernard Port submitted the 2008 PPA to the LCPDP, \"Development of the Violet Site, Phase I.\" Although St. Bernard Port would be developing the site in three phases,\n    <footnotemark>\n     24\n    </footnotemark>\n    St. Bernard Port was first seeking an initial $15 million from the state to fund Phase I.\n    <footnotemark>\n     25\n    </footnotemark>\n    The application represented that the site had good access over road, rail, and water; it would be great for \"maritime shipping, cargo operations, and stevedoring operations.\" \"With respect to the river, site is located in a gentle curve of the Mississippi, with a moderate to deep water bank line. Further, the property has a favorable location regarding the steerage channel, which is more or less midstream at this location.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    The 2008 PPA also noted that the U.S. Corp of Engineers had permitted Violet Port to moor large vessels, as many as three abreast; it represented that the docks could handle some of the largest cargo ships in the world. It also had electricity, water, natural gas, telephone (six lines per ship), and sewerage on site. As for ancillary facilities, the 2008 PPA stated that these included: interior circular roads; parking lots; security gates; perimeter and interior security fencing for the crews and maintenance personnel aboard the ships; and an office building.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    Scafidel testified that St. Bernard Port would not incur significant maintenance expenses over the next ten years. An inspection,\n    by an engineer hired by St. Bernard Port in January 2009, revealed that three of the docks were structurally sound, in good shape, and could be used immediately as heavy-duty docks.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-97\">\n    In its 2008 PPA, St. Bernard Port described the Violet Port property: \"The acquisition and development of the Violet site is an unusual project, perhaps\n    <strong>\n     unique\n    </strong>\n    within the experience of the Louisiana Port Construction and Development Priority Program.\" (Emphasis added.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-98\">\n    Scafidel stated that St. Bernard Port would be turning the property over to a private entity, Associated Terminals, to operate the site; Associated Terminals ran the St. Bernard Port facility. In addition to cargo services, it would also service the Navy contracts held by Violet Port at the time of the quick-taking.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-99\">\n    St. Bernard Port's next witness was Michael W. Truax, who had a degree in engineering, was a certified real estate appraiser, and accepted by the court as an expert in both. On January 29, 2013, he prepared an update to his original August 27, 2010 appraisal for the valuation of the Violet Port site as of the date of quick-taking, December 22, 2010. In his 2010 appraisal, he appraised the value of the property to be $16 million; this amount did not change in his 2013 revised appraisal. The appraisal was for a \"leased fee\" rather than a \"fee simple\" analysis.\n    <footnotemark>\n     26\n    </footnotemark>\n    However, he stated that a leased fee analysis at market rent is equivalent to a fee simple analysis.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-100\">\n    In his original report, Truax performed a highest and best use analysis. As vacant land, the upland's best use was for industrial development. As for the batture, its potential uses would include construction of a layberth/ship dock facility and construction of a marine service facility. Truax's report stated that the most typical uses for a batture are for development with a ship dock or marine service facility and/or barge fleeting. He believed that Plot Y should be sold separately for speculation.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-101\">\n    As improved, Truax stated that layberthing and topside repairs could continue at Docks 1, 2, and 5. Because Dock 4 was under construction, he did not know if aggregate solid bulk cargo operations could take place there.\n    <footnotemark>\n     27\n    </footnotemark>\n    He was looking for the economic value of the docks and site improvements, which in his opinion was the full replacement cost less depreciation. He testified that the economic value of the site improvements was $290,000 after depreciation. He estimated the replacement cost of the docks to be $30,955,980 before depreciation was deducted.\n    <footnotemark>\n     28\n    </footnotemark>\n    Depreciation\n    of the docks was estimated based on what he called \"an age life premise.\" Using an age life premise of thirty years for the docks, he determined the effective age of each dock and then deducted depreciation arriving at a total of $17,069,269. After adding in his estimate of total site value of $4,580,000 (upland-$2,130,000, including $43,745 for Plot Y; batture-$2,450,000), his total value indication was $21,650,000.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-102\">\n    Truax also applied an income approach to value the property. This is a valuation method whereby one projects the rental income that a property can be derived by being put to its highest and best use. This analysis yielded a property assessment of $12,550,000 to $13,500,000. After looking at the factors and recognizing that appraisals can be somewhat subjective, he concluded that $16 million was a reasonable value.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-103\">\n    The next witness testifying for St. Bernard Port was Bennet Oubre, who was also accepted as an expert in real estate appraisal.\n    <footnotemark>\n     29\n    </footnotemark>\n    Oubre has been an appraiser for all of his career and works through his real estate and brokerage firm, A.R.E. Real Estate Services, where he was the senior appraiser. Oubre was hired by St. Bernard Port to perform three tasks: (1) perform an appraisal review of the August 2010 report prepared by Truax; (2) perform a separate and independent evaluation of the Violet Port site that would conform to just compensation methodologies; and (3) prepare an appraisal review of Violet Port's appraisers. Based on his review of Truax's appraisal and relevant market data available on December 22, 2010, he testified that Truax's appraisal was credible.\n    <footnotemark>\n     30\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-104\">\n    In his report of December 15, 2010, Oubre stated that the highest and best use of the property as vacant land was to \"hold for future marine/industrial development, and as improved to continue its use as a marine lay-berth facility.\" With this in mind, he appraised the land ($1,843,328 for 1,843,328 square feet at $1.00 per square foot) and the batture ($2,119,000 for 4,238 linear feet at $500 per linear foot) totaling $3,962,328.\n    <footnotemark>\n     31\n    </footnotemark>\n    However, later in his testimony, he stated that Dock 4 was designed to accommodate the transfer of aggregate or bulk material from water to the landside. Violet Port already had a permit to install a conveyer system there.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-105\">\n    In terms of full replacement cost of the docks, Oubre admitted that he was relying on numbers provided by both Truax and Dr. Patrick C. Flower, a civil engineer, to arrive at a full replacement cost (direct and indirect) of $38,737,105 for Docks 1, 2, 4, and 5, and general site improvements before depreciation. He stated that only an engineer could determine what it would cost to reconstruct the docks. This amount also included a 10% entrepreneurial incentive of $3,521,555.\n    <footnotemark>\n     32\n    </footnotemark>\n    He further valued the administrative building at $48,000. From the full replacement cost, Oubre deducted $10,898,146 for physical incurable obsolescence\n    <footnotemark>\n     33\n    </footnotemark>\n    and $4,371,055 for functional obsolescence,\n    <footnotemark>\n     34\n    </footnotemark>\n    arriving at total of $23,515,404 as the economic value of the docks or replacement cost less depreciation.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-106\">\n    In his appraisal of December 2010, Oubre stated that, based on his analysis using an income approach, the compensation due as a result of the expropriation of the property was $16 million.\n    <footnotemark>\n     35\n    </footnotemark>\n    His determination of highest and best use was for it to continue as a marine layberth facility with topside repairs and limited bulk material. Oubre thought that the income analysis was stronger than a cost analysis because the former used relevant market data and actual revenues.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-107\">\n    Under cross-examination, Oubre admitted that an appraisal is not based on a mathematical formula. It is an opinion of value; one has to rely on the available data and one's experience. The question then becomes, is the number realistic; is it reasonable within the market data and the parameters one knows about the market? He noted that it was just a coincidence that he and Truax arrived at the same value of $16 million; Oubre believed that the value was reasonable.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-108\">\n    Oubre stated that the intended use of Truax's appraisal was for acquisition, not expropriation; therefore, he used a leased fee interest. Oubre's independent appraisal was of the fee simple value. Oubre agreed that he did an appraisal of the highest and best most profitable use to which the property could be put. In other words, the property is always valued from the highest and best use, its current use does not limit his determination. Contrary to his report, Oubre stated that the highest and best use of the property was \"layberths, some topside repair, and some bulk cargo-bulk material.\" He testified that the demand for aggregate bulk cargo operations was growing and would continue to grow in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-109\">\n    David Fennelly, St. Bernard Port's next witness, was the director of Associated Terminals, a stevedoring and logistics company. Associated Terminals is a separate company that is focused on operations in St. Bernard Parish and its port. As such, it transloads cargo to and from ocean vessels, barges, trucks, and railcars, and stores cargo. It handles non-hazardous dry bulk and break-bulk cargo.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-110\">\n    Fennelly worked with Burk-Kleinpeter, Inc. (\"BKI\") to prepare the 2008 PPA submitted to DOTD by St. Bernard Port. Fennelly helped prepare conceptual designs of the potential uses for the property and provided information relating to the need for the property, market demand, and projected tonnage.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-111\">\n    Although Associated Terminals had not yet been awarded a contract by St. Bernard Port to run the Violet Port facility, it was marketing the facility to prospective users. It had a significant customer base and it had already received inquiries about the potential availability of the site. Associated Terminals had been interested in Violet Port since 2007.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-112\">\n    Fennelly testified that a limitation of Violet Port was its proximity to a neighborhood\n    with a playgrounds and a school. As such, the site could not work with certain types of cargo, such as those producing dust and causing noise. The type of cargos excluded would include coal, petroleum coke, pig iron, and hot briquetted iron.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-113\">\n    Overall, Fennelly stated that Associated Terminals would like to be the leaseholder and operator of the Violet Port site should the right agreement be reached. He testified that as of December 2010, the Violet Port site was adequate for a proposed terminal facility because of the following attributes: (1) access to the river; (2) on stable ground; (3) road access; (4) immediately adjacent to a Norfolk Southern track; and (5) considered \"deep draft.\" It was his belief that the property could be developed to include solid bulk storage and a liquid bulk terminal facility in less than eight to ten years. Fennelly had already discussed with Norfolk Southern Railroad about putting trackage along the property, something in which some of the railroad's clients were interested.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-114\">\n    St. Bernard Port's next witness was Flower, who had an undergraduate degree in civil engineering and a Ph.D. in financial economics. He was self-employed by his own company, Optimum Concept Consulting, LLC. Flower was accepted by the court as an expert in civil engineering, design and construction of marine cargo facilities, as well as replacement costs and condition analyses of same.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-115\">\n    Flower was retained by St. Bernard Port to estimate the value of the docks currently existing at Violet Port. He did this by determining their replacement costs new and then deducted depreciation to come to a final number. Physical depreciation is based on the ratio of expected remaining useful life over useful life. To make this calculation, Flower assigned a useful life of 50 years for each dock,\n    <footnotemark>\n     36\n    </footnotemark>\n    except for Dock 3, which was quite deteriorated. Flower was asked to prepare a replacement cost for the improvements present on December 2010, less curable physical deterioration,\n    <footnotemark>\n     37\n    </footnotemark>\n    incurable physical deterioration, and functional obsolescence. He was not asked to identify any external obsolescence.\n    <footnotemark>\n     38\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-116\">\n    Flower inspected the docks on three separate occasions: November 2010; February 2013; and August 2013. In 2010, Truax gave him blueprints of the docks. His report and testimony were based on a component by component basis and then converted to the dollars per square foot. He developed comparables to disagree with the $450 per square foot for the dock platforms and the $350 per square foot units for trestles that Violet Port's expert engineering company, Lanier &amp; Associates Consulting Engineers (\"Lanier\"), had used. Instead, Flower's prices per square foot were considerably lower, ranging from $120 to $391 per square foot.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-117\">\n    Flower testified that he arrived at unit prices per square foot using the database kept by Kinder Morgan Terminals, in whose building his office is located. Kinder Morgan is the largest solid bulk and liquid bulk terminal operator in the United\n    States, although their primary business is pipelines. Flower had a continuing relationship with its technical and developmental personnel with access to information it compiled.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-118\">\n    Flower calculated the replacement cost and depreciated values of the docks as follows: Dock 1-replacement of $10,025,370 and depreciation of $5,361,470; Dock 2-replacement of $12,686,278 and depreciation of $6,527,378; Dock 3-replacement of $2,669,624 and depreciation of $140,671; Dock 4-replacement of $3,481,000 and depreciation of $2,530,200 (construction not completed at time of analysis); and Dock 5-replacement of $8,406,500 and depreciation of $4,369,700. Thus, according to Flower, the replacement cost of the docks totaled $37,268,772, with a total depreciated value of $18,949,419.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-119\">\n    Flower did not give separate values for mechanical and electrical improvements. These items were included in his total replacement cost for each dock. Under \"soft costs,\" he gave estimates for a conceptual and preliminary phase,\n    <em>\n     i.e\n    </em>\n    ., soil investigation, design, and permits ($266,000), final design and construction ($621,000), and interim interest for construction financing ($266,000).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-120\">\n    Under cross examination, Flower admitted that he was accepted as a cost expert in only one case, however, he was not allowed to testify regarding replacement costs. It had been over 20 years since he had directly supervised the construction of a dock.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-121\">\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      B. Testimony Presented by Violet Port\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-122\">\n    For its first witness, Violet Port presented engineering testimony from Joseph Emile Jacquat, who held both a B.S. and a M.S. in Civil Engineering. He was senior vice president for Lanier where he had worked for about 23 years. His engineering work has consisted of docks, wharfs, and bulkheads on marine projects for a number of companies in Louisiana and Texas, including the Port of New Orleans and the Port of Port Arthur, Texas. Lanier had also worked for St. Bernard Port in the past. Jacquat was accepted by the court as an expert in the field of engineering.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-123\">\n    Lanier began working for Violet Port in 2000 and had worked with Violet Port off and on ever since. He had probably been to Violet Port to see the docks 12-15 times since then. While no renovations to Dock 3 were made, Lanier had performed the required renovations to Docks 1, 2, and 5, for the Navy to park its sealift vessels; Jacquat did not believe that the Navy used Dock 4. He stated that Navy specifications changed over the years so additional renovations were needed. Dock 4 was in the process of being renovated to handle aggregate bulk cargo.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-124\">\n    In mid-July 2010, Lanier was asked by Violet Port to prepare a report on the replacement cost for both the marine and landside items on site. The goal was to determine what it would take to rebuild the various structures in 2010. To do so, a team of engineers, civil/structural, mechanical, and electrical, spent most of a week on site, taking photographs and verifying dimensions of structures, both on shore and offshore. After doing so, the team, along with Jacquat, assembled that information into tabulated values and items. For unit costs, cost data was compiled from ongoing projects at Violet Port and recent projects at other facilities on which Lanier was working.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-125\">\n    In Jacquat's report, the replacement costs were broken down into three categories: civil/structural, mechanical, and electrical. No depreciation was applied. The total estimated marine terminal cost using replace-in-kind values are as follows: Dock\n    1-$15,656,678; Dock 2-$22,030,156; Dock 3-$6,095,168; Dock 4-$6,308,950; Dock 5-$10,244,672; General Facility-$5,091,341; and Equipment/Mechanical-$3,571,881. Because Violet Port was \"robustly designed and well-constructed, [was] well maintained and experienced relatively low repetitive wear, it was reasonable to expect that a useful life of the facility will be 60 years or more.\" The report also stated that the facility had an average of 70% to 80% remaining service life and with continued proper maintenance, a useful life of 60 years could be achieved.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-126\">\n    On cross-examination, Jacquat admitted that his team did not perform an inspection of the docks in 2010. The approximate $68 million replacement cost was based on a unit cost per square foot for the trestle and the apron and the other features that were at the facility. The unit price used for the dock aprons of Docks 1, 2, 4, and 5 was $450 per square foot and the unit price for the trestle of all five docks was $350 per square foot. The prices per dock did not vary. He used prices from comparable projects in the office; he spoke to project managers and pulled out the costing information from recent bids. Jacquat conceded that each dock was designed differently and had different numbers and sizes of piles with different wall thickness.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-127\">\n    Violet Port's next witness was Randolph Carmichael, an urban planner. His career has focused on economic development. He began working at BKI in 1980. Shortly after joining the firm, Carmichael was assigned to the St. Bernard Port, which was created in 1981. St. Bernard Port was one of the firm's clients; he worked with St. Bernard Port until his retirement in June 2011.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-128\">\n    Carmichael helped prepare the 2008 PPA for the Violet Port site on behalf of St. Bernard Port. The proposed use was a multi-purpose terminal for the movement of solid and liquid bulk products. It took him months to prepare the application; BKI engineers assisted him. He also met with Associated Terminals two or three times to explore the site's possibilities.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-129\">\n    The attributes of the Violet Port site that made it suitable for its proposed use included: (1) 4000 or more feet on a relatively straight section of the river; (2) deep water access; (3) some existing docks could be used relatively quickly; (4) access to road and rail; (5) a favorable steerage channel; (6) utilities,\n    <em>\n     i.e\n    </em>\n    ., water, gas, electrical, telephone, and sewerage; (7) heavy industrial zoning; (8) ability to berth some of the largest cargo ships in the world; and (9) fenced secure areas with paved parking.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-130\">\n    Carmichael also noted in the 2008 PPA that substantial commercial utility was found in the upland 38 acres and 22 acres of batture. It stated that\n    <strong>\n     \"a strategic analysis led to the conclusion that the site best [highest and best use] leant itself to the transfer and storage of solid and liquid bulk commodities.\"\n    </strong>\n    In reaching this conclusion, the application stated that the site was unique. The built drawings obtained from Lanier revealed that the docks had a live load design of 450 pounds per square foot, but that mats placed under cranes could further increase the load capacity in a cost-effective manner. The application also stated that the docks were personally inspected by a BKI engineer who indicated that the docks and ramps appeared to be structurally sound and in good shape. Carmichael also agreed that a number of physical improvements would be needed at the Violet Port site and that the application presented a phased development of the property that could take a number of years.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-131\">\n    Carmichael also prepared and signed the 2009 Supplemental Report. The purpose of the supplemental report was to\n    provide additional information after he met with two representatives from the Port Priority Program. With regard to the Navy leases, the St. Bernard Port stated that it would continue to service the existing ones and compete for additional contracts.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-132\">\n    Heyward M. Cantrell, a certified general appraiser, was the next witness presented by Violet Port. He had been an appraiser for over 40 years and owned his own company, Cantrell Real Estate. He was accepted by the district court as an expert in real estate appraisal.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-133\">\n    Cantrell was hired by Violet Port to perform an appraisal of the property and improvements as of December 22, 2010. He testified that he had considerable experience appraising port properties in Louisiana and Florida. He determined that the highest and best use of the property was continued layberthing along with a bulk commodities terminal.\n    <footnotemark>\n     39\n    </footnotemark>\n    He recognized that the conceptual drawings by St. Bernard Port also included a liquid commodities terminal, but did not include that in his highest and best use determination.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-134\">\n    Cantrell's highest and best use analysis looked at the property as both vacant and improved and as physically possible, legally permissible, financially feasible, and maximally productive. He concluded that the highest and best use of the batture as vacant was for dockage of deep water vessels engaged in international shipping of bulk commodities.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-135\">\n    Applying the same type of analysis to the upland, he determined that the highest and best use as vacant was for the storage of solid bulk and nonhazardous liquid bulk commodities brought to and from the site on deep draft vessels and barges as well as railroad and highway transportation. As improved, he found that Dock 2, under a long-term lease with the Navy, should continue as such. However, he thought the remaining property would be best served by transitioning into bulk commodities storage with highway and railroad access. This conclusion was confirmed by an agreement to lease the property by Vulcan dated March 12, 2010. This was an option agreement that would allow Vulcan to lease portions of the property as an aggregate distribution facility.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-136\">\n    Cantrell stated that total for land and depreciated improvements was $50,926,443.\n    <footnotemark>\n     40\n    </footnotemark>\n    The amount of $8,211,000 was the total of his estimate of the land ($3,860,000 as rounded), the batture ($4,200,000), and Plot Y ($151,000).\n    <footnotemark>\n     41\n    </footnotemark>\n    Cantrell included \"indirect costs\" of permitting and other legal expenses ($500,000), construction financing interest ($2,208,160), and construction financing costs ($981,404).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-137\">\n    He used a replacement cost approach method with regard to the property's improvements and arrived at $76,028,182 before depreciation. Cantrell then applied a rate of depreciation based on the age and construction of the dock, using a useful life of 60 years.\n    <footnotemark>\n     42\n    </footnotemark>\n    As for the cost of the docks,\n    Cantrell adopted the numbers as determined by Lanier. Cantrell admitted that he submitted a revised report lowering the value of Plot Y after he obtained new zoning information from St. Bernard Parish authorities.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-138\">\n    Cantrell included 10 percent for entrepreneurial incentive ($6,911,653);\n    <footnotemark>\n     43\n    </footnotemark>\n    he was the only appraiser who did. Both Truax and Oubre said no market evidence existed that someone would pay a premium for the property. However, looking at a brand new facility (full replacement costs), Cantrell stated that a buyer would be willing to pay a bonus to receive a facility that it would neither have to develop nor build what is already there.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-139\">\n    Cantrell also increased his calculation of depreciation from $18,216,764 to $33,312,740 based on Oubre's review of his report and additional information from the owners of Violet Port. These two changes decreased his original appraisal by $15,000,000. Cantrell believed that this different methodology better reflected the market than his initial analysis. Thus, his depreciated value of the docks was $50,993,000.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-140\">\n    Cantrell made two \"extraordinary assumptions\" when determining the highest and best use of the property in order to value it correctly; these were identified in his revised report. To make an extraordinary assumption, one must have a reasonable basis for the assumption of an unknown fact.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-141\">\n    One assumption was that the depth of the water was 50-60 feet; he relied on information from the owners, but did not independently check the depth. He acknowledged that soundings performed by the Corp of Engineers published in 2003 indicated a depth of 45 feet. Cantrell did not know if that depth was correct in 2010. Cantrell stated that a depth of 45 feet would not change his calculation of value.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-142\">\n    The other assumption was that the Corp of Engineers and/or the Levee District of St. Bernard Parish would issue the requisite permits to allow solid bulk and nonhazardous liquid material to be transported over the levee. He spoke with St. Bernard Parish to learn that the upland area could be used to store products and materials, assuming that the materials were nonhazardous.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-143\">\n    In coming to the conclusion that the highest and best use of the property is bulk cargo operations, Cantrell noted that Vulcan, one of the largest aggregate dealers in the world, was highly interested in an agreement to locate at Violet Port. It certainly was why St. Bernard Port wanted the property. Therefore, the proposed use for the property was neither speculative nor unreasonable.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-144\">\n    The next witness was Daniel Dieudonne, one of the owners of Violet Port. He began working at Violet Port in the early 1990's. Before that, his father ran the day-to-day operations. At the time of the quick-taking, Dieudonne was the president and general manager. He testified that Violet Port was involved in various projects such as, topside and some bottom-side repairs, bid on government contracts, and some cargo operations. He also described the layberthing services being provided to the Navy, something Violet Port had been doing for many years.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-145\">\n    In December 2010, Violet Port was actively renovating and updating Dock 4 in anticipation of signing a lease with Vulcan to start handling increasing amounts of\n    aggregate bulk cargo. All renovations and updates ceased upon the quick-taking.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-146\">\n    Violet Port also presented the testimony of Dr. Wade Ragas, an appraiser with a Ph.D. in finance. The court accepted Ragas as an expert in real estate appraisal. Ragas prepared an initial report. However, after reviewing the appraisals by Truax and Oubre, he revised his estimates. Ragas acknowledged that this was a complicated appraisal assignment and that experts' opinions could differ about many of its components.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-147\">\n    In performing his job, Ragas visited the site at least six times. To begin a valuation of the land, batture, and Plot Y, he was required to arrive at the highest and best use of the property. In his revised report dated January 30, 2013, he stated in pertinent part:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-148\">\n    Violet Dock is a special purpose property best suited for multiple bulk cargo (dry and liquid) plus existing contracts with the U.S. Navy MSC for layberth and servicing of large, medium-speed roll-on/roll-off Navy cargo ships (contract to 2018)[.]\n    <footnotemark>\n     44\n    </footnotemark>\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-149\">\n    After issuing his initial report, Ragas found five different matters he wanted to reevaluate. The first had to do with nonlinear depreciation. He decided that more depreciation was warranted than what he had originally taken. In this regard, he consulted again with the engineers. The second issue was that of the effective age being used by St. Bernard Port's appraisers. The third issue was the measure of width in one of the comparables used. He could not get a survey performed, so Ragas used 1,660 feet in width at the water line; this altered the price per foot.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-150\">\n    The fourth issue had to do with the fact that no appraiser had submitted any comparable sales commensurate with the existing docks. As a result, he allowed for a 10% bulk sale discount and deducted that from his total valuation. Finally, he understood that water depth was a matter of dispute when earlier he thought it was not. While he changed his report to reflect an average depth of 45 feet from the 50-60 feet he was originally told, it did not affect his total valuation of $51,500,000. This amount represented a depreciated amount of the docks and site improvements, his values for the land and batture, less the bulk sale discount.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-151\">\n    Ragas testified that he first looked to as much information he could gather about market conditions and demand for facilities that might include docks. He came to the conclusion that he was dealing with a bulk cargo-type property; that such use was likely. He used the engineering expertise of Lanier believing that it was a reasonable expert on this property and other maritime facilities.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-152\">\n    Ragas then searched comparables and used those that he thought were most appropriate, although he admitted that none were on point. In this way, he came to the conclusion that the indicated value of the batture at about four and one-half million. Next, he looked at the upland and tried to ascertain landside industrial uses.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-153\">\n    As did other appraisers, Ragas analyzed the highest and best use of the property both as vacant and improved. He stated that the vacant site's best use was as \"a multimodal import and export bulk cargo dry and liquids shipping site particularly\n    well suited for 900 foot or longer ships with a beam up to 160 feet. The site can also support topside repair berths and numerous configurations of barge tow berthing.\" As improved, the site's highest and best use would be for general bulk cargo transfer, topside repair, layberth and specialized cargo facilities and aggregate bulk transfer. Of course, the site would continue to dock and layberth the Navy ships pursuant to the lease currently in place.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-154\">\n    In arriving at his numbers, Ragas followed generally accepted appraisal principles. Normally one uses comparables to value land, but none seemed to be available. He stated that the same issue arose for all the appraisers. He believed that an income approach to value would be inappropriate for this property; he used a cost analysis. As he interpreted their reports, all the appraisers agreed that Violet Port was a special-use property.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-155\">\n    Violet Port's next witness was Paul Simmons, president and general manager of Boland Marine and Industrial (\"Boland\"). He also became a shareholder of Violet Port in 2009 and sits on its Board of Directors.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-156\">\n    Before the quick-taking, Violet Port was in the business of providing berthing for vessels, ship repairs, and some cargo operations. In the year or two preceding the taking, Violet Port was expanding its docks and looking into increasing its cargo business. Immediately before the taking, Violet Port was poised to enter into a contract with Vulcan to provide Dock 4 as an aggregate terminal. To accomplish this, improvement efforts were focused on Dock 4 and the necessary permits had been obtained.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-157\">\n    Simmons testified that it would have cost millions of dollars to relocate in order to continue to service the Navy's ships as it had done so for many years. Although Violet Port looked, it found no available sites that would meet the Navy's specifications.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-158\">\n    Violet Port recalled Scafidel, St. Bernard Port's Executive Director, to the stand. He was familiar with the document entitled, \"Dock Rehabilitation Industrial Renewal and Expansion of Facilities Status Report on Ongoing Projects,\" prepared by St. Bernard Port in March 2006. St. Bernard Port referred to the Violet Port site as one of the last major properties on the Mississippi River suitable for cargo trans-shipping. In November 2008, it claimed that Violet Port was the only remaining site in St. Bernard that could be a deep draft marine terminal.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-159\">\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      C. Rebuttal Testimony by St. Bernard Port\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-160\">\n    St. Bernard Port presented two of their appraisers as rebuttal witnesses after Violet Port rested its case: engineer Truax, and appraiser Oubre. Both were questioned about the conclusions by appraiser Ragas; Oubre was also questioned about appraiser Cantrell's reports and testimony.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-161\">\n    In summary, Truax criticized Ragas' report in many respects, including: (1) his batture value was too high; (2) Ragas claimed to have used Truax's numbers to conform his valuation but did not property utilize Truax's allocations; and (3) Ragas did not use the entirety of Truax's report, but instead picked and chose information to support his conclusions. Truax also testified that the Violet Port site was not unique, he properly valued the entire site at $16 million, and that other properties existing on the Mississippi River could be modified at or less than that amount to service the Navy contracts.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-162\">\n    On cross-examination, Truax admitted that he neither used any of the information contained in St. Bernard Port's 2008 PPA to acquire the Violet Port site nor utilized the reports by Oubre and engineer Flower.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-163\">\n    Oubre testified that he prepared appraisal reviews of the appraisals by Cantrell and Ragas and found them not to be credible for a number of reasons.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-164\">\n    With regard to Ragas, Oubre stated that he did not believe that the appraisal satisfied the intended use. He also stated that the report included personal business property, which was inappropriate. Oubre found that Ragas made several assumptions that he would consider \"extraordinary.\" These are assumptions that are unknown but presumed to be true. These must be necessary to achieve a credible value appropriate of the intended use; have a reasonable basis; and result in a credible analysis and value opinion. These extraordinary assumptions are: St. Bernard Parish would issue the necessary permits for intensive bulk cargo operations; the Corp of Engineers would likewise issue the requisite permits for solid and/or liquid cargo operations at docks other than Dock 4; the water depth was at least 45 feet; the Mississippi River would dredge to 50 feet; and that the docks were strong enough to berth fully-laden cargo vessels and intensive cargo loading and offloading.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-165\">\n    He also stated that Ragas did not adjust his values by functional obsolescence; his valuation is based on new constructs rather than on market value estimates, thus, his estimate of $73 million new without depreciation was not credible. Ragas based his valuation on future uses of the property, not on the activities at the time of expropriation.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-166\">\n    With regard to Cantrell's appraisals, Oubre noted that valuation in his initial report was between $63-$64 million, his revised report gave a valuation of about $51 million, and testified that the value was about $40 million. As for extraordinary assumptions, Cantrell's were similar to those made by Ragas.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-167\">\n    Under cross-examination, Oubre agreed that all appraisals are opinions and judgment calls.

As recognized by the majority, Violet Port's business ceased to exist when the property was taken. St. Bernard Port admits to the uniqueness of the property for purposes to expand its bulk cargo business. Its own expert, Oubre, on whom the majority relies to support its award, stated that the property was unique; a \" 'special use property' with highly specialized improvements.\" St. Bernard Port concedes that the Violet Port property was the \"only piece of property in the entire parish, along the Mississippi River that could serve as a deep draft marine terminal.\" Consequently, the law provides that Violet Port is entitled to full replacement value as an award from this court.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-195\">\n    This conclusion is further supported by the majority's finding that the facility and business operations were highly specialized. Many improvements were made on the property so it could service Navy\n    ocean-going ships, including installing transformers, a potable water supply, six telephone lines per ship, and a boiler for steam. In addition to the mechanical and electrical support for the ships, numerous landside improvements were performed to comply with Navy specifications.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-196\">\n    Just compensation for the taking of property that is \"both unique in nature and location and also indispensable to the conduct of the property owners' business operations\" is the\n    <strong>\n     full replacement costs of the improvements without a depreciation deduction.\n    </strong>\n    <footnotemark>\n     52\n    </footnotemark>\n    <em>\n     Constant,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9619233,9619455\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/369/699/\">\n     369 So.2d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    706 ;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Orleans Parish Sch.

The record demonstrates that the two experts for St. Bernard Port (Oubre and Truax) and the two experts for Violet Port (Cantrell and Ragas) testified as to the value of the land and batture.

Oubre and Truax placed a low value on the land and batture, determining values of $3,962,000 and $4,580,000, respectively; whereas, Cantrell and Ragas placed values of $8,211,000 and $11,470,000, respectively.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-205\">\n    In essence this was a battle of the experts on their valuations based on an analysis of attributes, assumptions, and usages associated with the land and batture.

All experts struggled to find comparable sales due to the unique attributes of Violet Port's land and batture. However, the experts all agree that the land and batture, without taking into consideration the improvements, and looking at it as vacant land, have the following two extraordinary unique attributes: (1) direct access to river, road, and rail transportation and all utilities and (2) one mile (4,200 LF) of relatively straight batture on the Mississippi River, which is deep-water, self-scouring, and totals approximately 22 acres outside the levee. The experts also agree that access to river and road transportation is necessary for the use of layberthing and topside ship repairs and that access to river, road, and rail transportation is necessary for the use of the property for solid and liquid bulk cargo operations. The property's access to all types of utilities was necessary for all types of usage.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-209\">\n    The majority's opinion correctly lays out a description of Violet Port's property with respect to the various mechanical and electrical support and public utilities available in the neighborhood adjoining or on the site included electricity, water, natural gas, telephone, and sanitary sewer. What the majority omits, however, are the many unique locational and physical attributes of the land and batture. These include: (1) over 4,200 LF of straight batture of near 45 or more feet in water depth; (2) self-scouring water depth; (4) location within a four-hour sail of the mouth of the Mississippi River; (5) location across from anchorage\n    and at a river width with suitable use as a turning basin; and (6) the site was zoned I-2 Heavy Industrial District, a liberal zoning classification that would permit general industrial, warehouse, and storage, including certain open or enclosed storage of products, materials, and vehicles. These attributes among others are what attracted St. Bernard Port to the Violet Port site in the first place.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-210\">\n    Moreover, all the experts recognized the unique attributes of the batture. I find that St. Bernard Port's experts fail to properly value the batture in accordance with these attributes and its obvious scarcity. Even St. Bernard Port admitted that this is the only piece of property on the river that was suitable for its immediate and future plans. Thus, I accepted Ragas' value of the batture.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-211\">\n    With respect to assumptions made by the experts, I do not place great weight on Oubre's criticism of Ragas' valuation of the batture. Oubre was concerned in what he called \"extraordinary assumptions\" made by Ragas when arriving at his determination of \"highest and best use.\" First, Oubre questioned the assumption that St. Bernard Parish would issue the requisite permits for intensive bulk operations. However, Cantrell testified that he spoke with parish personnel who indicated that the upland could be used to store products and non-hazardous materials. Next, Oubre questioned Ragas' assumption that the water depth was at least 45 feet. Evidence in the record supports Ragas' conclusion. Oubre's criticism that the Mississippi River would dredge to 50 feet was again a concern unsupported by the record. Fennelly of Associated Terminals testified that one of the attributes of the Violet Port site was that it was \"deep draft.\" Finally, I find Cantrell's assumptions as to the land reasonable and consistent with St. Bernard Port's experts.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-212\">\n    With respect to \"highest and best use,\" the district court found that the property's \"highest and best use\" was for layberthing with limited cargo operations.\n    <footnotemark>\n     62\n    </footnotemark>\n    Normally, this finding is reviewed under the manifest error standard. However, upon remand, we are reviewing the record\n    <em>\n     de novo\n    </em>\n    and making a determination based on the preponderance of the evidence in the record.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-213\">\n    The record reflects that the testimony of urban planner, Carmichael, who helped prepare the 2008 PPA for the Violet Port site on behalf of St. Bernard Port, and the 2008 PPA revealed that\n    <strong>\n     \"a strategic analysis led to the conclusion that the site best [highest and best use] leant itself to the transfer and storage of solid and liquid bulk commodities.\"\n    </strong>\n    <footnotemark>\n     63\n    </footnotemark>\n    I find that St. Bernard Port cannot, in good faith, argue that the site's \"highest and best use\" is something less than what it stated in its application.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-214\">\n    It is highly important to again quote St. Bernard Port in its evaluation of the Property\n    <strong>\n     before\n    </strong>\n    the quick-taking in 2010 and why it wanted this particular piece of land. In 2008, the St. Bernard Port recognized that \"[l]and on the Mississippi River is finite and already limited. Greenfield sites along the Mississippi River should be considered a national asset for transportation and manufacturing (i.e., the Violet site.)\" In its 2008 PPA, St. Bernard Port noted that the Violet Port site would allow it to expand its storage of solid bulk cargo on the ground, in rail cars, and in barges immediately. In the 2009 Supplemental Report, St. Bernard Port noted that \"shippers frequently have the desire to\n    transfer cargo to rail or truck, both of which are possible at the Violet docks.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-215\">\n    The law is clear that St. Bernard Port cannot now argue that the \"highest and best use\" of the property is layberthing, a position that \"flies in the face of its prior public position\" made a part of the record.\n    <em>\n     Natchitoches Parish Port Comm'n v.

Unlike an expropriation for levee improvements, roads, bridges, drainage servitudes, and other similar public purpose projects, where governmental agencies, such as public ports, possessing power to quick-take private property and compete with private industry, courts should use heightened scrutiny and analysis when balancing the rights of private ownership with the state's rights to expropriate property for a public purpose. Moreover, a governmental agency's fiscal ability to ultimately pay a just compensation award in a quick-taking suit is not a factor that courts are allowed to consider.

From the property owner's point of view, it was essential to continue the business in that he was not ready to retire and had expected to continue his business at the old plant indefinitely. The facility required little maintenance and he had adequate storage if the business expanded. Finding no replacement facility in New Orleans, they purchased another property in Jefferson Parish and built a new facility. The improvements were basically a duplication of the old facility, consisting of large storage tanks, warehouse, loading dock, paving, and fencing. The property owners' position was that the only appropriate method of valuation was the actual cost of replacement, undiminished by any allowance for depreciation of the expropriated property. In order to be fully compensated for their loss, they argued that they be awarded total land acquisition and construction costs, financing costs, and income foregone from other assets which they liquidated to pay for the new facility. The defendants' appraisers testified that the site purchased was the only available property with the correct zoning, M-2 heavy industrial. No improved property existed to which the property owners' operation could move. One appraiser stated that because of new rules and requirements a larger site was required to produce the same storage capacity.
