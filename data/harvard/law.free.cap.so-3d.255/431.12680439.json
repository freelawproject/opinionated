The trial court's order denied Quintero's motion, and directed Quintero to show cause why he should not be precluded from further pro se filings in lower court case number F08-32265. We affirm the denial of Quintero's rule 3.800 motion. We dismiss, as premature, Quintero's appeal regarding that portion of the order requiring him to show cause, without prejudice to Quintero separately appealing any final order entered below precluding him from further pro se filings in the trial court in this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Spencer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11455565\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/751/47/#p48\">\n    751 So.2d 47\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 48-49 (Fla. 1999) (\"[P]roviding notice and an opportunity to respond through the issuance of an order to show cause ... serves to generate a more complete record. If the litigant is thereafter denied further pro se access to the courts, the appellate courts will have an enhanced ability to determine whether the denial of access is an appropriate sanction under the circumstances.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Affirmed in part, dismissed in part.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
