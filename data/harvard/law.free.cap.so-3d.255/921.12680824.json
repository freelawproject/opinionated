Hart replied that requiring him to serve his aggregate fifty-year sentence without judicial review after twenty years would violate the Eighth Amendment. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    I.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Hart was charged with carjacking, kidnapping, aggravated battery with a deadly weapon, armed robbery, and two counts of sexual battery. He was fifteen years old when he committed the offenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The testimony at trial established that Hart's first victim was walking home around 5:00 p.m. on January 5, 2007, when Hart approached her from behind, grabbed her arm, and put what she assumed to be a gun to her back. He took the victim to a wooded area, where he ordered her to remove her clothes. Over the course of the next forty-five minutes, Hart repeatedly hit the victim with his gun and raped her vaginally, orally, and anally. After he finished, Hart kept the victim's shirt, bra, and cell phone as \"souvenirs\" before running off. During the incident, Hart struck the victim so hard on her head with his gun that she lost consciousness. When the victim finally received medical attention, she required multiple stitches for a wound on her forehead and was required to wear a neck brace.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   A few hours after he raped the first victim, Hart and his cousin approached a second victim who had arrived at her father's home around 10:20 p.m. Because her father's home had a long driveway inside a closed gate, the victim had to exit her car to open the gate. The end of the driveway was well lit by a street light. When she exited her vehicle, Hart and his cousin were standing nearby, holding guns. The men pointed their guns at her and demanded her car, her keys, her cell phone, and her purse. The victim gave Hart and his cousin what they wanted and they drove off. The carjacking occurred approximately one block from where the first victim was raped.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The jury convicted Hart of sexual battery, battery as a lesser-included offense of sexual battery, kidnapping, aggravated battery with a deadly weapon, armed robbery, and carjacking. The trial court sentenced Hart to concurrent terms of life in prison on the sexual battery, armed robbery, and carjacking convictions; one year on the battery conviction; thirty years on the kidnapping conviction; and fifteen years on the aggravated battery conviction. Hart appealed, arguing that the charges involving the two victims were improperly joined and should have been separately tried. This Court agreed, reversed Hart's convictions, and ordered separate trials on remand.\n   <em>\n    Hart v.

The trial court sentenced Hart to concurrent thirty-year sentences for sexual battery and kidnapping and to a consecutive sentence of twenty years' imprisonment for carjacking, for an aggregate term of fifty years in prison.

Hart does not. Although Hart was sentenced to life imprisonment in 2009, Hart's convictions and life sentences were vacated on grounds that the joinder of his trials involving the two victims was improper, and he was granted a new trial.\n   <em>\n    Hart I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7024517,7024591\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/70/615/\">\n    70 So.3d at 620\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . On remand in 2013, Hart entered a negotiated plea and agreed to be sentenced to an aggregate term of fifty years' imprisonment. Thus, for purposes of our analysis, we look to the sentence imposed for his 2013 convictions, not the life sentences imposed for his vacated 2009 convictions. Applying the definition of the class of offenders entitled to relief under\n   <em>\n    Henry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Kelsey II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Lee\n   </em>\n   , we conclude Hart is not entitled to relief because he was never resentenced pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Nor can Hart demonstrate that his fifty-year aggregate sentence violates\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   .
