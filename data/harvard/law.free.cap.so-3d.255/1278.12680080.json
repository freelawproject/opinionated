James Owens had been experiencing drug-withdrawal symptoms when he wandered off his work shift onto a dark Louisiana highway. Around this time, Will Gates was driving his employer's truck, which struck Owens. Gates did not see Owens, and the truck never left its lane of travel. Owens\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   filed a negligence suit in Humphreys County, Mississippi, against Gates and his employer. The case proceeded to trial, and the jury returned a verdict in favor of Gates and his employer. After review, we find the evidence supported the jury's verdict that Will Gates had not been negligent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2. We also find no merit to Owens's claim that the judge wrongly denied his request for a mistrial based on Gates's cousin Abraham Gates, a justice court judge, acting as a jury consultant in his case. This case was a civil jury trial in\n   <em>\n    circuit\n   </em>\n   court, not justice court, and all Owens can show is that Judge Gates sat in the courtroom during trial. Like the circuit-court judge, we fail to see any grounds for a mistrial. Had Judge Gates been an attorney, he could have tried the case for the defense.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   So his serving as a jury\n   consultant-a role that involved no direct contact or interaction with the jury-was not prohibited.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 3. Moreover, the circuit-court judge allowed Owens's counsel to address the issue of Judge Gates's attendance during voir dire. And the entire venire assured the court that any knowledge of Judge Gates would not impact its ability to be impartial. So the circuit-court judge did not abuse her discretion when she denied Owens's motion for a mistrial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 4. Therefore, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    Background Facts and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I. The Accident\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 5. On September 23, 2013, Will Gates was driving an eighteen-wheeler for his employer, Total Transportation of Mississippi, LLC. Around 8:25 p.m., he pulled out of the Folgers Distribution Center in St. Tammany Parrish, Louisiana, onto Highway 434 where his truck struck Owens.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 6. Owens was a temporary worker at Folgers who had walked off his shift without clocking out. Owens testified he left because he was not feeling well. But he had an admitted history of illegal drug use. And his live-in girlfriend, Aleisha Mills, testified that Owens had left because he was experiencing heroin withdrawal. Owens had called Mills multiple times from work. Mills testified Owens asked her to bring him some heroin so he could make it through his shift that did not end until midnight. When she finally arrived at Folgers with the drugs, Owens had left his shift, exited the Folgers facility, and walked onto the narrow, almost nonexistent shoulder of Highway 434.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 7. Gates's truck had only traveled a quarter to a third of a mile from Folgers when it hit Owens. Gates testified that, when he pulled out, no one was on the highway. Gates did not see Owens before impact and figured he must have stepped out in front of him. The accident report admitted into evidence similarly concluded that Owens had stepped into the highway, because Gates's truck never left its lane of travel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 8. Gates was traveling at twenty miles per hour when he struck Owens. Owens presented an accident reconstructionist who opined that, at that speed with proper headlamps, Gates should have been able to see Owens for several seconds before impact. Owens's theory was that Gates must have been distracted. Owens's counsel questioned Gates about his cell phone records, which indicated he had made a call within a minute or so of calling 911 to report hitting Owens. But Gates insisted he was not on the phone and had not been distracted when the accident occurred. Instead, he had tried to call a family member before he left the Folgers facility. And only after she did not answer did he pull out onto Highway 434.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 9. According to the accident report, that stretch of Highway 434 was dark. And Owens was wearing dark clothing. But several witnesses-including Owens-said he had been wearing a non-reflective, orange mesh work vest.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 10. Owens survived but sustained a head injury. After initial hospitalization, he was transferred to a neurological rehabilitation\n   living center. Through his conservator Charles Fairley, Owens sued Gates and Total Transportation for negligence,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   alleging the collision caused permanent injuries, including brain damage. Though Owens had a poor work history before the accident, he claimed the accident rendered him unable to work. His doctors also testified his injury impeded his ability to fight his drug addiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Trial\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 11. While Owens was injured in Louisiana, he decided to file his negligence complaint in Humphreys County, Mississippi, where Gates resided. Trial began in Humphreys County on July 27, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 12. Sitting in the courtroom during trial was Gates's cousin, Justice Court Judge Abraham Gates. Defense counsel retained Judge Gates to consult on jury selection. At first, Judge Gates sat at defense counsel's table. But Owens's counsel objected. Because Judge Gates was not an attorney, the trial court directed him to sit outside the well. But the court found no issue with his serving as a jury consultant, since Judge Gates was a part-time judge who was allowed to perform other jobs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 13. At this point, voir dire had not been completed. And the trial court decided the best way to handle Owens's counsel's concern about Judge Gates was to give counsel the opportunity, which he took, to ask the venire if Will Gates's relationship to Judge Gates and Judge Gates's presence at trial would impact their impartiality. The potential jurors collectively responded that they either knew or knew of Judge Gates. But they all assured Owens's counsel and the court that they could still be impartial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 14. Only after the first day of trial testimony, which included Will Gates's being called adversely, did Owens's counsel move for a mistrial based on Judge Gates's \"participation\" in the trial. The trial judge denied the motion, finding Judge Gates's introduction to the jury panel as the defendant's cousin and mere attendance at trial did not warrant a mistrial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 15. Trial testimony lasted about a week. The jury heard from Gates, Owens, Mills, Owens's coworkers, the first responders and eyewitnesses to the accident, accident reconstructionists, and medical experts. Because the accident occurred in Louisiana, the parties submitted-and the trial court gave-jury instructions based on Louisiana substantive law. Following deliberation, the unanimous jury found Will Gates had not been negligent in the operation of his truck the night he hit Owens. Based on the jury's verdict, the trial court entered a judgment for the defendants. Owens filed a notice of appeal, but his notice was not effective until his Rule 59 motion to alter the judgment or, alternatively, for a new trial was denied almost a year following trial. Miss. R. Civ. P. 59(e), (a) ; Miss. R. App. P. 4(d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 16. On appeal, Owens takes aim at the jury's verdict. He claims the defense verdict contradicted the evidence and Louisiana law. He further asserts the jury was biased by evidence of Owens's drug use and improperly influenced by Judge Gates. But Owens's claims miss their mark. And what Owens is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   arguing is almost as important in resolving this appeal as what he\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   arguing. Instead of pinpointing specific trial court rulings that were reversible error, Owens provides several variations on a broad argument that the jury simply got it wrong. But our well-established law \"requires [this Court] to give great deference to the jury's verdict and the trial\n   judge's refusal via post-trial motions to set aside the jury verdict or award a new trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Patterson v. Liberty Assocs., L.P.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8925453\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/910/1014/#p1020\">\n    910 So.2d 1014\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1020 (Miss. 2004). Because Owens fails to show any abuse of discretion in the circuit court's denial of the motion to alter the judgment or a new trial, we affirm the judgment in favor of Gates and Total Transportation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    I. The Law and the Evidence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 17. Owens first argues the jury's verdict was contrary to Louisiana substantive law and the overwhelming weight of the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     A. Louisiana Law\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 18. Importantly, Owens does not argue the circuit court improperly instructed the jury on the law. Both parties agreed Louisiana substantive law would control, because the accident occurred in Louisiana.\n   <em>\n    But see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ford v. State Farm Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7494418\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/625/792/#p794\">\n    625 So.2d 792\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 794 (Miss. 1993) (citing\n   <em>\n    Boardman v. United Servs. Auto. Ass'n\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7621245\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/470/1024/\">\n    470 So.2d 1024\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Miss. 1985) ) (applying the \"center of gravity\" test-of which the location of the accident is but one factor to consider-to determine whether the substantive law of Mississippi or Louisiana applied). And Owens makes no claim that any of the standard-of-care instructions were erroneously given or erroneously denied based on Louisiana law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 19. Still, Owens insists the jury's finding that Gates had not operated his truck negligently contradicted Louisiana law. Owens cites\n   <em>\n    Turner v. New Orleans Public Service Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7617267\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/476/800/#p805\">\n    476 So.2d 800\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 805 (La. 1985), for the principle that a motorist bears greater responsibility than a pedestrian to prevent a collision between them. But\n   <em>\n    Turner\n   </em>\n   dealt with how to assess fault when\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   the motorist and pedestrian struck by the vehicle were found to be negligent. In that case, a city bus ran over Musette Turner's foot.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Though the trial court awarded her full damages, the Louisiana Supreme Court reduced her award by ten percent to account for her own negligence, which contributed to her injury.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7617267\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/476/800/#p805\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7617267\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/476/800/#p805\">\n    at 805\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"Turner's fault was that she walked almost into the path of an approaching bus, slipped and fell when she tried to save herself.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7617267\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/476/800/#p805\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   However, \"Turner's fault was slight\" when \"[c]ompared to the [bus] driver's fault[.]\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7617267\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/476/800/#p805\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \"The driver failed to see a pedestrian on a collision course with his bus, at an intersection where he knew passengers transferred from one bus to another.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7617267\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/476/800/#p805\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Further, there was no reason why the driver could not see her. A passenger sitting near the driver saw her.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7617267\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/476/800/#p805\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7617267\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/476/800/#p805\">\n    at 802\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And if the driver had only \"seen her in the crosswalk too he could easily have avoided the accident.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7617267\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/476/800/#p805\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7617267\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/476/800/#p805\">\n    at 805\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Louisiana Supreme Court assessed the driver ninety percent of the fault, concluding: \"The greater the risk of harm to others, the greater is the fault.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7617267\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/476/800/#p805\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 20. By contrast, here, the jury found Gates had not been negligent at all. Thus, he did not share any fault for the accident-let alone the lion's share like the bus driver in\n   <em>\n    Turner\n   </em>\n   . While Owens argues assessing zero fault to a motorist contradicts Louisiana law, Louisiana does \"not impose absolute liability on a driver of an automobile simply when there is a collision between a car and a person.\"\n   <em>\n    Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. v. Nero\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9536987\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/425/730/#p733\">\n    425 So.2d 730\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 733 (La. 1983). Instead, \"[t]he operator of a motor vehicle must ... be at fault in order to be held liable.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9536987\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/425/730/#p733\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 21. For example, in\n   <em>\n    Johnson v. Safeway Insurance Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11566352\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/741/32/#p34\">\n    741 So.2d 32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 34 (La. Ct. App. 1999), the Louisiana Court of Appeals reversed a judgment assessing a\n   motorist fifty percent fault and entered a judgment in his favor. Significantly, the appellate court recognized the principle that Owens relies on in this appeal-that, while both motorist and pedestrian owe a duty of care, \"a far greater duty and responsibility to avoid the accident is placed upon the motorist, who is 'insulated' inside his machine and has the greater chance of avoiding the accident[.]\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11566352\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/741/32/#p34\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11566352\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/741/32/#p34\">\n    at 33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Even so, based on the facts, the court held that the pedestrian in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   was the only one who breached her duty of care. The pedestrian had been walking with two friends \"down the middle of an unlit highway with their backs to any traffic in their lane\"-leaving \"no doubt\" she had been negligent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11566352\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/741/32/#p34\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11566352\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/741/32/#p34\">\n    at 33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . By contrast, the motorist was driving below the speed limit, had to contend with the headlights of oncoming vehicles, and did not see the teenager walking in the street until the cars passed. At that point, there was no evidence that it would have been physically possible for him to avoid the accident.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11566352\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/741/32/#p34\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11566352\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/741/32/#p34\">\n    at 34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because the motorist was not proven negligent, the appellate court reversed the judgment assessing him fifty percent fault and entered judgment in his favor.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11566352\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/741/32/#p34\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 22. Likewise in\n   <em>\n    Bink v. Blackwell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9528774\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/429/228/\">\n    429 So.2d 228\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (La. Ct. App. 1983), the Louisiana Court of Appeals affirmed a trial court's finding that a pickup truck driver who hit a woman walking alongside the road at night was not at fault. Like Owens, the pedestrian in\n   <em>\n    Bink\n   </em>\n   argued the truck driver could have avoided the accident and, thus, was at fault.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The appellate court disagreed, finding it was \"by no means clear that the [driver],\" who was traveling at a safe speed, \"should have seen the [pedestrian],\" who had been wearing dark clothing and walking on the side of the road in the same direction as oncoming traffic.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9528774\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/429/228/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9528774\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/429/228/\">\n    at 231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 23. Here, the evidence supports the jury's conclusion that Owens, and only Owens, breached his duty of care. Like the motorist in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   , Gates was traveling slowly and did not see Owens in time to avoid the accident. By contrast, like the pedestrian in\n   <em>\n    Bink\n   </em>\n   , Owens was walking in the lane of travel of an unlit highway, with his back to oncoming traffic and wearing dark clothing. So the jury's verdict is consistent with factually similar cases applying Louisiana law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B. Weight of the Evidence\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 24. The jury's verdict is also supported by the evidence. On appeal, Owens argues the overwhelming weight of the evidence showed Gates had been distracted \"almost certainly from using his cell phone while driving.\" But this argument dismisses both the evidence that Gates had not been distracted and the evidence Owens was struck in the lane of travel as simply not credible. However, credibility determinations are made by the jury, not an appellate court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 25. This Court has been clear that, \"[w]hen testimony is contradicted\"-as it was here-\"this Court will defer to the jury, which determines the weight and worth of testimony and the credibility of the witness at trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Venton v. Beckham\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9131645\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/845/676/#p684\">\n    845 So.2d 676\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 684 (Miss. 2003) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Odom v. Roberts\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7476032\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/606/114/#p118\">\n    606 So.2d 114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 118 (Miss. 1992) ). Indeed, this Court \"will show great deference to the jury verdict by resolving all conflicts in the evidence and every permissible inference from the evidence in the appellee's favor.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7476032\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/606/114/#p118\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The jury heard conflicting evidence about Gates's cell-phone usage and alertness at the time of the accident. There was also conflicting evidence about whether Owens had been wearing an orange vest over his dark clothing and about where he was standing when he was struck. When these conflicts are resolved in Gates's favor, the jury's verdict is supported by the record and is not against the overwhelming weight of the evidence. Therefore, the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Owens's motion to alter the verdict or, alternatively, for a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Owens's Drug Use\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 26. Owens also claims the jury's verdict was \"improperly influenced by something other than the admitted evidence.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 27. The first supposed \"improper influence\" is Owens's history of drug use.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Owens claims the defense emphasized his substance abuse \"to deliberately appeal to the biases and prejudices of the jury.\" Owens\n   <em>\n    concedes\n   </em>\n   his history of drug use was relevant to the question of Owens's own negligence and the extent and causation of his injuries. Yet he argues the defense improperly used this relevant evidence to inflame the jury against him. He points to Mississippi Rule of Evidence 403, arguing \"[e]ven where relevant, this type of evidence should be excluded if its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\" But he fails to cite anywhere in the record where he asked the trial judge to exclude certain evidence of his drug abuse under Rule 403.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 28. Owens broadly asserts that two defense witnesses, Mills and Dr. Mark Webb, \"served virtually no other purpose than to inundate the jury with inflammatory, cumulative, and improper evidence.\" However, Mills's testimony that Owens now claims was particularly offensive-her testimony \"about completely irrelevant domestic incidents and criminal charges\"-was given\n   <em>\n    without objection\n   </em>\n   . And while Owens did lodge a\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   challenge to Dr. Webb's expert testimony, his objection was that Dr. Webb, a forensic psychiatrist, should not be allowed to rebut his experts, a neurologist and neuropsychologist.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   He did not object at trial to the portion of Dr. Webb's testimony concerning Owens's drug use as unfairly prejudicial under Rule 403.

This issue was simply not preserved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 29. The only specific objection Owens cites in his brief was his objection to Dr. Webb's testifying about one of Owens's medical reports. This report had been prepared by another psychiatrist, Dr. Peter Camp. And he insists that report was unreliable to form the basis of Dr. Webb's expert opinion. But the trial court\n   <em>\n    sustained\n   </em>\n   this objection. And Dr. Webb was prohibited from testifying about Dr. Camp's report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b6 30. While Dr. Camp's report later was admitted into evidence, the trial court ruled it was admissible as part of Owens's medical records, which Owens himself had authenticated. We discern no reversible error in the admission of Dr. Camp's report or any other evidence of Owens's substance abuse. Both Owens and his team of experts corroborated his history of drug addiction. And Owens does not deny this evidence was relevant. Therefore, it was admissible.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Miss. R. Evid. 402.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Justice Court Judge Abraham Gates\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b6 31. Owens also takes issue with Judge Gates's serving as a jury consultant for the defense. Owens argues Judge Gates not only served as a jury consultant, but also his role as a part-time judge improperly benefitted his cousin, in violation of the Mississippi Code of Judicial Conduct. In fact, the only law Owens cites are Canons 1 and 2B of the Code of Judicial Conduct.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   But the Code of Judicial Conduct \"is designed to provide guidance to judges ... and to provide a structure for regulating conduct through disciplinary agencies.\" Miss. Code of Judicial Conduct Preamble (2018). This is not a judicial-discipline proceeding against Judge Gates. It is an appeal of a jury verdict in a civil trial. And as the Code itself cautions, its designated purpose \"would be subverted if the Code were invoked by lawyers for mere tactical advantage in a proceeding.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7477000\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/604/306/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Instead of articulating how the judge who presided over his trial reversibly erred, it appears Owens is trying to invoke the Code-against a non-presiding judge outside of that judge's court-as a means to gain a new trial where he otherwise is not entitled to one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b6 32. For example, Owens claims the circuit judge, the Honorable Jannie Lewis, should never have allowed Judge Gates to \"participate\" in the trial. But as Judge Lewis recognized, Judge Gates was allowed as a part-time judge \"to practice law or any other profession or occupation.\" Miss. Code of Judicial Conduct Terminology (2018). Had Judge Gates been an attorney, he could have\n   <em>\n    tried\n   </em>\n   the case for the defense. So we fail to see why his position as justice court judge precluded him from attending trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b6 33. Owens also, without citing any authority, claims Judge Lewis should have granted his motion for a mistrial. Uniform Rule of Circuit and County Court Practice 3.12 does permit the trial court to grant a motion for mistrial if a party, a party's attorney, or someone acting at the behest of the other party or party's attorney engages in misconduct, inside or outside of the courtroom, that substantially and irreparably prejudices the movant's case. URCCC 3.12. In reviewing Owens's mistrial claim, the question is not, as Owens's frames it, whether Judge Gates engaged in \"misconduct\" that would subject him to judicial discipline. Instead, the question is did the trial judge abuse her discretion when she found no mistrial was warranted based on the jurors' responses to voir dire as to Will Gates's relationship to Judge Gates and any impact Judge Gates's presence would have on their impartiality.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b6 34. Owens's complaint that his case was substantially and irreparably prejudiced by Judge Gate's \"physical presence in the courtroom\" has no support in the record. The trial judge addressed the issue of Judge Gates's presence during voir dire the day before Owens moved for mistrial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ross v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8337690\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/954/968/#p988\">\n    954 So.2d 968\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 988 (Miss. 2007) (\"In general, a voir dire is presumed sufficient to ensure a fair and impartial jury.\"). During voir dire, all venire members responded affirmatively when asked if they knew or knew of Judge Gates. But as this Court has observed, in rural counties like Humphreys County, Mississippi, \"it [is] not unusual for potential jurors to know parties and witnesses in trials\" and \"finding jurors with no knowledge of the case or the parties [can be] difficult.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Payton v.

Moreover, counsel followed up by asking if Judge Gates's presence would influence the jurors' decision.

However, the overarching principle is that this Court defers to the trial judge's ruling on a motion for a mistrial. Because a \"trial judge is in a better position to assess the effect of incidents which may require a mistrial than is this Court on appeal, ... this Court will not reverse on the failure to grant a mistrial unless the judge abused [her] discretion in overruling the motion for a mistrial.\"\n   <em>\n    Cavett v.
