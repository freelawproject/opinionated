We affirm without discussion that portion of the final judgment entered in favor of plaintiff Ben-Shmuel on his claim for unjust enrichment. However, we hold that the trial court erred in denying Levy's motion for involuntary dismissal, because Ben-Shmuel failed to meet his burden of proving damages at the nonjury trial. We therefore reverse that portion of the final judgment entered in favor of Ben-Shmuel on his claim for conversion, and remand with directions to enter a final judgment in favor of Levy on that claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   We also write to clarify the law within this district, and hold, as a general rule, that where this court determines, on appeal from a properly preserved claim, that a party failed to meet its burden of establishing the correct measure of damages at trial, that party is not entitled on remand to a new trial on damages, unless that party's failure to meet its burden was the result of judicial error.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Levy and Ben-Shmuel were longtime friends when they agreed that Levy would temporarily move into a furnished home owned by Ben-Shmuel in Golden Beach, Florida. The rental agreement was not in writing, and according to the allegations of the complaint, the parties agreed that the rental rate was $27,000 per month but that, in lieu of rent, Levy would instead maintain and make certain improvements to the property during the rental term. The complaint alleged that Levy moved into the property on September 4, 2012, but did not maintain the property, never made any improvements, and failed to pay any rent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After Levy vacated the premises, Ben-Shmuel sued him, alleging claims of,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , unjust enrichment and conversion of personal property allegedly removed by Levy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The claims proceeded to a bench trial. The court found in favor of Ben-Shmuel on the claims for unjust enrichment and conversion of personal property. Thereafter, the court entered final judgment in favor of Ben-Shmuel, and against Levy, awarding Ben-Shmuel $90,000 as damages on the unjust enrichment claim (three months' rent at $30,000 per month) and $15,000 as damages on the conversion claim. Levy\n   moved for rehearing, but that motion was denied. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ANALYSIS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   As stated earlier, we affirm without discussion that portion of the final judgment awarding $90,000 to Ben-Shmuel on his unjust enrichment claim, and address only that portion of the final judgment awarding Ben-Shmuel $15,000 in damages for Levy's conversion of personal property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On appeal, and at the trial court,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Levy contended that Ben-Shmuel failed to meet his burden of establishing damages for his conversion claim. Although Ben-Shmuel opposed Levy's contention at the trial court, Ben-Shmuel concedes on appeal that he failed to establish the correct measure of damages for his conversion claim. Nevertheless, Ben-Shmuel posits that we should reverse and remand for a new trial to permit Ben-Shmuel a second opportunity to prove his damages on the conversion claim. Levy contends that no new trial should be permitted and that we should reverse and remand with instructions to enter final judgment in favor of Levy on this claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   We agree with Levy and hold that, because Ben-Shmuel failed to meet his burden of establishing the correct measure of damages at trial, and such failure was not the result of judicial error, Ben-Shmuel is not entitled to a new trial on damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The generally prevailing rule is that a party will not be permitted a new trial on remand to remedy its own failure to present sufficient evidence to support its claim.

In each of these cases we determined that the plaintiff had failed to meet its burden of establishing the proper measure of damages, and reversed the final judgment, but remanded for a new trial on damages. However, these two decisions are devoid of any discussion, analysis or rationale for affording the plaintiff a second opportunity to prove damages at a new trial.
