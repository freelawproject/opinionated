('the child') by the child's maternal grandmother, D.T. ('the adoptive parent'). In July 2015, W.G. ('the paternal grandmother') filed a petition seeking an award of grandparent visitation with the child pursuant to Ala. Code 1975, \u00a7 26-10A-30. The paternal grandmother did not request that a summons be issued or serve the adoptive parent with the petition by certified mail as required by Rule 4(a)(1), Ala. R. Civ. P. Instead, the paternal grandmother served the petition on the adoptive parent as one would serve a motion under Rule 5, Ala. R. Civ. P., by mailing a copy of the petition to the attorney who had served as the adoptive parent's counsel in the adoption proceeding. After a hearing, which the adoptive parent did not attend, the probate court entered a judgment on November 2, 2015, awarding visitation to the paternal grandmother.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   (Footnotes omitted.) We dismissed the adoptive parent's appeal in\n   <em>\n    D.T.\n   </em>\n   based on our conclusion that the November 2, 2015, judgment was void because the paternal grandmother had not properly instituted her action and had not properly served the adoptive parent.\n   <em>\n    D.T.\n   </em>\n   , 255 So. 3d at ----.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After the issuance of our opinion in\n   <em>\n    D.T.\n   </em>\n   , the paternal grandmother instituted a new action seeking grandparent visitation under Ala. Code 1975, \u00a7 26-10A-30, and properly served the adoptive parent. The adoptive parent answered the complaint; in her answer, she included a constitutional challenge to \u00a7 26-10A-30. The probate court held a trial on the paternal grandmother's complaint on August 9, 2016, after which it entered a judgment on September 29, 2016, awarding the paternal grandmother visitation with the child. On October 6, 2016, the adoptive parent filed a postjudgment motion, which the probate court denied. The adoptive parent timely appealed the September 29, 2016, judgment to this court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The trial testimony was either not recorded or not transcribed. Pursuant to Rule 10(e), Ala. R. App. P.,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   the parties have submitted, and the probate court has approved, an agreed statement of the case. The facts contained in the statement of the case are as follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The paternal grandmother testified that she was present at the birth of the child in September 2008 and that she visited with the child every other weekend during the first six months of the child's life. According to the paternal grandmother, she had offered financial assistance to the child's parents by supplying them with diapers, wipes, food, and clothing for the child. The paternal grandmother also said that she babysat the child at her home during the day and, on occasion, overnight during the early months of the child's life. After the child's parents, who had lived together but were not married, separated, the paternal grandmother said, the mother and the child had lived in the home of the mother's great-grandmother. The paternal grandmother testified that she had continued to assist the mother with the needs of the child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In March 2010, when the child was approximately 18 months old, the adoptive parent sought and was granted custody of the child through the Tuscaloosa Juvenile Court. Since that time, the adoptive parent said, the child has resided with her. The adoptive parent formally adopted the child in 2013. At the time of the child's adoption, the child's father was incarcerated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The paternal grandmother testified that she had hosted birthday parties for the child each year until 2013. She also testified that she had been allowed overnight visits in her own home with the child until January 2012. After the adoption was finalized, the paternal grandmother testified, the adoptive parent began to severely limit her access to the child. During 2013 and 2014, the paternal grandmother said, the adoptive parent allowed only six visits with the child; two of those visits were two-hour supervised visits in the adoptive parent's home. According to the paternal grandmother, after September 2014, the adoptive parent refused to allow the paternal grandmother to visit with the child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The paternal grandmother testified that her last unsupervised visit with the child was on the child's fifth birthday in 2012. According to the paternal grandmother, when she was returning the child to the adoptive parent's home, she told the child that she might not be able to visit with her for a long time. The paternal grandmother said that the child responded by stating that she \"could pack a bag, climb out her window and the [paternal] grandmother could come pick her up.\" The paternal grandmother said that she had discouraged the child's idea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The paternal grandmother moved from Demopolis to Louisiana in 2013 for employment-related reasons and to care for her ailing father. The paternal grandmother does not own a home in Louisiana and lives with her fianc\u00e9. She testified that the child's father is no longer incarcerated and that he is in a rehabilitation program. She stated that \"she would 'absolutely not' restrict access to the child by her biological father during her visits.\" She also said that she intended to reunite the child with her father at some point in the future. The paternal grandmother stated that she would be present when the child visited with the father.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The adoptive parent explained that she had discontinued overnight visits with the paternal grandmother after the child had told her that, when she had become scared one night, she had gone into the paternal grandmother's bedroom, where the paternal grandmother was in bed with a man to whom the paternal grandmother was not married. The adoptive parent said that the paternal grandmother had admitted that the man had been in her bed and that he had been in her home during other overnight visits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The adoptive parent said that she had several concerns about allowing the paternal grandmother unsupervised or overnight visitation with the child. She expressed discomfort with the fact that the paternal grandmother lives in another state and about the paternal grandmother's cohabitation with a man to whom she is not married. The adoptive parent also testified that she did not want the child to have contact with her father. The adoptive parent admitted that she had \"blocked\" the paternal grandmother's telephone number because the adoptive parent had become frustrated over the paternal grandmother's continual text messages requesting telephone visitation with the child and the paternal grandmother's refusal to \"take 'no' for an answer.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The probate court made the following factual findings in its judgment:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \"[The child] was born on September 18, 2008, to [the biological mother] and [the father] [ (referred to collectively as 'the natural parents') ].

While the ... child was under the care and custody of her [biological] mother, [the paternal grandmother] visited [the child] every other weekend, assisted the ... child's natural parents financially, provided babysitting services during the day and overnight, gifts, and paid for necessities, such as food, diapers, wipes, and clothes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   \"In or about 2010, it became evident that the ... child's natural parents could not provide the necessary care to the ... child. [The adoptive parent], without objection from the [the paternal grandmother],\n   obtained custody of the ... child through the Tuscaloosa County Juvenile Court. After [the adoptive parent] was awarded custody, [the paternal grandmother] continued to see the ... child on a regular basis and continued to provide emotional and financial support to the ... child. [The paternal grandmother] hosted the ... child's birthday parties at [her] home every year until 2013. The testimony of the [adoptive parent] and [the paternal grandmother] clearly established that [the paternal grandmother] had a close and loving relationship with the ... child that benefited the ... child.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   \"In 2013, unbeknownst to the [paternal grandmother], [the adoptive parent] filed a petition in this Court to adopt the ... child. This Court granted the adoption in Case No. PC-2013-700 on November 12, 2013. After [the adoptive parent] became the ... child's adoptive parent, [she] refused to allow [the paternal grandmother] to maintain her relationship with the ... child. [The adoptive parent] refused to respond to text messages from [the paternal grandmother] seeking to talk to and visit with the ... child for weeks. [The adoptive parent] also blocked [the paternal grandmother's] [tele]phone number because [the adoptive parent] believed that the text messages from [the paternal grandmother] were 'annoying' and because [the paternal grandmother] 'refused to take \"no\" for an answer,' when it came to [her] requests to see her granddaughter.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   \"[The adoptive parent] offered no evidence to support her decision to cut-off [the paternal grandmother's] long-standing relationship with the ... child. Nor did [the adoptive parent] offer any evidence that having a relationship with [the] paternal grandmother ... would not be in the ... child's best interest. Furthermore, [the paternal grandmother] is the only connection the ... child has to the paternal side of her family and familial relationships are beneficial to the ... child.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On appeal, the adoptive parent asserts four arguments. She first contends that the probate court erred by not appointing a guardian ad litem for the child. She next argues that \u00a7 26-10A-30 is unconstitutional, both facially and as applied to her. Finally, the adoptive parent complains that the probate court's decision to award visitation to the paternal grandmother is not supported by clear and convincing evidence that such visitation would be in the child's best interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   We will first consider the adoptive parent's arguments regarding the constitutionality of \u00a7 26-10A-30. Although she argues that the statute is both facially unconstitutional and unconstitutional as applied to her in this particular instance, the adoptive parent's arguments regarding constitutionality are premised almost entirely on the principle that she, as the child's parent, has the fundamental right to the child's care, custody, and control, which right the United States Supreme Court, in Troxel v. Granville,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413198\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/57/#p73\">\n    530 U.S. 57\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 73,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413198\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/57/#p73\">\n    120 S.Ct. 2054\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413198\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/57/#p73\">\n    147 L.Ed.2d 49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2000), concluded had been violated by a Washington statute allowing third parties to seek visitation with a child over the objection of the child's parent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The\n   <em>\n    Troxel\n   </em>\n   Court concluded\n   that the judgment awarding visitation under the Washington statute amounted to an \"unconstitutional infringement on [the parent's] fundamental right to make decisions concerning the care, custody, and control of her [children].\"\n   <em>\n    Troxel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413198\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/57/#p73\">\n    530 U.S. at 72\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413198\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/57/#p73\">\n    120 S.Ct. 2054\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, as admitted by the adoptive parent, our supreme court has already rejected the argument that \u00a7 26-10A-30 is unconstitutional based on the holding in\n   <em>\n    Troxel\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ex parte D.W.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9329546\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/835/186/\">\n    835 So.2d 186\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Ala. 2002). Our supreme court explained in\n   <em>\n    Ex parte D.W.\n   </em>\n   that \u00a7 26-10A-30 did not violate the principles articulated in\n   <em>\n    Troxel\n   </em>\n   because the adoptive relationship is a status created by statute and, thus, that the legislature is free to define the rights of adoptive parents as it sees fit, even to the extent of limiting those rights to allow for the possibility of court-ordered visitation with grandparents in certain instances.\n   <em>\n    Ex parte D.W.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9329546\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/835/186/\">\n    835 So.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   190-91 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Weathers v.

Civ. App. 1998) (stating that, in enacting former Ala. Code 1975, \u00a7 26-10-5, the predecessor statute to \u00a7 26-10A-30, the legislature \"acknowledge[d] an exception to the general rule that an adoption order that terminates the rights of the natural parents also terminates the rights of the natural grandparents\"). Although the adoptive parent argues that \"a large body of law has evolved that makes clear that Ex parte\n   <em>\n    D.W.\n   </em>\n   was wrongly decided,\" this court is bound by the holding of\n   <em>\n    Ex parte D.W.\n   </em>\n   , and we are therefore not at liberty to reach the conclusion that the adoptive parent urges.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ala. Code 1975, \u00a7 12-3-16 (\"The decisions of the Supreme Court shall govern the holdings and decisions of the courts of appeals ....\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The adoptive parent also contends that the fact that the statute places jurisdiction over such visitation issues in the probate court, which, she says, is not a court of record\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"in Tuscaloosa County,\" fails to protect her due-process right to meaningful review of the evidence. She rests her argument on one citation to authority:\n   <em>\n    M.L.B. v. S.L.J.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11594972\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/519/102/#p107\">\n    519 U.S. 102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 107,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11594972\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/519/102/#p107\">\n    117 S.Ct. 555\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11594972\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/519/102/#p107\">\n    136 L.Ed.2d 473\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1999), in which the United States Supreme Court determined that a parent appealing the termination of his or her parental rights cannot be denied meaningful review of that judgment by a requirement that he or she prepay the costs of compiling the record on appeal.\n   <em>\n    M.L.B.\n   </em>\n   is inapposite. The adoptive parent has appealed and, as provided for in Rule 10(e), has presented an agreed statement of the case in lieu of a transcript of the proceedings. The adoptive parent has provided no authority demonstrating how the probate court's jurisdiction over adoption matters has deprived the adoptive parent of any of her rights to due process. We are not required to perform that research for her.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brooks v. Brooks\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8203289\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/991/293/#p303\">\n    991 So.2d 293\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 303 (Ala. Civ. App. 2008) (\"[I]t is neither our duty nor our function to perform legal research for an appellant.\"). We conclude, therefore, that she has not convincingly demonstrated\n   that the legislature's choice to place adoptions and ancillary matters under the jurisdiction of the probate court renders \u00a7 26-10A-30 unconstitutional as applied to her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The adoptive parent next argues that \u00a7 26-10A-30 is unconstitutional as applied to her in the present case because, she says, the probate court violated her right to due process by considering ex parte communications with the paternal grandmother during the proceedings leading up to the entry of the November 2015 judgment that we reversed in\n   <em>\n    D.T.\n   </em>\n   Although a court's consideration of ex parte communications might violate a party's due-process rights,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ex parte R.D.N.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8993418\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/918/100/#p105\">\n    918 So.2d 100\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 105 (Ala. 2005), we cannot see how a court's inappropriate consideration of ex parte communications would compel the conclusion that a\n   <em>\n    statute\n   </em>\n   was unconstitutional as applied. In any event, the adoptive parent did not make any argument to the probate court that its judgment was based on improper ex parte communications. Thus, we cannot further consider the adoptive parent's argument that the probate court violated her due-process rights by engaging in what the adoptive parent characterizes as \"ex parte communications\" when the paternal grandmother gave testimony at the earlier trial in this matter or otherwise communicated with the probate court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    M.G. v.

R. Civ. P.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The adoptive parent filed a motion seeking the appointment of a guardian ad litem for the child on August 5, 2016, four days before the date set for trial.

Because the supreme court ordered that the children be made parties to the action, Rule 19(a) would require appointment of a guardian ad litem for them. The child in the present case is not a party to the action; nor does the adoptive parent argue that the child is a necessary or indispensable party to the action.

The adoptive parent admits that \u00a7 26-10A-30 does not indicate the burden of proof imposed upon the party seeking visitation under that statute.

According to its judgment, the probate court found that, based on the evidence presented, the paternal grandmother and the child had \"a close and loving relationship ... that benefited the ... child\" until late 2013. The probate court also noted that the paternal grandmother was the only connection the child had to her paternal relatives and found, consistent with Weathers, that \"familial relationships are beneficial to the ... child.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The adoptive parent contends that the probate court improperly placed on her the burden of proving that visitation with the paternal grandmother would not be in the best interest of the child. Indeed, the probate court's judgment states that the adoptive parent had not \"offer[ed] any evidence that having a relationship with [the] paternal grandmother ... would not be in the ... child's best interest\" and had \"offered no evidence to support her decision to cut off [the paternal grandmother's] long-standing relationship with the ... child.\" Although we understand why the adoptive parent might believe that these statements indicate that the probate court was, in fact, requiring her to establish a basis to deny the requested visitation, we cannot agree that the probate court placed the burden of proof on the adoptive parent. Instead, it appears that the probate court concluded that the paternal grandmother and the child had enjoyed a close, loving relationship, that that relationship was a benefit to the child, and that the adoptive parent had not presented evidence satisfying the probate court that her decision to terminate that relationship was warranted or necessary. Thus, we read the judgment as concluding that an award of visitation to the paternal grandmother was warranted because of the close, loving, and beneficial relationship that the child had enjoyed with her, that the relationship should be allowed to continue so that the child could maintain a connection with her paternal relatives, and that no evidence indicated that the child's best interest would be better served by denying the requested visitation.

The paternal grandmother appears to admit that the motion was, in fact, denied, and no order appointing a guardian ad litem is contained in the record. Thus, for purposes of this opinion, we will consider the motion seeking appointment of a guardian ad litem for the child as having been denied.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    Rule 17(c) permits a court to \"make any other orders it deems proper for the protection of the minor\"; however, the rule does not require that such an order be entered.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    Former \u00a7 30-3-4.1, a general grandparent-visitation statute, was declared unconstitutional in\n    <em>\n     Weldon v.
