The State deposited what it felt was just compensation into the registry of the court. The citizen, after a jury trial, was awarded more than the amount deposited by the State. The State appeals the jury's verdict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n    </em>\n    :\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendant, Kerry Lane Moreau (\"Moreau\") owns 1.653 acres located at 7053 Highway 1 in Avoyelles Parish, Louisiana. After purchasing the property in 1992, he constructed a convenience store with gas pumps. Behind the convenience store, Moreau erected eighty-four to eighty-six mini-storage units to maximize the full use of his property. Moreau has continually operated these businesses since 1992.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In the fall of 2011, pursuant to a plan to expand State Route LA 1, The State of Louisiana, Department of Transportation and Development (\"DOTD\") proposed to expropriate a portion of Moreau's property totaling 0.183 acres in full ownership and 0.131 acres in temporary servitude. DOTD utilized the services of Michael Allen Graham, Jack Green, Jr., John David Mowad, and Jody Morvant to estimate the just compensation for the partial taking of Moreau's property. Subsequently, DOTD\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   attempted to negotiate with Moreau for the purchase of Parcels 1-11 and 11-1-C-1 bordering his property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The negotiations failed because Moreau demanded additional compensation of $805,278.00 for the partial taking because the taking forced elimination of fueling operations from his property, rendering the property unfit for its intended use. This figure included the value of the land and improvements, in part, taken, severance damages to the remainder, cost to cure, and lost earnings. It did not, however, include a claim for relocation costs, nor for damages pursuant thereto.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Consequently, DOTD filed a petition for expropriation seeking judgment declaring the proposed portion of Moreau's property expropriated. In conjunction with the filing of the petition, DOTD deposited $672,268.00 into the registry of the court as an estimate of compensation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Pursuant to the court's scheduling order and consent judgment, pretrial memoranda, including jury instructions, were submitted by the parties. Moreau also filed an amended pretrial memorandum. Neither of Moreau's submissions included a proposed jury instruction regarding relocation or relocation damages. On the morning of the trial, Moreau submitted a new proposed jury instruction regarding relocation and relocation damages. Over DOTD's objection, the trial court accepted the new instruction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   While the matter was pending, in an effort to mitigate his damages as a result of the taking, Moreau was forced to convert his convenience store into a package liquor store. At trial, Moreau's financial expert, Patrick Lacour, opined that a package liquor store is a much less desirable business and is much less marketable to outside purchasers. Moreover, Moreau's relocation expert, Ronnie Rabalais, opined that the total replacement cost to move Moreau's business and reestablish it at another location, including land value taken from one of DOTD's appraiser's reports, would be $1,097,090.00. This figure was the only figure adduced at trial by any expert regarding the cost of relocation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   When Moreau rested, DOTD moved for a directed verdict pursuant to La.Code Civ. P. art. 1810. The trial court denied this motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   At the conclusion of the jury trial, the jury returned a unanimous verdict in favor of Moreau in the amount of $972,628.00 as just compensation while leaving the alternative award portion blank. The trial court then sent the jury back into deliberations in order to fill in each blank on the form. The jury then returned a verdict awarding Moreau the alternative award of $1,197,090.00 as relocation damages. The trial court granted Moreau a judgment reflecting the jury's verdict. It is from this judgment that DOTD appeals and presents four issues for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ISSUES PRESENTED FOR REVIEW\n    </em>\n    :\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   1.

On the day of the trial, Moreau asserted a relocation claim, which had not previously been pled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   After agreement between the parties, the trial court modified the pre-trial order by providing in the jury verdict form alternative verdicts: one for just compensation damages for the part taken, or, in the alternative, one for relocation damages, if the jury deemed it appropriate. As such, the trial court found that Moreau had a right to pursue the claim for relocation as an alternative award to just compensation under the typical expropriation laws. However, the trial court refused to allow DOTD's expert rebuttal witness to testify against the relocation claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In sum, the defendant was allowed to ambush the plaintiff with an entirely new theory of recovery and allowed to present new evidence in support of that theory, even though this evidence had not been approved in the pretrial order, and the trial court prohibited the entrance of new evidence in opposition to that theory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Given the above, we find that the trial court abused its discretion to modify the pretrial order to provide for an alternative award for relocation damages. In addition, we find an abuse of discretion in allowing Moreau's expert to testify in support thereof, but not allowing DOTD's expert to rebut that testimony. Accordingly, we find merit in this issue presented for review, and we reverse the trial court's modification of the pretrial order and the jury's award of relocation damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   This finding renders moot several errors alleged by DOTD.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ISSUE PRESENTED FOR REVIEW NUMBER TWO\n    </em>\n    :\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In its second issue, DOTD contends that Moreau failed to meet his burden of proof that he is entitled to increased just compensation by failing to present any competent evidence or expert testimony to establish the value of the land taken or severance damages to the land remaining in excess of the amount deposited. As such, DOTD alleges that the trial court erred in denial of its motion for directed verdict on this issue. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   A trial court has much discretion in determining whether[ ] to grant a motion for directed verdict. A motion for directed verdict is appropriately granted in a jury trial when, after considering all evidentiary inferences in the light most favorable to the movant's opponent, it is clear that the facts and inferences are so overwhelmingly in favor of the moving party that reasonable men could not arrive at a contrary verdict. However, if there is substantial evidence opposed to the motion, that is, evidence of such quality and weight that reasonable and fair-minded jurors in the exercise of impartial judgment might reach different conclusions, the motion should be denied, and the case submitted to the jury.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   On appeal, the standard of review for directed verdicts is whether, viewing the evidence submitted, the appellate court concludes that reasonable people could not reach a contrary verdict.

That was the suggestion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   This testimony from DOTD's expert can reasonably be found to establish that the partial taking completely eliminated the intended use of the property, a convenience store selling gasoline.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   At the conclusion of the trial, the jury was instructed to consider each expert opinion received into evidence, and to give it such weight as they thought it deserved. Further, the jury was instructed that they were not bound by an expert's opinion and\n   that they were to weigh the testimony of an expert in the same manner as they would the testimony of any other witness. The jury was also instructed that they could disregard an expert's opinion should they decide that it was not based on sufficient education, experience, or fact, and that they may disregard an expert's opinion entirely should they conclude that the reasons given in support of the opinion were not sound, or if they felt that it was outweighed by other evidence. These are all proper jury instructions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   However, after a thorough review of the record, we find that the jury was properly instructed, the record supports a finding that the partial taking completely eliminated the intended use of the property, and the trial court properly denied DOTD's JNOV and motion for new trial. The jury was presented with sufficient evidence to support a verdict in favor of Moreau for $972,268.00. Accordingly, we find no merit to this issue presented for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ISSUE PRESENTED FOR REVIEW NUMBER FOUR\n    </em>\n    :\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   In its fourth issue presented for review, DOTD contends that the signed jury verdict and/or judgment are invalid when alternative damages are awarded with no clarity as to which remedy prevails or which is ordered to be paid. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \"The appellate court shall render any judgment which is just, legal, and proper upon the record on appeal.\" La.Code Civ.P.art. 2164. The judgment rendered clearly indicates that the jury found $672,628.00 insufficient to justly compensate Moreau. We reversed the alternative award rendered by the jury after improperly being presented a relocation claim. Thus, after this opinion is rendered, DOTD is left with no possibility of confusion as to the result of this case. The proper judgment rendered by the jury found that Moreau proved entitlement to just compensation in the amount of $972,628.00. Further, the jury verdict form issue was rendered moot by our previous determinations that the claim for relocation damages was not properly before the jury, and the just compensation issue was rendered moot by our prior discussion thereon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n    :\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The State through the Department of Transportation and Development presents four issues for review. We find merit to one of the issues raised and reverse the jury's award of relocation damages in the amount of $1,197,090.00 to Kerry Lane Moreau. We assess all costs of these proceedings to the Department of Transportation and Development in the amount of $34,217.63.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <strong>\n    REVERSED, IN PART; AFFIRMED, IN PART.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
