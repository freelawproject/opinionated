R.S. 15:1171\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   Mr. Wallace was arrested on October 21, 1986, the same date he committed the offenses of armed robbery and attempted second-degree murder. He was initially sentenced on February 20, 1987, to hard labor for forty years for armed robbery and thirty years for attempted second-degree murder, to run concurrently. He was released from prison on January 17, 2009, after receiving a dimunition of sentence, commonly known as good time.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Wallace was rearrested on April 25, 2012, for aggravated battery, pled\n   guilty, and was sentenced to seven years. That sentence was to run concurrently with the remaining fourteen years of his previous sentence. Mr. Wallace claims that when he originally was released from prison in 2009, he should not have been required to be under parole supervision. He also claims that he was entitled to earn good time at a rate of sixty days for every thirty days, and therefore, he should have originally been released from custody a decade before he was released on January 17, 2009. Mr. Wallace asserts that his good time was miscalculated and that he is entitled to immediate release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Mr. Wallace filed his request for administrative relief pursuant to CARP.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The request was denied on November 25, 2013. At the first step of the CARP process, Mr. Wallace was told that on January 17, 2009, he was properly released under good time parole supervision in accordance with 1981 La. Acts, No. 762, \u00a7 1, effective July 1, 1982, enacting La. R.S. 15:571.5. He was further told that he was not entitled to sixty days of good time for every thirty days just because he had concurrent sentences. Therefore, DPSC determined that Mr. Wallace was correctly placed on good time parole supervision and his good time computation were correctly calculated. At the second step, his request was again denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Mr. Wallace filed a petition for judicial review in the district court. The 19th JDC Commissioner\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Commissioner) issued a recommendation that the final administrative decision be affirmed to deny relief and that the suit be dismissed with prejudice. In a judgment signed on July 18, 2017, the district court adopted the recommendation of the Commissioner after considering the administrative record, the Commissioner's Report, and the traversal filed by Mr. Wallace. It is from this judgment that Mr. Wallace appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     LAW AND DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Louisiana Revised Statute 15:1177(A)(9) sets forth the appropriate standard of review by the district court, which functions as an appellate court when reviewing DPSC's administrative decisions. Judicial review is mandated to be conducted by the trial court without a jury and must be confined to the record. La. R.S. 15:1177(A)(5). Specifically, the court may reverse or modify the administrative decision only if substantial rights of the appellant have been prejudiced because the administrative findings are: (1) in violation of constitutional or statutory provisions, (2) in excess of the statutory authority of the agency, (3) made upon unlawful procedure, (4) affected by other error of law, (5) arbitrary or capricious or characterized by abuse of discretion, or (6) manifestly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative and substantial evidence on the whole record.

As noted by the Commissioner, Mr. Wallace is questioning DPSC's authority to require parole supervision pursuant to La. R.S. 15:571.5. Mr. Wallace asserts that the good time statute applicable to his sentence is 1987 La. Acts, No. 848, \u00a7 1, effective January 1, 1988, which added La. R.S. 15:571.14(8) (currently incorporated into La. R.S. 15:571.3 ),\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and that because it said nothing about release on parole supervision, DPSC was required to release him without supervision in 2009, his good time release date. Act 848 added paragraph (8),\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   which stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Only inmates sentenced to the custody of the [DPSC] on or after July 1, 1982, and otherwise eligible for dimunition of sentence, shall be eligible to receive increased dimunition of sentence as provided for herein.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In this matter, the Commissioner noted that Louisiana has been statutorily authorizing good time for decades.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   La. R.S. 15:571.3. Prior to 1977, La. R.S. 15:571.4 authorized the DPSC to award up to twenty-five days per month to qualified inmates. Louisiana Revised Statute 15:571.4 was amended by 1977 La. Acts, No. 665, \u00a7 1, allowing inmates whose crimes were committed after September 9, 1977, to earn twenty-five days per month, while allowing inmates whose crimes were committed after that date to earn only fifteen days per month. Because there is no constitutional right to earn good time, the legislative changes are presumed valid unless there was no conceivable reasonable basis for the disparity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Greenholtz v.

Acts, No. 762, \u00a7 1, effective July 1, 1982. From its inception, La. R.S. 15:571.5 required that any inmate that was released early because of good time was to be released under supervision, in the \"same manner and to the same extent\n   <strong>\n    as if released on parole\"\n   </strong>\n   for the remainder of the full term of his original sentence. (Emphasis added). This form of parole is commonly referred to as \"good time parole supervision.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Louisiana Revised Statute 15:571.5, as it read in 1986, stated, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   A. When a prisoner committed to the Department of Public Safety and Corrections is released because of dimunition of sentence pursuant to this Part,\n   <strong>\n    he shall be released as if released on parole.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

The supervision shall be for the remainder of the original full term of sentence\n   </strong>\n   .... (Emphasis added).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Although the above statute has been amended since 1986, neither the language quoted nor the requirement for parole supervision has been altered. Mr. Wallace committed the armed robbery and attempted second degree murder on October 21, 1986. Good time credits are to be determined by the law in effect at the time of the commission of the offense.\n   <em>\n    Massey v. Louisiana Dep't of Pub. Safety &amp; Corr.,\n   </em>\n   2013-2789 (La. 10/15/14),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6913967\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/149/780/#p783\">\n    149 So.3d 780\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 783-86. In 1986, when Mr. Wallace committed the crimes (and currently), La. R.S. 15:571.5 required inmates released on good time credits to be supervised, and if parole was revoked, the inmate was required to serve the balance of his term.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The statute relied upon by Mr. Wallace, La. R.S. 15:571.14 was originally enacted by 1986 La. Acts, No. 299, \u00a7 1, effective August 30, 1986, which authorized what is commonly referred to as \"double good time.\" It allowed DPSC to award good time credit for most inmates of thirty days credit for every thirty days served, while other inmates earned fifty days for every thirty days served.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   This disparate treatment of inmates was the result of different good time laws applicable to different inmates, based on sentencing dates. When Act 848 added subsection (8) to La. R.S. 15:571.14, it applied the double good time law retroactively to all inmates sentenced after July 1, 1982, which included Mr. Wallace.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cox v.
