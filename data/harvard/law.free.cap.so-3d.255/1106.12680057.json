Based on our review of the record and in light of the factors set forth in\n   <em>\n    Barker v. Wingo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9139028\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/407/514/\">\n    407 U.S. 514\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9139028\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/407/514/\">\n    92 S.Ct. 2182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9139028\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/407/514/\">\n    33 L.Ed.2d 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1972), we find no abuse of discretion in the trial court's ruling, and we affirm. In addition, we deny relief sought by defendant in the consolidated writ application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On October 15, 2013, defendant, Timrek Andrews, was arrested following a traffic stop by two New Orleans Police Department (\"NOPD\") officers for a damaged driver-side mirror on defendant's vehicle. During the traffic stop, the officers requested defendant exit and step to the rear of the vehicle for officer safety. After defendant exited the vehicle, the officers observed defendant reach into his front left pocket, remove a clear plastic baggie containing an off-white powder substance, and place the baggie in his mouth. In an attempt to restrain defendant, a struggle ensued between the officers and defendant. Once the officers gained control of defendant, they placed him under arrest. Observing that defendant had suffered injuries during the scuffle and believing that he had ingested the plastic baggie containing the off-white powder substance, the officers contacted Emergency Medical Services to transport defendant to University Hospital for evaluation. Defendant was subsequently arrested and booked on a felony charge of obstruction of justice, a violation of La. R.S. 14:130.1, and misdemeanor charges of resisting an officer, a violation of s La. R.S. 14:108, and battery of a police officer (2 counts), a violation of La. R.S. 14:34.2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On December 5, 2013, the State filed a bill of information in Orleans Parish Municipal Court charging defendant with the three misdemeanor offenses. Defendant was arraigned that same date and pled not guilty. The felony charge of obstruction of justice was refused by the Orleans Parish District Attorney's Office.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On May 20, 2014, the first trial setting in Municipal Court, a motion to continue the trial was filed, and trial was rescheduled for August 14, 2014. The record does not reflect which party requested the continuance. On August 14, 2014, the State was granted a continuance due to the failure of the victim to appear. On November 13, 2014, the Orleans Parish Public Defender was appointed to represent defendant; trial was rescheduled for February 10, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On February 10, 2015, defendant failed to appear for trial, an attachment was issued, and defendant's bond was forfeited. On March 4, 2015, the attachment was recalled; defendant was found in contempt of court, assessed a fine of one-hundred dollars, and ordered to spend five nights in jail. On May 14, 2015, the defense was granted a continuance of trial due to NOPD officers' failure to appear. On July 31, 2015, the defense sought another continuance, and trial was rescheduled for August 25, 2015. On that date, the State sought a continuance, and trial was rescheduled for September 29, 2015. After a subsequent status hearing, trial was scheduled for December 10, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On October 30, 2015, the State filed a second bill of information charging defendant in Orleans Parish Criminal District Court with one felony count of obstruction of justice and the three misdemeanor charges pending against defendant in Municipal\n   Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On November 13, 2015, defendant appeared for arraignment in Criminal District Court and entered a plea of not guilty. On December 10, 2015, the State\n   <em>\n    nolle prosequied\n   </em>\n   the charges pending against defendant in Municipal Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On September 28, 2016, the first trial setting in Criminal District Court, defendant failed to appear for trial; the trial court issued an alias capias. The following day, defendant appeared before the trial court; the court found him in contempt and imposed a fine; and the alias capias was recalled. Trial was scheduled for November 29, 2016. On that date, the trial court granted the State a continuance, over the defense's objection. On January 17, 2017, the trial court granted the defense a continuance, over the State's objection. Three more trial settings followed: March 21, 2017; May 22, 2017; and July 17, 2017. On each date, the trial court granted the State a continuance, over the defense's objection. Trial was then set for October 2, 2017. Prior to that trial setting, defense counsel appeared without defendant for unscheduled activity on July 21, 2017. On that date, the October 2, 2017 trial date was vacated, and trial was re-set for September 25, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On September 25, 2017, defendant filed a motion to quash for denial of defendant's constitutional right to a speedy trial. Defendant appeared in court that day ready for trial, but the State moved for another continuance of the trial. The trial court denied the State's motion for a continuance and granted defendant's motion to quash. In granting the motion to quash, the trial court reasoned that the four year delay since defendant was initially charged constituted a violation of his right to a speedy trial. The State objected to the trial court's ruling and noticed its intent to appeal. On that same date, the State filed its motion for appeal and designation of the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    Motion to Dismiss the Appeal\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Before considering the merits of the State's appeal, we address the defendant's motion to dismiss the appeal as untimely. Defendant argues that the State abandoned this appeal when the State failed to comply with its obligations as the party moving for the appeal pursuant to La. C.Cr.P. arts. 915 and 915.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   A motion for an appeal must be made no later than thirty days after the rendition of the judgment or ruling from which the appeal is taken. La. C.Cr.P. art. 914.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Once the motion for appeal is made, the trial court \"shall\" set the return date seventy-five days from the date the motion for appeal is granted, unless the trial court fixes a lesser period. La. C.Cr.P. art. 915(A). In addition, \"[t]he party moving for the appeal must forward notice that a motion for appeal has been made to the appropriate appellate court within seven days of the date the motion is made.\" La. C.Cr.P. art. 915(B). Once the trial court signs an order of appeal setting a return date, \"[t]he trial court may grant one extension of the return date of not more than thirty days,\" but \"[a]n extension may not be granted after the return date has passed.\" La. C.Cr.P. art. 915.1. Further, \"[t]he extension may be granted only upon\n   proof presented by the moving party that additional time is necessary due to extenuating circumstances beyond the control of the moving party and that, without the extension, an unusual and undue hardship would be created.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9139028\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/407/514/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The record of this case reflects that the State timely filed its motion for appeal and designation of the record on the day of the trial court's ruling granting defendant's motion to quash, September 25, 2017. That same date, the trial court signed the order of appeal and set the return date for November 27, 2017. The record does not reflect that the trial court or this Court granted any extension of the return date. However, the appeal record was not lodged in this Court until February 23, 2018, 151 days from the date the motion for appeal was granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Defendant argues that the State's failure to request an extension of the return date and its failure to provide notice of the motion for appeal to this Court are grounds for dismissal of the appeal, because the State had a mandatory obligation as the party moving for the appeal to take affirmative steps to ensure that the record of the appeal was timely lodged in this Court, pursuant to La. C.Cr.P. arts. 915 and 915.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   This Court has previously addressed and rejected the same argument raised by defendants moving to dismiss the State's appeal as untimely and abandoned.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

In each of those cases, the State timely moved for an appeal, and the trial court timely granted the motion and set a return date; however, years passed before the record of each case was lodged in this Court. In each case, this Court found that once the State timely moved for an appeal and the trial court granted the motion, the burden then fell upon the district court personnel, not the State, to prepare and lodge the record for appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Noel\n   </em>\n   , 13-1218, pp. 2-4,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6904710\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/151/706/\">\n    151 So.3d at 709-710\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"[T]here is no further action that must be taken by the State until the record is lodged with the court of appeal.\"\n   <em>\n    Hall\n   </em>\n   , 13-0453, p. 7,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6996474\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/127/30/\">\n    127 So.3d at 36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    State v.

Moreover, \"the failure of the trial court,\" or court personnel \"to perform their functions in connection with the filing of a criminal appeal does not affect the validity of the appeal.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8307924\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/955/167/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   , La. C.Cr.P. arts. 915(A) and (B), 915.1(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Applying the aforementioned principles and jurisprudence, we find no merit to defendant's argument that the State abandoned its appeal. The State timely moved for this appeal and the trial court timely granted it. Thereafter, the district court personnel bore responsibility to prepare and lodge the record for appeal; and the State did not need to take further action until the record was lodged. Accordingly, defendant's motion to dismiss the State's appeal is denied.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    Motion to Quash\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In the first assignment of error, the State argues that the trial court abused its discretion in granting the defendant's motion to quash on constitutional grounds. The State contends defendant's constitutional right to a speedy trial was not violated and his motion to quash was improperly granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \"The granting of a defendant's motion to quash the bill of information is a discretionary ruling by the trial court which should not be disturbed by the appellate court, absent an abuse of its discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    Noel\n   </em>\n   , 13-1218, p. 4,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6904710\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/151/706/\">\n    151 So.3d at 710\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The complementary role of trial courts and appellate courts demands that deference be given to a trial court's discretionary decision; thus, an appellate court is allowed to reverse a trial court judgment on a motion to quash only if that finding represents a clear abuse of the trial court's discretion.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Subsequent to filing the second bill of information, the State\n   <em>\n    nolle prosequied\n   </em>\n   the original bill of information filed in Municipal Court. Twenty-three months later, on September 25, 2017, the trial court granted defendant's motion to quash the second bill of information.

Moreover, the State argues since it initially declined or dismissed the felony obstruction of justice charge in the initial bill of information, the twenty-three month time differential between the filing of the initial bill of information and the institution of that charge by the second bill of information does not weigh upon defendant's right to a speedy trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   It is undisputed that there was no violation of the statutory time limitation for instituting prosecution and commencing trial for the felony charge, pursuant to La.

In addition, although defendant was not charged with the felony offense until approximately twenty-three months prior to the granting of the motion to quash, defendant was held to answer the three misdemeanors, charged in both bills of information, for nearly four years. Even excluding the time period between the filing of the initial and second bill of information, we find the twenty-three month time delay to be presumptively prejudicial, thereby triggering consideration of the three remaining\n   <em>\n    Barker\n   </em>\n   factors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Turning to the second factor, the reason for the delay, we review the record to determine which party is primarily responsible for the delay in commencing trial. Upon review of the entire length of delay since the filing of the initial bill of information,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   the record reflects five continuances of trial in Municipal Court and five continuances of trial in Criminal District Court. While in Criminal District Court, the State sought and was granted continuances on November 29, 2016; March 21, 2017; May 22, 2017; and July 17, 2017. The reasons for these continuances are not noted in the record. But, on each of those dates, defendant appeared ready for trial and objected to the continuance. Finally, on September 25, 2017, the State sought a fifth continuance of trial, stating that it was ready for trial in another matter, \"an older case\", and \"we have a new ADA on [this] case.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The State argues that defendant is \"equally culpable\" for the delays in commencing trial. In support, the State points to defendant's failure to appear for the first trial setting on September 28, 2016, to a continuance sought and granted to defense on January 17, 2017, and to a discovery motion filed by defense on July 11, 2017. In response, defendant acknowledges responsibility for his failure to appear on September 28, 2016, for which he was found in contempt and fined the following day when he appeared in court. Defendant also acknowledges brief delays for motion hearings. Defendant argues, however, that the State was primarily responsible for the four year delay in this case. Moreover, defendant contends that the State used the continuances as a dilatory tactic to prompt defendant to accept a plea, which the State offered on three occasions;\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   defendant, however, insisted on his right to a speedy trial rather than accept a plea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   From our review of the record, we find the majority of the multiple delays in commencing trial are attributable to the State. After two years of delays in Municipal Court, the State filed the second bill of information on October 30, 2015, and did not seek to commence trial until nearly one year later. Although defendant did not appear on the first trial date in September 2016, defendant appeared ready for trial on each of the five subsequent trial dates when the State sought continuances. Additionally, the record reflects two times when the State offered to dismiss the felony charge in exchange for defendant entering a guilty plea to misdemeanor charges, for which the time limitation to prosecute had long expired.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, upon review of the consolidated writ application in this case, we note the State only obtained a search warrant for evidence in support of the felony charge of obstruction of justice after the trial court granted the motion to quash.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, it appears from the record that the State's interest in securing a guilty plea surpassed its interest in preparing this case for trial or providing defendant with a speedy trial. Given the lack of reasonably diligent efforts to bring defendant to trial, we find the State fails to establish a justifiable reason for a\n   twenty-four month delay, much less a four year delay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The third\n   <em>\n    Barker\n   </em>\n   factor concerns defendant's assertion of his right to a speedy trial. The record reflects that defendant did not file a motion for a speedy trial at any time prior to filing the motion to quash. However, defendant objected to each of the four trial continuances sought and granted to the State prior to filing the motion to quash. In\n   <em>\n    Barker\n   </em>\n   , the Court rejected a bright line rule that defendant must assert his right to speedy trial lest it be waived; instead, the Court implemented a balancing test, \"in which the conduct of both the prosecution and the defendant are weighed.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9139028\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/407/514/\">\n    407 U.S. at 529-30\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9139028\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/407/514/\">\n    92 S.Ct. at 2191-92\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"While the 'failure to assert the right will make it difficult for a defendant to prove that he was denied a speedy trial', it is not dispositive as 'defendant's assertion of or failure to assert his right is\n   <em>\n    one\n   </em>\n   of the factors to be considered.' \"\n   <em>\n    Noel\n   </em>\n   , 13-1218, pp. 7-8,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6904710\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/151/706/\">\n    151 So.3d at 712\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Barker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9139028\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/407/514/\">\n    407 U.S. at 528, 531-32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9139028\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/407/514/\">\n    92 S.Ct. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   2192 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Reaves\n   </em>\n   , the Louisiana Supreme Court found the failure of defendant to move for a speedy trial prior to his motion to quash did not weigh heavily under the facts of the case.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9579510\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/376/136/\">\n    376 So.2d at 139\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Defendant was charged with a simple misdemeanor possession of marijuana charge and he filed his motion to quash after only three and one-half months of delay. But, the Court found that after four continuances of the trial date, \"defendant finally realized that the new trial setting was probably illusory in light of the prior course of the proceedings\"; thus, \"[h]is only avenue at that point, and the trial judge agreed, was to file a motion to quash.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9579510\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/376/136/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Similarly, in this case, there is a pattern of delay and continuances by the State. Although the State argued for a short continuance to October 2, 2017, the State had two-months notice of the September 25, 2017 trial date. We also note the State does not refute defense counsel's argument that he was informed five days prior to the September 25 trial date that the State was ready to proceed. But, anticipating that the State may seek another continuance, defense counsel also prepared a motion to quash to be filed in the event that the State sought to delay trial again. In consideration of the history of this case and defendant's numerous objections to continuing the trial date, we do not weigh heavily the defendant's failure to file a motion for speedy trial prior to filing the motion to quash.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Turning to the fourth and final\n   <em>\n    Barker\n   </em>\n   factor, we must assess the prejudice to defendant caused by the delay. Prejudice should be assessed particularly in light of three interests that the right to speedy trial was designed to protect: to prevent oppressive pretrial incarceration; to minimize anxiety and concern of the accused; and to limit the possibility that the defense will be impaired.\n   <em>\n    Barker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9139028\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/407/514/\">\n    407 U.S. at 532-33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9139028\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/407/514/\">\n    92 S.Ct. at 2193\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In addition to the delays, we note the State's official negligence in filing the second bill of information charging defendant with three misdemeanor offenses for which the time limitation to prosecute had expired. While there is no basis to find that the State acted in bad faith by failing to dismiss those expired charges, such official negligence does present a \"threat to the fairness of the accused's trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Doggett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1480837\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/647/#p652\">\n    505 U.S. at 657\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1480837\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/647/#p652\">\n    112 S.Ct. at 2693\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Further, defendant asserts that in addition to the cloud of anxiety and suspicion related to the four years of criminal charges pending against him, he has suffered actual prejudice in the impairment of his defense. Specifically, defendant asserts that the State disclosed at an earlier trial setting that all NOPD audio recordings from eyewitnesses taken contemporaneous to defendant's arrest had been lost. In addition, defense counsel spoke with two defense eyewitnesses whose recollections of the events surrounding defendant's arrest in 2013 had faded to a point that they may not be reliable. Finally, defense investigators have been unable to locate a third potential witness who had left Orleans Parish.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   As to the fourth factor, the State argues that defense counsel raised the constitutional speedy trial violation by a motion to quash as a \"deliberate tactic\" that would \"actually cause Defendant more prejudice to his legal rights.\" The State does not address the defendant's assertions of actual prejudice from the loss of evidence and potential loss of eyewitness testimony. The State's failure to address defendant's assertion of actual prejudice does not weigh in its favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Upon a careful consideration of the\n   <em>\n    Barker\n   </em>\n   factors as they apply to the particular circumstances of this case, we find no abuse of discretion in the trial court's decision to grant defendant's motion to quash based on a violation of his constitutional right to a speedy trial. The State's persistent neglect in concluding this criminal prosecution indicates a feeble interest in bringing defendant to justice. To condone prolonged and unjustifiable delays in this case would both penalize defendant for the State's fault and \"simply encourage the government to gamble with the interests of criminal suspects assigned a low prosecutorial priority.\"\n   <em>\n    Doggett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1480837\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/647/#p652\">\n    505 U.S. at 657\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1480837\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/647/#p652\">\n    112 S.Ct. at 2693\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    Motion to Continue\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In the second assignment of error, the State argues that the trial court abused its discretion in denying the State's oral motion to continue the motion to quash to allow for a response and a contradictory hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \"The trial court is vested with considerable discretion in ruling on a motion for continuance, and the reviewing court will not disturb the trial court's ruling absent a clear abuse of discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

C.Cr.P. art. 535 ; rather, defendant filed this motion to quash to assert his fundamental, constitutional right to a speedy trial. While Louisiana jurisprudence recognizes a motion to quash as \"an all embracive plea\" by which a defendant may assert a constitutional speedy trial claim, our jurisprudence does not hold that the same statutory procedures must be followed for filing a motion to quash based on constitutional grounds.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reaves\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9579510\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/376/136/\">\n    376 So.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   137-38 ;\n   <em>\n    State v.

Here again, however, the motion to quash at issue in\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   , and each of the cases cited therein, was based on the grounds that the statutory prescriptive period for prosecution or commencement of trial had expired. When a defendant files an apparently meritorious motion to quash based on prescription, the State bears a heavy burden of proving facts necessary to show that prescription was interrupted or suspended.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Consequently, in consideration that a motion to quash based on statutory grounds of prescription places the burden on the State to prove facts necessary to show that the prosecution was instituted timely, this Court has found it to be an abuse of discretion for a trial court to deny the State time to respond and prepare to meet its high burden of proof.\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    State v.

Thus, the State posits that it is guaranteed the same constitutional right of due process as guaranteed to the criminal defendant by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article 1, \u00a7 2 of the Louisiana Constitution. This argument has no merit. Procedural due process as guaranteed by the United States Constitution and Louisiana Constitution protects a\n   <em>\n    person\n   </em>\n   from the deprivation of life, liberty, or property [through state action] without due process of law, notice, and opportunity to be heard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   We find no merit to any of the State's arguments. Further, we note that the State has failed to argue that it suffered any specific prejudice from the trial court's denial of a continuance. Thus, we find no abuse of discretion in the trial court's denial of the State's oral motion to continue the motion to quash.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    Defendant's Writ Application\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   In the consolidated writ application, defendant seeks review of the Magistrate Commissioner's denial of defendant's petition to quash a search warrant and for sanctions against the State. For the following reasons, we deny the writ.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   On March 16, 2018, while the State's appeal of the trial court's ruling granting defendant's motion to quash was pending in this Court, the State submitted to the Magistrate Commissioner an application for a search warrant to obtain defendant's medical records from Interim LSU Public Hospital for the date of his arrest in October 2013. The Magistrate Commissioner signed the search warrant authorizing the State to search for and obtain defendant's medical records. After learning that the State had obtained and executed the search warrant, defense counsel filed a \"Petition\" in Magistrate Court seeking sanctions against the State and the quashal of the search warrant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   At a hearing before the Magistrate Commissioner on April 3, 2018, defense counsel argued that the search warrant for defendant's medical records was improperly obtained pursuant to La. R.S. 13:3715.1. In its consideration of defendant's petition, the Commissioner noted that the State has the power to continue a criminal investigation while the motion to quash is on appeal and the Commissioner is authorized to sign a search warrant in an open criminal investigation. Ultimately, however, the Commissioner denied defendant's petition based on a lack of jurisdiction to grant the relief sought by defendant in a criminal case currently on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Defendant timely filed the instant writ of the Commissioner's ruling. On this Court's own motion, defendant's writ was consolidated with the State's pending appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   First, we agree that the Commissioner was without jurisdiction to rule on a pleading in a criminal case on appeal. Upon the entering of the order of appeal in the criminal case, the Criminal District Court and its ancillary Magistrate Court were divested of jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   La. C.Cr.P. art. 916 ; La. R.S. 13:1336 ; 13:1347;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   , La. C.Cr.P. art. 913.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   In addition, we find no merit in defendant's substantive argument. Defendant contends that the State was required to obtain defendant's medical records in accordance with La. R.S. 13:3715.1. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    State v.

The Louisiana Supreme Court found as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   Considering the federal jurisprudence and Louisiana's constitutional requirement of a heightened privacy interest for its citizens, we find that the right to privacy in one's medical and prescription records is an expectation of privacy that society is prepared to recognize as reasonable.

We are not prepared to extend\n   <em>\n    Whalen [v.

Proc. art. 66 and La. Rev. Stat. 13:3715.1\n   </strong>\n   , which the State had admittedly failed to comply with in obtaining the defendant's prescription and medical records, in order for these records to be admissible at trial. The trial court's ruling essentially permits the State to re-subpoena the prescription and medical records, allowing the State to introduce them at trial if the State has followed all the procedural requirements of La.Rev.Stat. 13:3715.1 and/or La.Code Crim. Proc. art. 66 in procuring these records a second time. However, because we find the Fourth Amendment and La. Const. art. I, \u00a7 5 require a search warrant before a search of prescription and medical records for criminal investigative purposes is permitted, the State cannot cure its warrantless search and seizure of the records by a second subpoena of these records.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   A search warrant for property where one has a reasonable expectation of privacy may issue only upon probable cause established to the satisfaction of a magistrate, by the affidavit of a credible person, particularly describing the person or place to be searched and the things to be seized. La. Const. art. I, \u00a7 5 ; La. Code Crim. Proc. art. 162. The procedural requirements of La.Rev.Stat. 13:3715.1 simply and clearly do not suffice to comply with the constitutional requirements of probable cause supported by a sworn affidavit for the issuance of a search warrant. Thus, it is irrelevant whether or not the State complied with the requirements of La.Rev.Stat. 13:3715.1, and any subsequent compliance with its procedural requirements is insufficient to permit the introduction of evidence that was illegally searched and seized. This evidence must be suppressed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <em>\n    Skinner\n   </em>\n   , 2008-2522, pp. 10-11,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7065244\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/10/1212/\">\n    10 So.3d at 1218\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Based on the foregoing, we find no error in the Commissioner's ruling denying defendant's petition to quash the search warrant and for sanctions.

The State requested it be given an opportunity to prepare a response to the motion to quash.
