In March 2016, the children were found to be dependent by the juvenile court and were placed in the custody of DHR.

Pursuant to \u00a7 12-15-320(b)(1), \"[a]n order of the juvenile court which terminates parental rights and awards permanent legal custody to the Department of Human Resources ... shall mean that the Department of Human Resources ... shall have authority to make permanent plans for the child, including the authority to place for adoption and consent to adoption.\" DHR argues that, pursuant to \u00a7 12-15-321, the juvenile court had the authority to review the children's circumstances to determine what efforts had been made to achieve permanency for the children, but not the authority to compel DHR to take specific action. DHR further argues that the juvenile court's permanency review orders usurp its authority by making \"findings about the children which contravene the case plan set out in the [Individualized Service Plans] for the children to be adopted by their current foster parents.\" DHR also argues that the separation of powers doctrine set out in Article III, \u00a7 42, of the Alabama Constitution of 1901, prohibits the juvenile court from directing the placement of the children because to do so usurps the function of DHR.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In his answer, the guardian ad litem asserts that \u00a7 12-15-321\"provides a check on the executive power of [DHR] in order to monitor children where their parent's parental rights have been terminated.\" The guardian ad litem further asserts that, pursuant to \u00a7 12-15-101(a), Ala. Code 1975, the juvenile court has a duty to facilitate the care and protection of children and that, pursuant to \u00a7 12-15-321, the juvenile court exercised its authority to ensure that DHR follows its own policies.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Alabama Department of Human Resources\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6899840\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/154/1060/\">\n    154 So.3d 1060\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Ala.

R. Evid., the juvenile court is permitted to compel a witness to appear and give testimony. Although we agree that Rule 614(a) authorizes a court to call witnesses on its own motion, it does not appear that the juvenile court has ordered the Commissioner's appearance for the purpose of taking testimony on a relevant pending issue. In its permanency review orders, the juvenile court stated: \"It is FURTHER ORDERED that Nancy Buckner shall personally appear at the next permanency hearing to fully explain to the Court her special interest in this case. It is time for the wizard to come out from behind the curtain.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The materials before us show that the juvenile court's ordering the Commissioner's appearance is not for the purpose of\n   eliciting her testimony. Therefore, compelling the Commissioner to personally attend the hearing appears to be beyond the authority of the juvenile court in conducting the review under \u00a7 12-15-321. Our holding is not to be construed as foreclosing a court from compelling the attendance of any witness regardless of job title pursuant to Rule 614(a) for the purpose of testifying to his or her personal knowledge on a relevant pending matter before the court. The materials before us, however, do not show that the orders compelling the Commissioner to attend a hearing was for that purpose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   With regard to the portion of the permanency review orders directing the Commissioner to interview the children, we note that the Commissioner's statutory duties do not encompass such a duty, and we can find no statutory authority permitting the juvenile court to enlarge the Commissioner's duties or to dictate the manner in which the Commissioner performs her statutory duties. The separation-of-powers doctrine \"prohibits the judicial branch, through adjudications, from usurping functions dedicated to the executive and legislative branches.\"\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Bronner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6860799\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/171/614/#p621\">\n    171 So.3d 614\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 621 (Ala. 2014). Accordingly, DHR's petition is due to be granted insofar as it relates to the juvenile court's orders directing the Commissioner to conduct interviews of the children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   DHR also challenges the juvenile court's September 5, 2017, orders denying its motions for transcription of the proceedings.

Likewise, Rule 29(B), Ala. R. Jud. Admin., has been completely modified to govern the fees and procedures for court reporters; it does not provide a party with a right to a transcript of proceedings.

Civ. App. 2017). DHR has not demonstrated a clear legal right to have the September 5, 2017, orders denying its motions for transcription vacated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the juvenile court is directed to vacate the portions of the August 25, 2017, permanency review orders directing placement of the children, ordering the Commissioner to conduct interviews of the children, and ordering the Commissioner to appear at the next permanency review hearing. DHR's petition is denied insofar as it seeks to have this court direct the juvenile court to vacate its orders denying DHR's requests for transcription of proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   2160995-PETITION GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART; WRIT ISSUED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   2160996-PETITION GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART; WRIT ISSUED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Thompson, P.J., and Pittman, J., concur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Moore, J., concurs in part and dissents in part, with writing, which Thomas, J., joins.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   I concur in that part of the main opinion concluding that the Limestone County Department of Human Resources (\"the Limestone County DHR\") cannot raise any issues regarding an alleged violation of the Foster Parents' Bill of Rights and that the Limestone Juvenile Court (\"the juvenile court\") exceeded its authority in ordering Nancy Buckner, the commissioner of the Alabama Department of Human Resources (\"the State DHR\"), to interview A.S.H. and T.K.H. (\"the children\"). I respectfully dissent as to the remaining parts of the main opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   I do not view this case as involving any usurpation of power by the juvenile court. In my opinion, the juvenile court did not assume the authority to alter the permanency plan for the children established by the Limestone County DHR in conjunction with the State DHR, which remains to this day adoption by their respective foster parents. The juvenile court ordered that the current living arrangements of the children be modified so that A.S.H. could reside in a therapeutic foster home and T.K.H. could maintain a meaningful relationship with her sister until they are adopted. Notably, the juvenile court found that, at least at one point, the Limestone County DHR had established a plan for such arrangements. Nothing in the petition filed by the Limestone County DHR directly attacks the authority of the juvenile court to make such interim placement orders; instead, its arguments are limited solely to the proposition that the juvenile court lacks the statutory authority and the constitutional power to change the permanency plan for the children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   In my opinion, the juvenile court also has the authority, pursuant to Rule 614(a), Ala. R. Evid., to order Nancy Buckner, the commissioner of the State DHR, to appear for a hearing. In its orders, the juvenile court finds that Buckner has personally intervened in the cases to prevent the placement of A.S.H. in a therapeutic foster home and to prevent contact between the children. The juvenile court further finds that Buckner has taken such actions in violation of the policies of the State DHR that, as the commissioner of the State DHR, she is required to enforce. The orders indicate that the juvenile court intends to question Buckner to have her explain her and the State DHR's actions as part of the juvenile court's authority and duty under Ala. Code 1975, \u00a7 12-15-321, to review the efforts taken by the State DHR to achieve the permanency plan established for the children. The Limestone County DHR has not presented in its mandamus petition any clear legal authority that exempts the commissioner from testifying under these circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Finally, I believe that the Limestone County DHR presented good cause for its request for the transcripts of the termination-of-parental-rights trial and the permanency review hearing. The Limestone County DHR informed the juvenile court that it planned to appeal or to file a petition for a writ of mandamus and that it needed the transcripts to support its positions. The Limestone County DHR needed the transcripts in order to more fully inform this court of the underlying facts giving rise to the juvenile court's August 25, 2017, orders. Perhaps if this court were privy to all the evidence, my opinion would be different. Therefore, I believe that the juvenile court exceeded its discretion in refusing to order the transcripts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Thomas, J., concurs.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    With minor alterations, we have quoted the order entered in A.S.H.'s case. The orders are distinguishable only insofar as the order entered in A.S.H.'s case contains additional language to refer to A.S.H.'s foster family and circumstances; that information was not contained in the order in T.K.H.'s case.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    We note that DHR's motions were directed to nonfinal orders, and, thus, were not filed pursuant to Rule 59, Ala.
