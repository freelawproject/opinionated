The parties divorced in February 2013. The divorce judgment incorporated an agreement entered into by the parties in January 2013 while the father was incarcerated. The divorce judgment awarded the mother sole physical and legal custody of the parties' four children and provided that the father would have no visitation or any contact whatsoever with the children during their minority. The agreement incorporated into the judgment further provided, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   \"5. [The father] is self-employed and his income is variable. However, because of [the father's] actions, [he] presently has no income and has no anticipation of earning any income in the immediate future. Therefore, both parties agree that in lieu of current child support, [the mother] will continue to occupy the [parties'] residence located [in Moundville, Alabama], and [the mother] will continue to pay the mortgage on said property. When the younger children reach the age of majority, or if [the mother] remarries, the property will be listed for sale as soon as possible thereafter and the net proceeds of such sale, less one-half (\u00bd) of all payments made by [the mother] for principal, interest, insurance, and ad valorem taxes from October 2012 to the date of such sale, shall be divided between [the mother] and [the father]. [The father] agrees to immediately execute and deliver to [the mother] or her agent any and all documents that may be required to accomplish the intention of this paragraph and shall promptly do all things necessary to that end.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   \"6. When [the father] is gainfully employed, [he] shall pay to [the mother] an amount to be determined by the court based on the parties' incomes at that time as support for the minor children of the parties, said payments to be by income withholding order upon petition by [the mother] or [the father]. Further, when [the father] is gainfully employed, [the father] is to pay for and keep in force all available medical, optical, and dental insurance on the children during their minority. Additionally the parties agree that each party will pay one-half (\u00bd) of all medical, dental, prescription drug, and optical expenses not covered by insurance and one-half (\u00bd) of all insurance co-pays, school, and college expenses.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   \"7. All outstanding indebtedness of both [the mother] and [the father] as of the date of this Agreement will be paid by [the father], and [the father] will hold [the mother] harmless therefrom....\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After being released from jail in May 2013, the father was admitted to an alcohol-abuse-rehabilitation facility and remained there until August 2013. The father then held several jobs in the construction industry. His first job was working for Mike's Framing; that job began on August 30, 2013, and ended in May 2014. He worked full time for Mike's Framing; initially, he was paid $12.50 per hour but that was later increased to $14.25 or $14.50 per hour. After his job with Mike's Framing ended, the father was unemployed for several months while he looked for\n   another job. In late August or early September 2014, the father began working for B &amp; B Construction and was paid approximately $14.75 per hour; however, he lost that job in December 2014 when he was arrested on a charge of domestic violence. He was released from jail in January 2015 and applied to the Social Security Administration for disability benefits in February 2015; however, his application for disability benefits was denied after he accepted a job with Humphrey &amp; Associates, another construction company, in March 2015. He was paid $18 per hour by Humphrey &amp; Associates and worked for that company until he suffered an on-the-job injury in June 2015. The father testified that a load of 14 sheets of drywall had fallen on his leg, breaking his leg and damaging the soft tissue of his leg. He had to have surgery on his leg and received workers' compensation benefits in the amount of approximately $1,000 per month while he recovered from his injury. Since recovering from his injury, the father has successfully bid as a contractor on several construction jobs but has not held a full-time job. He testified that a second application to the Social Security Administration for disability benefits he had submitted a few months before trial had been denied because he was unable to submit all the necessary documents due to his having been incarcerated at the time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After the father became gainfully employed, neither he nor the mother sought an order establishing the amount of his child-support obligation; however, between October 4, 2013, and May 12, 2015, the father made periodic payments to the mother in various amounts and on an irregular basis. The father introduced into evidence documents evidencing payments during that period totaling $10,300. He did not make any payments to the mother after May 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   When the parties' divorced, they owed approximately $4,000 on a Visa credit card and owed their bank approximately $250 for an overdraft on their checking account. The father neither paid the debts the parties owed when they divorced nor provided medical, dental, and optical insurance for the children. The mother paid the $250 debt the parties owed their bank for an overdraft and paid approximately $2,000 of the debt the parties owed on their Visa credit card. In addition, the mother provided the children's medical, dental, and optical insurance. When this action was tried in August 2016, the mother had incurred total costs of $13,381 to provide the children's insurance. In addition, when this action was tried, the mother had paid a total of approximately $750 in medical expenses incurred for treatment of the children that were not covered by insurance, and the father had not reimbursed her for his one-half share of those expenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The mother testified that, shortly after the divorce, she and the father had agreed that she would assume sole liability for the debt secured by a mortgage on the parties' residence in exchange for the father's conveying his interest in the residence to the mother and that the father had executed a quitclaim deed conveying his interest in the residence to her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    Procedural History\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In May 2015, the mother filed a petition alleging that, despite his having had several jobs since the entry of the divorce judgment, the father had willfully refused to pay the mother child support on a regular basis; had willfully failed to pay the debts the parties owed when the divorce judgment was entered; had willfully failed to pay for the children's medical, dental, and optical insurance; and had willfully failed\n   to pay one-half of the children's medical, dental, and optical expenses that were not covered by insurance. As relief, the mother sought a judgment finding the father in contempt and modifying the divorce judgment so as to establish the amount of child support the father was required to pay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Answering the mother's petition, the father admitted that he had had several jobs since the entry of the divorce judgment; however, he denied her allegations that he had willfully failed to pay his obligations under the divorce judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   After several continuances, the action was tried in August 2016. In October 2016, the trial court entered a judgment. In pertinent part, that judgment states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   \"1.

R. Civ. P., postjudgment motion on November 15, 2016. Among other things, the mother asserted that the trial court had erred by failing to calculate the father's\n   child-support obligations in accordance with Rule 32, Ala. R. Jud. Admin.; by awarding the father a setoff against his obligation to provide medical, dental, and optical insurance for the children based on his conveyance of his interest in the marital residence in the absence of any evidence establishing the value of his interest in the marital residence; by failing to award the mother $250 for the checking-account-overdraft debt she had paid the parties' bank; by granting the father the option to pay the mother for the approximately $2,213 still owed on the parties' credit-card debt in installments of $100 per month; by ordering the father to pay prospectively only $200 per month for medical, dental, and optical insurance despite the undisputed evidence establishing that the mother was paying $710 per month for such insurance; and by failing to award the mother an attorney's fee. The trial court held a hearing regarding the mother's postjudgment motion on January 31, 2017. At the end of the hearing, the following colloquy occurred regarding the father's child-support obligations:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   \"THE COURT: Y'all can do the [child-support] calculations based on the [Rule 32, Ala. R. Jud. Admin.,] guidelines and the formulas and submit it to me.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   \"[The father's counsel]: All I can do is impute for him minimum wage.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   \"THE COURT: You can impute your [sic] salary and minimum wage. Just do them both so I can look at them.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   \"[The mother's counsel]: So you want us to use minimum wage imputed full time?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   \"THE COURT: Right. You can do both.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   On February 2, 2017, the mother filed two CS-42 forms, one showing what the father's child-support obligation would be if it were calculated on the basis of imputing the income he would earn if he were working full time for $17 per hour, and the other showing what the father's child-support obligation would be if it were calculated on the basis of imputing the income he would earn if he were working full time for the minimum wage. The father did not file a CS-42 form or any other document showing a proposed calculation of his child-support obligation. The trial court did not enter an amended judgment before 90 days had elapsed since the filing of the mother's postjudgment motion, and, consequently, that motion was denied by operation of law pursuant to Rule 59.1, Ala. R. Civ. P. Thereafter, the mother timely filed a notice of appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <em>\n    Standard of Review\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   \" ' \" '[W]hen a trial court hears ore tenus testimony, its findings on disputed facts are presumed correct and its judgment based on those findings will not be reversed unless the judgment is palpably erroneous or manifestly unjust.' \" '\n   <em>\n    Water Works &amp; Sanitary Sewer Bd. v.

The only child-support forms in the record are the two CS-42 forms filed by the mother after the hearing on her postjudgment motion. Neither of those CS-42 forms conforms to the calculations contained in the trial court's judgment. Thus, the record contains no CS-42 form showing how the trial court calculated the father's child-support obligations as established in its judgment, and we cannot tell from the judgment itself how the trial court calculated those obligations. Paragraph 7 of the judgment states that \"the [father's) child-support obligation began on August 1, 2013 and is due to be reduced from that date forward to the amount of $200.00 per month.\" However, paragraph 8 calculates the father's child-support obligation for the 15-month period between August 1, 2013, and November 1, 2014, based on a child-support obligation of $425 per month, and paragraph 9 calculates his child-support obligation for the 20-month period between December 1, 2014, and August 1, 2016, based on a child-support obligation of $225 per month. In paragraph 6 of the judgment, the trial court found that the father \"has an ability to make at least $12.00 per hour\" but \"that the [father] has not been able to secure a forty (40) hour work week at this rate of pay.\" That finding together with the finding in paragraph 7 that the father's child-support obligation should be reduced to $200 per month indicates that the child-support obligations established by the judgment are downward deviations from the Rule 32 guidelines; however, the judgment does not indicate the amount of the gross monthly income the trial court imputed to the father. Paragraph 6 implies that the trial court imputed income of $12 per hour to the father but does not indicate how many hours of work per month the trial court imputed to the father. Without knowing the amount of gross monthly income the trial court imputed to the father, we have no way of knowing how the trial court calculated the child-support obligations established in its judgment.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   \"This court has held that if the record does not reflect compliance with Rule 32(E), Ala. R. Jud. Admin. (which requires the filing of 'Child Support Obligation Income Statement/Affidavit' forms (Forms CS-41) and a 'Child Support Guidelines' form (Form CS-42)), and if child support is made an issue on appeal, this court will remand (or reverse and remand) for compliance with the rule.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Martin v.

We agree. The record contains no evidence indicating the value of the father's interest in the marital residence; therefore, the trial court erred in granting the father a setoff equal to $13,381, the debt he owed for failing to provide insurance for the children. Accordingly, we reverse the trial court's judgment insofar as it granted the father such a setoff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The mother next argues that the trial court erred by ordering the father to pay prospectively only $200 per month for medical, dental, and optical insurance because, the mother says, \"it appears that the court may have modified the medical support obligation so that the [f]ather became responsible for only $200.00 toward health insurance premiums, rather than including the premiums in an appropriate calculation [of child support].\" Although the mother argued before the trial court that it had erred by ordering the father to pay prospectively only $200 per month for medical, dental, and optical insurance despite the undisputed evidence establishing that the mother was paying $710 per month for such insurance, the mother did not argue before the trial court that it had erred by modifying the father's obligation to provide the children with insurance by reducing that obligation to $200 per month or by failing to include the premiums for such insurance in its calculation of his child-support obligation.

The undisputed evidence indicated that the father was obligated to pay that $250 debt, that he had failed to pay it, and that the mother had paid it. Therefore, the trial court erred in failing to award the mother $250 to reimburse her for paying that debt. Accordingly, we reverse the trial court's judgment insofar as it omitted an award of $250 to reimburse the mother for paying that debt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The mother next argues that the trial court erred by granting the father the option to pay the mother the approximately $2,213 still owed on the parties' credit-card debt by paying her in installments of $100 per month.
