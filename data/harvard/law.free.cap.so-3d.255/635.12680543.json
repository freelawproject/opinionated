For the reasons that follow, we find that the judgment lacks the required decretal language, and is not a final appealable judgment. Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal without prejudice and remand this matter to the district court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On November 20, 2014, plaintiffs filed a petition for damages against the hotel. Plaintiffs alleged that, on November 21, 2013, they were guests of the hotel when they were beaten and robbed in their hotel room by unknown individuals. In their petition, plaintiffs contended that the hotel was negligent in failing to provide plaintiffs with adequate security. On October 31, 2016, the hotel filed a motion for summary judgment arguing that the plaintiffs had no admissible evidence to establish that the hotel breached a duty of care owed to the plaintiffs or that the incident of November 21, 2013 was reasonably foreseeable. Following a hearing on January 6, 2017, the district court took the motion for summary judgment under advisement and permitted the parties to submit post-hearing memoranda.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On December 5, 2017, the district court rendered judgment granting the hotel's motion for summary judgment. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   At the outset, we must first consider whether we have jurisdiction to review this appeal. As this Court explained in\n   <em>\n    Moulton v.

As the court in\n   <em>\n    Contreras\n   </em>\n   explained, \"one must refer to the motion for summary judgment and assume that the relief granted by the judgment is that prayed for in the motion.... [A] judgment cannot require reference to extrinsic documents or pleadings in order to discern the\n   court's ruling.\" 16-318 at p. 2,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=202%20So.%203d%201186\">\n    202 So.3d at 1188\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Here, the district court's December 5, 2017 judgment states, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED\n   </strong>\n   that Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment is hereby\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Applying the above principles to this matter, we find that the judgment does not satisfy the requirements for a final appealable judgment. The judgment does not name the party against whom the ruling is ordered and does not specify what relief is granted. Although the judgment states that it grants the motion for summary judgment, it fails to state what claims, if any, are dismissed and whether the dismissal is with prejudice. Instead, the judgment merely states that the motion for summary judgment is granted. The absence of this necessary decretal language means that the judgment is not final and appealable. We, therefore, lack appellate jurisdiction to address the merits of the appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Under certain circumstances, this Court has exercised its discretion to convert \" 'appeals' of non-appealable judgments to applications for supervisory writs in those cases in which the motions for appeal were filed within the thirty-day period allowed for the filing of applications for supervisory writs.\"\n   <em>\n    Favrot v.

Here, however, the plaintiffs filed a Notice of Intent and Motion to Fix Time for Filing of Appeal on January 8, 2018, thirty-four (34) days after the district court judgment was rendered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Thus, \"while [a] motion for appeal could be construed to be a notice of intent to seek supervisory writs, it could not be construed as a timely one where it was filed more than thirty days from the court's ruling.\"\n   <em>\n    Babineaux v.

We therefore dismiss the plaintiffs' appeal without prejudice and remand for further proceedings. Once a final appealable judgment is rendered, the parties may file a new appeal with this Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Moulton\n   </em>\n   , 2017-0243, p. 7,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12367719\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/226/569/\">\n    226 So.3d at 573\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   For these reasons, the appeal is dismissed without prejudice, and this matter is remanded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    APPEAL DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE; REMANDED\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   BELSOME, J., CONCURS WITH REASONS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   I concur in the result reached by the majority and acknowledge that it is consistent with the jurisprudence, but write separately to address the punitive nature of this result. Giving such weight to the decretal language in a judgment only serves to create delays and additional expense for litigants that are already in a legal system where litigation is prolonged. This outcome not only impedes the progress of the litigation, but also contradicts the principles of judicial efficiency. I disagree with the effects\n   of dismissing an appeal, but also recognize that we are confined by the law on subject matter jurisdiction, and therefore I concur.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
