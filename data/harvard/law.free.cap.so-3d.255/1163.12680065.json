A jury trial commenced on February 8, 2010, following which Defendant was found guilty as charged. Defendant was sentenced on April 19, 2010, to seventy-five years at hard labor without the benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence. Defendant, pro se, timely filed a Motion to Reconsider Sentence. Several weeks later, on May 21, 2010, defense counsel filed a Motion to Reconsider Sentence or, Alternatively, Notice of Appeal. Following a July 30, 2010 hearing, the trial court denied Defendant's motions to reconsider sentence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On June 1, 2016, Defendant filed a \"Motion to Set Status Conference\" to determine the status of the \"unperfected appeal which was filed in this matter on May 21, 2010.\" At the conclusion of an August 10, 2016 hearing, the trial court granted Defendant an out-of-time appeal without objection by the State.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Defendant is now before this court asserting in his sole assignment of error that the trial court's imposition of seventy-five years imprisonment was constitutionally excessive. He argues that the trial court \"did not sufficiently take into account mitigating factors nor did it appropriately tailor the sentence to the defendant for the crime committed.\" For the following reasons, we vacate Defendant's sentence and remand this matter to the trial court for resentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The facts of this matter, which are uncontested for purposes of this appeal, were recited in the State's appellee brief:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   On December 21, 2006, Charles and Angela Fus[i]lier were working at their hair salon. Three men with their faces covered rushed into the salon, waiving guns and demanding money. Although his face was covered, Charles and Angela recognized the defendant, Ruffin Stokes. The defendant pointed his gun at Angela and demanded money. Angela tried to give him what she had, but the defendant pointed the gun at Charles, who threw whatever cash he had in his pocket at the defendant. When Charles could not comply with the defendant's demand for more money, the defendant\n   pointed his gun at Charles' and Angela's three-year-old son. Charles testified that he would rather have died than let the defendant kill his son. Charles tackled the defendant, and, during the struggle, the gun went off, firing a shot into the ceiling.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    State v.

Louisiana Revised Statutes 14:64 provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   A. Armed robbery is the taking of anything of value belonging to another from the person of another or that is in the immediate control of another, by use of force or intimidation, while armed with a dangerous weapon.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   B. Whoever commits the crime of armed robbery shall be imprisoned at hard labor for not less than ten years and for not more than ninety-nine years, without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Defendant argues that the trial court abused its discretion when determining the appropriate length of his sentence because it did not take into consideration as mitigating circumstances that he was only twenty years old and a first-time felony offender when the armed robbery occurred. In brief, Defendant points out that although \"[t]he trial court begins its analysis by noting the defendant's youth; he took it into consideration as an\n   <em>\n    aggravating\n   </em>\n   factor, stating that because of his youthfulness[, Defendant] would likely 'commit additional crimes.' \" Defendant further notes that there is no indication in the record that the trial court considered his lack of criminal history as a mitigating factor. Citing the supreme courts' pronouncement in\n   <em>\n    Quebedeaux\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9544650\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/424/1009/#p1014\">\n    424 So.2d 1009\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , that maximum sentences are generally imposed upon the worst of offenders and the worst of offenses, Defendant argues that his seventy-five-year sentence is unconstitutionally excessive. Thus, he asks this court to vacate his sentence and remand this matter to the trial court for resentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   At the sentencing hearing, the State disclosed that Defendant had no adult criminal record before offering into evidence several Victim Impact Statements. Thereafter, defense counsel asked the trial court for mercy on Defendant because of his youth. The trial court then noted for the record:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   The Court, of course, heard all the testimony. And the testimony was that Mr. Stokes entered this place of business armed with a dangerous weapon, that at first the people who were in there who owned the business didn't think that it was serious because they apparently knew who he was. He had been there before. They knew him. They knew him from the neighborhood. He demanded money. He pointed the weapon. He threatened not only the adults, but also a very young child. He did so in a particularly cruel and heinous manner. He did it deliberately. He did it, the Court found, the jury found deliberately and with some planning.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   The Legislature has deemed armed robbery to be ... one of the most serious crimes that is defined in our code, our Criminal Code and the penalty provision reads as follows: Whoever commits the crime of armed robbery shall be imprisoned at hard labor not less than ten years, nor more than ninety-nine (99) years without benefit of parole, probation or suspension of sentence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   The Victim Impact Statements that I have received show how serious this was and how it has affected the victims of this crime.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   Mr. Stokes deserves a severe penalty. Having committed this crime at a young age with such deliberate and violent intent indicates to the Court that he is a serious offender who would likely commit additional crimes. For that reason[,] the Court is going to impose a sentence of seventy-five (75) years at hard labor without benefit of probation, parole or suspension of sentence. And in imposing this sentence the Court takes into consideration the provisions of Article 894, 895, 894.1, and finds that there is an undue risk that during any period of suspension of sentence or probation the defendant would commit another crime.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   He is in need of correctional treatment and a custodial environment is suitable. A less[e]r sentence would deprecate the seriousness of the offense. The Court does find that this was a particularly heinous crime, that one or more persons could easily been killed as a result of this and that no other or no lesser sentence is appropriate in this case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   According to the trial transcript, Defendant threatened to shoot a three-year-old child because the parents did not come up with enough money. When the father attempted to wrestle the gun from Defendant, the gun discharged. Defendant does not dispute these facts. Fortunately, no one was injured, but Defendant's actions put the Fusiliers and several customers at their salon at serious risk. Defendant essentially terrorized the parents when he aimed the gun at their child and threatened to shoot him if they did not come up with more money.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    State v.

The defendant was a passenger in the getaway car, but was aware of the plan to rob the bank. The presentence report noted the defendant had spent eight months in a juvenile detention center for a prior adjudication for armed robbery.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    State v. Square,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7618837\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/433/104/\">\n    433 So.2d 104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (La.1983), the Louisiana Supreme Court upheld the defendant[']s 25 year sentence for a bank robbery. The defendant was 22 years old, was gainfully employed, lacked a prior criminal record, and there was an absence of personal injury to the victims of the robbery.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   However, in this case, the defendant was charged with nine counts of armed robbery, and one count of conspiracy to commit armed robbery. He was tried on two counts of armed robbery and conspiracy to commit armed robbery, and found guilty. The sentencing range for armed robbery was 5 to 99 years, at the time the instant offenses were committed. The trial court considered the defendant[']s age and reviewed the sentencing guidelines before imposing a 60 year sentence for each count of armed robbery. The defendant's sentences of 60 years on each count of armed robbery, to be served concurrently, fall in that range.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   The issue before us on appeal is whether the trial court abused its discretion, not whether another sentence might have been more appropriate. We apply three factors in reviewing a trial court[']s sentencing discretion: the nature of the crime, the nature and background of the offender, and the sentence imposed for similar crimes. We find in this case that the defendant[']s sentence\n   is not constitutionally excessive. Although, the defendant was nineteen years old and a first time offender, he went on a three-day violent crime spree. While in cases with facts similar to the present one the sentencing range is between 20-40 years, the defendant's sentence of 60 years is within the statutory sentencing range (10-99 years) and does not shock our conscience. The defendant participated in an armed robbery in which victim, Adriene Bazile, testified that she had a gun pointed at her face, which placed her in fear of her life. Bazile testified that she was terrified during the robbery and fell on the floor crying when the robbers, including the defendant, left the bank. Victim, Laura Waguespack, testified that a gun was pointed at her during the robbery, which made her nervous and she feared for herself. Given these factors, we do not find the sentence imposed to be excessive.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 915-17 (footnote omitted).\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

The defendant was a first-time felony offender, nineteen years old at time of the offense, and did not fire a gun during the robbery. The defendant's juvenile record was primarily a chronicle of escapes, and the offense was the first incident of a crime of violence against a person.
