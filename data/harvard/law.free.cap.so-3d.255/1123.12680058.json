The travel plaza and its insurer filed a motion for summary judgment, asserting that the plaintiff would be unable to satisfy her burden of proof that it failed to exercise reasonable care in adequately warning of the wet floor. After the trial court denied the motion for summary judgment, the defendants filed the present application for supervisory writs. For the following reasons, we grant the writ and, by decree below, dismiss the plaintiff's suit against the defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Sybil Schroeder alleged in the petition for damages instituting this matter that she sustained physical injury and related damages when she slipped and fell while in the restroom of a travel plaza on December\n   27, 2014. The plaintiff named Kings Travel Plaza Corp. d/b/a PGS Diner and its insurer as defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The defendants filed a motion for summary judgment asserting that the plaintiff would be unable to satisfy her evidentiary burden of proof at trial that the travel plaza failed to exercise reasonable care in the condition of its floor. In particular, the defendants noted the plaintiff's deposition wherein she explained that she noticed two \"wet floor\" signs before her fall. In opposition, and although she acknowledged having seen \"wet floor\" signs before she fell, the plaintiff asserted that genuine issues of material fact remained due to her allegations that \"[i]t was the excessive amount of water left on the floor and the excessive amount of soap therein that created an unreasonable risk of harm.\" She alleged that such a \"risk of harm is not cured by the use of wet floor signs under the facts at issue in this case.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Following a March 2018 hearing, the trial court denied the defendants' motion for summary judgment. The defendants sought supervisory writs from that denial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   By order dated June 27, 2018, this court granted the writ and allowed the parties time to file additional briefs and to request oral argument pursuant to La.Code Civ.P. art. 966(H). In this regard, La.Code Civ.P. art. 966(H) provides: \"On review, an appellate court shall not reverse a trial court's denial of a motion for summary judgment and grant a summary judgment dismissing a case or a party without assigning the case for briefing and permitting the parties an opportunity to request oral argument.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The parties neither filed additional briefs nor requested oral argument. Accordingly, we turn to consideration of the application by which the defendants challenge the trial court's denial of the motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Louisiana Code of Civil Procedure Article 966 allows a party to seek summary judgment, which \"shall be granted if the motion, memorandum, and supporting documents show that there is no genuine issue as to material fact and that the mover is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" La.Code Civ.P. art 966(A)(3). The burden of proving entitlement to summary judgment \"rests with the mover.\" In cases such as the present, where the defendants are not required to bear the burden of proof at trial, La.Code Civ.P. art. 966(D)(1) provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Nevertheless, if the mover will not bear the burden of proof at trial on the issue that is before the court on the motion for summary judgment, the mover's burden on the motion does not require him to negate all essential elements of the\n   adverse party's claim, action, or defense, but rather to point out to the court the absence of factual support for one or more elements essential to the adverse party's claim, action, or defense. The burden is on the adverse party to produce factual support sufficient to establish the existence of a genuine issue of material fact or that the mover is not entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   A reviewing court considers a trial court's judgment on a motion for summary judgment pursuant to the de novo standard.\n   <em>\n    Larson v.

In a negligence claim brought against a merchant by a person lawfully on the merchant's premises for damages as a result of an injury, death, or loss sustained because of a fall due to a condition existing in or on a merchant's premises, the claimant shall have the burden of proving, in addition to all other elements of his cause of action, all of the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   (1) The condition presented an unreasonable risk of harm to the claimant and that risk of harm was reasonably foreseeable.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   (2) The merchant either created or had actual or constructive notice of the condition which caused the damage, prior to the occurrence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   (3) The merchant failed to exercise reasonable care. In determining reasonable care, the absence of a written or verbal uniform cleanup or safety procedure is insufficient, alone, to prove failure to exercise reasonable care.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   By their motion, the defendants asserted that the plaintiff would be unable to prove that the travel plaza \"failed to exercise reasonable care\" as two \"wet floor\" signs had been placed in or near the restroom where the fall occurred. In support of their motion, the defendants referenced\n   <em>\n    Melancon v.

As in the present matter, the plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Melancon\n   </em>\n   alleged a slip and fall on a recently mopped floor in a commercial establishment. Unlike in the present case, however, the plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Melancon\n   </em>\n   denied the presence of \"wet floor\" signs. Despite such a denial, the panel explained that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Video surveillance from the Popeye's restaurant shows two bright yellow standard \"wet floor\" signs in the Popeye's restaurant-one near the counter and the other at the entrance, both of which are readily visible to anyone entering the store. Upon entering the Popeye's restaurant, Melancon walks directly past a bright yellow \"wet floor\" sign. It then shows her turning from the counter, food in hand, looking directly at a bright yellow mop bucket. She then walks past a \"wet floor\" sign and directly past the employee who is mopping the floor. The only explanation for Melancon's lack of awareness regarding the wet floor is her inattentiveness.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    Melancon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7035131\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/59/513/\">\n    59 So.3d at 515-16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, the panel affirmed the trial court's grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendant merchant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In affirming the trial court's ruling, the\n   <em>\n    Melancon\n   </em>\n   panel rejected the plaintiff's argument that the merchant \"should only mop its floor when the store is closed and that mopping during business hours creates an unreasonable risk of harm.\"\n   <em>\n    Melancon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7035131\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/59/513/\">\n    59 So.3d at 516\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

By that deposition, the plaintiff explained that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   The automatic door opened, there was an industrial grade rug right there. I wiped my feet on the rug. The other door opened, there was another industrial grade rug there. I wiped my feet again. I walked to go to the bathroom.

There was one right there and then there was another one sitting right there.\" The plaintiff subsequently explained that when she stepped into the restroom, she looked at the floor and observed \"[t]hat the floor was wet.\" When counsel inquired as to the subsequent events, the plaintiff responded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   A. I continued to walk in. I passed up these two stalls and I went to the handicapped. The door was open.

Upon entering King's Plaza I decided to use the lady's restroom to my left. As I approached the lady's restroom, I noticed a wet floor sign and consciously exercised more caution as I entered the lady's room.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   3. Despite exercising increased caution, I fell on the floor in the King's Plaza lady's room. Once on the ground, I realized that my clothing was soaking wet and that the amount of water and disinfectant smelling and slippery component of the water was extreme. The floor was so wet, that hours later after my daughter met me at the emergency room, went to King's Plaza and picked up [my] car that my clothes were still soaking wet. Obviously[,] a damp floor from normal mopping would not saturate my clothes to remain soaking wet for hours.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   By her attached memorandum in opposition, the plaintiff thus asserted that the floor created an unreasonable risk of harm and that the \"risk of harm [was] not cured by the use of wet floor signs under the facts at issue in this case.\" The plaintiff further cited jurisprudence for the proposition that: \"It is well settled law in Louisiana that floors which are wet from mopping have been found to [ ] create [an] unreasonable risk of harm that is reasonably\n   foreseeable.\"\n   <em>\n    Citing\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Harrison v.
