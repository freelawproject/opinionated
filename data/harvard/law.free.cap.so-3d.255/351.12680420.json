We withdraw our opinion issued on July 25, 2018, and substitute the following opinion in its place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The defendant physician and his medical practice (collectively \"the physician\") appeal from a jury verdict finding that the physician's negligent supervision of an advanced registered nurse practitioner (\"ARNP\") caused the death of a patient at a drug detoxification facility. The physician raises several arguments on appeal. We conclude the trial court erred in two respects: (1) by precluding the physician from testifying that he was not at the detox facility when the patient was admitted, and was not notified of the patient's existence until after the patient died; and (2) by instructing the jury that the physician's alleged violation of section 458.348, Florida Statutes (2011), was evidence of negligence. We reverse and remand for a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     <em>\n      Procedural History\n     </em>\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The physician served as the detox facility's medical director as an independent contractor. The ARNP was hired to provide nursing services for the facility as an independent contractor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The ARNP's services included evaluating patients to determine whether they could be admitted into the facility or instead required hospital emergency room treatment. The ARNP was permitted to perform these services pursuant to\n   sections 464.003(2) and 464.012(3), Florida Statutes (2011), which define the acts that an ARNP is permitted to perform under a physician's general supervision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   To perform under the physician's general supervision at this facility, the ARNP executed a \"Collaborative Practice Agreement\" with the physician. Under the agreement, the ARNP was authorized to perform any service for which she was licensed to practice, including admitting patients into the detox facility. As to the physician's responsibilities, the agreement provided, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   The physician shall provide general supervision for routine health care and management of common health problems, and provide consultation and/or accept referrals for complex health problems. The physician shall be available by telephone or by other communication devices when not physically available on the premises. If the physician is not available, his associate as assigned will serve as backup for consultation, collaboration and/or referral purpose.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   When the physician entered into the agreement, he was supervising \"probably around eight\" ARNPs at five to seven different facilities through similar agreements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   One evening, the patient arrived at the detox facility sometime before 8:00 p.m. At that time, the ARNP, but not the physician, was at the facility. The detox facility staff told the ARNP that the patient had track marks consistent with intravenous drug use. Later in the evening, when the ARNP checked on the patient, he was sitting upright, speaking, and his vital signs were improving. The ARNP's clinical assessment was that the patient was experiencing withdrawal. Her plan was to begin the detox process the next morning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Significantly, the ARNP did not contact the physician for consultation or review. Thus, the physician did not know of the patient's existence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The ARNP left the detox facility around 11:00 p.m. Before leaving, she instructed the facility's staff to do a bed check on the patient every fifteen minutes and take his vital signs every thirty minutes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Tragically, sometime in the early hours of the following morning, the patient died. The detox facility staff did not discover the patient's death until they checked on him hours later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The medical examiner's autopsy concluded that the patient's cause of death was endocarditis, which is an acute bacterial infection of the inner lining of his heart chamber and valves. The medical examiner further concluded that the patient's recent intravenous drug use contributed to the endocarditis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The patient's estate later sued the physician, the ARNP, and the detox facility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The estate's claim against the physician ultimately was pled as a claim for negligent supervision of the ARNP. In the second amended complaint, the estate alleged that the physician violated a duty arising from section 464.012 to \"maintain supervision for directing the specific course of medical treatment\" rendered by the ARNP. The estate further alleged that the physician failed to comply with section 458.348, Florida Statutes (2011), by exceeding the maximum number of offices he could supervise in addition to his own primary practice location at the time of this incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The physician later moved for partial summary judgment, essentially arguing that, as a physician, he owed no duty of care under section 464.012, because ARNPs are the subject of that statute. The trial court denied the motion, holding that, to the extent section 464.012 required\n   an ARNP to work under a physician's supervision, section 464.012 created a duty of care for the manner in which the physician supervised the ARNP.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The estate ultimately entered into a settlement agreement with the ARNP and the detox facility. The estate's case against the physician was set for trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Before trial, the physician moved in limine to exclude evidence of his having exceeded the maximum number of offices he could supervise under section 458.348. The trial court denied that motion as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   During the trial, the trial court sustained the estate's objections to the physician's attempt to testify that he was not at the detox facility during the ARNP's treatment of the patient and did not know of the patient's existence until after the patient's death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   During closing argument, the estate argued that the physician should be held liable because he violated his duties under sections 464.012 and 458.348.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The trial court instructed the jury that the physician's alleged violation of sections 464.012 and 458.348 was \"evidence of negligence,\" and that if it found that he \"violated the statute[s], you may consider that fact, together with the other facts and circumstances in deciding whether [he] was negligent.\" The physician objected to these instructions. The trial court overruled the objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The jury returned a verdict finding that the physician's negligent supervision was a legal cause of the patient's death, and the estate's damages amounted to $1,312,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     <em>\n      Appellate Analysis\n     </em>\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The physician raises several arguments on appeal. We conclude the trial court erred in two respects: (1) by precluding the physician from testifying that he was not at the detox facility when the patient was admitted, and that he was not notified of the patient's existence until after the patient died; and (2) by instructing the jury that the physician's alleged violation of section 458.348 was evidence of negligence, because the estate did not present any evidence that such violation caused or contributed to the patient's death. We address those errors in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     1.\n     <em>\n      Error in Precluding the Physician's Testimony\n     </em>\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On the first error, although \"[t]he determination of relevancy is within the discretion of the trial court,\" and \"an appellate court will not overturn that decision absent a clear abuse of discretion,\" \"[a] trial court's discretion in determining the relevancy of evidence ... is limited by the rules of evidence and applicable case law.\"\n   <em>\n    Thigpen v.

The error was not harmless, and the evidence was not cumulative. Although other evidence was presented on this point, the physician was not provided the opportunity to testify fully on this key point.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     2.\n     <em>\n      Error in Instructing the Jury on Section 458.348\n     </em>\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   On the second error, our standard of review was detailed in\n   <em>\n    Barton Protective Services, Inc. v.

A decision to give or withhold a jury instruction is to be reviewed under the abuse of discretion standard of review.

Rather, the evidence was undisputed that the ARNP did not contact the physician about the patient because, as she testified, \"[i]n my clinical decision, he was okay to stay. And typically [the physician] would depend on me to be able to see and give a proper and quality assessment, which I did. I could not have known [the patient] ha[d] bacterial endocarditis.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Because the estate presented no proximate cause evidence, the trial court's jury instruction that the physician's violation of section 458.348 was \"evidence of negligence,\" and that if the jury found that he \"violated the statute[s], you may consider that fact, together with the other facts and circumstances in deciding whether [he] was negligent,\" was reasonably calculated to confuse or mislead the jury. Without proximate cause evidence, the jury instruction served no purpose. Thus, the trial court erred in giving the instruction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   This error was not harmless. Because the trial court gave the jury instruction, a reasonable possibility exists that a juror who believed the estate did not prove its negligent supervision claim may nevertheless have held the physician liable simply because he violated section 458.348.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Special v.

It is the legislative intent that\n   <em>\n    nurses\n   </em>\n   who fall below minimum competency or who otherwise present a danger to the public shall be prohibited from practicing in this state.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Further, section 464.012, Florida Statutes (2011), proscribes the steps by which a nurse may become certified as an \"advanced registered nurse practitioner\" (ARNP), and describes the acts which an ARNP may perform. As a prelude to describing the acts which an ARNP may perform, section 464.012(3), Florida Statutes (2011), provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   An advanced registered nurse practitioner shall perform those functions authorized in this section within the framework of an established protocol that is filed with the board upon biennial license renewal and within 30 days after entering into a supervisory relationship with a physician or changes to the protocol. The board shall review the protocol to ensure compliance with applicable regulatory standards for protocols. The board shall refer to the department licensees submitting protocols that are not compliant with the regulatory standards for protocols.\n   <em>\n    A practitioner currently licensed under chapter 458, chapter 459, or chapter 466 shall maintain supervision for directing the specific course of medical treatment.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   (emphasis added). It is from this single emphasized sentence that the estate argued, and the trial court found, a statutory duty of care exists under section 464.012 for those physicians who supervise ARNPs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   I disagree with that finding. Given chapter 464's title of \"Nursing,\" chapter 464's Part I title of \"Nurse Practice Act,\" section 464.002's plain language statement that the \"\n   <em>\n    sole legislative purpose\n   </em>\n   in enacting this part\" is to regulate nurses, and section 464.012's wholesale discussion of ARNPs, it cannot be logically concluded from the single emphasized sentence that physicians' behavior is the subject of section 464.012, from which a duty of care may be created upon physicians.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Rather, ARNPs' behavior is the subject of section 464.012, from which a duty of care may be created upon ARNPs. As applied, if an ARNP performs acts\n   <em>\n    not supervised\n   </em>\n   by a practitioner currently licensed under chapter 458, chapter 459, or chapter 466, then an ARNP may be held\n   liable under section 464.012.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Siegel v.
