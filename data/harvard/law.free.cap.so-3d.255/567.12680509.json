I would grant and docket the defendant's application in this matter to explore whether the trial court erred in delivering what the court of appeal deemed to be a \"compressed\" jury instruction regarding the factors used to determine whether a condition is open and obvious.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Broussard v.
