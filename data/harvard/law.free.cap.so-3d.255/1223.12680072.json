Brown\n   This appeal involves an insurance policy coverage dispute between RSUI Indemnity Company (\"RSUI\") and its Insured, the St. Bernard Parish Government (the \"SBPG\") and its elected and appointed officials. The plaintiffs, ParaTech, LLC (\"ParaTech\"), Richard Perniciaro (\"Mr. Perniciaro\"), and Robert Cleveland (\"Mr. Cleveland\") (collectively, \"the Plaintiffs\") filed a petition for damages against the SBPG and several of its council members\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   -Guy Mclnnis (\"Mr. McInnis\"), Ray Lauga, Jr. (\"Mr. Lauga\"), Casey W. Hunnicutt (\"Mr. Hunnicutt\"), and Richard Lewis (\"Mr. Lewis\") (collectively the \"Parish\"), and RSUI.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   RSUI filed a Motion for Summary Judgment contesting coverage. On September 1, 2017, the district court granted RSUI's motion for summary judgment and dismissed with prejudice all of Plaintiffs' direct action claims against RSUI. The Parish appeals, seeking review of this judgment. For the reasons set forth below, the district court's judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Mr. Perniciaro was a member/owner of ParaTech.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   On behalf of ParaTech, he entered into a contract with the SBPG to provide Information Technology (\"IT\") services to the SBPG. Mr. Perniciaro averred that on October 27, 2014, he was informed by a Council Member, Mr. McInnis, that the St. Bernard Parish Council (the \"Parish Council\") planned to hire Todd's Technology (\"Todd's\") to provide IT services and to establish a separate computer system for the Parish Council.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Subsequently, between November 2014 and July 2015, the Parish Council passed several ordinances that mandated the Parish President to sign the contract with Todd's; that terminated the contract with ParaTech; that restricted ParaTech's access to the public buildings and computer systems; and that defunded the parish's IT department which resulted in ParaTech having outstanding invoices. Although the Parish President vetoed the ordinances, the Parish Council voted to override the vetoes. ParaTech's contract was officially terminated in July, 2015. The dispute between ParaTech and the Council Members\n   was reported by news agencies-the Times Picayune and WGNO television New Orleans. Several of the Council Members were quoted in the news stories.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On November 7, 2014, ParaTech filed, in St. Bernard Parish, a \"Petition for Damages, Breach of Contract, and Request for a Temporary Restraining Order\" (\"Para I\") against the SBPG alleging breach of contract, intentional interference with contract, negligence, and defamation. Additionally, ParaTech sought to enjoin the SBPG from contracting or commencing IT work with any person or company other than ParaTech.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   ParaTech filed an amended petition which named RSUI as a Defendant. RSUI issued a \"Directors and Officers Liability Policy\" to the SBPG. There were two policies issued during the relevant time period. One policy covered February 1, 2014 to February 1, 2015;\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   the second policy covered February 1, 2015 to February 1, 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Both were claims-made-reported policies which contained identical pertinent language.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the policy, \"Insured Persons\" included the SBPG and its elected and appointed officials. The policy required RSUI to defend the Insured against any claim for which coverage applied under the policy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On October 27, 2015, Plaintiffs filed, in Jefferson Parish, a \"Petition for Damages\" (\"Para II\"). In Para II, the named defendants were Messrs. McInnis, Lauga, Hunnicutt, and Lewis, individually and in their capacity as council members for the SBPG, the SBPG, and RSUI.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs alleged claims of defamation and injury against those Defendants and set forth a general allegation of \"[a]ny and all other negligent and/or intentional acts perpetrated ... which will be proven or identified by discovery.\" Due to improper venue, Para II was dismissed without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On August 5, 2016, Plaintiffs filed, in St. Bernard Parish, a \"Petition for Damages\" (\"Para III\") which is the instant suit. Para III named the same parties and alleged the same causes of action as Para II.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Particularly, Plaintiffs alleged Messrs. McInnis, Lauga, Hunnicutt, and Lewis, personally and as council members of the SBPG, and the SBPG were liable to Plaintiffs for negligent and/or intentional acts which included:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   \u2022 Defaming and injuring the Plaintiffs by their public statements to the press and others;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   \u2022 Defaming and injuring the Plaintiffs by entering into an illegal contract with Todd's and that contract was recorded in the public record;\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   \u2022 Defaming and injuring the Plaintiffs by initiating and voting on illegal ordinances that terminated ParaTech's contract with the parish, prevented\n   ParaTech from entering any public building in the parish, and refused to pay money owed to ParaTech all in violation of the St. Bernard Parish Charter; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   \u2022 \"Any and all other negligent and/or intentional acts... which will be proven or identified through discovery.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Messrs. Perniciaro and Cleveland sought damages for public embarrassment and humiliation, mental anguish and anxiety, loss of income, loss of earning capacity, loss of enjoyment of life, and loss of and damage to reputation. ParaTech prayed for damages for loss of business, loss of business partners and members, and loss of and damage to its reputation in the industry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On March 29, 2017, RSUI filed a motion for summary judgment asserting the following grounds:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \u2022 The SBPG untimely notified RSUI of the claims asserted by ParaTech in Para I. RSUI asserted the petition in Para I was served on November 12, 2014, but the claim was not reported to RSUI until August 31, 2015. RSUI explained the applicable policy required a claim to be reported during the policy period, not to exceed sixty days after the expiration date of the policy;\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   \u2022 The claims alleged by ParaTech in Para III are deemed to be a single claim which arose in Para I. Because the single claim was untimely reported by the SBPG, RSUI did not owe the SBPG a defense; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-23\">\n   \u2022 The policies excluded coverage for Plaintiffs' claims of breach of contract, defamation, and mental anguish.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Before the hearing on the motion for summary judgment was held, the Council Members filed a motion to compel discovery and a notice to depose RSUI, pursuant to La. C.C.P. art. 1442.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   In response, RSUI filed a motion to quash the notice of deposition, requested a protective order, and filed an opposition to the motion to compel. On June 14, 2017, a hearing was held, and the district court rendered judgment on June 20, 2017, denying the Council Members' motion to compel, and granting RSUI's motion to quash and request for a protective order.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On August 22, 2017, the district court heard RSUI's motion for summary judgment. The district court's judgment, rendered on September 1, 2017, provided in pertinent part:\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-26\">\n   [T]he Court finds there is no coverage afforded to St. Bernard Parish Government, Guy McInnis, Ray Lauga, Jr., Casey W. Hunnicutt, and Richard Lewis\n   under RSUI Directors and Officers Liability Policy no. HP655864 (2/1/2014-2/1/2015) and RSUI Directors and Officers Liability Policy no. HP661160 (2/1/2015-2/1/2016) for Plaintiffs claims, and there is a judgment herein dismissing with prejudice all claims asserted by Plaintiffs against RSUI ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   From this judgment, the Parish appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On appeal, the Parish assigns essentially two errors: (1) the district court erred in denying the Council Members' motion to compel discovery and request to depose RSUI, and granting RSUI's motion to quash and protective order; and (2) the district court erred in granting the summary judgment based on certain policy exclusions including excluding coverage for Plaintiffs' general tort liability claims; in considering an argument not raised by the moving party contrary to La. C.C.P. art. 966(f) ; and by finding Plaintiffs' claims asserted in Para III fell outside of the policy period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    Discovery\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Parish asserts the district court erred by denying the Council Member's motion to compel discovery and notice to depose RSUI and by granting RSUI's motion to quash the deposition and protective order. RSUI asserts the Parish untimely seeks review on appeal of the interlocutory rulings. Alternatively, RSUI argues further discovery was not needed for the district court to decide the coverage issue on summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    Collectively referred to as the \"Council Members.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-97\">\n    The Times Picayune, LLC, and Benjamin Alexander-Bloch are also named as Defendants in the instant suit but are not the subject of RSUI's motion for summary judgment.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-98\">\n    Mr. Cleveland was also a member/owner of ParaTech.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-99\">\n    Other representatives from the SBPG were also present at the meeting.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-100\">\n    Policy number HP655864.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-101\">\n    Policy number HP661160.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-102\">\n    \"Claim\" is generally defined in the policy as \"a written demand for monetary or non-monetary relief [.]\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-103\">\n    The record is unclear as to the disposition of the first suit filed by Plaintiffs.

Although oral reasons are not reviewable by an appellate court, they may be insightful. In the case\n    <em>\n     sub judice\n    </em>\n    , the district court espoused that the claims asserted in Para I were not timely reported to RSUI; the dismissal of Para II resulted in the claims being dismissed; the claims asserted in Para III were averred outside of the policy period; and the policy excluded coverage for claims for breach of contract, defamation, mental anguish, emotional distress, and loss of income.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    In\n    <em>\n     Sporl v.

The Parish points to the lack of responses in the answer to interrogatories by RSUI; markedly, the lack of \"substantive responses to interrogatories involving the underwriting process or drafting of the policy terms (footnotes omitted).\" Additionally, the Parish contends that the Article 1442 deposition of RSUI was necessary to determine the history of drafting and application of the provisions relied on by RSUI to exclude coverage.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    \"In ruling upon discovery matters, the trial court is vested with broad discretion and, upon review, an appellate court should not disturb such rulings absent a clear abuse of discretion.\"\n    <em>\n     Channelside Servs., LLC v.

A fact is material when its existence or nonexistence may be essential to the plaintiff's cause of action under the applicable theory of recovery; a fact is material if it potentially insures or precludes recovery, affects a litigant's ultimate success, or\n    determines the outcome of the legal dispute.

As to the Coverage Issue, I agree with the majority's findings that certain policy exclusions apply to relieve RSUI of its obligation to defend and to indemnity the Parish for the Plaintiffs'\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    claims; however, I write separately to articulate my analysis of the this issue.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    To place the Coverage Issue in context, it is necessary to outline briefly the factual and procedural background of the case. Factually, RSUI issued two claims-made-and-reported officer and directors liability policies to the SBPG-one having a policy period of February 1, 2014, to February 1, 2015; the other, February 1, 2015, to February 1, 2016. Although the policy periods differ, the pertinent policy terms are the same. The instant suit, which falls within the 2015 to 2016 policy, is the Plaintiffs' third suit arising out of the same factual scenario-the termination of the contract for information technology (\"IT\") services between the SBPG and ParaTech, LLC (\"ParaTech\") (the \"IT Contract\"). The three suits are as follows:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n    \u2022\n    <strong>\n     Suit One\n    </strong>\n    -filed: November 7, 2014; venue: 34th Judicial District Court, Parish of St. Bernard; plaintiff: ParaTech; and defendants: the SBPG and RSUI.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n    \u2022\n    <strong>\n     Suit Two\n    </strong>\n    -filed: October 27, 2015; venue: 24th Judicial District Court, Parish of Jefferson; plaintiffs: ParaTech and its individual owners and members Richard Perniciaro, and Robert Cleveland; and defendants: the SBPG; RSUI; the Council Members; and the media defendants.\n    <footnotemark>\n     3\n    </footnotemark>\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n    \u2022\n    <strong>\n     Suit Three\n    </strong>\n    (the instant suit)-filed: August 5, 2016; venue: 34th Judicial District Court, Parish of St. Bernard; plaintiffs: ParaTech, Mr. Perniciaro, and Mr. Cleveland; and defendants: the SBPG; RSUI; the Council Members; and the media defendants.\n    <footnotemark>\n     4\n    </footnotemark>\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    Suit One and Suit Two are relevant to the instant suit only insofar as those suits form the basis of the timeliness issue raised by RSUI regarding the Parish's presentation of its insurance claim to RSUI, so as to trigger coverage under the 2015 to 2016 policy.\n    <footnotemark>\n     5\n    </footnotemark>\n    The majority pretermits the timeliness issue based on its finding that three policy exclusions, raised by RSUI in support of its motion for summary judgment, apply here. I agree and, thus, focus solely on the exclusions.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    The three pertinent policy exclusions are as follows: (i) the defamation exclusion; (ii) the mental anguish or emotional distress exclusion; and (iii) the \"breach-of-contract\" exclusion. The application of the defamation and the mental anguish or emotional distress exclusions is straightforward. As the trial court noted in its oral reasons for judgment, \"[t]he claim, for defamation, I think, is plain and simple. Everything that is a defamation claim, I think, is certainly excluded by the defamation exclusion. And all of the other claims of mental anguish are certainly excluded by the mental anguish, emotional distress exclusion.\" Because the correctness of the trial court's reasoning is not disputed, those two exclusions require no further analysis. The application of the \"breach-of-contract\" exclusion, on the other hand, is the crux of the instant appeal. Indeed, it subsumes all of the Parish's arguments.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    The trial court, in its oral reasons for judgment, construed the \"breach-of-contract\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    exclusion as \"all encompassing,\" reasoning as follows: \"[a]ll the claims made by the plaintiff[s] ... had to do with the efforts of St. Bernard Parish Government to disassociate itself, terminate the contract, get away from, kick out of the building Mr. Perniciaro, his companies. It all has to do with that.\" On appeal, the Parish contends that the trial court erred in finding the \"breach-of-contract\" exclusion dispositive. The Parish's argument can be divided into the following three categories: (i) claims involving non-parties to the IT Contract; (ii) claims that are non-contractual in nature; and (iii) the \"catch-all\" claim in the Plaintiffs' petition. I separately address each category.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    <em>\n     Claims Involving Non-Parties\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    As the majority points out, \"[t]he Parish argues, in its reply brief, that the breach of contract exclusion does not apply to the Council Members, and Messrs. Perniciaro and Cleveland because they were not a party to the [IT] [C]ontract-just the SBPG and ParaTech.\" The majority pretermits this issue given that it was not raised in the trial court. I would address this issue.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    This issue is resolved by the plain language of RSUI's policy setting forth the \"breach-of-contract\" exclusion; particularly, the policy provides that an insured loss excludes claims:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n    Alleging, arising out of, based upon or attributable to, in whole or in part, any liability under or pursuant to any contract or agreement, whether oral, written, express or implied, including the liability of others assumed by an Insured, unless such Insured would have been liable in the absence of such contract or agreement; provided, this EXCLUSION shall not apply to Defense Expenses in connection with an Employment Practices Claim[.]\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    Construing the same policy language, the federal district court in\n    <em>\n     RSUI Indemnity Co. v. McDonough County Hospital d/b/a McDonough County Hospital District, and Women's Health Center of Macomb, S.C.\n    </em>\n    , Labor &amp; Empl. L. \u00b6 221585 (C.C.H.) (U.S. District Court, C.D. Ill., September 28, 2017) (\n    <em>\n     unpub.\n    </em>\n    ),\n    <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%204319117\">\n     2017 WL 4319117\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , rejected an insured's argument that the exclusion was only intended to apply to liability-producing contracts to which the insured, McDonough, was a party. In reaching this result, the district court reasoned that \"the contract [exclusion], by its terms, applies to any claim based upon liability under any contract.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%204319117\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    The district court further reasoned that \"by the exclusion's terms, it does not matter who the parties to the contract are, and thus, whether or not the insured is a party to the liability-producing contract is not dispositive of whether the exclusion applies. The claim just has to be based on or attributable to a contract.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%204319117\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    Moreover, the district court in\n    <em>\n     McDonough\n    </em>\n    observed, as RSUI's counsel pointed out at oral argument before this court, that RSUI's policy exclusion, by its express terms, is actually a \"contract\" exclusion, not a \"breach-of-contract\" exclusion. Given the language of RSUI's contract exclusion does not restrict its scope to the parties to the liability-producing contract, the Parish's argument that the exclusion does not extend to non-parties to the IT Contract is unpersuasive.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    <em>\n     Claims That Are Non-Contractual in Nature\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    The Parish's next argument is that the contract exclusion does not extend to non-contractual claims. The Parish cites the well-settled jurisprudential principle that the same act can give rise to both contractual and tort claims.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Borden, Inc. v. Howard Trucking Co.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7632848\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/454/1081/#p1096\">\n     454 So.2d 1081\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1096 (La. 1983) (observing that \"a party can incur liability in tort, notwithstanding a contractual relationship between parties,\n    ... where the act causing the damage constitutes both a breach of contract and legal fault\"). The Parish contends that the trial court erred in failing to recognize that this principle applies here. Nonetheless, the Parish acknowledges that the \"but for\" test, which the majority discusses in detail, determines the applicability of the \"breach-of-contract\" exclusion. Under the \"but for\" test, \"the injury is only considered to have arisen out of the contractual breach if the injury would not have occurred but for the breach of contract.\"\n    <em>\n     Looney Ricks Kiss Architects, Inc. v.

In\n    <em>\n     McInnis\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , the appellate court summarized the allegations of the Plaintiffs' petition in Suit Two-which, save a few words, are essentially verbatim to those in Suit Three-as follows:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n    Plaintiffs' claims against defendants arose out of an IT professional services contract between ParaTech and the St. Bernard Parish Government that was terminated by an ordinance passed by the St. Bernard Parish Council. The suit alleged specific causes of action against each defendant regarding events surrounding the contract and its eventual termination. First, plaintiffs alleged that the Councilmen were liable for various acts of defamation and conspiracy perpetrated against plaintiffs by the Councilmen as members of the St. Bernard Parish Government and in their own personal and individual capacities. These actions included providing defamatory statements to the press about plaintiffs; conspiring with other parish officials to sign an \"illegal contract\" with another IT company, Todd's Technology; stating false and misleading \"facts\" about Mr. Perniciaro to Mr. Cleveland and attempting to persuade Mr. Cleveland to leave ParaTech; and for initiating and/or voting for four \"illegal\" ordinances terminating ParaTech's contract with St. Bernard Parish, preventing plaintiffs from entering any parish building, and refusing to pay money owed to plaintiffs. As to the St. Bernard Parish Government, plaintiffs alleged that, through its parish councilmembers, employees, directors, officers, and contractors, it defamed and injured plaintiffs though defamatory public statements to the press, as well as through the above-listed actions of the Councilmen. The petition also alleged that RSUI was liable because it provided a policy of liability insurance to the St. Bernard Parish Government.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    16-740 at pp. 1-2, 222 So.3d at 988-89.

The plaintiff and Island Park, LLC, as represented by Mr. Bryan, in 1996, entered into a Standard Form of Agreement Between Owner and Architect wherein the plaintiff \"\n     <em>\n      retain[ed] all common law, statutory, and other reserved rights, including the copyright\"\n     </em>\n     and the\n     <em>\n      \"Technical Drawings\n     </em>\n     or other documents\n     <em>\n      shall not be used by the Owner or others on other projects, for additions to this Project or for completion of this Project by others\n     </em>\n     .\"\n     <em>\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3872001\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/677/250/\">\n       Id.\n      </extracted-citation>\n     </em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3872001\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/677/250/\">\n      at 253-54\n     </extracted-citation>\n     (emphasis in the original). The plaintiff registered the Island Park Apartments with the United States Copyright Office as an Architectural Work and Technical Drawings. The suit arose when Cypress Lake Development, a company associated with Bryan, applied for and obtained permits to construct the Cypress Lake Apartments in Baton Rouge, Louisiana; the plaintiff alleged that these apartments infringed on its copyrighted work without his consent or permission. The district granted a summary judgment, in part, in favor of the defendants' insurers finding no coverage under the insurance policy for breach of contract. On appeal, the United States Fifth Circuit, applying the \"but for\" test, reversed the district court and held that \"[a]s [the plaintiffs] claim for relief under the federal copyright laws would exist even in the absence of its 1996 Agreement with Bryan, the 'breach of contract' provisions of the relevant insurance policies do not apply to preclude coverage ....\"\n     <em>\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3872001\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/677/250/\">\n       Id.\n      </extracted-citation>\n     </em>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3872001\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/677/250/\">\n      677 F.3d at 257\n     </extracted-citation>\n     .\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"22\">\n    <p id=\"p-124\">\n     The district court granted summary judgment as to the contractor's insurance carrier finding the policy provided no coverage for the tort claims alleged in plaintiffs' petition, and the insurance company had no duty to defend the contractor against those claims.\n     <em>\n      Everett,\n     </em>\n     2008-2270, p. 2 (La.
