Alabama\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/\">\n    567 U.S. 460\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/\">\n    132 S.Ct. 2455\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/\">\n    183 L.Ed.2d 407\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012). Without complying with the guidelines set out by\n   <em>\n    State v. Touchet\n   </em>\n   , 93-2839 (La. 9/6/94),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7470071\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/642/1213/\">\n    642 So.2d 1213\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , defense counsel specifically requested public funds for the hiring of \"a mitigation investigator, a fact investigator, a psychologist, an expert in trauma and a prison adjustment expert,\" arguing that the rules of capital sentencing should apply in a non-capital sentencing hearing. While I agree with the decisions of the lower courts denying such relief on the showing made, I would grant and docket this case in order for this Court to address the defense's analogy to a capital penalty hearing. Moreover, there is a growing need for this Court to set specific parameters and guidelines concerning the scope of a hearing pursuant to both\n   <em>\n    Miller,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/\">\n     supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Montgomery v. Louisiana\n   </em>\n   , 577 U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12601432\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/718/\">\n    136 S.Ct. 718\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12601432\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/718/\">\n    193 L.Ed.2d 599\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The issue in such cases is ultimately whether or not a defendant, who committed such crimes as a juvenile, is entitled to parole eligibility at a certain point of incarceration. As I have previously written, in making this determination, a court should focus on the facts of the underlying conviction and defendant's criminal history, if any, as well as the defendant's behavior record during confinement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Education, family background, and issues of family support would also likely prove helpful in the judge's determination. In this matter, while defense counsel has made no showing whatsoever for the necessity of public money for the five experts, I do believe that the Court has passed on a valuable opportunity to weigh in on the important issues bearing on a\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   hearing, and consequently, I would grant and docket the defendant's writ application for the Court to provide much needed guidance in this regard.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-13\">\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     State of Louisiana v.
