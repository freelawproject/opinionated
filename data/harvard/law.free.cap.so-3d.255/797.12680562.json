Bearden and Donald Terry Bearden were convicted of reckless endangerment, a violation of \u00a7 13A-6-24, Ala. Code 1975, following a bench trial in the Talladega District Court. The Beardens were sentenced to six months in jail. However, their sentences were suspended, and each was ordered to serve six months of unsupervised probation. Additionally, the Beardens were each ordered to pay a $500 fine and court costs. This appeal follows.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The evidence at trial indicated that the Beardens' neighbor, Jill Hyner, left her home in the early morning hours of April 21, 2016, to go to work. Hyner testified that someone shined a bright spotlight from the Beardens' property into her vehicle as she pulled out of her driveway and drove to a stop sign at the end of her street. Hyner stated that the beam of light was initially a single beam but that, at some point, changed to a \"strobe light.\" (R. 24.) The light, according to Hyner, blinded her and hindered her ability to see other vehicles on the road. Hyner testified that this type of incident had happened on other occasions when she left her home in the mornings. A few days before the incident in question, Hyner contacted police who advised her to change her schedule to see if the incidents would stop. However, Hyner testified that someone on the Beardens' porch continued to shine a spotlight into her car despite her altered schedule. Based on that allegation, two police officers set up surveillance in front of the Beardens' house on the morning of April 21, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Jason Murray, an officer with the Talladega County Drug Task Force, testified that he and another officer sat in the woods across from the Beardens' house in the early morning hours of April 21, 2016. Officer Murray testified that, at approximately 5:15 that morning, Hyner got into her car and left for work. According to Officer Murray, someone from the Beardens' porch then began to shine a light across the fence toward Hyner's house. Officer Murray stated: \"As soon as [Hyner] got into the car and pulled out of her driveway, they turned the flashlight back on at the corner of the fence and followed her all the way down to the stop sign until she turned to go out of sight.\" (R. 74-75.) Officer Murray testified that the beam of light was shining into the driver's side\n   window of Hyner's car and alternated between a single beam of light and a strobe light. Officer Murray and his partner then came out of the woods and approached the Beardens' porch, where they discovered Mollie M. Bearden holding a flashlight. Officer Murray placed Mrs. Bearden under arrest for reckless endangerment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Further testimony revealed that, on the morning following Mollie Bearden's arrest, Hyner again left for work early in the morning. Hyner stated that, as she drove to work, Donald Terry Bearden followed her in his vehicle for approximately 10 miles. According to Hyner, Donald Bearden followed her very closely and continuously shined his high beams into her car. Hyner stated that the lights caused her to have difficulty seeing road signs and oncoming traffic. Hyner also testified that, at one point, Donald Bearden pulled his vehicle alongside her car causing her to believe that he might try to run her off the road. Additional testimony revealed that the road on which they were traveling was a two-lane road; thus, Bearden was driving in the wrong lane when he pulled alongside Hyner. He was later arrested and charged with reckless endangerment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On appeal, the Beardens first argue that the trial court erred when it denied their motion to dismiss the cases against them. According to the Beardens, the complaints charging them with reckless endangerment was insufficient because, they claim, it failed to state particular facts regarding the offense. Specifically, the Beardens claimed that the complaint did not disclose the essential facts of the \"reckless conduct\" they were charged with. Therefore, the Beardens say, they lacked notice of the charges against them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \" '[T]his court has held that a complaint that substantially tracks the language of the statute is sufficient to inform the defendant of the charges against which he must defend.' \"\n   <em>\n    Gentile v. City of Guntersville\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7515520\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/589/809/#p810\">\n    589 So.2d 809\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 810 (Ala. Crim. App. 1991), quoting\n   <em>\n    State v. Franklin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7550323\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/541/593/\">\n    541 So.2d 593\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Ala. Crim. App. 1989). The complaint against Mollie Bearden alleged that, \"on or about the 21st day of April, 2016, one [Mollie M. Bearden] did engage in reckless conduct, which created a substantial risk of injury to another person to-wit: [Jill Hyner], in violation of \u00a7 13A-6-24(a), of the Code of Alabama.\" (C. 37.) The complaint against Donald Bearden alleged that, \"on or about the 22nd day of April, 2016, one [Donald Terry Bearden] did engage in reckless conduct, which created a substantial risk of injury to another person to-wit: [Jill Hyner], in violation of \u00a7 13A-6-24(a), of the Code of Alabama.\" Section 13A-6-24(a), Ala. Code 1975, provides: \"A person commits the crime of reckless endangerment if he recklessly engages in conduct which creates a substantial risk of serious physical injury to another person.\" Thus, the complaints against the Beardens substantially tracked the language of the statute they were charged with violating along with the date the conduct was alleged to have occurred and the victim's name. Accordingly, the complaint was sufficient to put the Beardens on notice of the charges they were called to defend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Moreover, the record refutes any assertion that the Beardens were not aware of the specifics of the charges against them. As noted, Mollie and Donald Bearden were arrested on April 21, 2016, and April 22, 2016, respectively. Defense counsel entered a notice of appearance seven days after Donald Bearden's arrest on April 29, 2016, and subsequently filed several motions. The Beardens then filed a subpoena request with the Talladega County sheriff's office seeking \"any and all incident reports filed by Jill Hyner from\n   January 1, 2014 to present.\" (C. 46.) Additionally, the Beardens filed a subpoena request with Hyner's employer seeking \"Jill Hyner's work hours for each day worked during the period of March 21, 2016 until May 21, 2016.\" (C. 60.) Further, Mollie Bearden testified that, immediately after she was released from jail, she downloaded video footage from her home-surveillance system depicting the incident in question and provided that footage to her attorney. (R. 118.) Despite being in possession of that video footage before trial, defense counsel told the trial court: \"As of this day, I don't know what the allegation is. My clients don't know what the allegation is.\" (R. 8.) However, when defense counsel played the video for the trial court, he stated, \"Judge, I think the video itself is about thirty minutes. But I know where the action starts, so I can cut to the chase.\" (R. 119.) These facts belie any contention that the Beardens were unaware of the charges they were called to defend.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Bexley v.

Code 1975. \"A person acts recklessly with respect to a result or to a circumstance described by a statute defining an offense when he is aware of and consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the result will occur or that the circumstance exists. The risk must be of such nature and degree that disregard thereof constitutes a gross deviation from the standard of conduct that a reasonable person would observe in the situation.\" \u00a7 13A-2-2(3), Ala. Code 1975. As noted above, Jill Hyner testified that someone on the Beardens' property shined a spotlight into her vehicle while she was driving causing her to become \"blinded.\" (R. 23.) Officer Murray witnessed this event and subsequently discovered Mollie Bearden holding a flashlight on her front porch. Viewing this evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, the trial court could have concluded that Mollie Bearden shined a spotlight into Hyner's vehicle, creating a substantial risk that Hyner would wreck her vehicle causing serious physical injury. Based on Hyner's testimony that this type of incident had happened on numerous occasions, the trial court could have determined that Mollie Bearden knew that her conduct created such a risk but that she consciously disregarded it. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in denying Mollie Bearden's motion for a judgment of acquittal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   As to Donald Bearden, the testimony at trial indicated that he followed closely behind Hyner's for approximately 10 miles with his high beams shining into the passenger compartment of Hyner's vehicle. Again, Hyner testified that the bright lights \"blinded\" her. (R. 27.) Accordingly, there was sufficient evidence to show that Donald Bearden's conduct created a substantial risk that Hyner would wreck her vehicle and be seriously injured. Thus, the trial court did not err when it denied Donald Bearden's motion for a judgment of acquittal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In its brief on appeal, the State argues-for the first time-that the Beardens' appeal is not properly before this Court because, it says, the record is not adequate as required by Rule 30.2(1), Ala. R. Crim. P.,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   which provides: \"An appeal\n   from the district or municipal court shall go directly to the appropriate appellate court: (1) If an adequate record or stipulation of fact is available and the right to a jury trial is waived by all parties entitled to trial by jury.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to the State, \"nothing in the record establishes that the district court authorized an official transcript, appointed an official court reporter or special roving court reporter, or administered the required oath.\" (State's brief, at 16), citing\n   <em>\n    Ex parte French\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7548870\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/547/547/\">\n    547 So.2d 547\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Ala. 1989). Further, the State argues, \"there is no evidence that the private court reporter retained by the Beardens was accepted by agreement of both parties.\" (State's brief, at 16), citing\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Burnsed\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9129241\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/844/526/#p528\">\n    844 So.2d 526\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 528 (Ala. 2001).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   However, the record does not suggest, as the State contends, that the court reporter was not an official court reporter authorized by the district court. In reviewing the entire record, there are several instances suggesting that the court reporter who prepared the transcript was an official court reporter authorized by the district court. On the first page of the transcript, the district court judge began the proceedings by stating: \"We're on the Record.\" (R. 6.) Additionally, the district court judge who presided in this matter allowed the court reporter to interrupt the trial numerous times to clarify a witness's answer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ( R. 37, 40, 43, 45, 60, 61, 68, 152.) Finally, the Beardens completed a \"Reporter's Transcript Order\" and included it with the docketing statement to this court. (C. 72.) These facts indicate that the court reporter who prepared the transcript was an official court reporter authorized by the district court. Nothing in the record, besides the State's bare assertion on appeal, suggests otherwise. Obviously, it is the State's burden on appeal to ensure that the facts that support its argument are included in the record. Moreover, there has been no showing or indication, at trial or on appeal, that the record taken by the court reporter was not adequate to support an appeal to this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Even if the State were correct in its assertion that the court reporter in this case was not an official court reporter under Alabama law, the record is nonetheless adequate under Rule 30.2(1), Ala. R. Crim. P. The State appears to argue that, in order for the record to be adequate in the present case, there must be some evidence that the Beardens made a formal demand for a court reporter and that the parties agreed to having a court reporter transcribe the proceedings. However, Rule 30.2(1), Ala. R. Crim. P., contains no such requirements nor does the precedent cited by the State. Under Rule 30.2(1), Ala. R. Crim. P., an appeal from the district court, such as this one, shall go to the appropriate appellate court so long as there is \"an adequate record or stipulation of fact.\" Although a stipulation of fact clearly requires an agreement between the parties, an adequate record is supplied when a record is presented without objection or is found to be adequate by a court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The State appears to cite\n   <em>\n    Ex parte French\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7548870\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/547/547/\">\n    547 So.2d 547\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Ala. 1989), for the principle that an unofficial transcript prepared by a court reporter who has not been appointed in compliance with Alabama law,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 12-17-270 et seq., lacks guarantees of accuracy, impartiality, and\n   authenticity. However,\n   <em>\n    French\n   </em>\n   and the cases cited therein dealt with situations in which an unofficial transcript was being offered as substantive evidence in a trial or other proceeding. Specifically, the transcript in question in\n   <em>\n    French\n   </em>\n   was being offered as an exhibit to support the defendant's motion for a summary judgment. The Alabama Supreme Court held \"that an unofficial transcript, prepared by a person not duly appointed as an official court reporter pursuant to the provisions of Ala. Code 1975, \u00a7\u00a7 12-17-270 through 277, or approved by the adverse party or parties, is\n   <em>\n    inadmissible in a subsequent trial\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7548870\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/547/547/\">\n    547 So.2d at 549\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Woods v.

Thus, there existed a heightened constitutional standard in those cases because the transcripts were being offered as exceptions to the rule against hearsay and, consequently, required substantial guarantees of trustworthiness or other indicia of reliability. In the present case, the only requirement is that the record be \"adequate.\" Additionally, the relevant parties in those cases objected to the admission of the transcripts in the trial court. Accordingly,\n   <em>\n    French\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable from the present case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The facts in the present case are nearly identical to the situation in\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Boswell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7532878\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/558/918/\">\n    558 So.2d 918\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Ala. 1990).

Unlike the case in\n   <em>\n    Boswell\n   </em>\n   , however, there is no evidence in the record indicating that the State shared in the costs of hiring the court reporter with the Beardens. Furthermore, the lack of an objection on the part of the State to the hiring of the private court reporter and the lack of an objection by the State regarding the accuracy of the record has no effect in light of the fact that the court reporter was hired solely by the Beardens. Further, the Beardens' reliance on\n   <em>\n    Burnsed\n   </em>\n   is unavailing, given that the Beardens were tried and convicted in the district court and not in the municipal court as was the defendant in\n   <em>\n    Burnsed\n   </em>\n   . As the Supreme Court noted in\n   <em>\n    Burnsed\n   </em>\n   , district courts are courts of record and, as such, are authorized to appoint a court reporter. The record does not indicate that the Beardens demanded that the district court provide a court reporter or a reporter's transcript. Further, there is no indication that the court reporter who transcribed the trial in this case was duly appointed by the district court as an official court reporter or was administered an oath. See\n   <em>\n    French\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7548870\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/547/547/\">\n    supra.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Although\n   <em>\n    French\n   </em>\n   was a civil case involving the admissibility of an unofficial transcript at a subsequent trial, the concerns regarding the accuracy and impartiality of the reporting in a transcript that were expressed by the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    French\n   </em>\n   also exist in the context of criminal cases. Indeed, given that in a criminal case the defendant could face the loss of his liberty through incarceration, any concerns regarding the accuracy and impartiality of the reporting in a transcript are even more compelling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   In this case, the record contains a transcript prepared by a private court reporter hired by the Beardens to transcribe proceedings in the district court. There is no indication in the record that the court reporter was administered an oath or was otherwise authorized to transcribe the proceedings in the district court. Although the main opinion points to instances suggesting that the court reporter was the official court reporter authorized by the district court, statements such as \"we're\n   on the record\" and interruptions by the court reporter during trial do not, in and of themselves, obviate the need to have some indication on the record that the court reporter was formerly appointed or was administered an oath. Furthermore, nothing in the record indicates that the court reporter was anything more than a private court reporter hired by the Beardens, and, thus, there was no basis for the State to object at that time. Certainly, the better practice would have been for the district court, out of an abundance of caution, to have administered an oath to the court reporter. Therefore, given the particular facts and circumstances of this case, I do not believe that the transcript in this case was an official record and, therefore, I believe that it was not an \"adequate record\" for appeal under Rule 30.2(1). Because the Beardens failed to meet the requirements of Rule 30.2, jurisdiction lies with the circuit court and not with this Court. Accordingly, this appeal is not properly before this Court, and it is due to be dismissed. See\n   <em>\n    Smith v.
