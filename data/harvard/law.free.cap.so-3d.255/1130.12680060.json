OJJ's writ application fails to discuss the procedural history in this matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   District Court Judge Martha O'Neal filed a per curiam with this court. She noted that on January 26, 2018, G.P., who was thirteen years old at the time, entered an admission and was adjudicated delinquent of eleven felonies, which included four counts of simple burglary, violations of La.R.S. 14:62 ; four counts of simple criminal damage to property, violations of La.R.S. 14:56 ; and three counts of simple arson, violations of La.R.S. 14:52. G.P. was then placed in juvenile detention:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-10\">\n   [i]n an unsecured facility or in other placement with other family members until his 18th birthday subject to modification by the Court. The Court further explained to the juvenile that in the event he should decide to leave the unsecured facility, then he would be transferred to a secure facility.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The per curiam indicates a review hearing was held on April 3, 2018, and G.P. was ordered back into his mother's home after his failure to make good choices at Boy's Village. On May 7, 2018, OJJ requested the matter be reviewed because G.P.'s mother refused to comply with the conditions of G.P.'s probation. At a review hearing held on May 15, 2018, OJJ requested, and the court ordered, that G.P. wear an ankle bracelet until a review hearing fixed for October 16, 2018. On May 23, 2018, it was reported that G.P. removed the ankle bracelet, took his mother's car, and absconded. During a foot chase with police, G.P. broke into several homes and was eventually apprehended by DeRidder City Police. Thereafter, G.P.'s parents would not allow him to return home. G.P. returned to court on May 25, 2018, for continued custody and probation revocation hearings. His probation was revoked, and he was ordered in unsecure placement. On June 12, 2018, a new petition for adjudication\n   was filed in district court docket number JC-2018-28. The judge received notice via email from G.P.'s probation officer on July 6, 2018, that G.P. fled from a group home in Baton Rouge. On July 9, 2018, the judge received information that G.P. was apprehended and en route to Lake Charles for re-placement, and G.P. was charged with an offense in East Baton Rouge Parish. The judge received a report on August 1, 2018, that the East Baton Rouge Parish charge had been dismissed, but G.P. was scheduled for court in Calcasieu Parish on August 17, 2018. The judge was informed on August 14, 2018, that G.P. ran away from Harbour House on August 12, 2018, and had been apprehended. The judge noted G.P. had been off his medication from July 5 through August 14, 2018.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   OJJ had made an appointment for G.P. on August 16, 2018, to get reauthorization and to refill his medication. On August 14, 2018, the judge ordered G.P. placed in secure custody. The judge provides the following reasons for her order:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   1. Rebecca Harmon, his probation officer, informed the Court that he had a very important doctor's appointment that he had to be present for in 2 days to be able to get back on his medication;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   2. The juvenile while in court discussed that he did not intend to comply with any facility that he could leave and threatened again to run away;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   3. His mother stated that it takes approximately 30 days for the juvenile to be maintained on his medication for them to be effective and have the necessary overall effect desired.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The probation revocation review, as well as the adjudication hearing in an unrelated lower court docket number, is set for September 25, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   OJJ filed a notice of intent to seek review of and request for a stay of the trial court's order of secure confinement on August 21, 2018. The trial court set a return date of September 13, 2018, and denied the request for stay. OJJ's writ was filed with this court on August 31, 2018. OJJ requests expedited consideration by this court or that a stay be issued. For the following reasons, we deny the stay, grant the request for expedited consideration, and deny OJJ's application for supervisory writs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   OJJ contends the trial court erred in ordering it to place G.P. in a specific type of placement thereby circumventing the agency's exclusive authority to determine the placement of a youth in its custody without regard for the agency's resources or appropriate examinations, tests, or evaluations that must be conducted prior to such a determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   OJJ relies on La.Ch.Code art. 908(A) and La.R.S. 15:901(D) to support its argument that it has sole authority over treatment, placement, and care of youth in its custody. OJJ argues that a court is prohibited from dictating the use of resources allocated to OJJ. Thus, any order that circumvents this authority should be rendered void.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Both La.Ch.Code art. 102, which sets forth the purpose and construction of the Children's Code, and La.Ch.Code art. 801, which addresses the purpose of the delinquency provisions, state that in those instances when a juvenile is removed from the control of his parents, \"the court shall secure for him care as nearly as possible\n   equivalent to that which the parents should have given him.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Louisiana Children's Code Article 897 addresses disposition after adjudication of a felony-grade delinquent act and states, in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   C.

In its ruling, the fifth circuit stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   [T]he legislature set up a system of juvenile correction and rehabilitation in which, both courts exercising juvenile jurisdiction, and the state departments responsible for the custody of these juveniles, serve specific roles. Put succinctly, the role of the juvenile court judge is to oversee the general plan for the correction and rehabilitation of the child, while the role of the state is to provide the details for the implementation of that plan.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   We recognize that the concerns of both the state and the juvenile court, with respect to the efforts to rehabilitate the children of this state who are at risk, are consistent. The problems lies [sic] in different views on how the limited resources available to help these children should be allocated. It is clear that the state has only limited resources to provide needed services to the juveniles in its custody. It is also clear that the legislature set up a system whereby the state, not the juvenile court, should be the ultimate authority on how these resources should be allocated. However, the juvenile court retains jurisdiction to review the disposition and the power to change that disposition when warranted. It also retains jurisdiction to review grievances pursuant to C.Ch. art. 912. Further, under the provisions of R.S. 15:901 E, the juvenile court can make recommendations to the state. Under section F of that statute the court can insist that the state formulate an individualized plan for the child, and meet certain minimum requirements consistent with R.S. 15:901.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   However, the court cannot arbitrarily make the specific decisions on services needed by the child as it did in the instant matter. In the matter before this Court, the juvenile court rendered a disposition judgment committing the juvenile to the custody of the state. In a modification of that disposition, the court assessed and set specific educational goals for the child, and ordered the state to provide the necessary services to achieve the goal. We find this to be a violation of the court's authority. Accordingly, the judgment of the juvenile court ordering the state to provide additional educational time every evening for V.N. is vacated.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11835699\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/712/954/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11835699\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/712/954/\">\n    at 959\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State in Interest of C.M.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=14-88%20%28La.App.%204%20Cir.%205/28/14%29\">\n    14-88 (La.App. 4 Cir. 5/28/14)\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6944074\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/141/921/\">\n    141 So.3d 921\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    State in Interest of R.F.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=97-1056%20%28La.App.%205%20Cir.%203/16/99%29\">\n    97-1056 (La.App. 5 Cir. 3/16/99)\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11596704\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/733/84/\">\n    733 So.2d 84\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the fifth circuit was called on to address a juvenile court's order for specific treatment and services for a child placed in the custody of DPSC following his adjudication of delinquency.

However, in addressing the ability of the juvenile court to place restrictions on a child's parole eligibility, the first circuit stated, \"once a child has been committed to the custody of the Department, the Department has\n   <strong>\n    sole\n   </strong>\n   authority over the placement, care, treatment, or any other considerations deemed necessary.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Based on\n   <em>\n    R.F.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11596704\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/733/84/\">\n    733 So.2d 84\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    J.C.\n   </em>\n   , 09-2000, we find the district court had authority to recommend secure confinement for G.P.

However, in\n   <em>\n    S.T.\n   </em>\n   , the first circuit did not expressly state when setting aside the disposition that it was doing so because the lower court ordered the juvenile placed in non-secure confinement.

In addressing the issue, the fifth circuit held:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   In the present case, the judge ordered that the juvenile be committed to the custody of the Department of Public Safety and Corrections, in a secure environment, until his twenty-first birthday. However, once he committed the juvenile, he did not dictate the actual placement, other than it being a secure environment of the juvenile, nor did he dictate the care or treatment the child was to receive in the department's custody. We find, from the above cited articles, that the court\n   <em>\n    can recommend placement\n   </em>\n   in a\n   <em>\n    secure setting\n   </em>\n   . See also La. R.S. 15:901.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   We also note that a modification of disposition\n   <em>\n    can\n   </em>\n   be filed at any time, if it becomes apparent that the child no longer needs a secure environment. La. Ch.C. art. 909 through 911. See also La. R.S. 15:906 A(1) which allows the Department of Public Safety and Corrections to recommend to the committing court the release of the juvenile committed to its care, who, in the opinion of the department, is ready to be returned to his own home, or to a substitute home.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   Based on the foregoing discussion, and particularly in light of the fact that a modification of disposition can be filed, we find no error in the trial court's disposition imposing a minimum sentence and further mandating that the juvenile be placed in a secure setting. This assignment of error is without merit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7420243\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/687/136/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7420243\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/687/136/\">\n    at 139\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The fifth circuit cited La.Ch.Code art. 897(D) and La.Ch.Code art. 903(C) in support of its ruling.
