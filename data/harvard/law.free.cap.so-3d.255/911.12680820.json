Edwards of Choice Legal Group, P.A., Fort Lauderdale, for Appellee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   CASANUEVA, Judge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In this appeal from a final judgment of foreclosure, James McCampbell contends that the trial court erred in admitting copies of his loan modification agreement, and Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) concedes that the admission of the copies was improper. Accordingly, we reverse.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On October 26, 2007, Mr. McCampbell signed the original mortgage and promissory note on the property, and on July 14, 2010, an agreement modifying the original loan and all of the original loan documents was executed. At trial, Fannie Mae called one witness to testify and that witness did not produce the original loan modification agreement nor did the witness explain its absence. Rather, Fannie Mae sought the admission of a copy of the agreement. Over objection, the trial court admitted the copy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   During this appeal, Fannie Mae conceded that the admission in evidence of the copy of the loan modification agreement, without an explanation by Fannie Mae as to its failure to produce the original, was error. For purposes of this appeal, we accept Fannie Mae's concession of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   We note that since the oral argument of this matter, the Fourth District Court of Appeal has clarified its prior holding in\n   <em>\n    Rattigan v.
