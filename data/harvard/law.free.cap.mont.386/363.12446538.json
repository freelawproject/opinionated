At sentencing, the District Court allowed the State to admit evidence, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>over Sherman\u2019s objection, of an allegation that Sherman had raped his cellmate while in jail. The court sentenced Sherman to 100 years in prison as a persistent felony offender. Sherman argues that his sentence must be reversed because the court relied on the rape allegation after assuring him that it would not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">\u00b62 We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">\u00b63 In October 2013, Ravalli County Sheriffs officers arrested Sherman at a motel in Hamilton, Montana, after receiving information that he was distributing dangerous drugs. Officers recovered methamphetamine and marijuana upon searching Sherman\u2019s motel room and vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">\u00b64 Sherman entered into an open plea agreement in December 2014 in which he pleaded guilty to three offenses: felony possession of dangerous drugs with intent to distribute; felony possession of dangerous drugs; and misdemeanor possession of dangerous drugs. The plea agreement provided a maximum possible penalty for the three combined counts of200 years and six months in prison, plus a $100,500 fine. It provided also that Sherman would be sentenced as a persistent felony offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-9\">\u00b65 The court held a sentencing hearing in April 2015. The Pre-Sentence Investigation (PSI) report contained a summary of Sherman\u2019s criminal history, which included numerous drug-related convictions. The report added a \u201cJail Adjustment Summary\u201d discussing Sherman\u2019s myriad behavioral incidents while detained at the Ravalli County Detention Center after his October 2013 arrest. The summary included, among other incidents, Sherman\u2019s attempts to \u201ccheek\u201d or \u201cpocket\u201d his medications, his striking another inmate in the face, an allegation that he intimidated other inmates to give him their commissary items and extra phone minutes, and an allegation that he had raped his cellmate in February 2015. The rape allegation was still under investigation at the time of the sentencing hearing and had not resulted in a criminal charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-10\">\u00b66 At the sentencing hearing, the State sought to admit a jail incident report discussing the alleged rape. Sherman\u2019s counsel objected to the report and to the discussion of the alleged rape in the PSI report on the grounds that investigation into the incident was ongoing and that the court\u2019s consideration of the incident would violate Sherman\u2019s due process rights. The District Court overruled the objection, reasoning that evidence of the alleged rape \u201cwould have some limited utility in regard to the Defendant\u2019s behavior in the detention center.\u201d Of the substance of the rape allegation, the court stated, \u201c[I]f there\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>[sic] no convictions or charges even, I won\u2019t be relying on this in making my sentence.\u201d Sherman offered no evidence to rebut the allegation.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">\u00b67 The court sentenced Sherman to 100 years in prison and explained in open court the reasons for the sentence. It observed that Sherman had at least ten prior felony convictions, most of which pertained to possessing, transporting, or distributing controlled substances, in addition to various drug-related misdemeanor offenses. It highlighted Sherman\u2019s 2003 convictions for possession of methamphetamine and using a communication device to facilitate distribution, for which Sherman was sentenced to seven years in prison and four years of probation. It emphasized that Sherman had absconded from probation and was in violation of that probation when he was arrested in October 2013. It noted that, as a primary source of methamphetamine distribution in Ravalli County, Sherman had caused significant \u201csocial damage\u201d to the community. The court stated that it recognized many of the names of persons to whom Sherman had distributed methamphetamine and noted that their methamphetamine use had caused significant damage to them and to their families. In some cases, the court pointed out, the methamphetamine users had lost their parental rights because of their addictions. Due to Sherman\u2019s extensive record of drug-related offenses, the court doubted that Sherman would be amenable to treatment or rehabilitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">\u00b68 The court noted further that Sherman had a \u201clengthy history of problems in the jail ... [m]ore than anybody [the court had] ever sentenced before.\u201d The court did not specifically mention the allegation that Sherman had raped his cellmate. It concluded that the primary goal of the sentence should be to remove Sherman permanently from the drug trade. Sherman appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">\u00b69 Whether a district court violated a defendant\u2019s constitutional rights at sentencing is a question of law that we review de novo. <em>State v. Simmons, </em>2011 MT 264, \u00b6 9, 362 Mont. 306, 264 P.3d 706.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b389-10\">\u00b610 <em>Whether the District Court violated Sherman\u2019s due process rights at sentencing.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b389-11\">\u00b611 Sherman contends that the District Court violated his due process rights by falsely assuring him that it would not rely on the allegation of rape in making its sentencing decision. He asserts that he relied on this assurance in choosing not to offer any evidence to rebut the rape allegation. He argues that the court impermissibly considered the rape <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>allegation in imposing sentence, thereby misleading Sherman and effectively denying him the opportunity to explain or rebut the allegation.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">\u00b612 The Montana and United States constitutions guarantee against depriving a person of liberty without due process of law, and these protections apply in sentencing hearings. U.S. Const, amend. XIV, \u00a7 1; Mont. Const. art. II, \u00a7 17; <em>State v. Webb, </em>2005 MT 5, \u00b6 18, 325 Mont. 317, 106 P.3d 521. \u201cDue process requires that an offender be given an opportunity to explain, argue, and rebut any information, including pre-sentencing information!,] that may lead to a deprivation of life, liberty, or property.\u201d <em>State v. Mainwaring, </em>2007 MT 14, \u00b6 16, 335 Mont. 322, 151 P.3d 53 (citing <em>Bauer v. State, </em>1999 MT 185, \u00b6 22, 295 Mont. 306, 983 P.2d 955).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">\u00b613 A defendant\u2019s due process rights include protection against a sentence \u201cpredicated on misinformation.\u201d <em>Simmons, </em>\u00b6 11; <em>accord State v. Mason, </em>2003 MT 371, \u00b6 21, 319 Mont. 117, 82 P.3d 903. \u201c[WJhere a sentencing court is found not to have relied on improper or erroneous information in sentencing a criminal defendant,\u201d however, \u201cthe defendant is not entitled to resentencing on due process grounds.\u201d <em>State v. Phillips, </em>2007 MT 117, \u00b6 17, 337 Mont. 248, 159 P.3d 1078 (quoting <em>Mason, </em>\u00b6 21; <em>Bauer, </em>\u00b6 24). The defendant has an \u201caffirmative duty\u201d to show that the sentence was premised upon \u201cmaterially inaccurate or prejudicial\u201d information. <em>Bauer, </em>\u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">\u00b614 Sherman argues that he was denied \u201can opportunity to explain, argue, and rebut\u201d the rape allegation. <em>Mainwaring, </em>\u00b6 16. But the court overruled Sherman\u2019s objection to the State\u2019s evidence of the allegation and told Sherman that the evidence \u201cwould have some limited utility in regard to [Sherman\u2019s] behavior in the detention center.\u201d Sherman knew of the allegation when he received the PSI report before sentencing and was advised of the court\u2019s ruling on the incident report. The court did not preclude Sherman from rebutting this evidence; instead, Sherman decided that such a rebuttal was not necessary in light of the court\u2019s comments.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">\u00b615 Sherman\u2019s due process argument rests on the premise that the court relied on the unproved rape allegation in making its sentencing decision. In <em>Simmons, </em>we held that the sentencing court did not violate the defendant\u2019s due process rights when it limited Simmons\u2019s cross-examination of a jail detention officer who testified to Simmons\u2019s behavioral issues at the detention center. <em>Simmons, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 6, 12. The court stated that it would not \u201cgrade\u201d Simmons on her behavioral issues in making its sentencing decision. <em>Simmons, </em>\u00b6 6. When the court sentenced Simmons, it gave numerous reasons for its decision, including a reference to her \u201cnegative behavior in the detention <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>center.\u201d <em>Simmons, </em>\u00b6 7. We concluded that, apart from Simmons\u2019s behavior in the detention center, \u201cthe District Court considered numerous pieces of evidence pertaining to Simmons\u2019s potential for rehabilitation and the severity of the crimes she committed.\u201d <em>Simmons, </em>\u00b6 12. We held that Simmons had not \u201cmet her burden on appeal of showing the sentencing court relied on materially false allegations in forming the sentence.\u201d <em>Simmons, </em>\u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"aqy-dedup-1\">\u00b616  Here, as in <em>Simmons, </em>the record does not support a finding that the District Court relied on the rape allegation in making its sentencing decision. The court\u2019s detailed explanation of its decision focused on Sherman\u2019s lengthy criminal history, the \u201csocial damage\u201d his criminal actions had caused, the improbability of his rehabilitation, and the need to remove him from the drug trade. It emphasized that Sherman was \u201ca methamphetamine distributor to other distributors\u201d and that a treatment program would not be successful. The court told Sherman, \u201cyou\u2019ve been in prison before; you\u2019ve not changed your behavior as a result of that experience.\u201d Due to the court\u2019s conclusion that Sherman would not be \u201camenable to treatment or rehabilitative efforts,\u201d the court told Sherman, \u201cit seems to me that my primary duty here today is to incapacitate you so that you will be permanently removed from the drug trade and never have the opportunity to destroy any other lives with this activity.\u201d The court gave mention to Sherman\u2019s \u201clengthy history of problems in the jail.\u201d But it did not identify the alleged rape as having any influence on the decision, and its extensive explanation clearly reveals the real rationale for the court\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">\u00b617 The record shows that the court rested its sentencing decision on Sherman\u2019s continuous and substantial involvement in the drug trade. It \u201cconsidered numerous pieces of evidence\u201d regarding his history of drug dealing and the devastating community impact of his actions. <em>Simmons, </em>\u00b6 12. That evidence\u2014not the jailhouse rape allegation\u2014formed the basis for the sentence. Sherman has failed to meet his burden on appeal of showing that the court premised its sentencing decision on \u201cmaterially inaccurate or prejudicial\u201d information. <em>Bauer, </em>\u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b391-9\">\u00b618 We conclude that Sherman \u201cis not entitled to resentencing on due process grounds.\u201d <em>Phillips, </em>\u00b6 17. The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b391-10\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES WHEAT, SANDEFUR and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
