The Twelfth Judicial District Court granted Anderson and Springer summary judgment after concluding that the statute of repose time-barred the School District\u2019s claims. We address the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-11\">\n<em>1. Whether the District Court correctly held that the statute of repose barred the School District\u2019s claims;</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-12\">\n<em>2. Whether the District Court correctly held that the period of repose could not be tolled;</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-13\">\n<em>3. Whether the District Court correctly awarded Springer attorney fees under the contract.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-14\">\u00b62 We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-15\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b248-16\">\u00b63 The School District entered into a contract with Springer in 1996 to design a new roof for Havre High School. The School District then entered into a contract with Anderson in 1997 to construct the roof. Anderson began construction in June 1997. The expected completion date for the project was October 1997. It is undisputed that the project was not completed by that point, but the parties dispute whether the project ever was \u201ccompleted.\u201d Nevertheless, a final walkthrough occurred in January 1998 in which the parties discussed various punch list items that needed to be addressed. The school was in full use by April 1998 and the School District issued final payment around that same time.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>\u00b64 Problems emerged with the new roof almost immediately. For example, the roof leaked, shingles and ridge caps fell off, interior vertical and horizontal beams were twisted, several vertical beams were not properly attached to the flooring, and a portion of the roof began to pull away from a wall. Springer and Anderson worked with the School District to address the various problems beginning in 1998. In October 2003, Springer informed the School District that repairs were finished and that no further work was necessary. After a heavy snowstorm in December 2010, 6,000 square feet of the roof collapsed.</p>\n<p id=\"AoBu\">\u00b65 The School District filed suit in December 2011. Its amended complaint alleged negligence, breach of express and implied warranty, breach of contract, negligent misrepresentation, deceit, and fraud. Springer and Anderson filed motions to dismiss\u2014which the District Court converted to motions for summary judgment\u2014asserting that the action was barred by the passage of time. The court granted Springer and Anderson summary judgment. It concluded that \u00a7 27-2-208, MCA, barred the School District\u2019s claims because the roof was \u201ccompleted,\u201d within the meaning of the statute, in 1998. The court concluded also that alleged fraudulent concealment would not toll the statute of repose under \u00a7 27-2-208, MCA. Finally, the court awarded Springer attorney fees pursuant to the contract between Springer and the School District. The School District claims error in each ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">\u00b66 We review summary judgment rulings de novo, applying the standards set forth in M. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(3). <em>Bird v. Cascade Cnty., </em>2016 MT 345, \u00b6 9, 386 Mont. 69, 386 P.3d 602. Summary judgment is appropriate when the moving party demonstrates both the absence of any genuine issues of material fact and entitlement to judgment as a matter of law. M. R. Civ. P. <em>56(c)(3); Bird, </em>\u00b6 9. Once the moving party has met its burden, the opposing party must present material and substantial evidence to raise a genuine issue of material fact. <em>Bird, </em>\u00b6 9. We will draw all reasonable inferences from the offered evidence in favor of the party opposing summary judgment; but conclusory statements, speculative assertions, and mere denials are insufficient to defeat a motion for summary judgment. <em>Bird, </em>\u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">\u00b67 We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether they are correct. <em>Bird, </em>\u00b6 9. A decision on a request for an award of attorney fees is reviewed for an abuse of discretion unless a contract requires an award of fees, in which case a district court lacks discretion to deny the request. <em>Wittich Law Firm, P.C. v. O\u2019Connell, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>2013 MT 122, \u00b6 15, 370 Mont. 103, 304 P.3d 375.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">\u00b68 <em>1. Whether the District Court correctly held that the statute of repose barred the School District\u2019s claims.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">\u00b69 The District Court concluded that the roof was completed in 1998 and thus the School District\u2019s claims were barred under the ten-year statute of repose found at \u00a7 27-2-208, MCA. The court first determined that the statute\u2019s definition of \u201ccompletion\u201d \u201cindicates [that] perfect performance is not required but instead that the construction of real property be usable for the purpose for which it is intended.\u201d The court concluded that the \u201cpurpose of the roofing project in this case is to shelter the building\u2019s occupants and its contents from the elements.\u201d Acknowledging that \u201cSpringer and Anderson may have performed their obligation poorly,\u201d the court found undisputed evidence that the School District began using the roof for its intended purpose in April of 1998. As such, the District Court concluded that \u00a7 27-2-208, MCA, barred the School District\u2019s claims and granted Springer and Anderson summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-9\">\u00b610 On appeal, the School District argues that questions of fact exist regarding when, or even if, the roof was completed; the District Court therefore erred in granting Springer and Anderson summary judgment. The School District asserts that it submitted substantial evidence that the project was never completed because the roof had significant defects that were never resolved by Springer and Anderson. And, the School District contends, the roof did not meet its intended purpose because it did not shelter the building from the elements. The School District emphasizes that Springer and Anderson never issued a certificate of completion. Finally, the School District claims that because Springer and Anderson continued to work on the roof until 2003, it cannot be said that the collapse of the roof arose out of their work on the project in 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-10\">\u00b611 In construing a statute, we look first \u201cto the plain meaning\u201d of its language. <em>Eldorado Coop Canal Co. v. Hoge, </em>2016 MT 145, \u00b6 18, 383 Mont. 523, 373 P.3d 836 (citation and internal quotations omitted). We also interpret a statute \u201cas part of a whole statutory scheme and construe it so as to forward the purpose of that scheme.\u201d <em>Eldorado Coop Canal Co., </em>\u00b6 18 (citation and internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-11\">\u00b612 Statutes of repose create \u201ca substantive right in those protected to be free from liability after a legislatively-determined period of time.\u201d <em>Joyce v. Garnaas, </em>1999 MT 170, \u00b6 14, 295 Mont. 198, 983 P.2d 369 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>(citation omitted). Such statutes \u201care based on considerations of the economic best interests of the public as a whole and are substantive grants of immunity based on a legislative balance of the respective rights of potential plaintiffs and defendants struck by determining a time limit beyond which liability no longer exists.\u201d <em>Joyce, </em>\u00b6 14 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">\u00b613 The statute of repose applicable to improvements to real property provides, in pertinent part, that \u201can action to recover damages ... resulting from or arising out of the design ... [or] construction ... of any improvement to real property ... may not be commenced more than 10 years after completion of the improvement.\u201d Section 27-2-208(1), MCA. The statute expressly defines \u201ccompletion\u201d as \u201cthat degree of completion at which the owner can utilize the improvement for the purpose for which it was intended or when a completion certificate is executed, whichever is earlier.\u201d Section 27-2-208(4)(a), MCA. Section 27-2-208, MCA, thus poses \u201can absolute bar to bringing a claim for construction-related damages more than ten years after construction is completed.\u201d <em>Hein v. Sott, </em>2015 MT 196, \u00b6 11, 380 Mont. 85, 353 P.3d 494; <em>accord Ass\u2019n of Unit Owners of Deer Lodge Condominium v. Big Sky, </em>245 Mont. 64, 80, 798 P.2d 1018, 1028 (1990) (citing \u00a7 27-2-208, MCA, to conclude that \u201cin no event shall any cause be commenced more than ten years after the completion of the improvement\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">\u00b614 It is undisputed that neither Anderson nor Springer ever executed a completion certificate for the project. In determining whether the roof was completed pursuant to the statute, the District Court hence focused its inquiry on whether the School District could utilize the roof for its intended purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">\u00b615 The School District\u2019s argument that the roof was not complete pursuant to \u00a7 27-2-208(4)(a), MCA, because the roof needed repairs conflicts with the statute\u2019s plain language. Section 27-2-208(4)(a) requires a <em>\u201cdegree </em>of completion at which the owner can utilize the improvement for the purpose for which it was intended.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The statute does not require that an improvement be finished to the owner\u2019s final satisfaction. It requires instead that the improvement can be used for its intended purpose. As the District Court noted, \u201cthe School District\u2019s interpretation of the statute would require any unsatisfactorily completed construction project to extend the statute of repose <em>ad infinitum </em>based upon any subsequent repair work done by the original contractor or engineer.\u201d Such an interpretation runs counter to both the statute\u2019s plain language and the purpose of the statute of repose.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>\u00b616 Although the School District relies heavily on the ongoing issues with the roof, it has failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether the roof could be utilized for the purpose for which it was intended in April 1998. As Richard Floren\u2014the School District\u2019s representative overseeing the project\u2014testified during his deposition, the High School was in full use by that time. The evidence demonstrates that the roof had been installed and the School District was putting the roof to use for its intended purpose in April 1998, and the roof was therefore completed as defined by the statute. Facts showing the School District\u2019s dissatisfaction with the roof s condition and that the roof continued to leak do not present substantial evidence that the roof was incomplete within the meaning of \u00a7 27-2-208(4)(a), MCA. <em>See Hein, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 4, 11 (concluding that \u00a7 27-2-208, MCA, barred claims related to the construction of a home even though ongoing repairs were made to the home following its completion, and even though the roof leaked due to improper ventilation). Rather, as the District Court stressed, the need for ongoing repairs to the roof would show at most that Springer and Anderson completed their jobs inadequately. Finally, the School District recognized that the roof was completed in the late 1990s. In a 2003 letter to Springer, Floren expressed thanks to Anderson \u201cfor finding solutions to a project they <em>completed </em>several years ago.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"a7e-dedup-0\">\u00b617  The District Court was correct when it held that Springer and Anderson completed the roof pursuant to \u00a7 27-2-208, MCA, in April 1998. Accordingly, the District Court correctly concluded that the School District\u2019s claims were barred by the statute of repose.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">\u00b618 <em>2. Whether the District Court correctly held that the period of repose could not be tolled.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">\u00b619 In concluding that alleged fraudulent concealment or late discovery of facts would not toll the statute of repose, the District Court emphasized that the School District had not alleged \u201cthat the fraudulent or deceitful conduct created some separate injury as opposed to the injury allegedly caused by the roofing project.\u201d Accordingly, the court concluded, the School District\u2019s allegation that Springer and Anderson deceitfully concealed problems with the roof \u201cdoes not circumvent the statute of repose and consequently all of the claims are barred because they still relate to [the] roofing project that was completed in 1998.\u201d Relying on <em>Hein, Big Sky, </em>and <em>Snyder v. Love, </em>2006 MT 317, 335 Mont. 49, 153 P.3d 571, the court concluded that \u00a7 27-2-208, MCA, may \u201cnot be extended even if a party is late in discovering facts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b253-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>\u00b620 The School District argues that the District Court erred in concluding that \u00a7 27-2-208, MCA, could not be tolled. The School District first contends that the court\u2019s reliance on <em>Hein, Big Sky, </em>and <em>Snyder </em>was misplaced because those cases are distinguishable. The School District next asserts that \u00a7 27-2-102, MCA, sets forth rules for determining when an action must be commenced. That statute, the School District contends, applies to \u00a7 27-2-208, MCA, and makes clear that the limitation period does not begin on any claim until the facts constituting the claim are discovered. The School District alleges that Springer and Anderson concealed relevant information regarding its claims because the School District was unaware that certain structural features were not installed on the roof. Thus, the School District claims that the statute of repose should have been tolled.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\">\u00b621 We are unpersuaded by the School District\u2019s arguments. In <em>Big Sky, </em>we held unequivocally that \u201c\u00a7 27-2-208, MCA, provides ... that... <em>in no event </em>shall any cause be commenced more than ten years after the completion of the improvement.\u201d <em>Big Sky, </em>245 Mont. at 80, 798 P.2d at 1028 (emphasis added). We reiterated in <em>Hein </em>that the \u201cstatute of repose is <em>an absolute bar </em>to bringing a claim for construction-related damages more than ten years after construction is completed.\u201d <em>Hein, </em>\u00b6 11 (citing <em>Big Sky, </em>245 Mont. at 80, 798 P.2d at 1028) (emphasis added). Significantly, we concluded in <em>Hein </em>that the period of repose under \u00a7 27-2-208, MCA, \u201cwill not be extended <em>even if a </em>party is late in discovering facts.\u201d Hein, \u00b6 11 (citing <em>Big Sky, </em>245 Mont. at 80, 798 P.2d at 1028; <em>Snyder, </em>\u00b6 15) (emphasis added). Our explicit holdings regarding \u00a7 27-2-208, MCA, in <em>Big Sky </em>and <em>Hein </em>are directly on point.</p>\n<p id=\"afo-dedup-0\">\u00b622 Our reasoning in <em>Snyder </em>also is persuasive, even though it dealt with the statute of repose for legal malpractice actions under \u00a7 27-2-206, MCA. In <em>Snyder, </em>we reaffirmed that a \u201cstatute of repose is typically an absolute time limit beyond which liability no longer exists and is not tolled <em>for any reason </em>because to do so would upset the economic balance struck by the legislative body.\u201d <em>Snyder, </em>\u00b6 16 (citation and internal quotations omitted) (emphasis added); <em>accord Blackburn v. Blue Mt. Women\u2019s Clinic, </em>286 Mont. 60, 73, 951 P.2d 1, 9 (1997) (\u201cIn the absence of specific statutory language to the contrary, a statute of repose such as the one codified in \u00a7 27-2-205(1), MCA, is not subject to tolling.\u201d). Similar to <em>Hein, </em>we concluded that \u00a7 27-2-206, MCA, was an \u201cabsolute time limit beyond which liability no longer exists.\u201d <em>Snyder, </em>\u00b6 15 (citation and internal quotations omitted). As such, we confirmed that \u201c[n]ot even fraudulent concealment can toll the statute of repose.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number><em>Snyder, </em>\u00b6 15 (citation and internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"Aspa\">\u00b623  Section 27-2-208, MCA, serves as \u201can absolute bar\u201d to the School District\u2019s claims because, as the District Court correctly held, the School District filed the claims more than ten years after construction was completed. <em>Hein, </em>\u00b6 11; <em>accord Big Sky, </em>245 Mont. at 80, 798 P.2d at 1028. The statute bars the School District\u2019s claims even if it did not discover, or Anderson and Springer concealed, relevant facts. <em>Hein, </em>\u00b6 11; <em>Snyder, </em>\u00b6 15. The District Court correctly concluded that the period of repose could not be tolled.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">\u00b624 <em>3. Whether the District Court correctly awarded Springer attorney fees under the contract.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">\u00b625 The contract between Springer and the School District provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-8\">Should litigation or arbitration occur between the two parties relating to the provisions of this Agreement, all reasonable litigation or arbitration expenses, collection expenses, witness fees, court costs and attorneys [sic] fees incurred by the prevailing party shall be paid by the non-prevailing party to the prevailing party.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b254-9\">In concluding that Springer was entitled to fees for defending the instant action, the District Court noted that the attorney fees clause \u201ccovers any litigation \u2018relating to the provisions\u2019 of the agreement.\u201d The court determined that the provisions of the contract related to \u201cSpringer\u2019s work reroofing Havre High School.\u201d The court held that all of the School District\u2019s claims \u201crelate in some fashion to Springer\u2019s work on the roof of the high school and this work is expressly covered by the contract.\u201d Because the court\u2019s order regarding the statute of repose barred all the School District\u2019s claims, the court concluded that its \u201cgrant of summary judgment was sufficiently related to the provisions of the contract.\u201d Thus, the District Court awarded Springer its attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-10\">\u00b626 The School District asserts first that Springer is not entitled to attorney fees because the litigated claims arose after the term of the contract. The School District next claims that the litigation does not relate to the contract because it did not rely on any provisions in the contract in its claims against Springer, Springer did not defend based on any contract provisions, and the District Court\u2019s order granting summary judgment did not analyze any contract provision. Thus, the School District contends that the contract does not cover any of the claims litigated, and attorney fees therefore may not be awarded under the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>\u00b627 A court must award attorney fees if a contract provides for their recovery. <em>Wittich Law Firm, P.C., </em>\u00b6 15. The interpretation of a contract is a question of law that we review for correctness. <em>Hurly v. Lake Cabin Dev., LLC, </em>2012 MT 77, \u00b6 14, 364 Mont. 425, 276 P.3d 854.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\">\u00b628  The contract provides that attorney fees \u201cshall be paid by the non-prevailing party\u201d in litigation relating \u201cto the provisions\u201d of the contract. The litigation clearly relates to the provisions of the contract. First, the School District\u2019s amended complaint included a claim for breach of contract. In addition, the contract is the basis for Springer designing the roof. Springer\u2019s alleged failure to do what it promised in the contract is the basis for the School District\u2019s lawsuit. The contract obligated the School District, as the non-prevailing party, to pay Springer its attorney fees. Thus, the District Court did not have discretion to deny Springer its attorney fees and properly awarded them.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">\u00b629 We affirm the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to Springer and Anderson and its award of attorney fees to Springer.</p>\n<judges id=\"b255-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES McKINNON, SHEA and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b255-8\">JUSTICE WHEAT,</author>\n<p id=\"AqL\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-9\">\u00b630 I dissent from the Court\u2019s decision to affirm the grants of summary judgment to Anderson and Springer because I believe the School District\u2019s evidence regarding when its cause of action accrued presented a genuine issue of material fact which precluded summary judgment. I would reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-10\">\u00b631 The District Court expressly found that from 1997, when the school roof project was initiated \u201cto stop the immediate leaking\u201d of the existing roof, through 2003, the School District repeatedly reported problems with the new roof to Anderson and Springer, including that the roof leaked, lost shingles and flashing, and at one point a portion of the roof had separated from the wall. The court also noted that the School District advised the contractor and architect that the roof system had crooked and inadequate horizontal and vertical support beams and that some beams were detached from the floor. Anderson and Springer responded by performing certain repairs, but rejected other complaints, assuring the School District that the beams were sufficient to support the roof and needed no further repair. A certificate of completion was never issued by Springer or Anderson. The School District continued to endure problems with the roof until its 2010 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>collapse.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">\u00b632 As discussed in the majority Opinion, in reaching its decision, the District Court relied on the statutory definition of \u201ccompletion\u201d which means \u201cthat degree of completion at which the owner can utilize the improvement for the purpose for which it was intended or when a completion certificate is executed, whichever is earlier.\u201d Section 27-2-208(4)(a), MCA. The court explained: \u201c[T]he purpose of the roofing project in this case is to shelter the building\u2019s occupants and its contents from the elements.\u201d The District Court concluded that the project satisfied this intended purpose in 1998 thereby rendering the School District\u2019s 2011 complaint untimely under the \u201c10 years after completion\u201d statute of repose. Section 27-2-208(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">\u00b633 The record reveals that the School District notified Springer in a 1998 letter that the roof was leaking \u201cas badly as it always did\u201d and it was \u201craining under the vestibule.\u201d Again, in 1999, the School District alerted Springer that the vestibule roof continued to heavily leak during any rain. The School District presented evidence that to control the leaking water from the ineffective roof construction and protect the building and its contents from further damage, the School District had specially-made gutters installed to direct the rain water to a sump pump-controlled barrel. Furthermore, the school placed multiple trash cans and buckets throughout the school to catch the rain leaking from the roof but nonetheless experienced water damage to the building and its contents. I proffer that a jury could conclude that (1) a leaking vestibule was unusable for its intended purpose, i.e., to shelter people from rain and other elements, and (2) a building owner that must place containers throughout a building to capture leaking rain water but still experiences damages is not utilizing a roof \u201cfor the purpose for which it is intended.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">\u00b634 The School District also presented evidence that the contractor and architect were advised by the project engineer that additional strap bracing was required to support the new roof (which was built above the original roof) but neither Anderson nor Springer installed the required bracing which, as argued by the School District, caused the roof to collapse. Notably, the School District did not learn that strap bracing was required but not installed until the post-roof collapse investigation in 2010. Under these facts, a jury could find that failure to perform a critical step in the construction of a new roof renders the project incomplete.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-8\">\u00b635 Based upon the evidence presented, a jury reasonably could conclude that the statute of limitations did not begin to run until <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>discovery of the absent strap bracing in 2010 or that the statute of repose began to run in 2003 when the School District ceased its efforts to have Anderson and Springer continue with their ineffectual work on the roof. As such, the School District\u2019s action may not be time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"Axfax\">\u00b636 Summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. M. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(3). Here, there is a genuine question as to when the School District\u2019s cause of action accrued. When there is conflicting evidence as to when a cause of action accrued, the question of whether an action is barred by the statute of limitations is for the jury to decide. <em>Nelson v. Nelson, </em>2002 MT 151, \u00b6 24, 310 Mont. 329, 50 P.3d 139; <em>N. Cheyenne Tribe v. Roman Catholic Church, </em>2013 MT 24, \u00b6 46, 368 Mont. 330, 296 P.3d 450. This principle applies to questions of material fact vis-a-vis the statute of repose, as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\">\u00b637 Additionally, it is well-established that in resolving a motion for summary judgment, the evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, and all reasonable inferences are to be drawn in favor of the party opposing summary judgment. <em>Harrington v. Crystal Bar, Inc., </em>2013 MT 209, \u00b6 9, 371 Mont. 165, 306 P.3d 342. In the case before us, I believe the court failed to view the evidence as to when the School District\u2019s cause of action accrued in the light most favorable to the School District.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">\u00b638 Lastly, we have repeatedly held that \u201cSummary judgment is an extreme remedy that should never be a substitute for a trial on the merits if a controversy exists over a material fact.\u201d <em>Harrington, </em>\u00b6 10; <em>N. Cheyenne Tribe, </em>\u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">\u00b639 For these reasons, I would reverse the District Court and remand for a trial to determine when the School District\u2019s cause of action accrued and whether the statutes of limitation and repose bar its claim. I respectfully dissent from the Court\u2019s failure to do so.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
