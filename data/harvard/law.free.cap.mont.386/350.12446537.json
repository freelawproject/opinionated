The Plaintiffs sued to restrain Thomas Cherewick and Ronald Henry from actions that Plaintiffs alleged were unauthorized or exceeded their authority as directors and officers of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>the development\u2019s property owners\u2019 association.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Henry and his company, Western Investments, Inc., counterclaimed, alleging that Landowners had conspired to interfere with his business. The District Court granted summary judgment against all parties on their respective claims. It entered a final judgment, declining to award attorney fees and costs to Henry and Cherewick. There are two issues on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-5\">\n<em>1. Whether the District Court erred in granting Landowners summary judgment on Henry\u2019s and Western Investments\u2019 counterclaims for conspiracy and other alleged tortious conduct;</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-6\">\n<em>2. Whether the District Court abused its discretion in denying Henry\u2019s and Cherewick\u2019s motion for attorney fees after they prevailed on the Plaintiffs claims against them.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">\u00b62 We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b376-9\">\u00b63 This case has a contentious history, consuming nearly five years in litigation, with almost 600 documents in the District Court record, five separate summary judgment orders, and eleven briefs from various arrangements of parties covering two distinct claims on appeal. The District Court described it as \u201ca muddled and chaotic case ... [in which] neither Plaintiffs nor Defendants substantially prevailed on any of the asserted claims and counterclaims.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b376-10\">\u00b64 Henry, Cherewick, and Landowners all owned property in Remington Ranch\u2014a real estate development comprising several subdivisions outside of Red Lodge, Montana. Henry developed much of Remington Ranch through his company Western Investments. Western Investments owned numerous lots in Remington Ranch. Western Investments purchased Dr. Herschel and Mary Beth Harters\u2019 interest in a tract of land in one of the subdivisions. In exchange, Western Investments gave the Harters a promissory note for $750,000. After Western Investments failed to make any payments on the note, the Harters filed a UCC-1 Financing Statement and vendor\u2019s lien on certain lots that Western Investments was trying to sell.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-11\">\u00b65 The Remington Ranch Association (Association) is an \u201cumbrella\u201d property owners\u2019 association. It is responsible for maintenance of the common areas of the subdivisions that make up Remington Ranch. While each individual subdivision within Remington Ranch has its own <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>declaration of covenants, conditions, and restrictions, the Association also has its own declaration of covenants, conditions, and restrictions. Landowners are all members of the Association, and Henry and Cherewick were directors and officers of the Association.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">\u00b66 The breaking point in a longstanding period of discord between the parties came when Henry announced that he was going to try to develop part of the property as a resort. Landowners reacted to Henry\u2019s announcement by organizing and discussing their options for preventing commercial development. Ultimately, Landowners\u2014along with about twenty other Remington Ranch property owners\u2014filed a complaint against Cherewick, Henry, the Association, and Association director Nancy Gammill.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Landowners challenged the Association\u2019s authority over the affairs of Remington Ranch\u2019s component subdivisions. Landowners also claimed that Henry and Cherewick took actions that were either unauthorized or exceeded their authority as directors.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">\u00b67 Henry and Western Investments brought several counterclaims against Landowners, including defamation, tortious interference with business relations and prospective economic opportunity, negligent or intentional infliction of emotional distress, slander of title, abuse of process, and civil conspiracy. The basic premise of the counterclaims was that Landowners colluded to drive Henry into bankruptcy, to stop his planned commercial development of the site, and to ruin his reputation in the community. Henry and Western Investments also sought punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">\u00b68 Over the course of nearly five years, the parties engaged in extensive discovery and litigated their various claims and counterclaims through dozens of motions. In the end, the District Court entered summary judgment orders granting judgment to Henry and Cherewick on Landowners\u2019 claims. The court also granted Landowners summary judgment on Henry\u2019s and Western Investments\u2019 counterclaims because it concluded that Henry and Western Investments failed to produce evidence establishing each of the elements of the counterclaims. Finally, the court denied Henry\u2019s and Cherewick\u2019s motion for attorney fees and costs on Landowners\u2019 claims because it determined that they were not a prevailing party. Henry and Cherewick appeal the court\u2019s refusal to award attorney fees; Henry and Western Investments appeal the dismissal of their counterclaims.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">\u00b69 We review summary judgment rulings de novo, applying the standards set forth in M.

Summary judgment is appropriate when the moving party demonstrates both the absence of any genuine issues of material fact and entitlement to judgment as a matter of law. M. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(3); <em>Bird, </em>\u00b6 9. Once the moving party has met its burden, the opposing party must present material and substantial evidence to raise a genuine issue of material fact. <em>Bird, </em>\u00b6 9. We will draw all reasonable inferences from the offered evidence in favor of the party opposing summary judgment; but conclusory statements, speculative assertions, and mere denials are insufficient to defeat a motion for summary judgment. <em>Bird, </em>\u00b6 9.

Whether the District Court erred in granting Landowners summary judgment on Henry\u2019s and Western Investments\u2019 counterclaims for conspiracy and other alleged tortious conduct.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b378-9\">\u00b612 Henry and Western Investments asserted the following counterclaims against Landowners: abuse of process, defamation, negligent or intentional infliction of emotional distress, conspiracy, slander of title, and tortious interference; they also sought punitive damages. While the court granted Landowners summary judgment on all of the counterclaims, Henry and Western Investments address only a few explicitly on appeal. We briefly address each claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-10\">I. Abuse of process, defamation, and negligent or intentional infliction of emotional distress claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-11\">\u00b613 The District Court first concluded that Henry and Western Investments abandoned their claims of abuse of process and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>defamation because they did not include any argument regarding those claims in their briefing to the court; therefore, the court granted Landowners summary judgment on those claims. With regard to the negligent or intentional infliction of emotional distress claim, the District Court noted that Western Investments, as an entity, could not sustain such a claim. The court noted further that Henry\u2019s arguments contained no discussion of the factual or legal basis for the emotional distress claim against Landowners. After determining that the record did not contain any evidence that Landowners caused Henry any emotional distress, the District Court granted Landowners summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">\u00b614 On appeal, Henry and Western Investments do not contest the District Court\u2019s conclusion that they abandoned their abuse of process and defamation claims. Nor do they offer any arguments regarding the court\u2019s conclusion as to their negligent or intentional infliction of emotional distress claim. It is not our responsibility \u201cto develop legal analysis that might support a party\u2019s position.\u201d <em>State v. Gunderson, </em>2010 MT 166, \u00b6 12, 357 Mont. 142, 237 P.3d 74. Accordingly, we conclude that the District Court correctly granted Landowners summary judgment on Henry\u2019s and Western Investments\u2019 abuse of process, defamation, and negligent or intentional infliction of emotional distress counterclaims.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">II. Conspiracy, slander of title, tortious interference, and punitive damages claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">\u00b615 Henry\u2019s and Western Investments\u2019 conspiracy claim alleged that the Harters conspired with the other Remington Ranch property owners to stop Henry\u2019s planned development, force him into bankruptcy, and ruin his business relationships in the community. In addressing the civil conspiracy claim, the court recognized that Henry\u2019s and Western Investments\u2019 \u201cvarious theories of liability are generally centered on only a few overt actions taken by the Harters. They allege that the Harters\u2019 overt acts\u2014and any liability tied to these acts\u2014should be imputed to all other remaining counterclaim defendants.\u201d In an effort to simplify the analysis of the remaining claims, the court chose to \u201cfirst discuss whether the record contains any evidence of a conspiracy between the remaining counterclaim defendants that would allow the Court to impute the actions of the counterclaim defendants to one another.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b379-9\">\u00b616 The court noted Henry\u2019s and Western Investments\u2019 claim that the evidence supported a finding that there was a conspiracy between Landowners to stop the resort\u2019s construction at Remington Ranch. The court determined that such an assertion alone, however, \u201cdoes not assert a claim for civil conspiracy even if true\u201d because there is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>\u201cnothing inherently unlawful about protesting a resort planned to be built in a complainant\u2019s backyard.\u201d Instead, the court concluded, in order to prevail on their claim of civil conspiracy, Henry and Western Investments would have to prove that Landowners \u201chad a \u2018meeting of the minds\u2019 to use unlawful means in pursuit of their otherwise lawful goal of stopping the development of the resort.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">\u00b617 The court recognized Henry\u2019s and Western Investments\u2019 assertion that the \u201cunlawful means\u201d Landowners used to stop the resort were the Harters\u2019 filings. The court acknowledged that the evidence demonstrated Landowners\u2019 opposition to the resort\u2019s construction; it determined, however, that the evidence did \u201cnot support an inference that [Landowners] agreed to use unlawful means to stop the development of the Remington Resort or that the other counterclaim defendants even knew about the Harters\u2019 filings.\u201d Thus, the court held that Henry\u2019s and Western Investments\u2019 claim of conspiracy was nothing more than \u201cmere speculation, insufficient to survive summary judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">\u00b618 The court\u2019s determination regarding the conspiracy claim framed its analysis of the remaining claims. Henry\u2019s and Western Investments\u2019 additional claims centered on the Harters\u2019 filings. Because the court concluded that there was no conspiracy between Landowners, the court determined that the Harters\u2019 conduct was not attributable to Hunt or Sullivan. Based in large part on that determination, the court concluded that Henry and Western Investments had failed to make a prima facie case for the remaining claims against Hunt and Sullivan and therefore granted them summary judgment. Because the Harters filed the liens, the District Court analyzed in more depth the remaining claims against them.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">\u00b619 In addressing Henry\u2019s and Western Investments\u2019 claim that the Harters\u2019 filings constituted slander of title, the court first noted that the relevant tracts of land were owned solely by Western Investments. Thus, the court concluded that Henry did not have a claim for slander of title. The court focused its analysis of Western Investments\u2019 claim on two elements\u2014whether the Harters acted with malice and whether the Harters\u2019 actions caused Western Investments any special damages. The court determined that there were unresolved fact issues regarding whether the Harters acted with malice, but it concluded that Western Investments\u2019 slander of title claim must fail \u201cfor lack of provable damages.\u201d The court noted that there was no evidence demonstrating that the Harters\u2019 filings prevented any sale of lots by Western Investments. Because Western Investments had not presented a prima facie slander of title claim, the court granted the Harters summary judgment on the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>\u00b620 Similarly, the District Court determined that Henry and Western Investments had failed to present a prima facie claim of tortious interference. Henry\u2019s and Western Investments\u2019 tortious interference claim alleged that the Harters interfered with their efforts to develop the resort. The court opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-5\">Given that Henry did not own ... the land upon which the Resort was to be locatedf ], that the owner of [the land] had not taken any steps nor shown any affirmative interest in developing [the land] into the Remington Resort, and that Henry had no financing in place to develop the Resort, [Henry\u2019s and Western Investments\u2019] assertion that it was the Harters who caused the Resort\u2019s failure lacks evidentiary foundation and is speculative.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">Thus, the court granted the Harters summary judgment on the tortious interference claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">\u00b621 Lastly, the court held that Henry\u2019s and Western Investments\u2019 claim for punitive damages must fail \u201c[g]iven a lack of any underlying liability against the Harters.\u201d Before finishing its order, the court noted that the parties \u201chave a great deal of animosity toward one another.\u201d The court reiterated that in order for the alleged claims \u201cto proceed to trial, it was incumbent on Henry and Western Investments to provide the Court with at least some admissible evidence as to each of the elements of their counterclaims. But after more than four years of litigation, this evidence either does not exist or has not been produced.\u201d Accordingly, the District Court granted Landowners summary judgment in all respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">\u00b622 Henry and Western Investments argue generally that the District Court\u2019s conclusions on their counterclaims simply adopt Landowners\u2019 position instead of considering all of the conflicting evidence submitted by Henry and Western Investments. They assert that they presented substantial evidence that the Harters\u2019 purpose in making the filings was to interfere with Henry\u2019s business by stopping the sale of the lots. They stress that a jury also could reasonably infer malice from the Harters\u2019 filing the liens because they allege that the Harters had knowledge that the liens would interfere with pending sales of the encumbered lots. And selling those lots was Henry\u2019s only means of generating income to meet his financial obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-9\">\u00b623 Henry and Western Investments assert further that the court erred by concluding that the other claims were tied to their theory of conspiracy. They claim that they asserted \u201cmultiple stand-alone counts.\u201d As to their civil conspiracy claim, Henry and Western Investments contend that the object of the conspiracy was to tortiously interfere with Henry\u2019s business and that the unlawful objective was the slander of title. Henry and Western Investments contend that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>District Court erred because it is the function of the jury to determine whether there was a meeting of the minds, whether Landowners engaged in an unlawful overt act, and whether damages resulted because of Landowners\u2019 conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"AhM\">\u00b624  A valid civil conspiracy claim requires that each of the following elements be established: \u201c(1) two or more persons ...; (2) an object to be accomplished; (3) a meeting of the minds on the object or course of action; (4) one or more unlawful overt acts; and (5) damages as the proximate result thereof.\u201d <em>Schumacker v. Meridian Oil </em>Co., 1998 MT 79, \u00b6 18, 288 Mont. 217, 956 P.2d 1370 (citing <em>Simmons Oil Corp. v. Holly Corp., </em>258 Mont. 79, 91, 852 P.2d 523, 530 (1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"amc-dedup-1\">\u00b625  Here, the first two elements are clearly met. Landowners are a group of two or more persons and the object they sought to accomplish was preventing the construction of a resort at Remington Ranch. Contrary to the District Court\u2019s conclusion, the third element does not require \u201ca \u2018meeting of the minds\u2019 to use unlawful means\u201d; rather, the third element requires either a meeting of the minds on the object to be accomplished <em>or </em>a meeting of the minds on the course of action. <em>Schumacher, </em>\u00b6 18. As the District Court recognized, the \u201cevidence certainly indicates that the Harters, Sullivan, Hunt, and others did not want the Remington Resort to come to fruition ... and that they agreed action should be taken to stop the development of the Resort.\u201d Accordingly, there was a meeting of the minds as to the object to be accomplished and element three is therefore met as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">\u00b626 The fourth civil conspiracy element requires \u201cone or more unlawful overt acts.\u201d <em>Schumacher, </em>\u00b6 18. It is the unlawful act\u2014and not the conspiracy itself\u2014that gives rise to a civil conspiracy cause of action. <em>Schumacher, </em>\u00b6 18. Henry and Western Investments assert that the Harters\u2019 filing of the allegedly false UCC-1 and vendor\u2019s hen is the \u201cunlawful act\u201d because the filings constitute slander of title.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">\u00b627 Slander of title occurs when \u201cone maliciously publishes false matter which brings in question or disparages the title to property, thereby causing special damage to the owner.\u201d <em>Pryor v. Babcock Bldg. Corp., </em>2002 MT 68, \u00b6 10, 309 Mont. 222, 45 P.3d 35 (citations and internal quotations omitted). Although the District Court acknowledged that there may be a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether the Harters acted with malice in filing the hens, it concluded that Henry and Western Investments failed to establish that they suffered any damages as a result of the hens.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-9\">\u00b628 Henry asserts that he suffered \u201cdamages in the hundreds of thousands of dollars\u201d due to the Harters\u2019 filing of the allegedly false hens. He contends that the damages resulted when he was unable to sell the lots with the hens attached. Henry further alleges that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>suffered damages because he incurred attorney fees and other costs in removing the liens.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">\u00b629 The District Court determined, and we agree, that Henry and Western Investments failed to establish a triable factual issue that the Harters\u2019 filing of the hens caused them damages. As the District Court noted, the affidavits of the potential buyers of the lots\u2014on which Henry and Western Investments relied to show damages\u2014\u201ccontradict the notion that the Harters\u2019 filings prevented any lot sales.\u201d The affidavits of both potential buyers demonstrate that neither buyer had reached an agreement with Henry or Western Investments regarding the purchase of the lots. Further, neither of the potential buyers referenced the hens as the reason they did not buy the properties; rather, they both stated that, if anything, their decisions were affected by the animosity between Remington Ranch property owners and Henry.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">\u00b630 Additionally, there were three other encumbrances totaling nearly two million dollars on the properties at issue. As the District Court observed, Henry and Western Investments presented \u201cno argument or evidence\u201d that they sought a release or removal of all of those encumbrances. Henry and Western Investments therefore failed to demonstrate how title to the property was marketable. Finally, as the District Court emphasized, Henry \u201cadmitted he was not selling property in Remington Ranch during the time period the Harters filed their hens.\u201d In an October 2012 letter to a real estate company, Henry stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-7\">Here are some facts. I closed my RE/MAX office in Red Lodge, Montana December 31, 2010. I have not had any \u201creal estate services\u201d nor have I provided any since that date. I do own property in the area but my properties have not been listed for sale nor have I tried to market any of my properties since the closing of my RE/MAX offices.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">In the face of all of this evidence, Henry and Western Investments did not come forward with specific evidence, as opposed to speculation and argument, that the hens caused them damage.</p>\n<p id=\"A1v\">\u00b631  Because Henry and Western Investments failed to present material and substantial evidence sufficient to raise an issue of material fact regarding whether they suffered damages, the District Court correctly concluded that their slander of title claim failed as a matter of law. Henry and Western Investments\u2019 civil conspiracy claim consequently fails as well because they have not established both that Landowners committed an unlawful act and that they suffered damages as the proximate result thereof. Accordingly, albeit for slightly different reasons, the District Court correctly granted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>Landowners summary judgment on Henry\u2019s and Western Investments\u2019 civil conspiracy claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">\u00b632 We also are unpersuaded by Henry\u2019s and Western Investments\u2019 contentions regarding their tortious interference claim. Similar to civil conspiracy and slander of title, in order to assert a prima facie claim of tortious interference, Henry and Western Investments must prove that \u201cactual damages and loss resulted\u201d as a consequence of the alleged conduct. <em>Hughes v. Lynch, </em>2007 MT 177, \u00b6 25, 338 Mont. 214, 164 P.3d 913. Though Henry and Western Investments contend that whether Landowners\u2019 \u201cagreement to stop the development of the resort constitutes a tortious interference with their business is a question of fact for the jury,\u201d they have again offered only conclusory statements and speculative assertions that they suffered damages as a result thereof. Accordingly, we conclude that the District Court correctly granted Landowners summary judgment on Henry\u2019s and Western Investments\u2019 tortious interference claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">\u00b633 Finally, given our conclusions on Henry\u2019s and Western Investments\u2019 underlying counterclaims, we affirm the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to Landowners on the punitive damages claim. <em>See Finstad v. W. R. Grace &amp; Co.-Conn., </em>2000 MT 228, \u00b6 20, 301 Mont. 240, 8 P.3d 778 (\u201c[PJunitive damages are merely a component of recovery of the underlying civil cause of action.\u201d). Although Henry and Western Investments make additional arguments, we conclude that the contentions discussed above are dispositive. Based on the foregoing analysis, we hold that the District Court correctly granted Landowners summary judgment on each of Henry\u2019s and Western Investments\u2019 counterclaims.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">\u00b634 <em>2. Whether the District Court abused its discretion in denying Henry\u2019s and Cherewick\u2019s motion for attorney fees after they prevailed on the Plaintiff s claims against them.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">\u00b635 In a concise order, the District Court concluded that Henry and Cherewick were not prevailing parties on the claims Landowners brought in their initial complaint. The court therefore determined that Henry and Cherewick were not entitled to an award of attorney fees and costs. In addition, the District Court concluded, \u201chaving presided over this case for four years and understanding well the circumstances of this case and the respective positions of the parties, in an exercise of its inherent equitable powers, the Court concludes that equity does not support an award of attorney fees and costs to any party.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b384-9\">\u00b636 Henry and Cherewick assert that they are entitled to attorney fees and costs because they prevailed on all of Landowners\u2019 claims against them\u2014evidenced by the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in their favor on those claims. Henry and Cherewick invoke the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>Association\u2019s declarations, as well as the declarations of each of Remington Ranch\u2019s component subdivisions, arguing that Landowners\u2019 claims asserted violations of the various declarations. Henry and Cherewick point out that Landowners\u2019 claims are the only claims in the case subject to the various declarations\u2019 fee provisions. Thus, they contend that as prevailing parties on these claims, they should have been awarded attorney fees and costs, and that the District Court erroneously took into account Henry\u2019s lack of success on his counterclaims.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">\u00b637 Henry and Cherewick argue alternatively that the District Court erred by not considering whether they should be awarded attorney fees and costs under \u00a7 35-2-1306, MCA. They assert that Landowners\u2019 claims were derivative claims and that the District Court concluded that Landowners failed to meet the standing and procedural requirements of \u00a7 35-2-1301, MCA. Henry and Cherewick thus assert that Landowners commenced and maintained their derivative claims without reasonable cause and they were accordingly entitled to attorney fees pursuant to the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"ALYG\">\u00b638  The general rule is that \u201cattorney fees will not be awarded to the prevailing party in a lawsuit\u201d absent statutory or contractual authority. <em>Svee, </em>\u00b6 18. As Henry and Cherewick correctly point out, Landowners asserted claims under the various declarations and those declarations provide contractual authority for awarding the prevailing party attorney fees and costs. There is no \u201cprevailing party,\u201d however, where both sides \u201cgain a victory but also suffer a loss.\u201d <em>Whipps, </em>\u00b6 9 <em>(citing H-D Irrigating, Inc. v. Kimble Props., Inc., </em>2000 MT 212, \u00b6 60, 301 Mont. 34, 8 P.3d 95).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">\u00b639 Focusing exclusively on Landowners\u2019 claims against Henry and Cherewick, we find no abuse of discretion in the District Court\u2019s conclusion that both sides gained a victory but also suffered a loss. During the course of the litigation, Landowners succeeded on several claims, mainly: securing a court-supervised election of new directors for the Association; persuading the court to appoint a receiver to manage the transition from the old board of directors to the new board; and obtaining an inspection of the Association\u2019s books and records. Henry and Cherewick obviously prevailed as well because at the end of the litigation they were granted summary judgment on Landowners\u2019 claims. The District Court therefore did not act arbitrarily in concluding that neither side could claim prevailing party status.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">\u00b640 Finally, Henry\u2019s and Cherewick\u2019s arguments under \u00a7 35-2-1306, MCA, are misplaced. Even if Landowners\u2019 action constituted a derivative action, \u00a7 35-2-1306, MCA, simply gives the court the option of awarding attorney fees and costs; the statute does not require the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>court to award attorney fees. Section 35-2-1306, MCA (\u201cOn termination of the derivative proceeding, the court <em>may </em>order... the complainant to pay any defendant\u2019s reasonable expenses, including attorney fees ....\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"A-0N\">\u00b641 The District Court presided over this contentious, complicated case for nearly five years. The court understood the circumstances and the parties\u2019 positions well. We conclude that the District Court did not commit legal error or abuse its discretion in denying Henry\u2019s and Cherewick\u2019s motion for attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">\u00b642 The District Court\u2019s judgment is affirmed in all respects.</p>\n<judges id=\"b386-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES McKINNON, WHEAT and SHEA concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b376-12\"> The Plaintiffs remaining in the action are Appellees Michael Sullivan, Joy Hunt, Dr. Herschel Harter, and Mary Beth Harter.
