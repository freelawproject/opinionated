We affirm and restate the issues as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AvI\"><em>1. Did the District Court improperly instruct the jury, committing plain </em>error?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ap7\">\n<em>2. Was defense counsel ineffective for failing to submit a jury instruction defining the statutory term \u201cknowing\u201d?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AbP\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"AAq\">\u00b62 Shelley Nelson (Nelson), Nuessle\u2019s former girlfriend, stole a vehicle in Lewistown and drove it to Thompson Falls. Acting on a tip, law enforcement officers from the City of Thompson Falls, Sanders County, and the Montana Highway Patrol converged on the home of Sharon Dexter (Dexter), where Nelson and the stolen vehicle were reported to be.</p>\n<p id=\"A1S\">\u00b63 Dexter, her son, John Dexter, Nuessle, and Nelson were in the Dexter residence when police arrived. Two officers approached the front door of the residence while a third officer took a position near the back door. One officer heard people running inside the house. The two officers at the front door advised Dexter they had a warrant for Nelson\u2019s arrest, and asked if Nelson was inside. Dexter answered that she believed Nelson was inside and gave permission to the officers to enter and search for Nelson.</p>\n<p id=\"auc-dedup-0\">\u00b64 Dexter led officers through the living room and down the hallway to the bedrooms. Upon arriving at the back bedroom, the officers encountered Nuessle, who was sitting on a bed. Nuessle reported that Nelson had fled out the back door. However, the officer stationed outside the back door stated that Nuessle had looked outside the door, observed the law enforcement presence, and retreated back inside the residence. No one else exited the residence. Police located Nelson underneath the headboard of the bed upon which Nuessle had been sitting, and arrested her.</p>\n<p id=\"AH8\">\u00b65 Nelson initially told officers that Nuessle was not involved in hiding her from police. She later admitted that she hid from officers, knowing law enforcement was looking for her, and that Nuessle had aided her in hiding, including telling officers that she had fled from the residence, which was not true. Nelson explained that she had initially lied about Nuessle\u2019s involvement because she was \u201ccovering for [Nuessle]\u201d and \u201cdidn\u2019t want him to get in trouble.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AA-\">\u00b66 Nuessle was charged with Obstructing Justice under \u00a7 45-7-303(2)(a), MCA, which provides that \u201c[a] person commits the offense of obstructing justice if, knowing another person is an offender, the person purposely: (a) harbors or conceals an offender.\u201d Nelson pled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>guilty to theft charges and testified at Nuessle\u2019s trial, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AII\">[Nuessle] came running in from the kitchen area and he said, oh shit, let\u2019s hide, let\u2019s hide you, you know, let\u2019s hide you; run straight back to his bedroom. He lifted up part of the bed to help me under it. I crawled under. He put it back down, and I said, oh, they\u2019re going to know I\u2019m here obviously if you don\u2019t throw some of my stuff under here. So he threw some of my stuff under there and hid me under the bed. And then he sat on the bed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AQkc\">Nuessle also testified, stating that he did not know Nelson had stolen the pickup, but, rather, was under the impression Nelson had borrowed the pickup from a friend. He denied knowing that Nelson was under the bed.</p>\n<p id=\"AB8\">\u00b67 The jury instructions included the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AXr\">Instruction No. 8</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AEpt\">A person commits the offense of obstructing justice if, knowing a person is an offender, he purposely harbors or conceals an offender.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AQDL\">Instruction No. 9</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AhsK\">To convict the Defendant of the charge of obstructing justice, the State must prove the following elements:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ajt-dedup-0\">1. That the Defendant knew that Shelly Nelson was an offender; AND</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AQ1\">2. That the Defendant harbored or concealed Shelly Nelson. AND</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"aqc-dedup-0\">3. That the Defendant acted purposely.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AfS-\">The instructions defined \u201cpurposely\u201d but did not separately define \u201cknowing\u201d or \u201cknew.\u201d Nuessle did not offer an instruction defining these terms. Nuessle was convicted by the jury. He appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"Aaf\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"Ax6P\">\u00b68 We review jury instructions in criminal cases to determine whether the instructions as a whole fully and fairly instruct the jury on the applicable law. <em>State v. Williams, </em>2015 MT 247, \u00b6 10, 380 Mont. 445, 358 P.3d 127 (citing <em>State v. Myran, </em>2012 MT 252, \u00b6 16, 366 Mont. 532, 289 P.3d 118).</p>\n<p id=\"A-Y\">\u00b69 Claims of ineffective assistance of counsel that are reviewed on direct appeal present mixed questions of law and fact, which we review <em>de novo. State v. Root, </em>2015 MT 310, \u00b6 8, 381 Mont. 314, 359 P.3d 1088; <em>State v. Chafee, </em>2014 MT 226, \u00b6 11, 376 Mont. 267, 332 P.3d 240 (citing <em>State v. Ugalde, </em>2013 MT 308, \u00b6 28, 372 Mont. 234, 311 P.3d 772).</p>\n<p id=\"AXgl\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AqY\">\u00b610 <em>1. Did the District Court improperly instruct the jury, committing plain </em>error?</p>\n<p id=\"aub-dedup-0\">\u00b611 Nuessle argues that \u201cthe failure to include a jury instruction defining the \u2018knowing\u2019 element of 10 Ibstructing [JJustice relieved the State of its burden to prove Nuessle was aware that [Nelson] was an offender,\u201d and, thus, a requisite mental state was not established and his due process rights were violated. Because neither an objection was made nor an instruction offered by his counsel, Neussle asks that this Court exercise plain error review or, alternatively, conclude his counsel rendered ineffective assistance. Neussle asks that his trial be vacated and a new trial ordered. The State responds that plain error review is inappropriate \u201cbecause the jury was instructed regarding all of the elements of the offense of obstructing justice\u201d and, therefore, Nuessle\u2019s due process rights were not violated. Further, the State argues the meaning of the terms \u201cknowing\u201d and \u201cknew\u201d are easily comprehended by jurors and Nuessle was not prejudiced by the lack of a definitional instruction. The State contends it was not relieved of proving an element of the offense, and clearly proved that Nuessle knew or was aware that Nelson was an offender.</p>\n<p id=\"A_Ad\">\u00b612 Obtaining plain error review of unpreserved issues requires the appellant to: (1) show \u201cthe claimed error implicates a fundamental right\u201d; and (2) \u201cfirmly convince this Court that failure to review would result in a manifest miscarriage of justice, leave unsettled the question of the fundamental fairness of the trial proceedings, or compromise the integrity of the judicial process.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>\u00b6 16 (citing <em>State v. Carnes, </em>2015 MT 101, \u00b6 13, 378 Mont. 482, 346 P.3d 1120); <em>accord State v. Favel, </em>2015 MT 336, 381 Mont. 472, 362 P.3d 1126. \u201cWe invoke plain error review sparingly, on a case-by-case basis, according to narrow circumstances, and by considering the totality of the circumstances.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>\u00b6 16 (citing <em>State v. Wilson, </em>2011 MT 277, \u00b6 16, 362 Mont. 416, 264 P.3d 1146). Finally, we bear in mind the appellant \u201ccarries the burden of proof.\u201d <em>Favel, </em>\u00b6 27 (citing <em>State v. Hart, </em>2000 MT 332, \u00b6 52, 303 Mont. 71, 15 P.3d 917).</p>\n<p id=\"AS3N\">\u00b613 Obstructing Justice by harboring or concealing an offender, \u00a745-7-303(2)(a), MCA, uniquely references two mental states. However, the general mental state, formerly known in Montana law as the <em>mens rea, </em>for commission of this crime is \u201cpurposely.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>defines <em>mens rea </em>as: \u201cThe state of mind that the prosecution, to secure a conviction, must prove that a defendant had <em>when committing </em>a crime. ... <em>[Mens rea] </em>describes the state of mind or inattention that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number><em>together with its accompanying conduct, </em>the criminal law defines as an offense.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1134-35 (Bryan A. Garner ed., 10th ed. 2014) (emphasis added). Thus, the harboring or concealing conduct criminalized by \u00a7 45-7-303(2)(a), MCA, must be committed purposely. In addition, the elements of the offense require the defendant to know a particular fact: that the person he was harboring was an offender.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AHxX\">\u00b614  The record reveals the defense addressed the elements of Obstructing Justice in its opening statement, and both sides addressed the elements during their closing arguments. The jury was properly instructed on all of the elements of the offense, including the requirement that Neussle knew Nelson was an offender. Even without an instruction defining \u201cknowing,\u201d the State was not relieved of its burden to prove the \u201cknowing\u201d element, and the jury was well aware of the burden. We would note that a jury \u201cneed not be instructed on words or phrases of common understanding or meaning.\u201d <em>State v. Crisp, </em>249 Mont. 199, 205, 814 P.2d 981, 984 (1991) (citing <em>State v. Gould, </em>216 Mont. 455, 477, 704 P.2d 20, 34 (1985)).</p>\n<p id=\"amo-dedup-0\">\u00b615 We decline to undertake consideration of the merits of the instruction issue pursuant to the plain error doctrine because failure to review would not \u201cresult in a manifest miscarriage of justice, leave unsettled the question of the fundamental fairness of the trial proceedings, or compromise the integrity of the judicial process.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>\u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"Aqxl\">\u00b616 <em>2. Was defense counsel ineffective for failing to submit a jury instruction defining the statutory term \u201cknowing\u201d?</em></p>\n<p id=\"AgI8\">\u00b617 We evaluate ineffective assistance of counsel claims under the two-prong test established in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052 (1984) and <em>Whitlow v. State, </em>2008 MT 140, 343 Mont. 90, 183 P.3d 861. A defendant must show that his attorney\u2019s performance was deficient by demonstrating that it fell below an objective standard of reasonableness, and that the attorney\u2019s deficient performance prejudiced the defense. <em>Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 10. \u201cA defendant must satisfy both prongs of this test in order to prevail on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim.\u201d <em>Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 11. \u201c[T]he proper measure of counsel\u2019s performance is objective reasonableness.\u201d <em>Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"azv-dedup-0\">\u00b618 Nuessle argues that his trial counsel was ineffective because she failed to propose a jury instruction defining \u201cknowing\u201d or \u201cknew.\u201d Nuessle contends these actions reduced the State\u2019s burden as to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>mental state element of the offense and that there was no plausible justification for trial counsel\u2019s failure to submit the instruction. The State responds that Nuessle\u2019s defense counsel performed reasonably and within established professional norms. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"A1uV\">\u00b619  Within the stated elements of the offense, the word \u201cknowing,\u201d as explained above, fulfilled a limited purpose that was commonly understood by the jurors, and was emphasized by the parties during trial. The State\u2019s burden was not reduced by the absence of a specific instruction defining the term, and defense counsel\u2019s performance was not deficient for failing to offer such an instruction. Therefore, Nuessle has not established that he received ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"AAbU\">\u00b620 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"A-g\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES McKINNON, WHEAT and SHEA concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"AqM2\"> \u201cOffender\u201d is defined as \u201ca person who has been or is liable to be arrested, charged, convicted, or punished for a public offense.\u201d Section 45-7-303(1), MCA.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
