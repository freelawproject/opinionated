Profit Sharing Plan and Trust for the Benefit of Stephen D. Behlmer, M.D. (Behlmer), appeals from the order of the First Judicial District Court, Lewis and Clark County, partially granting summary judgment to Appellee Mountain West Farm Bureau Mutual Insurance Company (Mountain West), holding that certain insurance proceeds must be deposited into the District Court, denying Behlmer\u2019s motion for attorneys\u2019 fees and costs, and not ruling on the availability of post-judgment interest. Mountain West cross-appeals the District Court\u2019s summary judgment ruling that determined the subject insurance policy provided coverage for Behlmer\u2019s claim. We address only the cross-appeal and reverse the District Court\u2019s coverage determination. We do not reach Behlmer\u2019s appellate issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">\u00b62 We restate the issue as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-8\">\n<em>Did the District Court err by holding there was coverage for the Corral Fire damage under Mountain West\u2019s commercial automobile policy?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-9\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b323-10\">\u00b63 Robert S. Fitte (Fitte) is a property owner in the Scratchgravel Hills in Lewis and Clark County, who runs a construction business out of his home. Fitte\u2019s property contained pine trees that had been killed by beetles. In June 2012, Fitte, concerned about potential damage that could occur if a tree fell, decided to cut down two beetle-killed pine trees on his property. Fitte was concerned that the trees might fall on his work vehicles, ladders, and scaffolding. He testified in his deposition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-11\">The tops of the trees had already blown over and damaged the fence in two spots. I was worried because that\u2019s where I park my work vehicles if the tree itself blew over it would take out my work vehicles, and I keep ladders and scaffolds there from time to time when they\u2019re not on the job site.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-12\">\u00b64 On June 21, 2012, Fitte cut down the second tree, after felling the first tree earlier. Fitte trimmed the branches off the trees and cut the trunks into eight-foot logs, stacking them on his property with the intention of either selling or giving them away. Pursuant to a burn permit, Fitte started a fire to burn the branches from the trees so that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>the branches would not take up space on his property. He agreed in his deposition that, once he had felled both trees, there \u201cwas no longer a risk of those trees falling on [my] business vehicles or [my] scaffold or [my] ladders.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">\u00b65 Two days later, a fire rose from the ashes of Fitte\u2019s burn and erupted into a wildfire that became known as the Corral Fire, as we have previously noted. <em>See Associated Dermatology &amp; Skin Cancer Clinic of Helena, P.C. Profit Sharing Plan and Trust for the Benefit of Stephen D. Behlmer, M.D. v. Fitte, </em>2016 MT 349, \u00b6 3, 386 Mont. 150, 388 P.3d 632 [hereinafter <em>Associated Dermatology I]. </em>The Corral Fire burned over 1,800 acres owned by approximately 35 landowners, including Behlmer\u2019s 224-acre parcel, and consumed four dwellings, timber, and other personal property.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">\u00b66 At the time of the fire, Fitte carried two insurance policies issued by Mountain West that provided three coverages: a $300,000 homeowners policy; and a commercial policy that provided $1,000,000 in coverage for commercial general liability (CGL) and $500,000 in coverage for commercial automobiles. Only the commercial automobile coverage is at issue in this appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">\u00b67 Fitte conceded negligence and, following arbitration on damages, stipulated to entry of a judgment in favor of Behlmer in the amount of $500,000, which was entered by the District Court on September 13, 2013. Fitte and Behlmer subsequently entered into an agreement in which Fitte assigned his rights in the Mountain West policies to Behlmer in exchange for an agreement that Behlmer would not execute against Fitte personally. Behlmer filed this action seeking, inter alia, a declaration that the automobile policy provided coverage for the Corral Fire damages and enforcement of its judgment against Fitte. Mountain West counterclaimed for a declaration that the automobile policy did not provide coverage. Both parties moved for summary judgment on the coverage issue and the District Court held in favor of Behlmer, reasoning that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-7\">By removing and disposing trees to prevent damage to his vehicles, Fitte caused the Corral Fire. Thus, [Behlmer\u2019s] property damage flowed from, grew out of, or originated from Fitte maintaining his insured vehicle.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>(Internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">\u00b68 Mountain West appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">\u00b69 This Court reviews a district court\u2019s order on a motion for summary judgment by applying the same criteria as the district court under M. R. Civ. P. 56. <em>Parker v. Safeco Ins. Co. of Am., </em>2016 MT 173, \u00b6 15, 384 Mont. 125, 376 P.3d 114 (citing <em>Thornton v. Flathead Cnty., </em>2009 MT 367, \u00b6 13, 353 Mont. 252, 220 P.3d 395).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">\u00b610 The interpretation of an insurance policy presents a question of law, which we review for correctness. <em>Parker, </em>\u00b6 14 (citing <em>Wendell v.

When interpreting the contract, we \u201cgive the terms and words used in an insurance contract their usual meaning and construe them using common sense.\u201d <em>Travelers Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. v.

The coverage question here is whether the property damage \u201cresult[ed] from the ownership, maintenance or use of\u2019 Fitte\u2019s covered vehicles.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>\u00b613 Mountain West\u2019s initial argument is that merely \u201cpreventing harm\u201d to a vehicle by cutting down trees is not \u201cmaintenance\u201d of a vehicle, but, rather, \u201cmaintenance\u201d consists of \u201crepairing or working on an intrinsic part\u201d of a vehicle. Alternatively, Mountain West argues that, even assuming that maintenance could encompass the prevention of harm to a vehicle, Fitte\u2019s subsequent burning of the branches did not prevent any harm, but instead \u201cdispos [ed] of rubbish which <em>at a previous time may </em>have posed a risk,\u201d adding that \u201cany potential threat to the vehicles from the falling tree limbs ended when the trees were on the ground.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) As such, Mountain West argues that \u201cFitte did not burn the branches to eliminate a risk to his vehicles,\u201d and that the Corral Fire damages resulted from Fitte\u2019s decision about the method of <em>disposing </em>of the tree branches.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">\u00b614 Behlmer responds that the policy provides coverage \u201cbecause the Corral Fire and the damage it caused resulted from Fitte maintaining his insured vehicles.\u201d Behlmer argues that the District Court correctly reasoned that Fitte was engaging in \u201cmaintenance\u201d because his actions were done \u201cto preserve or keep [his insured vehicles] in an existing state or condition.\u201d Thus, Behlmer argues that \u201ca causal relationship existed here between the fire and the vehicle\u2019s maintenance,\u201d because, quoting the District Court, \u201c[t]he obvious and necessary result of cutting down trees is the requirement to dispose of them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">\u00b615 We have once addressed the meaning of the word \u201cmaintenance,\u201d albeit in a non-insurance context. In <em>Link v. State, </em>180 Mont. 469, 591 P.2d 214 (1979), cited by Behlmer, the Montana State Park Commission (Park Commission) entered into a contract in 1946 with the Link Bros, partnership that granted the partnership the right to operate the concession service at the Lewis and Clark Caverns State Park, and required that the partnership construct certain improvements that would become the property of the Park Commission, including a railroad or tramway to carry visitors from the concession area to the caverns. <em>Link, </em>180 Mont. at 471, 591 P.2d at 216. Link Bros, operated the tramway for three years before entering into a supplemental agreement with the Park Commission in which the Park Commission agreed to \u201c \u2018take over the operation and maintenance of the said mountain railroad\u2019, and to \u2018operate and maintain same at its own expense.\u2019 <em>\u2019\u2019Link, </em>180 Mont. at 472, 591 P.2d at 216 (quoting the agreement). The Park Commission agreed to pay Link Bros, a portion of the fares in recognition of their investment in the improvements. <em>Link, </em>180 Mont. at 472, 591 P.2d at 216. In 1973, a gear in the tramway hoist broke and the Park Commission did not repair it, but instead removed the tramway and replaced it with a walking path in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>its place. <em>Link, </em>180 Mont. at 472-73, 591 P.2d at 217. Addressing Link Bros.\u2019 breach of contract claim, we quoted the Texas Supreme Court, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-4\">\u201cTo \u2018maintain\u2019 means to preserve or keep in an existing state or condition and embraces acts of repair and other acts to prevent a decline, lapse, or cessation from that state of condition ...\u201d and \"... includes the idea of keeping in repair, but has much broader meaning involving the concept of supporting, sustaining, carrying on and continuing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-5\"><em>Link, </em>180 Mont. at 477, 591 P.2d at 219 (quoting <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Pan Am. Ins. Co., </em>437 S.W.2d 542, 545 (Tex. 1969)). We held that the Park Commission\u2019s \u201cfailure to maintain and refusal to operate the system\u201d was a breach of the contractual requirement to \u201coperate and maintain\u201d the tramway. <em>Link, </em>180 Mont. at 478, 591 P.2d at 219.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">\u00b616 Intrinsic within the definition of \u201cmaintenance\u201d we cited in <em>Link </em>was that the acts of \u201cpreservation\u201d or \u201crepair\u201d or \u201csupport\u201d or \u201csustaining\u201d or \u201ccontinuing\u201d would occur <em>on </em>the item being maintained. \u201cMaintenance\u201d as constituting work on the actual object is a meaning commonly understood by other courts. \u201cMaintenance\u201d includes \u201cthe act of repairing the covered automobile.\u201d 8A Steven Plitt et al., <em>Couch on Insurance </em>\u00a7 119:36 (3d ed. 2014) (citing Louisiana, Pennsylvania, Texas, Wisconsin, and New York decisions). In an automobile insurance contract, New York defined \u201cmaintenance\u201d as \u201cperformance of work on an intrinsic part of the mechanism of the car and its overall function.\u201d <em>Guishard v. Gen. Sec. Ins. Co., </em>875 N.E.2d 881, 882 (N.Y. 2007) (internal quotations omitted). Similarly, Oklahoma defined \u201cmaintenance\u201d in an automobile insurance contract as \u201call acts which come within its ordinary scope and meaning, including acts of commission or omission relative to the external and mechanical condition of a vehicle.\u201d <em>Ply v. Nat\u2019l Union Fire Ins. Co., </em>81 P.3d 643, 649 n.13 (Okla. 2003). \u201cMaintenance\u201d is defined as the \u201ccare and work put into property to keep it operating and productive; general repair and upkeep.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1097 (Bryan A. Garner ed., 10th ed. 2014).</p>\n<p id=\"AL1\">\u00b617  Even if we were to assume, for sake of argument, that cutting down trees constituted maintenance of a vehicle, the policy would not extend coverage for the damages here. Placing the word \u201cmaintenance\u201d back within the provision at issue requires that the damage \u201cresult from\u201d the maintenance of the covered vehicles. Fitte\u2019s decision to dispose of the branches by burning them and his action of starting the fire occurred after the trees had been cut down. As Fitte admitted in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>his deposition, the perceived risk to his vehicles was eliminated when he felled the trees. Fitte could have disposed of the trees in any number of ways, demonstrating that his decision to burn the branches was not an inherent part of vehicle maintenance. <em>See Wendell, </em>\u00b6 54 (the phrase \u201carise out of the use [of a vehicle]\u201d meant the injuries must \u201coriginate from, or grow out of, or flow from the use of the ... vehicle.\u201d). Thus, the District Court\u2019s conclusion that burning the trees was a necessary part of preventing damage to, and thus maintaining, Fitte\u2019s vehicles, was incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">\u00b618 Accordingly, the District Court\u2019s declaration of coverage under the Mountain West commercial automobile policy is reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b328-5\">JUSTICES SHEA, McKINNON, BAKER and WHEAT concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b324-8\"> Mountain West conceded coverage under the homeowners policy.
