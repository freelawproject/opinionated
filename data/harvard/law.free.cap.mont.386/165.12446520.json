(Ryffel Partnership) appeals from a jury verdict entered in the Eighteenth Judicial District Court, Gallatin County. The jury found that Ryffel Partnership had breached two oral contracts with the Appellee Alpine Construction (Alpine), but awarded zero damages. The first agreement was entered into in January of 2007 and the second agreement was entered into in September of 2007. Although awarding zero damages for Ryffel Partnership\u2019s breach, the jury found Ryffel Partnership was unjustly enriched by Alpine\u2019s labor and awarded Alpine $50,348.18 in damages. Finally, the jury awarded $25,000 to Alpine for Ryffel Partnership\u2019s breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.</p>\n<p id=\"AsSV\">\u00b62 The District Court issued an order pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 59, amending the judgment to assign the jury\u2019s damages award for unjust enrichment to its finding that Ryffel Partnership breached its contract. The District Court did so upon the basis that breach of contract and unjust enrichment are inconsistent legal theories of recovery. The District Court\u2019s order also struck the jury\u2019s award of $25,000 for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, concluding no evidence in the record supported the award. Alpine filed a motion to amend the judgment for pre-judgment interest pursuant to \u00a7 27-1-211, MCA, which the District Court denied by allowing the motion to expire. In its appeal, Ryffel Partnership seeks anew trial, alleging the jury\u2019s verdict <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>was inconsistent and that there was not substantial evidence to support breach of the second agreement entered into in September of 2007. Ryffel Partnership does not raise any issue regarding the first agreement entered into in January of2007, which the jury found it had also breached. Alpine cross-appeals the District Court\u2019s denial of prejudgment interest. We affirm the District Court\u2019s ruling, including its denial of pre-judgment interest, and deny Ryffel Partnership\u2019s appeal to review the verdict for lack of substantial evidence. We restate the issues on appeal as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-4\">\n<em>1. Whether the jury\u2019s verdict regarding the parties\u2019 second agreement was supported by substantial evidence.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-5\">\n<em>2. Whether the District Court erred in denying Ryffel Partnership\u2019s motion for a new trial based on an inconsistent or illegal jury verdict.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-6\">\n<em>3. Whether the District Court erred in denying Alpine\u2019s motion for pre-judgment interest pursuant to \u00a7 27-1-211, MCA.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">\u00b63 Although James Ryffel (Ryffel) was born in Bozeman, Montana, Ryffel Partnership is a Texas-based partnership consisting of Ryffel, his wife, and a family trust as partners. Ryffel often travels to Montana and purchased the property at issue because of its scenic nature and beauty, along with its suitability as a location for a family home. Part of the property\u2019s appeal to Ryffel and his wife were the statuesque \u201cspecimen trees\u201d and the \u201chilly knoll\u201d upon which many of these trees were located.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-9\">\u00b64 Ryffel and his wife wanted to build a home on the property that would, among other things, look upon the beauty of the knoll and its trees. To implement that vision, Ryffel hired Steve Hanson (Hanson) as a general contractor to oversee the building and logging work the project would require. Hanson is an experienced builder of custom log homes. Ryffel\u2019s testimony reflects that, overall, he wanted to cut only the trees necessary to build a road on the property to the home, the trees to build the home itself, thin those trees that then remained on the property, clear those trees that were dead and fallen, and then preserve specimen trees greater than 24 inches in diameter. To those ends, some trees were specially marked for use as house logs in the upcoming construction of the Ryffel Partnership residence on the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-10\">\u00b65 Bob Rammers (Rammers) is one of the owners of Alpine Construction. Seeking the potentially substantial logging business on the Ryffel Partnership property, Rammers met Hanson through a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>mutual acquaintance, Scott Cooper (Cooper). Cooper, Rammers, and Hanson all gathered on the Ryffel Partnership property in January of 2007, and discussed the job. Hanson hired Alpine for logging work on the property: logs were to be delivered to the upper landing where the house would be built, and the thinning would have to be done within parameters, i.e. no specimen trees greater than 24 inches would be cut. Hanson hired Alpine in January of 2007. He showed Rammers where the house logs were and where they should be placed for use in construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">\u00b66 Although Hanson could not remember if Rammers gave him a rate sheet for the work, Cooper and Rammers both testified that the terms of the agreement were for Alpine to be paid by the hour. Rammers believed that an hourly rate was the only acceptable payment method under the circumstances because all of the \u201cgood logs\u201d were to be used for the Ryffel Partnership house construction, while all of the \u201cbutts, tips, and crooked logs\u201d were to go to the mill. However, Rammers contended that it was impossible for him to determine beforehand what should stay on the property, and what should go to the mill, making it difficult to estimate the labor on a lump sum basis. Rammers testified that payments from what he took to the mill were to be offset against Alpine\u2019s costs, and that Alpine would charge a flat fee for delivering each load to the mill. Rammers also testified that Hanson never mentioned the specimen tree restrictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">\u00b67 Hanson explained that Alpine performed side jobs as well. According to Hanson, Alpine hauled materials and equipment, and cleared snow and ice from the property\u2019s road to ensure timely deliveries of material and the safe traversal of workers constructing the house. Alpine also cleared trees along the road, and hauled logs that would later serve as trusses for the home. Alpine\u2019s work on the road was frequent, as the road was cleared of materials every time someone needed to travel upon it\u2014at least once or twice per day. Alpine also backfilled around the house\u2019s foundation.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">\u00b68 Alpine sent an invoice dated February 4, 2007, to Ryffel and Hanson for road work. The invoice billed an hourly rate, which Ryffel and Hanson testified was acceptable, because the road work was considered \u201cside work.\u201d Alpine sent another invoice for hourly work on March 1, 2007, for building a de-barker. Ryffel testified that this too was considered side work. Ryffel stated that he received several such invoices, dated between May and September, 2007, for hourly labor and equipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">\u00b69 Ryffel questioned the fairness of one of those invoices for $97,000 and so asked Rammers to meet to discuss it. This meeting would form <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>the basis of the parties\u2019 second agreement. At that meeting in September 2007, Rammers and Ryffel discussed the invoices accrued so far, and attempted to concur on the terms of their agreement going forward. Ryffel was concerned in part, because there was no set agreement between Ryffel Partnership and Alpine concerning a rate for the logging work. Hanson was convinced that Alpine was not to be paid an hourly rate for logging, a fact supported by Ryffel Partnership\u2019s expert witness who believed that an hourly rate for logging is unusual in the industry. Ostensibly, under the terms of this second agreement and according to Rammers, Alpine would now log trees on the ground, haul them to the mill, deduct the cost of hauling them from the money received at the mill, and then evenly split the remaining proceeds with Ryffel Partnership. Rammers\u2019 testimony indicated that Ryffel Partnership\u2019s share of the proceeds was to be applied first to any outstanding balance owed to Alpine. Rammers also agreed Alpine would no longer bill by the hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">\u00b610 Ryffel\u2019s memory of that meeting and the terms of the resulting agreement differed from Rammers\u2019. In Ryffel\u2019s recollection, he had only agreed to compensate Alpine with a share of the logging proceeds, not an hourly rate. Additionally, he understood that Rammers had encountered difficulty removing felled trees from a steep area and so needed to purchase a line machine. Ryffel testified that he agreed at that meeting to pay $45,000 for a line machine which Rammers would then use to haul logs from the base of the knoll for transportation to the mill. Ryffel\u2019s understanding was that Rammers would then transport the logs to the mill, and proceeds therefrom would be evenly split. This meeting and agreement, in Ryffel\u2019s view, nullified any past agreements the parties may have had and that going forward no more trees would be cut on the property at all, including \u201cspecimen trees\u201d on the knoll.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">\u00b611 Ryffel sent Alpine the check for $45,000, along with a letter that attempted to memorialize the terms of the agreement reached in the September meeting with Rammers. The letter, never signed by Rammers, stated that \u201c[t]his agreement will replace any previous agreements or invoices.\u201d However, the letter was cursory for a document purporting to replace a timber harvesting agreement and a series of past invoices. The only definite term the letter addressed was that 50% of any log sale was to be forwarded to Ryffel\u2019s office, and even that term was hobbled by a vague description of what logs were to be included as part of the deal. Although the letter confirmed that the check for $45,000 was enclosed, it did not specify any use for the funds\u2014no line machine was mentioned. The letter presented no other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>terms or significant details and was in fact only six sentences long, including the sentence about enclosing the check.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">\u00b612 Rammers\u2019 testimony differed from Ryffel\u2019s recollection as to these facts regarding their second agreement. Rammers\u2019 testimony indicated he never told Ryffel he needed a line machine and he never asked Ryffel for $45,000 to purchase the line machine\u2014Ryffel offered it. Furthermore, Rammers testified that he did not use the check to purchase a line machine because he had already purchased one prior to the meeting with Ryffel; the meeting did not eliminate any prior invoices due because Ryffel Partnership\u2019s balance due at the time was substantial; and hauling charges were not to come out of Alpine\u2019s share of the logging proceeds. Thus, according to Rammers, the letter Ryffel sent did not accurately reflect at all the agreement reached at the meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">\u00b613 Despite the ambiguities, vagaries, and misunderstandings arising out of these oral agreements, Alpine sent invoices and Ryffel Partnership sent payments. Alpine\u2019s bookkeeper, Rammers\u2019 wife Shirley Rammers (Shirley), testified at trial to invoices that were paid and invoices that were left unpaid. She testified that some invoices were paid in full: an invoice for $6,464.32 and one for $19,746. Also, some payments from the logging proceeds were applied to Ryffel Partnership\u2019s outstanding running balance: a payment for $6,292.48 and one for $10,005.18. Ryffel Partnership\u2019s account was similarly credited $27,250 when Alpine needed to purchase equipment from Ryffel Partnership. Additionally, Alpine applied the check for $45,000 to a series of invoices with outstanding balances, thereby reducing the total amount Ryffel Partnership owed to $90,902.20.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">\u00b614 This pattern of work, invoices, credits, and fluctuating balances continued through the end of September 2007, without any written agreement between the parties, and in spite of Shirley\u2019s and Rammers\u2019 failed attempts to contact Ryffel via telephone to discuss his letter. Additionally, the record is devoid of written attempts by Alpine to discuss the letter: Alpine sent no emails, letters by post, or faxes to clarify or repudiate Ryffel\u2019s letter. Nevertheless, Alpine continued to log and clear the land, generate invoices, assess Ryffel Partnership the hauling costs, deduct hauling costs from the logging proceeds, and apply Ryffel Partnership\u2019s share of those proceeds toward invoices which remained outstanding. In the end, Shirley\u2019s testimony reflected that, after she had applied all of the logging credits, Ryffel Partnership\u2019s account still had a balance due of $49,281.12, which Ryffel Partnership never paid. After Alpine applied finance charges through April of 2008, the amount totaled $50,348.18. In contrast, by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>calculation of Ryffel Partnership\u2019s expert, Alpine owed Ryffel Partnership $41,105.88 from the sale of the logs.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\">\u00b615 The misunderstandings and nebulous terms of these oral agreements culminated in the instant suit when Ryffel and his family visited the property in December of 2007, for Christmas. Ryffel was appalled to see that the specimen trees on the knoll, which in his remembrance had been specifically protected, were now gone from the property. Hanson testified that he had not authorized Rammers to cut them, but Rammers did not think he needed Hanson\u2019s authorization to do so. Rammers also believed that the logging plan had changed under the oral agreement in September, which Ryffel\u2019s letter had attempted to memorialize. Rammers\u2019 memory at trial was that the line machine\u2019s whole purpose was to remove trees from the steep downslope of the knoll, and that regardless, many of those specimen trees had already been removed prior to the September meeting with Ryffel. Whatever the reason for it, Rammers admitted he was the one who had removed them.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">\u00b616 In the trial that followed, the jury was instructed to find whether either of the parties had breached either of two oral contracts between Alpine and Ryffel Partnership, through its representative officer, Ryffel\u2014one agreement arising from the initial meeting of Rammers, Hanson, and Ryffel in January of 2007; and one from the meeting in September of 2007 between Rammers and Ryffel. The jury was also tasked with deciding whether either party had been unjustly enriched, and to what extent, if any, the parties had suffered damages from either a breach of contract or unjust enrichment. The jury found in favor of Alpine\u2014that Ryffel Partnership had breached both its January and September, 2007 oral contracts, but that Alpine should be awarded no damages for either breach. However, the jury also found that Ryffel Partnership had been unjustly enriched by accepting work done by Alpine on its property, for which it did not provide compensation. For that unjust enrichment, the jury awarded $50,348.18, the same sum reflected in Alpine\u2019s books after finance charges were added, as of April 2008. Last, the jury found that Ryffel Partnership had breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, for which the jury awarded $25,000 in damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">\u00b617 After the jury rendered its verdict, Alpine filed a motion under M. R. Civ. P. 59 and 60 to amend the judgment to include pre-judgment interest, upon which the trial court did not act, and so was deemed denied. On October 8, 2015, Ryffel Partnership filed its own Rule 59 Motion for new trial, or alternatively, amendment of the judgment. Ryffel Partnership contended that the jury\u2019s award of damages for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>unjust enrichment, coupled with a finding that both oral contracts were breached, constituted manifest legal error, since breach of contract and unjust enrichment are mutually exclusive theories of recovery. The District Court, acknowledging that breach of contract and unjust enrichment are incongruous findings in the same judgment, denied Ryffel Partnership\u2019s request for a new trial or elimination of the award, but amended the jury\u2019s verdict by assigning the $50,348.18 in damages awarded for unjust enrichment to the finding for breach of contract. The court also vacated the jury\u2019s award of $25,000 for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, as it would have been an impermissible double recovery for Alpine and unsupported by any evidence of additional damages suffered.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">\u00b618 Ryffel Partnership appeals, alleging that the District Court erred by denying the motion for a new trial and that the jury\u2019s verdict regarding the parties\u2019 second agreement was not supported by substantial evidence. Alpine asks this Court to affirm the District Court\u2019s denial of a new trial and cross-appeals, alleging that the trial court erred by denying Alpine\u2019s motion after trial for pre-judgment interest pursuant to \u00a7 27-1-211, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">\u00b619 This Court reviews a district court\u2019s order to grant or deny a new trial for manifest abuse of discretion. <em>Armstrong v.

The trial court found that this argument had merit because the award would be an impermissible double recovery for Alpine and, accordingly, granted Ryffel Partnership\u2019s request that the award be vacated. However, Ryffel Partnership never asserted that there was not substantial evidence supporting the jury\u2019s determination that Ryffel Partnership breached the second agreement, nor did it argue waiver or accord and satisfaction as defenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">\u00b624 We have cautioned litigants that this Court strongly recommends that challenges to a verdict\u2019s lack of evidence be first brought before the district court via post-trial motions, before reaching us on appeal. <em>D.R.

Although this policy is not a requirement in Montana, such post-trial motions \u201c \u2018serve as an appropriate first step for contesting an unfavorable verdict and ... it would be best to afford the trial court that opportunity to reevaluate its rulings.\u2019 \u201d <em>Four Beat, </em>\u00b6 46 (quoting <em>Stauffer Chemical Co. v.

We will not unfairly fault a trial court for failing to rule correctly on an issue that it was not asked to consider. <em>Becker, </em>\u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">\u00b625 We observe also that although Ryffel Partnership did raise a sufficiency of the evidence argument regarding the jury\u2019s damages award for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing in its Rule 59 motion, it never argued to the District Court that there was insufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s determination that there was a breach of the second agreement. We cannot conceive of how the issue framed to the trial court below\u2014a lack of substantial evidence to support a finding of a breach of good faith and fair dealing\u2014could be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>considered as a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict that the second agreement was breached by Ryffel Partnership.

An oral contract is enforceable if the four elements of a contractual agreement are met: (1) identifiable parties capable of contracting; (2) consent of those parties; (3) a lawful object; and (4) sufficient consideration. Section 28-2-102, <em>MCA; Keil v. Glacier Park, Inc., </em>188 Mont. 455, 460, 614 P.2d 502, 505 (1980). In making this determination, we must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party. <em>Lee v. Kane, </em>270 Mont. 505, 511, 893 P.2d 854, 857 (1995). The prevailing party is entitled to any reasonable inference that can be drawn from the facts. <em>Sandman v. Farmers Ins. Exc., </em>1998 MT 286, \u00b6 41, 291 Mont. 456, 969 P.2d 277.</p>\n<p id=\"Axk9\">\u00b6 27 Ryffel and Alpine are identifiable parties capable of contracting and testified that they reached an agreement when they met in September 2007. Further, logging and other construction work is a lawful object of a contract. Finally, Ryffel had trees on the property removed and thinned, in addition to other work being performed. Alpine received payment for its work. Thus, though the parties disputed its terms, there was sufficient evidence for the jury to find that all the elements of a contract existed. It was for the jury to weigh and resolve conflicts in the evidence, to judge the credibility of the witnesses, and to make factual determinations necessary to render a verdict. <em>Sandman, </em>\u00b6 45. The evidence presented to the jury, consisting of both testimony of the parties and exhibits, was sufficient to support its findings that Ryffel breached the second agreement and that Alpine was damaged.</p>\n<p id=\"A8C\">\u00b628  Ryffel Partnership also argues waiver or accord and satisfaction as a basis to reverse the jury\u2019s breach of contract determination respecting the second agreement. Ryffel Partnership <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>maintains it argued all along that by cashing the check for $45,000, Alpine agreed to the terms as represented therein. However, the jury heard evidence supporting an alternate interpretation of events. By Ryffel\u2019s own testimony, he believed the check for $45,000 was meant for the purchase of a line machine, not as satisfaction of all prior invoices. Further, Rammers\u2019 cell phone records showed that he had at least once attempted to contact Ryffel to discuss the letter. Shirley testified, too, that she attempted to contact Ryffel, but was only able to speak with his secretary. We find this evidence substantive enough for the jury to have found in favor of Alpine, and to have rejected the waiver, accord and satisfaction argument Ryffel Partnership now presents on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">\u00b629 <em>2.

R. Civ. P. 59(a)(1)(A). A verdict may be vacated and a new trial granted when an aggrieved party\u2019s substantial rights are affected by a verdict that is against the law. Section 25-ll-102(5)-(7), MCA. \u201cWhen a jury\u2019s verdict is logically impossible and simply cannot be reconciled with the evidence, argument and legal theories presented at trial, the constitutional rights of the litigants to a fair trial requires [sic] that a new trial be ordered.\u201d <em>Four Beat, </em>\u00b6 46. An irreconcilability of evidence, argument, and legal theory is rare, however, and will be found only in very limited circumstances. <em>Four Beat, </em>\u00b6 46.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">\u00b631 <em>Four Beat </em>exemplifies those infrequent circumstances. In <em>Four Beat, </em>Four Beat and Sierra\u2014parties who were seeking to develop prospects for the acquisition or development of oil and gas\u2014operated their venture in part based on a letter. <em>Four Beat, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 4-6. The jury found this letter did not constitute a contract between them. <em>Four Beat, </em>\u00b6 17. This finding should have defeated Four Beat\u2019s claim, which was \u201cpremised solely upon the assertion that the Letter constituted a <em>contract[.]\u201d Four Beat, </em>\u00b6 38. However, the jury also awarded Four Beat $2.5 million for Sierra\u2019s breach of the letter. <em>Four Beat, </em>\u00b6 17. Even though there was arguably sufficient evidence for the jury to conclude that Four Beat suffered those damages as a result of the events contemplated in the letter, Four Beat could have been entitled to the damages award only if the jury had also found the letter created a contractual obligation from Sierra to Four Beat. Since the jury had found the opposite, that no contract existed between them, we reversed and remanded for a new trial because we found the verdict to be inconsistent, logically impossible, and incapable of reconciliation with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>the evidence, argument, and legal theories presented at trial. <em>Four Beat, </em>\u00b6 46. In our analysis, we examined prior case law covering inconsistent verdicts: <em>Rudeck v. Wright, </em>218 Mont. 41, 46, 709 P.2d 621, 624 (1985) (affirming the District Court\u2019s granting of a new trial where the jury\u2019s verdict was totally inconsistent and contrary to the mandates of the law); <em>Abernathy v. Eline Oil Field Servs., Inc., </em>200 Mont. 205, 217, 650 P.2d 772, 779 (1982) (\u201cholding that when two conflicting verdicts are reached from the same evidence, a new trial is required\u201d); <em>Mont. Bank of Red Lodge, N.A. v. Lightfield, </em>237 Mont. 41, 49, 771 P.2d 571, 576-77 (1989) (affirming the district court\u2019s grant of a new trial when the jury findings were inconsistent and the court could not determine how the jury arrived at its conclusions). <em>Four Beat, </em>\u00b6 41. These cases provide a roadmap for when a court might be willing to either correct a jury\u2019s verdict, finding it otherwise consistent, or to reverse and remand for a new trial based upon irreconcilable inconsistencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">\u00b632 We have acknowledged certain grounds that will support a Rule 59 motion to alter or amend a judgment\u2014one of which is to correct manifest errors of law or fact upon which the judgment is based. <em>Nelson v. Driscoll, </em>285 Mont. 355, 360, 948 P.2d 256, 259 (1997) (citing 11 Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller and Mary Kay Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 2810.1 (1995)). We note here also that, under Montana law, the equitable remedy of unjust enrichment is unavailable where there is a legal contract between the parties. <em>Maxted v. Barrett, </em>198 Mont. 81, 87, 643 P.2d 1161, 1164 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"AN3K\">\u00b633  In its Rule 59 Motion, Ryffel Partnership correctly argued that the jury\u2019s simultaneous finding that Ryffel Partnership had breached two contracts with Alpine, while also being unjustly enriched by Alpine\u2019s labor, was legally inconsistent. Here, however, the record reflects that the District Court was able to reconcile the jury\u2019s findings with established law by reassigning the jury\u2019s finding of damages from unjust enrichment to breach of contract, while still maintaining the integrity of the jury\u2019s verdict. Unlike in <em>Four Beat, </em>where no alternative remedial theory for recovery such as unjust enrichment was advanced, here, the special verdict form proposed two alternatives for recovery: breach of contract or unjust enrichment. Although unjust enrichment is only available in the absence of a contract, the jury found that a contract existed; that Ryffel had breached that contract; that the breach caused Alpine no damages; but that Alpine suffered damages in the amount of $50,348.18 as a result of Ryffel\u2019s unjust enrichment. It was not difficult for the trial court, and it is not difficult <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>for us, to discern how the jury arrived at its conclusions and to correct the verdict\u2019s inconsistency: (1) Alpine\u2019s books as of 2008 accurately reflected the total of what Ryffel Partnership owed, that being $50,348.18; (2) that amount constituted the sum total of damages to Alpine arising out of the obligations created by the agreements between the parties; and (3) Ryffel Partnership was either the breaching party, or the party unjustly enriched. The verdict was therefore reconcilable with the evidence presented at trial and may be corrected without compromising its integrity. As such, we cannot conclude that the trial court abused its discretion by amending the verdict and denying Ryffel Partnership\u2019s request for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">\u00b634 <em>3. Whether the District Court erred in denying Alpine\u2019s motion for pre-judgment interest pursuant to \u00a7 27-1-211, MCA.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">\u00b635 When a prevailing plaintiffs amount of recovery is capable of being made certain by calculation, that plaintiff is entitled to prejudgment interest under \u00a7 27-1-211, MCA. <em>Mont. Petroleum Tank Release Comp. Bd. v. Crumleys, Inc., </em>2008 MT 2, \u00b6 99, 341 Mont. 33, 55, 174 P.3d 948, 965. There are three requirements under the statute: (1) an underlying monetary obligation must exist; (2) the amount of recovery must be capable of being made certain; and (3) the right to recover must vest on a particular day. <em>Petroleum </em>Tank, \u00b6 99 (citing <em>Albers v. Bar ZF Ranch, Inc., </em>229 Mont. 396, 408, 747 P.2d 1347, 1354 (1987)). When the damages at issue are uncertain or disputed, an award of prejudgment interest is inappropriate. <em>Petroleum Tank, </em>\u00b6 99 (citing <em>Northern Montana Hosp. v. Knight, </em>248 Mont. 310, 320, 811 P.2d 1276, 1282 (1991)). \u201c[N]o interest can run until a fixed amount of damages has been arrived at, either by agreement, appraisal, or judgment.\u201d <em>Northern Montana Hosp., </em>248 Mont. at 321, 811 P.2d at 1282 (quoting <em>Carriger v. Ballenger, </em>192 Mont. 479, 486, 628 P.2d 1106, 1110 (1981)).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">\u00b636 In <em>Petroleum Tank, </em>we found that certain administrative costs relating to an environmental cleanup and incurred by an insured as the result of an insurer\u2019s breach of the duty to indemnify, should be considered consequential damages because they were contemplated by both parties at the time the insurance contract was entered into and would be the natural result of a refusal to indemnify. The terms of the policy were broad and did not qualify or limit what would be construed as an expense under the policy. Nonetheless, the policy contemplated that administrative costs incurred from a clean-up would be covered. <em>Petroleum Tank, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 68-71. We held that the insured was not entitled to prejudgment interest because the amount of damages to which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>insured was entitled was not conclusively determined until the date the jury returned the verdict. <em>Petroleum Tank, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 100-01.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">\u00b637 In <em>Northern Montana Hospital, </em>the hospital sought recovery from an architect for damages it incurred as the result of design defects and code violations in its newly constructed facility. <em>Northern Montana Hosp., </em>248 Mont. at 313, 811 P.2d at 1278. The hospital presented ample evidence as to its damages, resulting in a jury award of <em>$1,750,000. Northern Montana Hosp., </em>248 Mont. at 314, 321, 881 P.2d at 1278, 1282. However, the jury\u2019s award did not comport with any amount claimed by the hospital at trial. <em>Northern Montana Hosp., </em>248 Mont. at 321, 881 P.2d at 1282. We concluded that the amount awarded could not have vested until the date of the jury\u2019s verdict, and therefore affirmed the District Court\u2019s denial of prejudgment interest. <em>Northern Montana Hosp., </em>248 Mont. at 321, 881 P.2d at 1282.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">\u00b638 Similar to both <em>Northern Montana Hospital </em>and <em>Petroleum Tank, </em>the amount to which Alpine was entitled was not conclusively determined until the date the jury returned the verdict. Unlike in <em>Petroleum Tank, </em>here, the terms of the agreement between the parties were premised upon oral contracts, one of which comprised solely of a conversation between the parties. In <em>Petroleum Tank, </em>the contract at least contemplated through its terms the issues and damages raised in the suit. Here, the terms resulting from the oral agreements were cursory and the parties disputed each other\u2019s recollection of the meetings and the concomitant terms of agreement. As a result, the record shows it is unclear, at best, whether hauling charges to the mill should have been applied to Ryffel Partnership\u2019s running balance, and if Alpine was to be billing an hourly rate for logging work instead of a fee for the job. Further, Ryffel disputed that the check for $45,000 enclosed with his letter should have been applied to invoices\u2014he believed it should have been used to purchase equipment. Those terms were disputed at trial, but each was supported with credible testimony. As a result, the jury could have reasonably determined any number of sums as an appropriate award for Alpine. Similar to <em>Northern Montana Hospital, </em>the jury was in no way bound by a particular amount and could have decided on nearly any award beyond or below that claimed by Alpine.</p>\n<p id=\"Aep\">\u00b639  Although the District Court denied Alpine\u2019s motion for prejudgment interest by inaction, we do not disagree with the result. Uncertainty over the terms of the agreement and damages meant that the amount of Alpine\u2019s recovery was not certain or capable of being made certain by calculation. Alpine\u2019s claim for prejudgment interest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>thus fails to meet the requirements of \u00a7 27-1-211, MCA, and we affirm denial of the motion below accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">\u00b640 The judgment of the District Court and its order entered pursuant to M.
