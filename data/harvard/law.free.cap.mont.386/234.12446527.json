We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-10\">\u00b62 We restate the issue on appeal as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-11\"><em>Did the District Court err in appointing Lloyd, rather than Robert, as full guardian for M.D. </em>?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b259-13\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b259-14\">\u00b63 M.D. is a seventy-six-year-old woman who suffers from Alzheimer\u2019s disease and dementia. She was married to Kenneth Domonoske (Kenneth) until his death in 2015 and they have four adult sons: Lloyd, Robert, Brad, and Doug. Kenneth and M.D. have owned a family farm outside of Plentywood, Montana, since 1958. Prior to his father\u2019s death, Lloyd, who also lives in Plentywood, cared for both of his parents, taking them to doctor\u2019s appointments, cooking their meals, picking up their prescriptions, and helping with all aspects of their personal care.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-15\">\u00b64 Lloyd has also taken an active role in maintaining the family farm. Kenneth and M.D. previously struggled to keep the farm afloat, filing for bankruptcy twice. Both Lloyd and his brother Brad expended personal funds to keep the farm operating and, since 2000, Lloyd has helped to work the farm. Lloyd also co-signed a loan with his parents to refinance the debt his parents had incurred on the property. In 2009, Kenneth and M.D. set up a $21,544.10 annual cash lease with Lloyd for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>742.8 tillable acres on the farm. The lease payment Lloyd makes to M.D. is used to pay the farm loan. Additionally, Lloyd, Kenneth, and M.D. have always each owned a few head of cattle and Lloyd has cared for all the cattle on the farm.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">\u00b65 On October 21, 2015, just before Kenneth\u2019s death, Lloyd filed a Petition for Appointment of Full Guardian, requesting that he be appointed guardian of M.D. due to her inability to write checks and manage her own affairs. Shortly after his father\u2019s death, Lloyd moved to the family farm to take care of M.D.\u2019s personal needs. Lloyd also manages the benefits she is entitled to receive from the Social Security Administration and the Department of Defense. Initially, Robert, Brad, and Doug signed consents for Lloyd to serve as M.D\u2019s guardian. After the death of their father, Robert and Doug revoked their consents and opposed Lloyd\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">\u00b66 In April 2016, Lloyd placed M.D. in the Sheridan Memorial Nursing Home so he could dedicate more time to the calving and farming operations. The nursing home is one block away from Lloyd\u2019s house and both he and his wife Patti Domonoske visit M.D. on a daily basis. On April 12, 2016, the District Court held a hearing, taking testimony and receiving exhibits on the petition. Brad testified in support of Lloyd\u2019s petition, in part based upon a recent trip he made to visit M.D. in the nursing home. He testified in support of her placement there because the facility is located in M.D.\u2019s hometown and many of the residents and staff know her.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">\u00b67 Robert and Doug, on the other hand, asked the court to appoint Robert as guardian for M.D. Robert lives in Wilton, North Dakota, and works as an over-the-road trucker. He testified that he is on the road approximately 265 days per year. As of the date of the District Court hearing, he had not visited M.D. for six months and had not personally assessed the quality of care she was receiving in the nursing home. Nonetheless, Robert testified that he planned to place M.D. in afacility in Mandan, North Dakota, maintaining that its memory care unit would best suit her needs. No medical testimony was offered to support Robert\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">\u00b68 On May 24, 2016, the District Court entered its Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order, finding M.D. to be an incapacitated person pursuant to \u00a7 72-5-101(1), MCA,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and in need of a full guardian. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>The court further found that it was in M.D.\u2019s best interest that Lloyd be appointed as her guardian. Robert filed a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">\u00b69 This Court reviews a district court\u2019s appointment of a guardian and determination of the scope of the guardian\u2019s responsibilities for an abuse of discretion. <em>In re Estate of West, </em>269 Mont. 83, 91, 887 P.2d 222, 227 (1994). We exercise de novo review to determine whether the court correctly interpreted and applied the relevant statutes. <em>In re Mental Health of E.P.B., </em>2007 MT 224, \u00b6 5, 339 Mont. 107, 168 P.3d 662. We will not disturb the findings supporting a district court\u2019s determination unless they are clearly erroneous. <em>In re Guardianship &amp; Conservatorship of Gilroy, </em>2004 MT 267, \u00b6 16, 323 Mont. 149, 99 P.3d 205.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">\u00b610 <em>Did the District Court err in appointing Lloyd, rather than Robert, as full guardian for M.D. </em>?</p>\n<p id=\"b261-9\">\u00b611 In this case, the parties do not challenge the District Court\u2019s finding that M.D. is an incapacitated person. We will therefore limit our review to whether the court abused its discretion and acted in accordance with \u00a7 72-5-312, MCA, in appointing Lloyd, rather than Robert, as full guardian.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-10\">\u00b612 Under \u00a7 72-5-312(1), MCA, \u201cAny competent person ... may be appointed guardian of an incapacitated person.\u201d However, a person is ineligible to serve as guardian if the person:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-11\">(a) provides or is likely to provide during the guardianship substantial services to the incapacitated person in the professional or business capacity other than in the capacity of guardian;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-12\">(b) is or is likely to become during the guardianship period a creditor of the incapacitated person, other than in the capacity of guardian; [or]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-13\">(c) has or is likely to have during the guardianship period interests that may conflict with those of the incapacitated person</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAIG\">\n<img class=\"blockquote\" height=\"18\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAADYAAAASAQAAAAA4AxBQAAAAPElEQVR4nGP8z8DAwMDwl4kBAsimfzJM+MSgwMDwoZ79wT/+PzBxhh//+z/+l//D8Pf//d//9/9hJGAfAPRLFzCF+flNAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC\" width=\"54\"/>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b261-14\">Section 72-5-312(4)(a)-(c), MCA. When interpreting a statute, \u201cwe seek <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>to implement the objectives the Legislature sought to achieve, and if the legislative intent can be determined from the plain language of the statute, the plain language controls.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Montanans v. State, </em>2006 MT 277, \u00b6 60, 334 Mont. 237, 146 P.3d 759 (citing <em>City of Billings v. Gonzales, </em>2006 MT 24, \u00b6 8, 331 Mont. 71, 128 P.3d 1014).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-5\">Subsection (a): Whether the District Court erred in finding that Lloyd does not provide and is not likely to provide substantial services to M.D. in a business capacity outside of his guardianship capacity</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">\u00b613 Robert first argues that the District Court acted in contravention of \u00a7 72-5-312(4)(a), MCA, and erred in appointing Lloyd as M.D.\u2019s guardian because he provides or is likely to provide substantial services to M.D. due to his business interest in, and management of, the family farm. As evidence, Robert points to Lloyd\u2019s cash lease on part of the farm\u2019s tillable acres, his husbandry of M.D.\u2019s cattle, and the farm loan Lloyd co-signed with M.D. and Kenneth. Lloyd argues that he has undertaken these actions for the benefit of the family farm, not to profit from, or provide substantial services to, M.D.</p>\n<p id=\"A-D\">\u00b614  Our case law has not interpreted the \u201csubstantial services\u201d provision contained in \u00a7 72-5-312(4)(a), MCA. Thus, Robert\u2019s challenge to the District Court\u2019s order raises a matter of first impression before this Court. None of the terms contained in \u00a7 72-5-312(4)(a), MCA, are defined in Title 72, chapter 5, MCA, or in any other title of the Montana Code Annotated. However, we have previously held that, under a plain language interpretation of \u00a7 72-5-312(4), MCA, \u201c[slubsection 4 anticipates potential conflicts of interest between identified guardian types and the incapacitated person, thereby prohibiting appointments of such guardians.\u201d <em>In re Co-Guardianship of D.A., </em>2004 MT 302, \u00b6 19, 323 Mont. 442, 100 P.3d 650. The aim of the statute is to protect an incapacitated person from commercial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>relationships that can cause harm to the person. Accordingly, we extend our plain language interpretation to the provision in question and hold that \u00a7 72-5-312(4)(a), MCA, requires a court to disqualify a person engaged in a business or professional relationship with an incapacitated person when that relationship is likely to harm the interests of the incapacitated person.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">\u00b615 In this case, the District Court found that \u00a7 72-5-312(4)(a), MCA, only applies to nursing homes or health care providers who are taking care of incapacitated persons for a fee.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> While we will not interpret the statute so narrowly, we also decline to interpret the statute so broadly as to disqualify a family member from serving as a guardian just because both have an interest in a family business. We recognize that business and familial relationships inherently become inextricably intertwined when family members engage in a business together. Indeed, in the case of generational ranching and farming families, it would be a rare case if no business was conducted among family members. The fact that they do should not preemptively prohibit them from serving as guardians for one another and we conclude that the statute does not have this effect. If we were to automatically disqualify a family member from serving as a guardian solely on this basis, it could harm both family businesses and those persons deemed incapacitated, and in need of a guardian, in Montana. In many cases, a court would be forced to disqualify family members who know the most about an incapacitated person\u2019s finances, assets, and personal needs.</p>\n<p id=\"atx-dedup-1\">\u00b616  Upon review, we conclude that the District Court did not err in determining that Lloyd is not providing, nor is he likely to provide, substantial services to M.D. in a business capacity. First, there is no evidence to suggest that Lloyd\u2019s management of the family farm presents a conflict of interest with respect to M.D.; rather, the steps Lloyd has taken to manage the family farm serves to benefit M.D. Second, even if a potential conflict exists by way of Lloyd\u2019s management and interests in the family farm, we cannot say on the record before us that such a conflict is or is likely to be substantial. However, if future developments create such a conflict between Lloyd and M.D. because Lloyd begins to manage the family farm to advance his own interests to the detriment of M.D.\u2019s interests, then a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>reevaluation of Lloyd\u2019s continued eligibility as guardian may be required under those circumstances. Finally, while we acknowledge, as noted above, the District Court\u2019s erroneous legal analysis in this case, we also \u201cwill not reverse a district court that reaches the correct result, even if for the wrong reason.\u201d <em>Pumphrey v. Empire Lath &amp; Plaster, </em>2006 MT 99, \u00b6 37, 332 Mont. 116, 135 P.3d 797.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-5\">Subsection (b): Whether the District Court erred in finding that Lloyd is not and is not likely to become a creditor of M.D. outside of his guardianship capacity</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A6X4\">\u00b617 Robert next argues that Lloyd is or is likely to become a creditor of M.D., and is thus ineligible to serve as M.D.\u2019s guardian under \u00a7 72-5-312(4)(b), MCA, because he: 1) co-signed a loan with M.D. to refinance the farm\u2019s debt; 2) pays for M.D.\u2019s nursing home care out of his own personal banking account; and 3) has invested personal funds in the farm. Lloyd argues that because M.D. does not owe him any money, and will never borrow money from him given the advanced state of her disease, he is not and will not become a creditor of M.D.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">\u00b618 While the term \u201ccreditor\u201d is not defined in Title 72 of the Montana Code Annotated, the term as used in this section of the code can be ascertained by looking to other sections of the code. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1-2-107, MCA (\u201cWhenever the meaning of a word or phrase is defined in any part of this code, such definition is applicable to the same word or phrase wherever it occurs, except where a contrary intention plainly appears.\u201d). Under \u00a7 31-2-102, MCA, a creditor is defined as \u201ca person in whose favor an obligation exists, by reason of which the person is or may become entitled to the payment of money.\u201d Again, in addition to considering whether a creditor-debtor relationship exists or is likely to develop between a guardian and an incapacitated person, we must also consider whether this relationship presents a conflict of interest that precludes a guardian from acting in the incapacitated person\u2019s best interest.</p>\n<p id=\"AHEy\">\u00b619  Here, we conclude that the District Court did not err when it determined that \u00a7 72-5-312(4)(b), MCA, did not disqualify Lloyd from serving as M.D.\u2019s guardian. Robert presented no evidence to support his contention that M.D. owes or will owe Lloyd any money. There is no agreement between Lloyd and M.D. which requires Lloyd to be reimbursed for his investment in the farm or his payments towards his mother\u2019s care. Indeed, if anything, M.D. may become a creditor of Lloyd if he fails to make payments on the annual cash lease on the farm. And, if he defaults on his lease payments, <em>both </em>M.D. and Lloyd\u2019s interests would suffer because the income used to pay the farm loan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>would disappear and the loan would go into default. Based on the evidence presented to the District Court, we conclude that the court did not err in determining that Lloyd is not likely to become a creditor of M.D.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-5\">Subsection (c): Whether the District Court erred in finding that Lloyd has not and is not likely to have interests that conflict with M.D.\u2019s interests</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">\u00b620 Robert also argues that Lloyd has or is likely to have interests that may conflict with M.D. In addition to reiterating many of same points already addressed above, he generally maintains that Lloyd\u2019s interest in maintaining the family farm presents a conflict of interest that precludes him from acting as M.D.\u2019s guardian. Lloyd argues that his interests are not in conflict, but rather are aligned, with M.D.\u2019s interests and that Robert\u2019s claim that a conflict may arise is speculative and unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"aeh-dedup-2\">\u00b621  Section 72-5-312(4)(c), MCA, is a catch-all provision which contemplates other types of conflicts that would preclude a person from serving as a guardian of an incapacitated person. <em>See In re Guardianship of Nelson, </em>204 Mont. 90, 95-96, 663 P.2d 316, 318-19 (1983). As such, because we have already addressed many of the arguments Robert reiterates here, we will only address his general claim that Lloyd\u2019s \u201cinterests as a farmer and his desire to continue with the family farm\u201d present a conflict of interest that disqualifies him from serving as M.D.\u2019s guardian. Upon review, we agree with the District Court\u2019s determination that \u00a7 72-5-312(4)(c), MCA, does not apply in this case. By maintaining and working the family farm, Lloyd\u2019s investment of time and money into the family business serves M.D.\u2019s interests and does not conflict with them.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">\u00b622 Finally, Robert contends that the District Court abused its discretion in not appointing him as guardian because M.D.\u2019s interests are best served by placing her in a nursing home in Mandan, North Dakota, which would provide her with the care she needs. Lloyd, on the other hand, argues that he is the best person to serve as M.D.\u2019s guardian, based on his prior role as her caregiver. He also argues that Robert\u2019s plan to place M.D. in a nursinghome where she knows no one, without expert testimony supporting his claim, is not in M.D.\u2019s best interest.</p>\n<p id=\"a7c-dedup-0\">\u00b623  Here, pursuant to \u00a7 72-5-312, MCA, the District Court considered the testimony and exhibits offered into evidence and exercised its broad discretion to determine that Lloyd was the best qualified to serve as M.D.\u2019s guardian. We find no abuse of discretion-in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>the court\u2019s determination. Therefore, we affirm the District Court\u2019s appointment of Lloyd as full guardian for M.D.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">\u00b624 For the foregoing reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<judges id=\"b266-7\">JUSTICES McKINNON, SHEA, BAKER and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b260-9\"> Under \u00a7 72-5-101(1), MCA, \u201c \u2018Incapacitated person\u2019 means any person who is impaired by reason of mental illness, mental deficiency, physical illness or disability, chronic use of drugs, chronic intoxication, or other cause, except minority, to the extent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>that the person lacks sufficient understanding or capacity to make or communicate responsible decisions concerning the person or which cause has so impaired the person\u2019s judgment that the person is incapable of realizing and making a rational decision with respect to the person\u2019s need for treatment.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b262-8\"> We also note that, in this case, the District Court interpreted \u00a7 72-5-312(4), MCA, in part by relying on the Commissioners\u2019 Comments accompanying the Uniform Probate Code (UPC). In the past, this Court has also relied on the UPC comments when interpreting statutes based on that code. <em>See In re Estate of Lettengarver, </em>249 Mont. 92, 99, 813 P.2d 468, 473 (1991). Montana adopted the UPC in 1974, including the provisions currently contained in \u00a7 72-5-312, MCA, that delineate who maybe appointed guardian of an incapacitated person. Section 91A-5-311, MCA (1974). However, subsection (4) of the statute is not the progeny of the UPC; rather, the Montana Legislature adopted the subsection in 1981. <em>See </em>Unif. Probate Code \u00a7 5-311 (1977); 1981 Mont. Laws 550 (codified at \u00a7 72-5-312, MCA (1981)). As such, the UPC comments do not provide a basis to interpret the language of \u00a7 72-5-312(4)(a)-(c), MCA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b263-7\"> We note that the District Court relied on the Commissioners\u2019 Comments accompanying the UPC to come to this conclusion.
