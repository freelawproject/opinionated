We affirm and restate the issue on appeal.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-24\">\n<em>Did the District Court err by denying Stewart\u2019s speedy trial </em>\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>\n<em>motion?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">\u00b62 After leading officers on a high-speed chase, Stewart was arrested on August 3,2013, in Yellowstone County, and charged with Criminal Endangerment, Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol or Drugs, Operation of a Motor Vehicle by a Person with Alcohol Concentration of 0.08% or more, Fleeing from or Eluding a Peace Officer, and Driving While Privilege to do so is Suspended or Revoked. He posted bond on August 6, 2013, and was released.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">\u00b63 Nine days later, Stewart was arrested on a warrant issued by Silver Bow County, where he was charged with Partner or Family Member Assault (PFMA). Stewart could not obtain bail, and was detained in the Butte-Silver Bow Detention Center during that proceeding. Thus, Stewart\u2019s Silver Bow County case proceeded simultaneously with his Yellowstone County case. The timelines of these two cases intersect and, while this appeal concerns the Yellowstone County case, it is necessary to consider relevant events from both cases.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The table below summarizes the key events in both cases leading to his motion to dismiss his Yellowstone County charges for lack of speedy trial:</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">Date County</p>\n<p id=\"A0t\">Aug. 3, 2013 Yellowstone</p>\n<p id=\"a1c-dedup-0\">Aug. 6, 2013 Yellowstone</p>\n<p id=\"AbTg\">Aug. 15, 2013 Yellowstone</p>\n<p id=\"AD_\">(9:35 am)</p>\n<p id=\"Ax6\">Aug. 15, 2013 Silver Bow</p>\n<p id=\"A10\">(8:12 pm)</p>\n<p id=\"AF8Z\">Aug. 15, 2013-Silver Bow</p>\n<p id=\"AYS\">Jan. 8, 2014</p>\n<p id=\"b340-9\">Event/Action</p>\n<p id=\"b340-10\">Stewart arrested in Yellowstone County</p>\n<p id=\"b340-11\">Stewart released on bond</p>\n<p id=\"AoA\">Stewart arraigned; Plead not guilty; First trial date set for Feb. 12,2014</p>\n<p id=\"b340-12\">Stewart arrested on Silver Bow County warrant for PFMA</p>\n<p id=\"Aa-T\">Detained in Butte-Silver Bow County Detention Center; Charged; Arraigned; Trial set for Jan. 21, 2014; Denial of Motion to be Released on Own</p>\n<p id=\"b341-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>Jan. 8, 2014 Silver Bow</p>\n<p id=\"AAd\">Jan. 23, 2014 Silver Bow</p>\n<p id=\"acp-dedup-1\">Jan. 23, 2014-Silver Bow</p>\n<p id=\"Aanv\">Nov. 19, 2015</p>\n<p id=\"AIa\">Jan. 27, 2014 Yellowstone</p>\n<p id=\"APsB\">Jan. 31, 2014 Yellowstone</p>\n<p id=\"Ata\">Jan. 31, 2014 Yellowstone</p>\n<p id=\"aqy-dedup-0\">May 6, 2014 Yellowstone</p>\n<p id=\"Au2\">May 16, 2014 Yellowstone</p>\n<p id=\"apr-dedup-0\">May 30, 2014 Yellowstone</p>\n<p id=\"A3E\">Sept. 3-5, 2014 Yellowstone</p>\n<p id=\"AxPa\">Nov. 7, 2014 Yellowstone</p>\n<p id=\"AG0\">Nov. 7, 2014 Yellowstone</p>\n<p id=\"A3Ex\">Nov. 13, 2014 Yellowstone</p>\n<p id=\"A8-m\">Jan. 22, 2015 Yellowstone</p>\n<p id=\"ADW\">Mar. 3, 2015 Yellowstone</p>\n<p id=\"A8S\">Recognizance; Omnibus hearing Letter from Stewart complaining about his public defender and complementing Yellowstone County on efficiently handling his case there</p>\n<p id=\"AqZ\">Stewart enters guilty plea to PFMA (would later move to withdraw this plea)</p>\n<p id=\"A6f\">Before sentencing occurred on Nov. 19, 2015, Stewart filed numerous pleadings regarding withdrawal of his guilty plea, habeas corpus, and complaints about counsel</p>\n<p id=\"api-dedup-1\">Stewart files Motion to Continue Trial</p>\n<p id=\"A6xM\">Stewart files Waiver of Speedy Trial</p>\n<p id=\"AkTr\">Order Resetting Trial for May 5, 2014</p>\n<p id=\"acq-dedup-1\">Stewart files Motion to Continue Trial</p>\n<p id=\"AlzU\">Stewart files Waiver of Speedy Trial</p>\n<p id=\"AATy\">Order Resetting Trial for Sept. 16,2014</p>\n<p id=\"AZ2D\">State and Stewart file separate Status Reports requesting a jury not be assembled</p>\n<p id=\"AnUF\">State files Motion to Transfer Defendant</p>\n<p id=\"AEj\">Order Granting State\u2019s Motion to Transfer Defendant</p>\n<p id=\"azi-dedup-0\">Order Resetting Trial for Mar. 2, 2015</p>\n<p id=\"A1ji\">Stewart files Motion for Substitution of Judge, granted</p>\n<p id=\"A1Ck\">Order Resetting Trial for Apr. 20, 2015</p>\n<p id=\"b342-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>Mar. 12, 2015 Yellowstone</p>\n<p id=\"a6h-dedup-0\">Mar. 17, 2015 Yellowstone</p>\n<p id=\"AyA\">Mar. 27, 2015 Yellowstone</p>\n<p id=\"A0Q\">Mar. 30, 2015 Yellowstone</p>\n<p id=\"A3u\">Apr. 13, 2015 Yellowstone</p>\n<p id=\"ate-dedup-0\">Apr. 17, 2015 Yellowstone</p>\n<p id=\"Ax4\">Apr. 20-21, 2015 Yellowstone</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">Stewart files Speedy Trial motion</p>\n<p id=\"A_iO\">Stewart writes complaining of counsel; Order Setting <em>Finley </em>Hearing for Apr. 6, 2015</p>\n<p id=\"AMGK\">Extension of time granted until Apr. 7, 2015</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">Order Resetting Hearing for Apr. 13,2015</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\"><em>Finley </em>Hearing held; Stewart stated he was satisfied with counsel</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">Order denying Stewart\u2019s speedy trial motion</p>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">Jury trial; Stewart found guilty of two charges</p>\n<p id=\"b342-9\">\u00b64 In response to Stewart\u2019s speedy trial motion, the Yellowstone County District Court determined that the Yellowstone County proceeding began on August 3,2013, when Stewart was arrested, and ended for purposes of the speedy trial clock on April 20, 2015, when Stewart\u2019s Yellowstone County trial commenced. The District Court thus determined that a total of 626<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> days had passed between the two dates, which the District Court divided and attributed as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b342-10\">Beginning Ending Length Party Responsible Event, Date Event, Date of Delay for Delay and Reason for Delay</p>\n<p id=\"ALsx\">Arrest First trial date 194<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> State</p>\n<p id=\"aue-dedup-0\">Aug. 3, 2013 Feb. 12, 2014 Institutional delay</p>\n<p id=\"An_\">First trial date Second trial 82 Defendant</p>\n<p id=\"A54\">Feb.12,2014 date May 5, 2014 Waiver of speedy trial</p>\n<p id=\"AEi1\">Second trial date Third trial 134 Defendant May 5, 2014 date Waiver of speedy trial</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>Sept. 16, 2014</p>\n<p id=\"ahl-dedup-1\">Third trial date Fourth trial 167 Defendant</p>\n<p id=\"amy-dedup-0\">Sept. 16, 2014 date Mar. 2, 2015 Indicated he would change plea; Filed Status Report requesting that a jury not be assembled; Motion for Substitution of Judge</p>\n<p id=\"ah0-dedup-0\">Fourth trial date Fifth trial date Mar. 2, 2015 Apr. 20, 2015 49 State Institutional delay</p>\n<p id=\"b343-13\">The District Court found the State responsible for 243 days of delay and Stewart responsible for 383 days of delay. The District Court determined that Stewart had not been prejudiced by the delay, and held that Stewart had not been denied his constitutional right to a speedy trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-14\">\u00b65 Stewart appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-15\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b343-16\">\u00b66 A speedy trial violation presents a question of constitutional law, which we review <em>de novo </em>to determine whether the court correctly interpreted and applied the law. <em>State v. Butterfly, </em>2016 MT 195, \u00b6 6, 384 Mont. 287, 377 P.3d 1191 (citing State <em>v. Zimmerman, </em>2014 MT 173, \u00b6 11, 375 Mont. 374, 328 P.3d 1132). We review the factual findings underlying a speedy trial analysis for clear error. <em>State v. Morsette, </em>2013 MT 270, \u00b6 12, 372 Mont. 38, 309 P.3d 978 (citing <em>State v. Ariegwe, </em>2007 MT 204, \u00b6 119, 338 Mont. 442, 167 P.3d 815).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-17\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b343-18\">\u00b67 <em>Did the District Court err in denying Stewart\u2019s speedy trial motion?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b343-19\">\u00b68 The right to a speedy trial is guaranteed by the United States Constitution and the Montana Constitution. Reviewing courts must analyze speedy trial motions by balancing four factors: (1) the length of the delay; (2) the reason for the delay; (3) the accused\u2019s assertion of his right to a speedy trial; and (4) the prejudice to the accused as a result of the delay. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 20. No single factor is dispositive and each must be considered under the totality of the relevant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>circumstances. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 112. The delay threshold to trigger a speedy trial analysis is 200 days. <em>Arigewe, </em>\u00b6 41. Here the total length of delay was 625 days, making a speedy trial analysis necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">Factor One: The Length of the Delay</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">\u00b69 There is no dispute that the length of delay was 625 days. The length of the delay extended 425 days beyond the 200-day threshold.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">Factor Two: The Reason for the Delay</p>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">\u00b610 Under <em>Ariegwe\u2019s </em>second factor, the causes of the delay are considered. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 113. Delays are divided into periods of time and attributed to the appropriate party. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 113. Further, we assign weight to the period based on the specific cause and motive for the delay. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 67. Because \u201c[t]he prosecution bears the burden of explaining pretrial delays[,]\u201d <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 113, the longer the delay extends beyond the 200-day threshold, the more weight we assign to the State. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 49. However, any added weight assigned to the State does not relieve the defendant from providing evidence of prejudice. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 51. Finally, a valid reason for the delay is assigned less weight than other causes of delay. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 70.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-9\">\u00b611 Stewart does not contest the District Court\u2019s assignment of the 193 days between his arrest and the first trial date, and the 49 days between the fourth trial date and his trial to the State. Additionally, Stewart concedes that the 82 days between the first trial date and second trial date, and the 134 days between the second trial date and the third trial date, totaling 216 days, were appropriately assigned to him by the District Court because he twice sought continuances of these trial dates and waived his right to a speedy trial. However, Stewart asks that the circumstances contributing to his continuances and waivers be considered and that less weight be assigned to those 216 days because he \u201cactively sought his transportation to Billings during this time period but was stymied.\u201d However, the circumstances giving rise to Stewart\u2019s continuance requests were Stewart\u2019s decisions for which Yellowstone County bore no responsibility. These periods clearly weigh heavily against Stewart\u2019s position in the overall analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-10\">\u00b612 The parties\u2019 primary disagreement under factor two is the 167-day delay between the third and fourth trial dates. Stewart argues that, because the State is responsible for bringing a defendant to trial, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>it should be assigned these days. During this period, both Stewart and the State filed Status Reports asking that the District Court \u201cnot assemble a jury.\u201d Stewart\u2019s report further advised the District Court that \u201ca change of plea has occurred or is scheduled.\u201d He also explained that the \u201cDefendant is in Butte jail on other charges\u2014Defense and Prosecution are seeking to have Defendant appear via transport or video for COP [(change of plea)] hearing.\u201d From the record it appears that both sides were working together to arrange Stewart\u2019s appearance by video to change his plea. However, these efforts failed. In the order resetting the trial for March 2, 2016, the District Court cited Stewart\u2019s Status Report as the reason the \u201ctrial date of September 16th, 2014[,] had passed with no resolution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">\u00b613 Delays during this period were occasioned by Stewart\u2019s representations regarding an intention to enter a plea and to arrange an appearance. However, the State must not lose sight of its responsibility to bring a matter to trial, even when an apparently cooperative defendant seeks delay of the trial for purposes of entering a plea. While much of the delay in this period is Stewart\u2019s responsibility, the State also bears some responsibility for allowing time to elapse before filing a motion, in November 2014, to transfer Stewart. Of course, Stewart then responded, not by entering a plea, but by moving to substitute the judge, filing complaints against his attorney, and proceeding to trial. Given Stewart\u2019s actions, he bears primary responsibility for the delay during this period.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">Factor Three: The Accused Response to the Delay</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">\u00b614 Factor three \u201cserves as an indicator of whether the accused actually wanted a speedy trial.\u201d <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 84. We take an integrated approach and must evaluate the \u201csurrounding circumstances\u201d to determine \u201cthe accused\u2019s various responses to the delays.\u201d <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 85. \u201c[CJonduct demonstrating a desire to avoid trial weighs against the accused in the overall balancing.\u201d <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 85; <em>State v. Reynolds, </em>2017 MT 25, \u00b6 29, 386 Mont. 267, 389 P.3d 243 (under factor three, defendant \u201cdeliberately avoided apprehension and indicated no interest at all in having a speedy trial\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">\u00b615 Stewart twice waived his right to a speedy trial, filed a status report requesting that a jury not be assembled, gave assurances of his intent to enter a guilty plea, then moved for substitution of the judge, and made complaints about his attorney, which resulted in an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>unnecessary<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Finley </em>hearing. This factor weighs heavily against Stewart.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">Factor Four: Prejudice to the Accused</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">\u00b616 Under factor four, we determine if the accused has been prejudiced by the delay. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 86. \u201c[T]he speedy trial guarantee \u2018does not purport to protect a defendant from <em>all </em>[of the] effects flowing from a delay before trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 86 (emphasis in original) (quoting <em>United States v. Loud Hawk, </em>474 U.S. 302, 311, 106 S. Ct. 648, 654 (1985)). According to our speedy trial analysis there are three key factors to consider: (1) the nature of the incarceration; (2) the amount of disruption the incarceration has caused to the accused\u2019s life; (3) the accused\u2019s ability to present an effective defense. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 113. Of these three factors, the accused\u2019s ability to present an effective defense is the most important. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 98.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">\u00b617 Stewart and the State agree that his ability to present an effective defense was not prejudiced by his incarceration or by the delay. Instead, Stewart argues that his incarceration was oppressive, due to its length. He also asserts that the pretrial incarceration in Silver Bow County deprived him of the possibility a concurrent sentence and was prejudicial. The State responds that Stewart was released on bail on the Yellowstone County case and, but for his arrest in the Silver Bow case, he would not have been incarcerated at all. The State cites our holding in <em>Butterfly </em>that incarceration resulting from \u201cprevious felonies unrelated\u201d to the case at issue are not oppressive. <em>Butterfly, </em>\u00b6 38. We agree that Stewart\u2019s Silver Bow County detention is not considered oppressive for purposes of his Yellowstone County case.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">Balancing</p>\n<p id=\"A3q\">\u00b618  Stewart was responsible for much more of the delay than the State. While the State bears some responsibility for the 425 days of delay beyond the 200-day threshold, the primary responsibility for this delay lies with Stewart. Factors two, three, and four all weigh against Stewart, and the overall balancing, clearly, weighs against his claim. Thus, we conclude that the District Court correctly denied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>Stewart\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of speedy trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">\u00b619 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b347-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES SHEA, McKINNON and WHEAT concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b340-13\"> The record before us includes both the Yellowstone County and Silver Bow County cases.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b342-11\"> The parties agree the calculation is actually 625 days.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b342-12\"> The District Court calculated this length to be 194 days; however, it is actually 193 days.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b346-10\"> At the April 13, 2015 <em>Finley </em>hearing, Stewart testified that his defense counsel \u201cis fine.
