Lawrence raises allegations of prosecutorial misconduct, ineffective assistance of counsel, and an abuse of discretion by the District Court. We reverse and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">\u00b62 Lawrence raises four issues on appeal. We restate the dispositive issue as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-7\"><em>Whether the prosecutor\u2019s comments during closing arguments require reversal under the plain error </em>doctrine?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b111-9\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b111-10\">\u00b63 On April 8, 2014, Lawrence and his brother, Steven Dubois, arrived at Wayne Miller Coins on Last Chance Gulch in Helena, Montana. Lawrence and Dubois entered the shop after being buzzed in through the back door. Lawrence was in possession of coins he wished to have appraised, something he had done previously at Miller Coins. After Wayne Miller, the owner of the shop, informed him that his coins were valueless, Lawrence perused the store while questioning a store employee, Emily Gleason, about some of the items. Meanwhile, Dubois made his way to the back door, apparently intent on leaving the store. While following his brother out of the shop, Lawrence stopped to admire artwork adorning the walls of the hallway. As Lawrence continued to look at the artwork, Dubois grabbed a shipping package containing roughly $10,500 in silver, one-ounce coins and exited the store. Lawrence then started toward the back door. Gleason saw Dubois take the package and hurried to the back of the store to confront Lawrence. After a brief exchange, Lawrence left and got in a car with Dubois, who drove away. Lawrence was apprehended the next day in possession of a backpack containing nearly half of the stolen silver coins.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-11\">\u00b64 Lawrence was charged with theft under \u00a7 45-6-301(l)(a), MCA. A two-day trial was held in the First Judicial District Court, Lewis and Clark County. During closing argument, the prosecutor told the jury, \u201cThe presumption of innocence that you came into this trial with no longer exists at this point.\u201d Defense counsel did not object. Subsequently, the jury found Lawrence guilty of felony theft and he was sentenced to ten years in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-12\">\u00b65 On appeal, Lawrence raises a myriad of arguments, alleging that the prosecutor committed plain error requiring reversal by stripping Lawrence of the presumption of innocence as well as misstating the law of the charged offense. Further, Lawrence argues that the District Court abused its discretion by not granting a mistrial after the State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>violated an order in limine, and that defense counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to object to prosecutorial misconduct, an erroneous jury instruction, and hearsay testimony by a witness for the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">\u00b66 In general, this Court does not address issues of \u201c \u2018prosecutorial misconduct pertaining to a prosecutor\u2019s statements not objected to at trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Aker, </em>2013 MT 253, \u00b6 21, 371 Mont. 491, 310 P.3d 506 (quoting <em>State v. Longfellow, </em>2008 MT 343, \u00b6 24, 346 Mont. 286, 194 P.3d 694). However, we may exercise our discretion and review such issues under the plain error doctrine. <em>Aker, </em>\u00b6 21 (citing <em>State v. Lacey, </em>2012 MT 52, \u00b6 14, 364 Mont. 291, 272 P.3d 1288); <em>State v. Hayden, </em>2008 MT 274, \u00b6 17, 345 Mont. 252, 190 P.3d 1091. The plain error doctrine is to be used sparingly, and only on a case-by-case basis. <em>Hayden, </em>\u00b6 17. Once the doctrine is invoked, this Court\u2019s review is grounded in our \u201cinherent duty to interpret the constitution and to protect individual rights set forth in the constitution.\u201d <em>State v. Finley, </em>276 Mont. 126, 134, 915 P.2d 208, 213 (1996), <em>overruled on other grounds State v. Gallagher, </em>2001 MT 39, \u00b6 21, 304 Mont. 215, 19 P.3d 817.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">\u00b67 We do not reach the issues regarding the order in limine, the alleged hearsay, or the jury instruction, nor do we reach the question of whether defense counsel\u2019s failure to object to the prosecutor\u2019s statement constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel. Pertinent here, Lawrence argues the prosecutor\u2019s statement regarding the presumption of innocence constitutes plain error requiring reversal and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-9\">\u00b68 <em>Whether the prosecutor\u2019s comments during closing arguments require reversal under the plain error </em>doctrine?</p>\n<p id=\"b112-10\">\u00b69 The purpose of the plain error doctrine is to correct an error not objected to at trial that affects the \u201cfairness, integrity, and public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Finley, </em>276 Mont. at 134, 915 P.2d at 213. The plain error doctrine may be used \u201c \u2018in situations that implicate a defendant\u2019s fundamental constitutional rights,\u2019 \u201d and where \u201c \u2018failing to review the alleged error may result in a manifest miscarriage of justice, leave unsettled the question of the fundamental fairness of the proceedings, or compromise the integrity of the judicial process.\u2019\u2019\u2019 <em>Aker, </em>\u00b6 21 <em>(quoting State v. McDonald, </em>2013 MT 97, \u00b6 8, 369 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>Mont. 483, 299 P.3d 799). Therefore, we first determine whether the defendant\u2019s fundamental constitutional rights have been implicated.</p>\n<p id=\"AC8\">\u00b610 The underlying question here is a simple one: whether a prosecutor stating during closing argument that the presumption of innocence has been removed from the defendant implicates a defendant\u2019s fundamental rights. We cannot overstate the importance of the foundational principle that is the presumption of innocence. It is a bedrock, axiomatic, and elementary tenet of our criminal justice system. <em>State v. Williams, </em>184 Mont. 111, 112, 601 P.2d 1194, 1195 (1979). Further, enforcement of this principle, meaning its application to each and every criminal defendant, \u201clies at the foundation of the administration of our criminal law.\u201d <em>Coffin v. United States, </em>156 U.S. 432, 453, 15 S. Ct. 394, 403 (1895). Therefore, we determine that the comment by the prosecutor stating the presumption of innocence no longer applied to the defendant implicated the defendant\u2019s fundamental rights. We next determine whether a failure to review this alleged error might result in a \u201c \u2018manifest miscarriage of justice, leave unsettled the question of the fundamental fairness of the proceedings, or compromise the integrity of the judicial process.\u2019\u2019\u2019 <em>Aker, </em>\u00b6 21 (quoting <em>McDonald, </em>\u00b6 8).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">\u00b611 This Court has, on numerous occasions, refused to invoke the plain error doctrine because the alleged error did not result in a miscarriage of justice, raise a question as to the fundamental fairness of the proceedings, or compromise the integrity of the judicial process. <em>See, e.g., McDonald, </em>\u00b6 17 (concluding that the challenged comment in closing argument did not raise the specter of prosecutorial misconduct necessitating the exercise of plain error review to protect the fundamental fairness of the proceeding); <em>State v. Thorp, </em>2010 MT 92, \u00b6\u00b6 25-30, 356 Mont. 150, 231 P.3d 1096 (determining that a cautionary instruction was sufficient under the circumstances to remedy any alleged infringement on the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to a fair trial). However, we have also previously determined that prosecutorial misconduct may warrant relief under the plain error doctrine.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>\u00b612 This Court has not previously been faced with comments such as those at issue in this case. Due to the gravity of the presumption of innocence within our criminal justice system, we determine that the challenged comment, \u201c[t]he presumption of innocence that you came into this trial with no longer exists at this point,\u201d leaves unsettled the question of whether or not the proceedings were fundamentally fair and compromises the integrity of the judicial process. Therefore, as we find that the circumstances of the instant case warrant application of the plain error doctrine, we proceed to address the merits of the alleged error.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">\u00b613 \u201cBoth the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article II, Section 24 of the Montana Constitution guarantee criminal defendants \u2018the right to a fair trial by a jury.\u2019 \u201d <em>Aker, </em>\u00b6 24 (quoting <em>Hayden, </em>\u00b6 27). Prosecutorial misconduct \u201cmay be grounds for reversing a conviction and granting a new trial if the conduct deprives the defendant of a fair and impartial trial.\u201d <em>Hayden, </em>\u00b6 27. It is well established that we \u201c \u2018consider alleged improper statements during closing argument in the context of the entire argument.\u2019 \u201d <em>Aker, </em>\u00b6 24 (quoting <em>State v. Makarchuk, </em>2009 MT 82, \u00b6 24, 349 Mont. 507, 204 P.3d 1213). We \u201cdo not presume prejudice from the alleged prosecutorial misconduct; rather, the \u2018defendant must show that the argument violated his substantial rights.\u2019 \u201d <em>Aker, </em>\u00b6 24 (quoting <em>McDonald, </em>\u00b6 10).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">\u00b614 Therefore, we must determine whether the challenged comment deprived the defendant of a fair and impartial trial. In making this determination, we consider the challenged comment in the context of the trial and the closing argument as a whole. Further, we consider whether the challenged comment violated the defendant\u2019s substantial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">\u00b615 As stated above, there are few principles in our criminal justice system as fundamental as the presumption of innocence. The principle is so foundational that we have recognized \u201cit cannot be evidence, nor can it be introduced in the case, for it is in the case from its inception.\u201d <em>State v. De Lea, </em>36 Mont. 531, 539, 93 P. 814, 817 (1908). The presumption of innocence is the \u201csafeguard which the law casts around all persons accused of a crime, and the defendant cannot be reached by a verdict of guilty until this safeguard is entirely removed.\u201d <em>De Lea, </em>36 Mont. at 539, 93 P. at 817. Further, and most importantly in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>instant case, the presumption endures throughout the deliberations of the jury and may only be overcome \u201cby evidence which satisfies the minds of the jurors beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>De Lea, </em>36 Mont. at 539, 93 P. at 817. The presumption remains attached to the defendant as he or she appears in the minds of the jurors after the jury has heard the entirety of the evidence and begun its deliberation. Indeed, it is improper to say that the presumption may be removed from a defendant at any time; rather, the presumption is overcome upon his or her conviction in a court of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">\u00b616 In our criminal justice system, the presumption has been overcome when the State has presented evidence against a criminal defendant that satisfies a jury, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant is guilty of the crime charged. <em>De Lea, </em>36 Mont. at 540, 93 P. at 817-18. To that end, we instruct the jurors that they are to refrain from making their decision as to the guilt or innocence of a defendant until they have considered whether the State has overcome the presumption of innocence beyond a reasonable doubt. The prosecutor\u2019s statement made prior to deliberation of the jury that the presumption of innocence no longer attached violated this bedrock principle of law.</p>\n<p id=\"avl-dedup-0\">\u00b617 It is reasonable and required that both the State and defense counsel jealously guard this principle throughout the entirety of a criminal trial. It is clear from the record that defense counsel failed to object to the challenged statement, yet that does not relieve a prosecutor of his or her duty. The United States Supreme Court has stated that \u201cit is as much [the Prosecutor\u2019s] duty to refrain from improper methods calculated to produce a wrongful conviction as it is to use every legitimate means to bring about a just one.\u201d <em>Berger v. United States, </em>295 U.S. 78, 88, 55 S. Ct. 629, 633 (1935). We agree. By stating that the presumption of innocence no longer applied to the defendant, the prosecutor improperly abdicated this duty and deprived the defendant of his fundamental right to a fair and impartial trial by jury as guaranteed by Article II, Section 24, of the Montana Constitution, and the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">\u00b618 Here, it was Dubois, not Lawrence, who physically removed the coins from the store. Lawrence testified on his own behalf, telling the jurors that he did not want to keep the coins his brother had given him and intended to give them back to the coin shop, hopefully without exposing himself to prosecution. However, he was arrested before he could do so. While the jury was free to disbelieve this testimony, the fact remains that under these circumstances, the presumption of innocence was critical to Lawrence\u2019s defense. When the prosecutor told <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>the jury the presumption of innocence no longer existed and his lawyer raised no objection or argument in opposition to that assertion, the jury could well have concluded that the prosecutor was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">\u00b619 Viewing the challenged comment in the context of the surrounding statement provides support for our conclusion that the prosecutor engaged in misconduct requiring relief. In full, the prosecutor stated, \u201cThe presumption of innocence that you came into this trial with no longer exists at this point. The instruction doesn\u2019t say that you have to believe what the defendant told you. You can use your common sense in determining what happened in this case.\u201d We infer that the instruction to which the prosecutor refers is Instruction No. 4 which states, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-6\">The Defendant is presumed to be innocent of the charge against him. This presumption remains with him throughout every stage of the trial and during your deliberations on the verdict. It is not overcome unless from all the evidence in the case you are convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the Defendant is guilty. The Defendant is not required to prove his innocence or present any evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">This preliminary instruction was given by the district court at the commencement of the trial, but was not read again at the conclusion of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"ALJ\">\u00b620  The prosecutor is the representative of the State at trial and must be held to a standard commensurate with his or her position. Noting this, the United States Supreme Court has rightly observed that a prosecutor\u2019s improper suggestions and assertions to a jury \u201care apt to carry much weight against the accused when they should properly carry none.\u201d <em>Berger, </em>295 U.S. at 88, 55 S. Ct. at 633. We conclude that these statements could cause a reasonable juror to question the language of the preliminary jury instruction and, therefore, have the potential effect of removing the presumption of innocence from the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-9\">\u00b621 Our conclusion here finds support in a Tenth Circuit case in which a similar representation was made by a prosecutor during closing arguments to a jury. In <em>Mahorney v. Wallman, </em>917 F.2d 469 (10th Cir. 1990), the Court of Appeals held that a prosecutor\u2019s argument that the presumption of innocence had been removed from the defendant violated the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights and constituted reversible error. <em>Mahorney, </em>917 F.2d at 473-74. We conclude that the same result must be reached here.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-10\">\u00b622 It is our \u201cinherent to duty ... to protect individual rights set forth in the constitution.\u201d <em>Finley, </em>276 Mont. at 134, 915 P.2d at 213. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>therefore decline to accept the State\u2019s contention and the Dissent\u2019s assertion that the prosecutor\u2019s statements were appropriate comments on the evidence undeserving of plain error review. Dissent, \u00b6 37. Rather, we conclude that the challenged comments made by the prosecutor constitute prosecutorial misconduct from which the defendant is entitled to relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">\u00b623  We determine that the prosecutor\u2019s comments require reversal of Lawrence\u2019s conviction. Because we grant relief based on prosecutorial misconduct during closing arguments, we do not reach the merits of the additional issues raised by Lawrence on appeal. We reverse and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<judges id=\"b117-7\">JUSTICES WHEAT, McKINNON and SHEA concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b113-6\"> In <em>State v. Hayden, </em>we reversed and remanded for a new trial based on the prosecutor\u2019s comments. <em>Hayden, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 30-33. In <em>Hayden, </em>the prosecutor\u2019s challenged statements included, in part, offering his own opinion as to witness testimony during closing argument, stating that the jury could rely on the detective\u2019s testimony, and improperly testifying to the efficacy ofthe search during closing argument. <em>Hayden, </em>\u00b6 32. In summary, we determined that the prosecutor\u2019s comments unfairly added \u201cthe probative force of his own personal, professional, and official influence to the testimony ofthe witnesses,\u201d and that the prosecutor\u2019s conduct invaded the role ofthe jury. <em>Hayden, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>\u00b6 33. In light of these two concerns, we determined that the record left \u201cunsettled the question of the fundamental fairness of the proceedings.\u201d <em>Hayden, </em>\u00b6 33.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b117-8\">JUSTICE BAKER,</author>\n<p id=\"Azi\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-9\">\u00b624 I agree with the Court\u2019s determination to review for plain error the prosecutor\u2019s statement regarding the presumption of innocence because that statement implicated Lawrence\u2019s fundamental rights. The statement was improper and objectionable. But I share the Dissent\u2019s view that, when reviewed in context, the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument does not justify reversing the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-10\">\u00b625 The Court\u2019s reliance on <em>Mahorney </em>is misplaced. <em>Mahorney </em>is distinguishable because in that case \u201cdefense counsel vigorously objected both during voir dire and closing argument to the prosecutor\u2019s misconduct and was immediately and categorically overruled in the presence of the jury.\u201d <em>Mahorney, </em>917 F.2d at 473. In reversing for a new trial, the Tenth Circuit concluded that the trial court placed an \u201cofficial imprimatur ... upon the prosecution\u2019s misstatements of law [which] obviously amplified their potential prejudicial effect on the jury.\u201d <em>Mahorney, </em>917 F.2d at 473. \u201cMoreover,\u201d the Tenth Circuit went on, \u201cthe trial court did not thereafter attempt to cure or minimize the problem through admonishment or special instruction of the jury.\u201d <em>Mahorney, </em>917 F.2d at 473. Thus, the Tenth Circuit concluded, \u201cthe factors that have permitted some courts to overlook similar prosecutorial misrepresentations are not present in this case.\u201d <em>Mahorney, </em>917 F.2d at 474.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-11\">\u00b626 The Court also fails to consider the State\u2019s \u201calleged improper statements during closing argument in the context of the entire argument.\u201d <em>State v. Makarchuk, </em>2009 MT 82, \u00b6 24, 349 Mont. 507, 204 P.3d 1213. As the Dissent observes, the prosecutor focused on the evidence presented at trial. In her rebuttal argument the prosecutor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-5\">The State of Montana has the burden of proving the guilt of the defendant beyond a reasonable doubt. And the State accepts that burden; I think it\u2019s fair. It says: Proof beyond a reasonable doubt is proof of such convincing character that a reasonable person would rely and act upon that in the most important of his or her own affairs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">She then proceeded to explain reasonable doubt and to discuss the evidence and inferences the jury properly should draw from it in order to reach a guilty verdict. I would not reverse the conviction on the basis of the prosecutor\u2019s single \u201cpresumption of innocence\u201d comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">\u00b627 Despite my disagreement with the Court\u2019s analysis, I join the decision to reverse Lawrence\u2019s conviction because I am convinced that this is the rare case in which the cumulative effect of the errors he has shown on appeal prejudiced his right to a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">\u00b628 Lawrence asserts the following additional errors: the prosecutor\u2019s misstatement of the law of the charged offense; defense counsel\u2019s failure to object to the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument; defense counsel\u2019s failure to object to an erroneous mens rea instruction; and defense counsel\u2019s failure to object to hearsay testimony. I would conclude that, when considered as a whole, these errors prejudiced Lawrence\u2019s right to a fair trial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b118-9\">\u00b629 The cumulative error doctrine \u201crefers to a number of errors that, taken together, prejudice a defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial.\u201d <em>State v. Novak, </em>2005 MT 294, \u00b6 35, 329 Mont. 309, 124 P.3d 182; <em>accord State v. Giddings, </em>2009 MT 61, \u00b6 100, 349 Mont. 347, 208 P.3d 363; <em>State v. Bar-Jonah, </em>2004 MT 344, \u00b6 108, 324 Mont. 278, 102 P.3d 1229. Under the doctrine, \u201cIr lever.sal is required ... once such accumulated errors are identified as having prejudiced a defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial.\u201d <em>Novak, </em>\u00b6 35. It is the defendant\u2019s duty to prove the existence of prejudice. <em>Novak, </em>\u00b6 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-10\">\u00b630 In evaluating a cumulative error argument based on several enumerated errors, courts</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-11\">must consider each such claim against the background of the case as a whole, paying particular weight to factors such as the nature and number of the errors committed; their interrelationship, if any, and combined effect; how the district court dealt with the errors as they arose ...; and the strength of the government\u2019s case. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>The run of the trial may also be important; a handful of miscues, in combination, may often pack a greater punch in a short trial than in a much longer trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b119-5\"><em>United States v. Sepulveda, </em>15 F.3d 1161, 1196 (1st Cir. 1993) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">\u00b631 Here, over the course of a two-day trial, there were several interrelated errors that had the combined effect of prejudicing Lawrence\u2019s right to a fair trial. During closing argument, the prosecutor implied that because Lawrence had not returned the coins \u201cimmediately,\u201d he had committed theft under \u00a7 45-6-301(l)(a), MCA. Though made in response to the defense closing argument, this misstated the law, which requires a purpose to deprive the owner of his property. The error, which otherwise could have been a minor one, was compounded by the District Court\u2019s instructions as to the mens rea for theft. The court gave a result-based \u201cknowingly\u201d instruction and a conduct-based \u201cpurposely\u201d instruction. This was not a correct statement of the law. Theft is a result-based crime because it requires a \u201cpurpose to deprive\u201d the owner of property. <em>See State v. Shively, </em>2009 MT 252, \u00b6\u00b6 17-18, 351 Mont. 513, 216 P.3d 732 (concluding that the State is not required to prove that a defendant knows the property is stolen to be convicted under \u00a7 45-6-301, MCA, because the statute requires a knowing exertion of control over the property with the purpose to deprive the owner). Even though the court informed the jury of that element, it didn\u2019t correctly define for the jury what \u201cpurpose\u201d meant in proving the elements of theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">\u00b632 During the trial Officer Zapata testified that another officer advised him that Lawrence \u201cwas possibly in Stewart Homes trying to sell stolen coins from the theft.\u201d The officer\u2019s hearsay testimony was the only evidence about any intent Lawrence may have had to sell the stolen property. Defense counsel did not object. Certainly, there is nothing constitutionally impermissible about the admission of hearsay evidence. Nor is there a mandate for counsel to raise every objection that might have merit. But the State has not argued that any hearsay exception applied, and an objection surely would have been sustained. It was an important piece of evidence, particularly in light of the defense theory\u2014that Lawrence had not acted with the purpose of depriving the owner of the coins. Lawrence was arrested less than two days after the theft occurred. He claimed at trial that he helped Dubois remove the stolen coins from the home of an acquaintance because there were children present. He testified that he was trying to figure out a way to get the coins back to Wayne Miller\u2019s shop without incident because he knew and respected Miller\u2019s wife, who runs a homeless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>shelter in Helena. This perhaps sounds like an implausible story. And a jury would be free to reject his testimony. But that assumes a trial safeguarded by the protections of the Constitution, including the effective assistance of counsel, instructions that correctly state the applicable law, and the full protection of the presumption of innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"AkKH\">\u00b633 Had any of the claimed mistakes been isolated in an otherwise error-free trial, none would justify reversal. But cumulatively, they resulted in a trial in which inadmissible evidence was the only proof of an element of the offense on which the jury was improperly instructed and which the prosecutor misstated in argument, along with her unartful short-circuiting of the presumption of innocence. There was no plausible strategic reason for counsel\u2019s failure to seek exclusion of harmful evidence or to propose a correct instruction on mental state when it was a key theory of the defense. <em>See State v. Kougl, </em>2004 MT 243, \u00b6 20, 323 Mont. 6, 97 P.3d 1095 (concluding that defendant was given ineffective assistance of counsel, in part, because counsel \u201cfailed to use the law to strike at the heart of the State\u2019s case\u201d). Lawrence has, in my view, sustained his burden to show that the combination of miscues in his brief trial prejudiced his right to a fair shake. I agree with the decision to give him a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b118-12\"> I do not include in this list Lawrence\u2019s argument regarding a witness\u2019s passing reference to \u201cbooking photos.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b120-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH,</author>\n<p id=\"A4W\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">\u00b634 The statement referenced by the majority was made as part of a closing argument, the summation made by the attorneys following the conclusion of the presentation of evidence to the jury. The statement was made at the end of that closing argument, following her summation of all the evidence submitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">\u00b635 Taken in context of the entire proceeding, it is clear that the prosecution was not suggesting that the defendant was not entitled to the presumption of innocence, but rather making the argument that the evidence she had just summarized would overcome that presumption of innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-8\">\u00b636 The jurors were properly instructed by the District Court Judge. Instruction No. 4 provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-9\">The Defendant is presumed to be innocent of the charge against him. This presumption remains with him throughout every stage of the trial and during your deliberations on the verdict. It is not overcome unless from all the evidence in the case you are convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the Defendant is guilty. The Defendant is not required to prove his innocence or present any evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-10\">Significantly, Instruction No. 2 provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-11\">You should take the law in this case from my instructions alone. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>You should not accept anyone else\u2019s version as to what the law is in this case. You should not decide this case contrary to these instructions, even though you might believe the law ought to be otherwise. Counsel, however, may comment and argue to the jury upon the law as given in these instructions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">\u00b637 Instructions are not only read aloud by the judge, but they are provided to the jury in writing to be taken into deliberations for the purpose of review by the jurors. They clearly provide that jurors should take the law from the instructions alone, and not accept other versions of what the law is. The prosecutor\u2019s closing statement here was a comment on the evidence presented and not intended to counter the law as it was clearly given in the District Court instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">\u00b638 As the majority notes, the plain error doctrine should be used sparingly, and only in cases where the alleged error may \u201cresult in a manifest miscarriage of justice, leave unsettled the question of the fundamental fairness of the proceeding, or compromise the integrity of the judicial process.\u201d <em>McDonald, </em>\u00b6 8. Viewed in context of the entire trial,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> particularly the instructions, this comment made by the prosecutor at the end of the closing argument, after summarizing the evidence presented to the jury, does not meet the standard required to invoke plain error review.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">\u00b639 Closing argument is a unique portion of a trial. It is an opportunity for the attorneys to present the case as they see it. And by its very nature, it is argument\u2014not evidence. Jurors understand the function of argument. The lawyers in the case understand the function of closing argument and objecting in a closing argument is seldom necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">\u00b640 For the reasons stated above, I dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b121-9\">JUSTICE RICE joins the Dissent of CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b121-10\"> The prosecutor also made it clear in her final closing argument that the State has the burden of proving the charges beyond a reasonable doubt, and that they readily accept that challenge.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
