Bird filed a wrongful discharge claim against the County and the Board of Commissioners. The Eighth Judicial District Court held that the County had good cause to terminate Bird. It granted the County summary judgment. Bird appeals on the ground that a jury must determine the issue of good cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-8\">\u00b62 We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-9\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b94-10\">\u00b63 The County hired Bird as Human Resources Director in October 2008. Bird directly supervised four employees and managed a $350,000 budget. Bird oversaw typical human resource functions, including: supervising payroll for all County employees; administering and enforcing collective bargaining agreements; ensuring compliance with state and federal employment laws; drafting and implementing human resource policies; and administering the County\u2019s benefits programs. Bird also was responsible for redrafting the County\u2019s Policy and Procedures Manual, which she never completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-11\">\u00b64 As a department head, Bird reported to the Board of County Commissioners. In December 2010, the Board sent Bird a letter expressing several elected officials\u2019 concerns regarding their working relationship with the Human Resources Department. The letter identified four issues the elected officials wanted Bird to address:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-12\">* Improving the transparency of the hiring process;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-13\">* Ensuring that engagement in preferential hiring practices is not occurring;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-14\">* Aligning personnel policies with established procedures; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-15\">* Seeking a more collaborative approach to problem-solving.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ANq9\">Board members also met with Bird individually to discuss how they could improve their working relationship with her.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-16\">\u00b65 In October 2012, a group of department heads\u2014which Bird helped to organize\u2014wrote a letter to the Board requesting to meet and discuss various issues they had regarding the \u201cappearance of unfair, disparate, and unequal treatment regarding merit and market adjustments\u201d to compensation. The Board declined to meet with the department heads <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>as a group given that the department heads \u201crepresent! ed| six different departments, each having a diverse range of responsibilities, job descriptions, budgets, number of subordinates, educational backgrounds, training, experience, and longevity with the County.\u201d The Board instead offered to meet with them individually to evaluate their compensation. In response, these department heads took \u201ca unanimous vote of \u2018no confidence\u2019 \u201d regarding two of the three Board members. Shortly after the \u201cno confidence\u201d vote, two other department heads informed the County Attorney of their concern that the group had leaked confidential employee information to the media. The County Attorney recommended that the Board conduct an investigation into the allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">\u00b66 On October 26, 2012, the County placed Bird on administrative leave while it investigated allegations that she used public time and resources to organize support for one of the Commissioner\u2019s election opponents, disclosed confidential employment information, and disclosed or used confidential information to further her personal economic interests. Upon conclusion of the investigation, the County sent Bird a \u201cdue process\u201d letter that provided detailed information regarding the results of the investigation, notified her of additional allegations that were investigated, and advised her of potential disciplinary actions. Bird responded in writing, denying the allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">\u00b67 On November 27, 2012, the County sent Bird a termination letter signed by two of the three Board members. The six-page termination letter addressed Bird\u2019s response to the \u201cdue process\u201d letter and further detailed the reasons for her discharge. The reasons included: use of public time and resources for political purposes, disclosure of confidential employee information, use and disclosure of confidential information to further her own economic interests, improper management of staff, implementation of policies without the Board\u2019s formal approval, inconsistent implementation of informal policies, failure to update the Policy and Procedures Manual, and failure to understand key aspects of her position.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">\u00b68 A year later, Bird filed a complaint against the County pursuant to the Wrongful Discharge from Employment Act. The County moved for summary judgment. The District Court concluded that, as Human Resources Director, Bird held a sensitive managerial position. It held that the County had good cause to terminate her. The court therefore granted the County\u2019s motion and entered judgment in its favor. Bird appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">\u00b69 We review summary judgment rulings de novo, applying the standards set forth in M. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(3). <em>Moe v. Butte-Silver Bow Cnty., </em>2016 MT 103, \u00b6 14, 383 Mont. 297, 371 P.3d 415. Summary judgment is appropriate when the moving party demonstrates both the absence of any genuine issues of material fact and entitlement to judgment as a matter of law. M. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(3); Moe, \u00b6 14. Once the moving party has met its burden, the opposing party must present material and substantial evidence to raise a genuine issue of material fact. <em>McConkey v. Flathead Elec. Coop., </em>2005 MT 334, \u00b6 19, 330 Mont. 48, 125 P.3d 1121. We will draw all reasonable inferences from the offered evidence in favor of the party opposing summary judgment; but conclusory statements, speculative assertions, and mere denials are insufficient to defeat a motion for summary judgment. <em>Moe, </em>\u00b6 14. We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether they are correct. <em>Moe, </em>\u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">\u00b610 <em>Whether the District Court erred in ruling on summary judgment that the County had good cause to terminate Bird\u2019s employment.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b96-8\">\u00b611 The Wrongful Discharge from Employment Act provides, in pertinent part, that \u201c[a] discharge is wrongful... if... the discharge was not for good cause.\u201d Section 39-2-904(1), MCA. The Act defines \u201cgood cause\u201d as \u201creasonable job-related grounds for dismissal based on a failure to satisfactorily perform job duties, disruption of the employer\u2019s operation, or other legitimate business reason.\u201d Section 39-2-903(5), MCA. A legitimate business reason is a reason \u201cthat is not false, whimsical, arbitrary, or capricious, and one that must have some logical relationship to the needs of the business.\u201d <em>Davis v. State, </em>2015 MT 264, \u00b6 10, 381 Mont. 59, 357 P.3d 320. After an employer presents evidence showing good cause for the discharge, the employee must present evidence establishing either that \u201cthe given reason for the discharge is not good cause in and of itself, or that the given reason is a pretext and not the honest reason for the discharge.\u201d <em>Becker v. Rosebud Operating Servs., </em>2008 MT 285, \u00b6 24, 345 Mont. 368, 191 P.3d 435 (citation and internal quotes omitted). Summary judgment is appropriate in wrongful discharge actions when \u201cthe undisputed facts show good cause for discharge from employment.\u201d <em>Moe, </em>\u00b6 50 (citing <em>Davis, </em>\u00b6 14; <em>Becker, </em>\u00b6 30).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-9\">\u00b612 An employer has the right \u201cto exercise discretion over whom it will employ and keep in employment.\u201d <em>Sullivan v. Cont\u2019l Constr. of Mont., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number><em>LLC, </em>2013 MT 106, \u00b6 18, 370 Mont. 8, 299 P.3d 832 (citation and internal quotations omitted). To give effect to this right, we have warned against the courts becoming \u201cinvolved in the day-to-day employment decisions of a business regarding its management.\u201d <em>Sullivan, </em>\u00b6 18. Thus, we have held repeatedly that \u201c[e]mployers have the broadest discretion when dealing with managerial employees.\u201d <em>Moe, </em>\u00b6 54; <em>accord Baumgart v. State, </em>2014 MT 194, \u00b6 39, 376 Mont. 1, 332 P.3d 225; <em>Sullivan, </em>\u00b6 18; <em>McConkey, </em>\u00b6 26; <em>Buck v. Billings Mont. Chevrolet, </em>248 Mont. 276, 283, 811 P.2d 537, 541 (1991). In determining whether an employee occupies a managerial position, we consider factors such as the employee\u2019s responsibilities in running the organization\u2019s day-to-day operations, the employee\u2019s discretion in undertaking those responsibilities, the level of trust placed in the employee, and the nature of the relationship between the employee and her superiors. <em>Baumgart, </em>\u00b6 39; <em>Sullivan, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 24-25; <em>McConkey, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 30-31; <em>Buck, </em>248 Mont. at 282-83, 811 P.2d at 540-41.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">\u00b613 The District Court noted that \u201c[m]ost of Bird\u2019s summary judgment response focuses on whether she is a managerial employee under <em>Sullivan.\u201d </em>The court ruled that Bird held a managerial position, stating that \u201cBird directed and administered human resource management services for one of Montana\u2019s largest county governments.\u201d The court found that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-6\">Bird handled such duties as hiring, discipline and termination of employees; compliance with state and federal employment laws; collective bargaining; labor relations; employee orientation; training and development; compensation; employee benefits; job analysis and evaluation; payroll procedures, operations, and requirements; workers compensation; personnel investigations; and safety and risk management.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">Based on these duties, the court concluded, \u201cIt is clear that Bird occupied a \u2018sensitive managerial or confidential position ... requiring] the exercise of broad discretion.\u2019 \u201d (Quoting <em>Sullivan, </em>\u00b6 21.) The court thus held that \u201cthe County is entitled to greater deference in its decision to terminate Bird.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">\u00b614  On appeal, Bird argues that the District Court\u2019s analysis regarding whether she held a managerial position \u201cappears to be based on ... Bird\u2019s title, rather than her actual function within [the] County and her level of discretion in relation to the Board.\u201d She asserts that \u201c[s]he supervised only four employees and did not manage a large budget,\u201d and that \u201c[s]he was also closely supervised by the Board ... and the County Attorney.\u201d But Bird does not challenge any of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>court\u2019s specific findings describing her duties as Human Resources Director. The number of people she directly supervised and the amount of money allocated to her department are not the only defining features of her position. As the person in charge of human services, Bird was a key player in the management team, entrusted with confidential employee information and counted on to keep the workplace running smoothly. The head of human services plays an integral role in overseeing and addressing the needs of an organization. Bird\u2019s conclusory statements are insufficient to overcome the District Court\u2019s conclusion on summary judgment that she was a managerial employee. <em>See Moe, </em>\u00b6 14. Accordingly, we conclude that the District Court correctly determined that the County was entitled to greater discretion in its decision to terminate Bird.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">\u00b615 Of course, the County\u2019s \u201cbroad discretion in handling managerial employees is not absolute.\u201d <em>Moe, </em>\u00b6 57. The District Court found that the County had good cause because it \u201cterminated Bird for failing to perform her job duties, insubordination, use of public property for private purposes, and disrespect to other employees.\u201d These reasons, the court determined, qualified as legitimate business reasons. The court thus concluded that Bird bore the burden to show that the County\u2019s stated reasons were pretextual in order to defeat summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">\u00b616 The court found \u201cno evidence that [the] County\u2019s reasons for [Bird\u2019s] termination are pretextual or dishonest.\u201d The court recognized Bird\u2019s assertions that the need for operations manual revisions existed before her employment and that no other department head who signed the \u201cno confidence\u201d letter was disciplined. The court concluded, however, that neither of these assertions, \u201cif true, establish pretext.\u201d The District Court held that Bird failed to establish that the County lacked good cause to terminate her and accordingly granted the County summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">\u00b617 Bird cites the following evidence to support her contention that the District Court ignored material facts on the issue of good cause: that in her four-year tenure as Human Resources Director, she never had a performance-based warning, write-up, or reprimand; that another employee took responsibility for disclosing some of the confidential employee information she was accused of disclosing; and that one of the Board members did not sign her termination letter and testified during his deposition that he believed that she should not have been fired. Bird then asserts, \u201cWhether there was any truth to each of the proffered reasons for firing [her], as set forth in the Termination Letter, is also disputed,\u201d and whether the County\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>reasons for terminating her were true, \u201cand not merely pretext, is also disputed.\u201d She asserts that a jury reasonably could conclude that the County did not have good cause for firing her based, in part, on \u201cthe parties\u2019 different characterizations of the evidence.\u201d Finally, she relies on <em>Moe </em>to assert that she \u201craised sufficient factual disputes that would support a conclusion that the reason for her discharge was not for good cause in and of itself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">\u00b618 We held in <em>Moe </em>that the employee presented sufficient evidence to raise a triable issue of fact regarding good cause because she \u201csubmitted a detailed written response to the [employer\u2019s fact-finding investigative] report in which she took issue with nearly all of the allegations against her.\u201d <em>Moe, </em>\u00b6 59. After analyzing the evidence, we concluded that the employee \u201cpresented exhaustive responses to the allegations against her.\u201d Moe, \u00b6 62. Because of the substantial evidence refuting the employer\u2019s assertions, we were \u201cunable to conclude that the facts that are undisputed are sufficient to establish good cause.\u201d <em>Moe, </em>\u00b6 63.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">\u00b619 We are unpersuaded by Bird\u2019s reliance on <em>Moe. </em>For starters, the employee in <em>Moe </em>had only a short time to rectify the problems her superiors identified in her performance before she was terminated. <em>Moe, </em>\u00b6 61. Here, the Board brought to Bird\u2019s attention the need to improve her working relationships nearly two years before she was terminated. True, like the employee in <em>Moe, </em>Bird submitted a written response to the County\u2019s due process letter taking issue with the allegations against her. Unlike the employee\u2019s response in <em>Moe, </em>however, the majority of Bird\u2019s responses amount to \u201cconclusory statements, speculative assertions, and mere denials.\u201d <em>Moe, </em>\u00b6 63 (citation and internal quotes omitted). For example, in response to the County\u2019s allegation that she disclosed confidential information regarding an employee\u2019s pay, Bird responded that she had \u201cnot breached any confidential information.\u201d She explained that because the employee had discussed the information, it was no longer confidential. But Bird did not deny publicly disclosing that the employee was considered for a sizeable reduction in pay. Her response demonstrated a failure to appreciate that, as Human Resources Director, she had a responsibility to maintain trust in her ability to handle sensitive personnel matters. In response to the allegation that she failed to update the Policy and Procedures Manual, she simply asserted that she was not directed to do so, that a \u201ccomplete re-write was not provided to me,\u201d and that the groups that provided updates to the manual did not do so in the correct format. Bird similarly minimized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>the County\u2019s allegation that all of her Human Resources employees expressed fear that she would retaliate against them by responding that the allegation was \u201cabsurd\u201d and that \u201cshe truly [didn\u2019t] believe it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Ah5T\">\u00b620 Significantly, her responses corroborated other allegations against her. She admitted to calling her own employees \u201cbitch\u201d and \u201cdumb-ass.\u201d She also demonstrated a lack of understanding of general employment and labor law concepts. For example, she stood by her \u201chalf-hour rule,\u201d under which she and other managers claimed that if they worked at least one-half hour from home on a day where they were initially planning to use sick or vacation leave, they could instead be credited for having worked a full eight-hour day.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">\u00b621 Bird\u2019s briefing on the County\u2019s summary judgment motion and on appeal is similarly unpersuasive. Her assertion that she never had a performance-based warning, write-up, or reprimand does not, without more, raise an issue of fact as to whether she was discharged for good cause. <em>See Baumgart, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 29, 39 (concluding that an employer had good cause to discharge an employee even though the employee had \u201cexemplary performance evaluations\u201d). She also fails to address the December 2010 letter the Board sent her and the meetings individual Board members had with her to express concerns regarding their working relationship with her. The fact that one Board member did not agree with the decision to terminate Bird does not mean that the County lacked good cause for its decision. <em>See Sullivan, </em>\u00b6 27 (concluding that the \u201cfact that not every [company] employee complained about [the employee] failed to undermine the validity of\u2019 the employer\u2019s reasons for discharging the employee). The Dissent\u2019s emphasis on one Board member\u2019s disagreement with the decision to terminate Bird fails to recognize that county commissions make decisions every day on two-to-one votes. Dissent, \u00b6\u00b6 28-29. Bird\u2019s Complaint, naming the Board as the County\u2019s governing body, properly acknowledges that the County acts through its Board, not through individual commissioners. The Board member who disagreed with terminating Bird recognized that the other two Board members had the authority to terminate Bird. Such a disagreement does not create an issue of material fact. <em>See, e.g., Ternes v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co., </em>2011 MT 156, \u00b6 27, 361 Mont. 129, 257 P.3d 352 (concluding that \u201cmere disagreement about the interpretation of a fact or facts does not amount to genuine issues of material fact\u201d). Finally, the fact that the Policy and Procedures Manual needed to be updated prior to her employment does not refute that it was ultimately Bird\u2019s responsibility as Human Resources Director to update it. And Bird does not deny that her replacement updated the manual within a relatively short time of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>being on the job.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">\u00b622 Outside of these assertions, Bird simply proclaims that she disputes the County\u2019s \u201cproffered reasons for firing [her],\u201d that she disputes whether they \u201cwere the true reasons for firing\u201d her, and that the parties characterize the evidence differently. The County, however, presented specific evidence to show the reasons the Board decided to terminate her. The County submitted the depositions of two Board members and another County employee, the affidavit of one of the deputy County attorneys who investigated the allegations against Bird, and the various letters sent by the parties. As part of the investigation into the allegations, the County Attorney\u2019s office interviewed the five other department heads who co-signed the October 2012 letters to the Board and Bird\u2019s four subordinates in the human resources department. These interviews substantiated the initial allegations against Bird and raised new concerns that led to additional fact-finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">\u00b623 Bird, on the other hand, did not present material and substantial evidence that raises a genuine issue of material fact regarding many of the County\u2019s reasons for terminating her. F or instance, Bird does not point to evidence that refutes the County\u2019s claims that she improperly managed staff, implemented policies without the Board\u2019s formal approval, and failed to understand key aspects of her position. Nor has she presented evidence that these reasons for terminating her were \u201cfalse, whimsical, arbitrary or capricious.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>\u00b6 10. These are all reasons that have \u201csome logical relationship\u201d to the human services needs of the County and thus are legitimate business reasons for terminating Bird. <em>See Sullivan, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 17, 46; <em>Becker, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 24-30. The Commission\u2019s loss of trust in its Human Resources Director\u2019s ability to handle sensitive personnel matters, to work collaboratively to resolve workplace concerns, and to handle key aspects of her position in accordance with applicable law and policy is good cause for her termination. Bird\u2019s proffered evidence regarding the other reasons for her termination, and her characterization of that evidence, does \u201cnot render summary judgment inappropriate where there are facts <em>not </em>in dispute that provide \u2018good cause\u2019 for discharge from employment.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>\u00b6 14 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">\u00b624 The County presented evidence sufficient to show good cause for terminating Bird. It then became Bird\u2019s burden to present evidence sufficient to defeat the County\u2019s motion for summary judgment. An employer has a \u201cright to exercise [its] considerable discretion in determining whether [a managerial employee] possessed the required proficiencies to perform her job\u201d when the \u201cevidence that supports a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>non-pretextual reason for [the employee\u2019s] discharge is not disputed.\u201d <em>Baumgart, </em>\u00b6 39. As demonstrated above, the summary judgment evidence that Bird does not dispute supports a non-pretextual reason for her termination. Finally, even if Bird was singled out from the group of department heads who submitted letters to the Board, this does not demonstrate pretext. Rather, the letters support the County\u2019s assertion that Bird was unsuited to manage the Human Resources Department. Bird organized a group of department heads to collectively bargain for market pay adjustments. But the County noted in its termination letter that, as Human Resources Director, Bird was \u201cpresumably the one person in the group who is knowledgeable about pay and compensation,\u201d and she \u201cfail led I to understand the basic principle that management officials have no legal authority to bargain collectively.\u201d Further, the \u201cno confidence\u201d letter that Bird signed regarding only two of the three Board members also demonstrates a lack of professionalism and an unwillingness to engage in a \u201cmore collaborative approach to problem-solving\u201d\u2014an area of improvement identified in the Board\u2019s 2010 letter to Bird.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">\u00b625  Bird occupied a sensitive managerial position with the County administration, and the Board was entitled to expect her to perform with the trust and sensitivity commensurate with her responsibilities. The County\u2019s determination that Bird was not fulfilling her obligations is entitled to appropriate deference. <em>Sullivan, </em>\u00b6 18. It submitted evidence sufficient to meet its initial burden of showing good cause for her termination. Bird failed to respond with material and substantial evidence to raise genuine issues of material fact as to whether the County had legitimate business reasons for discharging her. Accordingly, we conclude that the District Court did not err in granting the County summary judgment on Bird\u2019s claim that the County terminated her employment without good cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">\u00b626 The District Court\u2019s judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b102-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES WHEAT and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b102-9\">JUSTICE SHEA,</author>\n<p id=\"AMC\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-10\">\u00b627 The Cascade County Board of Commissioners terminated Stacey Bird from her position as the County\u2019s Human Resources Director on a two-to-one vote. The dissenting Commissioner testified that he did not believe termination was warranted because, after reviewing the charges against Bird, and her responses to those charges, he found her responses to be \u201clogical\u201d and characterized the situation as \u201ckind of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>he said / she said on some of these things, [that] wasn\u2019t really definitive.\u201d It seems incongruous to say the least, therefore, that after drawing all reasonable inferences in Bird\u2019s favor, those same \u201che said / she said\u201d allegations that were not \u201creally definitive,\u201d such that one of the three individuals responsible for deciding Bird\u2019s fate concluded she should not be terminated, have in this Court\u2019s view constituted a complete absence of material fact justifying Bird\u2019s termination without even a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">\u00b628 The Court dismisses the fact that one of the three individuals who were responsible for making the decision to terminate Bird did not think she should be terminated by comparing this case to <em>Sullivan. </em>Opinion, \u00b6 21. This is not exactly an apples-to-apples comparison. In <em>Sullivan, </em>the plaintiff argued that he raised a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether his employer had good cause to terminate his employment because not every <em>employee </em>complained about his performance. <em>Sullivan, </em>\u00b6 27. Arguing issues of material fact because of a lack of unanimity among all of your subordinates and co-workers that you were bad at your job is hardly the equivalent of a two-to-one vote among the superiors responsible for terminating your employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">\u00b629 The Court contends that this Dissent fails to recognize that county commissions make decisions every day on two-to-one votes, and then illustrates its point with yet another inapt citation to the general proposition that \u201cmere disagreement about the interpretation of a fact or facts does not amount to genuine issues of material fact.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 21 (citing <em>Ternes, </em>\u00b6 27). Yet what the Court apparently fails to recognize is the obvious and fundamental difference between a mere disagreement <em>between opposing parties </em>about the interpretation of a fact or facts, and a disagreement among those responsible for making the decision to discharge an employee regarding the ultimate decision to discharge. One expects opposing parties to disagree\u2014that is, after all, what makes them opposing. However, the dissenting Commissioner\u2019s opinion that Bird should not have been discharged was not a \u201cmere disagreement about the interpretation of a fact or facts\u201d between opposing parties; it was effectively an admission by a party opponent. Is this alone sufficient to guarantee Bird\u2019s success at trial? Of course not. It is, however, sufficient\u2014when considered with the other circumstances of Bird\u2019s discharge\u2014to survive summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">\u00b630 Aside from the affirmative declaration of one of the three Commissioners that Bird should not have been discharged, equally problematic for me is reconciling the Court\u2019s resolution of this case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>with our recent decision in <em>Moe. </em>In <em>Moe, </em>we affirmed the District Court\u2019s denial of summary judgment because we concluded there were factual issues that precluded summary judgment in favor of the County. To begin with the facts that distinguish <em>Moe </em>from this case: (1) the plaintiffs name was Moe, not Bird; (2) the county\u2019s name was Silver Bow, not Cascade. Beyond those two distinguishing facts, the cases become startlingly similar.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">\u00b631 At the time that Moe was placed on administrative leave pending an investigation, she had been the human resources director for Silver Bow County for approximately four years. <em>Moe, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 4-5. At the time that Bird was placed on administrative leave pending an investigation, she had been the human resources director for Cascade County for approximately four years. Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 3, 6. The District Court in this case found that the County \u201cterminated Bird for failing to perform her job duties, insubordination, use of public property for private purposes, and disrespect to other employees.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 15. In <em>Moe, </em>the County \u201cterminated Moe\u2019s employment based on her failure to perform her job duties, disruption of County operations, and \u2018other legitimate business reasons.\u2019 \u201d <em>Moe, </em>\u00b6 51. The \u201cother legitimate business reasons\u201d Silver Bow County alleged for Moe\u2019s discharge included:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-6\">employee complaints regarding Moe\u2019s job performance and behavior, Moe\u2019s unresponsiveness to [Silver Bow County Chief Executive] Vincent\u2019s requests for further communication, Moe\u2019s failure to inform Vincent of potential wage claims\u2014including one in which Moe stood to gain the most significant financial benefit\u2014and Moe\u2019s participation in a conference call in her County office during working hours with an attorney who was representing the employees pursuing potential wage claims against the County.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b104-7\"><em>Moe, </em>\u00b6 51.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-8\">\u00b632 The Court distinguishes this case from <em>Moe </em>by stating that the employee in <em>Moe </em>\u201cpresented exhaustive responses to the allegations against her,\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 18 (quoting Moe, \u00b6 62), whereas, in the Court\u2019s view, \u201cthe majority of Bird\u2019s responses amount to conclusory statements, speculative assertions, and mere denials.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 19 (quoting <em>Moe, </em>\u00b6 63) (internal quotation marks omitted). The Court then provides a handful of examples it contends demonstrate the inadequacy of Bird\u2019s response. Opinion, \u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-9\">\u00b633 The Court\u2019s first example is Bird\u2019s response to the County\u2019s charge that she disclosed confidential information regarding an employee\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>pay. Opinion, \u00b6 19. In its due process letter, the County alleged that Bird had access to this private information in her capacity as human resources director and then \u201cdisclosed [this] constitutionally protected information.\u201d As the Court notes, Bird responded to this charge by stating that she had not breached any confidential information, because the employee had publicly discussed the information, so it was no longer confidential. Opinion, \u00b6 19. This is a curious example of one of Bird\u2019s inadequate responses because, although this Court finds the response inadequate, in its termination letter the County \u201cconfirmed [Bird\u2019s] assertion.\u201d Having confirmed Bird\u2019s assertion, the County then moved the goalpost from a charge of \u201cdi.sclo.sl ing I constitutionally protected information,\u201d to a conviction of being \u201cdiscourteous and disrespectful, in violation of Personnel Policy Manual paragraph 40.3.\u201d So having successfully refuted the charge of disclosing constitutionally protected information, Bird was found guilty of a different charge, in violation of a Personnel Policy Manual provision that was not cited as a basis for discharge in the now ironically named \u201cdue process\u201d letter. Yet this specific violation\u2014that Bird was never afforded the opportunity to respond to\u2014provided part of the basis for her termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">\u00b634 Bird prefaced her response to the County\u2019s due process letter with the statement: \u201cI am at a distinct disadvantage by not having access to my manuals and files to provide a comprehensive and thorough response with dates and full and accurate information. I will be providing information to the best of my ability to recall the facts.\u201d With that disadvantage being noted, Bird then proceeded to respond to the County\u2019s allegations, literally paragraph-by-paragraph, over the course of her six-page, single-spaced response. Although this Court found Bird\u2019s response to be inadequate, as noted above the dissenting Commissioner found her responses \u201clogical\u201d and sufficient for him to vote against terminating Bird\u2019s employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">\u00b635 Finally, I disagree with the District Court\u2019s conclusion of \u201cno evidence that [the] County\u2019s reasons for [Bird\u2019s] termination are pretextual or dishonest.\u201d Bird was placed on administrative leave and noticed up for an investigation exactly one week after she and the other department heads declined to meet with the Commissioners individually regarding their requested market pay adjustments. Both the due process letter and the termination letter leave little doubt that it was this activity that precipitated the initial action taken against Bird. The three principal allegations against Bird\u2014(1) using public time, facilities, equipment, and personnel in an attempt to influence the outcome of the November 6, 2012 election; (2) disclosing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>confidential information to the public; and (3) disclosing confidential information acquired in the course of official duties to further her personal economic interests\u2014all are based on the drafting of, and information contained in, the October 12, 2012 and October 19, 2012 letters requesting market pay adjustments. Bird asserted that she was being singled out for discipline to make an example of her, and pointed out that none of the other department heads who signed the letters were subject to discipline. While the fact that none of the other department heads were subject to discipline is not dispositive that Bird was singled out, it does give rise to a reasonable inference that the letters, in and of themselves, did not provide a basis for discharge; otherwise, all the signatories would have been subject to the same disciplinary action as Bird, unless the basis for the action against her was \u201cfalse, whimsical, arbitrary, or capricious.\u201d <em>See Davis, </em>\u00b6 10. This then requires scrutiny of the three stated bases that are ostensibly unique to Bird\u2019s conduct relative to the creation and distribution of the two letters.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">\u00b636 As to the first alleged basis\u2014using public time, facilities, equipment, and personnel in an attempt to influence the outcome of the November 6, 2012 election\u2014the two commissioners who voted for Bird\u2019s termination acknowledged that the October 12 and October 19 letters were created during off-duty hours. They further acknowledged Bird\u2019s response that she \u201cand the other Department Heads worked to ensure that the use of e-mail was a \u2018personal limited use,\u2019 which is allowed by policy.\u201d While conceding that \u201cCounty policy allows the limited use of e-mail for personal use,\u201d the Commissioners pointed out that County policy does not allow the use of computer systems for campaign purposes, and they asserted this was the real motivation for drafting the letters, based on their subjective credibility findings of Bird and other witnesses interviewed on the subject, from which they concluded, \u201cthat [Bird\u2019s] response is not credible.\u201d While it is possible that Bird and the other County department heads who signed the October 12 and October 19 letters were motivated by a grand design to influence the November 6, 2012 election, as the two Commissioners subjectively concluded, is there not at least an equal possibility that Bird\u2019s request for a pay raise was just that\u2014a request for a pay raise? Sure, I guess Bird\u2019s actions could have all been part of some grand \u201cOctober Surprise\u201d conspiracy, but is there not at least a reasonable inference that Bird is one of those wacky employees who just wanted to make more money? Far more troubling than the Court\u2019s inclination to hear hoofbeats and think of zebras, though, is the acceptance of one party\u2019s subjective finding that the opposing party is not credible as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>being sufficient to establish an absence of material fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">\u00b637 Regarding the second and third principal allegations\u2014disclosing confidential information to the public and disclosing confidential information acquired in the course of official duties to further Bird\u2019s personal economic interests\u2014as noted above, Dissent, \u00b6 33, the County morphed those allegations into a conclusion that Bird was \u201cdiscourteous and disrespectful, in violation of Personnel Policy Manual paragraph 40.3.\u201d Aside from the obvious due process implications of basing a discharge on an alleged violation to which an employee was never afforded the opportunity to respond, such a malleable basis for discipline should at least give rise to an inference that the originally stated basis for discharge was pretextual.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">\u00b638 The County levels several other allegations against Bird that it contends arose \u201c[i]n the course of\u2019 reviewing the three principal allegations. These are: improper management of staff; implementing policies without formal approval or, if approved, not implementing them consistently; and failure to understand key aspects of her position as human resources director. In sustaining these allegations against Bird, the County again largely relied on the subjective credibility determinations of the two Commissioners who voted for Bird\u2019s discharge. For example, regarding the allegation that Bird mismanaged her staff, she responded: \u201cI find this [allegation] absurd and truly don\u2019t believe it.\u201d Bird then provided examples of her staffs statements and conduct that she contended belied the allegation. In the termination letter, the two Commissioners sustained the allegation by stating at the outset: \u201c[Y]ou \u2018truly don\u2019t believe it.\u2019 However, we do.\u201d The two Commissioners then noted that they \u201cfind credible\u201d an unidentified employee\u2019s report concerning a statement Bird allegedly made about a third employee. This again is what caused the dissenting Commissioner to find that the situation was a \u201che said / she said\u201d but what this Court concludes to be an absence of material fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">\u00b639 Finally, the Court concludes that \u201ceven if Bird was singled out from the group of department heads who submitted letters to the Board, this does not demonstrate pretext.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 24. The Court arrives at this conclusion because it characterizes the two letters, signed by the six department heads, as organizing a collective bargaining unit, which supported the County\u2019s assertion that Bird was unsuited for her job because she should have understood this was not allowed. Opinion, \u00b6 24. To be clear, this \u201ccollective bargaining\u201d process commenced with a letter that begins: \u201cThis is being respectfully submitted in accordance with Cascade County Policy Section 40.6 Problem Solving Process, bringing our problems and concerns to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>management.\u201d The letter then concludes by requesting a meeting with the Commissioners to discuss why two department heads received pay raises while six others did not. In other words, these six department heads requested a sit-down, pursuant to Cascade County policy, to discuss what they perceived as disparate treatment in their ranks. This was not Bird standing on a table in the commission chambers, holding up a piece of cardboard with \u201cUNION\u201d scrawled across it.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Did Bird\u2019s activities demonstrate a \u201cfaillure I to understand the basic principle that management officials have no legal authority to bargain collectively,\u201d justifying Bird\u2019s termination, as this Court concludes? Opinion, \u00b6 24. Or has the County mischaracterized Bird\u2019s activity as a pretext for her termination? That might have been an interesting question for a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">\u00b640 Finally, the Court concludes that the \u201cno confidence\u201d letter that Bird signed regarding only two of the three Board members also demonstrates a lack of professionalism and an unwillingness to engage in a \u201cmore collaborative approach to problem-solving.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 24. This is a troubling conclusion, because it appears to endorse the idea that a public employee who criticizes an elected official could be subject to discipline, and even termination, based on the premise that the employee was unprofessional and lacked a \u201cmore collaborative approach to problem-solving.\u201d I trust the Court is not suggesting that a public employee, even a department head, forfeits her right to engage in public discourse by virtue of her employment. Equally troubling is the Court\u2019s failure to recognize that the two Board members who were the subject of the \u201cno confidence\u201d vote were the same two Board members who voted to terminate Bird\u2019s employment. This is not to suggest that these two Board members were, in fact, motivated by the no confidence vote to terminate Bird\u2019s employment, merely that a reasonable inference can be drawn from this fact that the termination was pretextual.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">1 \u00b641 There is little question that the County\u2019s initial action against Bird was precipitated by the letters, signed by her and the other department heads, seeking an increase in pay. Regardless of what precipitated the County\u2019s action against Bird, I agree that there is a case to be made that Bird\u2019s performance as human resources director was deficient in some respects. Regardless of these performance issues, however, there is at least a reasonable inference that if Bird had never attempted to get a raise, she would still be working as Cascade <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>County\u2019s human resources director, and that her termination was pretextual. Irrespective of the pretext issue, there also is a legitimate question as to whether Bird\u2019s performance warranted termination or, as the dissenting Commissioner testified, some lower level of discipline. The ultimate question of whether Bird\u2019s discharge was motivated by, or merely precipitated by, her attempts to get a pay raise is a question for a jury to decide. It is not a question that is susceptible to summary disposition. Therefore I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b108-7\"><em> Norma Rae </em>(20th Century Fox 1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
