We affirm, and state the issue as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-27\"><em>Did the District Court err by extending D.L.B.\u2019s commitment to the Nursing Care </em>Center?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b205-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">\u00b62 D.L.B. is a 75-year-old male who, unfortunately, has suffered from mental illness his entire adult life. He was originally diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia after his first psychotic episode, at age 22. Since this initial diagnosis, D.L.B. has been involuntarily committed to mental hospitals throughout his life. D.L.B.\u2019s May 2015 Mental Health Assessment for Recommitment states that he has been involuntarily committed to mental health hospitals at least six times and that other \u201c[rjecords indicate [that] he [has] likely had other psychiatric hospitalizations through the years, but [complete] information is not available.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> D.L.B.\u2019s lastfour hospital commitments, in 2004, 2011, 2012, and 2014, were to the Montana State Hospital (MSH).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">\u00b63 D.L.B.\u2019s psychosis centers around a fear of the Nazis and of being persecuted by them. He also suffers from delusions regarding an imaginary wife and children who reside in Canada. Critically, he has a pervasive history of medication noncompliance arising from his belief that he does not suffer from a mental illness.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">\u00b64 D.L.B.\u2019s 53-year history of mental illness evidences a relatively predictable and cyclical pattern, typically beginning with a psychotic episode. During these episodes, he acts out and is a physical danger to himself, as well as to others. The episodes typically result in an involuntary commitment of D.L.B. to a mental health hospital, where he is medicated and begins to stabilize. After improving, D.L.B. is transferred from the hospital to a mental health nursing care facility, where supervision helps him to stay on his medication and maintain stability. After he is released from the mental health nursing care facility to a community based rehabilitation center or treatment program, he typically stops taking his medicine, leading to another psychotic episode and a repeat of the cycle.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">\u00b65 At the July 8, 2015, recommitment hearing, the District Court verbally summarized D.L.B.\u2019s condition as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-9\">[D.L.B.] does suffer from a mental disorder that being paranoid schizophrenia which in his case causes him to have a lack of insight in to his own mental disorders and how those affect him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>and leads to a persistent desire and a pattern of medication refusal and removing himself from the medication which then causes his mental disorder to spiral out of control and causes [D.L.B.] to decompensate and have to start over again with his treatment. This presents a danger to [D.L.B.] as each and every time he has to start over it takes more and more to get him back to normal and during those psychotic episodes he\u2019s a danger to himself and could be a danger to others just basically due to his lack of insight and ability to control himself.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">\u00b66 In 2014, D.L.B. was living at a rehabilitative center in Dillon when he again refused to take his medicine. He decompensated to the point that he \u201cbelieved staff at the facility were contracting with the Nazi\u2019s [sic] to torture him and inflict pain on him with infrared devices.\u201d He became verbally aggressive and attempted to physically strike the staff, leading to his commitment to MSH on September 23, 2014. On March 24, 2015, after he had stabilized, D.L.B. was transferred from MSH to the Nursing Care Center. Based on his behaviors, however, D.L.B. was considered an elopement risk. At the Nursing Care Center, D.L.B. received regular medical and psychiatric care. Despite this care, D.L.B. continued to have visual hallucinations and paranoid delusions, be verbally and physically aggressive toward the staff, refuse to take his medication, and isolate himself. On June 2, 2015, the State filed the subject petition to extend D.L.B.\u2019s commitment to the Nursing Care Center for further evaluation and treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">\u00b67 In support of the petition, the State submitted a report by Susan Stevens (Stevens), a Mental Health Professional.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Stevens\u2019 report explained that D.L.B. had a long history of medication noncompliance and, consequently, a recurring inability to successfully live independently in community-based placements, despite his receipt of supportive services. She also opined that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-6\">[A]s a result of [D.L.B.\u2019s] mental illness he presents as a danger to self and potentially others when he is medication non-compliant. Commitment proceedings should not be dismissed. [D.L.B.] presents as a danger to self due to florid psychosis (delusions and hallucinations). He has an extensive history of becoming medication non-compliant then decompensates very <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>quickly and becomes confused and unable to meet and maintain his most basic needs of food, clothing, shelter, health, and safety. He potentially presents as a danger to others due to his recent history of becoming verbally and physically aggressive towards others.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">\u00b68 On July 8,2015, an adjudicatory hearing was held at the Nursing Care Center. Debbie Moore (Moore), Director of Nursing at the Center, testified that D.L.B. continued to exhibit characteristic behaviors of paranoid schizophrenia such as auditory hallucinations, delusions, false beliefs that people were plotting against him, and delusions of grandeur. While noting that D.L.B. was \u201cbeginning to do well,\u201d she stated that he continued to deny the need for medication and to make statements about not wanting to take medication. Moore opined that D.L.B. continued to meet the admission criteria for the Nursing Care Center based on his continued delusions, paranoid thoughts, and a lack of judgment and insight into his mental health needs. Stevens testified that the Nursing Care Center was a lesser restrictive environment than D.L.B.\u2019s prior placement at MSH, and opined that D.L.B. was not yet ready for a less restrictive, community based placement. At the conclusion of the hearing, the District Court orally extended D.L.B.\u2019s commitment to the Nursing Care Center for a period of not more than six months. A written order was entered on July 16, 2015, which did not specify under what statutory provisions D.L.B. was being recommitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">\u00b69 D.L.B. appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">\u00b610 We review commitment orders to determine whether a district court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous and its conclusions of law are correct. <em>In re S.G.R., </em>2016 MT 70, \u00b6 13, 383 Mont. 74, 368 P.3d 1180 (citing <em>In re S.M., </em>2014 MT 309, \u00b6 13, 377 Mont. 133, 339 P.3d 23). A finding of fact is clearly erroneous if it is not supported by substantial evidence, if the district court misapprehended the effect of the evidence or if, after a review of the entire record, we are left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake had been made. <em>In re S.G.R., </em>\u00b6 13 (citing <em>In re Mental Health of L.K.-S., </em>2011 MT 21, \u00b6 14, 359 Mont. 191, 247 P.3d 1100 [hereinafter <em>In re L.K.-S.]). </em>Whether a district court\u2019s findings of fact meet statutory requirements is a question of law that we review for correctness. <em>In re S.</em>G.R., \u00b6 13 (citing <em>In re L.L.A., </em>2011 MT 285, \u00b6 6, 362 Mont. 464, 267 P.3d 1).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">\u00b611 <em>Did the District Court err by extending D.L.B.\u2019s commitment to the Nursing Care </em>Center?</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">\u00b612 Arguing that Montana\u2019s involuntary commitment statutes require that a recommitment meet the identical standards of an original commitment, D.L.B. contends that the District Court\u2019s findings are insufficient to satisfy the commitment criteria under \u00a7 53-21-126(l)(a), (b), or (c), MCA, and that the evidence satisfies recommitment only under \u00a7 53-21-126(l)(d),MCA. Commitments ordered pursuant to \u00a7 53-21-126(l)(d), MCA, may only be made \u201cto a community facility or program or an appropriate course of treatment... and may not require commitment at the state hospital, a behavioral health inpatient facility, or the Montana medical health nursing care center.\u201d Section 53-21-127(7), MCA. D.L.B. thus argues that his recommitment to the Lewistown Nursing Care Center violates these provisions. In essence, D.L.B. asserts that these statutes must be narrowly interpreted and that the criteria stated in \u00a7 53-21-126(l)(a)-(d), MCA, are the only appropriate considerations in determining whether recommitment should be ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">\u00b613 The State responds that the \u00a7 53-21-126(1), MCA, criteria must be evaluated in the context of a recommitment. Noting that this statute states that, when \u201cdetermining whether the respondent requires commitment and the appropriate disposition. ..., the court <em>shall consider\u201d </em>the listed criteria, the State argues the statute does not prohibit consideration of additional circumstances related to a respondent, including, in a recommitment proceeding, a respondent\u2019s relevant medical history and continuing treatment requirements. Section 53-21-126(1), MCA (emphasis added). The State contends that, when placed in this context, the District Court\u2019s findings are sufficient to support recommitment.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">\u00b614 Section 53-21-128(1), MCA, provides that \u201c[n]ot less than 2 weeks\u201d before the expiration of a commitment, the professional person in charge of the patient at the place of commitment may petition the district court \u201cfor extension of the commitment period.\u201d The same hearing procedures used for an initial commitment are followed in a recommitment proceeding, except the respondent is not entitled to a jury trial. Section 53-21-128(l)(c), MCA. If the district court \u201cfinds that the patient continues to suffer from a mental disorder and to require commitment, the court shall order commitment as set forth in \u00a7 53-21-127.\u201d Section 53-21-128(l)(d), MCA. In turn, \u00a7 53-21-127(7), MCA, governs dispositional hearings, commitment options, least restrictive alternatives, and necessary findings of fact to be made by the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>court, and provides that \u201c|.s latisfaction of any one of the criteria listed in \u00a7 53-21-126(1) justifies commitment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">\u00b615 In relevant part, \u00a7 53-21-126(1), MCA, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-6\">In determining whether the respondent requires commitment and the appropriate disposition under 53-21-127, the court shall consider the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-7\">(a) whether the respondent, because of a mental disorder, is substantially unable to provide for the respondent\u2019s own basic needs of food, clothing, shelter, health, or safety;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-8\">(b) whether the respondent has recently, because of a mental disorder and through an act or an omission, caused self-injury or injury to others;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-9\">(c) whether, because of a mental disorder, there is an imminent threat of injury to the respondent or to others because of the respondent\u2019s acts or omissions; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-10\">(d) whether the respondent\u2019s mental disorder, as demonstrated by the respondent\u2019s recent acts or omissions, will, if untreated, predictably result in deterioration of the respondent\u2019s mental condition to the point at which the respondent will become a danger to self or to others or will be unable to provide for the respondent\u2019s own basic needs of food, clothing, shelter, health, or safety.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b209-11\">As noted by D.L.B., if the court relies solely upon the criterion provided in subsection (l)(d), \u201cthe court may require commitment only to a community facility or program,\u201d and not \u201cthe Montana mental health nursing care center.\u201d Section 53-21-127(7), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-12\">\u00b616 The recommitment statute, \u00a7 53-21-128, MCA, incorporates the procedures and standards for commitment provided in \u00a7\u00a7 53-21-126 and -127, MCA, but states the inquiry is whether the respondent \u201ccontinues to suffer\u201d from a mental disorder and continues \u201cto require commitment.\u201d Section 53-21-128(1)(d), MCA. The recommitment statute thus includes a time component, which requires a determination of whether the respondent\u2019s condition has improved, since his original commitment, to the point where he no longer suffers from a mental disorder requiring commitment. The inquiry can include consideration of the respondent\u2019s medical history, the original commitment proceeding, the treatment received since the original commitment, as well as the respondent\u2019s current status and treatment needs. While the stated legal standards for recommitment are the same as in an original commitment proceeding, the record and necessary considerations may not be. Further, the longer-term view called for by the recommitment statute permits an additional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>perspective of the evidence. Of course, respondents are not bound by their past medical histories, but histories and continuing treatment requirements are relevant considerations in the recommitment context.</p>\n<p id=\"AkO0\">\u00b617 Unfortunately, in its Order for Recommitment, the District Court neglected to cite in its findings and conclusions to the particular criteria under \u00a7 53-21-126(1), MCA, upon which it based D.L.B.\u2019s recommitment to the Nursing Care Center, a problem we have previously highlighted. <em>See generally, e.g., In re B.D., </em>2015 MT 339, \u00b6 8, 381 Mont. 505, 362 P.3d 636 (the District Court\u2019s \u201cfailure to specify the subsection relied upon [for commitment] was clearly an oversight to be avoided.\u201d). Similarly, we have noted the paucity of written findings in commitment orders, which we are again presented with in this case. <em>See generally, e.g., In re M.P.-L., </em>2015 MT 338, \u00b6 20, 381 Mont. 496, 362 P.3d 627 (concluding that while \u201cthe District Court\u2019s written findings are bare-boned,\u201d they provided \u201csufficient reasoning to justify the commitment.\u201d). We have looked to a court\u2019s oral findings to supplement its written findings, <em>In re </em>S.M., \u00b6 27, and have applied the doctrine of implied findings that were necessary to the court\u2019s determination. <em>In re S.M., </em>\u00b6 28; <em>In re M.P.-L, </em>\u00b6 20; <em>In re S.G.R., </em>\u00b6 21. However, we will \u201cdecline to expand the doctrine of implied facts to the degree necessary to affirm a commitment order that is beyond \u2018hare-bones\u2019 and \u2018spartan.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re C.C., </em>2016 MT 174, \u00b6 23, 384 Mont. 135, 376 P.3d 105. These holdings underscore the necessity of \u201cstrict adherence\u201d by district courts with the statutory requirements governing involuntary commitment proceedings, despite the commonly urgent nature of the proceedings, <em>In re L.K.-S., </em>\u00b6 15, including the entry of findings of fact. Section 53-21-127(8), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">\u00b618 Our review of the record leads to the conclusion that the District Court\u2019s findings of fact establish a need for continued commitment to the Nursing Care Center under \u00a7 53-21-126(1)(a), MCA. D.L.B. \u201ccontinues to suffer,\u201d \u00a7 53-21-128(1)(d), MCA, from a mental disorder that renders him \u201csubstantially unable to provide for [his] own basic needs of food, clothing, shelter, health, or safety.\u201d Section 53-21-126(1)(a), MCA. The District Court\u2019s oral findings determined that D.L.B. continues to suffer from paranoid schizophrenia, causing him to \u201chave a lack of insight in to his own mental disorders\u201d and a lack of \u201cability to control himself,\u201d including a continuing \u201cmedication refusal\u201d that has not resolved, even with current treatment. The record includes a May 28, 2015 Mental Health Assessment for Recommitment, which noted D.L.B. has continuing problems with hallucinations and paranoid delusions along with verbal and physical aggressiveness toward staff, including:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>05/19/15 When [D.L.B.] asked why he had to be here Dr. Whitworth stated \u2018because you are mentally ill\u2019.

[]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">(Internal punctuation original; emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b211-9\">\u00b619 Consistent with this evidence, the District Court\u2019s written findings state that D.L.B. continues to suffer from paranoid schizophrenia, and cites Stevens\u2019 testimony that D.L.B. \u201cis a danger to himself due to his lack of insight....\u201d Stevens\u2019 report stated \u201c[D.L.B.] presents as a danger to self due to florid psychosis (delusions and hallucinations) .... He potentially presents as a danger to others due to his recent history of becoming verbally and physically aggressive toward others,\u201d which we can add to the District Court\u2019s findings by implication. <em>In re </em>S.M., \u00b6 28. The District Court found \u201cthe most appropriate and least restrictive placement for [D.L.B.] is the Montana Mental Health Nursing Center,\u201d and the treatment plan filed with the District Court was appropriate, subject to \u201cregular review.\u201d The District Court authorized involuntary administration of medication to D.L.B., finding that \u201che is unable to appreciate the necessity for a proper medication regimen to control his mental illness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A55\">\u00b620  Although the District Court\u2019s findings were sparse, we conclude they were sufficient to support a conclusion that recommitment to the Nursing Care Center was authorized under \u00a7\u00a7 53-23-128(l)(d) and 53-21-126(l)(a), MCA. Despite treatment, D.L.B.\u2019s condition has not sufficiently improved, since his original commitment, to the point where he no longer suffers from a mental disorder requiring commitment.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>\u00b621 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b212-5\">JUSTICES WHEAT, BAKER and SHEA concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b205-10\"> The record also includes an October 2015 Mental Health Assessment for Recommitment that was filed with the District Court on December 18, 2015, as part of a subsequent recommitment proceeding that led to the filing of another recommitment order.

Again, this Court combs the transcript to \u201cimply\u201d both factual findings and conclusions of law, despite the statute clearly requiring \u201ca detailed statement of the facts upon which the court found the respondent to be suffering from a mental disorder and requiring commitment[.]\u201d Section 53-21-127(8)(a), MCA. We have often \u201cstressed the critical importance of strict compliance with the statutory requirements addressing involuntary commitment.\u201d <em>In re C.C., </em>\u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-8\">\u00b623 Here, the statutory language of Montana\u2019s involuntary commitment statute requires that an extension of a commitment meet the standards of an original commitment. <em>See </em>\u00a7 53-21-126(1), MCA (providing that for an original commitment the court must determine the person suffers from a mental disorder and \u201crequires commitment\u201d); \u00a7 53-21-128(l)(d), MCA (providing that for an extended commitment the court must determine the person continues to suffer from a mental disorder and to \u201crequire commitment\u201d). Thus, the statutory criteria to grant the original commitment under \u00a7 53-21-126(1), MCA, also applies to an extension of a commitment pursuant to \u00a7 53-21-128(l)(d), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"AgW\">\u00b624 Section 53-21-126(1), MCA, explains that \u201crequiring commitment\u201d means the court consider whether there is sufficient evidence of at least one of the four criteria which result from the person\u2019s mental disorder. In my opinion, for the simple reason that the statutory provisions are plain and that involuntary commitment statutes are to be strictly construed, this Court errs when it adds to the four criteria which justify commitment by including a \u201ctime component.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 16. The Legislature has indicated that both initial commitments and recommitments are not <em>proforma </em>proceedings. Even where the initial confinement of an individual was constitutionally permissible, the confinement may not constitutionally continue if the reasons for the initial confinement no longer exist. <em>See O\u2019Connor v. Donaldson, </em>422 U.S. 563, 574-75, 95 S. Ct. 2486, 2493 (\u201cNor is it enough that [the respondent\u2019s] original confinement was founded upon a constitutionally adequate basis, if in fact it was, because even if his involuntary confinement was initially permissible, it could not constitutionally continue after that basis no longer existed.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>\u00b625 Here, we have no indication from this Court\u2019s opinion or the District Court\u2019s order which statutory criteria were satisfied making it necessary to recommitment D.L.B. I therefore would reverse the District Court\u2019s order of commitment, based upon the foregoing and the analysis I set forth more thoroughly in <em>In re S.G.R., </em>\u00b6\u00b6 26-31 (McKinnon J., dissenting). To the extent we hold otherwise, I dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
