We affirm and address the following issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-23\"><em>Did the District Court err by ordering a reduction in the support obligation for the parties\u2019 </em>child?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b63-24\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b63-25\">\u00b62 This appeal is part of an ongoing parenting and child support proceeding that has continuously been before the District Court since 2004. April and Jason have a minor son together, known in these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>proceedings as K.A.S. Primary custody, physical time, and child support for K.A.S. have changed several times since 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">\u00b63 On September 3, 2014, April and Jason entered into the current parenting plan, which assigned to April the primary physical custody of K.A.S. The plan provided that \u201c[cjhild support shall be paid as ordered by the Child Support Enforcement Division [(CSED)].\u201d April petitioned CSED for recalculation of the child support obligation between the two parents. The CSED proceeding was limited to recalculating the child support based upon the change in parenting time under the new agreement, and other evidence about the parties\u2019 situation was not considered. CSED issued a final order on June 11, 2015, eliminating April\u2019s $48 monthly support obligation and imposing a $679 monthly support obligation on Jason. Jason was also ordered to pay an arrearage of approximately $2,000 in $104 monthly installments, setting his new child support payment at $783 per month.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">\u00b64 On July 15, 2015, Jason filed a motion for judicial modification of the CSED order. Alleginghe lacked sufficient resources to pay $679 per month, Jason requested a reduction to $200 per month. Jason is married and resides near his place of employment with his wife, Angela, and their four children (in addition to K.A.S.). Three of those children are Angela\u2019s that Jason has adopted, and the fourth child is Jason and Angela\u2019s together. Angela has historically contributed between $1,000 and $1,900 per month to the family income from her part-time employment as a nurse, with the specific monthly amount depending upon the medical facility\u2019s need for her services. However, Angela\u2019s 12-year-old son has significant health issues, and the licensed psychologist treating the boy advised her to quit her nursing job, which she did in March of 2015. The District Court found that these health issues were \u201cnot likely to change in the immediately foreseeable future.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">\u00b65 At the hearing on the motion, Jason presented evidence concerning his current income and his family\u2019s monthly household expenses, including mortgage, home utilities, clothing, food, educational expenses, vehicle fuel and maintenance, insurance, and medical bills. Jason testified, and the District Court found, that he and Angela \u201chave had to borrow money from respective family members to assist with meeting their monthly expenses and are making $50.00 per month payments to maintain these loans.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b64-8\">\u00b66 The District Court concluded that, while Jason\u2019s child support is correctly calculated to be $679 per month under the CSED guidelines, the \u201cchange in circumstances noted herein give good and justifiable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>reason to vary from those guidelines.\u201d The court determined that, with \u201cbudgeting and appropriate adjustment of monthly expenses,\u201d Jason would be able to pay $200 per month in child support. The District Court ordered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-5\">Effective July 15,2015 (the date Jason filed his motion to modify), Jason\u2019s child support obligation to April is reduced to $200.00 per month. Should the health condition of the 12 year old minor child of Jason and Angela change so Angela can obtain either full-time or part-time employment, this reduced child support obligation shall again be reviewed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">The District Court ordered that the reduced child support obligation was \u201ccontingent upon Jason providing April, not less than annually, with a verified statement (i.e., under oath) generally describingthe 12-year-old\u2019s health condition and its impact on Angela\u2019s employability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">\u00b67 A district court\u2019s decision on modification of child support is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>In re Marriage of Carter-Scanlon, </em>2016 MT 190, \u00b6 8, 384 Mont. 273, 378 P.3d 1157 <em>(citing In re Marriage of Wilson, </em>2009 MT 203, \u00b6 12, 351 Mont. 204, 210 P.3d 170); <em>Simpson v. Simpson, </em>2013 MT 22, \u00b6 15, 368 Mont. 315, 294 P.3d 1212. A court abuses its discretion if it acts arbitrarily without conscientious judgment or exceeds the bounds of reason, resulting in substantial injustice. <em>Brown v. Brown, </em>2016 MT 299, \u00b6 11, 385 Mont. 369, 384 P.3d 476 (citing <em>In re Marriage of Pearson, </em>1998 MT 236, \u00b6 30, 291 Mont. 101, 965 P.2d 268); <em>Simpson, </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b65-10\">\u00b68 <em>Did the District Court err by ordering a reduction in the support obligation for the parties\u2019 </em>child?</p>\n<p id=\"b65-11\">\u00b69 April argues that the District Court erred (1) by concluding there was a change in circumstances, because Jason only testified to a loss of $175 per month in his income andCSED did not use Angela\u2019s income in its child support calculations; and (2) by failing to determine that the reduction was in the child\u2019s best interest under the factors in \u00a7 40-4-212, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-12\">\u00b610 \u201cIn determining child support obligations, a district court must follow the [CSED guidelines] unless clear and convincing evidence demonstrates that their application is unjust or inappropriate in that particular case.\u201d <em>In re Marriage of Frick, </em>2011 MT 41, \u00b6 21, 359 Mont. 296, 249 P.3d 67 (citing \u00a7 40-4-204(3)(a), MCA). \u201cWhenever a court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>issues <em>or modifies </em>an order concerning child support, the court shall determine the child support obligation by applying the standards in this section and the uniform child support [CSED] guidelines Section 40-4-204(3), MCA (emphasis added). The amount of support calculated pursuant to the CSED guidelines \u201cis presumed to be an adequate and reasonable support award, unless the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the application of the standards and guidelines is unjust... to any of the parties or that it is inappropriate in that particular case.\u201d Section 40-4-204(3)(a), MCA. While April cites to the best interest standards in \u00a7\u00a7 40-4-212 and -219, MCA, those statutes apply to a court\u2019s determination or modification of a \u201cparenting plan.\u201d Sections 40-4-212(1), 40-4-219(1), MCA. Modification of child support is addressed in \u00a7\u00a7 40-4-204 and -208, MCA. Specifically, when a court is considering the imposition or modification of child support, it is to \u201cdetermine the child support obligation by applying the standards\u201d set forth in \u00a7 40-4-204, MCA, and the CSED guidelines. Section 40-4-204(3)(a), MCA. The statutory standards include, among other factors, \u201cthe financial resources of the parents\u201d and \u201cthe needs of any person, other than the child, whom either parent is legally obligated to support.\u201d Section 40-4-204(2)(b), (h), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"aq-dedup-0\">\u00b611 Although April argues that Jason testified to a loss of only $175 per month, this argument ignores, as the CSED proceeding likewise ignored, the situation created in Jason\u2019s household by his son\u2019s significant illness, including that this medical condition required Angela to quit her job, which had provided a substantial amount of the family\u2019s monthly income. While the CSED proceeding did not consider Angela\u2019s income, the District Court found that this loss contributed to a budgetary shortfall such that Jason\u2019s income could not meet his household expenses while also paying the CSED-determined support obligation, and that he had to borrow money to meet monthly expenses. The District Court found that, with \u201cbudgeting and appropriate adjustment of monthly expenses,\u201d Jason would be able to pay $200 per month in child support. The court also found that April was not always using \u201cin network\u201d medical providers or the Indian Health Service, for which K.A.S. was eligible, to obtain lower cost or free medical services, and ordered April to do so, reasoning that the parties \u201ccannot afford to incur health care expense for the child when that expense could reasonably be covered by insurance or benefits available to the child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A-\">\u00b612  Sufficient evidence was presented to support the District Court\u2019s findings and to demonstrate that the CSED-determined obligation would be \u201cunjust ... to any of the parties or that it is inappropriate in that particular case.\u201d Section 40-4-204(3)(a), MCA. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>The District Court has presided over this proceeding for over 10 years and was well acquainted with the parties and their circumstances. Its order tied the new monthly obligation to developments regarding care of Jason and Angela\u2019s son, including reporting and future review of the issue. We conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A5\">\u00b613 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b67-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES BAKER, WHEAT and McKINNON concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b67-6\"> Although the District Court\u2019s order referenced CSED\u2019s assessment upon Jason of $104 per month for payment of a support arrearage, it is unclear from the order whether the court reduced Jason\u2019s total payment of $783 per month, or reduced only the current guideline calculation of $679 per month, down to $200 per month. We do not reach that issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
