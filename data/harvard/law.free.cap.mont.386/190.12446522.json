Mulroy\u2019s motion for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>summary judgment that an attorney\u2019s lien recorded by Morgan Pierce against real property Mulroy purchased from Morgan Pierce\u2019s client, Sheri Lee, is invalid. We address the following dispositive issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-5\">\n<em>Whether the District Court erred in holding that the signed fee agreement between Morgan Pierce and Lee did not create a lien by consent.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">\u00b62 We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b215-8\">\u00b63 In December 2014, Lee hired Morgan Pierce, a Missoula-based law firm, to represent her in a bankruptcy proceeding. Lee and Morgan Pierce entered into a fee agreement, which provided, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AzW1\">If Client has any legal interest in any real estate when the bankruptcy petition is filed, Client agrees and understands that Attorney\u2019s post-petition services will benefit that real estate. Therefore, Client acknowledges and consents to Attorney\u2019s Lien on such property, and consents to the post-petition filing of a Notice of Attorney\u2019s Lien against any and all real property owned at the time the case is filed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-9\">On May 26, 2015, Morgan Pierce filed a notice of an attorney\u2019s lien against five pieces of Lee\u2019s real property. The lien notice provided, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-10\">This lien is claimed for legal services rendered by Morgan Pierce, PLLP in 2014-15 pursuant to a Representation and Legal Services Agreement dated December 6, 2014 for legal services and costs advanced in Ms. Lee\u2019s Chapter 13 bankruptcy proceedings and related matters .... The reasonable value of the services is up to $25,000.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-11\">\u00b64 On May 28, 2015, Mulroy and Lee entered into an amended buy-sell agreement for two of the pieces of property against which Morgan Pierce\u2019s lien was recorded. As part of the buy-sell agreement, Mulroy agreed to pay debts owed by Lee to the Whitefish Credit Union and to Attorney William Hileman, Jr. The buy-sell agreement is silent regarding Lee\u2019s obligations to Morgan Pierce. On May 29,2015, Mulroy and Lee closed their transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-12\">\u00b65 On July 8, 2015, Mulroy filed a petition for interpleader and declaratory relief, asking the District Court to determine, among other issues, the validity of Morgan Pierce\u2019s attorney\u2019s lien. The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. The District Court granted Mulroy\u2019s motion for summary judgment and awarded his costs and fees. Morgan Pierce appeals the District Court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">\u00b66 We review de novo a district court\u2019s grant or denial of a motion for summary judgment. <em>Mont. Dep\u2019t of Revenue v. Priceline.com, Inc., </em>2015 MT 241, \u00b6 6, 380 Mont. 352, 354 P.3d 631. \u201cSummary judgment is appropriate when the moving party demonstrates an absence of a genuine issue of material fact and entitlement to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Priceline.com, Inc., </em>\u00b6 6 (citing M. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(3)). A district court\u2019s interpretation of a contract is a question of law, which we review for correctness. <em>Kluver v. PPL Mont., LLC, </em>2012 MT 321, \u00b6 19, 368 Mont. 101, 293 P.3d 817.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">\u00b67 <em>Whether the District Court erred in holding that the signed fee agreement between Morgan Pierce and Lee did not create a lien by consent.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b216-8\">\u00b68 The statute governing attorney\u2019s liens, \u00a7 37-61-420(1), MCA, provides: \u201cThe compensation of an attorney and counselor for services is governed by agreement, express or implied, which is not restrained by law.\u201d Thus, an attorney\u2019s lien is a contract for services. <em>See Sisters of Charity of Providence of Mont. v. Nichols, </em>157 Mont. 106, 111, 483 P.2d 279, 282 (1971). Section 28-2-102, MCA, sets forth the essential elements of a contract: \u201c(1) identifiable parties capable of contracting; (2) their consent; (3) a lawful object; and (4) a sufficient cause or consideration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AiL\">\u00b69  The District Court held that Lee did not consent to Morgan Pierce\u2019s attorney\u2019s lien because the lien did not sufficiently describe the subject property. In reaching this decision, the District Court indicated that it could find no cases directly on point and thus looked to other lien contexts for guidance, <em>citing Johnston v. Palmer, </em>2007 MT 99, 337 Mont. 101, 158 P.3d 998 (applying \u00a7 71-3-523, MCA, which governs construction liens and requires specific property descriptions); <em>Price Bldg. Serv., Inc. v. Holmes, </em>214 Mont. 456, 693 P.2d 553 (1985) (applying a statutory requirement that a contractor\u2019s lien must contain a description of the subject building); and <em>Johnson v. Erickson, </em>56 Mont. 550, 185 P. 1116 (1919) (applying a statute requiring a description of property subject to a mechanic\u2019s lien). As Morgan Pierce points out, all of the cases upon which the District Court relied are distinguishable from this case because they all involved the application of statutes that specifically required a property description. By contrast, the attorney\u2019s lien statute, \u00a7 37-61-420, MCA, contains no such requirement. \u201cIn the construction of a statute, the office of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>judge is simply to ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained therein, not to insert what has been omitted or to omit what has been inserted.\u201d Section 1-2-101, MCA. By holding that Lee did not consent to the attorney\u2019s lien because the lien did not include legal descriptions of her real property, the District Court inserted a requirement that does not exist in the statute, or in case law, governing attorney\u2019s liens. <em>See </em>\u00a7 37-61-420, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"A0m\">\u00b610  We reverse the District Court\u2019s decision and order granting summary judgment to Mulroy. Because we reverse the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to Mulroy, we also reverse its order granting costs and fees to Mulroy. We remand for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b217-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES McKINNON, BAKER and WHEAT concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
