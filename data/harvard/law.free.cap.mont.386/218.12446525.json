The District Court determined it lacked \u201cvenue jurisdiction\u201d and dismissed the petition. Appellants timely appealed. We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-9\">ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b243-10\">\u00b62 The issue on appeal is: Did the District Court err as a matter of law in dismissing the petition for lack of \u201cvenue jurisdiction\u201d?</p>\n<p id=\"b243-11\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b243-12\">\u00b63 C.J.L. was born in Havre, Montana, in 2015. Shortly after C.J.L.\u2019s birth, C.J.L.\u2019s mother signed an affidavit relinquishing her parental rights and consenting to C.J.L.\u2019s adoption by Appellants. She also signed a power of attorney granting Appellants the right to make parenting decisions in her stead. In November 2015, Appellants filed a consolidated petition to formally terminate the natural mother\u2019s parental rights, gain temporary legal custody of C.J.L. during the proceedings, and ultimately adopt C.J.L. At the time, C.J.L. lived with Appellants in Illinois and C.J.L.\u2019s natural mother lived in Havre. Although the petition was uncontested, the District Court ultimately dismissed the petition for lack of \u201cvenue jurisdiction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b243-13\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b243-14\">\u00b64 A district court\u2019s interpretation and application of a venue statute to pleaded facts is a conclusion of law that we review for correctness. <em>Yeager v. Morris, </em>2013 MT 44, \u00b6 9, 369 Mont. 90, 296 P.3d 1164. A district court\u2019s determination that it lacks jurisdiction over a matter is likewise a conclusion of law that we review for correctness. <em>In re Support Obligation of McGurran, </em>2002 MT 144, \u00b6 7, 310 Mont. 268, 49 P.3d 626.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-15\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b243-16\">\u00b65 <em>Did the District Court err as a matter of law in dismissing the petition for lack of \u201cvenue jurisdiction\u201d?</em></p>\n<p id=\"A79S\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>\u00b66  The distinction between jurisdiction and venue is well established. Simply put, jurisdiction refers to the authority of the court to adjudicate a case, whereas venue refers to the place where a case will be heard. <em>McGurran, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 12-13. No agreement of the parties can confer jurisdiction on a court that would otherwise lack authority to decide a case. <em>McGurran, </em>\u00b6 12. Venue, on the other hand, is a \u201cpersonal privilege of [a party] and, thus, may be waived.\u201d <em>McGurran, </em>\u00b6 13. We have long recognized that only the benefitted party may exercise this privilege\u2014a district court may not invoke a venue statute on the party\u2019s behalf. <em>Putro v. Mannix Elec., </em>147 Mont. 314, 319, 412 P.2d 410, 412 (1966) (citing <em>State ex rel. Gnose v. Dist. Court, </em>30 Mont. 188, 75 P. 1109 (1904)). If the benefitted party does not timely invoke this privilege, it will be deemed waived. <em>See </em>M. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">\u00b67 Montana\u2019s district courts have broad subject matter jurisdiction, encompassing \u201call civil matters and cases at law and in equity.\u201d Mont. Const, art. VII, \u00a7 4(1); <em>accord </em>\u00a7 3-5-302, MCA. Whether a particular district court is the proper place to hear a civil matter is generally determined by the venue statutes at \u00a7\u00a7 25-2-111 through -131, MCA. These statutes make clear that the \u201cdesignation of a county in this part as a proper place of trial is not jurisdictional and does not prohibit the trial of any cause in any court of this state having jurisdiction.\u201d Section 25-2-112, MCA. The Legislature has carved out several exceptions to the general venue guidelines of Title 25, chapter 2, part 1. In those instances, the proper place for trial will be determined by the more specific statute. Section 25-2-131, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">\u00b68 The general venue statutes consistently use the phrase \u201cproper place of trial\u201d rather than the more technical term \u201cvenue,\u201d but this language does not appear in the specific venue statute at issue here. In dismissing the petition, the District Court cited \u00a7 42-1-104(1), MCA, which states that \u201cI proceedings for adoption must be brought in the district court of the county where the petitioners reside.\u201d Although the statute is titled \u201cVenue,\u201d we have long held that \u201cthe text of the statute takes precedence over the title in matters of statutory interpretation.\u201d <em>Orozco v. Day, </em>281 Mont. 341, 347-48, 934 P.2d 1009, 1012-13 (1997). Because the plain language of the statute imposes a mandatory filing requirement, we understand why the District Court interpreted \u00a7 42-1-104, MCA, as more than a venue statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">\u00b69 This is not the first time we have addressed a venue statute that reads like a jurisdictional requirement. In <em>McGurran, </em>we considered whether \u00a7 2-4-702(2)(a), MCA, limited a district court\u2019s jurisdiction or simply designated proper venues. That statute establishes the process <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>for initiating judicial review of a contested administrative case. In relevant part, the statute provides that a petition for judicial review \u201cmust be filed in the district court for the county where the petitioner resides or has the petitioner\u2019s principal place of business or where the agency maintains its principal office.\u201d Section 2-4-702(2)(a), MCA. The district court in <em>McGurran </em>interpreted the statute \u201cas a requirement that a petition for judicial review must be filed in the correct venue for the court to obtain jurisdiction.\u201d <em>McGurran, </em>\u00b6 11 (internal quotation marks omitted). We disagreed, concluding that the above-quoted passage from \u00a7 2-4-702(2)(a), MCA, was nothing more than a venue provision, which could not deprive district courts of jurisdiction. <em>McGurran, </em>\u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">\u00b610 Sections 42-1-104(1), and 2-4-702(2)(a), MCA, contain similar mandatory language: \u201cmust be brought\u201d and \u201cmust be filed,\u201d respectively. Like the court in <em>McGurran, </em>the District Court here interpreted the mandatory terms as a jurisdictional requirement. As in <em>McGurran, </em>we hold that the statute at issue here is essentially a venue statute. Therefore, the mandatory language of \u00a7 42-1-104, MCA, does not deprive the District Court of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"Aye\">\u00b611  In the case of an uncontested adoption, there is no defendant or respondent to object on the grounds of improper venue. Although the present proceeding in Hill County is likely inconvenient for Appellants,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> they were not practically in a position to object to the proceeding on venue grounds. In fact, they affirmatively chose Hill County as the venue for the petition. The District Court may not invoke the venue statute <em>sua sponte. </em>We therefore conclude that the District Court erred as a matter of law in dismissing Appellants\u2019 petition for improper \u201cvenue jurisdiction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">\u00b612 The statutory framework of the Montana Adoption Act, Title 42, MCA, supports our conclusion. In cases of direct parental placement, the prospective adoptive parents must file both a petition to terminate existing parental rights and a petition to adopt the child who is the subject of the proceedings. Section 42-4-110(1), MCA. The statute implies both petitions should be filed in the same district court. <em>See </em>\u00a7 42-4-110(2), MCA (requiring petitioners to \u201crequest that <em>the court </em>promptly notice the matters\u201d for a timely hearing (emphasis added)). The venue statute governing petitions to terminate parental rights <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>provides that they \u201cmay be filed in the court in the county in which a petitioner resides, the child resides, or an office of the agency that is placing the child is located.\u201d Section 42-2-601, MCA. The residence of an unmarried minor is the residence of the minor\u2019s parents. Section 1-l-215(4)(a), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">\u00b613 C.J.L.\u2019s mother was a resident of Hill County when Appellants filed their petition. Although she had signed an affidavit waiving her parental rights, no court has formally terminated her rights and status as C.J.L.\u2019s parent. Applying \u00a7 l-l-215(4)(a), MCA, C.J.L. was still a resident of the same county as his mother when the petition was filed, even though he recently began living with Appellants in Illinois. Pursuant to \u00a7 42-2-601, MCA, Hill County is therefore a proper venue to hear the petition to terminate parental rights. Because \u00a7 42-4-110(2), MCA, contemplates that the same district court would hear both the petition to terminate parental rights and the petition to adopt, Hill County is logically the proper venue to hear Appellants\u2019 consolidated petition. To hold otherwise would force Appellants to initiate two distinct yet inseparably linked proceedings: one to terminate parental rights and one to adopt C.J.L. The former could be filed in Hill County, but the latter could not be filed in Montana. The slightest gap in coordinating the two proceedings could place C.J.L.\u2019s legal guardianship in limbo, which is decidedly not the intent of the Montana Adoption Act. <em>See </em>\u00a7 42-1-102, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"abi-dedup-0\">\u00b614  Despite its mandatory language, the adoption venue statute does not deprive the District Court of jurisdiction to consider Appellants\u2019 petition to adopt C.J.L. In light of the purpose and framework of the Montana Adoption Act, we conclude that Hill County is the proper venue to hear the consolidated petition to terminate the parental rights of C.J.L.\u2019s mother and adopt C.J.L. Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b246-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES WHEAT, SHEA and BAKER concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b245-8\"> Appellants informed the District Court that they filed their petition in Montana after several attorneys in their home state of Illinois advised them that Illinois did not have jurisdiction over the petition.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
