We affirm, restating the issues as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-10\">\n<em>1. Did the District Court err by denying the petition for postconviction relief?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-12\"><em>2. Did the District Court err by denying the requests for counsel and for an evidentiary </em>hearing?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-14\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b229-15\">\u00b62 Lacey pled guilty to four counts of felony Sexual Intercourse Without Consent and two counts of felony Sexual Assault. The facts related to these convictions are set forth in <em>State v. Lacey, </em>2009 MT 62, 349 Mont. 371, 204 P.3d 1192, wherein we affirmed Lacey\u2019s convictions, and we restate only those facts applicable to the issues raised here.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-16\">\u00b63 In February 2005, Lacey and his then-girlfriend, Carla Dozier <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>(Dozier), moved into a house together in Billings. The lease was exclusively in Dozier\u2019s name. Dozier had three children from previous relationships who also lived in the home with her and Lacey. The home contained a makeshift office, accessible by all members of the home, where Lacey routinely kept his laptop. While using Lacey\u2019s laptop, Dozier discovered sexually explicit images involving children, including pictures showing Lacey sexually abusing Dozier\u2019s six-year-old daughter. Dozier informed the Billings Police Department (BPD), who contacted the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)- Officers ultimately conducted searches of the house and garage, and seized the laptop, with Dozier\u2019s consent. A warrant was obtained to search the laptop.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">\u00b64 The search of the computer revealed numerous images of child pornography that Lacey had taken, including some images of Lacey engaging in sexually explicit conduct with Dozier\u2019s daughter. The computer also contained numerous images of child pornography Lacey had downloaded from the Internet. The evidence seized from the garage also revealed a videotape of Lacey sexually abusing a toddler girl he was babysitting. In sum, investigators found 217 movies and over 3,000 images of child pornography on the computer, including images of children clearly under the age of twelve and engaged in sadistic or masochistic abuse or other violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">\u00b65 The State of Montana filed an amended information charging Lacey with four counts of felony Sexual Intercourse Without Consent and five counts of felony Sexual Assault. Lacey was also charged in United States District Court for the District of Montana with three counts of Sexual Exploitation of Children, one count of Receipt of Child Pornography, one count of Possession of Child Pornography, and Forfeiture.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">\u00b66 Lacey pled guilty in the United States District Court to two counts of Sexual Exploitation of Children and one count of Possession of Child Pornography. He was sentenced to a total of 30 years in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">\u00b67 On his state charges, Lacey moved to suppress all evidence discovered in the course of the investigation. Two of those arguments are relevant to this appeal. First, Lacey argued that the seizure and search of his laptop violated his right to privacy under both Montana and Federal law, arguing Dozier did not have authority to consent to its seizure. Second, Lacey argued that the warrantless search of his garage was illegal because he never gave consent. Lacey argued that all evidence obtained flowed from illegal searches and seizures, so it should all be suppressed as \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b230-9\">\u00b68 After the District Court denied his motions to suppress, Lacey <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>entered a plea deal with the State of Montana, reserving his right to appeal the District Court\u2019s denials of his motions. Lacey pled guilty to four counts of felony Sexual Intercourse Without Consent and two counts of felony Sexual Assault. The State dismissed the remaining counts. Altogether, Lacey was sentenced to life in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">\u00b69 On appeal to this Court, Lacey argued that the District Court erred by not suppressing the physical evidence seized by the FBI and BPD. Specifically, he argued that Dozier \u201cdid not possess the requisite joint access, control, common authority, or possessory interest in the laptop in order to consent to its search and subsequent seizure,\u201d and that Dozier needed actual, not apparent, authority to consent. Lacey also argued that he \u201chad an actual and reasonable expectation of privacy in his computer files where the child pornography was found\u201d because they were placed in a \u201chidden\u201d file on his laptop and computers should be entitled to greater protection under the law of search and seizure. Regarding the garage search, Lacey argued that he had a reasonable and actual \u201cexpectation of privacy in his boxes and containers which were in the garage, and that Dozier did not have the required actual authority to consent to their search.\u201d Lacey argued that all the physical evidence should be excluded under the \u201cpoisonous tree\u201d doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">\u00b610 This Court rejected Lacey\u2019s suppression arguments. Regarding the laptop, we stated that Lacey correctly argued that Dozier \u201cdid not have the right or authority to consent to the seizure of [his] computer\u201d and, therefore, the officer who seized the laptop needed to have probable cause to do so. <em>Lacey, </em>\u00b6 49. We stated that \u201c[ajrguably, Dozier\u2019s statement to Officer Spaulding that she had observed images on the laptop showing Lacey sexually abusing her minor daughter was sufficient, by itself, to demonstrate probable cause to seize the laptop.\u201d <em>Lacey, </em>\u00b6 52. Examining the exceptions to the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine, we sua sponte determined that, even if probable cause to seize the laptop was lacking, the inevitable discovery exception applied and the search was proper. <em>Lacey, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 52-56. Regarding the search of the boxes in the garage, we held that \u201cDozier had sufficient common authority to consent to their search\u201d because Lacey let his items \u201cremain co-mingled, unmarked, and unlocked in a common area in a house he shared with Dozier which was rented in her name alone.\u201d <em>Lacey, </em>\u00b6 41.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">\u00b611 After we affirmed his convictions, Lacey initiated this proceeding, making four claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. First, Lacey contended that his trial counsel was ineffective because she failed to \u201cchallenge the \u2018exceptions\u2019 to <em>[Wong Sun v. United States, </em>371 U.S. 471, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>83 S. Ct. 407 (1963)] and the other legal requirements needed to search and seize under the 4th Amendment.\u201d Lacey argued that, although his trial counsel argued that all evidence should be suppressed under the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine, she should also have proactively argued against the three exceptions to the doctrine. Second, Lacey claimed his trial counsel failed \u201cto challenge the government!\u2019]s warrantless seizure of personal items retrieved from containers in the garage following a \u2018third party consent to search\u2019 said containers, in the absence of showing that probable cause clearly existed to seize personal items, without a warrant, once removed from containers and in plain view.\u201d Third, Lacey claimed his counsel erred by failing to seek a writ of supervisory control, after the denial of his suppression motions. Finally, Lacey argued his counsel erred by \u201cfailing to file a motion to dismiss State charges; based on MCA 46-11-504 (1) Double Jeopardy, after petitioner plead [sic] guilty and was sentenced to his federal charges which arose out of the same transaction.\u201d Lacey also moved for appointment of postconviction counsel and for the District Court to hold an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">\u00b612 The District Court held that all of Lacey\u2019s claims were barred either procedurally or for failure to state a claim, and denied Lacey\u2019s request for counsel and a hearing. Lacey challenges these rulings on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">\u00b613 We review a district court\u2019s denial of postconviction relief to determine if the court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous, and if its conclusions of law are correct. <em>Kenfield v. State, </em>2016 MT 197, \u00b6 7, 384 Mont. 322, 377 P.3d 1207. We review discretionary rulings in postconviction relief proceedings, including rulings related to whether to hold an evidentiary hearing, for an abuse of discretion. <em>Wilkes v. State, </em>2015 MT 243, \u00b6 9, 380 Mont. 388, 355 P.3d 755. We review de novo the mixed questions of law and fact presented by claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>Wilkes, </em>\u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b232-9\">\u00b614 <em>1. Did the District Court err by denying Lacey\u2019s postconviction relief petition?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b232-10\">\u00b615 Postconviction proceedings are governed by the statutory requirements in Title 46, chapter 21, MCA. \u201cWhen a petitioner has been afforded the opportunity for a direct appeal of the petitioner\u2019s conviction, grounds for relief that were or could reasonably have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>raised on direct appeal may not be raised, considered, or decided in a proceeding brought under this chapter.\u201d Section 46-21-105(2), MCA (2005).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A district court may dismiss a postconviction petition \u201cas a matter of law for failure to state a claim for relief.\u201d Section 46-21-201(l)(a), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">\u00b616 When considering whether a claim \u201ccould reasonably have been raised on direct appeal\u201d we determine if the claim is apparent based on the trial record. <em>State v. Herrman, </em>2003 MT 149, \u00b6 24, 316 Mont. 198, 70 P.3d 738 (\u201c[I]f the Court cannot make that determination from the record before it, then it must decline to proceed further and allow the defendant to raise his ineffective assistance of counsel claim in a petition for postconviction relief.\u201d); <em>State v. Lamere, </em>2005 MT 118, \u00b6 9, 327 Mont. 115, 112 P.3d 1005. \u201cWhen claims of ineffective assistance are capable of resolution by examining the record alone, they are appropriate for consideration on direct appeal.\u201d <em>State v. Howard, </em>2011 MT 246, \u00b6 21, 362 Mont. 196, 265 P.3d 606. We \u201cask \u2018why\u2019 counsel did or did not perform as alleged and then seek to answer the question by reference to the record.\u201d <em>Howard, </em>\u00b6 21 (citing <em>State v. Kougl, </em>2004 MT 243, \u00b6 14, 323 Mont. 6, 97 P.3d 1095). If we are unable to determine \u201cwhy\u201d counsel did or did not perform as alleged, those claims are addressed in a postconviction proceeding. <em>Kougl, </em>\u00b6 14; <em>Howard, </em>\u00b6 21. \u00b617 Postconviction petitions are also subject to res judicata. \u201cIf [the issues raised in the postconviction petition] were adequately raised [on direct appeal], the doctrine of res judicata bars relitigation of the issues.\u201d <em>Gollehon v. State, </em>1999 MT 210, \u00b6 51, 296 Mont. 6, 986 P.2d 395.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-6\">Res judicata bars relitigation, in a petition for postconviction relief, of issues already determined on direct appeal if: (1) the same ground presented in the subsequent application was determined adversely to the applicant in a prior action; (2) the prior determination was on the merits; and (3) the ends of justice would not be served by reaching the merits of the subsequent application.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-7\"><em>Smith v. State, </em>2000 MT 327, \u00b6 27, 303 Mont. 47, 15 P.3d 395; <em>accord State v. Baker, </em>272 Mont. 273, 282, 901 P.2d 54, 59 (1995). \u201c[E]nds of justice\u201d considerations, include, for example, where \u201ca criminal defendant is potentially subject to a facially illegal sentence,\u201d <em>State v. Southwick, </em>2007 MT 257, \u00b6 17, 339 Mont. 281, 169 P.3d 698, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>\u201cmanifest error\u201d is present in the prior proceeding, <em>Kills on Top v. State, </em>279 Mont. 384, 400, 928 P.2d 182, 192 (1996) (quoting <em>State v. Zimmerman, </em>175 Mont. 179, 185, 573 P.2d 174, 178 (1977)).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">\u00b618 As determined herein, Lacey\u2019s suppression claims are barred by the procedural and substantive requirements for postconviction petitions. However, his claims regarding a writ of supervisory control and double jeopardy are not. These two claims require an examination of his trial counsel\u2019s performance outside of the trial record and, as such, are appropriately raised in a postconviction proceeding. Each claim is addressed in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">Suppression Issues</p>\n<p id=\"AOoU\">\u00b619  Regarding the garage search, Lacey claims that his counsel was ineffective because she should have argued that the consent to search given by Dozier was ineffective without actual probable cause to search the containers. However, the consent issue was squarely addressed and resolved by this Court in Lacey\u2019s direct appeal. Examining Lacey\u2019s argument that Dozier did not have authority to consent, we held that \u201cLacey assumed the risk that Dozier could in fact assert control\u201d over his items because he allowed \u201chis items to remain co-mingled, unmarked, and unlocked in a common area in a house he shared with Dozier which was rented in her name alone.\u201d <em>Lacey, </em>\u00b6 41. Lacey\u2019s claim against his counsel is mooted because third-party consent is an exception to the warrant requirement and, therefore, no probable cause for a warrant was needed. <em>Lacey, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 37, 41. As such, this claim is barred by this Court\u2019s holding on direct appeal. Section 46-21-105(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">\u00b620 Regarding the laptop search, Lacey\u2019s argument is barred by res judicata. On direct appeal, Lacey argued that the evidence seized from his laptop should be suppressed because \u201ccomputers are entitled to greater protection under the law of search and seizure\u201d and that the evidence found thereon should be suppressed because \u201cthe \u2018fruit of the poisonous tree\u2019 doctrine applies.\u201d <em>Lacey, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 30, 32. In his postconviction petition, Lacey claimed that his counsel was ineffective because she failed \u201cto properly challenge the \u2018exceptions\u2019 to <em>[Wong Sun].\u201d </em>Lacey contends, in effect, that his counsel should have argued\u2014in addition to arguing the evidence should be excluded under <em>Wong </em>Sun\u2014that the exceptions to <em>Wong Sun </em>did not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-9\">\u00b621 In the direct appeal, we accepted Lacey\u2019s argument that \u201cDozier did not have the right or authority to consent to the seizure\u201d of the laptop. <em>Lacey, </em>\u00b6 49. However, we then examined whether Officer Spaulding had probable cause to seize the laptop and, lacking that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>whether one of the exceptions to the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine applied. Noting that we could apply the inevitable discovery exception sua sponte\u2014\u201cprovided there is a sufficient record\u201d\u2014we held \u201cit is clear, under the circumstances presented here that the evidence later discovered on the laptop pursuant to the federal search warrant is admissible under the \u2018inevitable discovery\u2019 exception to the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine.\u201d <em>Lacey, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 52, 55-56.</p>\n<p id=\"alu-dedup-0\">\u00b622  Thus, Lacey pursues an issue in his postconviction petition that has already been resolved. This Court made that determination on the merits, squarely applying case law regarding inevitable discovery, and holding there was \u201cno doubt that the evidence on the laptop would have been inevitably discovered even if Officer Spaulding had not initially seized the laptop after speaking with Dozier.\u201d <em>Lacey, </em>\u00b6 56. We do not find any \u201cmanifest injustice\u201d or other grounds where the \u201cends of justice\u201d prohibits application of res judicata. <em>Smith, </em>\u00b6 27. As such, Lacey\u2019s argument that his counsel was ineffective because she did not argue the exceptions to the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine is barred. Re-phrasing the issue as ineffective assistance of counsel does not change the fact that this Court reached and decided the issue on its merits. Lacey does not get a second bite at the apple.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">Writ of Supervisory Control and \u201cDouble Jeopardy\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">\u00b623 Lacey claims his trial counsel provided inadequate assistance by failing to seek a writ of supervisory control after his suppression motions were denied, and by not raising a double jeopardy issue after he pled guilty in Federal Court. Montana evaluates claims of ineffective assistance of counsel under the two-prong test articulated in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052 (1984). <em>Whitlow v. State, </em>2008 MT 140, \u00b6 10, 343 Mont. 90, 183 P.3d 861. Proving ineffective assistance requires:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-8\">First, the defendant must show that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient. This requires showing that counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the \u201ccounsel\u201d guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment. Second, the defendant must show that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense. This requires showing that counsel\u2019s errors were so serious as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial, a trial whose result is reliable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b235-9\"><em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687, 104 S. Ct. at 2064.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-10\">\u00b624 To demonstrate the representation was deficient, the defendant \u201cmust show that counsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness,\u201d i.e., it was \u201creasonable considering all the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>circumstances.\u201d <em>Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 14 (citing <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 688, 104 S. Ct. at 2064-65). Further, rather than seeking to scrutinize counsel\u2019s performance, \u201cevery effort must be made \u2018to eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight, to reconstruct the circumstances of counsel\u2019s challenged conduct, and to evaluate the conduct from counsel\u2019s perspective at the time.\u2019 \u201d <em>Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 15 (quoting <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 689, 104 S. Ct. at 2065). And, there is a \u201cstrong presumption\u201d that \u201ccounsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\u201d <em>Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 15 (citing <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 689, 104 S. Ct. at 2065).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">\u00b625 Lacey claims that his trial counsel should have sought a petition for writ of supervisory control with this Court following the District Court\u2019s denial of his suppression motions. In response to Lacey\u2019s postconviction petition, the District Court requested Lacey\u2019s trial attorney file an affidavit in response to Lacey\u2019s claims. Regarding a writ of supervisory control, Lacey\u2019s defense counsel averred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-6\">I have filed for such writs, and am familiar with not only the criteria set out in the relevant court rule, but also, the practice of the Montana Supreme Court as reflected in case law, and in my own law practice. Such writs are not granted as a matter of course, and in fact, are very rarely granted. A denial of a motion to suppress evidence in a criminal case would not be accepted by the Montana supreme [sic] Court on a writ of supervisory control because those issues are not of statewide interest, nor of such an unusual nature in the area of state constitutional law, such that the Court would consider granting such a writ.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Amz\">\u00b626  The Montana Rules of Appellate Procedure provide that the writ of supervisory control is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-8\">sometimes justified by circumstances of an emergency nature, as when a cause of action or a right has arisen under conditions making due consideration in the trial courts and due appeal to this court an inadequate remedy, or when supervision of a trial court other than by appeal is deemed necessary or proper.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b236-9\">M. R. App. P. 17(a) (2005). Lacey\u2019s case did not meet the required standard for a writ of supervisory control. There was no \u201cemergency,\u201d nor was the District Court acting under a mistake of law or gross injustice meaning a \u201cdue appeal\u201d was inadequate or supervision of the trial court was \u201cnecessary or proper.\u201d M. R. App. P. 17(a) (2005). The normal appeals process was an appropriate remedy following the District Court\u2019s rulings. Accordingly, trial counsel\u2019s decision to not seek a writ of supervisory control following the District Court\u2019s ruling on the suppression was not \u201cdeficient\u201d and did not fall below the standard of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>reasonableness.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">\u00b627 Then, citing to <em>State v. Neufeld, </em>2009 MT 235, 351 Mont. 389, 212 P.3d 1063, decided after Lacey\u2019s appeal was final, Lacey argues that his trial counsel provided ineffective assistance by not seeking dismissal of his state charges as \u201cdouble jeopardy\u201d under \u00a7 46-11-504, MCA, the multiple prosecution statute, after he pled guilty in Federal Court. Lacey argues that his case is nearly identical to <em>Neufeld </em>and, because the legal principles in <em>Neufeld </em>were in place when Lacey\u2019s case was brought (both trial and appeal), both his trial and appellate counsel were ineffective for failing to argue those principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">\u00b628 \u201c[A] court deciding an actual ineffectiveness claim must judge the reasonableness of counsel\u2019s challenged conduct on the facts of the particular case, <em>viewed as of the time of counsel\u2019s conduct.\u201d Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 690, 104 S. Ct. at 2066 (emphasis added). An attorney\u2019s performance is not assessed based upon subsequent changes in the law. <em>Hans v. State , </em>283 Mont. 379, 402, 942 P.2d 674, 688 (1997) (\u201cI S lubsequently decided case law cannot be used to judge an attorney\u2019s conduct at the time of representation.\u201d), <em>overruled in part on other grounds by Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 18, n. 4; <em>Foston v. State, </em>2010 MT 281, \u00b6 12, 358 Mont. 469, 245 P.3d 1103 (\u201cThe petitioner cannot rely on subsequently decided case law to render an attorney\u2019s conduct ineffective at the time of trial.\u201d). Lacey acknowledges these holdings by arguing <em>that Neufeld </em>was not some \u201cparadigmatic shift\u201d in this Court\u2019s jurisprudence, but rather was based upon legal principles \u201clong established in Montana law.\u201d However, we disagree with Lacey\u2019s position that they were \u201clong established\u201d at the time of his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">\u00b629 First, Lacey\u2019s appeal was decided by this Court on March 3, 2009 and <em>Neufeld </em>was decided on July 16, 2009. <em>Neufeld </em>had not yet been decided when Lacey pled guilty or his suppression issues were affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">\u00b630 Second, when both Lacey\u2019s trial and appellate counsel filed the briefs in his case, this Court\u2019s case law did not indicate this Court would find that Lacey was subject to double jeopardy. Montana\u2019s multiple prosecution statute provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-9\">When conduct constitutes an offense within the jurisdiction of any state or federal court, a prosecution in any jurisdiction is a bar to a subsequent prosecution in this state if: (1) the first prosecution resulted in an acquittal or in a conviction and the subsequent prosecution is based on an offense arising out of the same transaction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-10\">Section 46-11-504(1), MCA. Thus, whether a subsequent prosecution violates a defendant\u2019s rights under this statute is determined using a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>three part test:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-5\">(1) a defendant\u2019s conduct constitutes an offense within the jurisdiction of the court where the first prosecution occurred and within the jurisdiction of the court where the subsequent prosecution is pursued; (2) the first prosecution results in an acquittal or a conviction; and (3) the subsequent prosecution is based on an offense arising out of the same transaction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-6\"><em>State v. Tadewaldt, </em>277 Mont. 261, 264, 922 P.2d 463, 465 (1996); <em>State v. Gazda, </em>2003 MT 350, \u00b6 12, 318 Mont. 516, 82 P.3d 20. \u201cDue to the conjunctive nature of the statute, all three factors must be met in order to bar subsequent prosecution.\u201d <em>Gazda, </em>\u00b6 12. For the purposes of this appeal, examining the first factor is sufficient to determine that Lacey\u2019s counsel did not provide ineffective representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">\u00b631 At the time of Lacey\u2019s charges, and during Lacey\u2019s appeal, <em>Gazda </em>and <em>State v. Cech, </em>2007 MT 184, \u00b6 17, 338 Mont. 330, 167 P.3d 389, and the authority they relied on, defined concurrent jurisdiction for purposes of this double jeopardy argument. \u201cThis Court has explicitly held that jurisdiction exists in both courts when both jurisdictions have authority to prosecute for the same offense.\u201d <em>Gazda, </em>\u00b6 15; <em>accord State v. Sword, </em>229 Mont. 370, 373, 747 P.2d 206, 208 (1987) (\u201cThe measure of concurrent jurisdiction is whether defendant\u2019s conduct subjected him to prosecution in both jurisdictions.\u201d); <em>Zimmerman, </em>175 Mont. at 187, 573 P.2d at 179. \u201cI C loncurrent jurisdiction fails\u201d where \u201cstate and federal courts lack[] authority to prosecute <em>equivalent offenses based on the same underlying </em>conduct.\u201d <em>Gazda, </em>\u00b6 14 (citing <em>Sword, </em>229 Mont. at 373, 747 P.2d at 208) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">\u00b632 The offenses needed to be truly equivalent. In <em>Sword, </em>we affirmed the district court\u2019s dismissal where the State of Montana had charged the defendant with unlawfully taking a grizzly bear after he had already been charged for the same offense by Federal authorities. <em>Sword, </em>229 Mont. at 376, 747 P.2d at 210. This Court held the two jurisdictions had \u201cconcurrent jurisdiction\u201d by nature of the fact that both statutes used \u201cvirtually the same language.\u201d <em>Sword, </em>229 Mont. at 373-74, 747 P.2d at 208. The <em>Sword </em>Court relied on <em>Zimmerman, </em>which, similarly, held that the fact that both federal and state authorities had jurisdiction to bring embezzlement charges was a violation of Montana\u2019s multiple prosecution provisions. <em>Zimmerman, </em>175 Mont. at 187, 573 P.2d at 179. Conversely, the <em>Gazda </em>Court found no double jeopardy. Gazda was charged with deliberate homicide with a weapon in state court and by federal authorities with felon in possession of a weapon and ammunition. <em>Gazda, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 2-3. Gazda raised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>the multiple prosecution statute and we held that the first <em>Tadewaldt </em>factor was not implicated because \u201cItlhere is no suggestion that the United States could have charged Gazda with deliberate homicide, nor that the state could have charged Gazda with felon in possession, a federal statute with no comparable state statute.\u201d <em>Gazda, </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">\u00b633 <em>Cech, </em>decided months before Lacey filed his appeal, but after his trial counsel had brought her motion, reaffirmed <em>Gazda. </em>In <em>Cech, </em>the defendant stole a car in Montana and drove it to Washington State. <em>Cech, </em>\u00b6 4. Montana and Washington charged the defendant with different types of theft and he moved to dismiss his Montana charges claiming double jeopardy. <em>Cech, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 5-6. We agreed, holding that the underlying conduct gave both jurisdictions authority to prosecute for equivalent offenses of theft and, as such, met the first <em>Tadewaldt </em>factor. <em>Cech, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 17-18. \u201cCech was not charged with the identical offense in both states, but it was not necessary, for purposes of the first factor, that he was actually charged with identical or equivalent offenses, <em>only that his conduct at issue constituted an equivalent offense in both jurisdictions.\u201d Cech, </em>\u00b6 18 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">\u00b634 In sum, when trial and appellate counsel were representing Lacey, this Court had (1) not decided <em>Neufeld, </em>and (2) required both jurisdictions be able to prosecute \u201cequivalent offenses\u201d based on the defendant\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">\u00b635 When Lacey\u2019s trial and appellate counsel brought their motions, the charges Lacey faced from the Federal and Montana authorities were not considered \u201cequivalent offenses.\u201d In Federal Court, Lacey pled guilty to two counts of Sexual Exploitation of Children under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2251(a) (2000),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-8\">Any person who employs, uses, persuades, induces, entices, or coerces any minor to engage in, or who has a minor assist any other person to engage in, or who transports any minor in or affecting [interstate or foreign commerce], with the intent that such minor engage in, any sexually explicit conduct <em>for the purpose of producing any visual depiction of such conduct or for the purpose of transmitting a live visual depiction of such conduct, </em>shall be punished ... [if the person knows or has reason to know the visual depiction will be transported in interstate commerce].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"apl-dedup-0\">(Emphasis added.) In Montana, Lacey was charged with both Sexual Intercourse Without Consent and Sexual Assault. Section 45-5-503(1), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>MCA, provides that Sexual Intercourse Without Consent occurs when a person \u201cknowingly has sexual intercourse without consent with another person.\u201d \u201cSexual intercourse,\u201d as defined by \u00a7 45-2-101(68), MCA, requires actual \u201cpenetration of\u2019 either the vulva, anus, or mouth. Sexual Assault is when \u201c[a] person ... knowingly subjects another person to any sexual contact without consent.\u201d Section 45-5-502(1), MCA. \u201cSexual contact\u201d requires \u201ctouching of the sexual or other intimate parts of the person of another.\u201d Section 45-2-101(67), MCA. Contrasted with the F ederal offense of Sexual Exploitation of Children, the Montana statutes for Sexual Intercourse Without Consent and Sexual Assault differ in a significant respect: the Montana charges are physical in nature against another person, requiring \u201cpenetration of\u2019 or \u201ctouching\u201d respectively, while the Federal offense relates to the \u201cpurpose of producing any visual depiction\u201d or \u201ctransmitting a live physical depiction,\u201d and could be committed without actual physical contact.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">\u00b636 Title 18 of the United States Code contains similar offenses to Lacey\u2019s state charges, including Aggravated Sexual Abuse in Title 18, Section 2241, and Sexual Abuse in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2242. However, these offenses include the additional elements of the use of force or fear and, further, may only be charged in \u201cspecial maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States or in a Federal prison.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2241-42.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">\u00b637 Lacey\u2019s defense counsel, Ms. Strong, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-7\">[T]he Petitioner\u2019s federal convictions for sexual exploitation of children, did not concern the actual assaults and touching incidents, as I understood the underlying facts, but instead, related to his photographing and taking videos of his sexual interaction with the victims, and then, placing such illicit content on his laptop computer, which events occurred at dates and time different from the actual assaults on the victims.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">For this reason, Ms. Strong testified that she \u201cdecide[d] not to file [a double jeopardy motion to dismiss] because \u201c[s]uch would not qualify for a motion to dismiss under the same transactions and double jeopardy rule.\u201d This distinction reflected the jurisprudence in effect at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"aj9-dedup-0\">\u00b638  Under the state of the law when Lacey\u2019s trial and appellate counsel defended Lacey, neither provided ineffective assistance. Rather, given the \u201cstrong presumption,\u201d <em>Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 15 (citing <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 689, 104 S. Ct. at 2065), that counsel acted reasonably, and in light of the case law at the time, it was not unreasonable for counsel to not bring a double jeopardy claim. <em>Neufeld </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>was a significant departure from our prior jurisprudence. As outlined above, the statutes at issue here criminalized different conduct: the actual physical action against another person and the production and/or transmitting of a depiction of sexual conduct. <em>Neufeld </em>held that they were such \u201cequivalent\u201d offenses, but it was not unreasonable for counsel to think Montana law provided a different outcome before <em>Neufeld </em>was decided and, as such, would not meet the first <em>Tadewaldt </em>factor. Therefore, neither Lacey\u2019s trial or appellate counsel rendered ineffective assistance for failing to bring an argument he faced double jeopardy under \u00a7 46-11-504, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">\u00b639 <em>2. Did the District Court err by denying Lacey\u2019s requests for counsel and an evidentiary </em>hearing?</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">\u00b640 In postconviction proceedings, \u201c[i]f the death sentence has not been imposed and a hearing is required or if the interests of justice require, the court shall order [the appointment of counsel].\u201d Section 46-21-201(2), MCA. Pursuant to \u00a7 46-21-201(l)(a),MCA, the district court may dismiss a petition, without a hearing, based solely upon the case record. <em>Wilkes, </em>\u00b6 35. This Court reviews a district court\u2019s decision to hold an evidentiary hearing for abuse of discretion. <em>Wilkes, </em>\u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">\u00b641 As the above discussion demonstrates, the District Court correctly concluded that Lacey had \u201cfaile[ed] to state a claim for relief,\u201d \u00a7 46-21-201(l)(a), MCA, in his petition, and, as such, did not abuse its discretion in denying Lacey\u2019s motion to hold an evidentiary hearing. Further, Lacey was not facing the death penalty and, we conclude that, based on these circumstances, there are no considerations requiring Lacey be appointed counsel in the interests of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">\u00b642 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b241-9\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES WHEAT, SHEA and BAKER concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b233-8\"> All Montana Code Annotated references hereinafter are from the 2005 edition unless otherwise indicated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b239-9\"> All United States Code references hereinafter are from the 2000 edition unless otherwise indicated.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
