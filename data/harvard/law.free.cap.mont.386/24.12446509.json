Larry Hunter (Larry) in 2011. In its effort to satisfy the judgment, 623 Partners claimed that property originally owned by Hunter Development was fraudulently transferred to Larry\u2019s son, Larry Todd Hunter (Todd), in order to avoid subjecting the property to 623 Partners\u2019 writ of attachment. The Nineteenth Judicial District Court concluded that the property was fraudulently transferred and that Todd was liable to 623 Partners for the proceeds he received from the sale of a parcel of the property. We upheld those determinations in <em>623 Partners, LLC v. Hunter, </em>2014 MT 282N, 377 Mont. 433, 348 P.3d 169 (Table) (hereafter <em>Hunter I).</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>On remand, Todd argued that the property was exempt from execution or forced sale because he had claimed it as his homestead, and that he was entitled to an offset from the judgment amount based on the value of the improvements that he made to the property. The District Court rejected Todd\u2019s assertions.</p>\n<p id=\"A3IB\">\u00b62 We conclude that Todd is not entitled to a homestead exemption or an offset. We therefore affirm the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"A3Df\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"A94D\">\u00b63 Larry and Glenda Hunter owned and operated Hunter Development, which developed residential subdivisions in Georgia and Montana. Todd moved to Fortine, Montana, in 2002 and ran a contracting business. Shortly after Todd moved to Montana, Hunter Development purchased a number of parcels of land near Fortine. Todd built a home and made other improvements on a parcel of the Fortine property beginning in 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"AeI\">\u00b64 Hunter Development executed and delivered a promissory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>note\u2014the loan obligation underlying this action\u2014to Georgia State Bank in May 2007. Hunter Development secured the promissory note with real property it owned in Georgia and with Larry\u2019s personal guaranty. The promissory note and guaranty were subsequently transferred and assigned to 623 Partners.</p>\n<p id=\"a_l-dedup-0\">\u00b65 Shortly after executing the promissory note, Larry and Glenda formed the R. Larry Hunter and Glenda Hunter Montana Revocable Trust (Trust). In June 2007, Larry and Glenda conveyed three parcels of the Fortine property to the Trust through a quitclaim deed for no consideration. The parcels were to be held by the Trust and distributed to the Hunters\u2019 children when Larry and Glenda died.</p>\n<p id=\"A78z\">\u00b66 Hunter Development and Larry defaulted on their payment obligations under the promissory note in May 2008. Later that month, the Trust and Todd entered into a purchase agreement for the parcels of the Fortine property held by the Trust. The Trust conveyed the parcels to Todd by warranty deed. Todd made only one payment to the Trust under the purchase agreement. Todd later sold one of the parcels but did not pay the Trust the full amount of the proceeds from the sale. In February 2011, Todd claimed as his homestead the parcel with his home and improvements, as provided in Title 70, Chapter 32, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"AaAP\">\u00b67 623 Partners filed suit against Hunter Development and Larry in Georgia prior to Todd\u2019s homestead declaration. It obtained a judgment against them in the amount of $1.2 million. In April 2011,623 Partners filed this claim in the Nineteenth Judicial District Court seeking to set aside alleged fraudulent transfers of the Fortine property. 623 Partners also recorded a <em>lis pendens </em>on the remaining parcels.</p>\n<p id=\"A6u\">\u00b68 The District Court granted 623 Partners partial summary judgment. The court held: (1) that the Trust\u2019s conveyance of the Fortine property to Todd was a fraudulent transfer pursuant to \u00a7 31-2-334(2), MCA, and was \u201caccordingly void, set aside, and annulled\u201d; (2) that Larry and Glenda\u2019s conveyance of the Fortine property to the Trust was not a qualifying transfer under \u00a7 31-2-328(12), MCA, was made in violation of \u00a7 31-32-334(2), MCA, and was \u201caccordingly void, set aside, and annulled\u201d; (3) that the Fortine property was subject to 623 Partners\u2019 writ of attachment for purposes of satisfying its judgment against Hunter Development and Larry; and (4) that Todd was liable to 623 Partners for the proceeds he received from the sale of the parcel of the Fortine property. The court ordered that the Fortine property could not be transferred or encumbered and that the property was to be sold in order to satisfy 623 Partners\u2019 judgment against Hunter Development and Larry.</p>\n<p id=\"AF1\">\u00b69 Todd filed a motion requesting relief from the District Court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>judgment and for a stay of the sale of the property. Todd argued, in part, that he was entitled to an offset from the judgment amount based on the value of the improvements that he made to the property and that the property was exempt from execution or forced sale because he had claimed it as his homestead. The District Court stayed the execution and sale of the Fortine property, but declined to decide Todd\u2019s offset and homestead exemption claims before 623 Partners attempted execution. Todd then appealed the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to 623 Partners. We affirmed the District Court\u2019s order and remanded for further proceedings on Todd\u2019s homestead exemption claim. <em>Hunter I, </em>\u00b6 31.</p>\n<p id=\"AHK9\">\u00b610 On remand, 623 Partners moved for summary judgment on Todd\u2019s homestead exemption claim. Todd moved for an order granting his homestead exemption and offset claims. The court granted 623 Partners summary judgment regarding the homestead exemption but concluded that it lacked jurisdiction over the offset issue due to an order in a related proceeding in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Montana. The Bankruptcy Court then issued an order authorizing the District Court to address the offset issue. Todd renewed his motion for an offset, which the District Court denied. Todd appeals the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to 623 Partners regarding his homestead exemption claim and the District Court\u2019s denial of his motion for an offset.</p>\n<p id=\"AMW\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"A7o\">\u00b611 We review summary judgment rulings de novo, applying the standards set forth in M. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(3). <em>Citizens for a Better Flathead v. Bd. of Cnty. Comm\u2019rs, </em>2016 MT 256, \u00b6 10, 385 Mont. 156, 381 P.3d 555. We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether they are correct. <em>Citizens for a Better Flathead, </em>\u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"Ag8i\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"A5is\">\u00b612 <em>1. Whether the District Court correctly concluded that Todd did not qualify for a homestead exemption.</em></p>\n<p id=\"A_s\">\u00b613 Relying in part on <em>McCone County Federal Credit Union v. Gribble, </em>2009 MT 290, 352 Mont. 254, 216 P.3d 206, the District Court concluded that Todd did not qualify for a homestead exemption because he never owned the property. The court reiterated that Todd obtained the property through a preferential transfer pursuant to \u00a7 31-2-334(2), MCA, and thus that the transfer qualified as a fraudulent transfer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>under Montana\u2019s Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act (UFTA), \u00a7\u00a7 31-2-326 to -342, MCA. Because Todd obtained the property through a fraudulent transfer, the court reiterated that the transfer had been set aside and that the property had revested in the Trust. The court noted that we upheld these determinations in <em>Hunter I. </em>The court clarified that, based upon its earlier rulings, \u201cTodd was never the rightful owner of the property.\u201d Relying on authority from other states pertaining to homesteads, the court concluded that Todd could not claim a homestead exemption because he never owned the property.</p>\n<p id=\"AEg\">\u00b614 In <em>Hunter I, </em>we affirmed the District Court\u2019s conclusion that the Trust\u2019s conveyance of the property to Todd qualified as a fraudulent transfer under the UFTA. <em>Hunter I, </em>\u00b6 23. We affirmed further the District Court\u2019s conclusion that the property revested in the Trust and was subject to execution by 623 Partners. <em>Hunter I, </em>\u00b6 24; <em>accord Gribble, </em>\u00b6 17 (concluding that when a transfer is set aside as fraudulent under the UFTA, \u201cthe property at issue revests in the debtor who transferred it,\u201d and \u201cthe creditor may make a claim against it for purposes of satisfying a judgment the creditor has against the debtor\u201d). Our decision affirming the District Court\u2019s judgment established the law of the case that, as the District Court held, the transfer was \u201caccordingly void, set aside, and annulled.\u201d <em>See Fiscus v. Beartooth Elec. Coop., </em>180 Mont. 434, 437, 591 P.2d 196, 197 (1979) (concluding that when we state in an opinion \u201ca principle or rule of law necessary to the decision, such pronouncement becomes the law of the case, and must be adhered to throughout its subsequent progress\u201d) (citation and internal quotations omitted). The District Court therefore correctly clarified upon remand that Todd never lawfully owned the property. <em>See </em>\u00a7 31-2-339(1)(a), MCA (providing that under the UFTA, a creditor may obtain \u201cavoidance of the transfer ... to the extent necessary to satisfy the creditor\u2019s claim\u201d); 37 Am. Jur. 2d Fraudulent Conveyances and Transfers \u00a7 116 (2015) (providing that a fraudulent transfer \u201cis void or voidable and will be set aside in a proper proceeding\u201d). The purpose of remand was to allow the District Court to determine whether Todd could avail himself of any exemptions from execution.</p>\n<p id=\"aih-dedup-0\">\u00b615 Homesteads generally are \u201cexempt from execution or forced sale.\u201d Section 70-32-201, MCA. The homestead exemption applies to the UFTA. <em>Gribble, </em>\u00b6 24 (concluding that \u201ca homestead is not an \u2018asset\u2019 under the UFTA and therefore is not subject to the provisions of the Act\u201d). Thus, if Todd properly could claim the property as a homestead, the property would not be subject to execution by 623 Partners.</p>\n<p id=\"A3K\">\u00b616 We have not directly considered whether a person may claim a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>homestead on property that he or she has never lawfully owned. We have, however, addressed whether a person could protect the proceeds from the sale of a home she owned when she filed a homestead declaration after selling the home. <em>In re Snyder, </em>2006 MT 308, 335 Mont. 11, 149 P.3d 26. Snyder had sold her home in February, filedher homestead exemption in September, and filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in October. <em>Snyder, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 2-3. In concluding that she had the right to exempt a portion of the proceeds from the sale of her home from the bankruptcy estate, we noted that the UFTA \u201cprovides protection for traceable proceeds from [properties that have been sold or taken by condemnation] if the properties <em>\u2018could have been claimed </em>as an exempt homestead\u2019 ... at the time of disposal.\u201d <em>Snyder, </em>\u00b6 10 (quoting \u00a7 70-32-216, MCA) (emphasis in original). <em>Snyder </em>thus establishes that a claimant does not have to own the property when she files a homestead exemption so long as the property could have been claimed as a homestead in the first place.</p>\n<p id=\"AJAe\">\u00b617 In construing a statute, we look \u201cto the plain meaning\u201d of its language, and we read the \u201cstatute as a part of a whole statutory scheme.\u201d <em>Eldorado Coop Canal Co. v. Hoge, </em>2016 MT 145, \u00b6 18, 383 Mont. 523, 373 P.3d 836 (citations and internal quotations omitted). Chapter 32 of Title 70, MCA, sets forth a number of requirements for establishing a homestead. Sections 70-32-101 to -107, MCA. Significantly, \u00a7 70-32-103, MCA, entitled, \u201cFrom whose property homestead maybe selected,\u201d provides that a married couple may select a homestead \u201cfrom the <em>property of either spouse,\u201d </em>and an unmarried person may select a homestead \u201cfrom any of the <em>claimant\u2019s property.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) The statute\u2019s plain language establishes that a person may select a homestead from <em>his or her property </em>only. Reading the Homestead Act as a whole supports this conclusion. <em>E.g., </em>\u00a7 70-32-104(2), MCA (\u201cIf a claimant who is <em>an owner </em>of an undivided interest in real property claims a homestead exemption ....\u201d) (emphasis added); \u00a7 70-32-216(1), MCA (\u201cIf property ... that could have been claimed as an exempt homestead has been sold ... and <em>the owner </em>has been indemnified for the property, <em>the owner </em>is entitled for 18 months to exemption of the proceeds that are traceable.\u201d) (emphasis added). Restricting a person to claiming a homestead on property the person owns\u2014or has owned\u2014furthers one of the homestead exemption\u2019s primary purposes: \u201cto promote the stability and welfare of the state by encouraging property ownership.\u201d 40 Am. Jur. 2d Homestead \u00a7 4 (2015).</p>\n<p id=\"AXe\">\u00b618  While the homestead exemption may protect property from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>execution or forced sale under the UFTA, <em>Gribble, </em>\u00b6 24, the property has to qualify as a homestead in the first place, <em>Snyder, </em>\u00b6 10. Todd\u2019s title to the Fortine property derived from a fraudulent transaction. Because that transaction was declared void, Todd never owned the property. Todd could not claim the property as a homestead. The District Court correctly applied the law on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"AOUY\">\u00b619 <em>2. Whether the District Court correctly concluded that Todd was not entitled to an offset for improvements he made to the property.</em></p>\n<p id=\"A9QC\">\u00b620 The District Court determined that even though Todd\u2019s claim for an offset suffered from a number of procedural flaws, it also lacked substantive support in the law. The court noted that \u00a7 31-2-340(6)(a), MCA\u2014upon which Todd initially based his offset claim\u2014was not applicable to the circumstances of this case, in part because the improvements Todd made to the property were completed before the Trust transferred the property to him. Thus, the court concluded, \u201cThe improvements made prior to the transfer were merged with the real property when it was conveyed and cannot be separated.\u201d The court determined that the statute was further inapplicable because \u201c[a]ny \u2018new value\u2019 given by the improvements were for Todd Hunter\u2019s (found to be an \u2018insider\u2019) benefit, not \u2018to or for the benefit of the debtor,\u2019 as required by \u00a7 31-2-340(6)(a), MCA.\u201d The court concluded that Todd could not rely on \u00a7 31-2-340(6)(a), MCA, because it \u201cis designed to protect an insider who is also an unsecured creditor of the debtor\u201d and Todd was not a creditor of Larry. Finally, the court concluded, the general offset doctrine \u201capplies only to parties who are mutually indebted.\u201d The court noted that Todd did not, and could not, claim that 623 Partners was indebted to him. The District Court thus concluded that Todd could not claim an offset.</p>\n<p id=\"AWEq\">\u00b621 On appeal, Todd argues that the District Court incorrectly determined that he was not entitled to recover the value of his labor and improvements he made to the property. Todd contends that public policy and equitable considerations support his position. He asserts that \u201cthe UFTA does not provide any statutory or legal protection for a transferee who loses his property when there is a narrow finding of a preferential transfer under \u00a7 31-2-334(2), MCA.\u201d Without developing his argument, Todd contends that principles of law and equity supplement the UFTA\u2019s provisions pursuant to \u00a7 31-2-342, MCA. Todd asserts further that \u201cit is well established that a district court may accept jurisdiction in equity when no statutory or legal remedy is available.\u201d Accordingly, Todd contends, we should invoke our equitable authority and conclude that he \u201cis entitled to receive an offset or credit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>for the value of his labor and improvements he made to the property.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AKcO\">\u00b622 Section 31-2-340(6), MCA, affords transferees who receive assets through a preferential transfer pursuant to \u00a7 31-2-334(2), MCA, three possible defenses to forestall avoidance of the transfer. Yet, as the District Court concluded\u2014and Todd apparently concedes on appeal\u2014the statute is inapplicable to the circumstances of this case. While Todd does not contest the District Court\u2019s determination regarding the statute\u2019s applicability, he does contend that he is entitled to an equitable interest or credit for the value of his labor on and improvements to the property based on principles of law and equity.</p>\n<p id=\"Az9b\">\u00b623 As Todd points out, the provisions of the UFTA may be supplemented by other principles of law and equity. Section 31-2-342, MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Anz\">Unless displaced by the provisions of this part, the principles of law and equity, including the law merchant and the law relating to principal and agent, estoppel, laches, fraud, misrepresentation, duress, coercion, mistake, insolvency, or other validating or invalidating cause, supplement its provisions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AasN\">The statute makes clear that unless the UFTA provides otherwise, other remedies may be available outside the UFTA. <em>See Gulf Ins. Co. v. Clark, </em>2001 MT 45, \u00b6 42, 304 Mont. 264, 20 P.3d 780 (relying on \u00a7 31-2-342, MCA, to observe that \u201canother remedy at equity or law [outside the UFTA] may be available\u201d to a creditor). Based on provisions nearly identical to \u00a7 31-2-342, MCA, other courts have recognized that principles such as estoppel, laches, and waiver may be invoked as a defense in fraudulent transfer actions. <em>E.g., Sheffield Steel Corp. v. HMK Enters., </em>320 B.R. 423, 452-54 (Bankr. N.D. Okla. 2004); <em>Reitmeyer v. Meinen, </em>232 B.R. 827, 843-44 (Bankr. W.D. Pa. 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"Ayma\">\u00b624 But beyond his general assertion of fairness, Todd has not articulated what, if any, principles of law and equity apply. Such principles require the party relying on them not only to assert them, but to make certain showings. <em>See, e.g., McKay v. Wilderness Dev., LLC, </em>2009 MT 410, \u00b6 29, 353 Mont. 471, 221 P.3d 1184 (defense of waiver must be affirmatively pled); <em>Cole v. State ex rel. Brown, </em>2002 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>MT 32, \u00b6 25, 308 Mont. 265, 42 P.3d 760 (concluding that \u201cin order to apply the doctrine of laches, a showing must be made that the passage of time has prejudiced the party asserting laches or has rendered the enforcement of a right inequitable\u201d); <em>City of Whitefish v. Troy Town Pump, </em>2001 MT 58, \u00b6 20, 304 Mont. 346, 21 P.3d 1026 (concluding that the \u201csix elements of equitable estoppel must be established, and by clear and convincing evidence\u201d). It is not our responsibility \u201cto conduct legal research on behalf of a party or to develop legal analysis that might support a party\u2019s position.\u201d <em>State v. </em>Gunderson, 2010 MT 166, \u00b6 12, 357 Mont. 142, 237 P.3d 74. Consequently, we decline to determine whether any established principles of law and equity could entitle Todd to recover the value of his labor and improvements made to the property. We accordingly conclude that the District Court properly determined that Todd was not entitled to an offset.</p>\n<p id=\"A0__\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"AKW2\">\u00b625 We affirm the District Court\u2019s orders and judgment.</p>\n<judges id=\"AgQY\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES McKINNON, SHEA and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"AeC\"> Montana Supreme Court Internal Operating Rules, Section I, Paragraph 3(d)(v) provides in pertinent part that noncitable opinions \u201cshall not be cited or relied upon as authority in any litigation in any court in Montana except when the decision establishes the law of the case.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"AVWe\"> 623 Partners contends that the District Court lacked jurisdiction to address Todd\u2019s offset claim because Todd did not preserve the claim in the first appeal.
