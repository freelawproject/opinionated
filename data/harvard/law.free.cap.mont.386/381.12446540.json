We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-9\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b406-10\">\u00b62 We reframe the issues on appeal as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-11\"><em>1. Did the Youth Court err by revoking the youth\u2019s previously imposed youth court commitment and committing him to the Department of Corrections for placement at a state youth correctional facility </em>?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-12\"><em>2. Did counsel for K.J.R. provide ineffective assistance by failing to object to revocation proceedings in the absence of previously imposed probationary conditions </em>?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-13\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b406-14\">\u00b63 By petition filed June 20,2012, the State charged twelve-year-old K. J.R. with seven felony and misdemeanor offenses including theft of a motor vehicle, theft of a .40 caliber handgun, criminal mischief in the shooting of a calf, criminal trespass, and accountability to theft of a motor scooter in Toole County, Montana. Upon K. J.R.\u2019s admission that he committed \u201can act which, if committed by an adult, would constitute a criminal act,\u201d the Ninth Judicial District Youth Court adjudicated K.J.R. tobe a \u201cdelinquent youth,\u201d as defined by \u00a7 41-5-103(11)(a),MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"Axx0\">\u00b64 At the time of the original dispositional hearing on July 12, 2012, K.J.R.\u2019s parents were both incarcerated on drug-related offenses and unavailable to parent him. The Youth Court committed K. J.R. \u201cto the supervision\u201d of the Youth Court until age eighteen, or sooner released, for placement at a specific therapeutic group home in Billings. The dispositional order further provided that the \u201cYouth Court Officer shall have the ability to find an alternative suitable placement\u201d if the specified placement was \u201cnot attainable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b406-15\">\u00b65 For reasons not of record on appeal, the supervising juvenile probation officer initially placed the youth at a non-therapeutic group home in Great Falls. Over the next three years, the juvenile probation officer moved K.J.R. in and out of a sequence of juvenile facilities and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>foster care homes. Between placements, K. J.R. spent considerable time in juvenile detention until his probation officer could secure the next placement.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">\u00b66 KJ.R.\u2019s first placement at the Missouri River Group Home in Great Falls lasted only a few months before the facility requested his removal for disruptive behavior and violations of house rules. The probation officer next placed K.J.R. at the Youth Christian Ranch in Roundup, which lasted two years before the facility requested his removal due to disorderly conduct, truancy, and marijuana use. The next placement at the North Skyline Youth Home in Great Falls ended within a few weeks after K.J.R. fought with other boys and violated house rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">\u00b67 Violations of house rules similarly triggered K. J.R.\u2019s removal from his fourth placement at a therapeutic foster care home in Shelby. His juvenile probation officer then arranged for a kinship placement with an aunt in Shelby in anticipation of the return of K. J.R.\u2019s mother upon her completion of a prerelease program in Great Falls.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">\u00b68 On September 8,2015, based on new allegations that fifteen-year-old K.J.R. had recently been truant, insubordinate at school, involved in an assault, and failed to timely return to Shelby from Great Falls, the State filed a petition to revoke K.J.R.\u2019s Youth Court probation. At the adjudicatory hearing on September 30, 2015, the Youth Court adjudicated the alleged probation violations as true.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">\u00b69 The Youth Court continued the dispositional hearing four times to allow K.J.R.\u2019s counsel time to find an alternative therapeutic placement. At the hearing on October 29, 2015, counsel reported that his efforts to secure placement for K.J.R. failed because K.J.R. lacked an up-to-date psychiatric evaluation. A contemplated out-of-state therapeutic placement required Medicaid funding, which was not available without a current psychiatric evaluation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ALr6\">\u00b610 At the close of the dispositional hearing, the Youth Court revoked K.J.R.\u2019s original commitment to the Youth Court for private, out-of-home placement. Pursuant to the recommendations of the juvenile probation officer and the youth placement committee, the Court committed K.J.R. to the supervision of the Montana Department of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>Corrections (DOC) for placement at the Pine Hills Youth Correctional Facility until age eighteen or sooner released. The Court also ordered K.J.R. to complete a chemical dependency program at Pine Hills.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">\u00b611 We review a youth court\u2019s application and interpretation of the Youth Court Act de novo for correctness. <em>In re K.J., </em>2010 MT 41, \u00b6 13, 355 Mont. 257, 231 P.3d 75 <em>(citing In re G.T.M., </em>2009 MT 443, \u00b6 9, 354 Mont. 197, 222 P.3d 626). Whether a person has been denied the right to due process is a question of constitutional law and our review is plenary. <em>In re A.S., </em>2004 MT 62, \u00b6 9, 320 Mont. 268, 87 P.3d 408.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">\u00b612 The standard of review of a youth court\u2019s modification of a prior order under \u00a7 41-5-1422, MCA, is for an abuse of discretion. <em>In re C.D.H., </em>2009 MT 8, \u00b6 21, 349 Mont. 1, 201 P.3d 126 (citing <em>Matter of B.L.T., </em>258 Mont. 468, 470, 853 P.2d 1226, 1227 (1993)). The test for an abuse of discretion is \u201cwhether the trial court acted arbitrarily, without employment of conscientious judgment, or exceeded the bounds of reason resulting in substantial injustice.\u201d <em>C.D.H., </em>\u00b6 21 (citing <em>A.S., </em>\u00b6 24).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b408-9\">\u00b613 <em>1. Did the Youth Court err by revoking the youth\u2019s previously imposed youth court commitment and committing him to the Department of Corrections for placement at a state youth correctional </em>facility?</p>\n<p id=\"b408-10\">\u00b614 K.J.R. contends the Youth Court unlawfully revoked his probation and prior Youth Court disposition because his original Youth Court commitment was not subject to any specific court-imposed probationary conditions. Because the court could not legally determine the youth to have violated nonexistent terms of probation, K.J.R. asserts the court\u2019s probation revocation and resulting DOC commitment order were unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-11\">\u00b615 For its part, the State argues on appeal that K.J.R. waived the issue of the validity of the subject orders by failing to timely object below. Inattentive to the original disposition in this matter, the State further attempts to rebrand various detention release conditions imposed by the Youth Court in July and August 2015 as subsequently-imposed conditions of K.J.R.\u2019s underlying probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-12\">\u00b616 This Court generally will not review an issue not raised below. <em>In re KM.G., </em>2010 MT 81, \u00b6 19, 356 Mont. 91, 229 P.3d 1227 (citing <em>State v. Kotwicki, </em>2007 MT 17, \u00b6 8, 335 Mont. 344, 151 P.3d 892). The objecting party must first give the trial court the opportunity to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>address and correct any perceived errors. <em>K.M.G., </em>\u00b6 36. As an exception to the general rule, we will review a final disposition alleged to be illegal or in excess of statutory mandates even if the defendant failed to raise the issue in the trial court. <em>K.M.G., </em>\u00b6 19 (citing <em>Kotwicki, </em>\u00b6 8; <em>State v. Lenihan, </em>184 Mont. 338, 343, 602 P.2d 997, 1000 (1979)).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">\u00b617 Because K.J.R. claims the Youth Court unlawfully revoked his prior disposition and, thus, lacked the subsequent authority to commit him to DOC for placement at Pine Hills, the gravamen of his appeal is a challenge to the legality of his second Youth Court disposition. We conclude the claim qualifies for review on appeal despite the lack of a lower court objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">\u00b618 Upon adjudication of a \u201cdelinquent youth,\u201d the Youth Court Act authorizes various final dispositions in the discretion of the court including, <em>inter </em>alia:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-7\">(1) placing \u201cthe youth on probation\u201d under the continuing jurisdiction of the youth court pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 41-5-1513(1)(a) and -1512(1)(a), MCA;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-8\">(2) committing \u201cthe youth to the youth court\u201d for placement in a private, out-of-home facility pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 41-5-1513(1)(a) and - 1512(1)(c), MCA; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-9\">(3) committing \u201cthe youth to the department\u201d for placement in a state youth correctional facility until age 18 or sooner released pursuant to \u00a7 41-5-1513(1)(b), MCA.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-10\">The youth court may impose any authorized disposition following a formal hearing and consideration of a predisposition report or assessment filed and served by a juvenile probation officer. Section 41-5-1511(2) through (4), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-11\">\u00b619 Because the Youth Court Act does not define \u201cprobation,\u201d we turn to other parts of the Montana Code to determine the meaning of the term. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1-2-107, MCA (a word or phrase defined by one part of the code is applicable to the same word or phrase in other parts of the code except where a contrary intention plainly appears). In the context of a juvenile sex crime, the law defines probation as the \u201csupervision of the juvenile by a youth court pursuant to Title 41, chapter 5.\u201d Section 45-5-501(3)(b)(ii), MCA. The Interstate Compact on Juveniles defines the term as \u201cany kind of supervision or conditional release of juveniles authorized under the laws of the compacting states.\u201d Section 41-6-101, MCA. Title 46 similarly defines the term as \u201crelease by the court without imprisonment of a defendant found guilty of a crime ... subject to supervision by the department of corrections upon direction of the court.\u201d Section 46-1-202(21), <em>MCA;accord </em>\u00a7 46-23-1001(4), MCA. Thus, for purposes of the Act, probation generally means the court-ordered release of a youth, subject to supervision under court-ordered terms <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>and conditions. The youth court has the exclusive authority to impose or modify the terms and conditions of probation. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 41-5-103(18), -1422, -1511, -1512(l)(a), (i), -1513(l)(a), MCA (adjudication and disposition of delinquent youth and court authority to modify youth court orders); <em>compare </em>\u00a7 41-5-1703(l)(c), (2), MCA (juvenile probation officer duty to supervise youth court probationers and enforce probation conditions).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">\u00b620 Upon formal petition and hearing, the court may revoke a youth\u2019s previously imposed probation upon a finding that the youth \u201cviolated a term of probation.\u201d Section 41-5-1431(1), (2), MCA. The petition \u201cmust state the terms of probation alleged to have been violated and the factual basis\u201d for the alleged violations. Section 41-5-1431(2), MCA. Upon adjudication of the violation of \u201ca term of probation, the youth court may make any judgment of disposition that could have been made in the original case.\u201d Section 41-5-1431(3), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">\u00b621 In contrast, without reference to probation or probation conditions, a commitment to the youth court for private, out-of-home placement references only certain conditions of <em>placement.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>By its express and limited references to \u201cprobation\u201d and \u201cterm of probation,\u201d the probation revocation procedure specified by \u00a7 41-5-1431, MCA, does not apply to a revision or revocation of a commitment for private, out-of-home placement. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 41-5-1431, -1512(l)(a), MCA (probation disposition and probation revocation); <em>compare </em>\u00a7 41-5-1512(l)(c), MCA (commitment to youth court for private, out-of-home placement).</p>\n<p id=\"ARd\">\u00b622  Though not technically on probation, a youth committed for private, out-of-home placement under \u00a7 41-5-1512(1)(c), MCA, is nonetheless subject to mandatory supervision by the juvenile probation officer. Section 41-5-1523(2), MCA. Akin to probation conditions, the youth court may impose terms and conditions of supervision incident to a commitment for private, out-of-home placement under \u00a7 41-5-1512(l)(c), MCA. <em>See, e.g., </em>\u00a7 41-5-1512(l)(i), MCA (discretion to order \u201cfurther care, treatment, evaluation, or relief\u2019 beneficial to the youth and community). As with probation conditions, juvenile probation officers have no authority to impose terms and conditions of supervision under a \u00a7 41-5-1512(l)(c), MCA, commitment for private, out-of-home placement. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 41-5-1523(2), (3), -1703(1), (2), MCA (probation officer supervision and case management duties related to private, out-of-home placement).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">\u00b623 Though the Act does not mandate a structured procedure for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>revision or revocation of commitments to the youth court under \u00a7 41-5-1512(l)(c), MCA, the Act nonetheless vests the youth court with broad discretion to \u201cmodify\u201d youth court orders \u201cat any time.\u201d Section 41-5-1422(1), MCA. Commitment to the youth court under \u00a7 41-5-1512(l)(c), MCA, and commitment to DOC for placement at a state youth correctional facility under \u00a7 41-5-1513(l)(b), MCA, are both dispositions available to the youth court upon the original adjudication of a delinquent youth. Therefore, a youth court has continuing jurisdiction and authority pursuant to \u00a7 41-5-1422(1), MCA, to revoke a commitment to the youth court under \u00a7 41-5-1512(l)(c), MCA, and then to recommit the youth to DOC for placement at a state youth correctional facility pursuant to \u00a7 41-5-1513(l)(b), MCA. Exercise of that discretion necessarily requires non-arbitrary findings of fact and conclusions of law warranting the change of disposition under the relevant statutory criteria that would have governed a DOC commitment in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"ahl-dedup-2\">\u00b624  In this case, without citation to a particular dispositional subsection of \u00a7 41-5-1513, MCA, the Youth Court originally committed K. J.R. \u201cto the supervision of the Montana Ninth Judicial District Youth Court\u201d until age of eighteen or \u201csooner released.\u201d If the specified therapeutic group home placement was \u201cnot attainable,\u201d the court authorized the juvenile probation officer to \u201cfind an alternative placement.\u201d The court\u2019s dispositional order did not reference the term \u201cprobation\u201d or impose any probation conditions. In contrast to a probationary disposition under \u00a7\u00a7 41-5-1513(l)(a) and -1512(l)(a), MCA, the original disposition in this case was, as a matter of law, a commitment to the youth court for private, out-of-home placement pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 41-5-1513(l)(a) and -1512(l)(c), MCA. Because he was never on probation, K.J.R. was not subject to a probation revocation under \u00a7 41-5-1431, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">\u00b625 Nonetheless, the Youth Court retained broad discretion under \u00a7 41-5-1422(1), MCA, to revoke K.J.R.\u2019s original youth court commitment under \u00a7 41-5-1512(l)(c), MCA, and then to recommit him to DOC for placement in a youth correctional facility pursuant to \u00a7 41-5-1513(l)(b), MCA. Though the parties led it down the wrong procedural path, the court\u2019s oral and written findings and conclusions, as well as the underlying record, manifest that the Youth Court and supervisingjuvenile probation officer afforded K.J.R. every reasonable opportunity to succeed on supervision under his originally imposed court commitment for private, out-of-home placement. The record further shows that the probation officer, statutory youth court placement committee, and ultimately the Youth Court resorted to a state youth correctional facility placement only after K.J.R. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>demonstrated he was not amenable to supervision in the community over a period of years and multiple alternative placements.</p>\n<p id=\"Az_g\">\u00b626  Though proceeding under the mistaken belief that this case involved a probation disposition subject to probation revocation proceedings under \u00a7 41-5-1431, MCA, the Youth Court clearly had continuing discretionary authority under \u00a7 41-5-1422(1), MCA, to revoke K.J.R.\u2019s original commitment to the Youth Court and to recommit him to DOC for placement at a state youth correctional facility. Aside from correctly pointing out the mistaken procedural characterization, K.J.R. has made no particularized showing that any of the court\u2019s substantive findings of fact or factual considerations were clearly erroneous. K.J.R. similarly has made no showing of prejudice resulting from the mere fact that the court mistakenly characterized the proceeding as a probation revocation proceeding rather than an exercise of its ongoing discretion to modify youth court orders at any time. To the contrary, the record and the court\u2019s orders clearly show that the youth received due notice and opportunity to be heard in opposition to the State\u2019s revocation petition and that the court made a lawful, non-arbitrary decision based on substantial credible evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"AHxO\">\u00b627 This Court will affirm the lower court when it reaches a legally correct result even if it reached the right result for the wrong reason. <em>State v. Ellison, </em>2012 MT 50, \u00b6 8, 364 Mont. 276, 272 P.3d 646 (citation omitted). Therefore, we hold that the Youth Court acted within its lawful authority without abuse of discretion or factual or legal error when it revoked K.J.R.\u2019s original \u00a7 41-5-1512(l)(c), MCA, youth court commitment and recommitted him to DOC for placement at a state youth correctional facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">\u00b628 2. Did counsel for K.J.R. provide ineffective assistance by failing to object to revocation proceedings in the absence of previously imposed probationary conditions?</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">\u00b629 As a matter of Fourteenth Amendment Due Process, a youth has the right to the assistance of counsel during delinquency proceedings when such proceedings may result in commitment to an institution or other curtailment of the youth\u2019s freedom. <em>In re Gault, </em>387 U.S. 1, 41, 87 S. Ct. 1428, 1451 (1967). Ayouth also has a Montana statutory right to counsel in all youth court proceedings. Section 41-5-1413, MCA. The right to counsel necessarily includes the right to effective assistance of counsel. <em>See Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 686, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 2063 (1984) (by implication from the Sixth Amendment in adult criminal proceedings); <em>A.S., </em>\u00b6 20 (as function of due process in child abuse and neglect proceedings).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">\u00b630 Here, the parties ask the Court to evaluate KJ.R.\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim under the two-part test announced in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number><em>Strickland, </em>which requires the defendant to show that counsel\u2019s performance was objectively deficient and resulted in actual prejudice. <em>State v. Notti, </em>2003 MT 296, \u00b6 6, 318 Mont. 146, 79 P.3d 289. Based on its presumption of adequate performance, the <em>Strickland </em>test imposes a heavy burden on the defendant to show that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 690, 104 S. Ct. at 2066.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">\u00b631 An adult criminal defendant\u2019s right to effective assistance of counsel derives from the express federal and Montana constitutional rights to counsel in criminal proceedings. Because a youth court proceeding is a remedial civil proceeding rather than a criminal proceeding, <em>see </em>\u00a7\u00a7 41-5-102, -103(ll)(a), and -106, MCA, a youth court defendant\u2019s right to effective assistance of counsel derives from the federal and Montana constitutional rights to due process. <em>See Gault, </em>387 U.S. at 41, 87 S. Ct. at 1451. To date, this Court has adopted no specific criteria for evaluating youth court ineffective assistance of counsel claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">\u00b632 While the <em>Strickland </em>test continues to be appropriate for adult criminal proceedings, we have previously determined that its highly deferential standard is insufficient to protect the fundamental liberty interests at stake in special civil proceedings that, though analogous to criminal proceedings, involve protective or remedial considerations not present in criminal proceedings. <em>In re Mental Health of K.G.F., </em>2001 MT 140, \u00b6\u00b6 62-65, 306 Mont. 1, 29 P.3d 485 (involuntary mental health commitment proceedings); <em>In re A.S., </em>\u00b6\u00b6 23-25 (child abuse and neglect parental rights termination proceedings). In <em>K.G.F., </em>based on pertinent published guidelines,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> we adopted five non-exclusive evaluation criteria for ineffective assistance of counsel claims in involuntary mental health commitment proceedings. <em>K.G.F., </em>\u00b6\u00b6 70-89. In <em>A.S., </em>similarly based on pertinent published guidelines,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> we adopted two non-exclusive evaluation criteria for ineffective assistance of counsel claims in child abuse and neglect termination proceedings. <em>A.S., </em>\u00b6\u00b6 26-28. More demanding than the <em>Strickland </em>standard but \u201cmore direct\u201d than the <em>K.G.F. </em>criteria, the <em>A.S. </em>criteria focused on:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-7\">(1)... whether counselhas experience andtrainingin representing parents in [child abuse and neglect proceedings] ... and whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>counsel has a verifiably competent understanding of the statutory and case law involving [child abuse and neglect proceedings including parental rights termination proceedings]; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AW0\">(2) ... whether counsel has adequately investigated the case; whether counsel has timely and sufficiently met with the parent and has researched the applicable law; whether counsel has prepared for the termination hearing by interviewing the State\u2019s witnesses and by discovering and reviewing documentary evidence that might be introduced; and whether counsel has demonstrated that he or she possesses trial skills, including making appropriate objections, producing evidence and calling and cross-examining witnesses and experts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b414-5\"><em>A.S., </em>\u00b6 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">\u00b633 In contrast to a criminal proceeding, youth court proceedings are special, remedial, civil proceedings that affect the development and fundamental liberty interests of youth. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 41-5-102, -103(ll)(a), - 106, MCA (nature of youth court proceedings). Under Montana law, youth have the same fundamental Montana constitutional rights as adults. Mont. Const., art. II, \u00a7 15. Although analogous, youth court proceedings involve special considerations and present special challenges to effective representation not present in adult criminal proceedings.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Consequently, we decline to adopt the <em>Strickland </em>test to evaluate youth court ineffective assistance of counsel claims. Moreover, while something similar to our <em>A.S. </em>standard may ultimately be a good fit, we are not inclined to adopt a particular standard for youth court ineffective assistance of counsel claims in this case because the parties have not raised or briefed the issue and the unique facts of this case are amenable to disposition under any objective standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">\u00b634 K.J.R. asserts that counsel performed deficiently by failing to object to the State\u2019s revocation petition on the ground that the youth could not violate probation conditions not imposed by the court. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>further asserts counsel\u2019s omission prejudiced him by resulting in revocation of his community placement and ultimate commitment to DOC for placement in a state youth correctional facility. K.J.R.\u2019s claim is a record-based claim amenable to review on the district court record.</p>\n<p id=\"A2F9\">\u00b635 The record shows counsel for K.J.R. did not object to the State\u2019s incorrectly framed petition. A timely objection may very well have alerted the Youth Court to the correct procedural posture and correspondingly correct characterization of the process and its revocation judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">\u00b636 However, as previously noted, K.J.R. has made no particularized showing that any substantive Youth Court finding of fact or factual consideration was clearly erroneous. K.J.R. has similarly made no showing of any substantial prejudice resulting from the fact that the court mistakenly characterized this matter as a probation revocation matter rather than a consideration of whether to modify K.J.R.\u2019s original Youth Court placement under the court\u2019s continuing modification authority pursuant to \u00a7 41-5-1422(1), MCA. As previously held, the court acted within its lawful authority without abuse of discretion or factual or legal error when it revoked K.J.R.\u2019s original Youth Court commitment and recommitted him to DOC for placement at a state youth correctional facility. Regardless of the alleged deficient performance, K.J.R. has failed to show that counsel\u2019s failure to object to the erroneous characterization of the procedure would have resulted in a different outcome or otherwise prejudiced K.J.R. in any regard. We hold that KJ.R.\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">\u00b637 Regardless of the mistaken characterization of the proceeding as a probation revocation matter, the court acted lawfully without error when it revoked K.J.R.\u2019s original Youth Court commitment and recommitted him to DOC for placement at a state youth correctional facility. KJ.R.\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is without merit. We affirm.</p>\n<judges id=\"b415-8\">JUSTICES SHEA, WHEAT, BAKER and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b407-9\"> Counsel for K.J.R. argued that the Youth Court\u2019s options for disposition were impacted by a 2012 neuropsychological evaluation, which indicated the youth suffered from a mental disorder. However, a mental health evaluation completed at the Cascade County Juvenile Detention Center in 2015 disputed the earlier report. The more recent mental health evaluator stated that K.J.R.\u2019s earlier diagnosis of mental disorder had been ruled out by a clinician in 2012.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b410-9\"> Incorporated by reference to statutory limitations on state youth correctional facility placements. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 41-5-1512(l)(c), -1522, MCA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b413-8\"> National Center for State Courts Institute on Mental Disability and the Law, <em>Guidelines for Involuntary Civil Commitment; </em>10 Mental and Physical Disability Law Reporter, no. 5, 409-514 (1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b413-10\"> National Council of Juvenile and Family Court Judges, <em>Resource Guidelines: Improving Court Practice in Child Abuse &amp; Neglect Cases, </em>22\u201423 (1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b414-8\"> Logic and pertinent national and Montana sources similarly indicate that counsel must have specialized knowledge, skills, and experience in the areas of youth court procedure, substantive youth court law, and in communicating with and counselling the youth.
