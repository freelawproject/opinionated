The statute provides not only for a Court to hear cases relating to such children, but also a probation officer, and such court and officer have the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>control of the custody of children covered by the act. It does not relate to the custody of a child involved in a civil action brought by one parent against the other, where the child has committed no wrong, and is in no danger physically or morally. To construe the words of the statute as giving to the Juvenile Court sole and exclusive jurisdiction in all cases relating to children in New Castle County, without any qualification, would deprive the civil courts of jurisdiction in cases relating to children that are too numerous to mention, a jurisdiction that has long been recognized, and the loss of which would be very surprising. The Court are of the opinion that the Resident Associate Judge of New Castle County had jurisdiction of the case presented to him in the <em>habeas corpus </em>proceedings above mentioned, and the writ of <em>certiorari </em>now before this court should be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">There is another feature of this case, which, while not going to the question of jurisdiction, does present an anomalous situation. The plaintiff in the <em>certiorari </em>not only chose the proceeding he would institute to recover the custody of his child, but selected the forum in which he would have the custody determined. Being disappointed or dissatisfied with the result of his action, he now asks this court to say that the forum he selected had no right to hear his case.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
