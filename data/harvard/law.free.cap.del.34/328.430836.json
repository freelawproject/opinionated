The case is, therefore, within the reason of the rule laid down by the court in <em>Daniel v. Cooper, </em>2 <em>Houst. </em>506.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-17\">While the judgment in that case was for the want of a plea and not for the want of appearance of the defendant, that does not affect the principle involved. <em>Woolley on Del.
