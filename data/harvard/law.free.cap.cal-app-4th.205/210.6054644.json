(Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 361.4.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Agency moved the child from the grandparents\u2019 home and filed a petition under section 387, while the grandfather sought a criminal history exemption that would have allowed the home to be considered as a placement. (\u00a7 361.4, subd. (d)(2).) This exemption request was ultimately denied by the Agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">In an unfortunately protracted and possibly unnecessary proceeding under section 387, the juvenile court reviewed the propriety of the move from the grandparents\u2019 home and the Agency\u2019s decision to deny the grandfather\u2019s criminal records exemption. After a series of hearings over 17 months, the court dismissed the Agency\u2019s section 387 petition and ordered the child placed with her grandparents. The Agency appeals, arguing that the placement order was unauthorized in light of the grandfather\u2019s unexempted criminal history, and that the juvenile court should have granted the section 387 petition. The Agency also argues that the court exceeded its authority by ordering reunification services and transportation assistance to facilitate the transition to the grandparents\u2019 home; that it erred when it found reasonable services had not been provided to the child; and that it should have identified a permanent plan for the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-9\">We agree with the Agency that the juvenile court erred in dismissing the section 387 petition and ordering the child placed with the grandparents. In light of this conclusion, the order requiring the Agency to provide reunification services and transportation assistance must also be set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-10\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND A. <em>Initial Dependency/Family Maintenance Plan</em></p>\n<p id=\"b235-11\">M.L. was bom in July 2008 to T.L. (father) and M.P. (mother), each of whom has a long history of criminal activity and substance abuse. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>parents have six other children, all of whom were living outside the home, and some of whom had been the subjects of juvenile dependency proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">The Agency filed a dependency petition alleging that both mother and M.L. had tested positive for opiates and alcohol at M.L.\u2019s birth; that mother had a history of polysubstance abuse; and that the parents\u2019 other children were living outside the home due to the parents\u2019 drug use, criminal activities and incarcerations. On August 13, 2008, the juvenile court declared M.L. a dependent under section 300, subdivisions (b) and (j), and placed her in the custody of her parents under a family maintenance plan. (\u00a7 362, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">According to the status report prepared by the Agency for the January 2009 review hearing, the parents had to leave their home and were looking for other housing while \u201cliving with relatives when they can.\u201d By the time of the July 2009 status hearing, the family had moved into the home of M.L.\u2019s paternal grandparents, M.P. (grandmother) and D.M. (grandfather). In October 2009, the parents agreed to continue drug testing and treatment and to continue residing with the grandparents as a condition of retaining M.L. in their care.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">B. <em>Section 387 Petition Removing M.L. from the Parents\u2019 Custody</em></p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">On December 10, 2009, the Agency filed a supplemental petition under section 387, alleging that the parents had not complied with drug treatment and testing requirements; that they were no longer living with the paternal grandparents; and that father had been incarcerated in San Quentin prison for theft and drug possession.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The detention report filed by the Agency advised the court that M.L. had been taken from the custody of her parents on December 8, 2009, and was allowed to remain in her grandparents\u2019 home after social worker Eddy Herrera approved an emergency relative placement. The report stated that the grandparents\u2019 home \u201cwill be assessed for relative approval\u201d by Herrera, and \u201c[tjhere is a relative who is able, approved, and willing to care for the children).\u201d On December 8, 2009, grandfather signed a criminal records statement under penalty of perjury in which he denied having been convicted of a crime in California or another jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-9\">At the detention hearing on December 11, 2009, the court removed M.L. from her parents\u2019 custody and \u201c[cjommitted [her] to the care, custody and control of the . . . Agency to be placed in a suitable family home or private institution.\u201d It also adopted certain findings in the detention report, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>included the statement, \u201cthere is a relative who is able, approved, and willing to care for the child(ren).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">The Agency filed a jurisdictional/dispositional report on the section 387 petition reiterating that M.L. had been placed with her grandparents in a relative emergency placement. The report stated that M.L. was doing well in the home of her grandparents, with whom she appeared comfortable and bonded. It characterized the placement as being in the home of \u201can approved relative\u201d (versus an approved nonrelative extended family member, a licensed foster parent, or a licensed emergency foster parent\u2014the other preprinted boxes that could have been checked in that section of the report).</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">A combined jurisdictional/dispositional hearing was held on the section 387 petition on lanuary 13, 2010. The court set aside the previous order placing M.L. with her parents, denied them reunification services, and set the case for a section 366.26 hearing on May 11, 2010, to select a permanent plan. M.L. was \u201c[c]omitted ... to the care, custody and control of the . . . Agency to be placed in a suitable family home or private institution,\u201d and the court adopted findings from the Agency\u2019s report that characterized her current placement as being with \u201can approved relative.\u201d The order also stated that visitation with the grandparents was \u201cappropriate\u201d and was to be arranged at the discretion of the Agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">C. <em>Live Scan Results\u2014Grandfather\u2019s Criminal History</em></p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">As part of the process for approving the grandparents\u2019 home for placement, the Agency conducted a \u201cLive Scan\u201d to investigate their criminal history.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Although grandmother had no criminal history, grandfather\u2019s rap sheet revealed the following: a 1965 conviction for petty theft; a 1969 conviction for driving at an unsafe speed; a 1970 conviction for driving with a suspended license; a 1977 conviction for reckless driving; a 1980 conviction for malicious mischief/vandalism; a 1983 conviction for resisting arrest; a 1995 conviction for possession of a controlled substance; a 2000 conviction for possession of a controlled substance; and various other arrests, including one for domestic violence in February 2009. Under state law, grandfather\u2019s convictions disqualified him as a placement for M.L. unless he obtained a criminal records exemption from the Agency. (See \u00a7 361.4, subd. (d).)</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>D. <em>Second Section 387 Petition and Removal of M.L. from Grandparents\u2019 Home</em></p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">On March 26, 2010, the Agency filed a supplemental section 387 petition alleging that the grandparents were unable to safely care for M.L. in that both of them had used drugs while she was living in their home and grandmother had been diagnosed with a mental health condition that had prevented her from becoming a caretaker for a sibling of M.L.\u2019s who was declared a dependent in Contra Costa County. The petition further alleged, \u201cApproximately four months ago, the paternal grandparents were advised that the paternal grandfather must submit to a standard exemption in order for the home to be cleared for placement. For the past four months, the paternal grandfather has not cooperated with the exemption process.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">The detention report filed in connection with the section 387 petition indicated that M.L. had been taken into protective custody on March 24, 2010, and placed in a licensed foster home. It explained, \u201cOn 3/24/10, a Team-decision Making meeting was held for the purpose of consideration for a change in placement. The primary concern centered around the placement that could not be approved in the home of the paternal grandparents in that the child was placed only on an emergency basis in December 2009. To explain, initially the child was placed with the parents under the condition that they remain in the home of the paternal grandparents, in addition to other requirements set forth in their case plan. About seventeen months after the in-home order, the child was removed from the care of the parents, yet she was allowed to remain in the home of the paternal grandparents. Fast forward to early December 2009 (to date), the paternal grandfather was informed that he must fulfill the process for a Standard Exemption based on his criminal record; however, he never did. In addition, the agency received information from a worker in Contra Costa County alleging ongoing substance abuse by the paternal grandparents, as well as mental health issues on behalf of the paternal grandmother. Last month, the primary worker, Jenaiah Jones, witnessed concerns about the grandparents\u2019 behavior, particularly the paternal grandmother during a recent home visit. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">On March 29, 2010, the court found a prima facie case that removal was necessary (\u00a7 319). On April 22, 2010, the Agency filed an amended supplemental section 387 petition deleting the allegations that the grandparents had used drugs. The grandparents, who sought to have M.L. returned to their home, were granted de facto parent status in May 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">E. <em>First Phase of Hearing on Section 387 Petition</em></p>\n<p id=\"b238-9\">The first portion of the contested hearing on the amended supplemental section 387 petition was held over several days between June 2010 and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>October 2010, while the hearing under section 366.26 (initially set for May 11, 2010) was continued. The following evidence was presented on the section 387 petition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-5\">1. <em>Social Worker Eddy Herrera</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-6\">Eddy Herrera was the social worker responsible for the placement of M.L. with the grandparents after she was detained outside her parents\u2019 custody in early December 2009. He testified that although grandfather had signed a document on December 8, 2009, indicating that he had no criminal history, grandfather had told Herrera that he had some \u201cminor indiscretions years ago.\u201d On December 9, 2009, Herrera did an initial check of the grandparents\u2019 criminal history using CLETS (California Law Enforcement Telecommunications System) and CACI (Child Abuse Central Index), which revealed no \u201chits.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Based on this information, he approved M.L.\u2019s placement in the grandparents\u2019 home on an emergency basis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-7\">Before Herrera could approve the grandparents\u2019 home for a more permanent placement, a Live Scan based on their fingerprints was required. The Scan revealed that grandfather had nine criminal convictions between 1965 and 2000, and an arrest for spousal abuse in 2009. Herrera advised grandfather that his convictions disqualified him as a placement for M.L. unless he obtained a criminal records exemption from the Agency. (See \u00a7 361.4, subd. (d).) Grandfather hired an attorney to assist in this process, but had difficulty obtaining records from some of the older cases, which dated from the 1960\u2019s and 1970\u2019s. Herrera believed grandfather had been cooperative in gathering what information he could, but it was also difficult for the Agency to obtain these records, which came from different jurisdictions. The exemption application had not yet been resolved because the Agency was still gathering information from other jurisdictions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-8\">2. <em>Social Worker Rachael Sims</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-9\">Social worker Rachael Sims testified that M.L. could not be returned to the grandparents\u2019 home because a criminal exemption had not been granted and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>the home had not, therefore, been approved. In her opinion, the document grandfather had submitted to explain his criminal history as part of the exemption process did not show insight.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Sims questioned whether the home was safe, given that grandfather had been arrested in 2009 for domestic violence against grandmother.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-5\">Sims also had concerns about grandmother\u2019s mental health. She had spoken to a social worker in Contra Costa County who thought grandmother was delusional. On the day of the detention hearing on the section 387 petition, grandmother had told Sims that she could not recall whether she had been diagnosed with a mental illness or had received mental health treatment. Grandmother also left Sims a series of incomplete phone messages about M.L.\u2019s pediatrician that were of concern. Sims acknowledged that there were no signs the grandparents had abused M.L., and that hair follicle drug tests had yielded negative results. Grandmother admitted using drugs in the past, but said she had been clean for 10 to 15 years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>3. <em>Social Worker Jenaiah Jones</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-5\">Adoptions worker Jenaiah Jones had been assigned to M.L.\u2019s case from January 2010 to June 2010 and had visited the grandparents\u2019 apartment while M.L. was still living there. Before one of these visits, grandmother called her and said they were low on food and diapers, so Jones got some gift cards before going over. She called grandmother when she arrived at the apartment gate and grandmother said she would come down, but after waiting for about 15 minutes, Jones was let inside by another resident and went up to the apartment. Grandmother answered the door wearing sunglasses and said she and M.L. had been about to take a nap.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-6\">4. <em>SEED Social Worker Benjamin Budnitz</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-7\">Benjamin Budnitz was M.L.\u2019s social worker through the Agency\u2019s SEED program (Services to Enhance Early Development) and supervised visits between M.L. and her grandparents after she was taken from their home. The initial weekly visits were an \u201cemotional rollercoaster\u201d for M.L., who did not respond well to her grandparents. During later visits, M.L. was comforted by having her foster mother in or near the room.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-8\">5. <em>Grandmother</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-9\">Grandmother testified that M.L. had lived with the grandparents for about a year and four months total (including the time that the parents were also in the house) and that she had no specific concerns about MJL.\u2019s development during that time. She took valium for her nerves in 2009 and had received Supplemental Security Income for a nervous condition since 1974, but had never been hospitalized for a psychiatric illness. Asked about the 2009 incident in which grandfather had been arrested for domestic violence, grandmother said that they were having a \u201cdebate\u201d and he had grabbed her arms trying to \u201ccalm [her] down.\u201d She called the police so they would come out and help them with their \u201cdebate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-10\">6. <em>Grandfather</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-11\">When grandfather took the stand, he characterized the 2009 incident leading to his arrest for domestic violence as a \u201cmisunderstanding\u201d that occurred while he was drinking alcohol and had \u201crestrained\u201d his wife. He had sought counseling with his pastor and had otherwise been clean and sober for eight to 10 years. He had completed a drug program while incarcerated in 2003. Grandfather was willing to adopt the minor if necessary, but did not know what would happen with the parents and thought M.L. might return to them if they \u201cgot themselves straight.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>F. <em>Denial of Criminal Records Exemption and Separation of Grandparents</em></p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">In October 2010, while the hearing on the section 387 petition was ongoing, the Agency advised the court that grandfather\u2019s request for a criminal records exemption had been denied. The grandparents sought to challenge this decision as an abuse of discretion, and the court asked the Agency to produce the personnel involved in the exemption process at the next hearing. The Agency objected to the court\u2019s review of its denial of the exemption, arguing that the grandparents were required to exhaust their administrative remedies before seeking judicial review of that decision. The court indicated that it would conduct the review and would not require a section 388 petition to review the Agency\u2019s placement decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">In December 2010, counsel advised the court that grandfather had moved out of his home so that grandmother could obtain custody of M.L. Counsel stated that grandfather was withdrawing his request for placement, though he would still want custody of M.L. if the exemption were ultimately granted. The Agency, joined by minor\u2019s counsel, asked the cotut to grant the section 387 petition based on grandfather\u2019s nonexempt criminal history. The court, finding that grandfather had not been \u201cdragging his feet at all,\u201d stated that the exemption process had been handled \u201cextremely poorly.\u201d It continued the hearing on the section 387 petition, with the section 366.26 hearing to trail.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">G. <em>Removal of M.L. from First Foster Home</em></p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">On December 21, 2010, M.L. was removed from the home of her foster mother and moved to the home of a nonrelative extended family member (the godmother of one of her sisters). The reason for the move was the Agency\u2019s concern that the foster mother had been fabricating the medical symptoms of another child in her care. In a January 2011 hearing on the move from the first foster home, the court was highly critical of the Agency\u2019s delay in notifying the court and minor\u2019s counsel of these concerns, which had arisen before the previous status hearing in M.L.\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-9\">H. <em>Further Proceedings on Section 387 Petition</em></p>\n<p id=\"b242-10\">In a hearing held March 1, 2011, minor\u2019s counsel advised the court that M.L. was doing well in her placement with the second foster mother. Minor\u2019s counsel asked the court to rule on the section 387 petition, indicating that while she did not agree with the Agency\u2019s process, removal from the grandparents\u2019 home had been the correct result and it was not in M.L.\u2019s best interest to delay the proceedings. The court declined to rule on the section 387 petition, and stated that it would allow additional time for investigation. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>Minor\u2019s counsel advised the court that if the evidence on the section 387 petition were being reopened, she would want the court to consider whether M.L. had received appropriate development care in the grandparents\u2019 home, given that M.L. had later been found eligible for regional center services<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> but had not been evaluated while in the grandparents\u2019 care.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">The continued hearing on the section 387 petition commenced on April 15, 2011, and continued until August 2011. Representing the Agency, county counsel noted that while the evidence to date had been different than that alleged in the initial petition, the concerns about the grandparents as caretakers were still the same. Counsel submitted a memo proposing that the court amend the section 387 petition to conform to proof by alleging that grandfather had not obtained an exemption for his criminal history and appeared to still live in the home; that grandmother appeared unstable and had panic attacks; and that the grandparents had minimized or denied an incident of domestic violence that occurred in February 2009, while M.L. was living in the home. Minor\u2019s counsel agreed that the section 387 petition should be sustained, stating that everyone involved in the case had dropped the ball by initially placing M.L. with her grandparents.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">SEED social worker Budnitz testified that grandmother had missed several recent visits with M.L. for health reasons, had given him medical documentation about her congestive heart failure, and had reported having a panic attack. Grandmother had told Budnitz she would like to see M.L. go back to her parents, which concerned him because the parents had unresolved substance abuse issues. Budnitz noted that M.L. had not received regional center services earlier, possibly because the grandparents did not understand her special needs. He did not recommend placement with grandmother due to her health issues, her failure to demonstrate insight into the domestic violence incident of 2009, her limited understanding of M.L.\u2019s developmental needs, and his suspicion that she was still living with grandfather, who had an unexempted criminal history.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">Natalia El-Sheikh, M.L.\u2019s SEED therapist, believed that M.L. suffered from an attachment disorder, but was primarily attached to her current foster mother. She thought that if M.L. were moved to the grandparents\u2019 home she might lose the ability to form healthy attachments, though El-Sheikh could not say with certainty that a change in placement would have a lasting permanent effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">Grandfather testified that he was living at a home for veterans, not with grandmother. He had stopped drinking, was working with a psychologist at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>the Veteran\u2019s Administration, and had received counseling from his pastor about the domestic violence incident in 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">Finally, the court heard the testimony of Michelle Love, the Agency division director who reviewed grandfather\u2019s internal appeal from the denial of the criminal records exemption. She had written to grandfather on December 17, 2010, informing him that the appeal was denied because, \u201cDuring our meeting, you continued to minimize your substance abuse history. Further, despite having completed a substance abuse program you were unable to discuss the issues/circumstances that previously led you to abuse substances and any present coping methods to avoid a recurrence of the same.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">Love explained that she had looked at the totality of the circumstances when reviewing grandfather\u2019s record, including the number of convictions and the inclusion of some acts of violence. She also considered that in his initial application for placement, he claimed not to have had any criminal convictions. In Love\u2019s opinion, grandfather\u2019s written explanation of his criminal history did not show insight, and during their interview, he needed to be prompted by grandmother or his attorney before answering questions. It was difficult for Love to get grandfather to explain the circumstances of his convictions, and he seemed to minimize their seriousness. At this point, grandfather could request a new hearing on the exemption, but could not seek to further appeal the decision with the Agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">I. <em>Status Review Hearing\u2014No Reasonable Services to Minor</em></p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">On June 23, 2011, while the hearing on the section 387 petition was ongoing, the court held a status review hearing and found that the Agency had not provided reasonable services to M.L.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-9\">J. <em>Juvenile Court\u2019s Ruling on Second Section 387 Petition</em></p>\n<p id=\"b244-10\">On August 4, 2011, the juvenile court dismissed the section 387 petition and ordered M.L. placed with the grandparents. It found that M.L. was in an existing relative placement with her grandparents when she was moved from their home in March 2010. It stated that the Agency\u2019s characterization of the initial placement with the grandparents as an emergency placement was \u201calmost a silly distinction\u201d and that the placement had \u201cpractically morphed into a constructive placement.\u201d The court did not find it credible that M.L. was at risk in her grandparents\u2019 home, as evidenced by the fact that the Agency did not remove her for two months after learning of grandfather\u2019s criminal history. It considered the emphasis on the 2009 domestic violence arrest to be \u201cinsulting.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b244-11\">The court stated that it did not matter whether grandfather was still living in the home, because he had cooperated in the exemption process and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>Agency had shown \u201carrogance\u201d in denying the exemption. It found \u201c[T]he whole handling of this case by the Agency was a complete abuse of discretion,\u201d and \u201c[T]he exemption request contains nothing that shouldn\u2019t have been exempted.\u201d The court ordered the Agency to formulate a plan to gradually transition M.L. into the grandparents\u2019 home, and to provide reunification services to the extent they were available. Those services were to include providing transportation passes to the grandparents for visits with M.L.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">A. <em>M.L. Was Placed with Her Grandparents on an Emergency Basis in December 2009, and Could Not Be Permanently Placed in Their Home Without a Criminal Records Exemption.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">Before a child is formally placed in a relative\u2019s home, the social worker must conduct a visit to the home, a criminal records check, and a child abuse index check.

The grandparents contend that no exemption was required in this case, because the minor had been formally placed in their home before grandfather\u2019s criminal history came to light, and section 361.4 applies only when an initial placement is being considered. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>The grandparents rely primarily on <em>Los Angeles County Dept. of Children &amp; Family Services v. Superior Court </em>(2003) 112 Cal.App.4th 509, 519-520 [5 Cal.Rptr.3d 182] <em>(Cheryl </em>M), in which the social services agency filed a section 387 petition to remove three dependent children from a long-term foster care placement with their aunt after the aunt was convicted of criminal offenses. (112 Cal.App.4th at pp. 513-514.) The agency argued that the children should be detained outside the aunt\u2019s home while the petition was pending, because section 361.4 barred their continued placement with a relative who had an unexempted criminal history. (112 Cal.App.4th at p. 514.) The juvenile court denied the request, ruling that section 361.4 did not require the removal of a child in an existing relative placement. (112 Cal.App.4th at pp. 514-515.) The appellate court agreed with this interpretation of section 361.4 and concluded the juvenile court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to detain the children. (112 Cal.App.4th at pp. 520-521.)</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">Section 361.4 did not require the removal of the children in <em>Cheryl M. </em>because they had clearly been placed with their aunt under a permanent plan of long-term foster care. <em>(Cheryl M., supra, </em>112 Cal.App.4th at p. 513.) M.L., by contrast, was temporarily placed in the grandparents\u2019 home on an emergency basis after the Agency filed the first section 387 petition to remove her from her parents\u2019 custody. (See \u00a7\u00a7 361.45, 319, subds. (b), (f)(1) [temporary detention with relatives].) When the court conducted the detention hearing on that first section 387 petition, it did not formally place M.L. with her grandparents, but committed her \u201cto the care, custody and control of the . . . Agency to be placed in a suitable family home or private institution.\u201d The court made an identical order on January 13, 2010, when it sustained the allegations of the section 387 petition and removed M.L. from her parents\u2019 custody. Although the court also adopted portions of the social worker\u2019s report stating that M.L. had been placed with an \u201capproved relative,\u201d other information in the reports makes it clear the placement was made on an emergency basis and that the home was still being investigated.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">Though M.L. continued to reside with her grandparents in an emergency placement, this was not the same thing as an ordered placement with the grandparents. (See <em>In re Cynthia C. </em>(1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1479, 1490 [69 Cal.Rptr.2d 1] <em>(Cynthia </em>C.).) Nor was the emergency placement transformed into a de facto formal placement due to the \u201cmere passage of time.\u201d <em>(Ibid. </em>[agency could move minor from aunt\u2019s home without \u00a7 387 petition when minor had been committed to agency\u2019s custody without a formal relative placement; \u201cmere passage of time\u201d did not give aunt a right to continuing custody or placement]; contra, <em>In re Miguel E. </em>(2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 521, 528, 540-541, 545-546 [15 Cal.Rptr.3d 530] [agency did not have the absolute authority to move a minor who had been formally placed with grandmother].)</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>Under section 361.4, a minor may not be formally placed with a relative until the necessary criminal records check has been performed. Indeed, the failure to perform a criminal records check would render any formal placement with a relative subject to reversal. <em>(In re Sabrina H. </em>(2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1417-1418 [57 Cal.Rptr.3d 863].) Additionally, section 361.45, which provides for emergency placement with a relative, specifically recognizes that a social services agency may withdraw its approval of a relative home for this purpose when it discovers that the relative has a criminal record: \u201cIf a relative or nonrelative extended family member, and other adults in the home, as indicated, meets all other conditions for approval, except for the receipt of a the Federal Bureau of Investigation\u2019s criminal history information ... the county welfare department may approve the home and document that approval, if the relative or nonrelative extended family member, and each adult in the home, has signed and submitted a statement that he or she has never been convicted of a crime in the United States, other than a traffic infraction . ... <em>If, after the approval has been granted, the department determines that the relative or nonrelative extended family member or other adult in the home has a criminal record, the approval may be </em>terminated.\u201d (\u00a7 361.45, subd. (c), italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">On December 8, 2009, grandfather signed and submitted a statement under penalty of perjury that he had not been convicted of a criminal offense, but that statement was discovered to be false when the records check was conducted. Section 361.4 prohibited a formal placement in the grandparents\u2019 home absent an exemption, and section 361.45, subdivision (c) authorized the Agency to withdraw its approval of the grandparents\u2019 home as an emergency placement and move M.L. to a foster home.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">B. <em>The Juvenile Court Did Not Have the Power to Grant a Criminal Records Exemption and Exceeded Its Powers in Placing M.L. with Her Grandparents on August 4, 2011.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">According to the Agency (joined by minor\u2019s appellate counsel), grandfather\u2019s criminal history operates as an absolute bar to placement in the grandparents\u2019 home, because his application for a criminal records exemption was denied. The Agency argues that in placing M.L. with the grandparents on August 4, 2011, the court effectively granted a criminal records exemption, something it lacked the power to do. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">The decision to grant a criminal records exemption is an executive function that lies exclusively with the Agency. <em>(In re S.W. </em>(2005) 131 Cal.App.4th 838, 848 [32 Cal.Rptr.3d 192] (S.W); <em>Sencere P., supra, </em>126 Cal.App.4th at p. 152.) By enacting section 361.4, the Legislature has given the Agency \u201cthe express authority to veto\u201d a placement with a relative who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>has suffered criminal convictions. <em>(David B. v. Superior Court </em>(2004) 123 Cal.App.4th 768, 796-797 [20 Cal.Rptr.3d 336].)</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">Having given the authority to grant an exemption to the Agency, \u201cit is apparent that the Legislature did not intend to confer such authority on the juvenile court.\u201d <em>(Valerie </em>A., <em>supra, </em>87 Cal.App.4th at p. 1167; see also <em>Sencere P., supra, </em>126 Cal.App.4th at p. 152.) Accordingly, the juvenile court may not place a child with a relative who has an unexempted criminal history, even when the court determines that placement would be in the child\u2019s best interests: \u201cThe general \u2018best interest of the child\u2019 standard cannot supplant the specific prohibition in section 361.4. [Citation.] . . . [S]ection 361.4 represents the Legislature\u2019s determination that it would <em>not </em>be in the best interest of the dependent child to be placed with a relative with a disqualifying criminal conviction.\u201d <em>(Valerie A., </em>at p. 1168.)</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">Grandmother suggests that the placement order was proper because grandfather was no longer living in the home and she had no criminal history that disqualified her as a relative caregiver. We disagree for two reasons. First, the juvenile court specifically stated that M.L. would be returned to both grandparents and it did not care whether grandfather had moved out of the home or was only pretending to have done so. Second, the criminal records check under section 361.4 must be performed on \u201cany other person over 18 years of age . . . known to the placing entity who may have significant contact with the child, including any person who has a familial or intimate relationship with any person living in the home.\u201d (\u00a7 361.4, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">By placing M.L. with her grandparents at the conclusion of the section 387 hearing, the juvenile court effectively granted grandfather an exemption after the Agency had declined to do so. In so doing, it exceeded the scope of its powers. <em>(Sencere P., supra, </em>126 Cal.App.4th at p. 151; <em>S.W., supra, </em>131 Cal.App.4th at p. 849; <em>Valerie A., supra, </em>87 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1167-1168.)</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">C. <em>The Juvenile Court\u2019s Determination That the Agency Abused Its Discretion in Denying an Exemption Does Not Authorize Placement with the Grandparents.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b248-9\">During the hearing on the section 387 petition, the juvenile court heard evidence about the exemption process, including testimony by the Agency representative who heard grandfather\u2019s internal appeal. At the conclusion of the hearing, the court stated that the exemption should have been granted by the Agency and that the Agency\u2019s handling of the case had been an abuse of discretion. The grandparents argue that placement in their home was appropriate notwithstanding section 361.4 because the court determined that the exemption process itself was unfair. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>The Agency\u2019s decision to deny a criminal records exemption is an executive one subject to administrative review. (S.W., <em>supra, </em>131 Cal.App.4th at p. 848.) The scope of this administrative review includes a hearing before an administrative law judge if timely requested. (Ibid.; see also Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1522, 1526, 1551; Gov. Code, \u00a7 11502, subd. (a).) The grandparents argue that an applicant whose exemption request has been denied may file a petition for administrative mandamus after exhausting the available administrative remedies. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1094.5; <em>In re Esperanza C. </em>(2008) 165 Cal.App.4th 1042, 1058 [81 Cal.Rptr.3d 556] <em>(Esperanza </em>C.).) They acknowledge that no such petition was filed in this case, but argue that the Agency\u2019s denial of the exemption was an issue properly before the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">In <em>Esperanza C., supra, </em>165 Cal.App.4th at pages 1058-1059, the court recognized that a juvenile court may review an agency\u2019s ruling on an exemption request as part of the dependency proceeding itself, even if no separate writ petition proceeding has been filed. \u201cConsidering the juvenile court\u2019s role as <em>parens patriae, </em>the clear legislative preference for and the child\u2019s interest in relative placement, the urgency of dependency timelines, the lack of a timely, effective remedy for a dependent child and his or her parent through existing administrative regulations and procedures, we hold that the juvenile court may review the agency\u2019s denial of a criminal records exemption for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1060.)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">This does not mean that the juvenile court may substitute its own independent judgment on the exemption for that of the Agency. <em>(Esperanza C., supra, </em>165 Cal.App.4th at p. 1059.) If the court determines that the Agency did abuse its discretion, it may direct it to reconsider the request using the appropriate legal standard, but cannot directly override the request and grant the exemption. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1049-1050.) The juvenile court\u2019s finding in this case that the Agency had abused its discretion did not give it the authority to grant grandfather\u2019s exemption request or place M.L. in the grandparents\u2019 home.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">Moreover, the record in this case does not support a finding that the Agency abused its discretion, and the juvenile court\u2019s comments show that it misapplied the abuse of discretion standard. (See <em>Mark T. </em>v. <em>Jamie R. </em>(2011) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>194 Cal.App.4th 1115, 1127 [124 Cal.Rptr.3d 200].) A review for abuse of discretion must be highly deferential to the decision maker (here, the Agency), and requires a showing that the decision was \u201cso irrational or arbitrary that no reasonable person could agree with it.\u201d <em>(People v. Carmony </em>(2004) 33 Cal.4th 367, 377 [14 Cal.Rptr.3d 880, 92 P.3d 369]; see also <em>Esperanza C., supra, </em>165 Cal.App.4th at p. 1059.) Under the abuse of discretion standard, \u201c \u2018 \u201cWhen two or more inferences can reasonably be deduced from the facts, the [juvenile] court has no authority to substitute its decision for that of the [Agency].\u201d [Citations.]\u2019 \u201d <em>(In re Brittany K. </em>(2005) 127 Cal.App.4th 1497, 1505 [26 Cal.Rptr.3d 487].)</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">In considering grandfather\u2019s request for a criminal records exemption, the Agency was required to \u201cconsider factors including, but not limited to, the following as evidence of good character and rehabilitation: the nature of the crime and whether it involved violence or a threat of violence to others; the period of time since the crime was committed and the number of offenses; circumstances surrounding the commission of the crime that would demonstrate the unlikelihood of repetition; activities since conviction, including employment, therapy or education; a full and unconditional pardon or certificate of rehabilitation; character references; and honesty and truthfulness in the exemption application process.\u201d <em>(Esperanza C., supra, </em>165 Cal.App.4th at p. 1056.) While some of these factors arguably weighed in favor of an exemption (the age of several convictions; the granting of certificates of rehabilitation as to some of them), others did not, including the number of convictions and grandfather\u2019s submission of a form stating he had no criminal history. And, while the juvenile court minimized the significance of grandfather\u2019s arrest for domestic violence in 2009 (a period when M.L. was residing in their home, in her parents\u2019 custody), we cannot say that no reasonable decision maker would have considered this an important factor weighing against an exemption. The juvenile court did not properly apply the abuse of discretion standard to the Agency\u2019s denial of the exemption; rather, it substituted its own judgment that the exemption should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">D. <em>Although a Section 387 Petition May Have Been Unnecessary to Move M.L. from the Grandparents\u2019 Home, Under the Circumstances of the Case, the Juvenile Court Should Have Granted the Agency\u2019s Motion to Amend to Conform to Proof and Granted the Petition.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">The Agency argues that in light of grandfather\u2019s unexempted criminal record, the trial court abused its discretion in dismissing the section 387 petition that sought to move M.L. from her grandparents\u2019 home. It alternatively takes the position (first asserted by minor\u2019s counsel) that because M.L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>had not been formally placed with her grandparents, no section 387 petition was required to move her from that home.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">The argument that no section 387 petition was necessary to move M.L. finds support in <em>Cynthia C., supra, </em>58 Cal.App.4th at pages 1489-1490, in which the court held that no such petition was required to move a child from a relative\u2019s home when there had been no formal placement order. \u201cSection 387 states, \u2018An order <em>changing or modifying a previous order </em>by removing a minor from the physical custody of a parent, guardian, relative, or friend and directing placement in a foster home . . . shall be made only after noticed hearing upon a supplemental petition.\u2019 (Italics added.) Subdivision [(b)] of the statute directs the agency to set forth \u2018a concise statement of facts sufficient to support the conclusion that the <em>previous disposition </em>has not been effective in the . . . protection of the minor.\u2019 (Italics added.) The statute unambiguously governs situations involving an <em>ordered </em>placement which the agency later considers ineffective.\u201d <em>(Cynthia C., </em>at p. 1489.)</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">As we have previously discussed, M.L. was never formally placed with the grandparents. Accordingly, the Agency \u201cwas <em>always </em>authorized to exercise its discretion to reassess the suitability of the environment in which it had placed [M.L.] and, if deemed unsuitable, move [her] to an improved situation.\u201d <em>(Cynthia C., supra, </em>58 Cal.App.4th at p. 1490.) Viewing this case as one in which no section 387 petition was necessary, we would affirm the order dismissing the petition (albeit on different grounds than that asserted by the juvenile court), but reverse the order placing M.L. with her grandparents.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">That said, the Agency elected to proceed via section 387, and we cannot ignore that M.L.\u2019s placement remained in a state of uncertainty while the hearing on that petition was held over a period of 17 months. There is a \u201ctime-honored rule that where the parties and the court proceed throughout the trial upon the theory that a certain issue is presented for adjudication, the doctrine of estoppel precludes [any] party from thereafter asserting that no such issue was in controversy . . . .\u201d <em>(Auer </em>v. <em>Frank </em>(1964) 227 Cal.App.2d 396, 405 [38 Cal.Rptr. 684].) Given its pursuit of an order on the section 387 petition, we deem the Agency estopped from claiming that no such petition was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">Whether the section 387 petition was unnecessary, or whether it was properly filed to obtain court approval of the new foster care placement, the end result\u2014reversal of the order placing M.L. with her grandparents\u2014is the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>same. The amended section 387 petition filed by the Agency on April 22, 2010, which was the operative pleading in this case, alleged in relevant part that grandfather \u201chad not cooperated with all the steps necessary to comply with the exemptions process.\u201d In light of the evidence produced at trial, the Agency asked the court to amend the petition to conform to proof and sustain it based on a finding that, among other things, grandfather had failed to obtain a criminal history exemption. Grandfather\u2019s failure to obtain the exemption was uncontested and rendered the grandparents\u2019 home ineligible as a relative placement. The juvenile court abused its discretion in dismissing the petition as insufficient rather than ordering it amended to conform to proof and sustaining it on its merits. (See <em>In re Jessica C. </em>(2001) 93 Cal.App.4th 1027, 1041-1042 [113 Cal.Rptr.2d 597].)</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">E. <em>The Reversal of the Order Placing M.L. with the Grandparents Makes Reunification Services and Transportation Assistance for the Transition Unnecessary.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">The Agency argues that the juvenile court erred by ordering it to provide reunification services and transportation assistance to facilitate M.L.\u2019s transition back into the grandparent\u2019s home. As we are reversing the placement order under which that transition would have been made, the order requiring services and transportation assistance must be reversed as well. It is unnecessary to consider Agency\u2019s claim that the order was unauthorized in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">F. <em>Issues pertaining to June 23, 2011 Status Review Hearing</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">III.

The current version of section 361.4, and the one in force at all times relevant to this proceeding, allows the county (i.e., the Agency) to issue exemptions. (See <em>Sencere P., supra, </em>126 Cal.App.4th at p. 151, fn. 3.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b249-8\"> In <em>Esperanza C., </em>the challenge to the exemption process was raised in the dependency proceeding via a petition for modification under section 388. <em>(Esperanza C., supra, </em>165 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1049, 1051.) In this case, the juvenile court specifically stated that it would not require a petition under section 388. As no party has challenged the procedural vehicle for presenting the exemption issue, we assume, without deciding, that it was properly considered as a defense of sorts to the Agency\u2019s petition under section 387.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b252-10\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 210.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
