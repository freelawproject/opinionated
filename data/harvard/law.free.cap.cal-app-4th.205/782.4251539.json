J.</author>\n<p id=\"AVo\">Plaintiffs in these consolidated actions appeal from judgments on the pleadings in favor of defendant Hennessy Industries, Inc. (Hennessy), the manufacturer of a brake arcing machine. Each of the plaintiffs alleged Hennessy\u2019s machine was designed and used exclusively for the purpose of shaping, by grinding action, brake linings that were manufactured by others, but contained asbestos fibers that were dangerously released into the air by the normal action of Hennessy\u2019s machine. The trial court ruled that, because Hennessey\u2019s machine itself was not made with asbestos and Hennessy did not itself manufacture or distribute any product made with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>asbestos, plaintiffs had not, and could not, plead a viable cause of action against Hennessy for negligence or strict products liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">As discussed below, we conclude, in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>O\u2019Neil </em>v. <em>Crane Co. </em>(2012) 53 Cal.4th 335 [135 Cal.Rptr.3d 288, 266 P.3d 987] <em>{O\u2019Neil), </em>as well as earlier Court of Appeal decisions including <em>Taylor v. Elliott Turbomachinery Co. Inc. </em>(2009) 171 Cal.App.4th 564 [90 Cal.Rptr.3d 414] <em>{Taylor), </em>and <em>Tellez-Cordova </em>v. <em>Campbell-Hausfeld/Scott Fetzger Co. </em>(2004) 129 Cal.App.4th 577 [28 Cal.Rptr.3d 744] <em>{Tellez-Cordova), </em>plaintiffs have pleaded viable causes of action for negligence and strict liability for purposes of overcoming a motion for judgment on the pleadings. Accordingly, we reverse and remand these actions for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">Leonard Shields alleged he worked predominantly as a mechanic and suffered exposure to asbestos resulting in injuries, including asbestos-related pleural disease diagnosed in 1994, asbestosis diagnosed in 1996, and lung cancer diagnosed in 2008. The other plaintiffs pleaded similar work experience as mechanics, ironworkers, or pipefitters, with similar exposure to asbestos and similar injuries.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">Each of the plaintiffs\u2019 complaints, filed between July 2008 and May 2010, named numerous defendants including Hennessy. All plaintiffs are represented by the same law firm, which in 2003 had filed a \u201cMaster Complaint\u201d pursuant to general order No. 55-\u2014issued by the trial court in 1996\u2014which allowed the use of master pleadings in asbestos litigation. Each complaint thus incorporated most, if not all, of its causes of action from the firm\u2019s Master Complaint, designating the defendants to which each incorporated cause of action applied. The five complaints pleaded four or five causes of action against Hennessy in this manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-8\">Of these incorporated causes of action, two in each complaint are referred to as the Master Complaint\u2019s \u201cBrake Shoe Grinding Machine\u201d causes of action\u2014one based on negligence and the other on strict products liability. These two commonly pleaded causes of action are the focus of all five appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-9\">In June and July 2010, Hennessy filed motions for judgment on the pleadings against each of plaintiffs\u2019 complaints. Between late July and late <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>November of that year, the trial court held hearings on these motions, granted judgment on the pleadings and denied leave to amend. In each case, the court subsequently entered judgment in favor of Hennessy.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">Each of the plaintiffs appealed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (See Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 904.1, subd. (a)(1).)</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">I. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b715-8\">Each of the plaintiffs contends the trial court erred in granting Hennessy\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings and in denying leave to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-9\">The standard for granting a motion for judgment on the pleadings is essentially the same as that applicable to a general demurrer. The trial court determines whether it appears from the pleadings, together with matters that may be judicially noticed, the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. We review the trial court\u2019s determination de novo. In doing so, we assume the truth of, and liberally construe all properly pleaded factual allegations in the complaint. <em>(Bezirdjian </em>v. <em>O\u2019Reilly </em>(2010) 183 Cal.App.4th 316, 321 [107 Cal.Rptr.3d 384] <em>(Bezirdjian).) </em>In determining whether the pleadings entitle the moving party to judgment as a matter of law, we conduct the appropriate analysis without deferring to the reasoning of the trial court. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 322.)</p>\n<p id=\"b715-10\">We review the trial court\u2019s denial of leave to amend for abuse of discretion, which the plaintiffs must establish by offering proposed amendments to this court that state a legally sufficient cause of action. <em>(Palm Springs Tennis Club v. Rangel </em>(1999) 73 Cal.App.4th 1, 7-8 [86 Cal.Rptr.2d 73].)</p>\n<p id=\"b715-11\">II. <em>The Pleadings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b715-12\">In reviewing the two \u201cBrake Shoe Grinding Machine\u201d causes of action at issue, we focus on the proposed amended version submitted to the trial court by each of the plaintiffs in early September 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-13\">Hennessy has objected, with respect to three of the five consolidated appeals, that plaintiffs may not rely on the proposed amended version, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>because plaintiffs did not present the proposed amendments to the trial court <em>before </em>it made its ruling granting the motion for judgment on the pleadings without leave to amend.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It is evident, however, in these cases plaintiffs adequately presented to the court the gist of these proposed amendments in arguing against the motion for judgment on the pleadings.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In any event, when a judgment on the pleadings is sustained without leave to amend, an appellant may argue for the first time on appeal the complaint may be amended to state a valid cause of action\u2014based on the general rule that a litigant may raise for the first time on appeal a pure question of law based on undisputed facts. <em>(Dudley </em>v. <em>Department of Transportation </em>(2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 255, 259-260 [108 Cal.Rptr.2d 739].) In other words, the appellant may assert the trial court abused its discretion in granting the motion without leave to amend, and it is not a prerequisite to this assertion the appellant first presented to the trial court a specific request to amend or an indication of its legal basis. <em>(Galligan </em>v. <em>City of San Bruno </em>(1982) 132 Cal.App.3d 869, 876 [183 Cal.Rptr. 466].)</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">The proposed amended version of the first \u201cBrake Shoe Grinding Machine\u201d cause of action\u2014grounded on negligence\u2014alleged Hennessy was engaged in the design, manufacture, and distribution of \u201casbestos brake shoe grinding machines.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">Hennessy \u201cnegligently . . . manufactured [and] designed . . . certain asbestos brake shoe grinding machines ... in that [these machines], while being used in a manner that was reasonable, failed to protect users . . . and others, including the plaintiff . . . from exposure to and inhalation and ingestion of asbestos fibers caused to be released from asbestos-containing brake liningfs] by the intended use of the asbestos brake shoe grinding machines . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">Hennessy \u201cknew or should have known, and intended, that the . . . brake shoe grinding machines . . . would be used by consumers, workers, bystanders, and others, including [plaintiff] in conjunction with asbestos-containing brake linings.\u201d \u201cDuring all relevant time periods, all brake shoe linings used with or on automobiles, light trucks and commercial trucks, as serviced by [Hennessy\u2019s] products in the United States contained asbestos.\u201d \u201cUntil subjected to [Hennessy\u2019s] products, asbestos fiber bundles were physically bound <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>or otherwise attached in a matrix in the non-friable asbestos brake lining[s].\u201d Hennessy\u2019s \u201casbestos brake shoe grinding machine[s] . . . ground and abraded th[e] hard lining[s], as they were designed to do, and subjected [them] to pressures, temperatures and force inadequate to convert asbestos into inert forsterite, making portions of [the linings] into a fine powder and releasing the formerly bound-up asbestos into the air as airborne fibers that presented a significant danger to human health, as they would be breathed in by anyone in the area around the . . . machine during or after its use.\u201d The \u201conly intended use\u201d of these machines was \u201cfor grinding brake shoe linings, in order to match the size and shape between the shoe and [brake] drum . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">Hennessy \u201cknew, or should have known, that [its] brake shoe grinding machines would be used on asbestos-containing brake linings and, when used in the manner intended, would cause the release of asbestos fibers into the air around the users and bystanders, and others, including the plaintiff . . . and create a hazard from [the machines\u2019] intended and only use.\u201d Hennessy \u201cspecifically designed [its] machines for grinding asbestos-containing brake linings [and they] had no other function than to grind asbestos-containing brake linings.\u201d This was \u201c[t]hus [the] only \u2018inevitable use\u2019 of the machines, within the meaning of <em>Tellez-Cordova v.

In supplemental briefing, plaintiffs further urge that the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>O\u2019Neil, supra, </em>53 Cal.4th 335, also supports this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">B. <em>Tellez- Cordova</em></p>\n<p id=\"b718-8\">In <em>Tellez-Cordova, </em>the court conducted an analysis of a ruling sustaining a general demurrer involving a similar issue. <em>(Tellez-Cordova, supra, </em>129 Cal.App.4th at p. 579.) The primary plaintiff<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> in that case worked as a lamp maker, using various power tools manufactured by the defendants to saw, grind, and sand metal parts. He developed interstitial pulmonary fibrosis as a result of exposure to airborne toxic substances produced and released from both the metal parts and from discs, belts, and wheels that were attached to and used with the defendants\u2019 saws, grinders, and sanders. Among other things, the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint attempted to state\u2014as in the cases before us\u2014causes of action for negligence and strict liability based on design defect (as well as failure to warn). (129 Cal.App.4th at p. 579.) The complaint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>alleged that the defendants\u2019 power tools were designed specifically for use with wheels or discs \u201c \u2018for the intended purpose of grinding and sanding metals,\u2019 \u201d that the tools \u201c \u2018necessarily operated\u2019 \u201d with wheels or discs made of aluminum oxide and other inorganic material, and that when the tools were used for their intended purpose they generated a breathable metallic dust composed of both the metal being abraded and the material that comprised the abrasive wheels and discs attached to defendants\u2019 tools. It also alleged defendants were aware of this danger while the primary plaintiff was not. As liberally construed by the reviewing court, the complaint additionally alleged that the abrasive wheels and discs did not \u201ccreate respirable metallic dust unless they were used with [defendants\u2019] power tools, because it [was] the speed and force of those tools [that caused] the dust to become airborne.\u201d The alleged design defect in the tools was their lack of any exhaust ventilation system necessary to prevent or minimize the release of metallic or inorganic dusts during the intended use of the tools. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 580.) The defendants demurred on the ground that the harmful airborne metallic dust was caused by the wheel, disc, or belt attachments, and not by their power tools. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 581.)</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">The Court of Appeal reversed the judgment in favor of the defendants, holding the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint alleged sufficient causes of action for negligence and strict liability. <em>(Tellez-Cordova, supra, </em>129 Cal.App.4th at p. 588.) In relevant part, the court rejected the defendants\u2019 argument that they were not liable under the \u201ccomponent parts doctrine\u201d\u2014that is, the doctrine that the manufacturer of a nondefective component part is not liable for defects in the final product over which it had no control. The court reasoned the complaint did not allege that the defendants\u2019 tools were component parts that could be used in a variety of finished products, but rather were specifically designed to be used with the abrasive wheels or discs that the plaintiff used with the tools, for the sole intended purpose of grinding and sanding metals. The tools were thus \u201cnecessarily operated\u201d with those wheels or discs, the wheels and discs were harmless without the power supplied by the tools, and only when the tools were used as intended was harmful metallic dust released into the air. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 581-582.) The court further noted the principal policy reasons underlying the component parts doctrine were not applicable. As the complaint alleged the defendants\u2019 tools had only one intended use, the defendants were not required to anticipate and incorporate safety measures that might be unnecessary for some uses of their tools. Nor was there, under the allegations, any other finished product that incorporated or adapted the tools, such that there was a finished product manufacturer that stood in a better position than the defendants to understand and protect against any risk of harm posed by the tools\u2019 special adaptation into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>another, completed product.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Rather, it was alleged the defendants\u2019 tools were directly used for their intended purpose by consumers such as the primary plaintiff. (129 Cal.App.4th at pp. 582-583.) The court rejected the proposition the defendants could not foresee what attachment might be used with their tools, nor what surface to which the attachment might be applied, given the allegation that the \u201cinevitable use\u201d of the tools was with the specified wheels and discs to grind or sand metals. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 584.)</p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">C. <em>Taylor</em></p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">In the <em>Taylor </em>decision, involving a component part issue, the primary plaintiff suffered exposure to asbestos-containing products while serving aboard a United States Navy aircraft carrier. The defendants had furnished the various pieces of equipment to the United States Navy that were placed in the carrier when it was first commissioned during World War II, some of which included parts\u2014such as gaskets, packing, and insulation\u2014containing asbestos. The asbestos-containing parts to which that plaintiff had been exposed during his service in the 1960\u2019s, however, had been supplied not by the defendants, but by other manufacturers. The plaintiffs, the former naval serviceman and his wife, sought damages based, among other causes of action, on theories of negligence and strict liability due to the defendants\u2019 failure to warn of the dangers inherent in asbestos-containing materials. <em>(Taylor, supra, </em>171 Cal.App.4th at pp. 570-571, 572, 574.) The trial court granted summary judgment as to most of the defendants on the ground that a manufacturer\u2019s duty to warn extended only to the manufacturer\u2019s own products. Division Five of this court affirmed, holding that California law imposed no duty on these defendants to warn of the hazards inherent in defective products manufactured or supplied by third parties. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 571.)</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">The primary plaintiff died during the pendency of the action, but his surviving wife contended on appeal that the defendants were negligently or strictly liable for failing to warn of the dangers inherent in the asbestos-containing gaskets, packing, and other parts that were used \u201cin conjunction\u201d or \u201cin combination\u201d with the defendants\u2019 equipment. <em>(Taylor, supra, </em>171 Cal.App.4th at p. 574.) Thus, the court\u2019s focus in reviewing strict liability was limited to failure to warn, and did not encompass defects in the defendants\u2019 own manufacturing or design. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 577.)</p>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">The Court of Appeal concluded the defendants were not strictly liable for failure to warn under the \u201ccomponent parts\u201d doctrine, among other reasons. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>The court described the doctrine as one under which \u201cthe manufacturer of a product component is not liable for injuries caused by the finished product into which the component is incorporated^] unless the component itself was defective at the time it left the manufacturer.\u201d <em>(Taylor, supra, </em>171 Cal.App.4th at p. 584, citations omitted; see Rest.3d Torts, Products Liability, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 5, com. a, p. 130.) Viewing the defendants as component parts manufacturers, whose products had been integrated by the United States Navy into the carrier\u2019s propulsion system without the defendants\u2019 participation, the court reasoned it was not the defendants\u2019 equipment that had released the asbestos fibers to which the deceased plaintiff had been exposed, but rather the gaskets, packing, and other asbestos-containing components manufactured by others and installed long after the defendants supplied their equipment. (Taylor, <em>supra, </em>at p. 585.)</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">The Court of Appeal distinguished the earlier decision in <em>Tellez-Cordova </em>because it involved a situation where the manufacturer\u2019s product itself caused or created the risk of harm when it was used in a reasonably foreseeable manner in combination with another manufacturer\u2019s product. <em>(Taylor, supra, </em>171 Cal.App.4th at pp. 586-588.) That decision did not, in other words, impose \u201ca duty to warn <em>solely </em>of the hazards of other manufacturers\u2019 products.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 588.) By contrast, the injuries at issue in <em>Taylor </em>were caused by the release of asbestos fibers from other parts manufactured by others, not by any action of the defendants\u2019 equipment. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 587.) The operative principle framed by the court was that \u201ca manufacturer <em>may </em>owe a duty to warn when the use of its product in combination with the product of another creates a potential hazard, [but] that duty arises <em>only </em>when the manufacturer\u2019s own product causes or creates the risk of harm.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 580, original italics.)</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">D. <em>O\u2019Neil</em></p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">The facts presented to the Supreme Court in <em>O\u2019Neil </em>were similar to those at issue in <em>Taylor, </em>involving component parts. The defendants in <em>O\u2019Neil, </em>like those in <em>Taylor, </em>manufactured valves and pumps by specification for incorporation into the propulsion systems of United States Navy warships as they were first built during World War II. The plaintiffs brought a wrongful death action against them, based on their decedent\u2019s exposure to asbestos fibers while serving aboard one of those ships. Other manufacturers had made the asbestos gaskets, packing, and insulation that were incorporated into, or used with, the valves and pumps made by the defendants, but the plaintiffs claimed they were, nevertheless, strictly liable and negligent because it was reasonably foreseeable workers would be exposed to asbestos contained in replacement parts used in conjunction with the defendants\u2019 equipment. <em>(O\u2019Neil, supra, </em>53 Cal.4th at pp. 342-343, 345.)</p>\n<p id=\"b722-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>The plaintiffs\u2019 evidence showed the decedent had served on a United States Navy aircraft carrier between 1965 and 1967, supervising enlisted men who serviced equipment in the carrier\u2019s steam propulsion system rooms. The decedent was exposed to the asbestos fibers released into the air by the action of those repairing or replacing asbestos-containing materials, which included not only gaskets and packing used within the defendants\u2019 valves and pumps, but also vast amounts of insulation that externally covered the propulsion system\u2019s miles of pipes, as well as its mechanisms. Some 40 years after his service on the aircraft carrier, the decedent was diagnosed with mesothelioma, a fatal cancer caused by asbestos exposure, and died the following year.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>(O\u2019Neil, supra, </em>53 Cal.4th at pp. 343, 345-346.)</p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">The defendants in <em>O\u2019Neil </em>made and supplied valves and pumps to the United States Navy, for incorporation into the aircraft carrier\u2019s initial propulsion system, more than 20 years before the decedent served on that craft. <em>{O\u2019Neil, supra, </em>53 Cal.4th at pp. 343-345.) They built this equipment to comply with design specifications provided by the United States Navy\u2019s Bureau of Ships, which required the inclusion of asbestos-containing gaskets and packing. <em>{Id. </em>at pp. 343-344.) Although the United States Navy\u2019s specifications required the initial inclusion of asbestos-containing gaskets and packing in the valves and pumps, neither defendant made these materials, but purchased them from United States Navy-approved vendors. There was also no evidence that the valves and pumps required the use of gaskets or packing made from asbestos in order to function properly, as distinguished from their use to comply with naval specifications. <em>{Id. </em>at p. 344.)</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">At the close of evidence, the defendants moved for nonsuit on all of the plaintiffs\u2019 causes of action, on the ground there was no evidence the decedent had been exposed to asbestos from any product they had manufactured, nor evidence that any product defect or failure to warn on their part was a substantial factor in causing the decedent\u2019s fatal cancer. The trial court granted their motions and dismissed all claims against the defendants. The court concluded, among other things, that the \u201ccomponent parts\u201d doctrine shielded the defendants from liability because the United States Navy had integrated the defendants\u2019 nondefective valves and pumps into a larger \u201csophisticated system\u201d without the defendants\u2019 participation. <em>{O\u2019Neil, supra, </em>53 Cal.4th at p. 346.)</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">In reversing the contrary decision of the Court of Appeal, the Supreme Court affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment. <em>{O\u2019Neil, supra, </em>53 Cal.4th at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>p. 366.) Examining the evidence relating to the plaintiffs\u2019 claim of strict liability, the court reached two conclusions: (1) the defendants were not strictly liable for the decedent\u2019s injuries because \u201cany design defect in <em>defendants\u2019 products </em>was not a legal cause of injury\u201d to the decedent, and (2) the defendants were not strictly liable for failure \u201cto warn of risks arising from <em>other manufacturers\u2019 </em>products.\u201d <em>{Id. </em>at p. 348, original italics.)</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">In explaining the first conclusion\u2014that the defendants were not strictly liable because a defect in their own equipment was not a legal cause of the decedent\u2019s injury\u2014the Supreme Court noted that strict products liability under California law, beginning with its decision in <em>Greenman v. Yuba Power Products, Inc. </em>(1963) 59 Cal.2d 57 [27 Cal.Rptr. 697, 377 P.2d 897], had always been limited to \u201charm caused by deficiencies in the defendant\u2019s own product.\u201d <em>{O\u2019Neil, supra, </em>53 Cal.4th at p. 348.) Whereas a defendant manufacturer may be strictly liable for its own defective, finished product, even when the defect is traceable to a defective component party supplied by another manufacturer, strict liability has never been held to encompass the \u201charm from entirely distinct products that the consumer can be expected to use with, or in, [a] defendant\u2019s nondefective product.\u201d <em>{Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">In accordance with this principle, the court had articulated the \u201cchain of distribution\u201d doctrine in <em>Peterson </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1995) 10 Cal.4th 1185 [43 Cal.Rptr.2d 836, 899 P.2d 905] <em>{Peterson), </em>limiting strict liability to \u201cthose entities responsible for placing a defective product into the stream of commerce.\u201d Other entities \u201coutside the marketing enterprise,\u201d who generally had no continuing relationship with the manufacturer of the defective product, were in no position either to exert pressure on that manufacturer to make its product safe, or to share with that manufacturer the costs of insuring the safety of the defective product\u2019s users. <em>{O\u2019Neil, supra, </em>53 Cal.4th at p. 349.)</p>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">In <em>O\u2019Neil, </em>the evidence indicated the decedent suffered exposure to asbestos in the 1960\u2019s from the external insulation and from replacement gaskets and packing that were in place at that time. It did not show, however, either that the defendants manufactured, sold, or advised the use of the external insulation, or that they had manufactured or sold the gaskets or packing the United States Navy had used in the 1960\u2019s to replace the original component parts the defendants had purchased from others and installed in their valves and pumps. <em>{O\u2019Neil, supra, </em>53 Cal.4th at pp. 345, 349.) The court concluded that, although the internal gaskets and packing originally supplied with the defendants\u2019 products contained asbestos, none of these original parts remained on the carrier when the decedent arrived decades later. Thus, \u201ceven <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>assuming the inclusion of asbestos makes a product defective,\u201d it was not any defect in the defendants\u2019 equipment, as supplied, that had been the legal cause of the decedent\u2019s injuries. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 349-350.)</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">The court in <em>O\u2019Neil </em>rejected the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that the defendants\u2019 products were defective because they had been \u201c \u2018designed to be used\u2019 \u201d with asbestos-containing components, concluding it was not supported by the record. The evidence showed, rather, that the defendants\u2019 valves and pumps were \u201cdesigned to meet the [United States] Navy\u2019s specifications,\u201d and there was no evidence\u2014\u201c[a]part from the [United States] Navy\u2019s specifications\u201d\u2014 that the defendants\u2019 products <em>\u201crequired </em>asbestos-containing gaskets or packing in order to function.\u201d <em>(O\u2019Neil, supra, </em>53 Cal.4th at p. 350, original italics.) The \u201cmere compatibility\u201d of the defendants\u2019 valves and pumps with asbestos-containing components was \u201cnot enough to render them defective.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> (53 Cal.4th at p. 350.)</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">Turning to its conclusion that the defendants were not strictly liable for failure to warn of risks arising from other manufacturers\u2019 products\u2014the court began with the general rule formulated in its decision in <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Owens-Coming Fiberglas Corp. </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 987, 1003 [281 Cal.Rptr. 528, 810 P.2d 549]\u2014that is, manufacturers have a strict liability duty to warn consumers about the hazards inherent in their own products. <em>(O\u2019Neil, supra, </em>53 Cal.4th at p. 351.) The court noted, however, it has never held that a manufacturer\u2019s strict liability duty to warn \u201cextends to hazards arising exclusively from <em>other </em>manufacturers\u2019 products.\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>original italics.)</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">The court considered three Court of Appeal decisions, as well as several decisions from other jurisdictions, and found them to be in accord with its own conclusion. <em>(O\u2019Neil, supra, </em>53 Cal.4th at pp. 351-353; see <em>Powell v. Standard Brands Paint Co. </em>(1985) 166 Cal.App.3d 357 [212 Cal.Rptr. 395]; <em>Blackwell v. Phelps Dodge Corp. </em>(1984) 157 Cal.App.3d 372 [203 Cal.Rptr. 706]; <em>Garman v.

Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. </em>(1992) 79 N.Y.2d 289 [582 N.Y.S.2d 373, 591 N.E.2d 222].)</p>\n<p id=\"b725-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>The Supreme Court focused primarily on the decision in <em>Taylor </em>which had \u201caddressed the very question presented\u201d to itself. <em>(O\u2019Neil, supra, </em>53 Cal.4th at p. 353.) The court summarized, with evident agreement, the analysis utilized in the <em>Taylor </em>decision, in reaching its conclusion, under almost identical circumstances, that the defendants were not strictly liable for their failure to warn of the danger posed by the asbestos contained in component parts made by others and used in conjunction with their own products. <em>(O\u2019Neil, supra, </em>53 Cal.4th at pp. 354-355.)</p>\n<p id=\"b725-4\">The court in <em>O\u2019Neil </em>noted, first, that the <em>Taylor </em>decision held there was no strict liability for the defendants\u2019 failure to warn under the \u201c \u2018[c]hain of distribution\u2019 \u201d doctrine enunciated in <em>Peterson, supra, </em>10 Cal.4th 1185, that is, the defendants had not been responsible \u201cfor placing . . . into the stream of commerce\u201d the component parts that had caused injury to the deceased plaintiff. <em>(O\u2019Neil, supra, </em>53 Cal.4th at p. 354; see <em>Taylor, supra, </em>171 Cal.App.4th at pp. 576, 579.)</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">Second, as discussed above, the <em>Taylor </em>court held California law did not impose strict liability for failure to warn of \u201c \u2018defects in products supplied by others and used in conjunction with the manufacturer\u2019s product unless the manufacturer\u2019s product itself causes or creates the risk of harm.\u2019 \u201d <em>(O\u2019Neil, supra, </em>53 Cal.4th at p. 354, quoting <em>Taylor, supra, </em>171 Cal.App.4th at pp. 575, 580-583.) The court in <em>O\u2019Neil </em>reiterated with approval the principle formulated in <em>Taylor </em>that \u201c \u2018[a] manufacturer <em>may </em>owe a duty to warn when the use of its product in combination with the product of another creates a potential hazard, [but] that duty arises <em>only </em>when the manufacturer\u2019s own product causes or creates the risk of harm.\u2019 \u201d <em>(O\u2019Neil, supra, </em>53 Cal.4th at p. 355, original italics, quoting <em>Taylor, supra, </em>171 Cal.App.4th at p. 580.)</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">Third, the court in <em>Taylor </em>held strict liability for failure to warn was additionally precluded under the \u201ccomponent parts\u201d doctrine. The Supreme Court in <em>O\u2019Neil </em>expressed this doctrine as one providing \u201cthat the manufacturer of a component part is not liable for injuries caused by the finished product into which the component has been incorporated unless the component itself was defective and caused harm.\u201d <em>(O\u2019Neil, supra, </em>53 Cal.4th at p. 355, citing <em>Taylor, supra, </em>171 Cal.App.4th at pp. 584-586.) The Court of Appeal in <em>Taylor </em>found this doctrine applicable because\u2014as in the case before the court in O\u2019Neil\u2014the evidence established neither that the defendants\u2019 components caused the injuries in issue, nor that the defendants had participated in the integration of their pumps and valves into the carrier\u2019s propulsion system. <em>(O\u2019Neil, supra, </em>53 Cal.4th at p. 355, citing <em>Taylor, supra, </em>171 Cal.App.4th at pp. 584-585.)</p>\n<p id=\"b726-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>However, most pertinent to the issue before us, the Supreme Court in <em>O\u2019Neil </em>distinguished and did not disapprove the decision in <em>Tellez-Cordova. </em>The court found the holding in <em>Tellez-Cordova </em>did \u201cnot create a broader duty for manufacturers to warn about hazards arising solely from other products.\u201d <em>(O\u2019Neil, supra, </em>53 Cal.4th at p. 360.) The court concluded, rather, the decision in <em>Tellez-Cordova </em>rested on two alleged facts not present in <em>O\u2019Neil: </em>the defendants\u2019 power tools in <em>Tellez-Cordova </em>\u201ccould <em>only </em>be used in a potentially injury-producing manner,\u201d and it was the action of the defendants\u2019 power tools themselves \u201cthat <em>caused </em>the release of harmful dust, even though the dust itself emanated from another substance.\u201d <em>(O\u2019Neil, supra, </em>53 Cal.4th at p. 361, original italics.)</p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\"><em>O\u2019Neil </em>acknowledged that the duty to warn articulated by the Court of Appeal in <em>Tellez-Cordova, </em>was \u201cappropriate\u201d under the unique facts presented to the Court of Appeal in that case, when \u201cthe defendant\u2019s product was intended to be used with another product <em>for the very activity that created a hazardous situation.\u201d (O\u2019Neil, supra, </em>53 Cal.4th at p. 361, original italics.) As the court put it, when \u201cthe intended use of a product inevitably creates a hazardous situation, it is reasonable to expect the manufacturer to give warnings . . . [but when] the hazard arises entirely from another product, and the [manufacturer\u2019s] product does not create or contribute to that hazard, liability is not appropriate.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 361-362.)</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">Concluding its analysis, and rejection, of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim in <em>O\u2019Neil </em>that the defendants were strictly liable for their failure to warn about the dangers of asbestos present in the replacement component parts manufactured by others, the Supreme Court \u201creaffirm[ed] that a product manufacturer generally may not be held strictly liable for harm caused by another manufacturer\u2019s product,\u201d <em>except </em>\u201cwhen the defendant bears some direct responsibility for the harm,\u201d as when, in <em>Tellez-Cordova, </em>\u201cthe defendant\u2019s own product contributed substantially to the harm,\u201d or when \u201cdefendant participated substantially in creating a harmful combined use of the products.\u201d <em>(O\u2019Neil, supra, </em>53 Cal.4th at p. 362.)</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">From this careful analysis, the Supreme Court in <em>O\u2019Neil </em>formulated this principle: \u201ca product manufacturer may not be held liable in strict liability or negligence for harm caused by another manufacturer\u2019s product <em>unless the defendant\u2019s own product contributed substantially to the harm, or the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number><em>defendant participated substantially in creating a harmful combined use of the products.\u201d (O\u2019Neil, supra, </em>53 Cal.4th at p. 342, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">IV. <em>Analysis and Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">We are mindful the plaintiffs in these consolidated appeals are but a few of many injured by their exposure to asbestos-containing products, who are seeking redress for their injuries from increasingly peripheral defendants, as the more principal manufacturers and suppliers of asbestos-containing products seek the protection of bankruptcy. (See <em>O\u2019Neil, supra, </em>53 Cal.4th at p. 354, fn. 9.) We also recognize the public policies that weigh against any expansion of liability for such injuries, under the principles that govern both strict liability and liability for negligence. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 362-363, 364-366.) Nevertheless, we have examined independently plaintiffs\u2019 causes of action for strict liability and negligence, summarized above, assuming the truth of their factual allegations. <em>(Bezirdjian, supra, </em>183 Cal.App.4th at p. 321.)</p>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">We conclude from <em>O\u2019Neil\u2019s </em>explication that plaintiffs\u2019 causes of action are sufficient to withstand a motion for judgment on the pleadings. Plaintiffs alleged, essentially, Hennessy designed, manufactured and sold a machine whose <em>only </em>purpose and \u201c \u2018inevitable use\u2019 \u201d was to grind brakeshoe linings in order to fit them properly on brakedrums. At all \u201crelevant\u201d times, the brakeshoe linings that Hennessy\u2019s machine was designed to grind \u201ccontained asbestos.\u201d The asbestos in these brake linings was \u201cphysically bound,\u201d but became airborne and harmful when the linings were subjected to the grinding action of Hennessy\u2019s machine. Hennessy knew or should have known that the intended use of its machine would result in the harmful release of airborne asbestos fibers, yet it failed to take reasonable measures to protect those using the machine or in proximity during its use. The machine was defective because it did not include reasonable, protective design features such as a dust collection system or a grinding mechanism exerting sufficient revolution velocity, temperature and pressure, so as to convert any asbestos fibers into nonharmful forsterite. Hennessy\u2019s defective grinding machine was marketed to users, and its sole use for grinding asbestos-containing brake linings caused the release of airborne asbestos fibers otherwise contained harmlessly within the linings, resulting in inhalation of asbestos fibers by plaintiffs (or plaintiffs\u2019 decedent) and consequent injury to these persons. Hennessy\u2019s product was intended to be used with another product for the very activity that created a hazardous situation for the user. Its sole intended use was for an activity known to Hennessy to pose an unreasonable risk of harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>These allegations distinguish Hennessy from the defendants in <em>Taylor </em>and <em>O\u2019Neil </em>because the products manufactured by the defendants in those cases were not shown to have caused, created or contributed substantially to the harm of airborne asbestos fibers to which the injured persons in those cases were exposed. (See <em>O\u2019Neil, supra, </em>53 Cal.4th at p. 342; <em>Taylor, supra, </em>171 Cal.App.4th at p. 580.) The causes of action against Hennessy, accepted as true, allege that it manufactured and distributed a machine that did indeed create or contribute substantially to the exposure to airborne asbestos fibers suffered by plaintiffs or plaintiffs\u2019 decedent. Nor is liability under these causes of action precluded under either the \u201cchain of distribution\u201d or the \u201ccomponent parts\u201d doctrines applied in <em>O\u2019Neil </em>and <em>Taylor. </em>Taken as true, the causes of action contend that Hennessy distributed a machine directly to consumers designed only to grind asbestos-containing brake linings, a machine that was defective because its intended operation necessarily released asbestos fibers into the air and was not a machine manufactured for use as a component in another finished product. Unlike defendant\u2019s cigarette lighter analogy,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the alleged sole and intended use of the brake arcing machine resulted in the release of contained asbestos particles. These allegations satisfy the circumscribed parameters of liability articulated by the Court of Appeal in <em>Tellez-Cordova </em>and approved by the Supreme Court in <em>O\u2019Neil.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">In addition, the imposition of strict liability would not require Hennessy to anticipate or incorporate safety measures into its machine that might be unnecessary for its intended uses, since the machine had only one intended function. <em>(Taylor, supra, </em>171 Cal.App.4th at pp. 582-583.)</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">As summarized by the Supreme Court, \u201ca product manufacturer may not be held liable in strict liability or negligence for harm caused by another manufacturer\u2019s product <em>unless the defendant\u2019s own product contributed substantially to the harm, or the defendant participated substantially in creating a harmful combined use of the products.\u201d (O\u2019Neil, supra, </em>53 Cal.4th at p. 342, italics added.) We conclude, at this pleading stage, plaintiffs\u2019 allegations in their \u201cBrake Shoe Grinding Machine\u201d causes of action fall within the exception in <em>O\u2019Neil </em>sufficiently to withstand a motion for judgment on the pleadings and allow these cases to go forward on strict liability and liability for negligence.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b729-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">Each of the judgments in these consolidated cases is reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">Dondero, J., and Banke, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">On May 3, 2012, the opinion was modified to read as printed above.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b714-10\"> In one of the consolidated appeals, plaintiffs are the heirs and successors of decedent Ted Kennedy, who allegedly worked as an automobile mechanic, suffered exposure to asbestos, and died about a year and a half after being diagnosed with asbestosis and asbestos-related pleural disease in April 2008.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b715-14\"> We note there are 21 separate appeals pending before this court, all involving plaintiffs who pleaded similar causes of action based on the law firm\u2019s Master Complaint, and who appealed following the trial court\u2019s grant of a motion for judgment on the pleadings.
