INTRODUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b52-10\">Defendant and appellant Michael Lee Bejasa was involved in an automobile collision that seriously injured his passenger. The first police officer at the scene searched defendant and found two syringes, one of which contained methamphetamine. Defendant admitted that the syringes were used to inject methamphetamine and that he was on parole. The police officer handcuffed defendant, told him he was being detained for a possible parole violation, and placed him in the back of his police car. The officer did not give defendant the Miranda<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> warnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>Upon the arrival of additional officers a short time later, defendant was released from the police car and his handcuffs were removed. The investigating officer conducted an interview and various field sobriety tests (FST) and determined that defendant was possibly under the influence of drugs. The officer then advised defendant he was under arrest. Defendant was not given his <em>Miranda </em>rights until he was taken to the police station.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">Defendant was charged and convicted by a jury of driving a vehicle under the influence of a drug and personally causing great bodily injury to another (count l),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> as well as transporting a controlled substance (count 2).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Defendant also pled guilty to driving without a license (count 3).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Following a bifurcated court trial, the court found true allegations of prior convictions and two prior strike convictions.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The trial court sentenced defendant to consecutive 25-year-to-life sentences on counts 1 and 2. On count 3, defendant received a term of 180 days, to run concurrent to count 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">On appeal, defendant argues the trial court erred in refusing to suppress evidence of statements made to the police after defendant was handcuffed and placed in a police car prior to being advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. Among other statements that should have been suppressed, defendant claims that his estimation of time, made during a \u201cRomberg,\u201d or modified attention, FST (Romberg test), was testimonial evidence and should have been excluded under <em>Miranda. </em>In the published portion of our opinion, we conclude the trial court erred in admitting defendant\u2019s custodial statements to the police, including the estimation of time made during the Romberg test. However, because we further conclude the error was harmless, we affirm defendant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">The remaining issues concern the trial court\u2019s sentencing of defendant. Defendant contends the court failed to realize that the \u201cThree Strikes\u201d law does not require consecutive sentencing if the crimes were committed on the same occasion, and the imposition of a consecutive sentence on count 2 was an abuse of discretion. Defendant also argues the court should have stayed the sentence on count 2 pursuant to Penal Code section 654 because the two crimes were committed with a single intent and objective. We address these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>issues in the nonpublished portion of our opinion. We agree with defendant that the court was unaware of its discretion in determining whether to impose a consecutive or concurrent sentence on count 2, and failed to exercise such discretion. A new sentencing hearing is therefore required, at which the court shall exercise such discretion. Finally, we agree with defendant that the sentence on count 2 must be stayed pursuant to Penal Code section 654.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">A. <em>Motion to Suppress Defendant\u2019s Statements Made Prior to </em>Miranda <em>Warnings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">1. <em>Factual and Procedural Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">Prior to trial, defendant moved to suppress statements made to police officers after he was handcuffed and placed in the police car and prior to being advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. The motion was based on the evidence presented at defendant\u2019s preliminary hearing. The following is our summary of that evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-8\">On the evening of September 19, 2008, defendant was driving a Jeep northbound on State Street in Hemet. Defendant\u2019s girlfriend, Stasha Lewellyn, was riding in the passenger seat. At approximately 6:52 p.m., Terri Patterson observed the Jeep as she drove in the southbound slow lane. The oncoming Jeep changed lanes and veered all the way across the street into Patterson\u2019s lane. Patterson was unable to avoid the Jeep, and the vehicles collided head on. Lewellyn, who was not wearing a seatbelt, was thrown from the Jeep. As a result, she sustained major injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-9\">Hemet Police Officer Derek Maddox was the first police officer to arrive at the scene of the crash. After making sure that the injured parties were being treated by paramedics, Officer Maddox contacted defendant and asked him what happened. Defendant said he had been driving and Lewellyn had been thrown from the Jeep because she was not wearing a seatbelt. Officer Maddox noticed that defendant\u2019s eyes were bloodshot. He told defendant to sit on the curb.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-10\">Traffic officers were called to continue the investigation. Officer Maddox waited until other officers arrived, then resumed questioning defendant. During this exchange, defendant admitted he was on parole. Defendant consented to a search, during which Officer Maddox found two syringes. One <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>syringe was empty; the other contained a small amount of liquid that was later determined to be methamphetamine. Defendant admitted he used the syringe to \u201cshoot up methamphetamine.\u201d By the time of the search, less than 20 minutes had passed since Officer Maddox arrived on the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">Officer Maddox handcuffed defendant and placed him in the back of his police car to await officers from the traffic department. As defendant was being handcuffed, Officer Maddox informed him that \u201che was being detained for a possible parole violation.\u201d Officer Maddox did not give defendant the <em>Miranda </em>warnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">Officer Tony Spates, a Hemet traffic officer, arrived at the scene of the crash at approximately 7:15 p.m. Four other traffic officers responded as well. When Officer Spates arrived, Officer Maddox and another officer briefed him on the collision. Officer Spates then allowed defendant to get out of the police car and removed defendant\u2019s handcuffs. Officer Spates proceeded to interview defendant, using a form provided by the Hemet Police Department, in order to determine whether defendant had been driving under the influence. These questions included: \u201cWhat have you been drinking?,\u201d \u201cHow much?,\u201d \u201cWhen did you start?,\u201d \u201cWhen did you stop?,\u201d \u201cDo you feel the effects of the alcohol?,\u201d and \u201cDo you think that you should be driving?\u201d In response to Officer Spates\u2019s questions, defendant made incriminating statements regarding his use of drugs.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">Officer Spates also administered a number of FST\u2019s on defendant, with mixed results. While defendant was able to perform some of the tests to Officer Spates\u2019s satisfaction, other test results suggested that defendant was under the influence of a narcotic.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-8\">The first FST administered by Officer Spates was the Romberg test. Defendant was asked to stand at attention, close his eyes, tilt his head back, and estimate the passage of 30 seconds. While defendant performed the test, Officer Spates observed defendant\u2019s balance and his ability to accurately measure the passage of 30 seconds. Officer Spates testified that defendant leaned slightly and finished counting at 25 seconds. Officer Spates testified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>that the result was consistent with the use of a stimulant because it showed that defendant was \u201cmoving a little fast.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">At the conclusion of the FST\u2019s, Officer Spates advised defendant he was under arrest. Defendant\u2019s blood subsequently tested positive for methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">2. <em>The Hearing on the Motion to Suppress</em></p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">At the hearing on defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, defendant argued he had been placed in custody and his statements made to Officer Spates were inadmissible because he had received no <em>Miranda </em>warnings. Furthermore, defendant claimed the FST\u2019s were also inadmissible testimonial evidence for the same reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">The trial court rejected defendant\u2019s argument and ruled that, in light of the totality of the circumstances, defendant was not in custody. The court found that Officer Maddox was conducting a preliminary investigation and that he had, at most, only one other officer with him. The court reasoned that Officer Maddox detained defendant briefly, until an investigating officer arrived, in order to effectively manage the accident scene. Once Officer Spates arrived, defendant was released and \u201cessentially free to move around.\u201d The statements made to Officer Spates were thus not the result of custodial interrogation. The trial court also denied the motion to suppress the FST results based on the conclusions that defendant was not in custody at the time the FST\u2019s were administered and defendant\u2019s performance on the FST\u2019s were \u201cnon-testimonial.\u201d Therefore, the statements and FST results were ruled admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-8\">On appeal, defendant challenges the admissibility of the incriminating statements made to Officer Spates and the estimation of time during the Romberg test.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-9\">3. <em>Miranda</em></p>\n<p id=\"b56-10\">In <em>Miranda, </em>the United States Supreme Court held that the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination prevents the prosecution from using \u201cstatements, whether exculpatory or inculpatory, stemming from custodial interrogation of the defendant unless it demonstrates the use of procedural safeguards effective to secure the privilege against self-incrimination.\u201d <em>(Miranda, supra, </em>384 U.S. at p. 444.) The court was concerned that, without these procedural safeguards, the \u201cinherently compelling pressures\u201d of custodial interrogation might induce suspects to speak where they normally would not. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 467.)</p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>These procedural safeguards require that a person in custody \u201cfirst be informed in clear and unequivocal terms that he has the right to remain silent\u201d and \u201cthat anything said can and will be used against the individual in court.\u201d <em>(Miranda, supra, </em>384 U.S. at pp. 467-469.) Furthermore, a person in custody must be advised of his or her \u201cright to consult with a lawyer and to have the lawyer with him during interrogation.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 471.) Finally, the person must be told that \u201cif he is indigent a lawyer will be appointed to represent him.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 473.) If these advisements are not made, \u201cno evidence obtained as a result of interrogation can be used against him.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 479, fii. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">In reviewing a trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion to suppress evidence based upon a <em>Miranda </em>violation, \u201c \u2018we accept the trial court\u2019s resolution of disputed facts and inferences, and its evaluations of credibility, if supported by substantial evidence. We independently determine from the undisputed facts and the facts properly found by the trial court whether the challenged statement was illegally obtained.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gamache </em>(2010) 48 Cal.4th 347, 385 [106 Cal.Rptr.3d 771, 227 P.3d 342].)</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">4. <em>Custody</em></p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\"><em>Miranda </em>advisements are only required when a person is subjected to custodial interrogation. <em>(Miranda, supra, </em>384 U.S. at p. 444.) A suspect is in custody when a reasonable person in the suspect\u2019s position would feel that his \u201cfreedom of action is curtailed to a \u2018degree associated with formal arrest.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Berkemer </em>v. <em>McCarty </em>(1984) 468 U.S. 420, 440, 442 [82 L.Ed.2d 317, 104 S.Ct. 3138] <em>(Berkemer).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b57-8\">Because a <em>Miranda </em>warning is only required once custodial interrogation begins, the defendant must necessarily have been in custody in order to assert a violation. \u201cIn determining whether an individual was in custody, a court must examine all of the circumstances surrounding the interrogation . . . .\u201d <em>(Stansbury </em>v. <em>California </em>(1994) 511 U.S. 318, 322 [128 L.Ed.2d 293, 114 S.Ct. 1526].) These circumstances must be measured \u201cagainst an objective, legal standard: would a reasonable person in the suspect\u2019s position during the interrogation experience a restraint on his or her freedom of movement to the degree normally associated with a formal arrest.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Aguilera </em>(1996) 51 Cal.App.4th 1151, 1161 [59 Cal.Rptr.2d 587]; see <em>Berkemer, supra, </em>468 U.S. at p. 442; <em>California v. Beheler </em>(1983) 463 U.S. 1121, 1125 [77 L.Ed.2d 1275, 103 S.Ct. 3517]; <em>People v. Stansbury </em>(1995) 9 Cal.4th 824, 830 [38 Cal.Rptr.2d 394, 889 P.2d 588].)</p>\n<p id=\"b57-9\">California courts have identified a number of factors relevant to this determination. While no one factor is conclusive, relevant factors include: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>\u201c \u2018(1) [W]hether the suspect has been formally arrested; (2) absent formal arrest, the length of the detention; (3) the location; (4) the ratio of officers to suspects; and (5) the demeanor of the officer, including the nature of the questioning.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Pilster </em>(2006) 138 Cal.App.4th 1395, 1403 [42 Cal.Rptr.3d 301]; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Forster </em>(1994) 29 Cal.App.4th 1746, 1753 [35 Cal.Rptr.2d 705]; <em>People v. Lopez </em>(1985) 163 Cal.App.3d 602, 608 [209 Cal.Rptr. 575.)</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">Additional factors include: \u201c[W]hether the suspect agreed to the interview and was informed he or she could terminate the questioning, whether police informed the person he or she was considered a witness or suspect, whether there were restrictions on the suspect\u2019s freedom of movement during the interview, and whether police officers dominated and controlled the interrogation or were \u2018aggressive, confrontational, and/or accusatory,\u2019 whether they pressured the suspect, and whether the suspect was arrested at the conclusion of the interview.\u201d <em>(People v. Pilster, supra, </em>138 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1403-1404, citing <em>People </em>v. <em>Aguilera, supra, </em>51 Cal.App.4th at p. 1162.)</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">In denying the defense\u2019s motion for suppression of evidence, the trial court concluded that, under the totality of the circumstances, defendant was not placed in custody when he was initially restrained. The trial court characterized the seizure as a \u201cbrief detention.\u201d The trial court supported this ruling with facts from the record that weigh against an objective determination of custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">For example, the trial court found that defendant was restrained for only a brief period of time. The record provides ample evidence supporting this conclusion. Officer Maddox responded to the collision at approximately 6:52 p.m. Officer Spates arrived at approximately 7:15 p.m. During this time, Officer Maddox checked for injured parties, then proceeded to question and search defendant before handcuffing him and placing him in the police car. Because of this small window of time, defendant was likely restrained only for a matter of minutes. The brief nature of this restraint tends to show that defendant was merely detained, not in custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">The trial court also found that, when defendant was restrained, Officer Maddox was accompanied by no more than one other officer. Logically, the fewer the number of officers surrounding a suspect the less likely the suspect will be affected by custodial pressures. However, while this factor would normally weigh against a finding of custody, the argument is less persuasive under the present facts. Here, defendant was restrained when police were shorthanded. However, questioning resumed after more officers arrived.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>Another factor identified by the trial court is the fact that Officer Maddox was in \u201cpreliminary investigative stages\u201d when he restrained defendant. This also tends to support the determination that defendant was not in custody. Because Officer Maddox was concerned with gathering information regarding what had occurred, rather than questioning defendant as a suspect, it is less likely defendant was exposed to custodial pressures.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">While the above facts offer some support for the trial court\u2019s determination that defendant was not in custody, other circumstances lend great weight to the argument that a reasonable person would have felt restrained in a manner normally associated with formal arrest. First, prior to being restrained, defendant had incriminated himself in a number of ways. While talking to Officer Maddox, defendant admitted he was on parole. Defendant then consented to a search of his person. That search yielded two syringes, one of which contained a liquid. Defendant further admitted that the syringes were used to \u201cshoot up methamphetamine.\u201d At that point, Officer Maddox restrained defendant and informed him that he was being \u201cdetained for a possible parole violation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">The fact that defendant offered several incriminating facts and was restrained so quickly thereafter weighs strongly in favor of a finding of custody. A reasonable person in defendant\u2019s position would know that possession of methamphetamine and related paraphernalia is a parole violation and a crime, and that arrest would likely follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">Second, the fact that Officer Maddox advised defendant he was being \u201cdetained for a possible parole violation\u201d also weighs in favor of custody. The word \u201cdetained,\u201d by itself, cannot abrogate the likelihood of custodial pressures. A reasonable person would probably not be comforted by the fact that the officer used the word \u201cdetained\u201d and mentioned only a \u201cpossible\u201d crime. Here, defendant had just admitted that he was on parole and had been using and carrying methamphetamine. In this context, a reasonable person would understand the officer\u2019s statement to mean that he or she was not free to leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-8\">Even if the above circumstances are insufficient to constitute a level of restraint comparable to formal arrest, the physical restraint that followed crosses that boundary. Defendant was confronted with two of the most unmistakable indicia of arrest: he was handcuffed and placed in the back of a police car. A reasonable person, under these circumstances, would feel restrained to a \u201c \u2018degree associated with formal arrest.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Berkemer, supra, </em>468 U.S. at p. 440.)</p>\n<p id=\"b60-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>In their respondent\u2019s brief, the People cite language from <em>Berkemer </em>pertaining to \u201cordinary traffic stops.\u201d (See <em>Berkemer, supra, </em>468 U.S. at p. 440.) As the People note, the <em>Berkemer </em>opinion states that the \u201ccircumstances associated with the typical traffic stop are not such that the motorist feels completely at the mercy of the police.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 438.) The United States Supreme Court concluded that \u201cpersons temporarily detained pursuant to such [ordinary traffic] stops are not \u2018in custody\u2019 for the purposes of Miranda.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 440.)</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">This was not a typical traffic stop. Defendant was handcuffed and placed in the back of a police car before Officer Spates arrived. A reasonable person in that situation would feel completely at the mercy of the police. As <em>Berkemer </em>stated, such a person is \u201centitled to the full panoply of protections prescribed by Miranda.\u201d <em>(Berkemer, supra, </em>468 U.S. at p. 440.)</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">The People also contend it was reasonable for Officer Maddox to place defendant in the back of the police car until other officers arrived. We do not disagree with this point. As the first officer on the scene, Officer Maddox was likely met with chaos. Officer Maddox testified that there were \u201cnumerous officers directing traffic\u201d and that police \u201chad to shut down the entire roadway for the helicopter.\u201d By restraining defendant and waiting for backup, we have no doubt that Officer Maddox acted prudently.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">However, this argument is misdirected. \u201cWhether an individual has been unreasonably seized for Fourth Amendment purposes and whether that individual is in custody for <em>Miranda </em>purposes are two different issues. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v. Pilster, supra, </em>138 Cal.App.4th at p. 1405.) Here, the issue is not whether the police acted reasonably in detaining or restraining defendant, but rather \u201c \u2018whether there [was] a \u201cformal arrest or restraint on freedom of movement\u201d of the degree associated with a formal arrest.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Stansbury v. California, supra, </em>511 U.S. at p. 322.)</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">While a reviewing court must apply a deferential substantial evidence standard to the trial court\u2019s factual findings, it must independently determine whether the defendant was in custody. <em>(People v. Ochoa </em>(1998) 19 Cal.4th 353, 402 [79 Cal.Rptr.2d 408, 966 P.2d 442]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Pilster, supra, </em>138 Cal.App.4th at p. 1403.) Based on the totality of the circumstances, we hold that defendant was placed in custody when he was handcuffed and placed in the police car.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-8\">Furthermore, although defendant was released from the police car and the handcuffs removed by the time Officer Spates questioned him, defendant remained in custody for purposes of <em>Miranda. </em>The removal of the restraints was not enough to ameliorate the custodial pressures that likely remained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>from the initial confinement. Furthermore, defendant was released from the police car only after numerous officers had arrived at the scene. The ratio of officers to suspect had increased to at least seven to one, thus increasing the custodial pressure on defendant.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">5. <em>Interrogation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">Interrogation is express questioning or \u201cany words or actions on the part of the police (other than those normally attendant to arrest and custody) that the police should know are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from the suspect.\u201d <em>(Rhode Island v. Innis </em>(1980) 446 U.S. 291, 301 [64 L.Ed.2d 297, 100 S.Ct. 1682], fns. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">After releasing defendant from his handcuffs, Officer Spates proceeded to question defendant. The People argue that these questions were of a sufficiently general nature to escape the requirement of a <em>Miranda </em>warning. Relying on <em>People v. Milham </em>(1984) 159 Cal.App.3d 487 [205 Cal.Rptr. 688] <em>(Milham), </em>the People assert that general questions regarding the facts of a crime may be asked of \u201cpersons temporarily detained by officers who do not have probable cause to arrest.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 500.) These questions are \u201cdesigned to . . . enable the police to quickly ascertain whether such person should be permitted to go about his business or held to answer charges.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b61-8\">While this principle is sound, it is inapplicable to the facts of this case. For instance, defendant was restrained after Officer Maddox suspected a parole violation. It is likely that Officer Maddox had probable cause to arrest defendant at that point. However, by restraining defendant for further investigation, it is evident that Officer Maddox had decided not to allow defendant \u201cto go about his business.\u201d <em>(Milham, supra, </em>159 Cal.App.3d at p. 500.) Furthermore, the questions asked by Officer Spates were not \u201c[g]eneral on-the-scene\u201d questions. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The questions were such that the police should reasonably have known they were \u201clikely to elicit an incriminating response.\u201d <em>(Rhode Island v. Innis, supra, </em>446 U.S. at p. 301, fn. omitted.) The facts of <em>Milham </em>clearly illustrate this distinction.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-9\">In <em>Milham, </em>the defendant was involved in a car accident that resulted in the death of two of his passengers. <em>(Milham, supra, </em>159 Cal.App.3d 487.) At the scene of the crash, a responding officer approached the defendant and asked whether he was involved in the accident. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 499.) The defendant stated that he had been driving the car and that he was worried he had killed his wife. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The officer then asked how the accident had happened. <em>(Ibid.) </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>The defendant answered that he thought he had \u201c \u2018blacked out.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>He was later convicted of driving under the influence. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 487.)</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">The defendant appealed his conviction, arguing that the statements made to the officer should have been excluded because no <em>Miranda </em>warnings had been given. <em>(Milham, supra, </em>159 Cal.App.3d at p. 499.) The court rejected this argument, explaining that the \u201c[gjeneral on-the-scene questioning\u201d present in the facts did not present a <em>Miranda </em>violation. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 500.) The court noted that the responding officer had no indication that a crime had been committed. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The court also reasoned that, although the officer asked the defendant questions, the officer\u2019s \u201csuspicion of criminality\u201d had not yet focused on the defendant. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 500-501.) Finally, the defendant in <em>Milham </em>was not in police custody at the time of the questioning. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 500.)</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">Each of the above factors presents a separate point of distinction. First, Officer Spates was briefed by Officer Maddox before he began to question defendant. He knew that defendant was on parole and had been in possession of methamphetamine and syringes. It cannot be said, therefore, that Officer Spates lacked an indication that a crime had been committed. Similarly, it cannot be reasonably argued that defendant was not under suspicion of criminality. Finally, when the questioning began, defendant was already in police custody because of a \u201cpossible parole violation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">As the court noted in <em>Milham, </em>the \u201cshift from investigatory to accusatory questioning can be very subtle . . . .\u201d <em>(Milham, supra, </em>159 Cal.App.3d at p. 500.) However, this case provides no such subtlety. Here, defendant was asked questions such as, \u201c[wjhat have you been drinking?\u201d and \u201c[hjow much?\u201d These questions contrast strongly against general questions such as, \u201c \u2018[wjere you involved in the accident?\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 494.)</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">Unlike the questions in <em>Milham, </em>the questions posed to defendant were such that the police should have known they would likely elicit an incriminating response. Here, the police knew defendant had violated his parole and was carrying methamphetamine. The questions posed to defendant by Officer Spates reflected that knowledge. By the time he contacted defendant, Officer Spates had moved past investigation and into the realm of inculpation. Therefore, defendant was interrogated by Officer Spates.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-8\">Because defendant was interrogated while in custody, the police were obligated to apprise defendant of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. Since defendant was not given his <em>Miranda </em>advisements until after Officer Spates\u2019s interrogation, evidence of his responses to the interrogation cannot be used against him. <em>(Miranda, supra, </em>384 U.S. at p. 479.) Accordingly, the trial court erred in denying defendant\u2019s motion to suppress such evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>6. <em>Admission of Romberg Test</em></p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">At the hearing on the motion to suppress, defendant challenged the admissibility of evidence that he estimated the passage of 30 seconds under the Romberg test when only 25 seconds had passed. The trial court denied the motion to suppress the FST results based on its conclusion that defendant was not in custody at the time the FST\u2019s were administered. The court further ruled that the FST\u2019s were \u201cnon-testimonial\u201d in nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">On appeal, defendant argues he was in custody at the time the FST\u2019s were administered and that the estimation of time was testimonial because he was asked to \u201ccommunicate the result of his mental process.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Defendant argues, therefore, that the evidence was inadmissible because there had been no <em>Miranda </em>warnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">Because we previously determined that defendant was in custody for the purposes of <em>Miranda </em>and that Officer Spates\u2019s questions constituted interrogation, the remaining issue is whether the estimation of time made during the Romberg test is testimonial evidence for purposes of <em>Miranda.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">The Fifth Amendment provides that no \u201cperson . . . shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself. . . .\u201d (U.S. Const., 5th Amend.) The United States Supreme Court has held that this privilege \u201cdoes not protect a suspect from being compelled by the State to produce \u2018real or physical evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Muniz, supra, </em>496 U.S. at p. 589, quoting <em>Schmerber v. California, supra, </em>384 U.S. at p. 764.) The privilege \u201cprotects an accused only from being compelled to testify against himself, or otherwise provide the State with evidence of a testimonial or communicative nature.\u201d <em>(Schmerber v. California, supra, </em>at p. 761, fn. omitted.) \u201c[I]n order to be testimonial, an accused\u2019s communication must itself, explicitly or implicitly, relate a factual assertion or disclose information. Only then is a person compelled to be a \u2018witness\u2019 against himself.\u201d <em>(Doe </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1988) 487 U.S. 201, 210 [101 L.Ed.2d 184, 108 S.Ct. 2341], fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b63-9\">Here, defendant contends the estimation of time made during the Romberg test was a communication that divulged his mental process in an incriminating manner, and is therefore testimonial evidence. To support this proposition, defendant relies on <em>Muniz.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b64-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>In <em>Muniz, </em>the defendant was pulled over by police and asked to perform various FST\u2019s. <em>(Muniz, supra, </em>496 U.S. at p. 585.) After performing poorly, the defendant admitted he had been drinking. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The police later asked the defendant to state \u201chis name, address, height, weight, eye color, date of birth, and current age.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 586.) Finally, the police asked the defendant for the date of his sixth birthday, which the defendant could not answer. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The defendant had not been given <em>Miranda </em>warnings. <em>(Muniz, supra, </em>at p. 586.)</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">The Supreme Court held that any physical observations made by police were nontestimonial and, therefore, were not gathered in violation of <em>Miranda. (Muniz, supra, </em>496 U.S. at p. 583.) For example, in reference to the defendant\u2019s slurred speech, the court held that \u201c[Requiring a suspect to reveal the physical manner in which he articulates words, like requiring him to reveal the physical properties of the sound produced by his voice, [citation] does not, without more, compel him to provide a \u2018testimonial\u2019 response for purposes of the privilege.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 592.) Additionally, \u201c \u2018routine booking question^],\u2019 \u201d such as the defendant\u2019s height, weight, eye color, etc., fall outside of <em>Miranda </em>protections. <em>(Muniz, supra, </em>at p. 601.)</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">The Supreme Court held, however, that the question regarding the defendant\u2019s sixth birthday called for a testimonial response because the question required the defendant to \u201ccommunicate an express or implied assertion of fact or belief.\u201d <em>(Muniz, supra, </em>496 U.S. at pp. 597-599, fn. omitted.) In such circumstances, \u201cthe suspect confronts the \u2018trilemma\u2019 of truth, falsity, or silence . . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 597.)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Because the defendant was in custody and had not been advised of his right to silence, the defendant\u2019s only choices were to incriminate himself by admitting that he did not know the date of his sixth birthday or to answer falsely and possibly incriminate himself with an incorrect guess. (496 U.S. at pp. 598-599.) \u201c[H]ence the response . . . contained] a testimonial component.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 597.)</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">The court held that the defendant\u2019s inability to answer the question \u201csupported an inference that his mental faculties were impaired, because his assertion (he did not know the date of his sixth birthday) was different from the assertion (he knew the date was [correct date]) that the trier of fact might reasonably have expected a lucid person to provide.\u201d <em>(Muniz, supra, </em>496 U.S. at p. 599.) Therefore, \u201cthe incriminating inference of impaired mental faculties stemmed, not just from the fact that Muniz slurred his response, but also from a testimonial aspect of that response.\u201d (Ibid., fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b65-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>Defendant claims that the Romberg test is \u201cmaterially indistinguishable\u201d from the sixth birthday question in <em>Muniz </em>because defendant, like the defendant in Muniz, was \u201casked to make a calculation, and communicate the result of his mental process.\u201d The People, in response, argue that the estimation of time was \u201canalogous to the slurred speech in <em>Muniz.\u201d </em>The determination of the issue, therefore, depends on whether the Romberg test required a testimonial response or produced only real or physical evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">As suggested by the People, the Romberg test results are similar, in some respects, to the physical evidence observed by officers during FST\u2019s. The Romberg test is designed to \u201cevaluate!] an individual\u2019s internal clock.\u201d <em>(Ramirez </em>v. <em>City of Buena Park </em>(9th Cir. 2009) 560 F.3d 1012, 1018.) An individual\u2019s internal clock is undoubtedly affected, at least in part, by his or her physical condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">However, the Romberg results are also unlike other purely physical observations, such as loss of balance, redness in the cheeks, or slurred speech. This point is illustrated by the relative complexity of the Romberg test. For example, evidence of slurred speech reflects only an officer\u2019s observation of the physical manifestation of the subject\u2019s intoxication (i.e., a lack of muscular coordination). Although the subject must speak in order for the observation to be made, the evidentiary value of the observation rests in how the communication was made, not its content.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">The Romberg test, on the other hand, implicitly requires the subject to count each passing second, or otherwise estimate the passage of time. Once the subject has counted 30 seconds, the subject must then notify the officer that his estimation is complete. Thus, unlike the slurring of speech observed in <em>Muniz, </em>the Romberg test requires the subject to make a mental calculation and communicate that calculation to police.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">The probative value of the Romberg test, therefore, lies firmly in the accuracy of the subject\u2019s estimation as communicated to police. Because the test requires the suspect to communicate an implied assertion of fact or belief (i.e., that 30 seconds has elapsed), the test is similar to the sixth birthday question in <em>Muniz, </em>which called for a testimonial response. <em>(Muniz, supra, </em>496 U.S. at p. 597.) Because he was not told of his right to remain silent, defendant was faced with the choice of stating an incriminating truth (i.e., that he believed 30 seconds had elapsed when that amount of time had not in fact passed) or a falsity (i.e., making a guess as to when 30 seconds had passed).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-9\">The communication of a mental calculation also distinguishes the use of the Romberg test from FST\u2019s that merely call for the suspect to count or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>recite the alphabet. In <em>Muniz, </em>for example, the defendant was asked to count while performing walking and balancing FST\u2019s. The defendant counted accurately in one test and did not count at all in the other. <em>(Muniz, supra, </em>496 U.S. at p. 603, fn. 17.) Because the defendant did not argue that his failure to count was incriminating, the court refused to rule on \u201cwhether Muniz\u2019s counting-(or not counting) itself was \u2018testimonial\u2019 within the meaning of the privilege.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">Although the United States Supreme Court and California courts have not addressed the testimonial nature of FST\u2019s involving counting, the majority of state courts that have addressed the issue hold that counting (as well as reciting the alphabet) is nontestimonial.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In most of these cases, the courts have reasoned that counting or reciting the alphabet does not reveal a person\u2019s personal beliefs or knowledge. <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">However, even assuming, arguendo, that counting is nontestimonial, the inquiry concerning the Romberg test must continue. While the ability to count may reasonably be viewed as indicative of a reflexive or physical process, it is evident that the Romberg test requires a calculation that goes beyond the simple recitation of a memorized sequence. In contrast to reflexive counting, the Romberg test requires the subject to measure the passage of time, and then make an assertion that 30 seconds has passed. It is this assertion that determines the testimonial nature of the Romberg test response. Therefore, we need not decide if counting is testimonial for <em>Miranda </em>purposes. The subject of a Romberg test must not only count, but also count at a speed that accurately measures the passage of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">Here, as in <em>Muniz, </em>the suspect was required to make a calculation and communicate the results of that calculation to the police. That communication was an assertion of fact or belief that was relevant for its accuracy, not for the manner in which it was delivered. Therefore, defendant\u2019s estimation of time was testimonial evidence. Because the test was administered while defendant was in custody and was reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response, <em>Miranda </em>warnings were required. Because no such warnings were given, defendant\u2019s estimation was inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>7. <em>Prejudice</em></p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">Although the court erred in failing to exclude the challenged statements, the error was not prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">Federal constitutional error is not prejudicial and does not require reversal where the reviewing court properly concludes it was \u201charmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>(Chapman v. California </em>(1967) 386 U.S. 18, 24 [17 L.Ed.2d 705, 87 S.Ct. 824].)</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">The first statement challenged on appeal is defendant\u2019s statement to Officer Spates that he had consumed alcohol. This statement was harmless because the focus of the trial was on defendant\u2019s possession and use of methamphetamine, not alcohol. Indeed, the jury heard defendant\u2019s preliminary alcohol screening returned a 0.00 percent reading. Furthermore, Officer Spates testified that he \u201cexcluded alcohol\u201d as a suspected intoxicant after performing the preliminary alcohol screening. It is clear from the record that defendant was convicted based on his consumption of methamphetamine. The fact that defendant said he consumed alcohol could not reasonably have affected the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">The second challenged statement was defendant\u2019s statement that he should not have been driving because he did not have a license. This statement was harmless as well. Defendant pled guilty to driving without a license and, at trial, his counsel stated that driving without a license \u201cwas never an issue.\u201d While it may be argued that the suspension or revocation of a license may suggest a past crime, here defendant was not asked why his license was revoked. Again, testimony focused on whether defendant was under the influence of methamphetamine. Therefore, this statement is unlikely to have influenced the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-9\">Defendant also challenges the admissibility of his declaration that \u201che had shot up some speed\u201d and that he had \u201cinjected it into his left wrist.\u201d These statements, although clearly relevant to the issue of defendant\u2019s intoxication, were harmless as well. At trial, a great body of evidence was presented establishing defendant\u2019s use of methamphetamine. For example, the jury heard that defendant was found to be in possession of methamphetamine and syringes. Defendant admitted to Officer Maddox that the syringes were used \u201c[f]or shooting up methamphetamine.\u201d The jury also heard Officer Spates\u2019s testimony regarding defendant\u2019s physical appearance (including the puncture wound on defendant\u2019s wrist) and his poor physical performance during sobriety tests. In addition, the jury heard that defendant\u2019s blood was found to contain 198 nanograms of methamphetamine\u2014an amount an expert testified \u201cis consistent with an abuse level.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b68-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>In contrast to the strong evidence of defendant\u2019s intoxication, the results of the Romberg test were not necessarily even incriminating. For example, a toxicologist testified with respect to the Romberg results: \u201cIt\u2019s not too far off from actual time. It\u2019s heading in a fast direction.\u201d In addition, Officer Spates admitted that if two people counted to 30, a five-second disparity could be explained by the simple fact that one person \u201ccounted a little faster.\u201d Although the Romberg evidence supports an inference that defendant was under the influence of a stimulant, it is clear that the inclusion of this evidence, even in conjunction with the other statements made to Officer Spates, was overshadowed by the properly admitted evidence supporting a finding of intoxication.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">Defendant argues, however, that because there was conflicting evidence presented at trial on the issue of impairment, it is likely that the statements were relatively influential. While it is clear that these statements are relevant to defendant\u2019s use of methamphetamine, when viewed in the context of the entire record, it is improbable they influenced the jury. The jury heard that defendant drove a vehicle into oncoming traffic. He was in possession of methamphetamine and drug paraphernalia. He exhibited various physical indications of intoxication. Methamphetamine was found in defendant\u2019s blood at levels indicating abuse. Finally, the jury heard expert testimony that a person \u201cwould [not] be able to safely operate a motor vehicle\u201d \u201cbased on the levels [of methamphetamine] detected in this case, the driving pattern . . . , as well as the eyelid flutter and the rebound dilation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">Under these facts, we hold that the erroneous admission of defendant\u2019s statements to police, and the results of the Romberg test, was \u201charmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>(Chapman v. California, supra, </em>386 U.S. at p. 24.)</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">B. <em>Sentencing </em>Issues<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">III. DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">Defendant\u2019s conviction is affirmed.
