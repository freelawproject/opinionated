Because we have held that application of the Maryland Rules of Evidence is not mandatory in permanency planning hearings, the Circuit Court did not commit error in admitting hearsay testimony from the social worker and the Court Appointed Special Advocates during the permanency planning proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">Facts and Procedural History<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">Ms. B., an Appellant in this case, has four children who are the subjects of the permanency planning hearing at issue: Mary S., born in 1991, Jessica W., born in 1992, Billy W., born in 1994, and George B., born in 2000. The father of Mary S., Jessica W., and Billy W. is deceased. George B.\u2019s father is Mr. B., another Appellant in this ease, to whom Ms. B. was married, but from whom she is now separated. All four children resided with both Mr. and Ms. B. prior to the separation. The family first came to the attention of the Baltimore County Department of Social Services (\u201cDSS\u201d) when Mary S., then eight years old, alleged that she had been sexually abused by Mr. B., who was later charged and convicted. DSS, during its investigation of the sexual abuse allegations, determined that Ms. B. was aware of Mr. B.\u2019s past history of sexual abuse and knew of Mr. B.\u2019s behavior with Mary S., but had failed to take appropriate action to protect the girl. All of the children, nevertheless, remained in Ms. B.\u2019s care after she and Mr. B. separated. During the next two years, while the children were in Ms. B.\u2019s care, there were four additional investigations by DSS of abuse and neglect, including allegations that Mary S. had sexually abused Billy W.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">On February 7, 2002, DSS removed all four children from Ms. B.\u2019s care, placed them under emergency shelter care, and subsequently filed a petition in the Circuit Court for Baltimore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>County requesting judicial approval of shelter care for the children. The court conducted a hearing and ordered DSS custody of the children and shelter care for them, pending an adjudicatory hearing.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thereafter, during the adjudicatory hearing, all four children were declared to be children in need of assistance (\u201cCINA\u201d)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and committed to the care and custody of DSS for placement in foster care. The court also ordered that Ms. B. be permitted two hours supervised visitation once per week with all four children and that Mr. B. would have one hour supervised visitation once per week with George B.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> At that time, the permanency plan<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> for the children was reunification solely with Ms. B.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>Initially, DSS placed Billy W. and George B. together in a foster home; however, both boys were removed due to allegations that Billy W. had sexually abused a younger child in the home. After a brief stay in another home, Billy W. was committed to St. Vincent\u2019s Center, a residential treatment center, from June 2002 until November 2003, when DSS transferred him to a therapeutic foster home. During that same time George B. was moved to another foster home where he has remained.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">Mary S. and Jessica W. were placed together in a foster home; after six weeks both were moved to a therapeutic foster home. In August 2002, Mary S. was admitted to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>Sheppard Pratt Hospital for suicidal behavior, where she was diagnosed with \u201caggressive disorder recurrent with psychosis\u201d and \u201cpossible dissociative disorder.\u201d Mary S. stayed at Sheppard Pratt for six weeks, was discharged and moved to transitional housing, and then to the Villa Maria Residential Treatment Center for six months, before returning to the original therapeutic foster home in May 2003. Jessica W. has remained in the original therapeutic foster home the entire time.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">The Circuit Court conducted periodic review hearings,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and on June 23, 2003, DSS recommended, and the court ordered, a change in the permanency plan for George B. from reunification to a concurrent plan of reunification with Ms. B. and adoption. The court also increased Billy W., Jessica W., and Mary S.\u2019s visitation with Ms. B. to include, in addition to supervised visitation, one hour of unsupervised visitation. The reunification plan with Ms. B. for the three children remained unchanged. Mr. B.\u2019s visitation was changed to one hour supervised visitation per month with George B. Ms. B. did not object to the maintenance of the permanency plans for Billy W., Jessica W., or Mary S. Both parents contested the change in the permanency plan for George B., and noted separate appeals to the Court of Special Appeals, which affirmed the judgment of the Circuit Court in a consolidated unreported opinion. While that appeal was pending in the Court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>Special Appeals, the Circuit Court held another six month review hearing on November 10, 2003, in which the trial judge once again continued the commitment of all four children to the care and custody of DSS. The judge also ordered that Ms. B.\u2019s visitation with Billy W. and Jessica W. would remain two hours supervised per week and one hour unsupervised per week. As to Mary S., the parties agreed and the court acquiesced in the decision that Ms. B. would be permitted one hour supervised visitation per week, but that the unsupervised visitation would be suspended.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> With respect to George B., Ms. B.\u2019s visitation remained three hours, but the supervised visitation was reduced to one and a half hours per week. Mr. B.\u2019s visitation with George B., one hour supervised visitation per month, was not changed. Both Ms. B. and Mr. B. noted separate appeals from the court\u2019s order regarding George B., to the Court of Special Appeals, which in an unreported opinion, addressed the substantive issues raised by the parties and affirmed the judgment of the Circuit Court.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">Subsequently, while that appeal was pending in the Court of Special Appeals, the Circuit Court held a three-day review hearing on April 23, 2004 and May 4-5, 2004, which is the subject of this appeal. At the hearing, sixteen witnesses testified, including Ms. Kristy Caceres, a DSS social worker <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>assigned to the case, who testified about the progress of the children and the children\u2019s interaction with both Ms. B. and Mr. B. When DSS questioned Ms. Caceres about the progress of the children\u2019s family therapy, the following ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-5\">[DSS\u2019s COUNSEL]: And is that family therapy progressing as desired?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-6\">[MS. CACERES]: The last that I talked to the therapist, she seemed to think that there were some\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-7\">[Ms. B.\u2019s COUNSEL]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-8\">[THE COURT]: Basis?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-9\">[Ms. B.\u2019s COUNSEL]: Hearsay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-10\">[THE COURT]: It\u2019s a review hearing. I think there\u2019s some latitude.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-11\">[Ms. B.\u2019s COUNSEL]: Again, I\u2019m going to ask for a continuing objection to hearsay from therapists who aren\u2019t present- to testify and could have been.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-12\">[THE COURT]: All right. Overruled.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-13\">Ms. Caceres continued to testify that she spoke with the children\u2019s therapist, who was not present at the hearing, about the children\u2019s family therapy and that the therapist \u201cseemed to think that there was some progress. Things were going okay.\u201d Counsel for Ms. B. again objected on the grounds of hearsay, to which the hearing judge replied: \u201cIt\u2019s a review hearing. Strict rules of evidence don\u2019t apply if there\u2019s some foundation for the knowledge, but there\u2019s some latitude.\u201d After the judge overruled the hearsay objection, Ms. Caceres opined that the permanency plans for the children should not be changed because there had been \u201cminimal progress in Ms. B.\u2019s ability to focus on the kids and to provide for their individual needs.\u201d She also stated that DSS did not have the adoptive resources for the children and would not seek a termination of parental rights at that time. Ms. B. testified during the hearing that her relationship with the children was improving and that she would be able to care for the children if they were to be returned to her care.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-14\">Several social workers involved with supervising the visitation with George B. and Mr. B. also testified at the hearing. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>All of the social workers uniformly stated that during a visit between Mr. B. and George B. in February 2004, Mr. B.\u2019s behavior toward them was aggressive and erratic to a point that the police were called to remove Mr. B. from the building after he refused to leave the visiting room. The social workers also testified that during the altercation, Mr. B. became violent toward the police officers while George B. was present right outside the visiting room at the end of the visitation. Mr. B. testified during the hearing and denied that he had been loud and aggressive during the visit with George B., contrary to the testimony given by the social workers. Mr. B. explained that he only had expressed anger after George B. had been removed from the visitation room before the scheduled visitation time had lapsed. Mr B. further argued that he wanted George B.\u2019s permanency plan to be changed to a concurrent plan of reunification with both Mr. and Ms. B., and in the alternative, increased visitation would be acceptable.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">At the conclusion of the witness testimony, the trial judge referred the parties to the written reports of two Court Appointed Special Advocate (\u201cCASA\u201d) volunteers assigned to the cases, who were present during the hearing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-6\">[COURT]: Well, CASA is here. Usually at a review hearing I ask CASA if they have anything to add other than what\u2019s contained in the record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-7\">[MR. B.\u2019s COUNSEL]: But you accept the report in its entirety? I have not participated in one of these before.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-8\">[COURT]: The reports are filed as part of the Court file. If anyone has questions about them they can ask CASA. Or, if they want to inquire in any way, they can do that. Have you had a chance to review the CASA reports?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-9\">[MR. B.\u2019s COUNSEL]: Yes. And Your Honor, I was troubled by the hearsay in it, and how it was kind of replete with some false statements ... and that kind of thing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-10\">[DSS\u2019s COUNSEL]: I don\u2019t know how we address their report at this hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>[COURT]: Well, let\u2019s deal with the CASA reports in terms of what the objections or concerns are that you have about them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">After discussing the objections to the written reports, the judge explained that the parties could question the CASA volunteers about the reports and, then solicited testimony from both CASAs regarding the status of the children. Neither CASA volunteer was placed under oath prior to testifying at the1 hearing, and the CASA reports were not formally entered in evidence, although the record reflects that the reports previously had been reviewed by the juvenile court judge and the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">In response to questions from the hearing judge, the CASA volunteer assigned to the girls testified that Mary and Jessica had stated that they want unsupervised visitation with Ms. B., but that they did not want to return home to Ms. B. The judge inquired whether the parties had any questions for the CASA, to which each counsel replied in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">The CASA assigned to the boys, Billy W. and George B., was then called to testify, and in response to questions posed by the trial judge, the CASA volunteer stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-8\">[COURT]: Mr. [CASA], can I ask ... the frequency of your contact with the boys?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-9\">[CASA]: It varies. Sometimes it\u2019s once a month and sometimes it\u2019s twice a month. I talk to the stepmothers probably more than I see the boys, to find out how they are getting along. I do have a couple of things that I would like to say that are probably not in that report.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-10\">[COURT]: All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-11\">[CASA]: ... it\u2019s about the conversations that they had with their mother when they are on unsupervised visits, or when they are on visits. The mother\u2019s inappropriate conversation is a main problem that\u2019s causing these children a lot of stress and strain.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-12\">[MS. B.\u2019s COUNSEL]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-13\">[MR. B.\u2019s COUNSEL]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>[CASA]: This is my opinion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-5\">[COURT]: Hold on. Hold on. What\u2019s the basis of the objection?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-6\">[MR. B.\u2019S COUNSEL]: My basis was, he is expressing an opinion as to the main problem with these children. And again, that\u2019s inappropriate for him to say that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-7\">[COURT]: Mr. [CASA], you can tell me about whatever they have told you about conversations with\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-8\">[CASA]: I will do that. In ... January, I took ... Billy out for lunch.... He always have been extremely pleasant, courteous, very polite. This particular visit was very strenuous on me.... Billy was belligerent, he was aggressive, he was very sharp with me. He wouldn\u2019t answer questions when I talked to him. So, I took him home and told the ... foster mom, that it didn\u2019t go well. I called [the foster mom] up later that week and she said that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-9\">[MS. B.\u2019S COUNSEL]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-10\">[CASA]: I said that the visit went very bad. This is actually what happened.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-11\">[COURT]: What\u2019s the basis of the objection?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-12\">[MS. B.\u2019S COUNSEL]: We are getting hearsay from the foster mom on what she said Billy said to her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-13\">[COURT]: You know what, there is a statute that allows for CASA that permits precisely this. They are supposed to have contacts and report to the Court about the contacts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-14\">Hi Hi *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-15\">[CASA]: Anyhow, [the foster mom] told me that Billy said his mother said that I [the CASA] was a very bad person and that [Billy] should have no contact with me. He also said his ... foster mother was a very bad person, amongst other people. Now Billy knows better and he confides with me. On our ... last visit ... I confronted [Billy] with this question. We were going for a long ride, and [Billy] told me that his mom told him that I [the CASA] was a very bad person and that [Billy\u2019s] foster mother was also a bad <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>person, amongst other people in his school. And, that he was very mixed up and very confused.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-5\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-6\">[CASA]: And then I asked [Billy], you know, and Billy was telling me on this particular visit, and others, that on Wednesdays he sometimes gets very stressed out. And I asked him, why do you get stressed out on Wednesdays, and he said because he was to make plans for what he is going to do on Thursday with his mother. And I said, what do you mean, Billy, and he said you know, I have to set it all up, I\u2019ve got to make sure we do things right and go to the right places. I said, doesn\u2019t your mother handle that, and he said, no, she doesn\u2019t know the area and I have to handle it and I have to take care of it. This puts a lot of stress on this young man.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-7\">[COURT]: Okay.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">The same CASA volunteer assigned to the boys also testified about George B.\u2019s recent visits with Ms. B.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-9\">[CASA]: Georgie, is, by his foster-mom, he cries himself to sleep sometimes right after visits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-10\">[COURT]: Mr. [CASA], I\u2019ve got to limit you to things that you see, you observe, what you know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-11\">[CASA]: I\u2019ve got that. The visit that I had with Georgie, two or three weeks ago, on Saturday he and I had a very nice long walk and talk, and this is what he said to me. He told me his mother made him feel bad and she called him bad names. And also, my father is in jail. That was from Georgie\u2019s mouth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-12\">You know the foster parents have to pick up all the pieces of the visits, and it\u2019s getting tough on the foster parents.... That\u2019s the essence of what I have to say.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-13\">The trial judge then asked whether any of the parties had any questions to ask the CASA, to which the following dialogue ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>[MS. B.\u2019S COUNSEL]: I have one. In all the time that you have been involved in this case have you ever talked with Mrs. B.?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-5\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-6\">[CASA]: Well, I couldn\u2019t remember the dates. I have been involved with this two years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-7\">[MS. B.\u2019S COUNSEL]: It\u2019s been a while?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-8\">[CASA]: Probably.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-9\">[MS. B.\u2019S COUNSEL]: Have you ever tried to contact her? [CASA]: No. Should I?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-10\">[MS. B.\u2019S COUNSEL]: Have you ever tried to raise these concerns?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-11\">[COURT]: Wait a minute. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. I have volunteers here who are giving their time. This is not to be confrontational. Mr. [CASA], it\u2019s not the time to push them either. You can ask questions about the report, so do you have another question?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-12\">[MS. B.\u2019S COUNSEL]: No. No, I don\u2019t, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b451-13\">The judge then inquired a second time whether the parties had any further questions, to which each counsel replied in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-14\">At the conclusion of the hearing, the trial judge approved the extant permanency plans that all four children remain committed to the custody of DSS. With regard to visitation for Jessica W. and Mary S., the trial judge stated that \u201c[visitation [with Ms. B.] should be weekly, and it should be unsupervised.\u201d The judge also ordered Ms. B. to participate in family therapy with the girls. In expressing concern about the interaction between Billy W. and Ms. B., the judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A77\">With regard to Billy, the situation with Billy is more difficult because there are varying views of the appropriateness of comments that are made to him. My reaction to what I have heard on Billy is that he is still in a fairly fragile state. He has just come out of St. Vincent\u2019s, and he has had difficulty in adjusting.... On the one hand, there are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>suggestions that time with his mother should be more meaningful and unsupervised. On the other hand, it appears that with Billy, that comments made in his presence have the potential to throw him off a little bit more. I am very concerned about this tension between Mrs. B. and the foster-mother because it\u2019s clear that there is something there, and it has to be resolved.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">Accordingly, the hearing judge imposed the following conditions on Ms. B.\u2019s visitation with Billy W.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-5\">With Billy, the plan still remains the same. The question is, the supervision structure----[Ms. B.] should have contact, phone contact with Billy, and Billy should have phone contact with his mother.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-8\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-9\">What I want is Mrs. B. involved in [Billy W.\u2019s] therapy and that there would be at least two therapeutic visits before we resume unsupervised visits____I would like it done in a way that \u2014 I want [Ms. B.] involved in the therapy, and if there is a concern then the. therapist can articulate that and then I can get some input on why it should remain supervised only.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aq4\">The judge further determined that Ms. B.\u2019s visitation with Billy W. would remain three hours per week, but the unsupervised visitation would be suspended until Ms. B. completed two family therapy sessions with Billy W.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-12\">In regard to Ms. B.\u2019s visitation with George B., the judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-13\">With regard to George, I think that there should be some supervision still with the contact that [Ms. B.] has with him.... I would ask that the Department try to make the visits, while supervised, to do it if at all possible through a parent-aide, so that it\u2019s not Mrs. B. with the worker who is the person sort of in control of the situation, but with somebody with whom [Ms. B.] has a somewhat better or more relaxed relationship with. I would ask if you can explore whether the parent-aide would be available to supervise out-of-office visits, and at least twice a month, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>the visits, which would be likely, at least twice a month, that those would be out of the Agency. If those go well, and things stay on track and we don\u2019t have a recurrence on the types in the past, and comments, or problems that have been problematic, we can look again and do unsupervised. Right now I think we need to rein it back a little and have it under control.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">The hearing judge next addressed Mr. B.\u2019s visitation schedule with George B. and determined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-6\">The question as to visits for Mr. B. is complicated by the fact that ... I would not burden the Department with supervising visits if the Department\u2019s agents didn\u2019t reasonably feel that they were safe in his presence or felt threatened in his presence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-7\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-8\">To the extent that I would permit visits to continue it would only be done with an outside monitor in place and in a neutral site.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-9\">It is my understanding that some of the sheriffs that are off duty will monitor supervised visitation and they\u2019ll do it at a fee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-10\">I am advising [Mr. B.\u2019s Counsel] of that, that I would consider a proposal for supervised visits by an outside monitor who is an off-duty law enforcement person, but it\u2019s going to be at Mr. B.\u2019s expense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-11\">Essentially, the court advised that, because of Mr. B.\u2019s volatile behavior against DSS representatives during the visits, it would require that an off-duty officer supervise Mr. B.\u2019s once per month visitation, at the expense of Mr. B.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-12\">Both parents, represented by the Public Defender\u2019s Office, noted separate appeals to the Court of Special Appeals.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Ms. B.\u2019s brief presented the following question for review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>Did the trial judge err in admitting hearsay evidence at the permanency plan review hearing in these CINA cases?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AfM\">Mr. B.\u2019s brief presented the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-5\">Whether the trial court abused its discretion by denying Mr. B.\u2019s request to change the permanency plan to reunification with George B. and by eliminating visitation with him?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ANB\">This Court issued, on its own initiative, a writ of certiorari, <em>In re Billy </em>W., 384 Md. 448, 863 A.2d 997 (2004), prior to any proceedings in the intermediate appellate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">Appealability</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">In <em>In re Samone H. and Marchay E., </em>385 Md. 282, 869 A.2d 370 (2005), we considered whether an appeal would lie from an order entered after a permanency plan review hearing where the order continuing the permanency plan did not adversely affect the parental rights or change the terms of the permanency plan to the parent\u2019s detriment. In that case, the Circuit Court for Baltimore City previously had implemented permanency plans of adoption for two children, Samone H. and Marchay E., both of whom had been adjudicated children in need of assistance, based upon allegations of neglect by their mother, Katina M. <em>Id. </em>at 289, 869 A.2d at 374. After several periodic review hearings, Katina M. filed a request for a \u201cbonding study\u201d to have the children evaluated by a psychiatrist to provide an assessment of her relationship with her children. She also had the children subpoenaed to testify at another pending review hearing. During that hearing, the trial judge denied both requests and maintained the extant permanency plans for adoption, from which Katina M. appealed. On appeal, the Court of Special Appeals affirmed the judgment of the trial court, and this Court after granting certiorari, dismissed the appeal holding that \u201cthe trial court\u2019s order denying the motion for [bonding] study [was] not an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>appealable final judgment and [did] not constitute an interlocutory order under Section 12-803(x).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 316, 869 A.2d at 390.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">In reaching that conclusion, we explained that the court\u2019s order did not constitute a final judgment, and that it was not an appealable interlocutory order \u201c[bjecause the order continuing the permanency plan did not adversely affect Katina M.\u2019s parental rights or change the terms of the permanency plan to Katina M.\u2019s detriment....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 317, 869 A.2d at 391. We further noted that the court\u2019s order was not appeal-able under the collateral order doctrine because the order did not conclusively determine whether the permanency plans should have been changed, was not separate from the merits of the action, and would be reviewable on appeal if the denial had affected the mother\u2019s parental rights adversely. <em>Id. </em>at 316 n. 13, 869 A.2d at 390 n. 13. Thus, to be appealable interlocutory orders, court orders arising from the permanency plan review hearing must operate to either deprive the parent of the care and custody of his or her children or change the terms of the care and custody of the children to the parent\u2019s detriment. <em>Id. </em>at 298, 869 A.2d at 379.; <em>In re Damon M., </em>362 Md. 429, 438, 765 A.2d 624, 628 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">In the present case, both Ms. B. and Mr. B. are appealing orders of the Circuit Court emanating from a permanency plan review hearing that maintained the extant plans for the children but changed the visitation. Clearly, the orders cannot be regarded as final in nature; rather, the orders are interlocutory in nature and must act to detrimentally affect Ms. B. and Mr. B.\u2019s parental rights to be appeal-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>able under Section 12-303(3)(x) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article. <em>In re Samone H. </em>385 Md. at 299, 869 A.2d at 380; <em>In re Damon M., </em>362 Md. at 438, 765 A.2d at 628.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">The hearing judge changed Ms. B.\u2019s visitation with Jessica W. and Mary S. from partial weekly unsupervised visitation to total weekly unsupervised visitation. Obviously, such a change in Ms. B.\u2019s visitation does not operate to her detriment because she is allowed more unrestricted access to the girls. Conversely, the court orders relating to Billy W. and George B. , which eliminated Ms. B.\u2019s unsupervised visitation infringes upon Ms. B.\u2019s opportunities to interact with, and care for, the boys and to potentially build stronger relationships with them. Because the orders regarding Billy W. and George B. changed the terms of Ms. B.\u2019s visitation to her detriment, the orders are appealable as interlocutory orders under Section 12-303(3)(x). <em>See In re Samone H. </em>385 Md. at 299, 869 A.2d at 380; <em>In re Damon M., </em>362 Md. at 438, 765 A.2d at 628.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-8\">Similarly, the conditions placed on Mr. B.\u2019s visitation with George B., specifically that Mr. B. secure the services of an off-duty officer to supervise his visitation with George B., changed the terms of Mr. B.\u2019s care and custody to his detriment. During the hearing, Mr. B. explained that he did not have \u201cthe financial ability to contribute toward things,\u201d and his eligibility to be represented by the Office of the Public Defender throughout these proceedings tends to support that assertion. <em>See In re Adoption/Guardianship Nos. 11387 and 11388, </em>354 Md. 574, 587, 731 A.2d 972, 979 (1999) (holding that a natural parent is entitled to representation by Public Defender in hearing conducted to review children\u2019s status, as long as that parent is indigent). The court\u2019s requirement that Mr. B. hire an off-duty officer with his own resources constitutes a detrimental change in Mr. B.\u2019s visitation rights because the order operates as an effective denial of visitation should he not be able to afford to pay for the officer\u2019s services. Therefore, the order qualifies as an appealable interlocutory order. <em>See In re Samone H. </em>385 Md. at 299, 869 A.2d at 380; <em>In re Damon M., </em>362 Md. at 438, 765 A.2d at 628.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>PART I</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">Ms. B.\u2019s Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">Ms. B. argues that the trial court abused its discretion in admitting hearsay testimony<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> provided by a DSS social worker and two CASAs during the permanency planning hearing because the application of the rules of evidence in such hearings are mandatory despite Maryland Rule 5-101(c),<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> which allows for the discretionary application of the Rules in certain proceedings, including \u201cdisposition hearings\u201d under Maryland Rule 11-115 <footnotemark><em>14</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and \u201cmodification hearings\u201d under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>Maryland Rule 11-116.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Ms. B. distinguishes permanency planning hearings held under Section 3-823 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article from disposition hearings described under Maryland Rule 11-115d., because, according to her, the determinations made during permanency planning hearings are qualitatively different from those made in disposition hearings as contemplated under Rule 11\u2014115d. Ms. B. also asserts that permanency planning hearings are not modification hearings under Maryland Rule 11-116, characterizing the order issued as a result of a permanency planning hearing as a new order rather than modifying the court\u2019s original order.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">Conversely, the Department argues that the trial court properly exercised its discretion in admitting the hearsay testimony of the social worker and CASA during the perma<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>nency planning hearing because such a hearing is a dispositional hearing, which does not require mandatory application of the Rules of Evidence and permits the juvenile court to decide which rules should apply. The Department notes that the determinations made at a permanency planning hearing are virtually identical to those listed in Rule 11-115d. and that certain evidence may be considered by the court in permanency planning hearings that otherwise would not be admissible, including hearsay testimony by the social workers and the CASAs. According to the Department, because permanency planning hearings are properly considered disposition hearings, \u201cstrict application\u201d of the Rules of Evidence is not necessary, and the court did not abuse its discretion in declining to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">Application of the Rules of Evidence in Permanency Planning Hearings</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">In 1993, this Court adopted Title 5 of the Maryland Rules governing the admission of evidence during judicial proceedings.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Specifically, we approved Rule 5-101,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>delineates three categories of proceedings based upon the application of the Rules of Evidence. Subsection (a) provides the general rule that the rules of evidence apply to \u201call actions and proceedings in the courts of this State\u201d subject to certain exceptions. Md. Rule 5-101(a). Subsection (b) lists those proceedings in which the Rules of Evidence do not apply, except \u201cthose relating to the competency of witnesses.\u201d Md. Rule 5-101(b). Finally, subsection (c), entitled \u201cDiscretionary application,\u201d contains proceedings, including \u201cDisposition hearings under Rule 11\u2014115d.,\u201d in which the court, in its discretion, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>may decline to apply the Rules of Evidence. Md. Rule 5-101(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">In the present case, Ms. B. presents arguments similar to those of the petitioner in <em>In re Ashley E., Laione D., Matthew B., and Gregory B.-G., </em>387 Md. 260, 874 A.2d 998 (2005). Specifically, Ms. B. contends that disposition hearings under Rule 11-115d. are distinct from permanency planning hearings under Section 3-823 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, and therefore, under Rule 5-101, the juvenile court is required to strictly apply the Rules of Evidence in permanency planning hearings. To that end, she emphasizes that there are different determinations that the court must make under Section 3-823 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article as compared to what the court must accomplish to comply with the requirements under Rule 11-115d.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">In <em>In re Ashley E., </em>we rejected those arguments and held that permanency planning hearings are dispositional in nature and are properly characterized as disposition hearings under Rule 11-115d. As such, we concluded that \u201cthe court may, in the interest of justice, decline to require strict application\u201d of the Rules of Evidence \u201cother than those relating to the competency of witnesses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 294, 874 A.2d at 1019.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">We find our holding in <em>In re Ashley E., </em>to be dispositive of Ms. B.\u2019s arguments. Therefore, under <em>In re Ashley E., </em>the juvenile court in the case <em>sub judice, </em>could, in the interest of justice, decline to require strict application of the Rules of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>Evidence, other than those relating to the competency of witnesses. <em>Id. </em>at 294, 874 A.2d at 1019; Md. Rule 5-101(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">Admissibility of Hearsay Testimony in Permanency Planning Hearings</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">In the present case, we are called upon to address the criteria that should be utilized by the trial court to determine the admissibility of hearsay evidence in permanency planning hearings after we have declined to require strict application of the Rules of Evidence. Although this specific issue is one of first impression in this Court, we have had the opportunity to evaluate the criteria for admissibility of evidence when the evidentiary rules do not \u201cstrictly apply\u201d in sentencing hearings and administrative proceedings. <em>See Whittlesey v. State, </em>340 Md. 30, 71-72, 665 A.2d 223, 243 (1995) (noting that although \u201cthe strict Rules of Evidence do not apply at a sentencing proceeding .... [this] does not require the admission of unreliable evidence\u201d); <em>Baker v. State, </em>332 Md. 542, 558, 632 A.2d 783, 790 (1993) (stating that \u201cwhile the strict Rules of Evidence do not apply at a sentencing proceeding, unreliable hearsay is inadmissible\u201d); <em>State v. Dopkowski, </em>325 Md. 671, 680, 602 A.2d 1185, 1190 (1992) (same); <em>Woods, </em>315 Md. at 604, 556 A.2d at 242 (same); <em>Smith, </em>308 Md. at 166, 517 A.2d at 1083 (same); <em>Gorin v.

[o]ne of the requisites in such a proceeding is that the party who carries the burden of proving an issue adduce substantial evidence of probative value\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">Similarly, our colleagues on the Court of Special Appeals have explored the standards for admitting evidence when the Rules of Evidence do not strictly apply. <em>See In re Delric H., </em>150 Md.App. 234, 248-49, 819 A.2d 1117, 1126 (2003) (holding that \u201ceven though a court may decline to require a strict application of evidentiary rules [in juvenile restitution hearings], there still exists an inherent reliability/credibility requirement which a proponent of the offered evidence must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>satisfy\u201d). <em>See also Prince George\u2019s County v. Hartley, </em>150 Md.App. 581, 595, 822 A.2d 537, 545 (2003), quoting <em>Travers v. Baltimore Police Dep\u2019t, </em>115 Md.App. 395, 693 A.2d 378 (1997) (holding that the Rules of Evidence are relaxed in administrative proceedings; however, the evidence adduced \u201cmust demonstrate sufficient reliability and probative value to satisfy the requirements of procedural due process\u201d); <em>Kitchen v. State, </em>87 Md.App. 299, 303, 589 A.2d 575, 577 (1991) (determining that \u201cin probation revocation proceedings formal Rules of Evidence are not applied, and that <em>reasonably reliable </em>hearsay may be received\u201d) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">Consistent with this view, several of our sister states have held that in juvenile proceedings in which rules of evidence are not strictly applied, admissibility of evidence must be based upon reasonable indicia of reliability and trustworthiness. <em>See In re C.J., </em>328 Ill.App.3d 103, 262 Ill.Dec. 36, 764 N.E.2d 1153, 1160 (2002) (stating that in a juvenile proceeding the formal rules of evidence are relaxed and that \u201call evidence shall be admissible if it is relevant and reliable\u201d); <em>In re Sara M., </em>194 Cal.App.3d 585, 239 Cal.Rptr. 605, 611 (1987) (finding that the \u201crules of evidence are relaxed in dependency proceedings but expert evidence not shown to be reliable ... remains inadmis-' sible\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">Similarly, state courts addressing administrative proceedings in which the rules of evidence are relaxed have held that the evidence to be admitted must possess some degree of reliability and trustworthiness. <em>See e.g., Alix v. E-Z Serve Corporation, </em>846 So.2d 156, 159 (La.App.2003) (holding that in \u201cworkers\u2019 compensation matters, the technical rules of evidence are relaxed, but findings must nonetheless be based on \u2018competent evidence\u2019\u201d which is \u201cevidence [that] has some degree of reliability and trustworthiness and is of the type that reasonable persons would rely upon\u201d); <em>New London Housing Authority v. State Board of Labor Relations, </em>47 Conn.Supp. 624, 820 A.2d 332, 338 (2001) (noting that in administrative proceedings the rules of evidence are relaxed and that the court may consider any materials that are reliable and probative); <em>Bean v.

Ms. Caceres testified about Ms. B.\u2019s conduct and conversations during visits with the children, the children\u2019s feelings toward Ms. B., and the children\u2019s behavior following visits with Ms. B. Ms. Caceres\u2019s testimony also included statements concerning the progress of the children\u2019s therapy sessions based upon information provided by the psychologist conducting the therapy sessions. Most of the information that Ms. Caceres conveyed to the court was related to her direct observations of both parents and the children. Therefore, we conclude that Ms. Caceres\u2019 testimony was sufficiently reliable and probative based upon her responsibilities and opportunity to observe both parents and the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">Court Appointed Special Advocates</p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">Ms. B. also urges this court to determine that the trial court improperly admitted the testimony of the CASA volunteers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>during the hearing. The present case involves the use of CASAs in a juvenile proceeding, which previously has not been addressed by this Court or the Court of Special Appeals. Therefore, a discussion of CASAs and their role in such proceedings is warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">Because of growing concern regarding the lack of quality legal representation for abused and neglected children, in 1974 the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (\u201cCAPTA\u201d), was enacted by Congress. It required that \u201cin every case involving an abused or neglected child which results in a judicial proceeding a guardian ad litem shall be appointed to represent the child in such proceedings.\u201d Pub.L. No. 93-247, \u00a7 4(b)(2)(G), 88 Stat. 4 (1974), codified as 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5101-5107 (1994). In response to CAPTA\u2019s mandate, Judge David Soukup, a Superior Court Judge in Seattle, Washington, introduced the concept of utilizing volunteers to act as guardian ad litems (\u201cGAL\u201d)<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> for children in abuse and neglect cases, and in 1977, began a child advocacy program called Court Appointed Special Advocate (\u201cCASA\u201d). A CASA has been described as \u201ca trained community volunteer, appointed by a judge, to represent the best interests of children in cases that come before the court due to alleged abuse or neglect.\u201d National Court Appointed Special Advocate Association, Judge\u2019s Guide to CASA/GAL Program Development [hereinafter \u201cNCASAA Judge\u2019s Guide\u201d] 15 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">In 1982, a National Court Appointed Special Advocate Association [hereinafter \u201cNCASAA\u201d] was established to create <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>uniform standards for newly formed as well as expanding state programs. Thereafter, in 1990, Congress enacted the Victims of Child Abuse Act, which endorsed CASA programs and called for expanding the utilization of CASA volunteers by making them available to every victim of child abuse or neglect. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 13011-13014 (1994). In addition, the Act provides federal funds to develop statewide CASA programs and establishes criteria that a program requesting funds must meet to qualify. Victims of Child Abuse Act of 1990, Pub.L. No. 101-647, \u00a7 211. The statute requires, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-5\">1.

The programs also ensure that volunteers have regular, in-person contact with the child sufficient to have a working knowledge of the situation and to make factual recommendations to the court. <em>See </em>NCASAA Standards at 1. According to NCASAA\u2019s Standards for National CASA Association Member Programs, each CASA volunteer receives training consisting of approximately thirty hours of instruction, conducted by the local CASA program. <em>Id. </em>at 22. NCASAA recommends that CASA volunteers receive instruction in topics such as child sexual abuse, early childhood development, adolescent behavior, and advocacy techniques. <em>Id. </em>The NCASAA Standards require that CASAs should receive instruction in courtroom procedure from the principals in the system, <em>ie., </em>judges, attorneys, social workers, and court personnel. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b467-9\">According to the NCASAA Judge\u2019s Guide to CASA Program Development, a CASA volunteer, as a part of his or her duties, should:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-10\">1.

Moreover, CASA volunteers may be subject to dismissal for having taken action without program or court approval that endangers the child or outside the role or purview of the CASA program. The service of CASA volunteers also may be terminated for engaging in an ex parte communication with the court; violating a program policy, court rule, or the law; failing to complete required training or to carry out effectively his or her assigned duties; or if allegations of abuse or neglect are brought against the CASA. <em>See </em>NCASAA Standards at 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">To date, there is at least one CASA program in each of the fifty states, and the majority of states also have enacted statutes establishing CASA programs and defining the role that the CASA volunteers play in child abuse and neglect cases.

Most states have general statutes that establish CASA programs by defining the program\u2019s purpose and setting forth how the program is to be administered, including funding, training, selection, and supervision of the CASA volunteers, but do not define the role of CASA volunteers in juvenile and family proceedings beyond a generic description of those duties and responsibilities.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> These states utilize informal ways of integrating CASA volunteers into the judicial process by allowing the CASA program to formulate its own guidelines, procedures, and policies related to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>scope of the CASA\u2019s duties. In these instances, there is no statute or court rule that enumerates the extent of a CASA volunteer\u2019s involvement in the judicial process.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">Conversely, approximately fourteen states have formal mechanisms that are statutorily-mandated for defining the scope of a CASA volunteer\u2019s responsibilities in juvenile proceedings.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> For example, the State of California has a comprehensive statutory scheme that sets forth the requirements a CASA program must follow to be recognized and specifically defines the CASA volunteer\u2019s duties to include interviewing and observing the parties involved in the case, reviewing relevant records and reports, filing a report with the court, and monitoring cases assigned to the volunteer by the judge. <em>See </em>Cal. Welf. <em>&amp; </em>Inst.Code \u00a7 100-104 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">Similarly, the State of Colorado has a statutory scheme that enumerates the duties and responsibilities of a CASA volunteer, which include: conducting independent investigations regarding the child, providing factual background information to the court in the form of a report, interviewing relevant individuals, reviewing records, making recommendations to the court, and testifying in court proceedings. <em>See </em>Colo.Rev.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 13-91-105 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">Other state statutes have allowed CASA volunteers a more expansive role in advocating for the child. In those instances, the CASA volunteer is permitted to participate in depositions, negotiations, discovery, pretrial conferences, hearings, and appeals. <em>See e.g., </em>Ariz.Rev.Stat. Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 8-522 to 523 (1991); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>Del.Code Ann. tit. 81, \u00a7 3608-3610 (2000); Kan. Stat. Ann. 38-1606a. (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">In Maryland, the Court-Appointed Special Advocate Program was enacted to establish the use of CASAs in juvenile proceedings. <em>See </em>1989 Md. Laws, Chap. 641. The statute has not changed substantively since its enactment and was recodified as Maryland Code (1989, 2002 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 3-830 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, in 2001.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The Maryland CASA Program is county-oriented and is dependent on court<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> appointment of trained volunteers whose primary pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>pose is to ensure that children who are the subject of a CINA proceeding are afforded appropriate services and case planning that is in their best interests. <em>See </em>Md.Code, \u00a7 3-830(a)(3) and (b)(2) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">Maryland\u2019s CASA statute provides a generic description of a CASA volunteer\u2019s responsibilities and functions in a juvenile proceeding. According to the statute, a court may appoint a CASA volunteer to \u201c[p]rovide the court with background information to aid it in making decisions in the child\u2019s best interest; and to [ejnsure that the child is provided appropriate case planning and services.\u201d Md.Code, \u00a7 3-830(a)(3) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article. Rather than explicitly outlining the duties and responsibilities of CASA volunteers, the statute authorizes the Administrative Office of the Courts to \u201cadopt rules governing the implementation and operation of the Program including funding, training, selection, and supervision of volunteers.\u201d Md.Code, \u00a7 3-830(b)(3)(iii) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">The Guidelines adopted by the Administrative Office of the Courts in 1989 dictate how the CASA programs are to be structured and operated, the requirements for volunteer training and supervision, and the funding requirements for the programs. <em>See </em>Administrative Office of Courts CASA Rules and Guidelines [hereinafter \u201cAOC CASA Guidelines\u201d], 1 (2004). The Guidelines describe the role of the CASA volunteer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-7\">The CASA volunteer is considered a Friend of the Court and does not have party status. The volunteer is considered an agent of the court and is appointed at the judge\u2019s discretion to represent the child\u2019s best interests. Volunteers are not represented by an attorney but should be provided access to legal counsel by the program.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b474-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>AOC CASA Guidelines-at 1. The Guidelines also define the responsibilities of a CASA volunteer, those being: to review the case history and juvenile court file; to meet with the CASA staff to develop a case plan; to schedule and attend appointments with relevant parties; to complete required CASA forms and documentation; to maintain the confidentiality of any and all information received on behalf of the child; and to submit a written report to the court. <em>See </em>AOC CASA Guidelines at 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">CASA volunteers have been permitted to testify in court proceedings and submit recommendations relating to child placement. <em>See e.g., In re Justin D., </em>357 Md. 431, 438, 745 A.2d 408, 412 (2000) (permitting CASA volunteer-to recommend during a permanency planning review hearing that child\u2019s permanency plan should remain one of long-term foster care). We are called upon here to delineate the boundaries for testimony by a CASA volunteer in a permanency planning hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">During the hearing in the case <em>sub judice, </em>the trial court, <em>sua sponte, </em>called the CASA volunteers assigned to the case by the Circuit Court to testify during the hearing. Each CASA volunteer then testified, while not under oath, about statements made by the children and the children\u2019s foster-mother in addition to clarifying certain factual statements made in a report submitted to the court and reviewed by the parties. The CASAs\u2019 testimony primarily consisted of statements made by the children expressing their feelings toward Ms. B. and the children\u2019s behavior following visits with Ms. B. The CASAs conveyed facts to the court that were based upon their direct observations of the children and meetings with the foster-mother. As such, we conclude that the testimony provided by each CASA volunteer was reliable and probative of the issues relating to the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">Although we have stated previously, that the court may, in the interest of justice, decline to require strict application of the Rules of Evidence, it must strictly adhere to rules relating to the competency of witnesses. <em>See In re Ashley E., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>387 Md. at 294, 874 A.2d at 1019 (holding that in permanency-planning hearings \u201cthe court may, in the interest of justice, decline to require strict application of the rules of evidence other than those relating to the competency of witnesses\u201d), quoting Md. Rule 5-101(c). One competency requirement is contained in Maryland Rule 5-603, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-5\">Before testifying, a witness shall be required to declare that the witness will testify truthfully. The declaration shall be by oath or affirmation administered either in the form specified by Rule 1-303 or, in special circumstances, in some other form of oath or affirmation calculated to impress upon the witness the duty to tell the truth.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">In this instance, the trial judge required each witness, except the CASAs, to take an oath prior to testifying at the permanency planning hearing, including the social workers who testified. Clearly, the CASA volunteers should have been required to comply with the dictates of Rule 5-603, but the omission of such was waived in the present case when the parties failed to object on this basis. <em>See Perry v. State, </em>381 Md. 138, 848 A.2d 631 (2004), in which we held that, \u201c[i]f incompetency is not known when the witness is called, an objection should be made as soon as the incompetency becomes apparent. Otherwise the objection is waived.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 146 n. 4, 848 A.2d at 636 n. 4. <em>See also Schaefer v. Cusack, </em>124 Md.App. 288, 313, 722 A.2d 73, 86 (1998) (holding that \u201cobjection to a witness\u2019s testifying who has not made an oath or affirmation will be considered waived unless made before the testimony or, if the witness is not on the stand as soon as it should be apparent that the witness is testifying\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">Ms. B. further argues, however, that the trial judge improperly admitted hearsay testimony of the CASAs because she did not have an adequate opportunity to cross-examine the CASAs during the permanency planning hearing. CASAs, when they testify in permanency planning review hearings, must be subject to cross-examination, as any other witness. <em>See Mayor and Council of Rockville v. Woodmont Country Club, </em>348 Md. 572, 582, 705 A.2d 301, 306 (1998) (holding that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>in administrative proceedings the parties have a right to reasonable cross-examination of witnesses); <em>Imperial v. Drapeau, </em>351 Md. 38, 716 A.2d 244 (1998) (determining that in administrative proceedings the parties must be afforded an opportunity to cross-examine the witnesses); <em>Town of Somerset, </em>245 Md. at 66, 225 A.2d at 302 (holding that in administrative proceedings \u201c[a]ll parties must be fully apprised of the evidence submitted or to be considered, and must be given the opportunity to cross-examine witnesses\u201d). This issue, however, was not preserved by sufficient objection at the trial court level, so that we do not have occasion to review it.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">HARRELL, J. as to Part II, joined by RAKER, WILNER, and GREENE, J J.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">PART II</p>\n<p id=\"Ax-\">Mr. B\u2019s Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">The Court is divided as to the proper disposition of Mr. B\u2019s appeal. Thus, the Court\u2019s opinion is serialized, of necessity.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">Mr. B. asserts that the trial court abused its discretion in maintaining the extant permanency plan and supervised visitation of one visit per month, with George B., neither of which is appealable under our decision in <em>In re Samone H., </em>385 Md. at 316, n. 13, 869 A.2d at 390, n. 13. Judge Battaglia, for the Court, disposed of this issue in Part I of the Court\u2019s opinion. Mr. B. also argues that the Circuit Court erred in requiring him to pay for off-duty law enforcement to supervise the visitations with George B., inasmuch as such a condition operated to eliminate virtually his visitation with George B. because of Mr. B.\u2019s claimed indigence.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">DSS argues that the trial court properly exercised its discretion in maintaining the permanency plan and imposing the added condition on Mr. B.\u2019s future visitations. In support of its contention, DSS notes that the trial court\u2019s requirement that Mr. B. hire an officer to monitor the visitation was warranted, given Mr. B.\u2019s past history of sexual abuse and inability to control himself during a prior visit with George B.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>Decisions concerning visitation generally are within the sound discretion of the trial court, and are not to be disturbed unless there has been a clear abuse of discretion. <em>In re Yve S., </em>373 Md. 551, 566-67, 819 A.2d 1030, 1039 (2003); <em>In re Mark M., </em>365 Md. 687, 705-06, 782 A.2d 332, 343 (2001). The court must decide and set forth the \u201cminimal amount of visitation that is appropriate and that DSS must provide, as well as any basic conditions that it believes, as a minimum, should be imposed.\u201d <em>In re Justin D., </em>357 Md. 431, 450, 745 A.2d 408, 418 (2000). Because the trial court is required to make such determinations in the best interests of the child, visitation may be restricted or even denied when the child\u2019s health or welfare is threatened. <em>In re Yve S., </em>373 Md. at 566-67, 819 A.2d at 1039; <em>In re Mark M. </em>365 Md. at 705-06, 782 A.2d at 343. Where the child has been declared a child in need of assistance because of abuse or neglect, the trial court is constrained further by the requirements of Section 9-101 of the Family Law Article when setting the conditions of visitation. Section 9-101 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-5\">(a) <em>Determination by court. </em>\u2014 In any custody or visitation proceeding, if the court has reasonable grounds to believe that a child has been abused or neglected by a party to the proceeding, the court shall determine whether abuse or neglect is likely to occur if custody or visitation rights are granted to the party.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-6\">(b) <em>Specific finding required. </em>\u2014 Unless the court specifically finds that there is no likelihood of further child abuse or neglect by the party, the court shall deny custody or visitation rights to that party, except that the court may approve a supervised visitation arrangement that assures the safety and the physiological, psychological, and emotional well-being of the child.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">Md.Code (1974, 1999 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 9-101 of the Family Law Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">Thus, when a court has reasonable grounds to believe that neglect or abuse has occurred, as did the court in this case, custody or visitation must be denied, except for super<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>vised visitation, unless the court makes a specific finding that there is no likelihood of further abuse or neglect. <em>In re Yve S., </em>373 Md. at 566-67, 819 A.2d at 1039. If the court determines, as an exception, that supervised visitation is appropriate, the court must assure, at a minimum, that such visitation will not jeopardize the safety and well-being of the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">As a part of our review of the present case, we must scrutinize the factual findings of the juvenile court. The juvenile judge\u2019s findings with respect to Mr. B.\u2019s visitation with George B. during the hearing, and in support of her subsequent order, were as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-6\">Mr. B. is\u2014I mean, the argument to me, essentially, is that he is not at risk of abusing his child, and therefore, the plan should be reunification with Ms. B., and his contacts should be unsupervised.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-7\">This difficulty that I have with the argument is the following: Mr. B. has acknowledged, and I credit his candor, but he has acknowledged sexually abusing three children.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-8\">* * <em>*</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-9\">The ripple and collateral affect of that have been tremendous. And the problem with abuse is that it\u2019s not simply the abuse on the direct victim, but the lies and the coverups, and the ripples throughout the family that are just incredibly long-lasting, and they have tremendous impacts on children. And this case, if nothing else, points to that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-10\">The fact that Mr. B. would not sexually abuse his own child does not answer the question of whether it would be appropriate for him to be the person who should have parenting responsibility for the child; because the failures and lapses in judgment that were part and parcel of the problems surrounding the abuse, while being addressed at some extent in therapy, they still exist.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-11\">And the other piece of that is that Mr. B. has demonstrated issues in anger management that are not insignificant. He is addressing those also therapeutically.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>I commend his candor on the stand and the fact that he is extremely dedicated to do the things that he is required to do in therapy and on probation. There is still a lot of work to be done.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-4\">The difficulty is, the thing that\u2019s the sole focus of the anger right now is this case. It completely undermines his ability to work with the Department or to accept the opinions or views of others if they run counter to what he thinks.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-5\">And that has been demonstrated in recent contacts at the Department and with the social workers, the most recent one giving rise to an incident involving police officers, whose view of what happened that day I found far more credible than Mr. B. I don\u2019t think he intentionally \u2014 I just think that he sees the world in very different ways.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-6\">The question as to visits for Mr. B. is complicated by the fact that ... I would not burden the Department with supervising visits if the Department\u2019s agents didn\u2019t reasonably feel that they were safe in his presence or felt threatened in his presence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-7\">But, they do feel threatened in his presence, and I think there is demonstrable reason for that. I still, though have the difficulty of whether the child should have some contact with his father, and I am truly struggling with that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-8\">Mr. B. is working right now and he has some financial ability to contribute towards things.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-9\">[MR. B]: I don\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-10\">[THE COURT]: Well, that\u2019s going to be a problem for you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-11\">[MR. B.]: In a few months. Right now I\u2019m paying a lot. My medical benefits are cut off and there are probationary requirements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-12\">[THE COURT]: Mr B., now is not the time for you to be speaking.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>To the extent that I would permit visits to continue it would only be done with an outside monitor in place and in a neutral site.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-5\">It is my understanding that some of the sheriffs that are off duty will monitor supervised visitation and they\u2019ll do it at a fee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-6\">I am advising [Mr. B.\u2019s Counsel] of that, that I would consider a proposal for supervised visits by an outside monitor who is an off-duty law enforcement person, but it\u2019s going to be at Mr. B.\u2019s expense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-7\">[MR. B.\u2019S COUNSEL]: Your Honor, if the Young Fathers/Responsible Fathers program that Mr. H. represents, if they have a function like that, or a program like that, would that be acceptable?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-8\">[THE COURT]: I want it to be something that I have very tight controls over, for what the parameters are for the visitation, because, quite frankly, Mr. B. will push the bounds of whatever I set, so I\u2019m not sure that I am going to go with a program like that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-9\">I would allow an outside supervisor who would be an off-duty police officer who would be doing one-on-one supervision, and do it, again, as a monthly visit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-10\">It will be at his expense, and it will be his burden to come up with a plan for it, because he forfeited the right to have the Department supervise it as a function of his own behavior and conduct in visits, and I found the evidence on that to be overwhelmingly credible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-11\">So, I\u2019m not going to have social workers feeling at risk in his presence. When visits were going smoothly, they don\u2019t. As soon as anything happens, when it doesn\u2019t go the way he thinks that it should be, they have felt threatened, and I find reasonably so, and in fact he acted out with a police officer, with several officers. So, that would be the restriction on the visitation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-12\">Based upon the judge\u2019s findings, there were reasonable grounds to believe that a child had been abused by Mr. B. because of Mr. B.\u2019s acknowledgment to the court that previ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>ously he abused three children. We have held that neglect or abuse of a child in the past refers to the abuse or neglect of <em>any </em>child in the past, not only the child at issue in the current proceeding. <em>See In re Adoption No. 12612, </em>353 Md. 209, 725 A.2d 1037 (1999). Therefore, unless the judge made a specific finding that no future abuse or neglect was likely to occur, she was required to deny visitation to Mr. B. or order supervised visitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">Vacation of the judgment as to Michael B.\u2019s case, as called for in the dissent, is unwarranted on this record and is premised on a misapplication of the provisions of \u00a7 9\u2014101(b) of the Family Law Article. For the reasons to be explained, affirmance of the trial court\u2019s judgment is in order.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">The dissent postulates that if Mr. B.\u2019s <em>proffer </em>to the trial court that he could not pay for the services of an off-duty police officer is credited, then he effectively has been denied visitation. The premise of this position, in the Majority\u2019s view, contains an inaccurate assumption and is unsupported in the record. During direct examination of Michael B. by his counsel at the Circuit Court hearing on 5 May 2004, the following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-7\">Q. Has the Department ever asked you to pay child support?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-8\">A. Nobody asked me to pay child support.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-9\">Q.

There was no Court proceeding?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-14\">A. No. Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-15\">Q. And you have no problem paying child support for Georgie?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-16\">A. Right. It\u2019s not necessary for me, for my wages to be garnished for it, because I offer everything that I have to my son, his mother and the rest of the children.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>* * :l=</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-5\">A. \u2014 I\u2019m trying to attend school.

Mr. B., you are living at 102 East 20th Street; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-8\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-9\">Q. And what is that, a house or an apartment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-10\">A. It\u2019s a two-level. I live in the first level of the apartment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-11\">Q. You rent your own apartment there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-12\">A. Yes. I have the whole first level.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AY3\">Q. And you said that you are employed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-14\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-15\">Q. Where do you work?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-16\">A. Right now I work at \u2014 through the plumbers and steamfitters union. I work for Herton (phonetic) Mechanical and I also do part-time work at my old temp agency Ready-Staffing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-17\">Q. Your work, is it a full-time job?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-18\">A. Full-time.

In the absence of any evidence as to what his financial condition was at the time counsel was assigned to him by the Public Defender\u2019s Office,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the presumed determination of indigency at that time means only that he was then \u201cfinancially unable, without undue hardship, to provide <em>full </em>payment of an attorney and <em>all </em>other necessary expenses of legal representation\u201d (Md.Code 1957, 2003 Repl.Vol.), Art. 27A, \u00a7 2(f) (emphasis added), made applicable by \u00a7 5-323 of the Family Law Article. The determination of Mr. B.\u2019s indigency for legal representation purposes obviously was made well before the facts as to his 17 March 2004 employment were adduced at the 5 May 2004 Circuit Court hearing. The hearing judge was entitled to consider the most current information in reaching her decision.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> That information was ample to support affirmance on this record.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>The dissent\u2019s reasoning that the off-duty law enforcement officer condition for continuation of the one hour per month supervised visitation must be supported by an explicit finding that the officer was needed for the \u201csafety, physiological, psychological, and emotional well-being\u201d of George B. is not a statutory requirement. Even if it was, such a finding was implicit in the judge\u2019s ruling, in light of the record of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">Unlike apparently the dissent, we do not construe \u00a7 9-101(b) of the Family Law Article as requiring the trial court to find expressly that there \u201cis no likelihood of further child abuse or neglect\u201d by Michael B. before it may impose the relevant condition challenged in Michael B\u2019s appeal. First, the grammatical structure, i.e., hence the plain meaning, of \u00a7 9-101(b) permits, as an exception to the finding requirement that must be made generally to allow custody or visitation in the face of pre-existing abuse/neglect, the trial court to establish supervised visitation as long as the arrangements assure the safety and well-being of the child.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-6\">\u00a7 9-101.

No express findings are required to be made by the trial court in that regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">There was testimony before the trial judge that, at the 18 February 2004 supervised visitation between George B. and Michael B., it took four police officers to subdue Michael B. and that George B. saw what happened (testimony of Ms. Kristy Caceres and Officer Katie Winders at the 23 April 2004 hearing). Michael B. became unruly, yelling at social workers and refusing to leave when the visitation was terminated. In the course of ostensibly trying to prolong his visit with George B., Michael B. attempted to shove past Officer Winders by placing his shoulder into the officer\u2019s chest in an effort to move her from the doorway blocking his access to George B. Observing his father\u2019s conduct, George B. seemed frightened, confused, and shocked, according to Ms. Caceres. Thus, the record supports that it was not merely for the protection of the social workers that the trial judge imposed the condition that future visitations would be monitored, at Michael B.\u2019s expense, by an off-duty law enforcement officer.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Clearly, an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>additional goal of that condition was to inhibit Michael B. from causing further deleterious effects on George B.\u2019s psychological and emotional well-being.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">In any event, there is no indication in the record extract or any argument mounted by a party that the trial court failed to make any required statutory findings when it established, as the result of past periodic reviews, supervised visitation between Michael B. and George B. in December 2002 and continued such in June 2008 and November 2003. We fail to see why additional findings are required in the 6 May 2004 order continuing supervised visitation for the same one hour per month, but adding the additional condition of engagement of the off-duty officer, a condition occasioned solely by Michael B.\u2019s misconduct at the 18 February 2004 visitation. If Michael B. has additional evidence bearing on his inability to pay for the off-duty officer (or that such a condition is no longer necessary), he may present it at a subsequent periodic review hearing in the Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">Accordingly, the judgment in Michael B.\u2019s case also is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">AS TO PART I, MS.

I would find that the trial court failed to comport with the requirements of Section 9-101 of the Family Law Article in restructuring Mr. B.\u2019s supervised visitation. In addition, I would conclude that the trial court failed to make adequate findings concerning Mr. B.\u2019s ability to pay for the services of an officer prior to including such a provision as a condition of his supervised visitation. Therefore, in my opinion the judgment of the Circuit Court as to Mr. B. should be reversed and Mr. B.\u2019s case should be remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">The trial court is constrained by the requirements of Section 9-101 of the Family Law Article when setting the conditions of visitation. Section 9-101 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-8\">(a) <em>Determination by court. </em>\u2014 In any custody or visitation proceeding, if the court has reasonable grounds to believe that a child has been abused or neglected by a party to the proceeding, the court shall determine whether abuse or neglect is likely to occur if custody or visitation rights are granted to the party.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-9\">(b) <em>Specific finding required. </em>\u2014 Unless the court specifically finds that there is no likelihood of further child abuse or neglect by the party, <em>the court shall deny custody or visitation rights to that party, except that the court may approve a supervised visitation arrangement that assures the safety and the physiological, psychological, and emotional well-being of the child.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b488-10\">Md.Code (1974, 1999 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 9-101 of the Family Law Article (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-11\">Thus, when a court has reasonable grounds to believe that neglect or abuse has occurred, as did the court in this case, custody or visitation must be denied, except for supervised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>visitation, unless the court makes a specific finding that there is no likelihood of further abuse or neglect. <em>See In re Yve S., </em>378 Md. 551, 566-68, 819 A.2d 1030, 1039-40 (2003). If 'the court determines that supervised visitation is appropriate, the court must assure that such visitation will not jeopardize the safety and well-being of the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">The court ordered that Mr. B. would have supervised visitation with George B. on the condition that Mr. B. pay for a law enforcement officer to supervise the visitation, due to safety concerns for DSS representatives who were managing the visits. Although the safety of DSS representatives is an important concern, it is not within the findings necessary to satisfy the statutory prerequisites for the approval of a \u201csupervised visitation arrangement,\u201d because the court is only to approve such an arrangement if it assures the \u201csafety, physiological, psychological, and emotional well-being\u201d of the child. <em>See </em>Md.Code (1974, 1999 Repl.Vol.) \u00a7 9-101(b) of the Family Law Article. In the present case, the trial court never correlated the need to restructure the supervised visitation with George B.\u2019s well-being. Rather, the court\u2019s focus was <em>solely </em>on concerns for the safety of DSS representatives.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">Further, the trial court\u2019s prerequisite that Mr. B. pay for an officer to supervise the visitation without determining his ability to pay for such services is problematic. The record clearly establishes that Mr. B. previously had been determined to be indigent when he qualified for representation by the Public Defender\u2019s Office. Moreover, when the trial judge stated that Mr. B. could \u201ccontribute toward things,\u201d Mr. B. proffered to the court that he would be unable to contribute because he was \u201cpaying a lot,\u201d his \u201cmedical benefits were cut off\u2019 and he had other probationary requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">The Majority relies on statements made by Mr. B. while testifying on his ability to care for George B., to support its conclusion that \u201cMr. B. likely could afford the additional condition of continued supervised visitation.\u201d Maj. op. at 454. When testifying, Mr. B. stated that he had a job and had to pay for his medical expenses. His testimony, however, did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>specify the extent of his obligations and was not an exploration of the available options for supervised visitation. As an alternative to Mr. B. paying for an off-duty officer, counsel for Mr. B. requested to have the visitation supervised under the Young Fathers/Responsible Fathers program; however, the trial court declined that option and embraced the off-duty officer alternative without determining the extent of Mr. B.\u2019s financial resources to pay for an officer, the cost of which was never established. In light of the lack of factual findings regarding Mr. B.\u2019s financial capabilities, the trial court should have made findings about Mr. B.\u2019s ability to pay for the off-duty officer before conditioning his visitation on securing such services.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">Additionally, I suspect that conditioning visitation upon the ability to pay for the services of an off-duty officer may present constitutional problems because a parent without financial resources could effectively be denied visitation as a result of indigency, whereas a parent with adequate financial resources would not. Although a trial judge may set reasonable conditions on a parent\u2019s visitation, such conditions must comport with basic constitutional requirements, including equal protection of the law.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See In re Laurence T., </em>285 Md. 621, 630, 403 A.2d 1256, 1261 (1979) (holding that juvenile in delinquency proceeding was denied equal protection when the State\u2019s decision to file a petition against the juvenile was based upon his parent\u2019s ability to pay restitution); <em>Raible v.

As to the availability of such officers to perform the services contemplated by the trial judge, it appears that certain sheriff\u2019s deputies in Baltimore County have performed in the same or similar capacities in the past.

A policy comment is in order, particularly for the benefit of other courts around the State, about the apparent direction given by the trial judge to the effect Michael B. locate, engage, and directly compensate an off-duty law enforcement officer to monitor future supervised visitations. Although we have no doubt that Michael B. may, and on this record should, be held responsible financially for implementation of the provision of additional security (occasioned by his misconduct) at the supervised visitations, it may not be appropriate, for policy, administration, and efficiency reasons, to make Michael B. directly the employer of the security person or, for that matter, that the universe of persons suitable to supply security be limited to off-duty law enforcement personnel. Although this record suggests that in Baltimore County off-duty deputy sheriffs have provided such services in the past (see Fn. 3, supra), such may not be the case elsewhere throughout the State. Moreover, having the parent responsible for identifying the particular personnel, engaging him or her, and paying the person directly may blur the \"chain of command\u201d probably intended by the trial court and/or the clarity with which the discharge of the security responsibilities is perceived by the security person. It may be more appropriate, for example, to direct DSS to engage an appropriate security person and for the parent to be responsible financially to DSS for the reasonable compensation for the service. In any event, no observation offered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>here is intended to suggest that this Court is acting other than to affirm the judgment in Mr. B.\u2019s appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b490-6\">.
