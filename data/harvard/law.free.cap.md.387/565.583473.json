The Commission charged respondent with violating the following Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct: (1) Rule 1.1 Competence,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (2) Rule 1.2 Scope of Representation,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (3) Rule 1.3 Diligence,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (4) Rule 1.4 Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>munieation,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (5) Rule 1.5 Fees,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (6) Rule 1.7 Conflict of Interest: General Rule,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (7) Rule 1.16 Declining or Terminating Representation,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and (8) Rule 8.4 Misconduct.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Pursuant to Maryland Rule 16-752(a), we referred the matter to Judge Steven I. Platt of the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County to make findings of fact and proposed conclusions of law. Judge Platt held an evidentiary hearing and concluded that respondent had violated Rules 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4(a) and (b), 1.7(b), 1.16(a)(1), and 8.4(e) and (d) of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">Judge Platt made the following findings of fact and conclusions of law:</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">\n<em>FINDINGS OF FACT</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">\u201cThe material facts of this case are not in dispute. Respondent was admitted to the Bar of the Court of Appeals of Maryland on January 9, 1989. She is also admitted to practice law in the District of Columbia and Minnesota. Respondent, since 1991, has continuously maintained an office for the practice of law at 9200 Basil Court, Suite 111, Upper Marlboro, Maryland 20774, where she is a sole practitioner. Respondent is an experienced practitioner in the areas of personal injury and family law, among others.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">\u201cOn September 15, 1999, Denise Haynes-Butler (hereinafter \u2018Mrs. Butler\u2019) was involved in a motor vehicle accident with Mr. James Tidd (hereinafter \u2018Mr. Tidd\u2019). Mrs. Butler sustained injuries as a consequence of the motor vehicle accident. On September 20, 1999, Mrs. Butler and her husband, Gary Butler (hereinafter \u2018Mr. Butler\u2019) retained Respondent to pursue their claims against Mr. Tidd arising from the motor vehicle accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-8\">\u201cA written Retainer Agreement was signed by Mr. and Mrs. Butler on September 20, 1999, providing for Respondent to receive a contingent legal fee of one-third (1/3) of the total recovery obtained by way of settlement or forty percent (40%) of the total recovery obtained by settlement or judgment after suit was filed as payment for her legal services on their behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-9\">\u201cMr. Tidd was insured by Arnica Mutual Insurance Company (hereinafter \u2018Arnica\u2019). Nationwide Insurance Company insured Mr. and Mrs. Butler. After consultation, the Butlers informed the Respondent that they would agree to a sum of not less than ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>fully settle their claims against Mr. Tidd and Arnica. Respondent, on behalf of the Butlers, and Arnica discussed settlement of the claims. The Respondent demanded over $20,000.00 for settlement of the Butlers\u2019 personal injury claim. Arnica, in turn, extended a settlement offer of $9,500.00. Unfortunately, Respondent and Arnica were unable to reach a settlement. During the period of representation, however, the Respondent successfully negotiated the settlement of the property damage claim resulting from the motor vehicle accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\">\u201cOn August 12, 2002, the Respondent filed a Complaint, <em>Butler v. Tidd </em>(hereinafter \u2018Butler Complaint\u2019), in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County against Mr. Tidd for negligence and loss of consortium and Nationwide Insurance Company for uninsured/underinsured motorist and personal injury protection claims on behalf of Mr. and Mrs. Butler. The Butler Complaint was filed two months before the Statute of Limitations tolled. Simultaneously with the submission of the Butler Complaint, the Respondent submitted another Complaint, <em>Brown v. Austin </em>(hereinafter \u2018Brown Complaint\u2019), in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County Maryland. Although the captions on these two Complaints were different, the Clerk\u2019s Office mistakenly assigned the two Complaints the same case number \u2014 CAL02-19945. The Brown Complaint was the only Complaint that the Clerk\u2019s Office showed a record for having been properly filed and docketed.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">\u201cThe Respondent did not recognize the mistake made by the Clerk\u2019s Office until, on or about, October 28, 2002, when she received a letter from Mrs. Kimberly Massey, an adjuster with Arnica, acknowledging receipt of the Butler Complaint and requesting verification of the date in which the summons and Complaint was filed in the Butler case. The letter also advised the Respondent that the case number provided did not correspond with the plaintiffs and defendants in the Butler Complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">\u201cRespondent acknowledges that two checks were issued, by her office, in the amount of $100 on August 12, 2002: one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>check, Check No. 1413, drawn from her escrow account for the filing of the Brown Complaint and another check, Check No.1910, drawn from her operating account for the filing of the Butler Complaint. Check No. 1413 was negotiated by the Prince George\u2019s County Circuit County Clerk\u2019s Office on August 15, 2002. The Respondent received a returned copy of Check No. 1413 with her August 2002 bank statement. Check No.1910, which was written for the filing fees associated with the Butler Complaint was never negotiated by the Clerk\u2019s Office.</p>\n<p id=\"AYo\">\u201cUpon learning of this error, on or about, October 28, 2002, Respondent contacted the Clerk\u2019s Office to determine what actions would be necessary to correct the error. The Respondent was advised by the Clerk\u2019s Office that she needed to submit the file stamped copy of the Butler Complaint and the cancelled check for the filing fee. It was at this time that Respondent became aware that Check No.1910 was never negotiated. The Statute of Limitations had expired on the Butlers\u2019 claim at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">\u201cOn November 9, 2002, the Respondent sent a letter to the attorney for Arnica, Timothy E. Howie, Esquire, indicating that the Statute of Limitations had passed on the Butlers\u2019 claim before the error was brought to her attention and he could \u2018close [his] file on this claim.\u2019 Thereafter, the Respondent agreed to sign and present to the court a joint Line of Dismissal With Prejudice in the Butler case. This line of dismissal was filed on January 9, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">\u201cThe Respondent did not advise Mr. or Mrs. Butler of the error that occurred with the filing of their Complaint. The Respondent did not advise Mr. or Mrs. Butler that their case was dismissed with prejudice and that the Statute of Limitations now barred their claim. Furthermore, the Respondent did not consult with either Mr. or Mrs. Butler regarding the dismissal of their Complaint with prejudice nor did she receive their consent to dismiss their claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">\u201cThe Respondent then decided that she would not disclose the dismissal of the claim to her clients, the Butlers. Rather she would attempt to make them whole by paying them <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>what she thought would placate them and what she perceived to be fair to them, <em>i.e., </em>the sum of $10,000.00 out of her own personal funds. It was also at this time that the Respondent sought the legal and ethical advice of N. Frank Wiggins, Esquire (hereinafter \u2018Mr. Wiggins\u2019).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\">\u201cMr. Wiggins, at the time, was a partner at the law firm of Venable, Baetjer, Howard and Civiletti. He is a 1972 graduate of the University of Michigan Law School. He taught at Northwestern University Law School for three years. The Respondent worked for Mr. Wiggins at his previous law firm, Cohn and Marks, for approximately four and one-half years. Over the years, the Respondent and Mr. Wiggins have maintained personal contact with one another, often consulting with each other on legal matters. In addition, Mr. Wiggins represented the Respondent in <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Pennington, </em>355 Md. 61, 733 A.2d 1029 (1999). Mr. Wiggins is not admitted to practice law in the State of Maryland. He is <em>only </em>admitted to practice law in the District of Columbia.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">\u201cThe Respondent advised Mr. Wiggins of the events that transpired and sought his counsel and advice on her plan to pay the Butlers from her own personal funds. Specifically, Respondent sought reassurance from Mr. Wiggins that her payment to her clients out of her personal funds and her nondisclosure of the facts would not in any way violate any laws or rules of ethical conduct in Maryland, or otherwise cause any problems for her or the Butlers. After researching the matter, Mr. Wiggins opined incorrectly to the Respondent that no disclosure was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">\u201cOn February 6, 2003, the Respondent met with Mr. and Mrs. Butler. During this meeting, the Respondent presented the Butlers a document entitled \u2018Statement of Settlement.\u2019 The Respondent did not disclose to the Butlers that the check they would receive would not come from the settlement of their case but, instead, directly from the Respondent\u2019s own funds. The \u2018Statement of Settlement\u2019 presented to the Butlers was derived from a form that Respondent customarily utilized when she disbursed funds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>obtained through settlement of claims with third parties for the benefit of her clients. In fact, the Butlers were presented with a similar \u2018Statement of Settlement\u2019 in September 29, 1999, relating to their settlement of the property damage claim with Arnica.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">\u201cThe \u2018Statement of Settlement\u2019 presented to the Butlers on February 6, 2008, although substantially similar to the September 29, 1999 statement, contained two modifications. The lines designating \u2018Insurance Company\u2019 and the \u2018Personal Injury Claim\u2019 were purposefully omitted by the Respondent from the \u2018Statement of Settlement.\u2019 The Statement indicated that the Respondent earned and received $4,000 in attorney\u2019s fees and $41.65 in expenses, and that $1,828.92 was deducted from the \u2018Client\u2019s Net Proceeds\u2019 for medical expenses and $375 was deducted for \u2018Gary Butler\u2019 for his loss of consortium claim, for a balance of $3,753.43 to Mrs. Butler.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">\u201cAfter consultation and consent from Mr. and Mrs. Butler, the Respondent attempted to reduce Mrs. Butler\u2019s medical expenses. On May 9, 2003 and August 14, 2003, the Respondent sent letters to Metro Orthopedics &amp; Sports Therapy (hereinafter \u2018Metro Orthopedics\u2019) requesting a reduction of its invoice because \u2018[ujnder the terms of settlement, offered by the third party, Ms. Butler will receive virtually no compensation for her injuries if the subject invoice is not reduced.\u2019 In all, Mrs. Butler\u2019s outstanding medical bills of $1,828.92 were reduced by $160 of which 66 2/3% of this amount was paid to the Butlers.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">\u201cMrs. Butler testified at the hearing in this case on December 8, 2004 that she believed that, based on the \u2018Statement of Settlement,\u2019 her case was still viable and that her ease had settled with Arnica and the check she received in the amount of $3,753.43 was originally from Arnica. Nevertheless, Mrs. Butler, even after being apprised of the situation, stated she was satisfied with the services the Respondent provided and that she would retain her to perform legal services in the future, if needed.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>\u201cAfter investigating the matter, the Attorney Grievance Commission through Bar Counsel filed a Petition for Disciplinary Action against Respondent. This Court discovered at the hearing on December 8, 2004 that this matter was brought to the attention of the Attorney Grievance Commission through a Complaint filed by Arnica Mutual Insurance Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\">IV. Conclusions of Law</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">\u201cRespondent, without disputing the material facts of the case, testified that she (1) did not recognize the error made by the Clerk\u2019s Office until after the Statute of Limitations had expired on the Butlers Complaint; (2) did notify Arnica\u2019s attorney, Timothy Howie, to close his file on the Butlers Claim and then without consulting with the Butlers entered into a Joint Line of Dismissal with Prejudice on their claim; (3) did not notify the Butlers that the Statute of Limitations had expired and that they no longer had a viable claim; (4) presented the Butlers with a \u2018Statement of Settlement\u2019 and a settlement check paid out of her own funds; and (5) sent a letter to Metro Orthopedics that represented that there was a settlement in Mrs. Butler\u2019s claim in an effort to reduce her medical bills. Therefore, the factual predicate for this Petition is established by clear and convincing evidence. The specific violations of the Maryland Lawyer\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct alleged are addressed below.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">A. Rule 1.1 Competence</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">\u201cPetitioner complains that the Respondent was incompetent in ensuring that the Butler Complaint was independently filed and docketed with the Court. Petitioner avers that thoroughness and preparation are necessary in order to competently represent a client and that proper management of case files is included in that requirement. Furthermore, Petitioner contends that the Respondent should have had a proper system in place to process client matters and management of her files, including assuring the proper filing of Complaints. The Petitioner suggests that, if such a system <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>were in place, the Respondent would have realized that the parties recorded by the Clerk\u2019s Office in the Butler Complaint did not correlate with that in the actual Complaint itself. She would also have discovered on her own that the Butler Complaint was never properly filed and docketed by the Clerk\u2019s Office. In addition, Respondent would have been aware that the check her office issued to the Clerk of the Court for the filing fee of the Butler Complaint was not negotiated. If Respondent had noticed these irregularities, she might have clarified the record of the filing of the Butler Complaint prior to the expiration of the applicable Statute of Limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">\u201cRespondent argues that the clerical error by the Clerk of the Circuit Court was not a legal mistake by the Respondent and that there is no evidence in the record that would suggest that a minor personal injury case was beyond the competency level of the Respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">\u201cThis Court agrees with the Respondent on that limited point. Rule 1.1, however, is not limited in scope to legal knowledge and skill. Specifically, Rule 1.1 provides that \u2018[cjompetent representation requires the legal knowledge, skill, thoroughness and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation.\u2019 (Emphasis added). \u2018[W]hether the representation the lawyer gives is incompetent or is merely careless or negligent depends upon what reasonably is necessary in the circumstances, <em>ie., </em>the facts and circumstances of the particular case.\u2019 <em>Attorney Grievance Commission of Maryland v. Kemp, </em>335 Md. 1, 10, 641 A.2d 510, 514 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">\u201cThis Court finds in this case that, if the Petitioner had maintained an appropriately efficient and reliable system to process her client\u2019s matter and manage her case files, the Clerk\u2019s Office error would have been discovered prior to the Statute of Limitations expiring. The failure of the Respondent to notice that the Butler Complaint and the Brown Complaint were assigned the same case number and that the check from the Butler Complaint was not negotiated by the Clerk\u2019s Office was a result of not having such a system <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>in place in her office, not merely negligent or careless oversight in this particular case. \u2018[T]he thoroughness and preparation reasonably necessary for competent representation includes the proper management of case files.\u2019 <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Ober, </em>350 Md. 616, 630, 714 A.2d 856, 863 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">\u201cTherefore, this Court concludes that the Petitioner established by clear and convincing evidence that Respondent exhibited incompetence in handling the Butlers\u2019 case.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">B. 1.2 Scope of Representation</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">\u201cRule 1.2 provides that \u2018[a] lawyer shall abide by a client\u2019s decisions concerning the objectives of representation, ... and, when appropriate, shall consult with the client as to the means by which they are to be pursued. The lawyer shall abide by a client\u2019s decision whether to accept an offer of settlement of a matter.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b607-8\">\u201cInitially, the Respondent was given a clear directive by the Butlers to seek not less than $10,000.00 as settlement of their claims. Ms. Pennington pursued this amount during the negotiations with Arnica both before and after the filing of the Butler Complaint. Despite the Respondent\u2019s efforts, the nature of the Butlers claim changed after the Clerk\u2019s Office error was discovered, the Statute of Limitations had run on their claim, and the dismissal of their claim without consultation or consent of the Butlers. At this point, the Petitioner is correct in contending that the personal injury claimed changed to a possible malpractice claim against the Respondent. Mrs. Butler testified and Respondent agrees that settlement for $10,000.00 was to be with Arnica. The Butlers were never provided the necessary information to leap to the conclusion that they would have settled with the Respondent in a malpractice suit for the same amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-9\">\u201cThe Respondent did not and could not rely on the Butlers\u2019 decision to accept an offer of settlement for $10,000.00 as a means of \u2018making her clients whole\u2019 because there was no settlement offer to be accepted. The Butlers clearly did not give the Respondent the authority to settle a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>possible malpractice claim against her because they were not alerted to the facts that would give rise to such a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">\u201cFor these reasons, this Court concludes that Petitioner established by clear and convincing evidence, that Respondent violated this Rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">C. Rule 1.3 Diligence</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">\u201cThe Petitioner contends that the Respondent was not diligent in her representation of the Butlers because of her failure to assure proper filing of the Butlers\u2019 Complaint. The Respondent argues that the only lack of diligence is the failure to discover the lack of diligence of the employee of the Clerk\u2019s Office in carrying out his or her appointed duties. Further, the Respondent argues that at most the failure to make this discovery can be characterized as negligent or careless.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">\u201cRule 1.3 requires the lawyer to \u2018act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client.\u2019 This Court finds that the failure to discover the error made by the Clerk\u2019s Office was in fact a violation of Rule 1.3. It is the responsibility of the attorney to ensure that the Complaints they file on behalf of the client are filed properly. <em>See Attorney Grievance Commission v. Granger, </em>374 Md. 438, 823 A.2d 611 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-8\">\u201cIn this matter, Mrs. Butler suffered medical conditions that required that settlement negotiations be delayed until a determination was made as to whether or not those medical conditions were the result of the motor vehicle accident that Mrs. Butler was involved. However, once suit was filed the Respondent was aware of the fact that the Statute of Limitations would soon be expiring. The Respondent had an affirmative duty to ensure that the Complaint was properly filed and docketed and not allow the Statute of Limitations to expire on their claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-9\">\u201cThus, the Petitioner has proven through clear and convincing evidence that the Respondent violated this Rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>D. Rule 1.4 Communication</p>\n<p id=\"b609-4\">\u201cThere appears to be no dispute that the Respondent violated Rule 1.4(a). The facts clearly indicate the Respondent did not disclose to her clients the error made by the Clerk\u2019s Office, that their case was dismissed with prejudice after the Statute of Limitations had expired, and that they no longer had a viable personal injury claim. These undisputed facts alone provide clear and convincing evidence to this Court that Respondent violated Rule 1.4(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">\u201cHowever, there is a dispute as to whether the Respondent violated Rule 1.4(b). The Respondent contends that, because the Butlers had stated that they would be satisfied to settle their claim for $10,000.00, no additional information was ethically required to be imparted to the Butlers to allow them to make informed decisions regarding the settlement. This Court disagrees. The Butlers did not know the circumstances surrounding their case or the source of the purported \u2018settlement\u2019 checks. The Butlers assumed that the settlement checks were from Arnica. The Respondent never disclosed the actual source of the funds or the true circumstances and status of their case after it was dismissed with prejudice. The proper course of action would have been for the Respondent to disclose to the Butlers the status of their case and advise them to seek independent counsel. Only in this situation would the Butlers have been reasonably informed to make an informed decision in this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">\u201cThis Court therefore concludes by clear and convincing evidence that both provisions of Rule 1.4 were violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">E. Rule 1. 7(b) Conflict of Interest: General Rule</p>\n<p id=\"b609-8\">\u201cA conflict of interest arises when the economic interests of a lawyer are at odds with those of the client. <em>See Attorney Grievance Commission v. Roberson, </em>373 Md. 328, 818 A.2d 1059 (2003). The Respondent provides, by way of example in her brief, the most obvious situation where a' lawyer purports to represent both sides in a dispute. While this is the most obvious and probably the most common, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>does not present a complete picture of the conflicted relationships the Rule addresses. <em>See Rule 1.7 Comments.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">\u201cThe initial engagement of the Respondent by the Butlers did not present a conflict of interest. However, an economic conflict of interest between the Respondent and the Butlers arose as soon as the Butlers\u2019 Complaint was dismissed with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">\u201cThe Respondent argues that a conflict occurs when an event is economically detrimental to a client is economically beneficial to the lawyer. That is correct and this case provides an illustration of such a situation. The Butlers were injured because their lawyer never provided them the information necessary to determine if they wanted to accept a settlement offer from the Respondent or pursue their claim against her through a legal malpractice action. The Respondent was benefitted economically because she avoided the costs and expenses of defending a possible malpractice claim that was available to the Butlers.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">\u201cDespite the Respondent\u2019s failure to acknowledge a possible malpractice claim, the fact remains that, once the Joint Dismissal was filed in this case, the malpractice claim became a reality. The Respondent\u2019s successful attempt to placate the Butlers by providing what appeared to be a gross recovery of $10,000.00 from her own personal funds is not sufficient to eliminate, or even mitigate, the conflict. This cannot represent the amount that would have been recovered in a malpractice claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">\u201cThe Respondent further argues that, because the Butlers received what they anticipated, there was no injury. The fact remains that the Butlers were deprived of the potential malpractice claim and that, in this Court\u2019s view, is a substantial injury to the client. <em>See Graves v. State of Maryland, </em>94 Md.App. 649, 619 A.2d 123 (1991[1993]).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-8\">\u201cThe Respondent\u2019s argument is further without merit because even if she did not believe a conflict of interest existed, under the Rule she had an affirmative duty to disclose the facts to the client, advise them of their right to seek independent counsel, and obtain a consent before rep-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>reservation of the clients could proceed any further. There is no evidence in the record that reflects that these mandates of the Rule were followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-4\">\u201cThis Court concludes that there is clear and convincing evidence that there was a violation of Rule 1.7.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">F. Rule 1.16(a)(1)</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">\u201cThis Rule merely provides that \u2018a lawyer shall not represent a client or, where representation has commenced, shall withdraw from the representation of a client if the representation will result in violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct or other law.\u2019 For the reasons previously stated, Respondent clearly violated this Rule because she failed to withdraw from representation of the Butlers after her representation gave rise to their cause of action against her.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">G. Rule 8.4 Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">\u201cThe Petitioner complains that the Respondent has violated Rule 8.4(c) and 8.4(d). Respectively, these provisions find that a lawyer engages in professional misconduct if a lawyer: \u2018engage[s] in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation\u2019 and \u2018engage[s] in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b611-9\">\u201cThe Petitioner alleges that the Respondent, in an attempt to make it appear like the purported \u2018settlement\u2019 checks were from Arnica, prepared and presented a \u2018Statement of Settlement\u2019 that was almost identical to the Statement of Settlement presented to them back in 1999 for the settlement of their property damage claim. This, the Petitioner adds, is a perfect example of an overt act designed to mislead the clients.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-10\">\u201cIt is undisputed that the Respondent never disclosed the facts surrounding the dismissal of the case to the Butlers, that the Respondent never communicated to them the source of the funds used to \u2018make them whole\u2019 and, in addition, that the Respondent negotiated a reduction of Mrs. Butler\u2019s medical expenses by representing to certain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>health care providers that there was a possible settlement in this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">\u201cThe Respondent contends that her actions were not intentional or willful and thus could not been viewed to violate Rule 8.4(c) and (d). This Court simply does not believe that Respondent did not intend the natural consequences of her action and nonaction, especially when the Respondent testified that she never wanted the Butlers to become aware of the source of the funds or the status of their claims. Intentional fraud can be sustained by means of concealment. <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Clements, 3</em>19 Md. 289, 572 A.2d 174 (1990); <em>See also Attorney Grievance Commission v. Pinkney, </em>311 Md. 137, 532 A.2d 1367 (1987) (Respondent prepared fictitious pleadings to give her client the impression that her case was filed in court, when in fact, she had failed to do so.) The act of concealment is exactly the conduct of the Respondent in this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">\u201cThe Respondent argues an independent defense of reliance of counsel to not only the misconduct claims but also the conflict of interest claim. The Respondent consulted with Mr. Wiggins and was incorrectly advised by him that she could proceed with providing the Butlers $10,000.00 from her own funds without disclosing to the Butlers the source of the funds or the circumstances of their distribution. To support this contention, the Respondent relies on the following cases: <em>United States v. Peterson, </em>101 F.3d 375, 381 n. 4 (5th Cir.1996) and <em>Manown v. Adams, </em>89 Md.App. 503, 514, 598 A.2d 821, 826 (1991). However, reliance on these cases is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">\u201cIn <em>Peterson, </em>the Court clearly held that \u2018good faith reliance on counsel is not a defense to securities fraud. It is simply a means of demonstrating good faith and represents possible evidence of an absence of any intent to defraud.\u2019 101 F.3d at 382.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">\u201cIn <em>Adams, </em>the Court specifically states that \u2018[i]t is true that reliance on an attorney\u2019s advice may, in a civil action, negate wrongdoing where the advice has been based on full <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>disclosure of the relevant facts.\u2019 78[89] Md.App. at 514, 598 A.2d at 826 citing <em>Derby v. Jenkins, </em>32 Md.App. 386, 391, 363 A.2d 967 (1967[1976]). The Court continues, however, that \u2018[t]his rule allows lay people to rely on an attorney\u2019s ability to \u201cview the facts calmly and. dispassionately\u201d and to \u201cjudge the facts in their legal bearings.\u201d \u2018 (Emphasis added). <em>Adams </em>at 78[89] Md.App. at 514, 598 A.2d at 826 (citing <em>Derby v. Jenkins, </em>32 Md.App. 386, 391, 363 A.2d 967 (1967[1976])). It is clear that in these cases the Court was not presented with a situation where an attorney relied on the advice of counsel and that these cases do not deal with disciplinary actions. Furthermore, the bar is set higher for an attorney then a layperson.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-4\">\u201cAttorneys admitted to practice in the state of Maryland are \u2018deemed to know the Rules of Professional Conduct and have the obligation to act in conformity with those standards as a requirement to practice law.\u2019 <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Stein, </em>373 Md. 531, 543-544, 819 A.2d 372, 379 (2003) (citing <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Jeter, </em>365 Md. 279, 292, 778 A.2d 390, 397 (2001)).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">\u201cThis Court could find no Maryland case law in which good faith reliance on advice of counsel was an affirmative defense in a disciplinary action. However, the Court of Appeals has rejected the defense of a respondent\u2019s claim of reliance on the advice of an ethics opinion or a certified public accountant. <em>See Attorney Grievance Commission v. Gregory, </em>311 Md. 522, 536 A.2d 646, 651 (1988); <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Gavin, </em>350 Md. 176, 711 A.2d 193, 202 (1998). As such, the Respondent, in this Court\u2019s opinion cannot rely on the good faith reliance on the defense of counsel as this is not the rule in Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">\u201cSome jurisdictions have affirmatively held that the good faith reliance on the advice of counsel is never defense in a disciplinary action. <em>See People v. Katz, </em>58 P.3d 1176, 1187 (Co[lo].2002) (\u2018It is the individual attorney\u2019s duty and obligation to comply with Rules of Professional Conduct. The attorney may not delegate that duty or responsibility to another under the umbrella of advice of counsel and thereby <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>create a defense to a violation of those rules.\u2019); <em>Conduct of Gatti, </em>330 Or. 517, 526, 8 P.3d 966, 972-973 (Or.2000) (\u2018advice from disciplinary counsel is a not a defense to a disciplinary violation.\u2019)</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">\u201cFurthermore, the Respondent\u2019s argument is further negated since the advice relied upon was from Mr. Wiggins, an attorney with no familiarity with the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct and who is not admitted to practice law in Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">\u201cFinally, the Respondent contends that even if good faith reliance on the advice of counsel is not a complete defense, then it should stand as a mitigating factor. The factors recognized by Maryland Courts as mitigating circumstances in disciplinary matters are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-6\">\u2018absence of a prior disciplinary record; absence of a dishonest or selfish motive; personal or emotional problems; timely good faith efforts to make restitution or to rectify consequences of misconduct; full and free disclosure to disciplinary board or cooperative attitude toward proceedings; inexperience in the practice of law; character or reputation; physical or mental disability or impairment; delay in disciplinary proceedings; interim rehabilitation; imposition of other penalties or sanctions; remorse; and finally, remoteness of prior offenses.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A7H\"><em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Thompson, </em>367 Md. 315, 330, 786 A.2d 763, 772-73 (2001) (quoting <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Jaseb, </em>364 Md. 464, 481-82, 773 A.2d 516, 526 (2001) (in turn quoting <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Glenn, </em>341 Md. 448, 488-89, 671 A.2d 463, 483 (1996) (citations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">\u201cIt is the province of this Court to \u2018make findings in regards to facts that it believes mitigate in respect to the conduct of a respondent in attorney discipline .matters.\u2019 <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Vanderlinde, </em>364 Md. 376, 384, 773 A.2d 463, 467 (2001). Moreover, this Court \u2018is to bring what it believes to be mitigating circumstances, in respect to the conduct involved, to the attention of [The Court of Appeals], not to offer its views as to whether any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>such circumstance, or the lack of any such circumstances, justifies any lesser or greater sanction.\u2019 <em>Vanderlinde, </em>364 Md. at 384, 773 A.2d at 467. In discharging this responsibility, this Court brings to the attention of the Court of Appeals its finding that the Respondent in good faith relied on the incorrect advice provided to her by Mr. Wiggins and, because of that reliance, did not impart to the Butlers information about the status of their claims or the source of the funds that they received. Furthermore, during the hearing, Respondent displayed a high degree of remorse for her actions. These actions should therefore be considered as mitigating factors when fashioning any sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-4\">\u201cThis Court concludes that clear and convincing evidence was presented that the Respondent violated this Rule 8.4(c) and (d). Furthermore, the Respondent has failed to show by a preponderance of the evidence that good faith reliance on the advice of counsel is an affirmative defense to the claims of misconduct and conflict of interest. This Court does conclude that the good faith reliance on advice of counsel as a mitigating factor was sufficiently proven by the preponderance of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">V. Summary</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">\u201cRespondent violated seven separate Rules of Professional Conduct. Each of these violations compounded a situation resulting from the Respondent\u2019s failure to notice an error made by the Clerk\u2019s Office for Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County. Nothing in this proceeding evidenced Respondent\u2019s lack of knowledge or understanding of the law, or her inability to represent clients competently.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">\u201cRespondent has practiced alone for a considerable period of time. While the Court of Appeals must determine whether and to what extent the Respondent is deserving of discipline, your Chancellor respectfully suggests that a suspension of 120 days and a probationary period under the tutelage of a capable lawyer with strong administrative skills would prove beneficial to the Respondent and her future clients.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b616-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">Both parties have filed exceptions to the findings and conclusion of the hearing judge. The hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact are <em>prima facie </em>correct and will not be disturbed unless clearly erroneous. <em>Attorney Grievance v. Ellison, </em>384 Md. 688, 707, 867 A.2d 259, 270 (2005). When the findings are not clearly erroneous, exceptions will be overruled. <em>Id. </em>Our review is <em>de novo </em>as to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions of law. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">A. Respondent\u2019s Exceptions</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">The Circuit Court found that respondent violated Rules 1.1 Competence, 1.2(a) Scope of Representation, 1.3 Diligence, 1.4 Communication, 1.7(b) Conflict of Interest, 1.16(a)(1) Withdrawal from Representation and 8.4(c) and (d) Misconduct. Respondent excepts to these findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">Respondent\u2019s overarching defense before this Court, and underlying the most serious of her exceptions, is that she relied on the advice of counsel and that all charges should be dismissed. The hearing judge, noting that this Court has not addressed the applicability in attorney disciplinary proceedings of the affirmative defense of reliance on advice of counsel, began with the black letter proposition that all attorneys admitted to practice in Maryland are presumed to know the law, and concluded that such a defense is not available to an attorney in disciplinary actions. Determining that Maryland law does not allow for an affirmative defense of reliance on advice of counsel in attorney discipline matters, the hearing judge also found that respondent could not rely on the defense because the advice she relied upon was from \u201can attorney with no familiarity with the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct and who is not admitted to practice law in Maryland.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b616-8\">The closest this Court has come to addressing reliance on advice of counsel as a defense in an attorney grievance case is in <em>Attorney Griev. Com\u2019n v. Gregory, </em>311 Md. 522, 536 A.2d 646 (1988), where the attorney argued that his misconduct should be excused because he acted in reliance upon a formal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>ethics opinion of the Committee on Ethics of the Maryland State Bar Association. Although this Court rejected Gregory\u2019s argument because he, in fact, was not relying upon an opinion that dealt with the circumstances of his misconduct, we went further and stated \u201cthat an opinion of the Ethics Committee of the Bar Association is advisory, and is not binding on this Court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 531-32, 536 A.2d at 651. We stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-4\">\u201cAs a practical matter, however, where an attorney can demonstrate reasonable reliance upon an ethics opinion on point, that fact is likely to have a significant effect on the initial decision of the Attorney Grievance Commission concerning the filing of a complaint, as well as upon the determination or disposition of those charges that may be filed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b617-5\"><em>Id. </em>Finally, we pointed out that this general principle may be modified by rule or statute, as is the case with Md. Rule 1231 creating a Judicial Ethics Committee, now encompassed within Md. Rule 16-813, which provides protection to a judge who complies with an opinion issued by that committee. <em>Id. </em>at 531 n. 6, 536 A.2d at 651 n. 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">Maryland law does recognize the defense of reliance on the advice of counsel in some cases. <em>See, e.g., Brashears v. Collison, </em>207 Md. 339, 349-51, 115 A.2d 289, 294-95 (1955). Relying on <em>Brashears, </em>the Court of Special Appeals, in <em>VF Corp. v. Wrexham Aviation, </em>112 Md.App. 703, 686 A.2d 647 (1996), <em>aff'd in part and rev\u2019d in part, </em>350 Md. 693, 715 A.2d 188, held that reliance on advice of counsel is a defense in a fraud case as it bears on scienter. <em>VF Corp., </em>112 Md.App. at 716, 686 A.2d at 654. \u201cScienter is the intent to defraud or deceive.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 715, 686 A.2d at 653. Writing for the unanimous panel, Chief Judge Robert Murphy, later Chief Judge of this Court, stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-7\">\u201cTo prevail on an advice of counsel defense, however, appellants were required to persuade the jury (1) that they communicated to counsel all facts they knew or reasonably should have known; and (2) that they relied in good faith upon the advice given.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b618-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 716, 686 A.2d at 654; <em>see also United States v. Butler, 211 </em>F.3d 826, 833 (4th Cir.2000). Common expressions of the necessary elements to establish an advice of counsel defense have fleshed out the requirements stated by the <em>VF Corp. </em>court as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-4\">\u201cTo establish the advice-of-counsel defense, the party raising it must show that: (1) he is acting in good faith in the belief that he has good cause for his action and is not seeking an opinion in order to shelter himself; (2) he has made a full and honest disclosure of all the material facts within his knowledge or belief; (3) he is doubtful of his legal rights; (4) he has reason to know that his counsel is ' competent; (5) he honestly complied with his counsel\u2019s advice; and (6) his counsel is of such training and experience that he is able to exercise prudent judgment in such matters.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b618-5\"><em>G.S. Enterprises, Inc. v. Falmouth Marine, Inc., </em>410 Mass. 262, 571 N.E.2d 1363, 1371 (1991); <em>see also Liss v. United States, </em>915 F.2d 287, 291 (7th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">The affirmative defense of reliance on the advice of counsel arises most commonly in tax cases and in cases which require specific intent. Many courts have held that the defense is <em>only </em>available as against specific intent crimes. <em>See e.g., United States v. Cross, </em>113 F.Supp.2d 1253, 1264 (S.D.Ind.2000) (holding that advice of counsel is no defense to the general intent crime of operating an illegal gambling business because the defendant\u2019s specific intent or knowledge was not an essential element of crime); <em>United States v. Dyer, </em>750 F.Supp. 1278, 1293 (E.D.Va.1990) (stating that \u201c[i]n general, an advice of counsel defense applies only where the violation requires proof of specific intent, that is, proof that a defendant has actual knowledge that his conduct is illegal\u201d); <em>United States v. Soares, </em>998 F.2d 671 (9th Cir.1993) (affirming the district court\u2019s decision that an offense under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1954 was not a specific intent crime and, therefore, the defendant could not offer an advice of counsel defense); <em>United States v. Carr, </em>740 F.2d 339, 346 n. 11 (5th Cir.1984) (stating that \u201c[sjtrictly speaking, good faith reliance on advice of counsel is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>not really a defense to an allegation of fraud but is the basis for a jury instruction on whether or not the defendant possessed the requisite specific intent\u201d). The reason given as underlying this limitation is that the defense is deemed relevant to negate proof of a defendant\u2019s intent to violate the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\">The defense of reliance on advice of counsel was raised by an attorney in a disciplinary matter in Colorado. <em>See People v. Katz, 58 </em>P.3d 1176 (Colo.2002). The attorney was charged with violating Colo. R. Prof. Conduct 8.4(c), based on allegations that he withdrew money from a joint account without the knowledge or consent of the firm with whom he collaborated. Katz argued, <em>inter alia, </em>that he relied on the advice of counsel that he could withdraw the funds in question, and that in so doing, he could not be held to have violated the Rules of Professional Conduct. <em>Id. </em>at 1187. Disbarring the errant attorney, the Colorado Supreme Court rejected his argument, on two grounds.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-5\">\u201cFirst, it is presumed that Katz \u2014 as an attorney himself\u2014 understands and will adhere to the Rules of Professional Conduct. It is the individual attorney\u2019s duty and obligation to comply with the Rules of Professional Conduct. The attorney may not delegate that duty or responsibility to another under the umbrella of advice of counsel and thereby create a defense to a violation of those Rules. Second, the facts of this case established that Katz withheld material information from Wollins during the discussion in which Katz contends the legal advice was provided. Absent full, fair and honest disclosure of all known relevant information concerning the issue, the advice of counsel defense is not available .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 1187 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">Respondent\u2019s reliance on advice of counsel from Mr. Wiggins, a lawyer not admitted to practice in the State of Maryland, is not a defense to her violations of Rule 8.4(c) and (d) Misconduct, or to Rule 1.7(b) Conflict of Interest, or, for that matter, any of her conduct in this case. As a member of the Bar of this State, respondent took an oath to comply with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>the Rules of Professional Conduct and to act in conformity with those standards. <em>See Attorney Grievance v. Stein, </em>373 Md. 531, 542, 819 A.2d 372, 379 (2003). The hearing judge found, by clear and convincing evidence, that she never disclosed the true facts of the dismissal to her clients, that she never communicated the source of the funds to her clients, and that she created and presented a settlement sheet to her clients that could only have created an impression by them that the case had settled. As the Colorado court stated well, an attorney may not delegate the responsibility to another under the umbrella of advice of counsel and thereby create a defense to a violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct. Every lawyer in this State should know that the misrepresentation to the client that occurred in this case was a violation of the Rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">Moreover, even if the defense were applicable generally to attorney discipline matters, respondent\u2019s attempt to raise the defense would fail. First, misrepresentation under Rule 8.4(c) and conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice under (d) do not require specific intent. Second, respondent consulted a lawyer not admitted to practice law in this State, and, given her deceitful conduct, she could not have believed, in good faith, her conduct was proper. Finally, a predicate for establishing the defense is that the party asserting the defense establish that she has made a full and honest disclosure of all the material facts within her knowledge or belief. There is absolutely no evidence in this record, either from respondent or Mr. Wiggins, that respondent advised Mr. Wiggins that she intended to present a \u201cstatement of settlement\u201d form to the clients.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> As the hearing judge found, this form, similar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>to the one respondent used with this client in a prior case, clearly created an impression that the case was settled. This misrepresentation to the client is at the heart of respondent\u2019s misconduct, and there is no evidence that Mr. Wiggins approved this conduct. Moreover, even if he did, for the reasons we have stated, it would not be a defense to the Rule violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\">The argument underlying most of respondent\u2019s other exceptions is that the Butlers could not have filed a malpractice suit against her, and, therefore, she was not required to disclose to the Butlers the true nature of the \u201csettlement\u201d or to suggest that they retain independent counsel. Respondent argues that since the Butlers had determined their claims to be worth $10,000, the Butlers suffered no damage by her $10,000 \u201csettlement\u201d with them. This argument fails to consider that the Butlers\u2019 willingness to settle for $10,000 is not determinative of the value of their claims. Respondent, acting on the Butlers\u2019 behalf, sought a settlement of $20,000, rejected Arnica\u2019s $9,500 settlement offer, and filed a lawsuit seeking $100,000. Respondent could not determine the value of the Butlers\u2019 claims unilaterally. We overrule these exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>Respondent excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that her letter to Metro Orthopedics seeking a reduction of medical charges stated that the Butlers had accepted a settlement. She claims instead that the letter stated that the Butlers had received a settlement offer. We overrule this exception. Although respondent did not represent that the Butlers had accepted a settlement, this fact is beside the point. Respondent\u2019s letter was written after the Butlers\u2019 claim was dismissed, but she nonetheless referred to the settlement offer, and stated that a medical fee reduction \u201cwill facilitate an expeditious resolution of the subject third party claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">Respondent excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion of law that she had violated Rule 1.4(a). Respondent argues that her failure to disclose the clerk\u2019s error or the dismissal of the case was warranted because she feared that Mrs. Butler, a client with whom she had developed a friendship, would feel some remorse or discomfort in taking money from respondent. Respondent relies upon the term \u201creasonably informed\u201d in Rule 1.4, arguing that her decision not to disclose was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">The Comment to Rule 1.4 discusses the appropriateness of withholding information. The Comment states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AgG_\"><em>\u201cWithholding information. </em>\u2014 In some circumstances, a lawyer may be justified in delaying transmission of information when the client would be likely to react imprudently to an immediate communication. Thus, a lawyer might withhold a psychiatric diagnosis of a client when the examining psychiatrist indicates that disclosure would harm the client. A lawyer may not withhold information to serve the lawyer\u2019s own interest or convenience.... \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">Respondent did not merely <em>delay </em>disclosure to the Butlers. Instead, she executed a \u201csettlement\u201d with them and, according to her testimony, intended that they not learn of the dismissal of the suit. Moreover, the Comment makes clear that a lawyer may not withhold information to serve the lawyer\u2019s own interest. As the hearing judge found, respondent\u2019s failure to provide the Butlers with the information regarding the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>dismissal deprived them of the information necessary to determine if they wished to pursue a malpractice claim against her. Her conduct violated Rule 1.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\">Respondent presents several exceptions to the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact. Respondent excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s description of settlement negotiations with Arnica as basically correct but \u201ctoo terse to convey the full flavor of the history it addresses.\u201d We overrule this exception. The hearing judge is not required to set out all the facts in his findings and may select those deemed relevant and appropriate. <em>See Attorney Grievance v. Zdravkovich, </em>381 Md. 680, 694, 852 A.2d 82, 90 (2004) (quoting <em>Attorney Grievance v. Stolarz, </em>379 Md. 387, 398, 842 A.2d 42, 48 (2004), for the proposition that the \u201chearing judge as the trier of fact may elect to pick and choose which evidence to rely upon\u201d). Respondent excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s finding as to the timing of the filing of the complaint. We accept respondent\u2019s correction and find that the complaint was filed on August 12, 2002. Respondent excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s finding that she did not consult with the Butlers before seeking dismissal of their case with prejudice or advise them of her actions afterwards. Respondent represents that the Butler case was not dismissed with prejudice, but rather the complaint and all pleadings were returned to the parties and the line of dismissal was never acted upon. We overrule this exception. Respondent was asked repeatedly at the hearing about the \u201cline of dismissal,\u201d and she never controverted this fact. In fact, she authenticated petitioner\u2019s exhibit no.14 as the line of dismissal, and it was received into evidence without objection. The line of dismissal, signed by respondent, is entitled <em>\u201cLINE OF DISMISSAL WITH PREJUDICE </em>\u201d and asks the clerk to enter the claim as \u201cdismissed <em>WITH </em>prejudice.\u201d Respondent excepts to two findings related to respondent\u2019s decision to consult with Mr. Wiggins. The hearing judge\u2019s findings are not clearly erroneous and we overrule these exceptions. Respondent excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s finding that she purposefully omitted lines from the \u201cStatement of Settlement,\u201d arguing that she omitted those lines to avoid misleading the Butlers. The hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>judge\u2019s inferences drawn from the facts are not clearly erroneous, and we overrule the exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">Finally, respondent excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s findings that Mrs. Butler testified that she believed that her case was still viable, that her case had settled with Arnica, and that the check she originally received was from Arnica. We accept respondent\u2019s correction and find that Mrs. Butler did not testify to these statements. We note, however, that the hearing judge did not rely upon Mrs. Butler\u2019s beliefs in any of its conclusions of law. Rather, the hearing judge relied upon the undisputed facts that respondent did not disclose the facts surrounding the dismissal of the case or the source of the funds. Additionally, the hearing judge relied upon respondent\u2019s testimony that she intended for the Butlers to be unaware of the source of the funds and the status of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">We grant respondent\u2019s exception as to Rule 1.1 Competence, and Rule 1.3 Diligence. The record indicates that the parties stipulated that the statute of limitations had run on the client\u2019s complaint before respondent discovered the filing error. Based upon this stipulation, the Circuit Court found that \u201cif the Petitioner had maintained an appropriately efficient and reliable system to process her client\u2019s matter and manage her case files, the Clerks\u2019s Office error would have been discovered prior to the Statute of Limitations expiring,\u201d and thus, respondent exhibited incompetence in handling the Butlers\u2019 case. Respondent appears to have filed the complaint in the Butler case properly; it was the Clerk\u2019s Office error that resulted in the problem. Respondent\u2019s problem arose in her failure to detect that the check she gave to the Clerk\u2019s Office for the Butler complaint was not negotiated. While a better office system would have detected the problem, we do not think that such oversight or negligence constitutes sanctionable conduct under Rule 1.1. <em>See Attorney Grievance v. Thompson, </em>376 Md. 500, 512, 830 A.2d 474, 481 (2003) (stating that \u201ca single mistake does not necessarily result in a violation of Rule 1.1, and may constitute negligence but not misconduct under the rule\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>Respondent clearly violated Rule 1.4 Communication, Rule 1.7(b) Conflict of Interest, Rule 1.16(a)(1) Withdrawal from Representation, and Rule 8.4 Misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\">B. Petitioner\u2019s Exceptions</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">Bar Counsel excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that respondent\u2019s good faith reliance on advice of counsel as a mitigating factor had been proven by a preponderance of the evidence. Bar Counsel maintains that this conclusion is inconsistent with the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact and other conclusions of law. We disagree and overrule this exception. Judge Platt heard the witnesses testify and had the unique opportunity to assess their credibility. Although he rejected reliance on advice of counsel as an affirmative defense to whether the Rules of Professional Conduct had been violated, it is not necessarily inconsistent to find that respondent\u2019s contact with Mr. Wiggins was a mitigating factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">Bar Counsel also excepts to Judge Platt\u2019s conclusion that respondent displayed a high degree of remorse for her actions. At the hearing before the Circuit Court, respondent did not express remorse for her misrepresentations and deceitful conduct. Respondent testified during cross-examination that \u201cI am saying I did not want to mislead the clients in any way, shape, form or fashion.\u201d She also testified that \u201cI don\u2019t believe, Ms. [Bar Counsel], that I have told any untruths to the clients. So that\u2019s it.\u201d Her testimony constituted a continued denial of responsibility. She repeatedly denied any dishonesty. We agree with Bar Counsel and grant the exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">III. Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b625-8\">We turn now to the appropriate sanction. Bar Counsel maintains that respondent should be disbarred. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-9\">In fashioning the appropriate sanction to be imposed, we are guided by our interest in protecting the public and the public\u2019s confidence in the legal profession. <em>Attorney Grievance v. Powell, </em>369 Md. 462, 474, 800 A.2d 782, 789 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>(2002). As we have often stated, the purpose of attorney-disciplinary proceedings is not to punish the lawyer, but to protect the public as well as to deter other lawyers from engaging in similar misconduct. <em>Attorney Grievance v. Ellison, </em>384 Md. 688, 714, 867 A.2d 259, 274 (2005). The public is protected when sanctions are imposed that are commensurate with the nature and gravity of the violations and the intent with which they were committed. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">Although respondent violated Rules 1.2,1.4(a) and (b), 1.7(b), and 1.16(a)(1), it is the violations of Rules 8.4(c) and (d), and the conduct underlying those violations, that lead the Court to conclude that disbarment is the appropriate sanction. To reiterate, Rule 8.4(c) and (d) provide as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-5\">\u201cIt is professional misconduct for a lawyer to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-6\">* <em>X </em>*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-7\">(c) engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-9\">(d) engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-10\">Respondent\u2019s \u201cmisrepresentation[s]\u201d and \u201cdeceitful conduct\u201d in concealing the true account of how she mishandled the Butlers\u2019 claims, falsifying a supposed settlement of those claims with the insurer, intentionally misrepresenting matters in negotiations with third-party health care providers to reduce their charges to the Butlers, and concealing from the Butlers the facts that might have supported lodging a professional negligence claim against respondent, implicate the core responsibilities of truth and honesty expected of attorneys.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-11\">As Judge Battaglia wrote for the Court in <em>Attorney Grievance v. Angst, </em>369 Md. 404, 420, 800 A.2d 747, 757 (2002):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-12\">\u201cWe recently iterated the unparalleled importance of honesty in the practice of law:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-13\">\u201c \u2018Unlike matters relating to competency, diligence and the like, intentional dishonest conduct is closely entwined with the most important matters of basic character to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>such a degree as to make intentional dishonest conduct by a lawyer almost beyond excuse. Honesty and dishonesty are, or are not, present in an attorney\u2019s character.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-4\"><em>\u201cSee Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Lane, </em>367 Md. 633, 646, 790 A.2d 621, 628 (2002) (quoting <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Vanderlinde, </em>364 Md. 376, 418, 773 A.2d 463, 488 (2001)).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b627-5\"><em>Vanderlinde, </em>involving the intentional financial misappropriation genre of conduct violative of Rule 8.4(c), is a seminal case, in that it sought to return some measure of consistency to the analysis of sanctions in intentional dishonesty cases. After documenting the tortured and sometimes inexplicable \u201callover-the-ballpark\u201d array of sanctions in cases of attorney dishonesty that preceded it, 364 Md. at 389-413, 773 A.2d at 471-485, <em>Vanderlinde </em>endeavored to restore a principal, guiding star for the sanctions in such cases: \u201cDisbarment ordinarily should be the sanction for intentional dishonest conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 418, 773 A.2d at 488.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">Respondent was admitted to the Bar of this State in January, 1989. She has had one prior disciplinary action in which she received a reprimand for violation of Rule 1.8(e). <em>See Attorney Grievance v. Pennington, </em>355 Md. 61, 78, 733 A.2d 1029, 1038 (1999). Respondent offers little in the way of mitigation. As we have discussed, <em>supra, </em>respondent did not express remorse for her deceitful actions. Respondent\u2019s protestations of remorse ring hollow when placed next to her testimony, during cross-examination by Bar Counsel at the evidentiary hearing, that, \u201cI don\u2019t believe, Ms. [Bar Counsel], that I have told any untruths to the clients. So that\u2019s it.\u201d Likewise, regarding the obvious conflict of interest with her clients\u2019 interests, respondent testified at the evidentiary hearing: \u201cMs. [Bar Counsel], if you will help me to understand. I really don\u2019t understand your claim of conflict of interest.\u201d To the extent respondent expressed remorse, it is more in the nature of damage control than of sincere remorse.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">Any other evidence of mitigation in this case is also insufficient to justify a sanction less than disbarment. Respondent\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>attempt to purchase a plenary indulgence with her own money is more indicative of a selfish plan to conceal than of a praiseworthy desire to \u201cmake the client whole.\u201d Whether respondent acted to prevent her clients from knowing that they had a potential malpractice claim against her, or whether she acted out of a desire to spare her ill client further anguish, the profession is harmed when an attorney intentionally misrepresents matters to a client'and behaves in the manner as did respondent. Although respondent did seek advice from Mr. Wiggins, who, unfortunately, gave her incorrect advice<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>, her choice of Mr. Wiggins\u2019s counsel does little to mitigate the severity of her misdeeds. Her consultation with Mr. Wiggins, an attorney with offices in Washington, D.C., and who is not admitted in Maryland, smacks of a lack of good faith in seeking an objective and reliable ethics opinion, and seems rather to reflect a hope for ratification, from an uninformed, but friendly, source, of a course of conduct already selected.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Moreover, there is no evidence that she fully disclosed to him the proposed misrepresentations and deceit. Even had she done so, his \u201cblessing\u201d of the conduct could not be mitigating. As we have indicated, every lawyer is presumed to know and abide by the Rules of Professional Conduct. Disbarment of respondent is the appropriate sanction in order to protect the public and to inform other attorneys of the type of misconduct that will not be tolerated.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">\n<em>IT IS SO ORDERED; RESPONDENT SHALL PAY ALL COSTS AS TAXED BY THE CLERK OF THIS COURT, </em>\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>\n<em>INCLUDING COSTS OF ALL TRANSCRIPTS, PURSUANT TO MARYLAND RULE 16-715, FOR WHICH SUM JUDGMENT IS ENTERED IN FAVOR OF THE ATTORNEY GRIEVANCE COMMISSION AGAINST JILL JOHNSON PENNINGTON</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b598-12\">.

That I had filed suit in August of 1999. That I had learned from the insurance company that the suit was not accepted by the Clerk properly. That Mr. Butler had authorized or directed me to accept $10,000 to settle their respective claims. That the statute of limitations ran on September the 14th or 15th of [2002], <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>and that I had decided that I wanted to pay them. And I shared with him a little bit about why (unintelligible) ... And I told him about that after the statute had expired. And that I wanted to make her whole. I wanted to make them both whole.

And had done, had read a lot of the cases cited in those Rules. And concluded that there was absolutely no problem, whatsoever, with my giving Mrs. Butler and Mr. Butler the money. And that was my main issue. That was one of the major one, or at least equal ... And, two, that there was no reason, either, to disclose the source. That means that I was giving them the money.

In addition to the poor advice Mr. Wiggins gave to respondent regarding her plan to pay the clients from her own funds without disclosing the source, it appears to us that tire entire premise underlying respondent's actions, i.e., that the statute of limitations had expired before respondent realized that the complaint had been misfiled, is erroneous. The complaint <em>had </em>been timely filed; it was erroneously docketed by the Clerk's Office and as such, the statute of limitations may well have been tolled by the proper filing of the complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b628-6\">.

It also concluded that she did so intentionally, that the intent with which she acted was not a defense:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-5\">\u201cThe Respondent contends that her actions were not intentional or willful and thus could not been viewed to violate Rule 8.4(c) and (d). This Court simply does not believe that Respondent did not intend the natural consequences of her action and nonaction, especially when the Respondent testified that she never wanted the Butlers to become aware of the source of the funds or the status of their claims. Intentional fraud can be sustained by means of concealment. <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Clements, </em>319 Md. 289, 572 A.2d 174 (1990); See also <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Pinkney, </em>311 Md. 137, 532 A.2d 1367 (1987) (Respondent prepared fictitious pleadings to give her client the impression that her case was filed in court, when in fact, she had failed to do so.) The act of concealment is exactly the conduct of the Respondent in this matter.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">The court also rejected the \u201cindependent defense of reliance of counsel,\u201d which the respondent argued answered both the allegations with respect to Rule 8.4 and Rule 1.7. That defense was based on the respondent\u2019s having consulted with Mr. Wiggins concerning the appropriateness of proceeding to reimburse her client for a loss necessitated by her inaction, without fully disclosing to that client the circumstances and that it was her money, rather than that of an insurance company, that was being used to make the reimbursement. After conducting the analysis and reviewing the pertinent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>cases, the hearing court concluded, \u201cthe Respondent ... cannot rely on the good faith reliance on the defense of counsel as this is not the rule in Maryland.\u201d Nevertheless, it offered mitigating factors to be used when fashioning a sanction. Specifically, the hearing court made a \u201cfinding that the Respondent in good faith relied on the incorrect advice provided to her by Mr. Wiggins and, because of that reliance, did not impart to the Butlers information about the status of their claims or the source of the funds that they received.\u201d In addition, the hearing court noted that, \u201cduring the hearing, Respondent displayed a high degree of remorse for her actions. These actions should therefore be considered as mitigating factors when fashioning any sanction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b631-4\">Despite the Hearing court\u2019s mitigation findings and, notwithstanding its recognition of the purpose of attorney discipline, the majority orders the respondent disbarred.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">The goal of attorney discipline in this state is well settled and has been stated often: \u201cThe primary purpose in imposing discipline on an attorney for violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct is not to punish the lawyer but rather to protect the public and the public\u2019s confidence in the legal profession.\u201d <em>Attorney Griev.

Accordingly, I believe that an indefinite suspension, rather than disbarment, is the appropriate sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">That advice of counsel is not a defense or that the hearing court found that the respondent \u201cintend[ed] the natural consequences of her action and nonaction,\u201d does not mean that, as a matter of law, the respondent acted with a dishonest or selfish motive. As we have seen, the hearing court concluded that the respondent had no intent to harm her client.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">It necessarily follows, therefore, that she acted without a dishonest or selfish motive. That finding and conclusion is entitled to weight. That is true notwithstanding the facts that the hearing court could have reached the opposite conclusion and, more to the point, that that opposite conclusion is the one that this Court prefers and, as factfinder, would have reached. Nor can it be ignored that the hearing court concluded that the respondent expressed a high degree of remorse. Here again, that finding is entitled to weight. That the majority\u2019s review of the record leads it to the opposite finding does not undermine the finding and certainly is not a basis for its vitiation. When the hearing court\u2019s motive finding is considered with its finding of a high degree of remorse, disbarment simply is not warranted. There really is no good reason, and the public is not protected, when an attorney, acting, as found by the hearing court, without a selfish or dishonest motive is disbarred. Imposition of such a sanction under those circumstances, amounts to nothing more than punishment. Perhaps recognizing the logic of this position, the majority totally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>disregards the hearing court\u2019s motive findings <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and trivializes the remorse finding; in that way, the majority justifies its punishment \u2014 the exaction of the pound of flesh it believes required \u2014 of the respondent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b633-15\">. It is interesting to me, given the fact that the holding is that reliance on advice of counsel is not a defense, the emphasis that the majority places on where Mr. Wiggins is barred, going so far as to suggest that seeking advice from someone not barred in Maryland and, therefore, presumably, not familiar with Maryland procedure, somehow is more reprehensible, that her fault may have been less had she sought the advice of a Maryland attorney. Quaere: why do we refer frequently to commentators, experts, in many fields of endeavor, without regard to where they are barred? Curiously, sometimes, quite frequently, in fact, the opinion of the commentator finds its way into appellate opinions, even those of this Court. It is perhaps obvious, but I want to be clear, I do not share the majority\u2019s view.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
