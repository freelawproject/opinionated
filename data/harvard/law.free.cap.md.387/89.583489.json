After an evidentiary hearing on the allegations in the complaint, Lee was found by the hearing judge to have violated several rules of professional conduct. Lee argues in his exceptions to this Court that the fairness of his hearing was prejudiced because he was denied the ability to introduce, for the purpose of impeachment, the complainant\u2019s assertedly inconsistent statements made by her at the earlier Peer Review proceeding. Lee also argues that Bar Counsel presented testimony and made assertions during the evidentiary hearing that were demonstrably false. Although we shall deny to Lee the ability to utilize at the evidentiary hearing any statements made during the Peer Review proceeding, we remand this matter so that the hearing judge may consider the proffered additional evidence, as identified in Lee\u2019s exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">John Smith, the complainant\u2019s husband, was convicted in 1974 of two counts of first degree murder and two counts of arson after a trial by jury in the Circuit Court for Cecil County. On 6 December 1974, the trial court imposed two concurrent life sentences for the murder convictions. For the two arson convictions, Smith was sentenced to two, thirty year terms to run concurrently with each other, but consecutively to the life sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">On 12 April 1976, the Court of Special Appeals reversed one of Smith\u2019s arson convictions on double jeopardy grounds. <em>Smith v. State, </em>31 Md.App. 106, 113-16, 355 A.2d 527, 532-33 (1976). The other arson conviction was vacated on 5 October 1977 as the result of a successful petition for post-conviction relief filed by the Office of the State Public Defender. Evidence admitted at Lee\u2019s evidentiary hearing in the present disciplinary case indicated that, during the period from 1977 to immediately prior to Smith\u2019s wife\u2019s solicitation of Lee\u2019s services, John Smith filed several additional petitions for post-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>conviction relief relevant to the murder convictions. All were denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">At the evidentiary hearing on the charges in the present case, Lee testified that, because of his prior successes in securing post-conviction relief for a number of prisoners, he apparently became well known among the State\u2019s prison population as an attorney skilled in post-conviction matters. To assist him with an influx of additional post-conviction and other matters, Lee employed Lester V. Jones, a disbarred, former member of the Maryland Bar. Lee claimed that, although he deferred many of the research duties and other undertakings regarding John Smith\u2019s case to Jones, he supervised Jones\u2019s work and took steps to ensure that Jones did not engage in the unauthorized practice of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">Lee explained that John Smith began calling his office from the Western Correctional Institute in Cumberland, Maryland (\u201cWCI\u201d), sometime in January 2001, seeking Lee\u2019s advice and an assessment of Smith\u2019s hopes for release. On 3 March 2001, John Smith sent a cover letter and several pages of case documents to Lee\u2019s office in Harford County, addressed to Jones, seeking Jones\u2019s assessment of possible post-conviction relief.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The letter also requested Jones to inform John Smith of the cost, if he believed the case to be meritorious, of pursuing his matter in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">On 21 April 2001, Mary Smith met with Jones at Lee\u2019s office in Bel Air, Maryland, to discuss her husband\u2019s case. Mary Smith brought to this meeting a portion of the $3500 retainer quoted by Lee and a box of documents and transcripts related to all aspects of her husband\u2019s original trial and subsequent post-conviction proceedings. She testified at the evidentiary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>hearing in this case that she procured these papers from \u201cthe archives in Philadelphia.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Although Mary Smith initially testified that the box of documents contained \u201cthe entire transcript of the original trial and the post conviction,\u201d she later temporized that she was \u201cnot versed in the law\u201d and was unsure of which specific legal documents were in the box. Lee\u2019s view was that, although the box of documents contained several post-conviction transcripts, it did not contain transcripts of John Smith\u2019s original 1974 trial. Mary Smith eventually delivered the balance of Lee\u2019s retainer in June 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">On 28 November 2001, Jones wrote to Mary Smith, stating in his correspondence that a \u201cdraft Petition\u201d had been \u201cnearly completed,\u201d and that Jones would be forwarding the draft to both John and Mary Smith for their comment. Although Mary Smith testified that she received the 28 November 2001 letter, both she and her husband denied receiving the draft petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">Lee acknowledged that, during the period between 28 November 2001 and late April 2002, Mary and John Smith made several calls to his office inquiring as to the status of the case. By the end of April 2002, Lee maintained that he had concluded that another post-conviction petition would prove unsuccessful. Despite this conclusion, Lee testified that, in response to Mary Smith\u2019s concerns that Lee was not pursuing her husband\u2019s matter in a diligent manner, Lee sent letters to attorneys who had represented Smith and his co-defendant at their original trials in 1974 seeking the transcripts from those trials. Although these letters facially were copied to both John and Mary Smith, they denied receiving the copies. Lee was unsuccessful in obtaining the transcripts through the correspondence.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">Lee claimed that, at this point, he concluded that John Smith\u2019s best option for release from prison would be through the parole process. Then-Governor Parris N. Glendening, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>however, whose term of office would not end until January 2003, had an announced policy of refusing, under most circumstances, to consider the grant of parole for any inmate that was serving a life sentence. Aware of this \u201clife means life\u201d policy, Lee advised John Smith, by telephone, that his best hope for release was to wait until after the inauguration of the next governor in 2003 to request a parole hearing. Although Lee testified that he communicated to John Smith the existence and criteria of the Governor\u2019s \u201clife means life\u201d policy, Lee also testified that, in early 2002, against his advice, John Smith requested that Lee immediately seek a parole hearing. In response to this request, he sent a letter on 29 April 2002 to the Maryland Parole Commission requesting a parole hearing, which subsequently was scheduled for sometime in June 2002. Again, although Lee testified that this letter was copied to both John and Mary Smith, they testified that they never received this correspondence. On 30 May 2002, however, John Smith, acting on behalf of himself and without the knowledge of Lee, asked the parole hearing board to withdraw the request for a parole hearing.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">Lee claimed that, on 15 May 2002, he sent a letter to John Smith, copied to Mary Smith, in which he stated that, as a result of conversations between himself and John Smith, he would proceed with preparation and filing of a \u201cPetition for a Writ of Error.\u201d Bar Counsel presented evidence, however, that neither John nor Mary Smith received this correspondence, and both testified that they were never made aware of, or saw, any work product relating to a \u201cPetition for Writ of Error.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">Lee introduced evidence that, on 17 July 2002, Jones sent a letter to Mary Smith, copied to John Smith, in which Jones stated that his review of John Smith\u2019s materials and a discus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>sion with a fellow inmate of Smith led him to the conclusion that he was \u201ccomfortable ... that there was some avenue of relief for John ..., including but not limited to Motion to Correct Illegal Sentence, etc.\u201d Although Mary Smith admitted that she received this correspondence, Bar Counsel presented evidence that John Smith did not. Neither, however, testified that they received any work product related to the actions proposed in Jones\u2019s letter.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">Sometime in late 2002, Jones entered the hospital to undergo what Lee characterized as a \u201croutine operation.\u201d Although Lee expected Jones to return to his offices within a short period, Jones experienced serious complications from the surgery and did not return to Lee\u2019s office. Jones, however, remained in the employ of Lee during the remainder of 2002, working at home during his recuperation.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">During the period Jones was working from home, Lee.\u2019s secretary, Dolores Willis, would bring files to Jones\u2019s house for his review. In a memorandum to Lee, dated 11 December 2002, summarizing the status of every open file under Jones\u2019s supervision, Jones offered research and general remarks concerning John Smith\u2019s case. The memorandum contained a review of John Smith\u2019s criminal and -post-conviction history, and recommended that, based on the results of Jones\u2019s research, Lee should prepare a \u201cWrit of Review to Vacate Judgment.\u201d Jones\u2019s memorandum also advised Lee that then-Governor-elect Robert L. Ehrlich, Jr. indicated he would consider parole requests on a case-by-case basis (abandoning the \u201clife means life\u201d policy of Governor Glendening) and therefore Lee should consider pursuing a parole hearing request for John Smith following Governor-elect Ehrlich\u2019s inauguration.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>Jones\u2019s memorandum encouraged Lee to call Mary Smith so that she could be updated with the information in the memorandum. Mary Smith testified that she did not have any communication with Lee until she called Lee in late December 2002 to request a meeting to review the status of her husband\u2019s case. With Jones present, Lee met with Mary Smith on or about 9 January 2003. Mary Smith inquired as to the progress of Lee\u2019s research. Lee told Mary Smith that, in order to give her a complete answer to her inquiries, he would need a month to review the transcripts and other documents that she had delivered to his office in April 2001. Mary Smith agreed to Lee\u2019s request. Lee claimed that, in the days following their meeting, he spent 6.5 hours reviewing the transcripts.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">Approximately two or three weeks after Lee met with Mary Smith, Lee claimed that John Smith called Lee from WCI and left a message instructing him to cease work on his case and refund any unpaid portion of the retainer to Mary Smith. In response, Lee testified he stopped work. Ten days after Lee ceased work, Mary Smith called Lee and instructed him to ignore John Smith\u2019s message and resume work on her husband\u2019s case. Approximately two to three weeks after Mary Smith\u2019s call requesting him to resume work, according to Lee\u2019s testimony, Mary Smith called again, this time stating that \u201cshe wanted all her files back and she wanted her entire retainer back and if she didn\u2019t get it, she was going to cause problems.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">Contrary to Lee\u2019s version of events, Mary and John Smith testified that they had no knowledge of any telephone calls to Lee requesting him to stop or resume work. Although he placed approximately 188 collect telephone calls to Lee\u2019s office over the course of the relevant time period, John Smith <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>testified that he never once spoke directly with Lee, instead always being diverted to Jones. Lee claimed, however, that he had spoken with John Smith on several occasions and, although he may not have participated, he was present, listening on the office speakerphone, for several other conversations between Jones and John Smith.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">Mary Smith recalled that, after her meeting with Lee in early January, she made several unsuccessful attempts to contact Lee. Six weeks after the meeting, and with no response from Lee, she emailed Lee and requested a return of her $8500 retainer and her papers. On 4 March 2003, Lee responded via email, stating that he was in the process of reviewing the transcripts but that, if Mary Smith desired, he would cease work, return the transcripts, and refund any unearned portion of the retainer. Lee testified, however, that Mary Smith was unwilling to accept anything less than a refund of the full retainer. Lee also testified that, despite Mary Smith\u2019s representations to the contrary, the transcripts were available for her to pick up at her convenience. Mary Smith filed the present complaint, dated 21 April 2003, with the Attorney Grievance Commission (\u201cCommission\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">In her complaint, she accused Lee of being \u201ctotally unfamiliar\u201d with her husband\u2019s matter and failing to act diligently on her requests even though, for almost two years, according to her claims, Lee had all the written materials that he needed to pursue effectively a post-conviction petition. Mary Smith also accused Lee of failing to communicate effectively with her and her husband by either ignoring their requests for information or stringing them along by making unsubstantiated promises regarding the progress being made on John Smith\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">In his written response, dated 20 June 2003, to the Commission regarding the complaint, Lee characterized Mary Smith\u2019s assertions as springing more from a fee dispute than his failure of diligence or communication. In summarizing his office\u2019s research and progress on the Smith case, Lee made the following representations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>We attempted to secure transcripts of the proceedings in [the original trials of Smith and his co-defendant]; however, due to the many years since these cases were tried in the early 1970\u2019s, the transcripts were not available from either the Courts, the prosecuting attorneys, or the defense attorneys and Public Defenders. Mrs. Smith did eventually provide a box full of transcripts, pleadings, Memorandums of Law, and voluminous research materials that John Henry Smith had used in his many appeals and Petitions for Post Conviction Relief.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b129-4\">Lee also stated that \u201c[f]rom March, 2001 until September, 2002, there was much correspondence to and from my office regarding [John Smith\u2019s case].\u201d He explained, however, that once Jones entered the hospital there was not much progress made on the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">On 17 September 2003, Bar Counsel filed a Statement of Charges against Lee, advancing various violations of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct (\u201cMRPC\u201d). Pursuant to the Maryland Rules governing the attorney discipline process, a Peer Review Panel proceeding was held in late 2003 during which both Lee and Mary Smith gave in-person statements.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> When the Peer Review process failed to resolve the matter, the Commission, on 21 January 2004, directed Bar Counsel to file a Petition for Disciplinary Action against Lee. The petition was filed on 28 April 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">The Petition for Disciplinary Action alleged violations<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>MRPC 1.3<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> (diligence), MRPC 1.4<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> (communication), MRPC 1.5(a)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> (fees), MRPC 1.16(d)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> (declining or terminating representation), MRPC 8.1(a)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> (bar admission and disciplinary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>matters), and MRPC 8.4(b), (c), (d)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> (misconduct). In his answer to the petition, Lee denied any misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\">A two day evidentiary hearing was held before Judge Vicki Ballou-Watts of the Circuit Court for Baltimore County on 8 and 13 October 2004. After hearing testimony from Lee, Mary Smith, John Smith, an official from WCI, and Lee\u2019s secretary, the hearing judge issued her Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law on 29 November 2004. She found, by clear and convincing evidence, that Lee violated MRPC 1.3, 1.4(a), 8.1(a), and 8.4(c). Lee violated MRPC 1.3, she concluded, by failing to review personally Smith\u2019s case materials for nearly two years; failing to forward to his clients the results of any research or draft documents, as promised in various correspondence; failing to manage properly his workload; and, failing to meet with or speak to John and Mary Smith for nearly a two year period. The hearing judge concluded that Lee violated MRPC 1.4(a) by failing to respond to the Smiths\u2019 requests for information, both written and made by telephone; failing to forward the results of any research or draft documents, as promised in various correspondence; and, failing to respond to Mary Smith\u2019s repeated requests for the return of transcripts and papers for a period of three weeks. The judge also concluded that Lee \u201cviolated [MRPC] 8.1(a) and 8.4(c) when he misrepresented to the Attorney Grievance Commission that the cause for delay in pursuing the legal matter for which he was retained was due to the unavailability of tran<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>scripts.\u201d Judge Ballou-Watts, however, found no clear and convincing evidence to support a conclusion that Lee violated MRPC 1.5(a) and 1.16(d). Rather, she was persuaded by-Lee\u2019s client ledger to conclude that there was not sufficient evidence from which to find that no appreciable work had been performed. She stated that, although it was possible that Mary Smith may have been entitled to a refund of a portion of her retainer, there was insufficient evidence to accurately determine what portion of the fee was unearned.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">Lee filed several exceptions to the hearing judge\u2019s written Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, disputing several, if not most, of the factual findings. Lee also filed a Motion for Reconsideration Based on Fraud, Deceit and Misrepresentation, supported by alleged new evidence that was not introduced or considered at the evidentiary hearing, which he boldly alleged demonstrated that Bar Counsel deliberately had presented false testimony. Lee also argued that the hearing judge precluded him from impeaching Bar Counsel\u2019s witness, Mary Smith, by improperly preventing him from introducing evidence of statements reportedly made by her at the Peer Review Panel meeting that supposedly were inconsistent with some of her statements made at the evidentiary hearing. Although Bar Counsel filed a response to Lee\u2019s exceptions requesting that his exceptions be overruled, no exceptions were taken by bar counsel to the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact or conclusions of law. Bar Counsel seeks an indefinite suspension as the appropriate sanction for Lee\u2019s violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">Lee claims that he was denied improperly the opportunity to impeach Mary Smith\u2019s testimony by introducing statements made at the Peer Review Panel proceeding that were alleged to be inconsistent with certain statements she made at the evidentiary hearing.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> During his recross-examination of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>Mary Smith, Lee attempted to ask her about statements she allegedly made at the Peer Review Panel proceeding indicating that she had signed a written retainer agreement with him. Mary Smith stated at the evidentiary hearing that she did not recall signing or receiving a retainer agreement from Lee.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>A.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">The Peer Review process embodied in the current Maryland attorney grievance rules was fashioned in 2001 out of the ashes of the elimination of the former Inquiry Panel and Review Board procedures. Under the former rules, if Bar Counsel believed that a complaint against an attorney was meritorious, he or she would refer that complaint to an Inquiry Panel and give notice to the attorney of the nature of the complaint. Former Md. Rule 16\u2014706(a)(4) (2000). The Inquiry Panel hearing was a relatively formal investigatory tribunal in which three individuals, the majority of which were attorneys licensed to practice in Maryland, would hear testimony from witnesses, receive other evidence, and make formal findings of fact and recommendations as to whether a respondent attorney should be subject to disciplinary sanctions. <em>Id. </em>16\u2014706(d); 16-706(c). Although not strictly governed by the formal rules of evidence, the Inquiry Panels were governed by a procedural scheme similar to a civil trial, allowing witnesses to be subpoenaed, depositions to be taken, and testimony to be taken under oath and transcribed. <em>Id. </em>16\u2014706(d). If the Inquiry Panel determined that the respondent attorney committed misconduct, the panel could recommend that charges be filed against the respondent attorney. <em>Id. </em>16\u2014706(d)(4)(a). If the Inquiry Panel recommended that charges be filed, the panel was required to state, in writing, the basis for the charges and file those reasons, its recommendations, and any evidence utilized at the Inquiry Panel hearing with Bar Counsel, who would then transmit those findings to the Review Board and the respondent attorney. <em>Id. </em>16\u2014706(d)(4)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">The function of the Review Board would be to review the findings of the Inquiry Panel and either approve, modify, or reject the panel\u2019s recommendation, dismiss the complaint, or remand for further proceedings in front of the Inquiry Panel.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number><em>Id. </em>16-707. If the Review Board agreed with an Inquiry Panel\u2019s recommendation that charges be filed, Bar Counsel would then file charges in the Court of Appeals, on behalf of the Commission, against the respondent attorney. <em>Id. </em>16-709. The Court would then designate a hearing judge, who would hold an evidentiary hearing similar to the hearings held under the current rules. <em>Id. </em>16-710; Md. Rule 16-757.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">Under the former rules, the proceedings of the Inquiry Panel and the Review Board were not open to the public. Former Md. Rule 16-708. The rules provided that, with certain exceptions,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> the record of any complaint, investigation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>and proceeding of the Inquiry Panel or the Review Board would be private and confidential. <em>Id. </em>Once charges were filed in the Court of Appeals, however, that confidentiality did not extend to any further proceedings, which were open to the public. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">In 1999 the Court of Appeals began the comprehensive process of revisiting the Maryland rules governing attorney grievance matters in order to address concerns that the process was inefficient and contained certain redundancies. Many members of the legal and judicial communities harbored concerns that the effectiveness of the attorney grievance process was impeded by the relatively sizable lengths of time that often transpired between the initial filing of a complaint and the ultimate disposition by this Court. <em>See </em>144th Report of the Standing Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure: Hearings Before the Court of Appeals (9 Sept. 1999) (on file at the Court of Appeals). The main source of this delay, it was believed, was the duplicative and redundant nature of a process that included two administrative tiers of relatively formal findings of fact; one by an Inquiry Panel and the other from the evidentiary hearing in front of a circuit court judge. <em>Id. </em>In response to these concerns, the Court of Appeals, among other things, determined to eliminate the Inquiry Panel and Review Board and, in their place, create the Peer Review Panel process.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">The present attorney grievance process in place for the handling and resolution of the complaint against Lee, as under the former rules, begins when Bar Counsel receives a complaint and initiates an investigation of that complaint. Md. Rule 16-731. At the conclusion of the investigation, Bar Counsel may elect to make one of several recommendations to the Commission, including that the complaint be dismissed, that a Conditional Diversion Agreement<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> be executed be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>tween Bar Counsel and the respondent attorney, that the respondent attorney be reprimanded, or that the Commission file immediately a Petition for Disciplinary or Remedial Action. <em>Id. </em>16-734. Unlike under the former rules, however, if Bar Counsel determines the complaint to be meritorious, he or she may, in lieu of the other options referenced above, elect to file with the Commission a Statement of Charges,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> which then is served on the respondent attorney. <em>Id. </em>16-741; Former Rule 16-706(a)(4) (providing that, under the former rules, if Bar Counsel believed a complaint to be meritorious, he or she then would refer the complaint to an Inquiry Panel and give notice to the respondent attorney). The Statement of Charges is a document that alleges specifically any perceived violations of professional misconduct or incapacity and contains a fair summary of the evidence uncovered by Bar Counsel during its investigation. Md. Rules 16-701(m); 16-741. Within 30 days of the filing of a Statement of Charges, the Chair of the Peer Review Committee schedules a Peer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>Review Panel proceeding.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>16-742(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">Like the Inquiry Panel hearings, the Peer Review process features a panel of at least three individuals, comprised of a majority of attorneys and at least one member being a non-attorney,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> that makes a preliminary determination as to whether formal charges should be filed against the respondent attorney. <em>Id. </em>16-743. Unlike the relative formality of the Inquiry Panel hearing, however, the Peer Review Panel proceeding is an informal, nonadversarial meeting designed to allow Bar Counsel, the respondent attorney, the complainant, and other invited persons to meet and discuss the issues presented in the complaint in an environment similar to a mediation process. <em>Id. </em>16-743. The Peer Review Panel must \u201callow Bar Counsel, the [respondent] attorney, and each complainant to explain their positions and offer such supporting information as the Panel finds relevant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>16-743(c). The Panel may, but need not, hear from any other person upon the request of either Bar Counsel or the respondent. <em>Id. </em>The Panel is not governed by any formal rules of evidence, but must respect lawful privileges. <em>Id. </em>The meeting is not recorded or transcribed.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">The purpose of the Peer Review Panel is not principally to make recommendations as to the appropriateness of formal charges. The Committee Note to Md. Rule 16-743(a) provides a relatively complete description of the purpose of the Peer Review process:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>If a Peer Review Panel concludes that the complaint has a substantial basis indicating the need for some remedy, some behavioral or operational changes on the part of the lawyer, or some discipline short of suspension or disbarment, part of the peer review process can be an attempt through both evaluative and facilitative dialogue, (A) to effectuate directly or suggest a mechanism for effecting an amicable resolution of the existing dispute between the lawyer and the complainant, and (B) to encourage the lawyer to recognize any deficiencies on his or her part that led to the problem and take appropriate remedial steps to address those deficiencies. The goal, in this setting, is not to punish or stigmatize the lawyer or to create a fear that any admission of deficiency will result in substantial harm, but rather to create an ambience for a constructive solution. The objective views of two fellow lawyers and a lay person, expressed in the form of advice and opinion rather than in the form of adjudication, may assist the lawyer (and the complainant) to retreat from confrontational positions and look at the problem more realistically.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b139-4\">If, however, after hearing statements, the Panel determines that the Statement of Charges \u201chas a substantial basis and that there is reason to believe that the [respondent] attorney has committed professional misconduct or is incapacitated, the Panel may ... make an appropriate recommendation to the Commission or ... inform the parties of its determination and allow the attorney an opportunity to consider a reprimand or a Conditional Diversion Agreement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>16-743(c)(2). The Panel is authorized to recommend to the Commission that either a Petition for Disciplinary or Remedial Action be filed, the Statement of Charges be dismissed, or that a Conditional Diversion Agreement or reprimand is appropriate. <em>Id. </em>16-743(e). Although the purpose of the Panel proceeding is not to generate any formal findings of fact, the Panel must accompany its recommendation with \u201ca brief explanatory statement.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">Another major distinction between the Inquiry Panel hearing and the Peer Review Panel proceeding is the level of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>confidentiality that is imposed on the Peer Review Panel proceeding. Md. Rule 16-723(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-4\">(a) Confidentiality of peer review meetings. All persons present at a peer review meeting shall maintain the confidentiality of all speech, writing, and conduct made as part of the meeting and may not disclose or be compelled to disclose the speech, writing, or conduct in any judicial, administrative, or other proceeding. Speech, writing, or conduct that is confidential under this Rule is privileged and not subject to discovery, but information otherwise admissible or subject to discovery does not become inadmissible or protected from disclosure solely by reason of its use at the peer review meeting.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">This language was first proposed in a comprehensive revision to the rules governing attorney grievance matters drafted by a delegated two member working subcommittee of the Court comprised of Judge Alan M. Wilner and the author of this opinion. The subcommittee\u2019s draft revisions were delivered to the Court\u2019s Standing Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure (\u201cRules Committee\u201d) for its review and comments. At its 8 September 2000 meeting, the Rules Committee discussed two competing policies regarding the level of confidentiality that should apply to Peer Review proceedings. <em>See </em>Minutes of the Standing Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure, 15-18 (8 Sept. 2000). Some members of the Rules Committee expressed concerns that effectiveness and confidence in the process would be undermined if a respondent attorney could make false statements during the Peer Review Panel proceeding without facing any direct or indirect adverse consequences. <em>Id. </em>at 16-17. If a respondent attorney were to make false statements during the Peer Review proceedings, under this view, Bar Counsel would be unable to impeach a false statement later at the evidentiary hearing in front of a judge. To assuage this concern, it was suggested that the proposed rule governing confidentiality include a \u201cprior inconsistent statement\u201d exception that would allow a respondent attorney to be impeached at any subsequent formal evidentiary hearing through the use of statements made at the Peer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>Review proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at 17. This exception, however, was not included in the Rules Committee\u2019s ultimate recommendations to the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">The Rules Committee recommended instead that the confidentiality language proposed by the Court\u2019s subcommittee be adopted as part of the proposed rules. <em>Id. </em>at 18. Even though it interpreted the proposed confidentiality language to circumscribe Bar Counsel\u2019s ability to use a statement made during the Peer Review process for the purpose of impeaching a respondent attorney\u2019s testimony at a subsequent evidentiary hearing in the matter, the Rules Committee believed that complete confidentiality was essential to the overall purpose of the Peer Review process. <em>Id. </em>at 16-18. Establishing a Peer Review process that is informal and confidential would create, the Rules Committee reasoned, an environment in which a respondent attorney is encouraged to speak openly without the fear of direct exposure to potential disciplinary or other adverse consequences. <em>Id.; see </em>Committee Note to Rule 16-743(a) (stating that \u201c[t]he goal, in this setting, is not to punish or stigmatize the lawyer <em>or to create a fear that any admission of deficiency will result in substantial harm, </em>but rather to create an ambience for a constructive solution\u201d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">The recommendations of the Rules Committee were communicated back to the Court\u2019s subcommittee for its consideration. On 8 November 2000, the sub-committee presented its recommendations regarding the proposed revisions to the rules to the full Court. <em>See </em>144th Report of the Standing Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure: Hearings Before the Court of Appeals (8 Nov. 2000) (on file at the Court of Appeals). We stated that the confidentiality language in proposed Rule 16-723(a) reflected a \u201cpure policy issue\u201d favoring the complete -confidentiality of the Peer Review proceedings.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The Court\u2019s subcommittee was of the opinion that, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>order to encourage candor and openness in the Peer Review process, Bar Counsel should be precluded from using any statement made by a respondent attorney during the Peer Review process for impeachment purposes at any subsequent evidentiary hearing in the matter. The subcommittee stated that this strict confidentiality reflected not only an underlying policy judgment, but also the practical impact of the informal nature of the Peer Review proceedings. Because the Peer Review proceedings would not be recorded or transcribed, nor involve statements given under oath, the subcommittee concluded that' any attempt to prove what was said at those proceedings would be unnecessarily burdensome and potentially unreliable. The language in proposed Md. Rule 16-723(a) was approved by the full Court on 30 November 2000, and the new rules, including those governing the Peer Review process, became effective on 1 July 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">In the present case, Lee\u2019s exceptions and motion purport to raise the obverse of the specific concerns raised by the Court and the Rules Committee in considering and adopting Rule 16 \u2014 723(a); that is, whether a complainant\u2019s, rather than a respondent attorney\u2019s, statements made during the Peer Review process may be used to impeach a complainant\u2019s later testimony at the evidentiary hearing in the matter. Lee\u2019s issue nonetheless implicates the same policy concerns as those considered by the Court and the Rules Committee. We believe that the language of Rule 16-723(a) clearly indicates that all statements made at a Peer Review Panel proceeding, no matter who the declarant is, remain confidential and privileged and thus unavailable for use to impeach the declarant as a witness at a subsequent evidentiary hearing in that disciplinary process.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">The purpose of the Peer Review process is to provide an open and frank environment in which the parties and corn<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>plainant will feel comfortable to \u201cput it all on the table\u201d in the hopes that they may be able to work, in an informal and cooperative matter, toward a mutually acceptable solution. This environment, however, is accomplished only by allowing both the respondent attorney and complainant the ability to make otherwise conciliatory or potentially inculpatory statements in seeking a mutual solution, without the fear that those statements may be used against him or her at a later hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\">Although the confidentiality provision was intended facially as a safeguard for attorneys accused of misconduct, an unfortunate byproduct of that confidentiality, as highlighted by Lee\u2019s argument in this case, is the possibility that a complainant could undermine the process by using the Peer Review Panel proceeding to audition one version of the \u201cfacts\u201d and later change his or her story to suit a different approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">Despite the common sense appeal of permitting use of statements made during the Peer Review process to expose later inconsistencies or intentional misrepresentations, we conclude that the better course is to declaim, borrowing and mutating somewhat a currently popular advertising slogan, \u201cwhat happens in Peer Review stays in Peer Review.\u201d The comprehensive and sweeping language of Md. Rule 16-723(a) reflects our conclusion that the Peer Review process will only be effective if <em>all </em>statements made at a Peer Review Panel meeting are insulated from subsequent disclosure in the remaining stages of the attorney grievance process. A respondent attorney who anticipates or expects a complainant or other person will present false or inconsistent testimony at the evidentiary hearing does have, however, some ultimate protections. Once a Petition for Disciplinary or Remedial Action is filed, a respondent attorney is afforded all the discovery tools that are available to litigants in a civil trial, including depositions. Md. Rule 16-756. Using these, a respondent attorney should be able to ascertain a potential witness\u2019s position or testimony, under oath, before the evidentiary hearing, thus \u201cfreezing\u201d the deponent\u2019s account and enabling the attorney to prepare his or her case, irrespective of what may be recollect<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>ed regarding what the person may have said at the Peer Review proceeding. If a deponent changes his or her story after being deposed, the respondent attorney has a potent and, more importantly, an admissible weapon to expose a less than truthful witness or one with poor recall.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> In this case, however, Lee apparently chose not to depose Mary or John Smith.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">Furthermore, any concerns that a respondent attorney has been prejudiced by false statements made during the Peer Review process are ameliorated by the fact that the respondent attorney ultimately will have the opportunity to confront the complainant, under oath, at an evidentiary hearing. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Harris, </em>310 Md. 197, 202, 528 A.2d 895, 897 (1987) (holding that \u201cany irregularity in the proceedings before the Inquiry Panel and the Review Board ordinarily will not amount to a denial of due process, as long as the lawyer is given notice and an opportunity to defend in a full and fair hearing following the institution of disciplinary proceedings in this Court\u201d); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Stewart, </em>285 Md. 251, 259, 401 A.2d 1026, 1030 (1979); <em>c.f Bd. of Physician Quality Assurance v. Levitsky, </em>353 Md. 188, 205-07, 725 A.2d 1027, 1035-37 (1999) (finding that irregularities in the Peer Review process governing physicians may not serve as the basis for overturning a decision made by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>Board of Physician Quality Assurance after a full evidentiary hearing in front of an administrative law judge).</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">In his motion, Lee also alleges that the fairness of his evidentiary hearing was prejudiced because Bar Counsel introduced, and the hearing judge relied upon, evidence and testimony that was patently and demonstrably false. At the evidentiary hearing, John Smith testified that he did not receive his copy of Lee\u2019s 29 April 2002 letter to the Maryland Parole Commission requesting a parole hearing. Although John Smith did not testify directly whether he received any other correspondence from Lee\u2019s office, Bar Counsel made remarks to the hearing judge suggesting that John Smith never received <em>any </em>correspondence from Lee\u2019s office. These remarks came during recross-examination of Lee by Bar Counsel concerning a visit by Lee to John Smith at WCI in January 2004. The following exchange occurred in'this regard:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-6\">[Bar Counsel]: Are you aware that [WCI] keeps precise records of not only lawyer visits, but legal mail?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-7\">Lee: No, I\u2019m not aware of that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-8\">[Bar Counsel]: So that when you went to the institution and signed in, that\u2019s memorialized in their computer data bank? Lee: Well, it wouldn\u2019t surprise me a bit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-9\">[Bar Counsel]: Would it surprise you a bit that when I was ... up there last Monday, I had them check, and the only lawyer visit from Norman Joseph Lee was January 11th, 2004?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-10\">Lee: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-11\">[Bar Counsel]: And that there was no legal mail logged into the mailroom for John Henry Smith from 2001 to 2004 from Norman Joseph Lee?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-12\">Lee: I absolutely find that unbelievable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b145-13\">In his motion, Lee states that, subsequent to the evidentiary hearing, he discovered, through his investigatory efforts, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>the mail records from WCI demonstrate that John Smith did receive several pieces of correspondence from Lee\u2019s office. These records, included with Lee\u2019s motion, indicate facially that, within days of each date indicated on all of the pieces of correspondence that Lee testified were sent to John Smith, John Smith signed for legal mail in the \u201clegal log book\u201d maintained by WCI. This evidence may draw into question John Smith\u2019s testimony, and would be contrary to the apparent representations made by Assistant Bar Counsel that the records at WCI showed no legal mail received by John Smith.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">When, subsequent to the evidentiary hearing before a judge, a respondent attorney produces proffered new evidence that may be material to the matter, but was not introduced at the hearing, the Court of Appeals possesses the discretion to remand the proceedings so that the new evidence may be offered and, if admitted, considered by the hearing judge. Bar Counsel contends that, even if the hearing judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>had considered and believed the new evidence demonstrating that John Smith did receive the correspondence as recounted by Lee in his motion, there would remain evidence sufficient in the record to sustain each of the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions that Lee violated MRPC 1.3, 1.4(a), 8.1(a) and 8.4(c).<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Lee, however, argues that this evidence, and its implications on the overall credibility assessments of Lee and Bar Counsel\u2019s witnesses, are potentially material to each of the court\u2019s underlying findings of fact and resultant conclusions. We shall remand this matter to the hearing judge so that this evidence may be considered, if admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">For example, the hearing judge found that Lee committed violations of MRPC 1.3 by failing to personally review the case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>materials for over two years; failing to forward the results of any research or draft documents, as promised in various correspondence; failing to manage properly his workload; and, failing to meet with or speak to John and Mary Smith for nearly a two year period. The proffered new evidence, however, may draw into question John Smith\u2019s credibility on several aspects of this case, most notably the extent of any communication between him and Lee. In concluding that Lee failed to review the case materials or communicate effectively with John Smith, the hearing judge may have discounted (and likely did discount), in favor of John Smith\u2019s testimony to the contrary, Lee\u2019s testimony that he was familiar, through his own personal research, with John Smith\u2019s matter and had participated in conversations with him on several occasions. In concluding that Lee failed to manage properly John Smith\u2019s case and forward the results of his research, the hearing judge may have disbelieved, to a greater or lesser degree, Lee\u2019s testimony that he regularly kept John Smith informed, by telephone, of Lee\u2019s progress and recommendations regarding the strategy best suited to the case.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">With regard to the violations of MRPC 1.4(a), the hearing judge found that Lee failed to respond to the Smiths\u2019 requests for information, both written and made by telephone; failed to forward the results of any research or draft documents, as promised in various correspondence; and, failed to respond to Mary Smith\u2019s repeated requests for the return of transcripts and papers for a period of three weeks. The first two findings suggest that the judge did not find Lee\u2019s testimony credible as to the frequency and content of his communications with Mary and John Smith. The proffered new evidence, however, if admitted and found credible, bears directly on John Smith\u2019s credibility regarding his testimony concerning the level of communication between himself and Lee. Lee\u2019s evidence, in turn, reflects positively on his own credibility, including with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>regard to the events surrounding Mary Smith\u2019s termination of representation and her attempts to obtain the transcripts.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">Finally, the hearing court concluded that Lee \u201cviolated [MRPC] 8.1(a) and 8.4(c) when he misrepresented to the Attorney Grievance Commission that the cause for delay in pursuing the legal matter for which he was retained was due to the unavailability of transcripts.\u201d At the evidentiary hearing, there was conflicting testimony from Lee and Mary Smith as to precisely what documents were contained in the box that Mary Smith brought to Lee\u2019s office in April 2001. The judge\u2019s finding that Lee was misleading about his access to the necessary transcripts appears to rest, to some degree, on the hearing judge\u2019s rejection of Lee\u2019s testimony at the evidentiary hearing that the box of documents that Mary Smith brought to Lee\u2019s office did not contain the transcripts needed to pursue an effective post-conviction petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">The hearing judge also concluded that Lee violated MRPC 8.1(a) and 8.4(c) by making a material misrepresentation when he \u201cstated that [Mary Smith] \u2018eventually\u2019 delivered \u2018a box full of transcripts, pleadings, Memorandums of Law and voluminous research materials\u2019 \u2014 falsely implying that these documents were delivered to his office much later than April 21, 2001.\u201d The judge stated that Lee \u201cknew this statement was a misrepresentation because he had acknowledged receipt of the same documents in his May 4, 2001 letter to Mr. Smith.\u201d Lee claimed, however, that it was his best recollection that, in addition to her delivery of a box of documents in April 2001, Mary Smith also brought to his office more documents later in June 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">Each of the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions of a violation of the MRPC represents, to one degree or another, a rejection of Lee\u2019s testimony in favor of the testimony of either John or Mary Smith. Although the proffered potential evidence of John Smith\u2019s receipt of certain correspondence may not be directly relevant to all of these violations, if this evidence is received, it bolsters the credibility of Lee\u2019s previously rendered testimony. When new evidence that reflects materially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>and positively on the veracity of the attorney\u2019s earlier testimony is brought to the Court\u2019s attention subsequent to the evidentiary hearing, we reserve the right to remand the case so that the hearing judge may consider properly whether to admit that evidence and, if so, what effect it has on the credibility assessments previously made and conclusions drawn. This is especially true, in cases such as the present one, where the findings of fact and conclusions of law depend heavily on the determination of the credibility of two or more material witnesses with directly contrary accounts of material events.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">CASE REMANDED TO THE HEARING JUDGE OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE COUNTY FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS NOT INCONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION. COSTS TO ABIDE THE RESULT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b123-7\">. In his letter, John Smith inquired as to the legal merit of a claim brought to his attention by a fellow inmate. The claim apparently rested on the contention that, because Smith's co-defendant had confessed to being the first degree principal and was thereafter sentenced to 25 years in prison, common law legal principles prevented John Smith, who claimed that he was not a first degree principal, from receiving a greater sentence than the first degree principal. Lee asserted, however, that his \"research\" indicated that John Smith indeed was convicted as a first degree principal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b124-8\">. The record is obscure as to why records of Maryland State court proceedings in Smith's criminal matters would (or could) be obtained from a Philadelphia, Pennsylvania repository.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b125-7\">. There was conflicting testimony at the evidentiary hearing in this case as to how John Smith became aware of the fact that he was scheduled for a parole hearing. Furthermore, although Lee presented testimony suggesting that he never was informed by WCI that the parole hearing request was withdrawn, an official from WCI testified that Lee never made any inquiries regarding the status of the parole hearing request.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b126-7\">. Despite conflicting testimony as to whether Mary Smith received certain correspondence relating directly to her husband\u2019s matter, she did admit to receiving correspondence pertaining to at least two situations, unrelated to the pursuit of a post-conviction petition, in which Lee acted on John Smith\u2019s behalf in regard to prison-related issues.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b126-8\">. Lee testified that, sometime later in December 2002, he dismissed Jones from his employment due to concerns over Jones\u2019s integrity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b127-7\">. This testimony was corroborated by a client ledger, introduced into evidence by Lee, that contained detailed time records documenting all work done by his office related to the Smith case. Lee, however, testified that the entries on the client ledger were not made contemporaneously with the work indicated, but rather were made subsequent to Mary Smith\u2019s complaint and in anticipation of the evidentiary hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b129-7\">. As explained more fully <em>infra, </em>the Peer Review process, governed primarily by Md. Rules 16-713, 16-723, 16-742, and 16-743, provides a confidential and informal opportunity in which a panel composed of fellow attorneys and at least one lay person determines, based on statements or papers from the complainant(s), the respondent attorney, and any other persons the panel chooses to hear from, whether the matter can be resolved informally or whether dismissal or further, formal disciplinary action should be recommended against the respondent attorney.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b129-8\">.

Lee states that ''[c]omplainant, Mary Ellen Smith, also gave false testimony to the Court; however, Respondent was precluded from impeaching her testimony, based on [Bar Counsel\u2019s] argument to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>court that <em>ANYTHING </em>said at the Peer Review Hearing was not relevant and could not be used for ANY purpose in the Circuit Court trial.\u201d (Emphasis in original). He points to the following exchange between himself and Bar Counsel during Lee's recross-examination of Mary Smith:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-6\">[Lee]: Miss Smith, at the peer review hearing you testified\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-7\">[Bar Counsel]: I\u2019m going to object. Under the rules governing attorney discipline all matters pertaining to what happens during peer review meeting are confidential without waiver. The Respondent has made reference to the proceeding but without particularity. So I did not interpose an objection. But I would suggest that the confidentiality that the Court of Appeals has imposed upon peer review meetings is for a number of reasons but it is intractable and basically an unwaivable status of confidentiality. So any reference to her previous testimony or even what transpired through the proceeding is not even [sic] not admissible, but not even subject to discussion. The Court: Well, I don\u2019t know what was going to be asked but let me just ask this question of you. Suppose, for example, the witness gave testimony or gave statements at the peer review hearing that Respondent believes are inconsistent with her testimony today. Are you telling me that because of the confidentiality rule he can't question her about her prior inconsistent statements?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-8\">[Bar Counsel]: Yes, Your Honor, I am. It is an unqualified rule that the Court adopted that it is totally confidential, can be used for no purposes....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-9\">[Lee]: Your honor, I can cut this. I will rephrase the question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-10\">The Court: All right.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-11\">Although Lee claims in his motion and exceptions that he was precluded from presenting evidence regarding statements made by Mary Smith at the Peer Review Panel meeting, one reasonably could conclude from this exchange that Lee failed to preserve adequately his objection by acquiescing in Bar Counsel\u2019s construction of the confidentiality rule and offering to rephrase his question to avoid implicating statements reputedly made at the Peer Review proceeding. Indeed, we could find in this record no ruling by the hearing judge adopting explicitly Bar Counsel's position with respect to the admissibility of Mary Smith\u2019s prior statements. Because we are remanding this case for further proceedings for a different reason and thus it is possible this issue may arise anew then, we shall address this point now.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b134-7\">. The Review Board consisted of 18 members; 15 members were attorneys selected by the Board of Governors of the Maryland State Bar Association, Inc.

Former Md. Rule 16705(d) (2000).

The substance of the these exceptions demonstrates that the general confidentiality rule in former Md.Rule 16-708 was less than absolute. In <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Strathen, </em>287 Md. 111, 117-20, 411 A.2d 102, 105-07 (1980), the Court examined and interpreted the exception found in former Md. Rule 16-708(b)(3)(embodied at the time in former Md. Rule BV8(b)(3)), which provided that \u201c[a] judicial tribunal may request and receive any information that is relevant to the business of the tribunal.\u201d In <em>Strathen, </em>a woman who previously filed a complaint against an attorney that did not result in the filing of charges in the Court of Appeals subsequently brought a legal malpractice claim against the attorney. The attorney filed a motion for the production by the Commission of the transcript of the woman\u2019s testimony in front of the Inquiry Panel based on its purported relevance in the malpractice action. The Court held that the transcripts were discoverable because the trial court's need for the transcripts in the malpractice action was well within the plain language of the exception to confidentiality found in former Rule 16-708. <em>Strathen, </em>287 Md. at 119, 411 A.2d at 107.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">In <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. A.S. Abell Co., </em>294 Md. 680, 687, 452 A.2d 656, 659 (1982), however, the Court narrowed the scope of another exception to the general rule of confidentiality. Although former Md. Rule 16\u2014708(b)(2) (embodied at the time in former Md. Rule BV8(b)(2)) provided that the dispositions of complaints sent to the complainant were not confidential, the Court held that such dispositions could not be disclosed under the Maryland Public Information Act, codified at the time at Md.Code (1957, 1980 Repl.Vol.), Art. 76A, \u00a7\u00a7 1-5. The Court held that this exception was essentially for tire limited purpose of informing the complainant of the disposition of the complaint, but otherwise was cloaked with the confidentiality of those proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at 687, 452 A.2d at 659.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b136-7\">. A Conditional Diversion Agreement is an agreement, voluntarily entered into by Bar Counsel and the respondent attorney, that allows <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>the attorney to avoid disciplinary sanctions if he or she acknowledges that he or she engaged in conduct that constitutes professional misconduct and agrees to appropriate remedial conditions, such as restitution, treatment of physical or mental conditions, specific legal education courses, and/or a public apology. Md. Rule 16-736. The Agreement must be approved by the Commission, and may be revoked if the respondent attorney fails to comply with the Agreement or engages in further conduct that would constitute professional misconduct. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b137-5\">. Md. Rule 16\u2014741 (a)( 1) governs the circumstances under which Bar Counsel may file with the Commission a Statement of Charges:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-6\">(a) Filing of Statement of Charges. (1) Upon completion of an investigation, Bar Counsel shall file with the Commission a Statement of Charges if Bar Counsel determines that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-7\">(A) the attorney either engaged in conduct constituting professional misconduct or is incapacitated;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-8\">(B) the professional misconduct or the incapacity does not warrant an immediate Petition for Disciplinary or Remedial Action;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-9\">(C) a Conditional Diversion Agreement is either not appropriate under the circumstances or the parties were unable to agree on one; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-10\">(D) a reprimand is either not appropriate under the circumstances or (i) one was offered and rejected by the attorney, or (ii) a proposed reprimand was disapproved by the Commission and Bar Counsel was directed to file a Statement of Charges.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b138-6\">. Under the current rules, the only action taken by Bar Counsel that may result in a Peer Review Panel proceeding is the filing of a Statement of Charges. Nonetheless, although the Peer Review process was enacted as a safeguard for the respondent attorney, the attorney is not required to participate in a Peer Review Panel proceeding. Md. Rule 16\u2014743(b)(2). If the Peer Review process is terminated due to the lack of cooperation by the respondent attorney, however, the Commission may take any action that could be taken or recommended by the Peer Review Panel, including the filing of a Petition for Disciplinary or Remedial Action. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b138-7\">.

Rule 16-723(a) was intended to mirror the strict level of confidentiality imposed on the mediation process. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 17-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>109 (imposing near-absolute confidentiality on all persons present or participating in a mediation).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b144-5\">. Lee\u2019s concern bears some resemblance to Bar Counsel's concern, voiced throughout the rules revision process, that a respondent attorney may be tempted to make false statements at the Peer Review Panel meeting because, if the Peer Review Panel members believed the respondent attorney, the panel would recommend dismissal of the complaint and the disciplinary process most likely would end without further action. <em>See </em>144th Report of the Standing Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure: Hearings Before the Court of Appeals (8 Nov. 2000) (on file at the Court of Appeals). Bar Counsel stated that, to prevent such abuse of the process, he may be forced, in certain situations, to subpoena and depose a respondent attorney before the Peer Review process so that the attorney\u2019s statements could be used later for impeachment at the Peer Review Panel meeting. <em>Id.; see </em>Md. Rule 16-732 (allowing the Chair of the Commission to authorize the issuance of an \u201cinvestigative subpoena\u201d if the subpoena is \u201cnecessary to and in furtherance of an investigation being conducted by Bar Counsel pursuant to Rule 16-731 ...\").</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b146-5\">. In his motion, Lee also alleges that the Assistant Bar Counsel not only presented false testimony, but knew that the testimony was false when he presented it. In his motion, Lee stated that Assistant Bar Counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-6\">misrepresented [the fact of whether John Smith had received any correspondence from Lee's office] to the Court during trial. If [Bar Counsel] had, in fact, checked the logs during his visit to \"prep\u201d John Henry Smith for trial ..., then he KNEW his witness was testifying falsely. Conversely, if he did not check the logs as he stated, [Bar Counsel] misrepresented to the Court that he had done so. Either way, [Bar Counsel] <em>deliberately </em>misled the Court by misrepresenting the nature and content of the logs, by falsely asserting personal knowledge of facts in issue, and/or by assisting his witness to testify falsely.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">(Emphasis in original)</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-8\">In his response to Lee's exceptions, Assistant Bar Counsel explained that he had \"a good faith basis for making the inquiry as stated.\u201d He stated that, when he went to WCI to interview John Smith in preparation for the evidentiary hearing, he made an inquiiy of the guard in charge of admission to the facility as to how to determine whether a particular inmate had received legal mail. Although the WCI guard provided accurate information regarding the number of recent visits by Lee to WCI, Bar Counsel stated that the guard, after communicating with the custodian of the \"legal log book,\u201d informed Bar Counsel that the log reflected no legal mail from Lee\u2019s office.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b147-6\">. Bar Counsel also argues that Lee's motion was not timely filed with the hearing judge and \"attempts to introduce evidence well past the time within which the disciplinary matter was required to have been completed at trial.\u201d Petitioner's Response to Respondent's Exceptions at 8. Bar Counsel cites Md. Rule 16-757(a), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-7\">(a) Generally. The hearing of a disciplinary or remedial action is governed by the rules of evidence and procedure applicable to a court trial in a civil action tried in a circuit court. Unless extended by the Court of Appeals, the hearing shall be completed within 120 days after service on the respondent of the order designating a judge. Before the conclusion of the hearing, the judge may permit any complainant to testily, subject to cross-examination, regarding the effect of the alleged misconduct. A respondent attorney may offer, or the judge may inquire regarding, evidence otherwise admissible of any remedial action undertaken relevant to the allegations. Bar Counsel may respond to any evidence of remedial action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">We assume, therefore, in his argument that Lee\u2019s motion was not timely filed, Bar Counsel relies on the rule of civil procedure embodied in Md. Rule 2-535(c), which provides that a party may move for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence only if that motion is filed within 30 days after entry of judgment. Lee's motion, however, was filed in this Court on 11 January 2005, more than 30 days after the filing of the hearing judge's Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law. The short response to this argument is that this Court has original jurisdiction over all matters of attorney discipline. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Christopher, </em>383 Md. 624, 638, 861 A.2d 692, 700 (2004) (citations omitted). Although the rules of evidence applicable to civil litigation are applicable to the evidentiary hearing in attorney grievance cases, we reserve the right to order further proceedings following the filing of findings of fact and conclusions of law as justice may require from our review of what is before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b148-6\">. Lee claimed that, in response to inquiries by John Smith as to certain motions mentioned in correspondence, he communicated the results of his research to Smith and his conclusions that such a motion would be fruitless.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<p id=\"b150-5\">RAKER, J., concurs.</p>\n<author id=\"b150-6\">RAKER, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Arf\">concurring:</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">I would hold that an inconsistent statement may not be used as substantive evidence, but, in order to prevent perjury and to protect the integrity of the judicial process, that a prior inconsistent statement may be used for impeachment purposes. <em>Cf. Harris v. New York, </em>401 U.S. 222, 226, 91 S.Ct. 643, 646, 28 L.Ed.2d 1 (1971) (permitting criminal defendant\u2019s credibility to be impeached by use of prior inconsistent statement and holding that \u201c[t]he shield provided by <em>Miranda </em>cannot be perverted into a license to use perjury by way of a defense, free from the risk of confrontation with prior inconsistent utterances\u201d). Although confidentiality is important in peer review proceedings, it is not always sacrosanct and must yield to the right of an attorney to defend him or herself in these most serious of disciplinary proceedings. <em>Cf. Pennsylvania v. Ritchie, </em>480 U.S. 39, 61, 107 S.Ct. 989, 1003, 94 L.Ed.2d 40 (1987) (holding that a defendant\u2019s due process right entitled him to know whether protective services\u2019 confidential file on the alleged abuse of his daughter contained information that may have changed the outcome of his trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>had it been disclosed); <em>Davis v. Alaska, </em>415 U.S. 308, 319, 94 S.Ct. 1105, 1112, 39 L.Ed.2d 347 (1974) (holding that a defendant\u2019s right to juvenile records to impeach the credibility of the State\u2019s witness outweighed the State\u2019s interest in maintaining the confidentiality of such records). I concur in the judgment of the Court remanding this matter for further hearings in the Circuit Court. I disagree, however, with the Court\u2019s holding that all statements made at a Peer Review Panel remain totally confidential and privileged and, therefore, are unavailable for use to impeach a witness as a prior inconsistent statement at a subsequent evidentiary hearing in that disciplinary process.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">I do not find that the plain reading of the Rule requires the conclusion that <em>all </em>statements, no matter who the declarant is, be unavailable for use to impeach a witness against an attorney at a subsequent disciplinary hearing against that attorney. While the laudatory purpose of the Rule is to promote candor and an open and frank environment, the purpose cannot be to protect false statements. <em>See Hernandez v. State, </em>203 Ariz. 196, 52 P.3d 765, 768-69 (2002) (en banc) (holding that inconsistent statements made during confidential compromise negotiations are admissible at a subsequent hearing for impeachment purposes because excluding impeachment evidence would not further the policy of encouraging complete candor); 23 Charles Alan Wright &amp; Kenneth W. Graham, Jr., <em>Federal Practice &amp; Procedure </em>\u00a7 5314 (1980) (stating that \u201c[t]he purpose of [Federal] Rule 408 [ precluding use of statements made during compromise negotiations] is to foster \u2018complete candor\u2019 between the parties, not to protect false representations\u201d); <em>see also </em>Lynne H.
