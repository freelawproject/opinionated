Scott Scroggs <footnotemark>1</footnotemark>, a member of that bar, practiced law. We are asked to decide the impact on Mr. Scroggs\u2019s privilege to practice law in Maryland as a result of the Supreme Court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>Oklahoma\u2019s approval of respondent\u2019s resignation from the Oklahoma bar pending disciplinary proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">The Supreme Court of Oklahoma, in a previous disciplinary proceeding, suspended respondent from the practice of law for one year for violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct. <em>State ex rel. Oklahoma Bar Ass\u2019n v. R. Scott Scroggs, </em>70 P.3d 821 (2003) (petition for rehearing pending). While additional disciplinary proceedings were pending in Oklahoma, the complainant in those proceedings, the Oklahoma Bar Association, applied for an order approving the resignation of the respondent, R. Scott Scroggs, pending disciplinary proceedings. In conjunction with the action taken by the Bar Association, respondent filed in the same proceedings an Affidavit of Resignation from membership in the Oklahoma bar pending disciplinary proceedings. The Supreme Court of Oklahoma approved the application of the Bar Association and the resignation of R. Scott Scroggs. <em>State ex rel. Oklahoma Bar Ass\u2019n v. R. Scott Scroggs, </em>71 P.3d 15 (2003). Pursuant to Oklahoma law, Mr. Scroggs\u2019s resignation while disciplinary proceedings were pending is the equivalent of a disbarment. <em>Scroggs, </em>71 P.3d at 17 (citing <em>State ex rel. Oklahoma Bar Ass\u2019n v. Bourland, 19 P.3d </em>289, 291 (2001)). In Oklahoma, \u201ca lawyer resigning pending disciplinary proceedings may not make application for reinstatement prior to the expiration of five years from the date of the order approving the resignation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>citing <em>State ex rel. Oklahoma Bar Ass\u2019n v. Grunewald, </em>27 P.3d 482, 483 (2001); <em>State ex rel. Oklahoma Bar Ass\u2019n v. Redell, </em>38 P.3d 227, 228 (2001). In the order dated May 20, 2003, the Supreme Court of Oklahoma approved respondent\u2019s resignation, struck his name from the Roll of Attorneys, ordered that Mr. Scroggs could make no application for reinstatement to membership in the Oklahoma Bar Association before five years from the effective date of the court\u2019s order, and ordered him to repay with interest, to the Oklahoma Bar Association Clients\u2019 Security Trust Fund, any funds expended on his behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>Respondent\u2019s Affidavit of Resignation filed with the Supreme Court of Oklahoma asserted that \u201cit was freely and voluntarily rendered; he was not subject to coercion or duress; and he was fully aware of the consequences of submitting the resignation.\u201d He also noted that he was suspended from the practice of law for one year in a previous case and that a petition for rehearing was pending. Respondent acknowledged that he was aware that the burden of proof rests upon the Bar Association in disciplinary proceedings, and that he waived any and all right to contest the allegations. In addition, Mr. Scroggs\u2019s resignation stated that a 25-page complaint was filed in the Supreme Court against him alleging misconduct for violation of Rules 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5(a) and (c), 1.15(a), (b) and (c), 1.16(d), 3.2, 8.1, and 8.4(c) of the Rules of Professional Conduct and Rule 5.2 of the Rules Governing Disciplinary Proceedings. He also acknowledged seven separate grievances filed with the Office of General Counsel against him for misconduct. <em>Id. </em>at 16. In addition to his acknowledgment of pending complaints, Mr. Scroggs stated in the affidavit that, \u201crespondent is aware that allegations concerning his conduct, if proven, would constitute violations of the ... [Rules of Professional Conduct and the Rules Governing Disciplinary Proceedings].... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">On May 26, 2004, The Attorney Grievance Commission of Maryland (hereinafter \u201cBar Counsel\u201d), acting pursuant to Rules 16-751<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and 16-773<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of the Md. Rules, filed a Petition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>for Disciplinary or Remedial Action against Mr. Scroggs to which a certified copy of the Oklahoma Supreme Court\u2019s Order Approving Resignation Pending Disciplinary Proceedings and Order Suspending Respondent from the Practice of Law for One Year were attached. In the Petition, Bar Counsel alleged that respondent is subject to the disciplinary authority of this State pursuant to Maryland Rule 16-701 and charged that respondent engaged in misconduct as defined therein, specifically, failing to report his discipline in Oklahoma to Bar Counsel in violation of Maryland Rule 16-773(a), and MRPC 1.1 (Competence)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>, 1.2 (Scope of Representation)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>1.3 (Diligence)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>, 1.4 (Communication)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>,1.5 (Fees)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>, 1.15 (Safekeeping Property)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>, 1.16 (Declining or Terminating Represent<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>ation)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>, 8.2 (Expediting Litigation)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>, 8.1 (Bar Admission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>and Disciplinary Matters)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>, and 8.4 (Misconduct)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-10\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>A lawyer shall provide competent representation to a client. Competent representation requires the legal knowledge, skill, thoroughness and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>This Court issued three Show Cause Orders directing personal service on the respondent on or before a date certain and directing respondent to show cause in writing based upon any of the grounds set forth in Maryland Rule 16-778(e) why disbarment should not be imposed by this Court. Bar Counsel contends that it was unable to serve Mr. Scroggs personally. Thus it was necessary to serve notice on respondent\u2019s agent, the Client Protection Fund of the Bar of Maryland pursuant to Rule 16-753 <footnotemark>14</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>On November 8, 2004, respondent filed a written response to the order to show cause served upon the Client Protection Fund. In his response, respondent asserts that the Petition for Disciplinary or Remedial Action and Show Cause Order were never personally served on him and that Rule 16-754<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> is not applicable because Rule 16-753 requires reasonable efforts to serve process and one attempt at personal service was not reasonable in this case. We will address the issue of service of the orders to show cause later in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">In our review of the Petition for Disciplinary or Remedial Action and Respondent\u2019s Response To A Show Cause Order, we are guided by Maryland Rule 16-773. Pursuant to Rule 16-773(a) an attorney who in another jurisdiction is disbarred, suspended, or resigns from the bar while disciplinary or remedial action is threatened or pending in that jurisdiction shall inform Bar Counsel promptly of the discipline, resignation, or inactive status. Section (c) of Rule 16-773 requires that, after a petition and certified copy of a disciplinary or remedial order have been filed, the Court must order that Bar Counsel and the attorney \u201cshow cause in writing based upon any grounds set forth in section (e) of this Rule why corre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>sponding discipline\u201d should not be imposed. Specifically, 16-773(e) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-4\">Reciprocal discipline shall not be ordered if Bar Counsel or the attorney demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that: (1) the procedure was so lacking in notice or opportunity to be heard as to constitute a deprivation of due process; (2) there was such infirmity of proof establishing the misconduct as to give rise to a clear conviction that the Court, consistent with its duty, cannot accept as final the determination of misconduct; (3) the imposition of corresponding discipline would result in grave injustice; (4) the conduct established does not constitute misconduct in this State or it warrants substantially different discipline in this State; or (5) the reason for inactive status no longer exists.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ax2\">Rule 16-773(g), provides in relevant part that: \u201cA final adjudication in a disciplinary or remedial proceeding by another court ... is conclusive evidence of that misconduct.... \u201d <em>Atty. Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Roberson, </em>373 Md. 328, 818 A.2d 1059 (2003) (a challenge to the original adjudication in reciprocal discipline actions is limited to notice and opportunity to be heard or infirmity of proof). We have recognized in reciprocal disciplinary cases that a respondent is not allowed, other than as provided by our rules, to collaterally attack either the findings of fact or the judgment rendered by the original jurisdiction. <em>Atty. Griev. Comn\u2019n v. Sabghir, </em>350 Md. 67, 81, 710 A.2d 926, 932-33(1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">Although respondent fails to raise any of the exceptional circumstances outlined in Rule 16-773(e), his assault on the Oklahoma disciplinary proceedings is launched on several fronts. First, he contends that although the Supreme Court of Oklahoma issued an order suspending him from the practice of law for one year, the filing of his petition for reconsideration automatically suspended that order. Second, he posits that the orders issued by the Supreme Court of Oklahoma on March 4, 2003 (suspension) and May 20, 2003 (order approving resignation) were not remedial or disciplinary orders. Respondent reasons that an order approving an attorney\u2019s resignation from the practice of law is not \u201ca disciplinary or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>remedial order.\u201d In addition, although acknowledging that resignation pending disciplinary proceedings is tantamount to a disbarment in Oklahoma, his view is that that statement of the law refers only to the procedural similarities in applying for readmission to the bar. Third, respondent asserts that in the order of resignation, the Supreme Court of Oklahoma made no findings of fact as to the allegations against him. Thus, the allegations stated in the order approving his resignation were never subjected to court review. Moreover, he argues that Rule 16-773 was not intended to cover resignations pending disciplinary proceedings because that type of proceeding does not result in an order to disbar, thus, the show cause order we issued was improper. Finally, respondent contends he was never properly served with the Maryland petition and show cause order. According to Mr. Scroggs, there was only one attempt to serve him and copies of the documents filed in these proceedings were never mailed to him. Therefore, the default provisions of Rule 16-754 are not applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">Taking a contrary view of the Oklahoma proceedings, petitioner contends that respondent was disciplined twice. First, he was suspended for one year from the practice of law by the Supreme Court of Oklahoma, and that constituted a final order despite respondent\u2019s filing a petition for rehearing. Moreover, respondent confirmed his suspension when he admitted his suspension in the context of his subsequent Affidavit of Resignation. According to petitioner, the motion for reconsideration was never granted. Therefore, the issues raised by the motion are moot because the Supreme Court of Oklahoma approved the application for resignation pending disciplinary proceedings. Petitioner argues that the affidavit respondent signed and filed with the Supreme Court of Oklahoma contains the very same kinds of statements as required by Md. Rule 16\u2014772(b)(2)<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> regarding an attorney\u2019s affidavit to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>consent to discipline for misconduct. Mr. Scroggs waived his right to contest the factual allegations in the Oklahoma proceedings, and acknowledged that if the allegations are proven, they constitute misconduct. As to Oklahoma law, petitioner asserts that there is no distinction between disbarment and an order approving resignation pending disciplinary proceedings relying on <em>State ex rel. Oklahoma Bar Ass\u2019n v. Bourland, </em>19 P.3d 289, 291 (2001). Finally, in petitioner\u2019s view Mr. Scroggs was properly served under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">We note that respondent cites no case law or statutory authority to support his position on the status of Oklahoma law. Rule 6.15(c) of the Oklahoma Rules Governing Disciplinary Proceedings provides that either party to a disciplinary proceeding may file a petition for rehearing within 20 days after mailing of the court\u2019s decision. Respondent filed a petition for reconsideration which the court did not rule upon. We are unable to find any reported Oklahoma cases discussing Rule 6.15 generally or specifically as to the effect of a pending petition for rehearing on the disciplinary orders of the court. As a practical matter, however, the fact that the petition for rehearing is pending is of no consequence to our decision in this case. The Supreme Court of Oklahoma rendered its decision suspending Mr. Scroggs on March 3, 2003. As of the date of this opinion, the Oklahoma Supreme Court has not published its ruling on the petition for rehearing and more than one year has passed since the court entered its order suspending Mr. Scroggs from the practice of law. Hence, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>our view the issue is moot. The final decision of the Oklahoma Supreme Court, as published in <em>State ex rel. Oklahoma Bar Association v. Scroggs, </em>70 P.3d 821(2003), is that respondent was suspended from the practice of law in Oklahoma for the reasons of misconduct as explained by the court in its published opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">We agree with petitioner that there is no difference between an order of disbarment and an order approving resignation pending disciplinary proceedings under Oklahoma law in view of the consequences to respondent\u2019s privilege to practice law. Respondent\u2019s license to practice law is terminated under either disposition. Both dispositions flow out of disciplinary proceedings. Respondent is required to meet the standards for admission if, and when, he seeks readmission to the bar. Further as a limitation on his ability to practice law, respondent may not make an application for reinstatement prior to the expiration of five years from the date of the order approving the resignation. <em>State ex rel. Oklahoma Bar Ass\u2019n v. Scroggs, </em>71 P.3d 15 (2003).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">There is no merit to respondent\u2019s contention that the order of suspension and the order approving his resignation were not remedial or disciplinary orders of the court. Indeed, his resignation in light of disciplinary proceedings was the equivalent of disbarment. The court approved Mr. Scroggs\u2019s resignation on the condition that he did not challenge the allegations of misconduct and on the condition that he freely and voluntarily admitted that the allegations of misconduct, if proven, would constitute violations of specific enumerated rules of professional conduct. It was the disciplinary proceedings and the allegations of misconduct against Mr. Scroggs which served as the predicate for the court\u2019s disposition. Under the Maryland Rules of discipline, \u201cdisbarment means unconditional termination of any privilege to practice law in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>this State____\u201d Rule 16-701(e). The resignation pending disciplinary proceedings in Oklahoma is, indeed, tantamount to a disbarment in Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">The affidavit Mr. Scroggs signed and filed with the court contained the same statements required by Md. Rule 16-772(b)(2). Similarly, in Maryland when an attorney consents to discipline, he or she must certify by affidavit, among other things, that he or she, \u201cknows that if a hearing were to be held, sufficient evidence could be produced to sustain the allegations of misconduct.\u201d Here, respondent acknowledged the misconduct alleged and waived any right to contest the allegations. His overall consent to resignation pending disciplinary proceedings was the equivalent of consent to disciplinary action in Maryland. We hold, therefore, that the proceedings held in Oklahoma with regard to respondent\u2019s suspension and resignation pending disciplinary proceedings were, in fact, disciplinary or remedial actions subjecting Mr. Scroggs to the imposition of reciprocal discipline in Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">From our review of the record, we find that service of the Petition for Disciplinary or Remedial Action and the order to show cause were properly served on the Client Protection Fund. An affidavit and report filed in these proceedings details the efforts of Mr. Dennis F. Biennas, Investigator with the Attorney Grievance Commission of Maryland, to serve respondent. Because the multiple attempts to communicate with respondent and contact him personally for the purpose of service of process failed, it was reasonable to serve him through the Client Protection Fund. <em>Atty. Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Faber, </em>373 Md. 173, 817 A.2d 205(2003). Respondent filed in this Court a timely response to the order to show cause on November 8, 2004 <footnotemark>18</footnotemark>. In our view, respondent has failed to offer any evidence to rebut the presumption of proper service.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>It is implicit in respondent\u2019s answer to the show cause order that he violated Rule 16-773(a) in failing to promptly inform Bar Counsel of his suspension and resignation from the Oklahoma bar while disciplinary or remedial action was pending in Oklahoma. He concedes the suspension order and his resignation while disciplinary proceedings were pending, but asserts that his motion for rehearing stayed the suspension order and his resignation was not a disciplinary matter. We have rejected both contentions and hold that Mr. Scroggs violated Md. Rule 16-773(a) in failing to promptly inform Bar Counsel in Maryland of his suspension and resignation while disciplinary proceedings were pending. There is no evidence in the record to support a contrary conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">In a reciprocal discipline case we are inclined, but not required, to impose the same sanction as that imposed by the state in which the misconduct occurred. <em>Atty Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Ruffin, </em>369 Md. 238, 253-254, 798 A.2d 1139, 1148 (2002). We are required to assess for ourselves the propriety of the sanction imposed by the other jurisdiction and that recommended by the Commission. <em>Atty Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Gittens, </em>346 Md. 316, 326, 697 A.2d 83, 88 (1997). We are also required to consider \u201cthe particular facts and circumstances of each case, the outcome being dependent upon the latter, but with a view toward consistent dispositions for similar misconduct.\u201d <em>Atty. Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Roberson, </em>373 Md. 328, 356, 818 A.2d 1059, 1076 (2003) (citations omitted). As in Oklahoma, we impose sanctions not to punish the attorney, but to protect the public. <em>State ex rel. Oklahoma Bar Association v. Groshon, </em>82 P.3d 99 (2003); <em>Atty. Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Spery, </em>371 Md. 560, 568, 810 A.2d 487, 491 (2002). The petitioner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>recommends disbarment and respondent suggests that he is not subject to any discipline.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">At the time of respondent\u2019s resignation from the Oklahoma bar, he was suspended for one year, effective March 4, 2003, based upon allegations of misconduct similar to those filed in this ease. In that disciplinary proceeding the Supreme Court of Oklahoma concluded that respondent violated the following rules of professional conduct: 1.1, 1.3, 1.4(a), 1:15(a), (b), and (c), 1.16(a)(5), 3.2, 8.1(a) and 8.4(c). Specifically, with regard to Mr. Seroggs\u2019s violation of Rules 8.1(a) and 8.4(c) and the allegations of dishonesty, \u201cthe court concluded that respondent deliberately misrepresented material facts to the Oklahoma Bar Association.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Oklahoma Bar Association v. Scroggs, </em>70 P.3d 821, 833 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">The allegations of misconduct giving rise to Mr. Scroggs\u2019s resignation involved eight separate clients and involved matters of neglect, incompetence, lack of communication, and dishonesty. The complaint filed against him also contained allegations of misconduct for violation of Rules 8.1 and 8.4(c), The specific allegations with regard to dishonesty were that, \u201crespondent informed the [Oklahoma] Bar Association he had accounted for work to Patricia Hurst [a client], and provided Hurst with a partial refund for [legal representation] when he did not, that he made misrepresentations to the Bar.\u201d In addition, it was alleged that respondent \u201cneglected legal matters and failed to return the client\u2019s property.\u201d On another occasion, \u201che provided the Bar Association with false information.\u201d On three other occasions, individual clients each paid respondent \u201c$650.00 for legal representation and either the fee agreement was not in writing or he neglected a legal matter, or failed to communicate with the client, or made a misrepresentation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">\u201cA final adjudication in a disciplinary or remedial proceeding by another court ... that an attorney has been guilty of professional misconduct ... is conclusive evidence of that misconduct....\u201d Rule 16-773(g). The allegations forming the basis for both disciplinary proceedings in Oklahoma are not in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>dispute. Respondent\u2019s failure to promptly inform Bar Counsel of the Oklahoma discipline is not really in dispute. Specifically, however, with regard to matters of intentional dishonesty we have said that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-4\">in disciplinary matters, we will not in the future attempt to distinguish between degrees of intentional dishonesty based upon convictions, testimonial or other factors. Unlike matters relating to competency, diligence and the like, intentional dishonest conduct is closely entwined with the most important matters of basic character to such a degree as to make intentional dishonest conduct by a lawyer almost beyond excuse. Honesty and dishonesty are, or are not, present in an attorney\u2019s character.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-5\">Disbarment ordinarily should be the sanction for intentional dishonest conduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b286-6\"><em>Atty. Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Vanderlinde, </em>364 Md. 376, 418, 773 A.2d 463, 488 (2001). Thus, if respondent\u2019s misconduct had occurred in Maryland, ordinarily we would have imposed the sanction of disbarment.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">Oklahoma has held that the effect of an attorney\u2019s resignation pending disciplinary proceedings is the equivalent of a disbarment. Respondent\u2019s resignation, therefore, is tantamount to a disbarment for five years beginning, May 20, 2003. After five years, respondent may apply for readmission to the Oklahoma bar. If granted admission there, he could apply for readmission to the Maryland bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">Rule 11.1 of the Oklahoma Rules Governing Disciplinary Proceedings covers reinstatement. Pursuant to that rule, an applicant who is either disbarred or accepts resignation pending investigation of disciplinary proceedings shall not be permitted to file an application for reinstatement, after disbarment or resignation pending investigation or disciplinary proceedings, within five (5) years of the effective date of the order of the Supreme Court of Oklahoma disbarring the applicant or accepting resignation. For purposes of disposition, Oklahoma does not distinguish between disbarment and resignation pending disciplinary proceedings. Nor shall we. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>Therefore, in this action, we defer to the decision of the Oklahoma Supreme Court and the venue where the misconduct occurred and conclude that the appropriate sanction in this reciprocal action is disbarment.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\"><em>IT IS SO ORDERED; RESPONDENT SHALL PAY ALL COSTS AS TAXED BY THE CLERK OF THIS </em>COURT, <em>INCLUDING THE COSTS OF ALL TRANSCRIPTS, PURSUANT TO MARYLAND RULE 16-761, FOR WHICH SUM JUDGMENT IS ENTERED IN FAVOR OF THE ATTORNEY GRIEVANCE COMMISSION OF MARYLAND AGAINST ROBERT SCOTT SCROGGS.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b270-16\">.

Respondent\u2019s resignation was accepted in Oklahoma, his name was stricken from the Roll of Attorneys, and the state Supreme Court ordered that five years must elapse before he may make application for readmission to that Bar. Oklahoma treats resignation while disciplinary matters are pending as disbarment.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">In Maryland, to my knowledge, no disbarred lawyer has been limited, as a matter of court order, to wait any particular period of time or to be readmitted in a foreign jurisdiction, before that lawyer may apply for readmission in the Maryland Bar. This is the situation even in reciprocal disbarment cases. While practically speaking, a disbarred lawyer must wait a substantial period of time before reapplying, this Court has not imposed a five year waiting period. What if respondent had been disbarred in Florida, Louisiana, Kentucky or Oregon, states that have permanent disbarment?
