The subsequent award of attorney\u2019s fees by a two-person Public Accommodations Panel of the Montgomery County Human Relations Commission (\u201cPanel\u201d) in favor of Mrs. Flaa has been the subject of two petitions for judicial review by the Circuit Court for Montgomery County. In the second of these petitions, the Panel had awarded Mrs. Flaa $22,440.00 in attorney\u2019s fees, an award which the hearing court affirmed. Mrs. Flaa then appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, which reversed the trial court and remanded the case to the Panel to recalculate the award. Manor then filed a petition for writ of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>certiorari<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which we granted on December 17, 2004. <em>Manor Country Club v. Flaa, </em>384 Md. 448, 863 A.2d 997 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">Manor\u2019s petition for wilt of certiorari presented the following questions for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-5\">1. \u201cWhen a county agency exercises its discretion to award attorney\u2019s fees, as specifically allowed by a county statute, is that agency required to determine reasonable attorney\u2019s fees according to a strict application of the lodestar approach, or is it required to determine reasonable attorney\u2019s fees in accordance with the dictates of the statute that provides it with the authority to award attorney\u2019s fees?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-6\">2. \u201cDid the Court of Special Appeals err by <em>refusing to apply an abuse of discretion standard to review </em>the [Public Accommodations] Panel[] [of the Montgomery County Human Relations Commission\u2019s] attorney\u2019s fee award where the record shows that the Panel reviewed, in detail, each factor required by the Montgomery County Code in making a fee award and, thereby, determined an award of reasonable hours times reasonable rate?\u201d [Alterations added.] [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">We hold that, when attorney\u2019s fees are permitted by statute or ordinance, the lodestar approach to the calculation of reasonable attorney\u2019s fees is generally the correct approach, <em>except </em>in instances where other criteria for the calculation of such fees are provided, as in the present case, in the fee-shifting statute.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As we further explain hereafter, we address the second question only insofar as is necessary in our treatment of the first \u2014 and consistent \u2014 question presented, given the discrepancy between the second question presented by Manor in its petition for writ of certiorari and in its brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>I. Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">The longevity of this case has generated an extensive set of facts. The issue before this Court, however, is limited to the proper procedure for awarding attorney\u2019s fees under the circumstances of the present case. In similarly recognizing this focus, the Court of Special Appeals, in its reported decision, <em>Flaa v. Manor Country Club, </em>158 Md.App. 483, 857 A.2d 604 (2004), confined its factual recitation of the underlying discrimination claim to those details necessary to provide context and to frame properly the issue of Mrs. Flaa\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees. Accordingly, we adopt in large part, the facts as set forth in the Court of Special Appeals\u2019s opinion, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-6\">\u201cOn December 23, 1993, [Mrs. Flaa] filed a marital status discrimination claim with the MCOHR. She averred that [Manor\u2019s] policies, which restricted access to and use of [Manor\u2019s] golf course, were discriminatory on the basis of marital status and resulted in disparate treatment of her because of sex.[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>] [After having secured legal representation, Mrs. Flaa] thereafter amended her claim [in May 1994] to add a sex discrimination claim, asserting theories of disparate impact in the membership structure and hostile environment in [Manor\u2019s] indoor restaurant, known as the Grill Room.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-7\">\u201cAt about the same time, [respondent], with others, filed a complaint with the Office of the Attorney General of Mary<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>land, identifying the same claims and setting forth the same legal theories as those alleged in the MCOHR complaint. After the Attorney\u2019s General Office launched an investigation into [Mrs. Flaa\u2019s] claims, [Manor] modified numerous club policies to avoid potential prosecution for unlawful discriminatory practices. No formal charges were ever brought against [Manor] by the State.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-4\">\u201cOn January 6, 1997, following an investigation, MCOHR found reasonable grounds to believe that [Manor] was a place of public accommodation and had violated Montgomery County Code, \u00a7 27-8 (1987) by engaging in unlawful discriminatory practices on the basis of marital status and gender.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-5\">\u201cMCOHR referred the matter to the Office of Zoning and Administrative Hearings for a public hearing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b332-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 487-88, 857 A.2d at 607 (alterations added). Six months later, on July 11, 1997, Mrs. Flaa\u2019s counsel submitted her first attorney\u2019s fees application seeking $11,699.20 in fees and $946.29 in expenses. Fourteen months later, in September 1998, she submitted to opposing counsel an updated statement showing total attorney\u2019s fees of $82,579.50 and expenses of $1,836.46.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-7\">\u201cAfter five postponements, the parties appeared before a hearing examiner on May 17, 1999, for the first day of what became a ten-day public hearing in which 33 witnesses testified and 158 exhibits were submitted as evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aqj\"><em>Id. </em>at 488, 857 A.2d at 607. On July 9, 1999, Mrs. Flaa, through counsel, submitted a statement of damages as well as a request for damages, attorney\u2019s fees, and expenses in the amounts of $1,000.00, $138,024.00, and $4,282.31, respectively.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-8\">\u201cOn September 30, 1999, the hearing examiner issued a 141-page Report and Recommendation to the Public Accommodation Panel [\u201cPanel\u201d] of the MCOHR. The report stated the hearing examiner\u2019s findings that [Manor] was a place of public accommodation; that [Manor] had engaged in sex discrimination (disparate treatment) against [respondent] during the golf course incident; and that [Manor] had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>engaged in gender-based discriminatory practices, creating a hostile environment. The hearing examiner did not find that [Manor\u2019s] practices had resulted in a disparate impact on women. The hearing examiner recommended the award to [Mrs. Flaa] of $1,000.00 in damages (the statutory limit), $120,481.00 in attorney\u2019s fees, and $4,282.31 in expenses. [Mrs. Flaa] filed a brief seeking modification by the Panel of the hearing examiner\u2019s recommendation on the disparate impact claim. [Manor] filed a response to [Mrs. Flaa\u2019s] request for modification, and separately requested that the Panel modify the hearing examiner\u2019s recommendations with respect to jurisdiction and the hostile environment claim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-4\">\u201cOn March 1, 2000, the Panel held a public hearing on the matter and allowed both parties to make oral arguments.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AfZ\"><em>Flaa, </em>158 Md.App. at 488, 857 A.2d at 606-07 (alterations added).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">In an eight-page Memorandum Opinion and Order issued May 8, 2000, the Panel adopted the hearing examiner\u2019s findings that Manor was a place of public accommodation and that Mrs. Flaa had endured harsh treatment when she was ejected from the golf course at the time of the spring 1993 incident, but found that Manor\u2019s membership practices resulted in no disparate impact between male and female members. In addition, the Panel \u201crejected the hearing examiner\u2019s finding that [Manor] had engaged in sex discrimination by creating a hostile environment, concluding that such theories are reserved for employment cases.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 489, 857 A.2d at 607 (alteration added). The Panel noted that even if such theories were available to Mrs. Flaa, the facts surrounding her claim were insufficient to rise to the level of creating a hostile environment.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">The Panel looked to Montgomery County Code \u00a7 27-7 in awarding Mrs. Flaa $750.00 (of a maximum $1,000.00) in damages for humiliation and embarrassment and generally invoked the criteria of Montgomery County Code \u00a7 27\u20147(k)(1) in awarding attorney\u2019s fees of $3,000.00 <em>(ie., </em>four times the damages award). The Panel\u2019s opinion did not provide an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>analysis of each \u00a7 27\u20147(k)(1) criterion. Rather, in reaching its attorney\u2019s fees figure, the Panel explained that it \u201crecognize[d] that some of the time billed was also related to a proceeding before the Attorney General\u2019s office, and therefore not directly related to this case,\u201d and it echoed the hearing examiner\u2019s opinion that \u201c \u2018Counsel\u2019s time is difficult to evaluate because several functions are bundled together in a manner that precludes evaluation of their reasonableness\u2019 \u201d and \u201cthat the total time billed was excessive given time expended in similar cases with the same levels of difficulty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">Mrs. Flaa and Manor each filed petitions for judicial review in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County of the Panel\u2019s opinion and order. In her memorandum urging that a hostile environment could, indeed, constitute discrimination in Maryland public accommodation, Mrs. Flaa also addressed the issue of attorney\u2019s fees, referencing several United States Supreme Court cases that address awarding attorney\u2019s fees to a prevailing party in civil rights litigation and introduced the position that \u201cin civil rights cases, attorneys\u2019 fees are calculated by multiplying the number of hours reasonably expended by a reasonable hourly rate ... commonly referred to as the \u2018lodestar.\u2019 \u201d Mrs. Flaa then stated that \u201cMontgomery County Code \u00a7 27\u20147(k)(1) provides additional guidelines for awarding attorney\u2019s fees which are parallel to the factors considered in awarding attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to Federal civil rights fee shifting statutes\u201d (footnote omitted). Mrs. Flaa also included as an exhibit a July 1999 copy of the Rules of the U.S. District Court for Maryland\u2019s \u201cAppendix B, Rules and Guidelines for Determining Lodestar Attorneys\u2019 Fees in Civil Rights and Discrimination Cases.\u201d Manor\u2019s memorandum in opposition did not address Mrs. Flaa\u2019s introduction of lodestar, and responded that the Panel had properly exercised its discretion in awarding $3,000.00 in attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">Following oral argument, the Circuit Court entered a thirty-page Memorandum Opinion and Order on August 10, 2001, affirming the Panel\u2019s decision, with the exception of its award of attorney\u2019s fees, which the Circuit Court vacated and re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>manded to the Panel. The Circuit Court held that, upon remand, the Panel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-4\">\u201c[M]ust consider the factors listed in Section 27-7(k)(1) and indicate to a reviewing court, how those factors, play a role in the determination of the award of attorney\u2019s fees. The [Panel] also must evaluate Flaa\u2019s degree of success in the pursuit of her claims.... The [Panel] should include in its consideration Flaa\u2019s claim for attorney\u2019s fees from July 9, 1999 to [August 10, 2001].\u201d [Alterations added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">The Circuit Court, labeling the Panel\u2019s award as a variation of a \u201ccost-benefit analysis,\u201d concluded that the Panel \u201cmade an error of law in its determination of the attorney\u2019s fee award in this case and in so doing abused its discretion to make such an award.\u201d Neither party appealed this remand decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">Pursuant to the Circuit Court\u2019s order, the Panel directed that Mrs. Flaa\u2019s counsel submit an application for an award of attorney\u2019s fees that incorporated \u201ca detailed analysis of each of the factors contained in Section 27-7(k)(l) of the Montgomery County Code.... \u201d Counsel thereafter submitted a revised application which echoed her earlier labeling of the hearing examiner\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees award figure of $120,481.00 as \u201cthe lodestar\u201d and then analyzed each of the \u00a7 27-7(k)(1) factors as they related to the so-called lodestar. After adding fee requests for work subsequent to the Panel\u2019s May 2000 decision, counsel arrived at final requested figures of $225,438.80 in attorney\u2019s fees and $9,306.10 in expenses. These figures represented fees from May 3, 1994 \u2014 the day Mrs. Flaa engaged legal representation \u2014 until September 27, 2001 \u2014 the day of the fee application.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">Manor filed an opposition, dated October 22, 2001, to the application for attorney\u2019s fees and costs arguing, <em>inter alia, </em>that Mrs. Flaa\u2019s County-based litigation was duplicative of her claim filed with the State Attorney General\u2019s Office \u2014 under laws that <em>did not </em>award attorney\u2019s fees, and that more than $80,000 of her time entries were non-specific, improperly bundled, excessive, non-billable clerical functions and/or unreasonable according to \u00a7 27\u20147(k)(1). Manor, although not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>clearly disputing the application of a lodestar methodology, urged that opposing counsel\u2019s use of a \u201clodestar figure\u201d was \u201cneither helpful nor accurate.\u201d Each party also included a July 2001 exhibit copy of the aforementioned Lodestar Appendix B, from the U.S. District Court Rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">In March 2002, the Panel sent the parties a memorandum requesting that Mrs. Flaa\u2019s counsel submit \u201ca revised billing report indicating the estimated time spent only on the issue of determining Manor Country Club to be a place of public aceommodation[.]\u201d In response, counsel submitted a request for attorney\u2019s fees totaling $202,520.14, consisting of $131,476.10 based on 757.17 hours spent on the issue of \u201cplace of public accommodation\u201d plus $71,044.04 based on 436.17 hours spent litigating the attorney\u2019s fees issue. Manor opposed this revised figure contending that counsel\u2019s representation that nearly seventy percent of the total billing arose from litigating the jurisdiction of the MCOHR in terms of whether Manor constituted a place of public accommodation presented an unreasonably skewed estimate of the attorney\u2019s fees incurred on that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">As of the time Mrs. Flaa brought her action in 1993, Montgomery County had in place within its legislation establishing the then-denominated Montgomery County Human Relations Commission, a subsection allowing, <em>inter alia, </em>a Commission panel, upon finding that unlawful discrimination has occurred, to award reasonable attorney\u2019s fees. This provision, found at Montgomery County Code \u00a7 27\u20147(k)(1) (1987), provided<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>\u201c\u00a7 27-7. Administration and Enforcement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-5\">(k) Other Commission panel awards and remedies. In addition to the other awards and relief which are hereinafter provided, the Commission panel may, in accordance with the standards of proof set forth in Section 27-26, also make the following monetary orders determined by the Commission panel from the evidence of record as the actual damages, costs or losses involved or in such amounts as may be specified below:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-6\">(1) The complainant may be awarded reasonable attorney\u2019s fees. In determining the reasonableness of attorney\u2019s fees claimed by the complainant, the Commission panel shall consider the following factors:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-7\">a. Time and labor required;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-8\">b. The novelty and complexity of the case;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-9\">c. The skill requisite to perform the legal service properly;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-10\">d. The preclusion of other employment by the attorney due to acceptance of the case;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-11\">e. The customary fee;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-12\">f. Whether the fee is fixed or contingent;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-13\">g. Time limitations imposed by the client or the circumstances;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-14\">h. The experience, reputation and ability of the attorneys; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-15\">i. Awards in similar cases.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b337-16\">It is the dispute over the appropriate methodology \u2014 that of lodestar, or that mandated by Montgomery County Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>\u00a7 27-7(k)(1)\u2014for the awarding of attorney\u2019s fees, based on the present facts, that is central to the instant ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">On October 10, 2002, the Panel issued a revised \u201cOrder and Opinion Awarding Attorney\u2019s Fees,\u201d invoking the \u00a7 27 \u20147(k)(1) \u201cfactors [which] encompass what has become known as the \u2018lodestar amount\u2019 \u201d (alteration added). The opinion noted the Panel\u2019s interpretation that \u201cthe remand order did not require us to change the amount of our prior award of attorney\u2019s fees, but merely to explain how we calculated them so that the parties and any Judge reviewing our award could, for themselves, determine its basis.\u201d Under the opinion subheading entitled, \u201cLodestar Analysis Under Section 27\u20147(k)(1) Under the Montgomery [County] Code\u201d (alteration added), the Panel emphasized its discretion under former Montgomery County Code \u00a7 27-1 (f) to \u201cadopt, reverse, modify or remand the recommended decision and order of the hearing examiner\u201d and renewed its decision to reject the hearing examiner\u2019s proposed $120,481.00 award. The Panel found much of the billing to be non-specific and continued, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-5\">\u201cThe Panel has scrutinized the time records involved and read the briefs of both parties, but cannot, with any degree of reliability, determine what tasks were accomplished related to which of the causes of action in this matter. We do not believe that [Mrs. Flaa] and her counsel have met their burden of proof to demonstrate to this Panel what time was spent on the issue of the jurisdiction of the Commission.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">As to bundling of the time entries, the Panel determined that, although bundling may be a frequent practice in legal billing, the quantity of bundling in counsel\u2019s request inhibited the Panel\u2019s ability to \u201cdetermine accurately the amount of time spent and the fees incurred for many tasks.\u201d The Panel stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-7\">\u201c[I]t is not our responsibility to make subjective estimates as to how such entries should be allocated. Moreover, the Panel is comprised of volunteers and does not have access to staff who could spend large amounts of time to attempt to make such estimates, even if the Panel thought it wise to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>attempt to do so, which it does not. For those reasons, we will make the rate percentage cuts in the final award.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">The Panel went on to examine each of the \u00a7 27\u20147(k)(1) criteria, finding as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-5\">\u201cWith respect to time and labor required, the Panel stated that clerical work and inefficient and redundant work had to be excluded from billable time. The Panel determined that \u2018the same task and research were performed by counsel multiple times.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-6\"><em>Flaa, </em>158 Md.App. at 492, 857 A.2d at 609-10. The Panel, dubious that Mrs. Flaa would find it worthwhile to pursue such extensive litigation, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-7\">\u201c[W]e cannot fathom how any person, dealing with the facts alleged, could have decided that it was worth $250,000 or so to litigate these issues. We believe that an attorney has a responsibility to dissuade clients or potential clients from launching costly litigation, knowing that the other party will incur enormous defense costs, where the cost/benefit ratio of that litigation is low. In this case particularly, damages were capped [at $1,000.00] under the statute. Rather, it is our decision on this issue that any reasonable client would not have been willing to spend more than $25,000 to pursue claims of the type made in this proceeding.\u201d [Alterations added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">In addressing the second criterion of \u00a7 27 \u20147(k)(1), the novelty and complexity of the case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-9\">\u201c[T]he Panel credited [Mrs. Flaa] for successfully litigating the jurisdictional issue, which was a case of first impression in Maryland. The Panel also pointed out that [Mrs. Flaa] had presented no evidence that counsel was precluded from other employment while litigating the instant case or that there were strict time limitations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-10\">\u201cNeither the Panel nor [Manor] contested the hourly rates used in calculating attorney\u2019s fees; the Panel therefore deemed the rates reasonable. The Panel decided to make no adjustment relating to the skill required to litigate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>the case, the customary fee for similar cases, or whether the fee was fixed or contingent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-5\">\u201cDespite finding that lead counsel was experienced in this area of the law, the Panel declined to make an upward adjustment on that basis. With respect to awards in similar cases, the Panel found little evidence on that point, but nonetheless described [counsel\u2019s] request for fees as \u2018excessive.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b340-6\"><em>Flaa, </em>158 Md.App. at 493, 857 A.2d at 610 (alterations added).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">Having concluded its examination of the \u00a7 27-7(k)(1) criteria, the Panel addressed the relative success of Mrs. Flaa\u2019s case, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-8\">\u201cWe found some of [Mrs. Flaa\u2019s] major theories and alleged causes of action brought in this case to be without merit and therefore declined to follow the recommendations of the Hearing Examiner on those issues of law. Moreover, in awarding the monetary damages that we did, this Panel was well aware of the fact that there was one (and only one) proven instance of \u2018discrimination.\u2019 We felt compelled by the statute to award injunctive relief, regardless of whether we believed that there were systemic wrongs to be righted. As discussed above, only the argument and decision in favor of finding for the jurisdiction of the Commission was a major victory for [Mrs. Flaa]. As a result, we do not believe that [Mrs. Flaa\u2019s] award of attorney\u2019s fees should be adjusted upward as a result of [the relative success of the case].\u201d [Alterations added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b340-9\">The Panel concluded that \u201c[b]ased on our [l]odestar analysis of all of the factors that we are required to base this ruling upon\u201d (alterations added) Mrs. Flaa should be awarded attorney\u2019s fees of $22,440 which comprised its figure of 132 hours multiplied by the counsel\u2019s average firm billing rate of $170/ hour.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Panel did not award any expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-10\">On November 12, 2002, Mrs. Flaa filed her second petition in the Circuit Court seeking judicial review of the Panel\u2019s October 2002 opinion and order. Manor opposed Mrs. Flaa\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>petition. Mrs. Flaa urged that the Panel had committed an error of law, by failing to consider, <em>inter alia, </em>her degree of success in prevailing on her discrimination claim and that the Panel had erroneously reached its award by applying a cost-benefit analysis.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Following oral argument on June 17, 2003, the judge, ruling from the bench, affirmed the Panel\u2019s October 10, 2002, attorney\u2019s fees award.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">In appealing to the intermediate appellate court, Mrs. Flaa emphasized anew the notion of the Panel\u2019s failure to apply the lodestar approach to the calculation of an award of attorney\u2019s fees, and this issue formed the sole basis of her appeal. She presented to the Court of Special Appeals a single matter of law issue for review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-5\">\u201c \u2018Whether the Montgomery County Circuit Court committed an error of law by affirming the Public Accommodations Panel\u2019s Order and Opinion Awarding Attorney\u2019s Fees, in which the Panel failed to apply the lodestar method in its calculation of attorney\u2019s fees and costs.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-6\"><em>Flaa, </em>158 Md.App. at 486, 857 A.2d at 606.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">In a reported opinion issued September 8, 2004, the Court of Special Appeals vacated the Circuit Court\u2019s decision and directed the matter\u2019s remand to the Panel to \u201cfirst determine the lodestar amount, and, if reductions are made, provide an explanation for the disallowed hours.\u201d <em>Flaa, </em>158 Md.App. at 500, 857 A.2d at 615.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">II.

Lodestar Examined</p>\n<p id=\"b341-9\">We begin by undertaking a brief overview of the much-discussed lodestar approach that, under appropriate circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>stances, may be used to calculate attorney\u2019s fees, when the award of such fees is permitted generally by statute. In this Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Friolo v. Frankel, </em>373 Md. 501, 819 A.2d 354 (2003), filed approximately three months prior to the time respondent sought review in the Court of Special Appeals, Judge Wilner examined at great length the evolution of the lodestar approach and noted the origin of this term. He explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-4\">\u201cThe term \u2018lodestar\u2019 has an Anglo-Saxon origin \u2014 \u2018lad,\u2019 a way or path, and \u2018sterre,\u2019 a star. It thus was a guiding star. <em>See </em>Webster\u2019s Unabridged Dictionary at 1062. It later came to denote a \u2018guiding ideal; a model for imitation.\u2019 <em>Id. </em>At some point, the term began to be applied to the method noted for determining reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-5\"><em>Friolo, </em>373 Md. at 504 n. 1, 819 A.2d at 356 n. 1. The lodestar approach, as applied in Maryland in <em>Friolo, </em>consists of the somewhat elementary formula articulated in <em>Hensley v. Eckerhart, </em>461 U.S. 424, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 76 L.Ed.2d 40 (1983):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Atq\">\u201cThe most useful starting point for determining the amount of a reasonable fee is <em>the number of hours reasonably expended on the litigation multiplied by a reasonable hourly rate. </em>This calculation provides an objective basis on which to make an initial estimate of the value of a lawyer\u2019s services. The party seeking an award of fees should submit evidence supporting the hours worked and rates claimed. Where the documentation of hours is inadequate, the district [trial] court may reduce the award accordingly.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 433, 103 S.Ct. at 1939 (alteration added) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">Respondent compares her status as a \u201csuccessful civil rights complainant\u201d to the situation present in <em>Johnson v. Georgia Highiway Express, Inc., </em>488 F.2d 714 (5th Cir.1974), <em>vacated in part, Blanchard v. Bergeron, </em>489 U.S. 87, 109 S.Ct. 939, 103 L.Ed.2d 67 (1989) <em>(Blanchard, </em>489 U.S. at 93, 109 S.Ct. at 944, noted that \u201ca contingent-fee contract does not impose an automatic ceiling on an award of attorney\u2019s fees, and to hold otherwise would be inconsistent with the statute [Civil Rights <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>Attorney\u2019s Fees Awards Act, 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1988] and its policy and purpose\u201d (alteration added)). In <em>Johnson, </em>a case arising from an interlocutory appeal by plaintiffs who had brought a Title VII action alleging racial discrimination in their employment, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit promulgated a number of factors, later adopted by the Supreme Court in <em>Hensley, </em>to apply in exercising the court\u2019s discretion when awarding attorney\u2019s fees against a party in a civil rights action:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-4\">\u201c(1) <em>The time and labor required. </em>... (2) <em>The novelty and difficulty of the questions. </em>... (3) <em>The skill requisite to perform the legal service properly. </em>... (4) <em>The preclusion of other employment by the attorney due to acceptance of the case. </em>... (5) <em>The customary fee. </em>... (6) <em>Whether the fee is fixed or contingent. </em>... (7) <em>Time limitations imposed by the client or the circumstances. </em>... (8) <em>The amount involved and the results obtained </em>[This is a cost-benefit standard.].... (9) <em>The experience, reputation, and ability of the attorneys. ... </em>(10) <em>The \u2018undesirability\u2019 of the case. ... </em>(11) <em>The nature and length of the professional relationship with the client. ... </em>(12) <em>Awards in similar cases.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b343-5\"><em>Johnson, </em>488 F.2d at 717-19 (alteration added). Clearly, the factors in <em>Johnson </em>are, in large part, comparable to the factors of Montgomery County Code \u00a7 27-7(k)(1). <em>Johnson </em>also stated that \u201c[t]he reasonableness of the award is to be judged by the abuse of discretion standard of review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 717.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">This Court in <em>Admiral Mortgage, Inc. v. Cooper, </em>357 Md. 533, 745 A.2d 1026 (2000) (stating in dicta that an employee from whom the employer had withheld commissions was entitled to collect attorney\u2019s fees, and since there were no criteria contained in the fee-shifting statute for the court to determine the amount of fees, the lodestar method served as the proper basis for the judge\u2019s calculation of the attorney\u2019s fees award) noted the logic of having the judge, rather than a jury, determine the attorney\u2019s fees and provided some other criteria for analysis under the lodestar approach, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>\u201cIn the Federal system, attorneys\u2019 fees awarded under fee-shifting statutes are calculated in accordance with the \u2018lodestar\u2019 approach \u2014 the product of reasonable hours times a reasonable rate. <em>Burlington v. Dague, </em>505 U.S. 557, 112 S.Ct. 2638, 120 L.Ed.2d 449 (1992). The determination of those two items, however, involves a number of factors that are both subjective and judgmental. In Maryland, they would include consideration of the factors set forth in Rule 1.5 of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct, among which are \u2018the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved\u2019 and \u2018the skill requisite to perform the legal service properly.\u2019 Those factors are more judgmental than fact-based and are more apt to be within the expertise of a judge rather than of lay jurors.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-4\"><em>Admiral Mortgage, Inc., </em>357 Md. at 552-53, 745 A.2d at 1036 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">B. Standard of Review<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">As a threshold matter, the parties also disagree on the approach we are to take in reviewing the intermediate appellate court\u2019s conclusion that the Panel \u201cdid not properly apply the lodestar approach.\u201d <em>Flaa, </em>158 Md.App. at 495, 857 A.2d at 611. Citing her belief that the Panel\u2019s failure to employ the lodestar approach is an error of law, Mrs. Flaa urges that we undertake a <em>de novo </em>review of the Panel\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees determination. She references our opinion in <em>Caucus Distributors, Inc. v. Maryland Securities Com\u2019r, </em>320 Md. 313, 577 A.2d 783 (1990), wherein we stated that an agency\u2019s fact-finding and inferences are entitled to deference, but \u201c[wjhen, however, the agency\u2019s decision is predicated solely on an error of law, no deference is appropriate and the reviewing court may substitute its judgment for that of the agency.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>324, 577 A.2d at 788. <em>See also Washington Nat\u2019l Arena v. Comptroller, </em>308 Md. 370, 378-79, 519 A.2d 1277 (1987); <em>Ramsay, Scarlett &amp; Co. v. Comptroller, </em>302 Md. 825, 490 A.2d 1296 (1985). On the other hand, Manor contends that the Panel\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees review, undertaken according to the factors of Montgomery County Code \u00a7 27-7(k)(l), was appropriate and Manor suggests that our evaluation should be deferential, recognizing that \u201can administrative agency\u2019s interpretation and application of the statute which the agency administers should ordinarily be given considerable weight by reviewing courts.\u201d <em>Board of Physician Quality Assur. v. Banks, </em>354 Md. 59, 69, 729 A.2d 376, 381 (1999); <em>see also Lussier v. Maryland Racing Commission, </em>343 Md. 681, 696-697, 684 A.2d 804, 811-812 (1996). Thus, although not luminously articulated, it seems that Manor is suggesting that the Panel did apply a lodestar approach in some fashion, but that approach was in conformance with the standards described in Montgomery County Code \u00a7 27-7(k)(1), and we should leave the decision of the Panel untouched if we find that the Panel did not abuse its discretion, <em>i.e., </em>it had substantial evidence to support its attorney\u2019s fees award. As we have previously stated, \u201c[a] court\u2019s role is limited to determining if there is substantial evidence in the record as a whole to support the agency\u2019s findings and conclusions, and to determine if the administrative decision is premised upon an erroneous conclusion of law.\u201d <em>United Parcel Serv., Inc. v. People\u2019s Counsel, </em>336 Md. 569, 577, 650 A.2d 226, 230 (1994), <em>quoted in Bucktail, LLC v. County Council, </em>352 Md. 530, 552-53, 723 A.2d 440, 450 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">We were confronted with similarly competing arguments in <em>Friolo. </em>In <em>Friolo, </em>a case in which this Court was called upon to evaluate whether the lodestar approach was the appropriate methodology to calculate the award of attorney\u2019s fees in a case litigated under the Maryland Wage and Hour Law, Md.Code (1991, 1999 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7\u00a7 3-401 <em>et seq. </em>of the Labor and Employment Article and under the Wage Payment and Collection Law, Md.Code (1991, 1999 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7\u00a7 3-501 <em>et seq. </em>of the Labor and Employment Article, we determined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>that awarding a fee was a permitted, discretionary act,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> thus mooting the argument of legal error in respect to that issue. Contrary to <em>the Friolo </em>petitioner\u2019s urging that this Court in <em>Admiral Mortgage, Inc. v. Cooper, </em>357 Md. 533, 745 A.2d 1026, had \u201c \u2018strongly suggested\u2019 that Maryland courts follow the lodestar approach,\u201d <em>Friolo, </em>373 Md. at 518, 819 A.2d at 364, we determined in <em>Friolo </em>that, although lodestar was the correct approach in the <em>Friolo </em>case, application of lodestar is a fact-sensitive endeavor:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-5\">\u201c[T]he lodestar approach is <em>ordinarily </em>the appropriate one to use in determining a reasonable counsel fee. We stress, however, that the approach we approve is broader than simply hours spent times hourly rate but also includes careful consideration of appropriate adjustments to that product, which, in almost all instances, will be case-specific.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A5V\"><em>Id. </em>at 505, 819 A.2d at 356 (emphasis added). Accordingly, our <em>Friolo </em>holding did not establish lodestar as the only approach for calculation of an award of attorney\u2019s fees in Maryland cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">In the instant case, we similarly find it unnecessary to further the debate as to whether the Court of Special Appeals\u2019s decision should have examined the lower court\u2019s decision for error of law or abuse of discretion. As we have indicated, and as we shall explain, the use of the lodestar approach, under the circumstances of the instant case, was unnecessary, given the presence of the Montgomery County Code \u00a7 27-7(k)(1) criteria. As we explain further, the Panel\u2019s invocation \u2014 and subsequent analysis of those criteria, following the earlier remand, was generally sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">C. Attorney\u2019s Fees Methodology</p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">We continue our explanation by examining whether, even in light of the \u00a7 27\u20147(k)(1) criteria, the Panel was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>required to use lodestar to determine an attorney\u2019s fees award. That is, we must determine whether lodestar can preempt a similar methodology or scheme set out in a local code. We first note, again, that the American Rule generally applies in Maryland, except when a fee-shifting statute or a contractual provision to the contrary exists.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The American Rule is the Maryland common-law rule. Generally, the lodestar rule is one method of calculation when a statute trumps the common-law rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">The Court of Special Appeals determined that the Panel\u2019s failure to arrive at an initial lodestar figure was erroneous. That court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-5\">\u201cAs we review the Panel\u2019s decision, we observe preliminarily that there is no indication how, if at all, the Panel calculated the lodestar before considering the adjustment factors. Calculation of the lodestar, however, is the first step in the lodestar analysis. That fact alone leads us to conclude that the Panel committed legal error in calculating the fee award and that the case must be remanded for a determination of the lodestar.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-6\"><em>Flaa, </em>158 Md.App. at 497, 857 A.2d at 612-18.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">Manor contends, however, that, under the facts of the instant case, instead of a lodestar method, Montgomery County Code \u00a7 27-7(k)(1) governs the calculation of any attorney\u2019s fees that the Panel may, in its discretion, award in this case. Manor states that \u201cunder this Montgomery County Code provision, no precise, mathematical, formulaic application of the \u2018lodestar amount\u2019 is required since the statute itself ensures that a Panel adhering to the statute <em>ivill </em>include a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>determination of reasonable hours in its consideration of reasonable attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d Manor urges that the Court of Special Appeals was incorrect in holding that its inability to \u201cdetermine whether the Panel <em>first </em>established a lodestar figure, prior to reviewing the factors set forth in the Montgomery County Code, [leads to the conclusion that] the Panel erred as a matter of law.\u201d Manor summarizes its argument as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-4\">\u201cWhether we say that the Panel determined the \u2018reasonable hours\u2019 by evaluating the \u2018time and labor required\u2019 factor of the [\u00a7 ] 27-7(k)(1) factors, or we say that, in computing the lodestar figure the Panel determined that it was reasonable to spend 132 hours on the jurisdictional issue, but then, applying the factors from <em>Friolo </em>and <em>Hensley, </em>determined that no upward or downward adjustment of that number is necessary, the only difference is a matter of semantics.\u201d [Alteration added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">Mrs. Flaa, on the other hand, argues to this Court that any award of attorney\u2019s fees under civil rights legislation must be comprised of a two-step process: First, the calculating and awarding entity \u2014 whether an administrative body or a court\u2014 <em>must </em>determine a lodestar, <em>i.e., </em>the product of a reasonable number of hours expended on the case multiplied by a reasonable hourly fee. Next, the calculating and awarding entity <em>may </em>adjust the lodestar-derived figure upward or downward based upon the application of adjustment factors such as those prescribed in Montgomery County Code \u00a7 27-7(k)(1) or such as those delineated in <em>Johnson </em>and adopted by <em>Hensley. </em>Thus, according to respondent, the Court of Special Appeals was correct in its finding that the Panel\u2019s failure to arrive at an initial lodestar number was a repudiation of the case law, and thus, an error of law, and not simply an option within the discretion of the calculating and awarding entity.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">Respondent further argues that \u00a7 27-7(k)(1) cannot be considered either the functional equivalent or an acceptable substitute for the lodestar method because the \u00a7 27\u20147(k)(1) criteria address only the \u201csecond, and far less important, part\u201d of the lodestar test, <em>i.e., </em>guidelines by which to increase or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>decrease an already lodestar-calculated attorney\u2019s fees award. Thus, according to respondent, the so-called \u201csecondary adjustment factors\u201d contained in the MCOHR\u2019s former fee-shifting provision did not abolish the requirement that the Panel employ the lodestar approach because:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-5\">\u201c(i) the county statute is incomplete on its face in that it does not require the Panel to begin its analysis with a calculation of \u2018reasonable hours times reasonable rate\u2019 and is missing important lodestar \u2018adjustment factors\u2019; and (ii) the county statute does not reflect legislative intent to preempt or supersede common law.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">Our review of the considerable procedural history of this case reveals that Mrs. Flaa did not urge the application of the lodestar approach until such time as she filed her first petition for judicial review in the circuit court. Nevertheless, respondent suggests that <em>Friolo </em>should govern the award of attorney\u2019s fees under fee-shifting statutes in Maryland and she urges this Court to extend its <em>Friolo </em>holding, which applied the lodestar method to the fee-shifting statutes invoked in that case, to the matter before us. She observes that her case is a particularly worthy candidate for a lodestar calculation given its civil rights genre and the apparent novelty of its issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">Manor contends that <em>Friolo </em>does not stand for the proposition that attorney\u2019s fees can be calculated <em>only </em>upon the calculation initially of a total number of hours multiplied by an hourly rate. Rather, according to Manor, <em>Friolo </em>indicates that, in the absence of other statutory criteria for calculating an attorney\u2019s fees award, one must begin with a lodestar figure, <em>i.e., </em>a result obtained by multiplying a number of hours by an hourly rate. In the present case, Manor contends that the presence of the Montgomery County Code \u00a7 27-7(k)(1) criteria renders use of the lodestar method unnecessary, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>the Panel\u2019s application of the Montgomery County Code criteria pursuant to the circuit court\u2019s mandate has resulted in a properly-determined discretionary award of attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">We determine, under the circumstances of the present case, that the criteria of \u00a7 27-7(k)(1) are the proper method by which to determine reasonable attorney\u2019s fees. Respondent has clearly misunderstood the thrust of our <em>Friolo </em>decision. By virtue of this Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Friolo, </em>we did not mandatorily \u201cadopt a lodestar approach ... as a matter of Maryland law\u201d <em>id. </em>at 520, 819 A.2d at 366, for all situations. Rather, our language articulated in <em>Friolo </em>applied lodestar to Md.Code (1991, 1999 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7\u00a7 3-427 and 3-507.1 of the Labor and Employment Article, and indicated a general approval of the approach in conjunction with other fee-shifting statutes that provide for the possible award of attorney\u2019s fees, but lack criteria for how to calculate such fees. <em>Friolo, </em>373 Md. at 504-05, 819 A.2d at 356. <em>Friolo </em>did not preclude the use of criteria other than those found in <em>Johnson; Hensley; </em>Rule 1.5 of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct, or others.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">In the present matter, the case-specific facts indicate that at the time the Panel elected to make an attorney\u2019s fees award, legislative directions existed in Montgomery County Code \u00a7 27-7(k)(1), which were required to be considered in arriving at an award amount. Accordingly, these criteria formed the basis of the Panel\u2019s award consideration, and in basing its award on these criteria, the Panel did not act contrary to <em>Friolo. </em>Thus, <em>Friolo </em>remains intact as to those cases for which it is applicable. Mandatory legislative criteria, where they exist, for the setting of fee-shifted awards, are entirely appropriate for determining an award of attorney\u2019s fees, and in such circumstances, are to be utilized. In such instances where a statute creates the right to fee-shifting and contains criteria for the setting of such fees, the statutory criteria are to be invoked primarily; not as adjustment factors after the determination of some initial, foundational number under a lodestar approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>As a final matter, we note that respondent has observed that Montgomery County has replaced the entirety of Montgomery County Code \u00a7 27 7(k)(1) with Montgomery County Code \u00a7 27-8(a)(1)(A) which provides simply for the award of \u201creasonable attorney\u2019s fees\u201d upon a finding of a violation of the County\u2019s Human Rights article. Montgomery County\u2019s ordinance change is noteworthy only for its prospective effect. The change does not alter the result in this case, as the Panel made its initial attorney\u2019s fees determination in 2000, prior to the repeal of Montgomery County Code \u00a7 27\u20147(k)(1), which occurred in 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">The criteria in former Montgomery County Code \u00a7 27-7(k)(l) make unnecessary the use of a lodestar approach for calculating the attorney\u2019s fees awarded to a successful claimant under Montgomery County\u2019s Commission on Human Rights Article. The Panel\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees calculation made pursuant to an analysis of each of the criterion contained in the former \u00a7 27-7(k)(1) resulted in a properly-determined award of attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH DIRECTION TO AFFIRM THE JUNE 30, 2003 JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY; COSTS IN THIS COURT AND THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS TO BE PAID BY RESPONDENT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b330-8\">.

That claim, to which she later added a claim for sex discrimination, alleged that the petitioner\u2019s policies with respect to access to and use of its golf course were discriminatory on the basis of marital status and resulted in disparate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>treatment of women, in general and her, in particular, because of sex. She also asserted theories of disparate impact against women in the membership structure and a hostile environment for them in the petitioner\u2019s indoor restaurant.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">The respondent substantially prevailed on her claims. While, to be sure, the MCOHR panel did not adopt all of the findings and conclusions of the hearing examiner<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> assigned to conduct the hearing in the case, it did adopt the most significant, the foundational one, that Manor Country Club is a place of public accommodation. The Panel also agreed that the petitioner had engaged in the act of sex discrimination against the respondent that the hearing examiner had identified. Having made those findings, it ordered the petitioner \u201cto cease and desist from all activities and conduct that discriminate against women;\u201d \u201cto establish a formal and written policy against discrimination against women in the use of any facilities, services and activities of the club;\u201d \u201cto provide for a confidential and unbiased procedure for filing complaints of discrimination;\u201d and \u201cto provide reasonable access for [MCOHR] staff to monitor compliance with [its] order.\u201d As the hearing examiner had done, although in lesser amounts, the panel awarded the respondent monetary damages and attorney\u2019s fees. Rather than the maximum damages of $1,000 recommended by the hearing examiner, the panel awarded the petitioner $750.00 in damages, and significantly reduced the $120,481 in attorney\u2019s fees recommended, awarding the petitioner only $3,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">The Circuit Court for Montgomery County having reversed the attorney\u2019s fee award, noting that it was arrived at without regard to the factors enumerated in Montgomery County Code, \u00a7 27\u20147(k)(1) (1987)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and without refuting the findings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>supporting his fee recommendation, made by the hearing examiner, and remanded the case for a redetermination of the award, the panel issued its Order and Opinion Awarding Attorney\u2019s Fees. In its Opinion, the panel addressed each of the \u00a7 27-7(k)(1) factors, concluding, in the Order, to award attorney\u2019s fees of $22,440, \u201c[b]ased on our Lodestar analysis of all of the factors that we are required to base this ruling upon.\u201d That amount was calculated on the basis of 132 hours multiplied by the average firm billing rate, $170 per hour, of the petitioner\u2019s counsel. In considering, as it was instructed to do, the degree of success the outcome represented for the petitioner, the panel observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-5\">\u201cWe found some of [the respondent\u2019s] major theories and alleged causes of action brought in this case to be without merit and therefore declined to follow the recommendations of the Hearing Examiner on those issues of law. Moreover, in awarding the monetary damages that we did, this Panel was well aware of the fact that there was one (and only one) proven instance of \u2018discrimination.\u2019 We felt compelled by the statute to award injunctive relief, regardless of whether we believed that there were systemic wrongs to be righted. As discussed above, only the argument and decision in favor of finding for the jurisdiction of the Commission was a major victory for [the respondent].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">Accordingly, not believing the degree of success the respondent enjoyed to have been significant, the panel declined to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>adjust the attorney\u2019s fees upward. Earlier, when addressing the time and labor factor, the panel had commented, tellingly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Arm\">\u201cWe cannot fathom how any person, dealing with the facts alleged, could have decided that it was worth $250,000 or so to litigate these issues. We believe that an attorney has a responsibility to dissuade clients or potential clients from launching costly litigation, knowing that the other party will incur enormous defense costs, where the cost/benefit ratio of that litigation is low. In this case particularly, damages were capped under the statute. Rather, it is our decision on this issue that any reasonable client would not have been willing to spend more than $25,000 to pursue claims of the type made in this proceeding.\u201d [Alterations Added]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">I have not the slightest doubt that the panel erred in its determination of the attorney\u2019s fees in this case and that, as the Court of Special Appeals held, the Circuit Court erred in affirming that award. As the Circuit Court on initial review noted, although the respondent did not prevail on her claims of hostile environment and disparate impact, she prevailed on a matter of first impression in Maryland, her claim that Manor Country Club was a place of public accommodation, and on her claim of sex discrimination. Moreover, whatever might have been the motivation of the panel in awarding it, the respondent obtained the injunctive relief she sought, which relief benefited, in any event, not just the respondent, but all women using any of the petitioner\u2019s \u201cfacilities, services and activities.\u201d Furthermore, this discrimination matter has taken more than ten years to resolve, without regard to the appeal concerning the attorney\u2019s fees, the fees as to which are also recoverable by the prevailing party. Like the Court of Special Appeals, I am unable to understand the reason for, or discern support for, \u201can 89 percent reduction in hours in a case in which the party seeking attorney\u2019s fees prevailed on two of its four claims and one of those claims was a matter of first impression.\u201d <em>Flaa v. Manor Country Club, </em>158 Md.App. 483, 498, 857 A.2d 604, 613 (2004). It is even more perplexing when it is recalled that the respondent was awarded an amount equal to three-quarters of the maximum damages allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>It is absolutely clear to me that the panel did precisely what the Circuit Court, on initial review, surmised that it had done, engaged in and applied a cost-benefit analysis. Such an approach, because it requires the attorney\u2019s fee award to be proportional to the monetary judgment award, is inconsistent with the purpose of the ordinance, to allow, not discourage, access to the courts for meritorious, though small, in terms of actual damages, claims. <em>See City of Riverside v. Rivera, </em>477 U.S. 561, 577, 106 S.Ct. 2686, 2695, 91 L.Ed.2d 466, 482 (1986) (\u201c[a] rule of proportionality would make it difficult, if not impossible, for individuals with meritorious civil rights claims but relatively small potential damages to obtain redress from the courts. This is totally inconsistent with Congress\u2019 purpose in enacting [42 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1988.\u201d); <em>Blaylock v. Johns Hopkins Fed. Credit Union, </em>152 Md.App. 338, 356, 831 A.2d 1120, 1130 (2003). <em>See also Bittner v. Tri-County Toyota, Inc., </em>58 Ohio St.3d 143, 569 N.E.2d 464, 466 (1991), in which the Ohio Supreme Court offered another argument against proportionality:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-4\">\u201cIn addition to addressing an individual wrong, pursuing a claim under the Act may produce a benefit to the community generally. A judgment for the consumer in such a case may discourage violations of the Act by others. Prohibiting private attorneys from recovering for the time they expend on a consumer protection case undermines both the purpose and deterrent effect of the Act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">The validity of that argument is not at all affected by the fact that the statute at issue in that case was a consumer protection statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">I dissent.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b352-6\">. The hearing examiner found that Manor Country Club was a place of public accommodation; that the petitioner had engaged in one instance of sex discrimination, by treating her right of access to use of the golf course disparately; and that the petitioner had engaged in gender-based discriminatory practices, creating a hostile environment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b352-7\">. Section 27-7(k)(1) of the Montgomery County Code, as in effect when this case was decided, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>\"The complainant may be awarded reasonable attorney\u2019s fees.

I am aware that the respondent did not cross-appeal on the issue of whether the panel improperly applied a cost benefit analysis and that, although going to some pains to frame it, the Court of Special Appeals purported not to reach the merits of that issue. Nevertheless, I believe it would be putting form over substance to overlook the thrust, the real substance, of the intermediate appellate court\u2019s analysis.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
