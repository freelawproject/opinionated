Goff with a number of crimes, including, <em>inter alia, </em>burglary, assault, trespass, and malicious destruction of property, resulting from an incident occurring on February 28, 2003, at the apartment of Patrick Hadley. On August 19, 2003, Mr. Goff entered a plea of not guilty in the Circuit Court for Carroll County and proceeded on an agreed statement of facts. The court found him guilty of second-degree assault and trespass.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The State dismissed the remaining counts. The court ordered Mr. Goff to pay a fine in the amount of $150.00 for the trespass. In addition, the court sentenced Mr. Goff to eighteen-months incarceration for the assault, suspended that sentence, and placed him on two years of supervised probation. The court also ordered, as a condition of probation, that Mr. Goff pay restitution in an amount to be determined. Months later, the court held a hearing on restitution, and on February 17, 2004, ordered Mr. Goff to pay $2,156.00 to Patrick Hadley, the victim of the assault. Mr. Goff appealed to the Court of Special Appeals. On December 17, 2004, before the case was heard in the Court of Special Appeals, we granted <em>certiorari </em>on our own initiative. <em>Goff v. State, </em>384 Md. 448, 863 A.2d 997 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-10\">The only question before us is whether the Circuit Court\u2019s order of restitution was proper. We hold that the court did not err by ordering Mr. Goff to pay restitution to the victim of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>the assault because the damage to property was a direct result of the assault and the victim was responsible for repairing the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">As previously noted, the parties proceeded on an agreed statement of facts, which included, in pertinent part, the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-7\">Your Honor, had the State proceeded to trial, we would have also called Officer Warehime and he would have testified that, on Friday, February 28th of 2003, at approximately 12:44 a.m., he responded to the address of 3181 Main Street, in Manchester, Carroll County, State of Maryland, for an assault in progress.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-8\">Upon arrival, he observed the Defendant, James Paul Goff, standing on the porch of that address. Previously, Goff had been advised that he was not to be at that home and had been notified by the lessee, who is Patrick Hadley, not to come onto the property. Officer Warehime had been present ... and had advised the Defendant that he would be arrested next time the Officer had seen the Defendant at that address.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-9\">At that time, Officer Warehime spoke with Patrick Michael Hadley, the lessee of the property. Hadley stated that Goff knocked down the door and demanded to see Hadley\u2019s then girlfriend, Dana Karen Barnes, also known as Dana Smith. Hadley then stated that he told Goff to go away. Goff then forced his way into his apartment ... and began to strike Hadley repeatedly with a closed fist. Hadley further stated that Goff was pushing him around the living room and that they ended up in the bathroom. Hadley stated that Goff had pinned him in the shower where he struck him several times in the face. Officer Warehime saw that Hadley had a bloody face and <em>that the shower insert in the bathroom had been broken due to the assault.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b362-10\">(Emphasis added.) Before reciting those facts, the State informed the court that, \u201c[o]ur recommendation would be to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>defer to the [c]ourt, ask for restitution for the shower, and ask for no contact with Patrick Hadley or Dana Smith.... \u201d In addition, after the court found Mr. Goff guilty, defense counsel noted that Mr. Goff was \u201cwilling to make restitution. I\u2019m assuming at some point the State ... will get us a figure on that[.] [I]t was one of these shower inserts that got cracked and we need ... some sort of statement on that.\u201d The trial judge ordered that, \u201c[djefendant is to pay restitution in an amount to be determined. I\u2019ll give the State thirty days to submit restitution figures. In the event that the figure is disputed, of course, we can have a hearing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">The parties disagreed about the figure and on February 11, 2004, the court held a hearing on restitution. Defense counsel noted at the start of the hearing that Mr. Goff agreed to pay restitution, \u201cwith the understanding that it was five hundred dollars, or less.\u201d The State called Mr. Hadley to the stand who testified that he rented the apartment in which the assault took place. Mr. Hadley described the damage to the shower as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-6\">There\u2019s [sic] numerous holes and cracks all through the side of the shower. The panels that are glued on to either side of the shower that are like two by two, they\u2019ve popped off and I cannot reattach them. I have \u2014 right now, to keep the water damage down, I have duct tape and trash bags hanging over the holes to keep the water from going through the shower.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">He also testified that the damage occurred as a result of the fight and that he had not yet fixed the shower because he did not have the money to do so. The State introduced an estimate of the cost to replace the shower in the amount of $2,156, obtained by Mr. Hadley from Cat\u00f3n Plumbing. The written estimate, signed by an estimator named Kevin Ohl, did not differentiate between costs of labor and materials but did provide a list of materials needed and work expected to be completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">Mr. Hadley testified that he obtained the estimate from Cat\u00f3n Plumbing because he worked for that company and it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>was convenient.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He also testified that he reported the shower damage to his landlord, who did not replace it because he considered it Mr. Hadley\u2019s responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">Mr. Goff also testified at the hearing on February 11. He stated that he earned $14.00 per hour as a carpenter and that he could not afford to pay the estimated cost to replace the shower. Mr. Goff attempted to testify about the cost of a fiberglass shower wall kit that he saw at Lowe\u2019s. The State objected and the court continued the hearing to give Mr. Goff an opportunity to obtain his own written estimate of the cost to replace the shower.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">When the hearing resumed on February 17, Mr. Goff testified that he had obtained an estimate from Lowe\u2019s for the cost of a \u201csurround kit.\u201d Lowe\u2019s estimated the cost of the kit as $111.30. Mr. Goff also testified that he obtained an estimate for the cost of repairing the shower from a contractor, Mr. Blizzard of \u201cB. D. Blizzard Construction,\u201d in the total amount of $513.00, including $88.00 for the shower kit and $425.00 for labor. The estimate obtained from Mr. Blizzard was handwritten on a generic invoice, without letterhead, and was signed by Mr. Blizzard. Mr. Goff admitted on cross-examination that he did not know if Mr. Blizzard was a licensed plumber.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">The State called Kevin Ohl as a rebuttal witness. He testified that he was a plumbing estimator for Cat\u00f3n Plumbing and that he had held that position for ten years. He also testified that the estimate from Lowe\u2019s was for a \u201cshower and wall set\u201d and that there was no listing of a base or the actual wall kit itself.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He also mentioned that the Lowe\u2019s estimate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>did not account for replacement of the green wall board or replacement of the drain and some of the piping. In view of the fact that the shower was very old, Mr. Ohl testified that he expected the repair to include stripping the shower down to the studs, putting up waterproof sheetrock, and then installing the new shower.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He testified that he believed it would take ten to twelve hours to complete the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">Regarding the estimate provided by Mr. Blizzard, Mr. Ohl testified that it did not account for a sufficient amount of hours of work to replace the shower.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In addition, Mr. Ohl testified that a competitive hourly rate for plumbing work is $122.00 per hour and that the Blizzard estimate included an hourly rate of approximately $50.00 per hour. Moreover, the Blizzard estimate contained no mark up on the supplies needed to replace the shower. Mr. Ohl concluded that Mr. Blizzard would be \u201closing a lot money\u201d if he completed the work at the price estimated.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>At the conclusion of the hearing, the trial judge ordered restitution in the amount of $2,156.00 and made the following remarks:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-5\">Well, I guess the thing is, I think there was some testimony-last week that the thing simply could not be repaired. Numerous cracks and holes, which were a direct result of the incident which led to Mr. Goff being convicted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-6\">H* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-7\">Here what we have is an item which was probably, prior to the incident, perfectly functional and after the incident, it\u2019s not functional ... it\u2019s not the value of the shower stall here, it\u2019s the value of the materials and services needed to replace it because it\u2019s no longer functional and I think the testimony, the last time, was adequate to establish that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-8\">So, then, the issue is, what is a fair amount of restitution, assuming that the item has to be replaced ... it is the burden of the Defendant to show that the suggested charges by the State are not fair and reasonable and that I think the Defendant has \u2014 has not met his burden. I think that, based upon what we \u2014 we have heard over both hearings, I \u2014 I think that, although it sounds like a lot of money, anytime you have damage to something in a home which is going to require some degree of labor, it doesn\u2019t take very long to run up a \u2014 a total, which is probably going to be more than the home owner expects.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-9\">Now, one of the questions that I had in this case was, is the tenant \u2014 and everybody seems to be operating under the assumption that \u2014 in a situation like this, that it\u2019s necessarily the tenant\u2019s responsibility \u2014 well, the landlord appears to believe that it\u2019s the tenant\u2019s responsibility. Actually, I think there\u2019s an argument that can be made that it\u2019s not the tenant who is really the victim; it\u2019s the landlord who \u2014 who\u2019s the victim, since he\u2019s the property owner and anytime the property owner has damage to his property \u2014 of course, I can understand the landlord taking the position saying, well, I\u2019m not the one that has to use the shower. I\u2019ll just lay it in the lap of the tenant and let him collect on my behalf. And,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>I guess I can\u2019t argue with the logic, but I think there is certainly an argument that can be made that perhaps the landlord is responsible for repairing it and perhaps he\u2019s the one who\u2019s entitled to restitution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-5\">Mr. Hadley seems to take the position that he believes it\u2019s his responsibility and that he ought to, you know, take care of it. One thing that concerned me, quite honestly, is suppose the money is paid by Mr. Goff and the property never gets repaired. Suppose Mr. Hadley moves out at some point in time and the property never is repaired and then is the \u2014 could the landlord come back, potentially sue Mr. Goff as a person who perpetrated this and Mr. Goff would have paid the money in restitution to Mr. Hadley. So, I\u2019m assuming that any money paid here will be used for the intended purpose.... I would not be happy to learn that that didn\u2019t happen....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-6\">I think the \u2014 the estimate, taking everything in consideration provided at the last hearing is \u2014 is fair and reasonable and I order restitution in that amount [$2,156.00].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">The court ordered payment of the restitution through the Division of Parole and Probation and full payment no later than October 20, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"Abl\">Md. Rule 8-131(c) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-9\">When an action has been tried without a jury, the appellate court \"will review the case on both the law and the evidence. It will not set aside the judgment of the trial court on the evidence unless clearly erroneous, and will give due regard to the opportunity of the trial court to judge the credibility of the witnesses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-10\">The issue raised in this case involves a review of the facts found by the trial judge as well as the interpretation of a statute. Our review of the statute is <em>de novo. </em>As noted in <em>Nesbit v. Government Employees Insurance Company, </em>382 Md. 65, 854 A.2d 879 (2004):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>The deference shown to the trial court\u2019s factual findings under the clearly erroneous standard does not, of course, apply to legal conclusions. When the trial court\u2019s [decision] \u201cinvolves an interpretation and application of Maryland statutory and case law, our Court must determine whether the lower court\u2019s conclusions are legally correct under a <em>de novo </em>standard of review.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b368-4\"><em>Nesbit, </em>382 Md. at 72, 854 A.2d at 883 (internal citations omitted). We will not disturb the judgment on the facts, however, unless the trial court\u2019s findings are clearly erroneous. \u201c \u2018If there is any competent evidence to support the factual findings of the trial court, those findings cannot be held to be clearly erroneous.\u2019 \u201d <em>Solomon v. Solomon, </em>383 Md. 176, 202, 857 A.2d 1109, 1123 (2004) (quoting <em>Fuge v. Fuge, </em>146 Md.App. 142, 180, 806 A.2d 716, 738 (2002)).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">As very recently discussed in <em>Williams v. State, </em>385 Md. 50, 867 A.2d 305 (2005),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-7\">\u201cRestitution imposed under [\u00a7 11-603 of the Criminal Procedure Article] \u201cis a <em>criminal sanction, </em>not a civil remedy.\u201d <em>Grey v. Allstate Insurance Company, </em>363 Md. 445, 451, 769 A.2d 891, 895 (2001) (emphasis in original). Judge Wilner, writing for this Court in <em>Grey, </em>traced the history of restitution and explained that it serves retributive, deterrent, and rehabilitative objectives, which are the principal functions of criminal punishment. <em>Id. </em>at 459-60, 769 A.2d at 899-900. We explained that penal goals are accomplished through restitution to the extent that the defendant is forced to focus on the harm that was caused to the victim. <em>Grey, </em>363 Md. at 459, 769 A.2d at 899. Likewise, restitution is a monetary detriment to the defendant and \u201csatisfies] society\u2019s demand for meaningful justice,\u201d thus serving the punitive objective of the criminal system.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b368-8\"><em>Williams, </em>385 Md. at 58-59, 867 A.2d at 310 (footnote omitted) (quoting <em>State v. Garnett, </em>384 Md. 466, 475, 863 A.2d 1007, 1012 (some internal citations omitted)). Restitution may be imposed as a condition of probation or as part of a sentence. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number><em>Pete v. State, </em>384 Md. 47, 55, 862 A.2d 419, 423 (2004); <em>Garnett, </em>384 Md. at 476, 863 A.2d at 1013.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">Mr. Goff argues that the trial court erred by ordering restitution for three reasons: (1) the damage to the shower is not the direct result of the crime; (2) the shower is not the property of the victim; and (3) ordering replacement instead of repair is not fair and reasonable. We begin by discussing the State\u2019s contention that Mr. Goffs first two grounds for attacking the restitution order are not preserved for our review because defense counsel never raised them below. The State points out that Mr. Goff agreed to pay restitution and that the parties proceeded on an agreed statement of facts that included the following description: \u201cOfficer Warehime saw that Hadley had a bloody face and that the shower insert in the bathroom had been broken <em>due to the assault.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Mr. Goffs brief does not address the preservation question. In oral argument, however, counsel argued that a defendant cannot agree to an illegal sentence and that, therefore, the question is properly before the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">As stated in Md. Rule 8-131(a), \u201c[ojrdinarily, we will not decide any other issue unless it plainly appears by the record to have been raised in or decided by the trial court, but the Court may decide such an issue if necessary or desirable to guide the trial court or to avoid the expense and delay of another appeal.\u201d We note at the outset that it appears the issue was \u201craised in or decided by the trial court.\u201d Defense counsel did object at trial to the reasonableness of the amount of restitution ordered by the trial court, properly placing the review of the restitution order before us. Moreover, it is clear from the trial court\u2019s opinion on the record that the specific question of whether Mr. Hadley was the victim of the property damage was considered and decided by the trial court, even if not argued by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">If the issues in this case had not been reviewed by the trial court, we would still consider Mr. Goffs appeal. As stated in <em>Walczak v. State, </em>302 Md. 422, 427, 488 A.2d 949, 951 (1985):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>[W]hen the trial court has allegedly imposed a sentence not permitted by law, the issue should ordinarily be reviewed on direct appeal even if no objection was made in the trial court.... Thus, a defendant who fails to object to the imposition of an illegal sentence does not waive forever his right to challenge that sentence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">Aii order to pay restitution as a condition of probation is part of the punishment for the crime. Walczak, 302 Md. at 426, n. 1, 488 A.2d 949. As such, \u201can illegal condition of probation can be challenged as an illegal sentence.\u201d <em>Id</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">\n<em>The Direct Results of the Crime</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">In support of his argument that the damage to the shower was not a direct result of the crime of assault against Mr. Hadley, Mr. Goff relies on Section 11-603 of the Criminal Procedure Article, which provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-8\">(a) <em>Conditions for judgment of restitution. </em>\u2014 A court may enter a judgment of restitution that orders a defendant or child respondent to make restitution in addition to any other penalty for the commission of a crime or delinquent act, if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-9\">(1) as a direct result of the crime or delinquent act, property of the victim was stolen, damaged, destroyed, converted, or unlawfully obtained, or its value substantially decreased;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-10\">(2) as a direct result of the crime or delinquent act, the victim suffered:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-11\">(I) actual medical, dental, hospital, counseling, funeral, or burial expenses;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-12\">(ii) any other direct out-of-pocket loss....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>(b) <em>Right of victims to restitution. </em>\u2014 A victim is presumed to have a right to restitution under subsection (a) of this section if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-5\">(1) the victim or the State requests restitution; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-6\">(2) the court is presented with competent evidence of any item listed in subsection (a) of this section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">Md.Code (2001, 2004 Supp.), \u00a7 11-603 of the Criminal Procedure Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">As stated in <em>Oaks v. Connors, </em>339 Md. 24, 35, 660 A.2d 423, 429 (1995), \u201c[t]he first step in determining legislative intent is to look at the statutory language and \u2018[i]f the words of the statute, construed according to their common and everyday meaning, are clear and unambiguous and express a plain meaning, we will give effect to the statute as it is written.\u2019 \u201d <em>Oaks, </em>339 Md. at 35, 660 A.2d at 429 (quoting <em>Jones v. State, </em>336 Md. 255, 261, 647 A.2d 1204, 1206-07 (1994)).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-9\">In <em>Pete v. State, </em>384 Md. 47, 862 A.2d 419 (2004), we determined that the property damage for which the defendant was ordered to pay restitution was not the direct result of the crime of assault for which Pete was convicted. In <em>Pete, </em>the defendant entered the apartment of Susan Raickle and hit her on the back of the head. <em>Pete, </em>384 Md. at 51, 862 A.2d at 421. Ms. Raickle called the police who broadcasted a lookout for Mr. Pete. <em>Id. </em>Almost two hours later, Patrolman First Class Cheesman saw a man matching Mr. Pete\u2019s description in a truck stopped at a traffic light. <em>Id. </em>Patrolman Cheesman turned on his overhead lights and attempted to stop Mr. Pete, who sped away from the police cruiser. <em>Id. </em>During the chase, Mr. Pete stopped abruptly, causing Patrolman Cheesman to strike Mr. Pete\u2019s truck. <em>Pete, </em>384 Md. at 52, 862 A.2d at 421. The police cruiser sustained $6,490.53 in damages. <em>Id. </em>Mr. Pete was convicted of second degree assault and reckless driving, among other things. <em>Pete, </em>384 Md. at 49, 862 A.2d at 420. For the assault on Ms. Raickle, the court sentenced him to eighteen months, with all but two months suspended. <em>Id. </em>The court also placed Pete on probation for three years upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>his release. <em>Id. </em>The conditions of his probation included an order to make restitution to the victim for her injuries, and to the Local Government Insurance Trust (LGIT) for repairs to the police cruiser. <em>Pete, </em>384 Md. at 50, 862 A.2d at 420.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">We held that restitution to the LGIT as a part of the sentence for assault was improper \u201cbecause the damage to Patrolman Cheesman\u2019s cruiser did not arise as a \u2018direct result\u2019 of the second degree assault on Ms. Raikle.\u201d <em>Pete, </em>384 Md. at 57, 862 A.2d at 424.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We reaffirmed, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-5\">\u201cThe chief goal of statutory interpretation is to discover the actual intent of the legislature in enacting the statute, and the legion of cases that support this proposition need not be repeated here. In fact, all statutory interpretation begins, and usually ends, with the statutory text itself for the legislative intent of a statute primarily reveals itself through the statute\u2019s very words. A court may neither add nor delete language so as to reflect an intent not evidenced in the plain and unambiguous language of the statute; nor may it construe the statute with forced or subtle interpretations that limit or extend its application. In short, if the words of a statute clearly and unambiguously delineate the legislative intent, ours is an ephemeral enterprise. We need investigate no further but simply apply the statute as it reads.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-6\"><em>Pete, </em>384 Md. at 57-58, 862 A.2d at 425 (quoting Price <em>v. State, </em>378 Md. 378, 387-88, 835 A.2d 1221, 1226 (2003)). Mr. Pete <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>argued that we should interpret the statute to mean that \u201ca direct result of a crime is limited to the victim of the qualifying crime and that victim\u2019s injuries and/or damages arising from that crime.\u201d <em>Pete, </em>384 Md. at 59, 862 A.2d at 426. Mr. Pete also suggested that we apply a proximate cause analysis to determine the extent of \u201cdirect result\u201d under the statute. <em>Id. </em>The State argued that we should conclude that \u201cany count for which a defendant is convicted under the same charging document would be sufficient to satisfy the statutory \u2018direct result\u2019 test.\u201d <em>Pete, </em>384 Md. at 60, 862 A.2d at 426.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">In deciding this issue, Judge Harrell, writing for the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-6\">The standards governing restitution as a direct penalty for the second degree assault conviction in this case require a particular type of crime, a victim, and damages as a <em>direct result of the crime. </em>We need not engage in a tort causal relationship analysis, nor weigh the persuasion quotient of an attenuated nexus between the damages to Patrolman Cheesman\u2019s police cruiser and the assault on Ms. Raickle. The General Assembly has required a direct result between the qualifying crime committed and the damages inflicted before restitution may be ordered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-7\">sit * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-8\">It is easy to see on this record that the damage to the police cruiser could not be a direct result of the assault on another individual that occurred approximately two hours earlier than the vehicle collision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-9\"><em>Pete, </em>384 Md. at 60-61, 862 A.2d at 426-27.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-10\">By contrast, in the instant case, Mr. Hadley\u2019s assaultive behavior directly caused the damage to the shower, in addition to causing physical injury to Mr. Hadley. That fact is easily established by a review of the record, which included the agreed-upon fact that \u201cOfficer Warehime saw that Hadley had a bloody face and that the shower insert in the bathroom had been broken due to the assault.\u201d Mr. Goff argues that, while physical injury to Mr. Hadley resulting from the assault <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>may be a \u201cdirect result\u201d of the assault, the damage to the shower \u201ccannot legitimately be said to be the \u2018direct result\u2019 of that crime.\u201d Mr. Goff offers no support in his brief or in oral argument for that conclusory assertion, and we are unable to find any support in the record or the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">Section 11-601 of the Criminal Procedure Article, the definition section of the restitution statute, does not include a definition of the term \u201cdirect result.\u201d As noted in <em>Schmerling v. Injured Workers\u2019 Insurance Fund, </em>368 Md. 434, 795 A.2d 715 (2002), when statutory definitions are not explicitly provided, \u201cwe determine the intended scope of the term by applying the language\u2019s natural and ordinary meaning, by considering the express and implied purpose of the statute, and by employing basic principles of common sense, the meaning these words intend to convey.\u201d <em>Schmerling, </em>368 Md. at 444, 795 A.2d at 720. The natural and ordinary meaning of the term \u201cdirect result\u201d most certainly includes the damage done to the shower in the instant case.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> It is clear that Mr. Goff damaged the shower during and because of the assault on Mr. Hadley. No intervening agent or occurrence caused the damage. Additionally, no time lapsed between the criminal act and the resulting damage caused.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> That leads us to conclude, considering the plain language of the statute, that the damage to the shower was a direct result of the crime for which Mr. Goff was convicted.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Therefore, the order to pay restitution was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>\n<em>The Victims of the Crime</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">Section 11-601 of the Criminal Procedure Article defines \u201cvictim\u201d as \u201ca person who suffers personal injury or property damage or loss as a direct result of a crime.... \u201d Md.Code (2001, 2004 Supp.), \u00a7 11\u2014601(j)(l) of the Criminal Procedure Article. Mr. Goff argues that because the victim of the assault (Mr. Hadley) is a tenant and not the owner of the apartment, \u00a7 11-603 does not permit the court to order payment of restitution to Mr. Hadley for the repair of the shower, in connection with the assault conviction. In his brief, Mr. Goff argues that \u201cthe property owner was the party who truly suffered the loss via any property damages, and [Mr. Goff] was not convicted of any crime wherein the landlord/property owner ... was the victim. Thus, the restitution award to Mr. Hadley ... for the property damage/loss suffered by the landlord ... was inappropriate under \u00a7 11-603.\u201d As previously discussed, \u00a7 11-603 permits a court to order a defendant to make restitution if \u201cas a direct result of the crime ... <em>property of the victim </em>was stolen, damaged, destroyed.... \u201d Md.Code (2001, 2004 Supp.), \u00a7 11-603(a)(1) of the Criminal Procedure Article (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">While it is true that Mr. Hadley does not own the apartment in which he lives, it is equally true that as a tenant he has a property interest in the nature of a possessory property right in the apartment.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The fact that the landlord <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number><em>also </em>suffered a loss to his property does not change the fact that the tenant suffered a loss to his possessory property right, for which restitution may properly be granted pursuant to \u00a7 11-603.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We strive to give statutes their \u201cmost reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>able interpretation, in accord with logic and common sense, and to avoid a construction not otherwise evident by the words actually used.\u201d <em>Greco v. State, </em>347 Md. 423, 429, 701 A.2d 419, 422 (1997). To interpret the term \u201cproperty of the victim\u201d so narrowly as to discount the property rights of tenants vis-a-vis restitution in a criminal case such as this one is not \u201cin accord with logic and common sense.\u201d Moreover, our interpretation is supported by the underlying purposes of restitution; namely, rehabilitation, deterrence, and retribution. <em>Grey, </em>363 Md. at 459, 769 A.2d at 899.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Mr. Hadley testified that he was responsible for repairing the shower and that his landlord expected him to repair it. Mr. Goff presented no evidence to refute that assertion. Consequently, the court did not err by deciding that Mr. Hadley was the proper victim for purposes of \u00a7 11-603.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>This case is not like <em>Walczak v. State, </em>302 Md. 422, 488 A.2d 949 (1985), in which we determined that the trial court erred by ordering Walczak to pay restitution to the victim of a robbery of which he was not convicted. <em>Walczak, </em>302 Md. at 430, 488 A.2d at 953. We stated that \u201crestitution is punishment for the crime of which the defendant has been convicted. Restitution depends on the existence of that crime, and the statute authorizes the court to order restitution only where the court is otherwise authorized to impose punishment.\u201d <em>Walczak, </em>302 Md. at 429, 488 A.2d at 952. In the present case, the court ordered Mr. Goff to pay restitution as punishment for the crime of which he was convicted \u2014 assault, which resulted in damage to Mr. Hadley\u2019s person and property.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">Concluding our discussion of this issue, we note that during oral argument, counsel for Mr. Goff raised a number of concerns about what might happen civilly if Mr. Hadley takes the restitution money and fails to repair the shower. We decline to respond to those questions because an answer is not necessary for us to decide the present case. We re-emphasize, however, that restitution is a criminal sanction, not a civil remedy. <em>Grey, </em>363 Md. at 451, 769 A.2d at 895. Furthermore, we remind the parties that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-6\">[t]he order of restitution, even when entered as a civil judgment, concludes only the matters that were raised or that could have been raised, in the criminal proceeding. Although it may be enforced in the manner that a civil judgment may be enforced, it does not, and cannot, establish civil liability for anything beyond the matters it concludes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AObV\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">\n<em>The Reasonableness of the Restitution Order</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Ab1\">Finally, Mr. Goff argues that the restitution award should have been for repair of the shower instead of replacement because, in his view, complete replacement is not reasonable. Mr. Goff argues that replacement is unreasonable be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>cause the $2,156.00 replacement estimate was based on what Mr. Hadley told the estimator about the damage and not based on the estimator\u2019s first-hand view of the damaged shower. Mr. Goff also complains that Mr. Hadley only sought out one estimate for the cost of replacement.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">Mr. Goff relies on \u00a7 11-615 in support of his argument, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-6\">(a) <em>Fair and reasonable charges. </em>\u2014 In a restitution hearing held under \u00a7 11-603 of this subtitle, a written statement or bill for medical, dental, hospital, counseling, funeral, or burial expenses is legally sufficient evidence that a charge shown on the written statement or bill is a fair and reasonable charge for the services or materials provided.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-7\">(b) <em>Burden of proof. </em>\u2014 A person who challenges the fairness and reasonableness of the amount on the statement or bill has the burden of proving that the amount is not fair and reasonable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">Md.Code (2001), \u00a7 11-615 of the Criminal Procedure Article.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The trial court held two hearings on the question of the cost to repair or replace the damaged shower. At the first hearing, Mr. Hadley, a master plumber himself, testified about the damage to the shower and stated that there were \u201cnumerous holes and cracks all through the side of the shower.\u201d In addition, the State introduced a written estimate from Cat\u00f3n Plumbing in the amount of $2,156, signed by Kevin Ohl. At the second hearing, the State called Kevin Ohl who testified in detail about the need to replace the shower and the cost to do so. Mr. Goff testified that he had obtained an estimate for some supplies at Lowe\u2019s and an estimate for the cost of repairing the shower from a contractor, named Mr. Blizzard, in the amount of $523.00. Mr. Goff presented no evidence to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>rebut the testimony of Mr. Ohl regarding the need or cost to replace the shower. By contrast, Mr. Ohl testified that the estimate provided by Mr. Blizzard was far below current market prices. As previously mentioned, after hearing the evidence, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-5\">Here what we have is an item which was probably, prior to the incident, perfectly functional and after the incident, it\u2019s not functional ... it\u2019s not the value of the shower stall here, it\u2019s the value of the materials and services needed to replace it because it\u2019s no longer functional and I think the testimony, the last time, was adequate to establish that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-6\">So, then, the issue is, what is a fair amount of restitution, assuming that the item has to be replaced ... it is the burden of the Defendant to show that the suggested charges by the State are not fair and reasonable and that I think the Defendant has \u2014 has not met his burden.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">In view of the testimony presented at the restitution hearings, the trial court did not err or abuse its discretion in determining that the State\u2019s estimate to replace the shower was fair and reasonable under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b380-9\">In summary, we hold that: (1) the damage to the shower is one of the direct results of the crime of assault; (2) the shower is the property of the victim of the assault, even though he is the tenant and not the owner of the apartment; and (3) ordering replacement of the shower instead of repair was fair and reasonable under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-10\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR CARROLL COUNTY AFFIRMED; APPELLANT TO PAY COSTS.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b361-11\">.

Mr. Hadley is a master plumber who does new construction. He testified that he does not make repairs and that he did not want to attempt to repair the shower himself because \"if something is wrong with the shower, I don't want it to have to come back on me.

You get corner pieces that are fiberglass that basically connect those corners together. When you buy a shower, you buy the separate parts.

You could never get that into a house because the house is already built, so when you go back in to redoing a shower that\u2019s been damaged or needs to be replaced, you have to buy the pieces of the shower and they have to be put together.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b365-7\">.

Though not relevant to the resolution of the instant case, we point out for the sake of completeness that we also held in <em>Pete </em>that restitution to the LGIT was not available under \u00a7 11-603 of the Criminal Procedure Article for the reckless driving charge, even though the damage to the police cruiser was \"undoubtedly a direct result of the reckless driving.\u201d <em>Pete, </em>384 Md. at 56, 862 A.2d 419. That decision was based on the fact that reckless driving is not a \u201ccrime\u201d for which restitution may be ordered, as that term is defined by \u00a7 11\u2014601(d)(2).

Ordinarily, the nature of the landlord-tenant relationship is such that the landlord transfers to the tenant everything that is properly appurtenant to the demised premises or everything essential or reasonably necessary to the full beneficial use and enjoyment of the property. <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Birgfeld, </em>189 Md. 552, 554, 56 A.2d 793, 795 (1948).
