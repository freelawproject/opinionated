Bar Counsel charged Ms. Kreamer with violating several Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct, alleging that she failed to file a Complaint for Absolute Divorce for a client, as she had allegedly promised to do, and that she continually failed to respond to the client\u2019s phone calls and e-mails. Bar Counsel also alleged that Ms. Kreamer failed to provide the client\u2019s new attorney with the client\u2019s file in a timely manner and that she failed to respond to the Attorney Grievance Commission\u2019s letters requesting a written response to the client\u2019s complaint. Finally, Bar Counsel alleged that Ms. Kreamer took funds from the client\u2019s retainer that she had not yet earned.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">The petition alleged that Ms. Kreamer violated Rule 1.1 (Competence),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Rule 1.3 (Diligence),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Rule 1.4 (Communication),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Rule 1.15 (Safekeeping Property),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Rule 1.16 (Declining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>or Terminating Representation),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Rule 8.1 (Bar Admission and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>Disciplinary Matters),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and Rule 8.4 (Misconduct).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Bar Counsel also alleged that Ms. Kreamer violated Rule 16-609 (Prohibited Transactions)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and Md.Code (1989, 2004 Repl.Vol.), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>\u00a7 10-306 of the Business Occupations and Professions Article (Misuse of Trust Money).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> *****9</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">Pursuant to Maryland Rule 16-752, we referred the matter to Judge Susan Souder of the Circuit Court for Baltimore County to make findings of fact and conclusions of law. Following an evidentiary hearing on December 21, 2004, Judge Souder found that Ms. Kreamer violated MRPC Rules 1.3, 1.4, 1.16, 8.1, 1.15, Md. Rule 16-609, and \u00a7 10-306 of the Business and Occupations Article of the Maryland Code. Respondent and petitioner filed exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">I. <em>Hearing Judge\u2019s Opinion</em></p>\n<p id=\"AYt\">Judge Souder made the following factual findings:</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">\u201cOn February 25, 2002, Benchamas D. Sporay (\u2018Client\u2019) met with Respondent to obtain legal advice regarding her separation from her husband, which occurred on January 16, 2002. The Client signed a Retainer/Engagement Agreement (\u2018Agreement\u2019) on March 8, 2002. In the Agreement, the Client agreed to have Respondent represent the Client and perform all necessary legal services in connection with representation in the matter of marital separation and divorce. Furthermore, the Client was to pay Respondent a retainer of two thousand dollars ($2,000.00), which included a two hundred seventy dollar ($270.00) non-refundable engagement fee.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Client agreed to pay Respondent at an hourly rate of one hundred thirty five dollars ($135.00).</p>\n<p id=\"AxP\">\u201cThe Client submitted four checks to Respondent for payment of her representation. On March 8, 2002, the Client paid two thousand dollars ($2,000.00). On March 15, 2002, the Client paid ten dollars ($10.00). Additionally, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>Client paid five hundred dollars ($500.00) on April 17, 2002. Finally, on May 5, 2002, the Client paid two thousand dollars ($2,000.00). Altogether, the client paid $4,510.</p>\n<p id=\"AtKU\">\u201cThe Client\u2019s husband filed a Complaint for Limited Divorce and Other Relief in the Circuit Court for Harford County on March 13, 2002. On April 12, 2002, the Client, through Respondent, filed an Answer and Counter-Complaint for Absolute Divorce.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Respondent represented the Client at a protective order hearing in March 2002, in which the Client sought protection from her husband, and to retrieve her belongings from the marital home. An <em>ex parte </em>Order was granted; and a Consent Order was entered in April. A provision of the Consent Order was that the Client\u2019s husband was not to contact her.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">\u201cIn May 2002, the Client met with Respondent to discuss how the case would proceed. The Client wrote out her reasons for seeking the divorce, and the Respondent wrote her own notes in the margins of the Client\u2019s notes. The Respondent misplaced these notes until the investigation of these charges was underway and never divulged that they were lost to the Client.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">\u201cAfter the May 2002 meeting, other than responding to discovery propounded by the Client\u2019s husband, no action took place in the Client\u2019s divorce matter until January 2003. In January 2003, the Client met with the Respondent and indicated that she wanted to proceed with the divorce action, as it had been twelve months since she had separated from her husband. Respondent told the Client that she would file for an absolute divorce based on a mutual and voluntary separation on her behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">\u201cThe Client e-mailed Respondent on March 28, 2003 and May 14, 2003 seeking an update on the status of her divorce case. Respondent did not respond to either e-mail. On June 23, 2003, the Client telephoned Respondent seeking an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>up-date on her case. Respondent failed to return the Client\u2019s phone call. On July 1, 2003 the Client again [called] Respondent seeking an update of her case, and stated that she was disappointed with Respondent for her procrastination and for ignoring the Client. Respondent called the Client on July 3, 2003 and promised that she would give an update by July 7, 2003. The Respondent failed to respond by July 7, 2003 as promised.</p>\n<p id=\"A37\">\u201cRespondent\u2019s failures regarding communication with the Client continued from July 9, 2003 through August 11, 2003. During that time the Client telephoned Respondent at least eight times. Of those eight telephone contacts the Client left four messages. Respondent failed to respond to any of the messages. Furthermore, on several occasions Respondent indicated to the Client that she was busy with another client and that she would get back to the Client. Respondent failed to do so. Additionally, on one occasion, Respondent answered the call but indicated that she was on her way to court and would have to get back to the Client. Again, Respondent failed to do so. Subsequently, on August 11, 2003 the Client filed a complaint against Respondent with the Attorney Grievance Commission of Maryland (\u2018Petitioner\u2019).</p>\n<p id=\"AY9\">\u201cRespondent testified that from January 17, 2003 through July 29, 2003 she was planning a settlement demand to be submitted to opposing counsel on behalf of the Client.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> There is no physical evidence of Respondent\u2019s progress on the case other than her initial responses to opposing counsel\u2019s discovery requests. Furthermore, Respondent never propounded discovery requests to the opposing party. There was no activity concerning the Client\u2019s file by Respondent in 2003. To the extent Respondent was \u2018planning,\u2019 it was apparently a cerebral exercise undertaken without the benefit of information concerning the opposing party\u2019s current financial information.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>\u201cIndeed, Respondent never determined whether the opposing party was available for the purpose of settlement discussions. At the January 2003 meeting, the Client advised Respondent that her husband, a member of the military reserves, \u2018may be called up.\u2019 Whether Client\u2019s husband\u2019s unit had been activated or would be activated in the future is irrelevant. Respondent made no effort to determine the Client\u2019s husband\u2019s status. She did not inquire of husband\u2019s counsel; she filed no discovery requests in the pending litigation; nor did she ever request an absolute divorce on behalf of the client based on a mutual and voluntary separation. Respondent admits that she was unaware of Client\u2019s husband\u2019s status.</p>\n<p id=\"AEf\">\u201cRespondent\u2019s counsel argues that Respondent believed Client\u2019s husband was in active military service overseas, and unavailable for the case to proceed. If that were true, Respondent\u2019s failure to advise her client that the case could not proceed while her husband was on active duty overseas is inexplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"A6qP\">\u201cOn September 3, 2003 the Client retained Christopher R. Van Roden, Esq. (\u2018Van Roden\u2019) to represent her in her divorce proceedings. Van Roden sent a letter dated September 5, 2003 to the Respondent advising that he had been retained to represent the Client and asking the Respondent to turn over to the Client her case file. Van Roden also asked Respondent for a detailed itemization of all work Respondent performed for the Client since she was retained, and a refund of any unused portion of Client\u2019s retainer. On September 22, 2003 the Respondent filed a Motion to Strike Appearance. However, the Respondent failed to turn over the Client\u2019s file to Van Roden until February 13, 2004, the date of the Respondent\u2019s Attorney Grievance Commission\u2019s Peer Review Meeting. No explanation for the failure to respond promptly to Van Roden was proffered. Respondent\u2019s counsel suggested that Van Roden would have reviewed the Court\u2019s file in any case, and, therefore there was no prejudice to the Client by Respondent\u2019s failure to respond to Van Roden. No preju<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>dice to the Client\u2019s case as a result of Respondent\u2019s delay was shown; Client did have to pay new counsel to review the Court file.</p>\n<p id=\"ADd\">\u201cThe Respondent failed to properly maintain her finances with respect to the Client\u2019s case. On March 15, 2002, the Respondent took $99.50 more than that to which she was entitled from the Client\u2019s retainer when she wrote Check 1329 to herself in the amount of $257.00. Additionally, Respondent took $47.19 from the Client\u2019s retainer when she wrote Check 1364 in the amount of $1,550.00 on June 11, 2002 to herself.</p>\n<p id=\"AbpB\">\u201cRespondent admits that her records showed a $47.19 credit due to Client. All funds due to the Client were eventually paid to the Client, and there is no claim Respondent owes the Client money.</p>\n<p id=\"Ak0\">\u201cRespondent explained her failures as resulting from a campaign for elective office in the Fall of 2002, her decertification by the Client Security Trust Fund for a time, time spent correcting the foregoing problem, and the need to train a new secretary who required constant instruction. These excuses did not constitute valid defenses.</p>\n<p id=\"AkC\">\u201cPetitioner mailed letters to Respondent on three occasions <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> requesting a written response to the complaint filed with Petitioner\u2019s office on August 11, 2003. On all three occasions Respondent failed to submit a response to Petitioner\u2019s request. Furthermore, Respondent did not file an Answer to the Petition for Disciplinary or Remedial Action until October 12, 2004. The untimely Answer was only accepted as Petitioner did not object to the Court vacating its prior Order of Default against Respondent. Eventually, Respondent met with Petitioner\u2019s Investigator concerning the matter on November 17, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-9\">\u201cThe Honorable William O. Carr, Administrative Judge for the Circuit Court of Harford County, testified that he had known Respondent since elementary school. In the six <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>months prior to the hearing, in his opinion, Respondent had evolved into a \u201cgood problem solver.\u201d Prior to that time he observed that she had difficulty in focusing on the issues and could be \u201cproblematic.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">\u201cReverend Clyde Allen Spicer testified to Respondent\u2019s good character.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">Judge Souder made the following conclusions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"AyY\">\u201cPetitioner alleges that Respondent violated the following Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct: 1.1 (Competence), 1.3 (Diligence), 1.4 (Communication), 1.15 (Safekeeping property), 1.16 (Declining or terminating representation), 8.1 (Bar Admission and Disciplinary Matters), and 8.4 (Misconduct). Additionally, Petitioner alleges that Respondent violated Maryland Rule 6-609 (Prohibited transactions) and Md.Code Ann., Business Occupations and Professions, \u00a7 10-306 (Misuse of trust money).</p>\n<p id=\"A1A\">\u201cRespondent was not diligent in her representation of Client in violation of Rule 1.3. Respondent took no action to file an absolute divorce on behalf of Client based on a mutual and voluntary separation when requested to do so in January 2003. At no time in 2002/2003 did Respondent propound discovery that might have assisted her in preparing (as opposed to \u2018planning\u2019) a settlement demand. Nor did Respondent engage in any settlement discussions with opposing counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"AEd\">\u201cRespondent failed to respond meaningfully to numerous communications from Client in violation of Rule 1.4. Respondent failed to provide the file or otherwise communicate with Client\u2019s successor counsel, Mr. Van Roden, for many months in violation of Rule 1.16.</p>\n<p id=\"AJg3\">\u201cBar Counsel states that the failure to communicate and the lack of diligence demonstrate that Respondent is not a competent attorney as required by Rule 1.1. This Court did not find persuasive Bar Counsel\u2019s argument in this case that violations of Rules 1.3 and 1.4 automatically constitute a violation of Rule 1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>\u201cRespondent violated Rule 8.1 by failing to respond to Petitioner\u2019s requests seeking a response to the Client\u2019s complaint. Respondent\u2019s defense that she became paralyzed with fear when she received such requests from Bar Counsel and is unable to act is unacceptable. Respondent\u2019s assertion that illness prevented her from timely responding to the Petition herein was also unpersuasive in light of the fact that she worked on other Client matters and appeared in Court during the illness. Respondent\u2019s apology for her failure to respond in the instant case was accepted.</p>\n<p id=\"A2V\">\u201cWhile Respondent\u2019s sloppy bookkeeping practices resulted in violations of the law \u2014 1.15, 16-609 and 10-306, these were merely technical violations, not in large amounts, that more organized financial record keeping would obviate. Petitioner\u2019s argument that the aforesaid accounting violations also constitute a violation of Rule 8.4 was unpersuasive in this ease.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">II. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">As stated in <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Davis, </em>375 Md. 131, 825 A.2d 430 (2003),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-7\">[t]his Court exercises original jurisdiction over attorney discipline proceedings. We conduct an independent review of the record, accepting the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact unless clearly erroneous. We will not disturb the factual findings of the hearing judge if they are based on clear and convincing evidence. Our review of the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions of law is <em>de novo.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-8\"><em>Davis, </em>375 Md. at 157-58, 825 A.2d at 445-46 (citations omitted). Moreover, Md. Rule 16-757(b) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-9\">The petitioner has the burden of proving the averments of the petition by clear and convincing evidence. A respondent who asserts an affirmative defense or a matter of mitigation or extenuation has the burden of proving the defense or matter by a preponderance of the evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b550-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>III. <em>Exceptions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">Ms. Kreamer filed ten exceptions to Judge Souder\u2019s factual findings and conclusions of law. In particular, Ms. Kreamer excepted to the finding that \u201cthe Counter-Complaint for Absolute Divorce failed to allege a ground upon which an absolute divorce can be granted,\u201d noting that the Answer and Counterclaim that she filed alleged facts that would constitute a ground for divorce under \u00a7 7-103(a)(7) and (8) of the Family Law Article.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The Answer and Counterclaim included the statement that Ms. Sporay,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-5\">avers that she left the home to regain her health and wellbeing after being subjected to verbal and emotional abuse over the course of the marriage, being subjected to extremely violent acts against her by the Plaintiff on numerous occasions, being subjected to intimidation by guns, swords and other weapons being displayed in every room of the house, demoralized by bullet holes remaining in the ceiling for over a year from the Plaintiff/Counter-Defendant\u2019s having discharged his firearms ... he was driving the automobile in which she was a passenger in a dangerous manner so that her head was forced into the dashboard ... there is no reasonable hope or expectation of reconciliation between the parties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">That paragraph was incorporated by reference into the section of the pleading entitled \u201cCounterclaim for Absolute Divorce and Other Relief.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b551-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>We disagree with the hearing judge\u2019s finding that Ms. Kreamer failed to allege a ground upon which an absolute divorce can be granted. The fact that the pleading did not contain the phrase \u201ccruelty of treatment\u201d or \u201cexcessively vicious conduct\u201d does not change the import of the counterclaim. The pleading certainly alleged facts that, if proven, would have supported the grant of an absolute divorce on the grounds of cruelty of treatment.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> As stated in Md. Rule 2-303(b), \u201c[e]ach averment of a pleading shall be simple, concise, and direct. No technical forms of pleadings are required. A pleading shall contain only such statements of fact as may be necessary to show the pleader\u2019s entitlement to relief or ground of defense.... \u201d Ms. Kreamer\u2019s first exception is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">Ms. Kreamer next contends that the hearing judge wrongly found that \u201c[i]n January 2003 ... Respondent told the Client that she would file for an absolute divorce based on a mutual and voluntary separation on her behalf.\u201d Ms. Kreamer argues that she could not have filed for a divorce on those grounds because she knew that there never was a mutual and voluntary separation agreement reached between her client and the client\u2019s husband.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Upon review of the testimony before the court, it is clear (and the Petitioner admits) that Ms. Sporay did not actually state that she had asked Ms. Kreamer to file for an absolute divorce based on a mutual and voluntary separation. Ms. Sporay testified that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>she had a conversation with Ms. Kreamer on January 16 or 17, 2003, and that she \u201ctold her that my separation have come to meet the deadline [sic], 12-month separation. Um, I would like her to go forward with my divorce process.\u201d Ms. Sporay also testified that Ms. Kreamer told her that she would \u201cwork on it,\u201d and that she would file for absolute divorce. No one testified that Ms. Kreamer said that she would file for an absolute divorce <em>based on a mutual and voluntary separation. </em>In fact, as has already been discussed, Ms. Kreamer had already filed for an Absolute Divorce on other grounds in March, 2002, when she filed the Answer to Complaint for Limited Divorce and Other Relief and Counterclaim for Absolute Divorce.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">Ms. Kreamer\u2019s second exception is overruled in part and sustained in part. Insofar as the hearing judge found that Ms. Kreamer promised to file for an absolute divorce, Ms. Kreamer\u2019s second exception is overruled. The hearing judge was free to believe Ms. Sporay\u2019s testimony that Ms. Kreamer promised to file for an absolute divorce after the meeting with the client in January 2003.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> As to the ground for divorce, however, Ms. Kreamer\u2019s exception is sustained. There is no evidence in the record that Ms. Kreamer said she would file <em>on the ground of mutual and voluntary separation. </em>It appears from the hearing judge\u2019s factual findings that the purpose for mentioning the failure to file was to showcase Ms. Kreamer\u2019s continued failure to communicate with Ms. Sporay about the status of her divorce and the failure to do <em>something </em>to move the divorce forward. The particular ground for divorce has nothing to do -with those failures. Thus, in our view, the hearing judge\u2019s error is insignificant.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">Ms. Kreamer\u2019s third exception is to the hearing judge\u2019s finding that \u201cRespondent\u2019s failures regarding communication <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>with the Client continue from July 9, 2003 through August 11, 2003.\u201d Ms. Sporay testified that Ms. Kreamer called her on July 29 and told her that she had been busy with another case and \u201cdidn\u2019t have time for my case that much, but she will try to work on it. Get a copy mailed to my attention by the following week.\u201d Ms. Kreamer testified that the conversation on July 29 was \u201ca substantive conversation that was for the purpose of moving the case forward.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\">In addition, Bar Counsel submitted Ms. Kreamer\u2019s notes from that conversation, as Plaintiffs Exhibit 7. The notes appear to reflect a substantive conversation, making mention of the credit and debt situation of the parties, alimony, and the husband\u2019s retirement account, among other things. Nonetheless, the hearing judge found that \u201cRespondent\u2019s failures regarding communication with the Client continued from July 9, 2003 through August 11, 2003.\u201d Judge Souder also noted that \u201c[djuring that time the Client telephoned Respondent at least eight times. Of those eight telephone contacts the Client left four messages. Respondent failed to respond to any of the messages.\u201d In view of those facts, we cannot say that the hearing judge erred by finding that the communication failures continued during the time mentioned, even if one of the phone calls could be described as substantive. Moreover, Judge Souder was free to believe Ms. Sporay\u2019s testimony about the July 29 call (that it was not substantive) and to disbelieve Ms. Kreamer\u2019s notes and testimony. The chancellor is free to disregard evidence that she considers not credible. <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Vanderlinde, </em>364 Md. 376, 385, 773 A.2d 463, 468 (2001). Respondent\u2019s third exception is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">Ms. Kreamer also excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s finding that \u201c[t]here was no activity concerning the Client\u2019s file by Respondent in 2003\u201d because \u201c[i]t is undisputed that Respondent met with Sporay on January 17, 2003 and also that Respondent and Sporay had a conversation concerning Sporay\u2019s case on July 29, 2003.\u201d Respondent also argues that she \u201chad records ... that were the result of discovery\u201d during <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>that time, that there was \u201can e-mail exchange on May 14, 2003,\u201d and \u201cseveral non-substantive telephone contacts in early July 2003,\u201d and that she \u201cwas planning the elements of a settlement demand which included the items that were narrated on the notes of July 29.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">First, it was not error for Judge Souder to refuse to consider the e-mails and several phone contacts as \u201cactivity\u201d on the client\u2019s case.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Those non-substantive contacts did nothing to propel Ms. Sporay\u2019s divorce forward. Second, the fact that-Ms. Kreamer \u201chad records ... that were the result of discovery\u201d during the time in question does nothing to prove that she did anything with that discovery during that time or that she attempted to obtain any new discovery during that time. In fact, Ms. Kreamer testified that she did not file or propound interrogatories or request for production of documents between January and July of 2003. She also testified that the most recent financial information that she had was from March of 2002. Third, Judge Souder was free to disbelieve (and apparently did disbelieve) Ms. Kreamer\u2019s testimony that she was planning a settlement demand from January through July of 2003. She specifically found that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-5\">[t]here is no physical evidence of Respondent\u2019s progress on the case other than her initial responses to opposing counsel\u2019s discovery requests. Furthermore, Respondent never propounded discovery requests to the opposing party. There was no activity concerning the Client\u2019s file by Respondent in 2003. To the extent Respondent was \u201cplanning,\u201d it was apparently a cerebral exercise undertaken <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>without the benefit of information concerning the opposing party\u2019s current financial information.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b555-4\">Ms. Kreamer admitted that she did not present a settlement demand after January 17, 2003. Fourth, and finally, even though everyone agrees that Ms. Kreamer and Ms. Sporay had a meeting in January of 2003, we cannot say it was clearly eiToneous for the hearing judge to find that no activity had taken place on Ms. Sporay\u2019s file in 2003, especially in view of Ms. Sporay\u2019s testimony that the meeting in January consisted solely of Ms. Sporay telling Ms. Kreamer that she wanted her case to be moved forward and Ms. Kreamer saying that she would work on the case. <em>Saying </em>that she would work on the case is different than actually working on the case. While the meeting may qualify technically as \u201cactivity\u201d in the case, it is clear from Judge Souder\u2019s discussion that the kind of activity needed to move the case forward was completely lacking between January 2003 and the end of Ms. Kreamer\u2019s representation of Ms. Sporay. We think that is the kind of inactivity that was considered. Ms. Kreamer\u2019s fourth exception is overruled.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-5\">Ms. Kreamer next excepts to the finding that,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-6\">[a]t the January 2003 meeting, the Client advised Respondent that her husband, a member of the military reserves, \u201cmay be called up,\u201d Whether Client\u2019s husband\u2019s unit had been activated or would be activated in the future is irrelevant.

Ms. Kreamer also relies on Plaintiffs Exhibit 3 (her notes of the January 17, 2003 meeting), in which she wrote, \u201che may be called up.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b556-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>The fact that Ms. Kreamer knew that Ms. Sporay\u2019s husband was on active duty in 2001 and that he <em>may </em>be called up in 2003 does not mean that Ms. Kreamer was aware of Ms. Sporay\u2019s husband\u2019s <em>cuvrent </em>status, the only status that was relevant to the question of how to proceed with the divorce. In fact, Ms. Kreamer testified that she thought the husband may have been on active duty in January 2003, but that she did not know \u201cfor sure\u201d if he was. She also admitted that she did not tell Ms. Sporay at the January meeting that they could not proceed with the divorce if her husband had been on active duty at the time.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In view of that testimony, we cannot say the finding on the matter was clearly erroneous.

Pointing out that the new attorney \u201cnecessarily, in the exercise of prudence, would review the court file when taking over representation,\u201d does nothing to change the fact that Ms. Sporay would never have incurred the additional expense if Ms. Kreamer had properly represented her and moved her divorce forward. Ms. Kreamer\u2019s sixth exception is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">Ms. Kreamer next excepts to the finding that \u201c[t]he Honorable William O. Carr, Administrative Judge for the Circuit Court of Harford County, testified that he had known Ms. Kreamer since elementary school. In the six months prior to the hearing, in his opinion, Respondent had evolved into a \u2018good problem solver.\u2019\u201d Ms. Kreamer argues that Judge Carr actually testified that he had \u201cbeen quite impressed over [the past six months] by her ability to [be a problem solver] for her clients.\u201d While it is true that Judge Carr made this statement, he also stated that he had \u201cseen Barbara evolve into what I think is a pretty good problem solver.\u201d Judge Souder was not required to repeat everything in Judge Carr\u2019s testimony, and the finding she made is supported by the testimony in the record. <em>See Attorney Griev.

Absent indications that such evidence is not considered, we presume it was considered along with all the other evidence\u201d). Ms. Kreamer\u2019s seventh exception is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">Ms. Kreamer excepts to the conclusion that she was \u201cnot diligent in her representation of client in violation of Rule 1.3.\u201d As previously noted, Rule 1.3 requires a lawyer to \u201cact with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client.\u201d While we disagree with the conclusion that Ms. Kreamer should have filed an absolute divorce \u201cbased on a mutual and voluntary separation when requested to do so,\u201d we agree with the rest of Judge Souder\u2019s assessment regarding the failure to do anything to move the case forward. From January 2003, when Ms. Sporay made her wishes known about moving forward with the divorce, through the end of her representation of Ms. Sporay, Ms. Kreamer propounded no discovery, made no settlement demands on opposing counsel, and repeatedly ignored Ms. Sporay\u2019s calls and e-mails. <em>See Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Awuah, </em>374 Md. 505, 522, 823 A.2d 651, 661 (2003) (holding that respondent violated Rule 1.3 because he did little work on a client\u2019s case and was not responsive to her requests about her case, among other things); <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Cohen, </em>361 Md. 161, 174, 760 A.2d 706, 713 (2000) (holding that respondent violated Rule 1.3 because of repeated failure to return phone calls from client, among other things). Even if the January 2003 meeting and the July 2003 phone call were substantive (because Ms. Kreamer was gathering pertinent information from her own client), the record does not reflect that Ms. Kreamer did anything with that information during the relevant time period to obtain a divorce for her client.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">Ms. Kreamer\u2019s argument that \u201c[fjiling a supplemental complaint for absolute divorce in January 2003 would have been a waste of Respondent\u2019s time and Sporay\u2019s money if Mr. Sporay was on active duty ...,\u201d is unavailing. It does not save Ms. Kreamer to argue, after the fact, that Mr. Sporay actually was on active duty at the time, which would have prevented even the most diligent attorney from obtaining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>additional discovery or a divorce.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The hearing judge found that Ms. Kreamer was unaware of Mr. Sporay\u2019s active duty status during the relevant time period. Further, the hearing judge did not believe that Ms. Kreamer informed Ms. Sporay that they could not move forward while Mr. Sporay was on active duty. As a result, we cannot say Judge Souder erred by finding that Ms. Kreamer did not act \u201cwith reasonable diligence and promptness.\u201d Ms. Kreamer\u2019s eighth exception is overruled. Ms. Kreamer violated Rule 1.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">Ms. Kreamer next excepts to the conclusion that \u201cRespondent failed to respond meaningfully to numerous communications from Client in violation of Rule 1.4.\u201d In support of this exception, Ms. Kreamer points to her representation of Ms. Sporay when she was first retained and notes the hearings and orders that she obtained \u201cexpeditiously ... in order to protect her client.\u201d Anything Ms. Kreamer did to represent Ms. Sporay before January 2003 is irrelevant to whether Ms. Kreamer failed to communicate with her client after January 2003, the relevant time period in this case.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Even if Ms. Kreamer represented Ms. Sporay well at the beginning of her representation, it does not change the fact that during the relevant time period in this case she failed to respond to requests for information from Ms. Sporay.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">Ms. Kreamer also argues that since she was informed in January 2003 that Ms. Sporay\u2019s husband \u201cmay be called up,\u201d her \u201cbrief\u2019 telephone calls and e-mails to the client were acceptable. We disagree. As mentioned earlier, Rule 1.4 requires attorneys to keep their clients \u201creasonably informed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>about the status of a matter\u201d and to \u201cpromptly comply with reasonable requests for information.\u201d In addition, the rule requires attorneys to \u201cexplain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation.\u201d Judge Souder\u2019s findings include a litany of failures to respond meaningfully to Ms. Sporay\u2019s requests for information, over a span of many months. The hearing judge also found that even if Ms. Kreamer had known that Mr. Sporay was on active duty, \u201cRespondent\u2019s failure to advise her client that the case could not proceed ... is inexplicable.\u201d In view of those facts, we agree with the hearing judge that Ms. Kreamer violated Rule 1.4. <em>See Attorney Griev. Commn\u2019n v. Zuckerman, </em>386 Md. 341, 369, 872 A.2d 693, 710 (2005) (holding that respondent\u2019s \u201cfailure to pay medical bills in a timely manner and to disburse client funds\u201d violated Rule 1.4 because respondent failed \u201cto keep his clients reasonably informed about the status of their cases.\u201d); <em>Attorney Griev.

In addition, she cooperated with the investigation by meeting with the investigator, producing documents, and submitting to a deposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>Rule 8.1 notes that a lawyer, in connection with a disciplinary matter, shall not \u201cknowingly fail to respond to a lawful demand for information from ...

It also cited Rule 16-731(d)<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> and noted the concern about completing the investigation within the time established. Finally, the letter informed Ms. Kreamer of Rule 8.1. The September 8 letter referenced the first letter, gave Ms. Kreamer seven days to reply, and reminded Ms. Kreamer of Rule 8.1. Finally, the October 15 letter granted Ms. Kreamer\u2019s oral request for an extension and noted that her response was expected by October 29. Ms. Kreamer\u2019s eventual response to the Commission, while certainly much better than no response at all, does not excuse her repeated failures to respond in writing, as requested by the Commission several times. <em>See Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Fezell, </em>361 Md. 234, 249, 253, 760 A.2d 1108 (2000) (noting this Court\u2019s \u201clong history of holding that an attorney violates Rule 8.1(b) by failing to respond to letters from disciplinary authorities requesting information,\u201d and also holding that respondent\u2019s \u201cbelated cooperation with Bar Counsel does not excuse respondent\u2019s failure to respond to the previous five letters sent by Bar Counsel\u201d). We agree with the hearing judge that Ms. Kreamer violated Rule 8.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">Bar Counsel excepted to the failure of Judge Souder to find a violation of Maryland Rule of Professional Conduct 1.1 (Competence). Rule 1.1 requires a lawyer to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>\u201cprovide competent representation to a client. Competent representation requires the legal knowledge, skill, thoroughness and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation.\u201d In support of this argument, Bar Counsel points to Judge Souder\u2019s findings regarding Ms. Kreamer\u2019s failure to propound discovery, make a settlement demand, or find out about Ms. Sporay\u2019s husband\u2019s military status. Judge Souder did not find that Ms. Kreamer violated Rule 1.1 and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AAk\">Bar Counsel states that the failure to communicate and the lack of diligence demonstrate that Respondent is not a competent attorney as required by Rule 1.1. This Court did not find persuasive Bar Counsel\u2019s argument in this case that violations of Rules 1.3 and 1.4 automatically constitute a violation of Rule 1.1.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">We agree that a violation of Rule 1.3 (Diligence) and 1.4 (Communication) does not automatically, in every case, constitute a violation of Rule 1.1 (Competence). Sometimes, however, the facts that support a finding that a respondent violated Rule 1.3 or Rule 1.4 will also support a finding that a respondent violated Rule 1.1. <em>See </em>Zuckerman, 386 Md. at 368-370, 872 A.2d at 709-10 (holding that respondent violated Rule 1.1 because he failed to pay clients after settlement for years and because he failed to tell clients that he was holding settlement funds and not paying their medical bills, and holding that the same set of behaviors also constituted a violation of Rule 1.3 and Rule 1.4).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">Rule 1.1 requires competent counsel to possess the \u201clegal knowledge, skill, thoroughness and preparation <em>reasonably necessary </em>for the representation.\u201d (Emphasis added.) As mentioned previously, the fact that Mr. Sporay actually was on active duty during Ms. Kreamer\u2019s representation of Ms. Sporay did not insulate Ms. Kreamer from a finding that she did not act with reasonable diligence, in violation of Rule 1.3. A diligent attorney would have done <em>some </em>work on the case between January and August of 2003, even if that work would have been brought to a halt once the attorney discovered the active duty status of the husband. That same fact, however, does insulate Ms. Kreamer from a finding of incompetence in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>this case. In reality, it was not \u201creasonably necessary\u201d for Ms. Kreamer to propound discovery or make a settlement demand at the time in question because Mr. Sporay\u2019s active duty status would have prevented her from doing so effectively. Therefore, we overrule petitioner\u2019s first exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\">Bar Counsel also excepted to Judge Souder\u2019s statement that \u201cRespondent\u2019s apology for her failure to respond in the instant case was accepted,\u201d stating that \u201c[t]here was no evidence introduced at trial that the Respondent apologized for failing to respond.\u201d Ms. Kreamer\u2019s reply to this exception is that petitioner \u201cwill not deny that, Respondent had apologized to Petitioner in the several contacts between [them] prior to the trial.\u201d Respondent has not pointed to any place in the record containing evidence of an apology. We note, however, that when asked why she did not provide a written answer to the complaint against her, Ms. Kreamer\u2019s response was \u201cWell, I certainly regret it but ... I responded to the emergency of the McKinsey family....\u201d That statement is enough to support the hearing judge\u2019s finding on this matter. Moreover, even if Ms. Kreamer apologized for her failure to respond to Bar Counsel\u2019s requests, that apology does not excuse her failure to respond. It does not change our previous decision to uphold Judge Souder\u2019s finding that Ms. Kreamer violated Rule 8.1(b). We overrule petitioner\u2019s second exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">Based upon our review of the record, we are satisfied that the evidence supports the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact, except where noted otherwise, in accordance with the clear and convincing evidence standard. In addition, we agree with the hearing judge that Ms. Kreamer violated Rules 1.3, 1.4, 1.15, 1.16, 8.1, Md. Rule 16-609, and \u00a7 10-306 of the Business and Occupations Article of the Maryland Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">IV. <em>Sanction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">Turning to the question of the appropriate sanction, we note that our goal in attorney discipline matters is \u201cto protect the public and the public\u2019s confidence in the legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>profession rather than to punish the attorney.\u201d <em>Attorney Griev.

Bar Counsel, however, recommends a two-year suspension, noting that Ms. Kreamer has previously been disciplined by the Court on two separate occasions. On February 2, 1999, this Court indefinitely suspended her from the practice of law upon finding that Ms. Kreamer failed to communicate with her clients and Bar Counsel, failed to deposit unearned fees in escrow, and mis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>represented the status of client matters. 353 Md. 85, 724 A.2d 666 (1999). We reinstated Ms. Kreamer on June 10, 1999, requiring that she be monitored for two years. On November 19, 2002, this Court reprimanded Ms. Kreamer (with her consent) for not acting with diligence regarding a guardianship matter. Bar Counsel noted at oral argument, however, that Ms. Kreamer had a practice monitor at the time and that contributed to the lesser sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">In support of his recommendation for a two-year suspension, Bar Counsel states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-6\">The Respondent\u2019s conduct in this case is a repeat of prior misconduct. It appears that the Respondent\u2019s prior sanctions by this Court and the two (2) year monitor has not caused the Respondent to improve her practice. A substantial suspension in this matter is necessary to protect the public from future harm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">Bar Counsel cites <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Montgomery, </em>318 Md. 154, 567 A.2d 112 (1989) in support of the request for a two-year suspension. That case is distinguishable from the present case. In <em>Montgomery, </em>respondent was found to have failed to do things he had promised to do on the cases of <em>multiple </em>clients and to have failed to respond to their repeated requests for information about their various cases. <em>Montgomery, </em>318 Md. at 156-59, 567 A.2d at 113-14. In fact, he disappeared from his office and made it impossible for his clients to reach him. His own staff informed clients that his whereabouts were unknown. <em>Montgomery, </em>318 Md. at 157, 567 A.2d at 113. Moreover, he fabricated documents that he claimed to have filed on behalf of clients, presumably in an attempt to make it look like he had worked on the case. <em>Montgomery, </em>318 Md. at 157, 567 A.2d at 114., Respondent in that case had been disciplined previously for \u201cfive instances of professional misconduct, primarily neglect and failure to communicate with his clients between 1977 and 1981,\u201d for which he received a sixty-day suspension. <em>Montgomery, </em>318 Md. at 163, 567 A.2d at 117. Noting that respondent\u2019s acts in the earlier case were very similar to the acts in the current case, we held that respondent \u201ccontinued to neglect his clients\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>affairs and to be inaccessible to them after the client-attorney relationship has been established.\u201d <em>Montgomery, </em>318 Md. at 164, 567 A.2d at 117. We disbarred Mr. Montgomery. <em>Montgomery, </em>318 Md. at 165, 567 A.2d at 118. The facts in the case at bar are not as egregious as those in <em>Montgomery. </em>Ms. Kreamer has not been accused of ignoring multiple clients, over periods of years.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">Bar Counsel also cites <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Howard, </em>299 Md. 731, 475 A.2d 466 (1984). <em>Howard </em>is inapposite. In <em>Howard, </em>we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-5\">Here there was evidence to show that Howard had practiced law in Maryland for approximately 28 years, and that the disciplinary rules violations in this case arose from a difficult relationship with a single client. Nevertheless, Howard misappropriated a client\u2019s funds and, among other things, neglected a legal matter, commingled funds, failed to keep records, and engaged in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice. No extenuating circumstances were presented.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-6\"><em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Howard, </em>299 Md. at 737, 475 A.2d at 469. We also noted Mr. Howard\u2019s previous infractions, which included neglecting cases and failing to be present for hearings on a number of occasions, for which he was reprimanded. <em>Id. </em>We disbarred Mr. Howard. The other cases relied on by Bar Counsel are equally unavailing. <em>See Attorney Grievance Commission v. Pollack, </em>279 Md. 225, 369 A.2d 61 (1977) (holding that respondent had acted carelessly and negligently in three matters entrusted to him \u2014 -including a divorce that was delayed for two years \u2014 and suspending him for six months); and <em>Maryland State Bar Ass\u2019n v.

We also think, however, that doing nothing or simply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>imposing a reprimand as requested by Ms. Kreamer is too lenient. As we stated in <em>Phoebus:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-4\">It is apparent that the prior sanctions \u2014 by way of suspensions \u2014 did not succeed in imparting to him an appreciation of the seriousness of the duties an attorney owes his clients.

He also violated Rule 1.4 because he repeatedly failed to respond to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>client inquiries and because he failed to tell his clients of his suspension from the practice of law. <em>Cassidy, </em>362 Md. at 698, 766 A.2d at 637. Bar Counsel recommended an indefinite suspension in view of respondent\u2019s disciplinary history. <em>Cassidy, </em>362 Md. at 699, 766 A.2d at 637. Mr. Cassidy suggested a reprimand. <em>Cassidy, </em>362 Md. at 700, 766 A.2d at 638. Mr. Cassidy\u2019s prior violations included a number of reprimands for violations of Rule 1.3 and an eighteen-month suspension for failing to obtain proper payoff amounts in four real estate settlements and for not releasing liens. <em>Cassidy, </em>362 Md. at 699, 766 A.2d at 637.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">We noted that \u201c \u2018lack of communication with one\u2019s client, for whatever reason, is a matter of continuing concern to the public,\u2019 warranting disciplinary sanction.\u201d <em>Cassidy, </em>362 Md. at 700, 766 A.2d at 637 (quoting <em>Attorney Griev.

We also stated that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-5\">when we consider Respondent\u2019s conduct in light of his prior disciplinary history, it is clear that, to protect the public, an increase in the degree of discipline beyond that of a reprimand is necessary. The conduct underlying the instant infractions is the same conduct for which Respondent had been disciplined in the past.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b568-6\"><em>Cassidy, </em>362 Md. at 700, 766 A.2d at 638. We imposed a sanction of an indefinite suspension and conditioned Mr. Cassidy\u2019s reinstatement on a number of conditions. <em>Cassidy, </em>362 Md. at 701, 766 A.2d at 638.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">As in <em>Cassidy, </em>the conduct underlying the infractions in Ms. Kreamer\u2019s case is the same conduct for which Ms. Kreamer was previously disciplined (failure to communicate with clients and Bar Counsel and lack of diligence). In view of those facts, discipline beyond a reprimand is necessary. Having considered the particular facts and circumstances of this case and Ms. Kreamer\u2019s prior discipline history, we think the appropriate sanction is an indefinite suspension with the right to reapply for reinstatement after the expiration of six months. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>The period of suspension shall commence thirty (30) days from the date of entry of this Opinion and Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">\n<em>IT IS SO ORDERED; RESPONDENT SHALL PAY ALL COSTS AS TAXED BY THE CLERK OF THIS COURT, INCLUDING THE COSTS OF ALL TRANSCRIPTS, PURSUANT TO MARYLAND RULE 16-515(c), FOR WHICH SUM JUDGMENT IS ENTERED IN FAVOR OF THE ATTORNEY GRIEVANCE COMMISSION OF MARYLAND AGAINST BARBARA OSBORN KREAMER.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b540-8\">.

We recognize that Ms. Kreamer had already filed for absolute divorce on the grounds of cruelty of treatment and excessively vicious conduct when she filed the answer and counterclaim for divorce in April of 2002.

The colloquy on this matter is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-5\">Q. ... Was there any way that you could have, um, told her that you were proceeding with the case after January 17th, '03 knowing that ... the defendant in the counter-complaint was on active duty with the military?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-6\">A. No, I couldn't have told her that. And really the substance, what I would say to Mrs. Sporay, I would describe as palliative, to try to help her know that I was in her corner, you know, concerned about how this was going to come out. I knew that I could not move this case forward for her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-7\">Q. Why didn\u2019t you tell her, look, we can't do anything in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-8\">A. Well\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-9\">Q. You know he is on active duty, why didn't you tell her that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-10\">A. I should have said something more definite about, we're at a standstill here. But she was very, very upset....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-11\">Just before that testimony, however, Ms. Kreamer testified that she was sure she would have had a discussion with Ms. Sporay about the effect of the husband being on active duty because that \"is a big issue practicing law in Aberdeen\u201d and that she would have informed the client that \"she could not divorce him while he is on active duty.\u201d Apparently, the hearing judge believed Ms. Kreamer\u2019s statement that she did not tell her client about the problems with proceeding with the divorce if her husband was on active duty.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b556-12\">. In support of this exception, Ms. Kreamer also notes that Ms. Sporay's new attorney, Mr. Van Roden, filed a complaint for absolute divorce on December 20, 2003, and that Mr. Sporay's attorney then filed a Motion to Stay Proceedings because Mr. Sporay was on active duty in Iraq at the time. Mr. Van Roden did not know when Mr. Sporay had gone on active duty. The fact that Mr. Sporay was on active duty at the time the new lawyer attempted to move the case forward does nothing to discredit the finding that Ms. Kreamer did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>know what Mr. Sporay\u2019s status was and that she did nothing to determine it during her representation of Ms. Sporay. The hearing judge was free to disbelieve Ms. Kreamer\u2019s testimony that she knew that Mr. Sporay was on active duty and out of the country. She was also free to disbelieve Ms. Kreamer's testimony that she was sure she had informed Ms. Sporay that she could not have divorced her husband while he was on active duty.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b557-7\">. The hearing judge made this finding after a discussion of Ms. Kreamer\u2019s failure to respond to Mr. Van Roden\u2019s requests for Ms. Sporay's file. Judge Souder noted that \u2018\u2018[n]o prejudice to the Client\u2019s case as a result of Ms. Kreamer\u2019s delay was shown; Client did have to pay new counsel to review the Court file.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b559-7\">. Ms. Kreamer argues that it took Mr. Van Roden many months to obtain discovery and a final divorce, once he took over the representation of Ms. Sporay. On this point, we agree with Petitioner. Whatever Mr. Van Roden did to represent Ms. Sporay is irrelevant to the case at bar. The facts of this case remain painfully clear: Ms. Kreamer did virtually nothing to represent her client or even to communicate with her client from January 2003 until the client terminated the representation eight months later. That is the material point.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b559-8\">.
