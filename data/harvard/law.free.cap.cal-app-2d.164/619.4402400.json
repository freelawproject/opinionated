He pleaded not guilty to the offense charged, but admitted the prior conviction. Following a trial, at which he was represented by the public defender, the jury returned a verdict of guilty. Judgment was pronounced and defendant has appealed from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">Upon appellant\u2019s request that an attorney be appointed to represent him upon the appeal, the court appointed Mr. Douglas C. Busath of the Sacramento Bar. Mr. Busath has informed the court that after a thorough review of the record it is his opinion that appellant had a fair trial and there are no meritorious grounds of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">However, we have made a careful study of the entire record and agree that the appeal is without any merit whatever. The evidence is overwhelming that appellant took an automobile belonging to Doyle Crane in the city of Ukiah and, without the owner\u2019s permission, drove it to Clear Lake in Lake County where he was apprehended while in possession of the automobile. The record shows that appellant was ably defended; that he received a fair trial and that the evidence fully supports the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-9\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-10\">Van Dyke, P. J., and Warne, J. pro tem.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b636-11\">Assigned by Chairman of Judicial Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
