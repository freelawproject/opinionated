J.</author>\n<p id=\"AgcT\">Plaintiff has a final judgment against defendant for over $3,800. Plaintiff levied execution on defendant\u2019s wages. Defendant claimed that such wages were entirely exempt because all of his earnings were necessary for the support of his family, supporting such claim by the required affidavit. Plaintiff filed an affidavit in opposition. A hearing was had. No transcript of that hearing has been filed. The trial court entered a minute order to the effect \u201cthat Thirty-eight Dollars ($38.00) of the monthly wages is subject to execution.\u201d Defendant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-7\">Plaintiff has failed to file a brief in support of the order. In such event, under rule 17(b) of the Rules on Appeal \u201cthe court may accept as true the statement of facts in the appellant\u2019s opening brief.\u201d The court may assume that the point urged on appeal is meritorious. <em>(Postin </em>v. <em>Griggs, </em>66 Cal.App.2d 147 [151 P.2d 887]; <em>Bendlage </em>v. <em>Kohlsaat, </em>54 Cal.App.2d 136 [128 P.2d 691].) But this does not mean that the case will automatically be reversed. The burden to show error is on appellant. Therefore, the court must examine appellant\u2019s brief to see if the points raised are meritorious, and, if found not to be meritorious, should affirm. (See generally 4 Cal.Jur.2d \u00a7 496, p. 334.)</p>\n<p id=\"b756-8\">In his affidavit claiming the exemption defendant lists his income as $348 per month and his \u201cnecessary monthly expenses\u201d as $375.50. Included in the list are \u201cInstallment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>Contracts\u2014$71.00\u201d and \u201cIncidentals\u2014$25.00.\u201d Appellant states in his brief that he and his wife testified at the hearing as the only witnesses; that appellant testified that he is regularly employed by Crown Paint Company and receives from them $348 monthly as wages; that his wife works intermittently as a domestic, averaging about $16 a week from this source.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-4\">Appellant claims that on such a record, as a matter of law, he is entitled to an exemption of all of his wages under section 690.11 of the Code of Civil Procedure. That section provides that one-half of the earnings of a wage earner for a fixed period are exempt from execution without filing a claim and that \u201cAll of such earnings, if necessary for the use of the debtor\u2019s family, residing in this State, and supported in whole or in part by such debtor\u201d are exempt, upon filing a claim therefor unless the debts are incurred \u201cfor the common necessaries of life\u201d or for personal services of an employee of the debtor. Of course, whether such earnings are \u201cnecessary for the use of the debtor\u2019s family\u201d presents a question of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">The basic theory of such exemption is that a debtor and his family, regardless of the debtor\u2019s improvidence, will retain enough money to maintain a basic standard of living in order that the debtor may have a fair chance to remain a productive member of the community. <em>(Bailey </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>215 Cal. 548 [11 P.2d 865]; <em>Avilla </em>v. <em>Avilla, </em>81 Cal. App.2d 210 [183 P.2d 668].)  The statute should be liberally construed in order to effectuate this purpose. <em>(Holmes </em>v. <em>Marshall, </em>145 Cal. 777 [79 P. 534, 104 Am.St.Rep. 86, 2 Ann.Cas. 88, 69 L.R.A. 67]; <em>Van Lue </em>v. <em>Wahrlich-Cornett Co., </em>12 Cal.App. 749 [108 P. 717].)  But the burden of proof is upon the judgment debtor to establish his right to such an exemption. <em>(Carter </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>55 Cal.App.2d 13 [130 P.2d 186]; <em>Bertozzi </em>v. <em>Swisher, </em>27 Cal.App.2d 739 [81 P.2d 1016]; <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>77 Cal. 194 [19 P. 377].)  In determining whether the debtor has met this burden of proof the trial court is necessarily vested with wide discretion. This is so because the determination of what is \u201cnecessary for the use of the debtor\u2019s family\u201d is not subject to precise definition, and differs with each debtor. Thus, the determination must be largely left to the discretion of the trial court. <em>(Sanker </em>v. <em>Humborg, </em>48 Cal.App.2d 205 [119 P.2d 433]; see also <em>Los Angeles Finance Co. </em>v. <em>Flores, 110 </em>Cal.App.2d Supp. 850 [243 P.2d 139].)</p>\n<p id=\"b758-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>The trial court has impliedly found that the debtor has not met the required burden, and that $38 a month of his income is subject to execution, i.e., not \u201cnecessary\u201d for him or for his family. In attacking this finding we are not supplied with a reporter\u2019s transcript. We are furnished with the two affidavits, and appellant\u2019s opening brief, which purports to summarize the evidence produced at the hearing. According to the affidavit and summary, appellant\u2019s obligations exceed his income by $27.50. But one such obligation is listed as \u201cIncidentals\u201d for which $25 is allocated. This does not prove, as a matter of law, that such \u201cincidentals\u201d were reasonably necessary for the debtor or his family. Another ambiguous and unexplained item is \u201cInstallment Contracts\u2014$71.00.\u201d What the installments were for and whether the articles involved were necessary for the family does not appear. Appellant also concedes that his wife earns over $64 per month as a domestic. If this figure be included, the family balance sheet shows an excess of income over expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">Under these circumstances it cannot be held that, as a matter of law, the trial court abused its discretion in finding that $38 a month of the debtor\u2019s income was subject to execution. The appellant has failed to meet the burden of establishing that all of his wages, including the $38, were \u201cnecessary\u201d for the use of his family.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">The order appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">Bray, J., and St. Clair, J. pro tem.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b758-7\">Assigned by Chairman of Judicial Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
