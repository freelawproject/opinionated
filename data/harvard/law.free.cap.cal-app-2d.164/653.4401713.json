Her will, admitted to probate, devised and bequeathed the residue of her estate to the Monterey County Trust and Savings Bank to be held in trust, for the following purposes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-12\"><em>\u201c(A) To permit my husband, JAMES LESLIE DOULTON, to occupy rent free my home </em>. . . <em>together with the furnishings and household appurtenances therein belonging and located.

The husband died on February 24,1956, leaving the \u201chome\u201d and some $45,000 in cash to people other than the plaintiffs-remainder-men.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>In a portion of the complaint the plaintiffs refer to and list as Exhibits \u201cH\u201d through \u201cS\u201d the eleven Annual Accounts of the Trustee, under the wife\u2019s will, from 1932 to 1944, and allege that the accounts were annually settled by the court. The Exhibits \u201cH\u201d through \u201c S \u201d were not actually attached to the complaint but, by stipulation at the oral argument, we have been furnished copies thereof. The plaintiffs did not plead, and we were not furnished with copies of the orders of the court settling the accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">The plaintiffs do allege the settling of the Final Account of the Trustee based on Exhibit \u201c S \u201d and the transfer thereof of all of the assets of the trust to the husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">In Exhibit \u201cQ,\u201d the Ninth Annual Account and Report of Trustee and Petition for Instructions, the trustee set forth the provisions of the will, and in particular Paragraph Sixth as to invasion of the corpus to pay the $5,000 annually to the husband. It alleged deficiencies in the said payments of $3,200 in the year ending August 9, 1937; $5,000 in 1938; $5,000 in 1939; $5,000 in 1940 to $5,000 in 1941 or total of $23,200 then owed the husband under the will. It further alleged that the husband offered to buy the property for $34,-000, subject to a then existing mortgage of $11,550, taken out by the trustee in a previous year; and had retained counsel and was demanding payment of the amounts due. The trustee sought instruction as to whether or not he should accept the offer of the husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">In Exhibit \u201cR,\u201d the Tenth Annual Account and Report of Trustee, it is alleged that, in response to the request as above, in the Ninth Account, the court had instructed the trustee to accept the offer of the husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-8\">Exhibit \u201cS,\u201d the Eleventh Annual Account and Report of Trustee, and Petition for Instructions, contains allegation of deficiencies of payments to husband of $450 in 1941 (this showed up in Exhibits \u201cQ\u201d and \u201cR\u201d); $5,000 in 1942; $5,000 in 1943; $5,000 in 1944 or a total of $15,450. It alleged the value of the total assets in the trust to be $10,964.50. The trustee requested instructions as to whether or not it should do the thing that plaintiffs allege it did, to wit, transfer all the assets of the estate to the husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-9\">It would appear that the only reasonable inference this court can make is that the court instructed the trustee to make the transfer in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-10\">\n<em>Are the plaintiffs hound hy the orders settling the trustee\u2019s accounts?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b674-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>The plaintiffs were named and their addresses given (and an affidavit attached that the addresses were correct) in all of the annual accounts of the trustee. Section 1120 of the Probate Code provides a method for settling such accounts and imposed, by law, a duty on the trustee to mail a copy of the account to each beneficiary. That such duty has been performed is a disputable presumption. (Code Civ. Proe., \u00a7 1963.)</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">It follows that plaintiffs had notice of the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">A proceeding under section 1120 of the Probate Code (and all annual accounts specifically alleged they were filed pursuant to said code section) is a proceeding <em>in rem. </em>The filing of the petition setting forth the matters required by the code section noted vests jurisdiction in the probate court. <em>(Security-First Nat. Bank </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>1 Cal.2d 749 [37 P.2d 69].)</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">When the prescribed procedure is followed, notice that a proceeding is pending and will be had at a specified time and place is deemed to have been given to all interested parties. <em>(Estate of Hensel, </em>144 Cal.App.2d 429 [301 P.2d 105].)</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">In <em>Abels </em>v. <em>Frey, </em>126 Cal.App. 48, at pages 53-54 [14 P.2d 594], the court said: \u201cBy giving the notice prescribed by the statute, the entire world is called before the court, and the court acquires jurisdiction over all persons for the purpose of determining their rights to any portion of the estate, and every person who may assert any right or interest therein is required to present his claim to the court for its determination. Whether he appears and presents his claim, or fails to appear, the action of the court is equally conclusive upon him 1 \u201csubject only to be[ing] reversed, set aside, or modified on appeal\u201d \u2019. The decree is as binding upon him if he fails to appear and present his claim, as if his claim, after presentation, had been disallowed by the court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b674-8\"><em>Security-First Nat. Bank </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>1 Cal.2d 749, is authority for the rule that the probate court, in a trust situation similar to the instant one, <em>has jurisdiction even if the beneficiaries are not served. </em> The last case is also authority that such an account, as herein, is binding on the remaindermen. See also Probate Code, section 1123, reading, \u201cA decree rendered under the provisions of this chapter, when it becomes final, shall be conclusive upon all persons in interest, whether or not they are in being. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b674-9\">It would appear the plaintiffs have mistaken their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>forum; they should have appealed from the orders settling the Annual Accounts of the Trustee. There is grave doubt that plaintiffs can now collaterally attack such orders <em>(Security-First Nat. Bank </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra) </em>but it may be that the record, here, is not absolutely conclusive. Therefore, we feel it proper to consider the second point, which latter was earnestly argued by both parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">\n<em>Was the trial court\u2019s construction of the will correct?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">The defendant\u2019s construction of the will is very simple: that Paragraph Sixth of the will is a direction to invade principal to make up the sum of $5,000 per year, and that the home was property included in the principal of the trust. This construction finds support in the failure to distinguish between the assets of the trust in Section Sixth, it referring only to \u201cthe principal of the Trust.\u201d Section Fourth devises and bequeaths in trust \u201c \u2018all of my real and personal estate whatsoever and wheresoever situate, not . . . otherwise specifically disposed of . . specifically mentioning the home in the next paragraph, clearly indicating that the home is to be part of the trust property. The termination clause also does not distinguish between the house and the income-producing property, referring only to the \u201cprincipal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">The plaintiffs\u2019 theory is based on a rather unusual approach. Keeping in mind that this is an appeal from a judgment entered upon the sustaining of a general demurrer without leave to amend, one would expect the plaintiffs to be arguing their allegations of fact to bring them into court.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-8\">Not so here. Plaintiffs must first persuade a court to adopt their construction of the will, and then their allegations of fact would come into play and become important. Thus, it is not surprising that both parties agree that what is before this court (subject to the above cited authorities on plaintiffs\u2019 mistake as to forum) is the construction of the will. It is axiomatic that construction of a will is a matter of law (26 Cal.Jur. 879) and both parties so agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-9\">The arguments of the plaintiffs are somewhat involved and a statement of some of the principles that have been laid down to guide in the construction of wills, and their applicability to the instant case, may be helpful.  The paramount rule in the construction of wills, to which all other rules must yield, is that a will is to be construed according to the intention of the testator. <em>(Estate of Newman, </em>68 Cal.App. 420 [229 P. 898].) In the instant ease the testatrix made her intent, concerning the invasion of the corpus of the trust <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>to make up the $5,000, unequivocally known, as far as the words of Section Sixth, standing alone, are concerned. In order to surmount this difficulty, plaintiffs seek to modify the words of Section Sixth by other words in the will. To do this one must, by construction, qualify the clear language of the section.  A construction of a will which gives effect to every expression is to be preferred to one which will render some term or provision inoperative. (Prob. Code, \u00a7 102; <em>Estate of Mollon, </em>34 Cal.App.2d 147 [93 P.2d 245].)  A clear or distinct devise or bequest cannot be affected by inference or arguments from other parts of the instrument. (Prob. Code, \u00a7 104; <em>Estate of Moorehouse, </em>64 Cal.App.2d 210 [148 P.2d 385]; <em>Estate of Salmonski, </em>38 Cal.2d 199 [238 P.2d 966].)</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">Bearing in mind the above rules, an analysis of the plaintiffs\u2019 position is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">Plaintiffs first argue, relying on the principle of construction that several testamentary instruments are to be construed together (Prob. Code, \u00a7 101), that all the instruments viewed together show a consistent dispositive plan \u201cto benefit plaintiffs or some one of them.\u201d It is clear that the plaintiffs were to benefit after James\u2019 death or remarriage. However, there is also a clear intent shown by Section Sixth to provide James with $5,000 per year until one or the other event should terminate his tenancy. The former intent cannot be said to prevail over the latter, inasmuch as the testatrix expressly empowered the trustee to do those acts which could only result in defeat to the plaintiffs\u2019 interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">Secondly, plaintiffs argue that the interpretation given the will by the trial court gives no effect to \u201cthe specific mandate that her home be kept \u2018intact.\u2019 \u201d The will gives the property in trust for the purpose of \u201cpermit[ting] my husband, James Leslie Boulton, to occupy rent free my home . . .; together with the furnishings and household appurtenances therein belonging and located. Said home to be kept intact for his use until his death or remarriage.\u201d This direction could mean that the house is to be kept \u201cas is\u201d with its furnishings for James\u2019 use during his lifetime; or that the surrounding land was not to be subdivided and sold, as defendant suggests. It would seem a strained construction to derive from the word \u201cintact\u201d in this context the intention that this property was to be exempted from the general provisions of Section Sixth, as plaintiffs do.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-8\">Plaintiffs also cite <em>Estate of Markham, </em>28 Cal.2d 69, 74 [168 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>P.2d 669], holding that a provision, that payments shall he made from the net income of the trust property \u201ccompels the conclusion that neither the corpus nor income in future years may be used unless there is a clear expression to the contrary in the trust instrument. \u2019 \u2019 Inasmuch as there is such a direction in Section Sixth, this case would be inapplicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">Plaintiffs next argue that from the direction in the last codicil that \u201cI hereby request the Trustee to retain the El Paseo Building as part of this trust estate so long as it may be possible to do so, bu[t] said Trustee shall at all times have the power in its absolute discretion to dispose of said building for the best interests of this trust estate\u201d was a recognition that \u201cthe power of sale given applied only to the income-producing property, if at all\u201d and \u201cclearly indicates that the power to sell the homestead was forbidden in any event.\u201d This provision would only seem to indicate that, for some reason, the testatrix thought it was especially desirable to retain this building. It does not forbid the sale of other parts of the estate, and does not revoke either Section Sixth, or Section Fifth giving the power to manage and dispose of all the trust property. The codicil was executed September 4, 1931, about a month before the testatrix\u2019 death on November 6,1931. The real property in the estate included the El Paseo Building, three lots, and a one-half interest in the home. The direction concerning the retention of the El Paseo Building would only seem to indicate that the testatrix believed the lots should be sold before the building if a sale of the corpus was necessary to make up the $5,000 payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">Plaintiffs also argue that the spendthrift provisions in Section Seventh indicate that \u201cthe testatrix intended that no beneficiary should be permitted to pauperize himself, particularly with respect to the rent free use of the homestead.\u201d Section Seventh provides in part: \u201c[A] 11 of the income <em>and/or principal </em>under this trust shall be transferable, payable and deliverable only, solely, exclusively and personally to the above designated beneficiaries hereunder at the time entitled to take the same under the terms of this trust . . .\u201d The testatrix seemed to have no objection to the beneficiaries pauperizing themselves, so long as they did it at the rate of $5,000 per year.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">All of the allegations in the complaint concerning election under the will depend upon the adoption of plaintiffs\u2019 construction of the will. If the construction adopted by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>trial court is followed, the absorption of the corpus and income by James at the rate of $5,000 per year is not inconsistent with electing to take under the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">The will contained a direction that the \u201c [s] aid Homestead shall be maintained by my trustees who shall expend out of income not exceed [sic] $150.00 per month on same.\u201d The complaint alleged that the actual expenditure by the trustee for maintenance was less than $1,000.00, and that James \u201ccaused said homestead to deteriorate.\u201d Although it is not expressly alleged, it might be inferred from these allegations that this sum was necessary to keep the home in the condition it was at the time of the testatrix\u2019 death. However, it cannot be said that not expending $150 per month on maintenance was a breach of the trust. The $150 was a ceiling on the amount to be spent, not a minimum, and there is no express direction that the house had to be maintained so as to retain the relative value it had at the time of the testatrix\u2019 death. Section Fifth provides that the trustee \u201cmay generally handle, manage, operate and dispose of the whole or any portion of the trust estate in such securities, properties, or manner, and upon such terms and conditions as I might or could do, if living, or which said Trustee may deem most advisable. \u2019 \u2019 The trustee might reasonably deem it most advisable to expend minimum maintenance on the home so as to keep it within the trust estate as long as possible. If $18,000 had been expended on the home during the period from 1931 to 1941, the husband\u2019s claim for income might well have swallowed up the whole of the trust estate in 1941. Although the husband outlived the value of the corpus, the trustee\u2019s actions, at the time they were performed, would seem to have been directed at conserving the estate of the remaindermen as much as possible.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">The trial court\u2019s construction of the portion of the will setting up the trust appears to have been correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">The defendant advances the contention that, even under the plaintiffs\u2019 construction of the will, the alleged representations of the husband were not actionable. In view of the previous determinations, we make no holding on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">Judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-8\">Peters, P. J., and Bray, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b671-15\"> Assigned by Chairman of Judicial Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
