In fulfilling our responsibility to conduct an independent review of the weight of the evidence (see CPL 470.15 [5]; <em>People v Danielson, </em>9 NY3d 342 [2007]), we nevertheless accord great deference to the factfinder\u2019s opportunity to view the witnesses, hear the testimony, and observe demeanor (see <em>People v Mateo, </em>2 NY3d 383, 410 [2004], <em>cert denied </em>542 US 946 [2004]; <em>People v Bleakley, </em>69 NY2d 490, 495 [1987]). Upon reviewing the record here, we are satisfied that the verdict of guilt was not against the weight of the evidence (see <em>People v Romero, </em>7 NY3d 633 [2006]). Santucci, J.P., Dickerson, Eng and Chambers, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
