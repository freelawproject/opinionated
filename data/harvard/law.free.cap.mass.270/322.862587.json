In each case a verdict was directed for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-17\">It appeared that the town of Winthrop made a contract with Sargent to widen Revere Street, which was a public way. There was no \u201cformal vote of the selectmen . . . closing Revere Street.\u201d Sargent began work \u201cafter Labor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>Day in September, 1926.\u201d Number 440 Revere Street is on the westerly side, and its location was opposite that part of the street which was to be widened in accordance with the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">The plaintiff testified as follows: On October 3, 1926, she was on her way with her grandson to see a Mrs. Buonomo; there was a barrier at the bridge at Revere Street with two red fights on it, and they walked into the street, \u201cthen they stepped up on the walk that led them on down to number 440.\u201d The house had been moved back. The plaintiff found no one at home and started to return. She was on the sidewalk when she fell. She stepped on. a place which seemed to be \u201cperfectly firm\u201d and when she put her weight \u201cinto it, it went down and let her right forward.\u201d The hole was \u201ca foot square and about eight or ten inches deep.\u201d She did not notice that the sidewalk was under construction, but did notice that the street was being repaired. As we understand the testimony of the plaintiff the barrier was on that portion of the street which had been used for vehicular travel, but it did not extend to the sidewalk.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">There was further evidence that the wooden horse or barrier was \u201cin the middle of the street\u201d and \u201cwasn\u2019t over the sidewalk\u201d; that the hole into which the plaintiff fell was covered with dirt \u201cbut it wasn\u2019t tightened\u201d; that the old curbstones had been removed leaving a trench, and the place where the plaintiff fell was at the point where the curbstone had been removed; that where the curbstone had been removed the hole had been filled.with gravel but \u201cit wasn\u2019t solid.\u201d It also appeared that a contractor other than Sargent had a contract with the town of Winthrop to remove the curbstones on the westerly side of Revere Street. The statutory notice of the time, place and cause of the accident was given to the defendant town.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">There was evidence of the plaintiff\u2019s care; and there were facts for the consideration of the jury tending to show that the sidewalk was not reasonably safe for travel. The town knew that repair work was going on at the place of the accident, and the responsibility rested on it to see that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>the way was reasonably safe. <em>Burt </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>122 Mass. 223. <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>189 Mass. 7. <em>Stoliker </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>204 Mass. 522. <em>Connelly </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>206 Mass. 4. See <em>Brooks </em>v. <em>Somerville, </em>106 Mass. 271, 274.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">The duty of the town to keep the sidewalk reasonably safe for travel was not removed by delegating this duty to the contractor. <em>Brooks </em>v. <em>Somerville, supra. Stoliker </em>v. <em>Boston, supra. </em>There was evidence that the sidewalk was not closed for travel; that no work had been done on the sidewalk at the place of the accident except the removal of the curbstone; and it was not apparent that the sidewalk was under repair and not fit for travel. <em>Cody </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>258 Mass. 267, <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>266 Mass. 262, and similar cases, are not applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">We are unable to find any evidence of Sargent\u2019s negligence. He did not remove the curbstones; he did not undertake the duty of keeping the sidewalk safe for travel; and there was evidence that he had exercised no supervision over the contractor who did in fact remove the curbstones. For these reasons <em>Coles </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Maine Railroad, </em>223 Mass. 408, is to be distinguished.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">The plaintiff relies on a clause in the contract of the town with Sargent to the effect that Sargent was to keep the westerly sidewalk open and safe for travel at all times. But the plaintiff was not a party to this contract; and in the absence of evidence that Sargent had undertaken the work of repairing the sidewalk and keeping it open and safe for travel, see <em>Stoliker </em>v. <em>Boston, supra, </em>the plaintiff cannot recover against him merely because of his contract with the town. See <em>Davidson </em>v. <em>Nichols, </em>11 Allen, 514, 517.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">In <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Winthrop </em>the exceptions are sustained; in <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Sargent </em>they are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-9\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
