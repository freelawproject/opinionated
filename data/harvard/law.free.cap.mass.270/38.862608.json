A witness called by the defendant, in answer to a question whether he heard the plaintiff request the defendant to go slowly, said that he did not know whether it was said or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>not. The presiding judge asked the witness, in substance, \"if he did not think he would remember if the plaintiff had said it. To this remark the plaintiff duly excepted, claiming that it was prejudicial.\u201d Apparently the question was not answered. Whether this be regarded as an unanswered inquiry or whether it be assumed that it was answered, no error is disclosed. The presiding judge had a right to put the question. <em>Palmer </em>v. <em>White, </em>10 Cush. 321. <em>Sherman </em>v. <em>Sherman, </em>193 Mass. 400. <em>Benuliewicz </em>v.
