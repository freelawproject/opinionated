Petitioner commenced employment with defendant as a high school teacher in September 1966 and continued in that position through the 1967-1968 school year, at which time he was employed by defendant as an \u2022 attendance counselor. He served as an attendance counselor through the 1971-1972 school year and acquired tenure (e.g., permanent status) with defendant while serving in that position. In March 1972 petitioner was informed that he was being reassigned as a classroom teacher for the 1972-1973 school year which involved a reduction in salary of over $500 per month. He sought a hearing to contest the reassignment, but was informed that he was not entitled to a hearing because none was required in the case of reassignment as opposed to termination. Petitioner accepted the reassignment, though under protest, and has continued to teach, while still seeking reinstatement as a counselor.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-4\">Petitioner filed the instant petition for writ of mandate to compel defendant to reinstate him as a counselor. The trial court denied the writ, finding the facts to be as stated above and concluding as a matter of law that petitioner\u2019s services had not been terminated, rather he had been reassigned to other duties and such reassignment was within the lawful authority of defendant. Petitioner appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">The central question presented by this appeal is whether a permanent employee holding dual certificates, in this case teacher and counselor certificates, may be reassigned from counselor to classroom teacher by the school district without complying with the Education Code sections delineating the causes for and procedures by which a permanent employee may be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">It is well established that school districts in the normal course of administration have broad powers to reassign their permanent employees to different positions, including positions involving a reduction in. pay and prestige, subject only to two requirements: (1) reasonableness <em>{Adelt </em>v. <em>Richmond Sch. Dist. </em>(1967) 250 Cal.App.2d 149, 152 [58 Cal.Rptr. 151]; <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Board of Trustees </em>(1935) 5 Cal.App.2d 64, 69 [42 P.2d 397]) and (2) that the reassigned position be \u201cwithin the scope of the certificate under which tenure was acquired\u201d <em>{Adelt, supra, </em>at p. 152) or \u201cthe work assigned is of a rank and grade equivalent to that by which the permanent status was acquired.\u201d <em>{Mitchell, supra, </em>at p. 69; accord <em>Leithliter </em>v. <em>Board of Trustees </em>(1970) 12 Cal.App.3d 1095, 1100-1101 [91 Cal.Rptr. 215]; see <em>Lacy </em>v. <em>Richmond Unified Sch. Dist. </em>(1975) 13 Cal.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>469, 475, fn. 4 [119 Cal.Rptr. 1, 530 P.2d 1377].) Thus, in order to determine the propriety of a reassignment it is necessary to ascertain \u201cthe certificate under which tenure was acquired\u201d or \u201cthe rank and grade\u201d at which permanent status was acquired.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">Section 44882 of the Education Code provides<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that an employee who has been employed by the school district for three consecutive years in a position requiring certification acquires permanent status as an employee at the beginning of the next school year. The section does not provide at what rank or grade permanent status, if any, is acquired. Employees holding only a classroom teacher certificate (e.g., general secondary credential) who are employed throughout their probationary period as classroom teachers, acquire permanent status as classroom teachers. Employees holding only a counseling certificate (e.g., general pupil personnel credential) who are employed throughout their probationary period as counselors, acquire permanent status as counselors. <em>(Otto </em>v. <em>Davie </em>(1973) 34 Cal.App.3d 570, 578 [110 Cal.Rptr. 114]; see <em>Netwig </em>v. <em>Huntington Beach Union High Sch. Dist. </em>(1975) 52 Cal.App.3d 529, 532 [125 Cal.Rptr. 170]; \u00a7\u00a7 44894, 44895.)</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">Employees holding more than one certificate present something of a problem.  Administrators, including certificated administrators who were employed as administrators at the time they acquired permanent status, acquire tenure only as classroom teachers, not administrators and can be reassigned from a position as an administrator to one as classroom teacher. <em>(Council of Directors and Supervisors </em>v. <em>Los Angeles Unified Sch. Dist. </em>(1973) 35 Cal.App.3d 147, 152 [110 Cal.Rptr. 624]; <em>Hentschke </em>v. <em>Sink </em>(1973) 34 Cal.App.3d 19, 22-23 [109 Cal.Rptr. 549]; \u00a7\u00a7 44893, 44897.)  Classroom teachers, also holding counseling certificates, who served their entire probationary period as classroom teachers and then were subsequently assigned to positions as counselors, acquire permanent status only as classroom teachers, not as counselors, and can be reassigned from a position as a counselor to one as a classroom teacher. <em>(Netwig </em>v. <em>Huntington Beach Union High Sch. Dist., supra, </em>52 Cal.App.3d 529, 532; see <em>Leithliter </em>v. <em>Board of Trustees, supra, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>12 Cal.App.3d 1095, 1099, fn. 8.) No case authority has been brought to our attention which determines what tenure is acquired when an employee who holds both teacher and counselor certificates and completes his probationary period as a counselor, either having served the full probationary period as a counselor or, as in this case, having commenced the probationary period as a teacher and completed it as a counselor.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b657-4\"> However, at least with respect to such employees acquiring \"tenure after 1972,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> there has been a legislative solution, since in 1972 the Legislature enacted section 44894,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which provides in effect that employees holding both teaching and counseling certificate shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>acquire permanent status only as a classroom teacher and not as counselors. The Legislature thereby afforded counselors and administrators the same treatment, namely permanent status as classroom teachers, with the exception that counselors who did not also have teaching certificates would acquire permanent status as counselors. The Legislature in enacting this section stated that it was passed in order \u201cto clarify the rights of permanent certificated employees,\u201d (Stats. 1972, ch. 795, \u00a7 10, p. 1417) suggesting that the section involved a clarification of the existing law rather than a change thereof. Indeed petitioner has not presented any authority to the contraiy which would suggest that employees holding both teaching and counseling certificates would acquire permanent status as counselors.  We hold that an employee with both teaching and counseling certificates acquires permanent status as a classroom teacher regardless of the position held by that employee at the completion of the probationaiy period. Therefore petitioner acquired tenure as a classroom teacher.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">Having concluded that petitioner acquired tenure as a classroom teacher, under the prevailing rule described earlier in this opinion petitioner could be reassigned from a position as a counselor to one as a classroom teacher subject only to the requirement of reasonableness. <em>(Netwig </em>v. <em>Huntington Beach Union High Sch. Dist., supra, </em>52 Cal.App.3d 529, 532; <em>Leithliter v. Board of Trustees, supra, </em>12 Cal.App.3d 1095, 1100-1101; <em>Adelt </em>v. <em>Richmond Sch. Dist., supra, </em>250 Cal.App.2d 149, 152; <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Board of Trustees, supra, </em>5 Cal.App.2d 64, 69; see <em>Lacy </em>v. <em>Richmond Unified Sch. Dist., supra, </em>13 Cal.3d 469, 475, fn. 4.)  Petitioner seeks to avoid this conclusion by contending that, at least with reference to reassignment of counselors involving a reduction in pay and prestige, section 44955<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> prohibits such reassignment</p>\n<p id=\"b659-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>to classroom teaching positions unless it is for cause pursuant to section 44933 or to effect a reduction in the number of permanent employees pursuant to the procedures set forth in section 44955. Petitioner seeks to reach this conclusion by asserting that to reassign an employee from counselor to classroom teacher is to \u201cdeprive him of his position\u201d within the meaning of that phrase in the initial sentence of section 44955. This contention has no merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-4\">First, all the code sections referred to in the first paragraph of section 44955 refer to dismissal of permanent or probationary employees or to termination of their services pursuant to section 44955 itself. Therefore it is clear that \u201cdeprived of his position\u201d refers to dismissal or termination of services. Accordingly, it has been held that section 44955 has no application to the reassignment or demotion of administrators to the position of classroom teacher. <em>(Council of Directors and Supervisors </em>v. <em>Los Angeles Unified Sch. Dist., supra, </em>35 Cal.App.3d 147, 152; see <em>Hentschke </em>v. <em>Sink, supra, </em>34 Cal.App.3d 19, 22-23.) Moreover, section 44955 was in effect and contained the relevant language concerning \u201cdeprivation of position\u201d at the time the general rule was established that school districts may reassign permanent employees to any position within the scope of the certificate under which they acquired permanent status subject only to the requirement of reasonableness. <em>(Netwig </em>v. <em>Huntington Beach Union High Sch. Dist., supra, </em>52 Cal.App.3d 529, 532; <em>Hentschke </em>v. <em>Sink, supra, </em>34 Cal.App.3d 19, 22-23; <em>Leithliter </em>v. <em>Board of Trustees, supra, </em>12 Cal.App.3d 1095, 1100-1101; <em>Adelt </em>v. <em>Richmond Sch. Dist., supra, </em>250 Cal.App.2d 149, 152.)</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">Second, section 44955 was enacted to authorize school districts to terminate employment of permanent employees in order to reduce their number when there has been a reduction in the number of students or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>when it is necessary to reduce or discontinue a particular kind of service and to provide the procedures by which this reduction may be effected. <em>(Lacy </em>v. <em>Richmond Unified Sch. Dist., supra, </em>13 Cal.3d 469; <em>Teacher Dismissals Under Section 13447 of the California Education Code </em>(1976) 27 Hastings L.J. 1401, 1402.) Section 44955 only comes into play once the school district has decided to terminate the services of certain permanent employees in order to reduce the number of employees because of a reduction in the number of students or in order to reduce or discontinue a type of service. <em>(Lacy </em>v. <em>Richmond Unified Sch. Dist., supra, </em>13 Cal.3d 469, 475.) Once the school district has determined a need to effect a reduction in the number of permanent employees, it must then comply with the procedures set forth in section 44955, which requires among other things that the school district must effect such termination in order of seniority. <em>(Lacy, supra, </em>at pp. 473-474; <em>Krausen </em>v. <em>Solano County Junior College Dist. </em>(1974) 42 Cal.App.3d 394, 402 [116 Cal.Rptr. 833]; see <em>Otto </em>v. <em>Davie, supra, </em>34 Cal.App.3d 570, 575-576.) \u201cIt [section 44955] contains a mandatory directive to the board to determine whether any employee whose employment is to be terminated for a reduction in attendance or for a reduction in a particular type of service possessed the seniority and qualifications which would entitle him to be assigned to another position. It seems clear that the provision in question does confer seniority rights and bumping privileges upon probationary, as well as permanent, employees. The provision has been interpreted to mean \u2018that when a [particular] service is eliminated [or reduced] the holder of the position is not necessarily terminated, but is entitled to another assignment to which his seniority and qualifications entitle him.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Krausen, supra, </em>42 Cal.App.3d at p. 402.) Section 44955 applies to reassignments only after the school board has determined to terminate the services of a permanent employee pursuant to section 44955 and then only to assure that that employee, if entitled so by seniority and qualifications, be reassigned rather than terminated. The section has no application to normal reassignments of permanent employees. <em>(Lacy </em>v. <em>Richmond Unified Sch. Dist., supra, </em>13 Cal.3d 469, 475.) It is clear from the record, as is in fact urged by petitioner, that the school district did not effect his reassignment pursuant to section 44955.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Since petitioner was not reassigned pursuant to section 44955 following termination of his services as a counselor, he was not entitled to the procedures compelled by that section.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-4\">Bird, C. J., Tobriner, J., Mosk, J., Clark, J., Richardson, J., and Sullivan, J.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b656-7\"> \u201cEvery employee of a school district of any type or class having an average daily attendance of 250 or more who, after having been employed by the district for three complete consecutive school years in a position or positions requiring certification qualifications, is reelected for the next succeeding school year to to a position requiring certification qualifications shall, at the commencement of the succeeding school year be classified as and become a permanent employee of the district.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b656-8\">Hereafter, unless otherwise noted, all section references are to the Reorganized Education Code, added by Statutes 1976, chapter 1010, amended by Statutes 1976, chapter 1011, operative April 30, 1977.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b657-5\">In <em>Otto </em>v. <em>Davie, supra, </em>34 Cal.App.3d 570, the employee held both a teaching and a counseling certificate and had served the full probationary period as a counselor, but he had filed only his counseling certificate, not his teaching certificate, pursuant to section 13163, and thus was treated by the court as holding only a single certificate as a counselor. In <em>Lacy </em>v. <em>Richmond Unified Sch. Dist., supra, </em>13 Cal.3d 469, 475, the employee apparently had both a teaching and counseling certificate and had served the probationary period as a counselor, but the court specifically did not address itself to the tenure issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b657-6\">Since the Legislature did'not expressly declare the section was to have retroactive effect <em>(DiGenova </em>v. <em>State Board of Education </em>(1962) 57 Cal.2d 167, 174 [18 Cal.Rptr. 369, 367 P.2d 865]) and since nothing has been brought to our attention which would indicate that the Legislature nonetheless intended retroactive application <em>{In re Marriage of Bouquet </em>(1976) 16 Cal.3d 583, 587 [128 Cal.Rptr. 427, 546 P.2d 1371]), we conclude the section would not have retroactive effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">Petitioner has directed our attention to <em>Klein </em>v. <em>Board of Education </em>(1934) 1 Cal.2d 706 [37 P.2d 74], in support of his contention that the 1972 legislation cannot be applied retroactively because to do so would result in the impairment of a vested right. Whatever may be the continued vitality of <em>Klein, </em>it is clear that it has no application here in light of our holdings that petitioner has no tenured position as a counselor and that section 44894 was not intended to be applied retroactively.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b657-8\">Section 44894 provides: \u201c(a) A permanent employee not qualified to render service as a classroom teacher, when advanced to an administrative or supervisory position, or assigned any special or other type of work, or given special classification or designation requiring certification qualifications, shall retain his permanent classification for the performance of the type of service for which he was qualified prior to such advancement, assignment, or special classification or designation.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-9\">\u201c(b) If an employee is authorized to render service in more than one type of position for which certification qualific\u00e1tions are required, either by virtue of his possession of one certification document authorizing service in two or more of such positions, or by virtue of his possession of separate certification documents authorizing service in two or more such positions, or any combination thereof, he shall, upon satisfying all other requirements prescribed by law, acquire permanent status as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b657-10\">\u201c(1) If he is authorized to render service as a classroom teacher, he shall acquire permanent status as a classroom teacher.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-11\">\u201c(2) If he is not authorized to render service as a classroom teacher, he shall acquire permanent status below the administrative or supervisory level as a staff employee with multiple qualifications.
