Fasken, who died in 1968 while a resident of California. Decedent devised and bequeathed her entire estate, consisting of real and tangible personal property located in California and Texas, to her son David Fasken, the executor herein. He objected to the report of the inheritance tax referee purporting to determine death taxes due pursuant to provisions of the Revenue and Taxation Code. The court sustained the objections and fixed the tax at an amount $463,858 less than that claimed by the Controller. The estate has paid the tax as so fixed.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">At issue is the validity of the California procedure for calculation of that element of the tax which arises out of a federal \u201ccredit\u201d of a portion of the federal estate tax, when such credit is allocable to California and one or more other states. The California procedure is prescribed in a regulation which is set out in the margin.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>\n                   We have concluded for reasons which follow that the regulation infringes jurisdictional limitations under federal due process concepts and that the trial court fixed the tax at its jurisdictional limit. We accordingly affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">Because this case springs from a complicated and evolving relationship between federal and state tax law which empowers California to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>\u201cpick up\u201d tax revenue made available through a federal credit, it is helpful in the ascertainment of congressional and legislative intent to review pertinent statutory and case law developments in this area.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">\n<em>Development of Rules Relative to \u201cPick-up\u201d Taxes</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">Since 1916 section 2001 of the Internal Revenue Code<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> has imposed a federal estate tax on all specifically nonexempt (see Int. Rev. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 2011-2014, 2052-2056) property owned by persons residing in the United States at the time of their death. In the early years following enactment of the federal estate tax, a backlash of opposition emerged in Congress and among various other high placed government officials to the very concept of the federal government taxing a person\u2019s property at death.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Concurrent with this attitude of general resentment for the federal government\u2019s incursion into an area providing \u201ca traditional source of revenue to the states\u201d (Turner, <em>The Gross Estate and the Death Tax Credit </em>(1971) 28 Wash. &amp; Lee L.Rev. 254, 257 [hereafter cited as <em>Turner]), </em>several states nevertheless repealed long-standing death tax statutes,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201cthis being done to induce wealthy persons to move within their borders.\u201d <em>(Cogburn </em>at p. 123.)</p>\n<p id=\"b450-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>Congressional response took form in the Revenue Act of 1924 (ch. 234, \u00a7 301(b), 43 Stat. 253, 304) giving birth to what-is now commonly referred to as the federal estate credit for state death taxes. (Int. Rev. Code, \u00a72011.)  Section 2011, subdivision (a) of the Internal Revenue Code permits legal representatives of estates to deduct from the total federal estate tax obligation* ***<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> a limited, scheduled<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> credit for all death taxes actually paid<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> to any state on account of property taxable as part of the gross federal estate.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Architects of the credit clearly intended individual states to benefit from its creation, for section 2011 assures states a certain minimum of tax revenue at the expense of the federal treasury.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">The original version of section 2011 set the federal state death tax credit at a maximum of 25 percent. Although a decedent\u2019s estate located in a state without a death tax would still'incur the same federal liability as an estate situated in a state which imposed the tax, existence of the federal credit enabled all states for the first time to share in receipt of federally assessed tax revenue merely by enacting or amending their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>existing laws to pick up the federal credit.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Despite this incentive for states to take advantage of available tax revenue, dilatory and even contrary legislative action by some states quickly dispelled any notion that the 25 percent credit would provide a panacea for alleviation of resentment to federal government involvement or elimination of interstate death tax competition.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> One commentator explained the situation that prevailed following passage of the 25 percent credit in 1924: \u201c[D]ue to the action of some states, it became apparent that if this matter were left solely to the states, competition would arise among the several states to revoke or lower their death taxes in an attempt to lure wealthy elders into those states with lower or non-existent death tax burdens.\u201d <em>{Turner, </em>at pp. 257-258.) In 1926, therefore, Congress raised the federal tax credit to a maximum level of 80 percent (4 CCH Inheritance, Estate and Gift Tax Reporter, \u00a7 2500, p. 80,421) as a further attempt \u201cto induce states to enact laws imposing death taxes.\u201d <em>{Cogburn, </em>at p. 124.)</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">By more than tripling the maximum available federal state death tax credit, Congress achieved a lasting solution to the twin problems of interstate death tax competition and general opposition to federal death taxation.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> When state legislatures finally realized that the federal government actually intended to divert from its own treasury to individual state coffers vast sums of federally assessed tax revenue, the response was overwhelming: interstate death tax competition soon vanished, and at the present time every state in the nation except Nevada <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>and the Eiakotas levies death taxes which at least exhaust the state death tax credit. (4 CCH Inheritance, Estate and Gift Taxes Reporter, Multistate Compendium, pp. 70,111 - 70,633: If 1100, p. 80,041.) Enactment of a state death tax credit enabling states to acquire all but 20 percent of estate tax revenues previously retained entirely by the federal government, moreover, placated critics of federal involvement in the death tax area by satisfying their \u201cclamor for the abolition of Federal death taxation.\u201d <em>(Cogbum, </em>at p. 125.) Having placated its critics, however, Congress wasted little time in enacting an additional estate tax not subject to any credit, and the current credit as now scheduled in Internal Revenue Code section 2011 results from a combination of the two estate taxes in the 1954 recodification of the code with the credit never exceeding 16 percent of the combined tax. (See fn. 6, <em>ante.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">Obviously cognizant of federal determination to furnish states with a larger portion of estate tax revenue, our Legislature adopted a pick-up tax in 1927 (Rev. &amp; Tax. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 13441, 13442) calculated to assure this state its full share of the credit for state death taxes.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> If an inheritance tax obligation falls short of the maximum credit for state death taxes scheduled in section 2011 of the Internal Revenue Code, section 13441 of the Revenue and Taxation Code imposes a pick-up tax equal to the difference.  Section 13441, moreover, has been construed in the absence of multistate claims to the federal credit as vesting the state with an independent right to receive the entire credit differential between the allowable<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> state death tax credit and state death taxes, with or without the benefit of the enabling authority of section 2011 of the Internal Revenue .Code, irrespective of whether a decedent\u2019s estate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>waived the credit and paid the full estate tax to federal authorities,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and even though compliance with the state\u2019s demand forces the estate to assume the onus of double taxation.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>{Estate of Good, supra, </em>213 Cal.App.2d 45, 48-50; see also <em>Estate of Callaway </em>(1968) 263 Cal.App.2d 795, 798-801 [69 Cal.Rptr. 921]; <em>Estate of Amar </em>(1967) 255 Cal.App.2d 404, 407-409 [63 Cal.Rptr. 444]; accord <em>Wells </em>v. <em>Gay </em>(Fla. 1952) 58 So.2d 690; <em>State </em>v. <em>Weiss </em>(1943) 141 Tex. 303 [171 S.W.2d 848, 147 A.L.R. 460]; <em>Matter of Thalmann </em>(1941) 177 Misc. 1055 [32 N.Y.S.2d 695].)</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">\n<em>The Conflict in Claims to the State Death Tax Credit</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">Although <em>Good, Amar, Callaway </em>and other decisions by sister states firmly establish state individual entitlement to the full credit differential, even when both federal and state payments are thereby forced upon a taxpayer, these cases do not by themselves substantiate the Controller\u2019s present claim for unpaid taxes. The executor in the instant case does not dispute a state\u2019s authority to levy a pick-up \"tax covering the full credit differential when all tangible estate property is located in one state. He argues instead that California purports to tax only a pro rata share of the full credit differential in an estate having multistate property, but utilizes a constitutionally impermissible apportionment to determine that share.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">The regulation urged by the Controller as warranting the challenged procedures was promulgated in its present form in 1945. It purports to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>implement the same federal objective of picking up tax revenue made available to states as do the statutes adopted by legislative action in 1927. It is concerned, however, with only those particular estates, like decedent\u2019s in the present case, which consist of both California and out-of-state property. The governing statutes, on the other hand, do not expressly deal with such particular situations. The regulation, accordingly, provides for the application of statutes in a particular situation in which the statutes are silent.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">In the instant case California exercises uncontested jurisdiction over estate property having a value of $11,384,060.34 representing 45.313 percent of the total worth of the estate. Texas assessed \u201cnonresident\u201d inheritance taxes against property having a worth of $13,631,515.16, representing of the total worth 54.6869 percent of the estate.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Following the inheritance tax referee\u2019s report of death taxes due the State of California in the amount of $2,007,765.19 ($1,509,279.32 in inheritance taxes and $498,485.87 in pick-up taxes) the executor complained inter alia that should the pick-up tax be fixed in the reported amount it would constitute \u201ca deprivation of. . . property without due process of law\u201d in violation of state and federal constitutional guarantees.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The court fixed the pick-up tax at $34,627.87, $463,858 less than that reported by the referee.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>The executor has paid the entire sum of $1,863,291.14 in death taxes as assessed by Texas authorities. According to the executor the estate\u2019s total California death tax liability should amount to no more than the credit for federal state death taxes ($3,407,198.33) less the total death taxes assessed by and paid to Texas ($1,863,291.14), that amount being $1,543,907.19. As the California inheritance tax represents $1,509,279.32 of this amount, the pick-up tax should be the balance, $34,627.87. The executor relies on substantive due process limitations as requiring the analysis he urges, and we next examine such limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">\n<em>Jurisdictional Due Process Limitations on a State\u2019s Power to Levy Death Taxes</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">The executor focuses his attack on what he claims to be jurisdictional excesses in the pick-up tax as calculated pursuant to the regulation. Our research reveals that the United States Supreme Court has on only three occasions addressed itself to issues bearing on the constitutionality of death taxes. In two of such instances the court held there to be a constitutional infringement when a state law attempted to impose on out-of-state property either a direct or an indirect tax which would interfere with the right of the state in which such property was located to collect revenue attributable thereto.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">In <em>Frick </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania </em>(1925) 268 U.S. 473 [69 L.Ed. 1058, 45 S.Ct. 603, 42 A.L.R. 316], the high court invalidated a segment of Pennsylvania\u2019s death tax law which sought to impose exactions on tangible property, the largest part of which consisted of a New York City art collection. Acknowledging that the issue was one of first impression, the court held that \u201cwhile a State may so shape its tax laws as to reach every object which is under its jurisdiction, it cannot give them any extraterritorial operation.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 489 [69 L.Ed. at p. 1062].) <em>Frick </em>thus stands for the proposition that a <em>direct </em>tax on out-of-state taxable personal and real <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>property constitutes a reach of constitutionally impermissible dimensions.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">In its final decision dealing with the permissible reach of a state death tax the Supreme Court denounced a 30 percent emergency tax enacted to fund World War II rehabilitation projects and calculated as a surtax on the Wisconsin death tax. <em>(Treichler </em>v. <em>Wisconsin </em>(1949) 338 U.S. 251 [94 L.Ed. 37, 70 S.Ct. 1].) In <em>Treichler </em>there was a federal credit for state death taxes of $630,709.62. The Wisconsin inheritance tax was $220,682.12 and the combined inheritance taxes on property of the decedent in Florida and Illinois were $57,325.71, leaving a total credit differential of $352,701.79. Wisconsin claimed the whole of the credit differential as a pick-up tax, designated by the Wisconsin statute as an \u201cestate tax.\u201d No proper challenge was made to such claim, and the Supreme Court held <em>only </em>that the <em>emergency tax </em>offended due process. That tax was calculated as 30 percent of the Wisconsin death tax (the sum of the inheritance and pick-up taxes), but because Wisconsin purported to pick up <em>all </em>of the credit differential its death tax was the equivalent of the federal credit for state death taxes less the combined inheritance taxes of Florida and Illinois.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">Although the basis for the disapproval of the Wisconsin emergency tax is not clearly stated, we read the opinion to hold that because the federal credit for state death taxes is \u201crated and measured by the entire estate, regardless of situs,\u201d no state can assert a claim to <em>all </em>of that credit when some taxable portion of the estate is located in another state. <em>{Treichler </em>v. <em>Wisconsin, supra, </em>338 U.S. 251, 254 [94 L.Ed. 37, 41].) Likewise, Wisconsin could not measure its emergency tax as a percentage of the whole of that credit. It did not, of course, measure its emergency tax as a percentage of the whole of that credit, but rather as a percentage of the whole of that credit <em>less </em>the inheritance taxes assessed by Florida and Illinois. But the Supreme Court was nevertheless of the view that even though Wisconsin had made an allowance for the Florida and Illinois inheritance taxes, such allowance had \u201cno necessary relation to the proportion of property outside Wisconsin.\u201d <em>{Id., </em>at p. 255 [94 L.Ed. at p. 42].) Although it declined to express any opinion thereon, the Supreme Court noted that a \u201cdifferent question might be presented ... if the statute in question authorized\u201d computation to begin with only that precise portion of the federal credit for state death taxes which was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>attributable to tangible property in Wisconsin. <em>(Id., </em>fn. 3 [94 L.Ed. at p. 42].) The court concluded that Wisconsin had \u201cauthorized a tax on property rated and measured in part by tangible property, the situs of which was outside Wisconsin. . . . Wisconsin\u2019s statute may be more sophisticated than Pennsylvania\u2019s, but in terms of ultimate consequences this case and the <em>Frick </em>case are one.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> <em>(Id., </em>at p. 256 [94 L.Ed. at p. 42].)</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">After remand from the United States Supreme Court, Wisconsin recomputed its emergency tax. It determined that portion of the federal credit for death taxes attributable only to property within the borders of Wisconsin which basis it used for computation of the emergency tax. (See <em>Estate of Miller </em>(1950) 257 Wis. 439 [43 N.W.2d 428].) In a per curiam decision the United States Supreme Court affirmed the Wisconsin Supreme Court judgment on remand, insofar \u201cas the appeal attacks the validity of the computation of appellant\u2019s tax under the Wisconsin Emergency Tax on Inheritances.\u201d <em>(Treichler, Executor </em>v. <em>Wisconsin </em>(1950) 340 U.S. 868 [95 L.Ed. 633, 71 S.Ct. 120].) Insofar as the appeal attacked the Wisconsin pick-up tax, however, the appeal was dismissed, \u201cthat portion of the judgment of the Wisconsin Supreme Court resting on an adequate nonfederal ground.\u201d <em>(Id.)</em><footnotemark><em>21</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">Neither the United States Supreme Court <em>Treichler </em>opinions nor the reported opinions of the Wisconsin Supreme Court <em>(In re Miller\u2019s Estate </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>(1948) 254 Wis. 24 [35 N.W.2d 404], and <em>Estate of Miller, supra, </em>257 Wis. 439) disclose the \u201cadequate nonfederal ground\u201d upon which the United States Supreme Court declined to question the propriety of Wisconsin\u2019s pick-up tax. It is manifest, however, that although the Wisconsin pick-up tax was not under attack, it necessarily suffered from the same constitutional infirmity which rendered the emergency tax invalid. This follows from the fact that the emergency tax was but a fixed portion of the death tax. If the emergency tax was constitutionally defective because it reached property outside Wisconsin\u2019s borders, then the death tax, which was the basis for the measure of the emergency tax, necessarily also reached such outside property. As the inheritance tax component of the death tax was assessed only on property within Wisconsin\u2019s borders (see <em>Treichler </em>v. <em>Wisconsin, supra, </em>338 U.S. 251, 253 [94 L.Ed. 37, 41]) the remaining component, the pick-up tax, had to have been assessed against property lying at least in part outside Wisconsin. This was recognized by the Wisconsin Supreme Court when, on remand and recomputation of the emergency tax, the court recognized a computation factor which it described as \u201cWisconsin Estate Tax measured by property out of Wisconsin.\u201d <em>{Estate of Miller, supra, </em>257 Wis. 439, 441, fn. 1.) As noted above, the Wisconsin statute assessed the whole of the credit differential as a pick-up tax, although some part of the decedent\u2019s estate was located in both Florida and Illinois.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">The United States Supreme Court has not since <em>Treichler II </em>undertaken to- extend, withdraw or explain the limits of due process jurisdictional controls over state death taxes, including pick-up taxes. Because states assert their right to the federal state death tax credit by rules which are independently enacted and generally fail to take into consideration conflicting claims which may be asserted by sister states when multistate property is involved, and because the conflicts have been created by federal legislation which encourages the states to make such claims while not defining the limits thereto, the problem is peculiarly one which the United States Supreme Court can most effectively resolve. Although the high court has failed to act in this area it has indicated a more sympathetic view of the right of states to exact tax revenue in other related areas where formerly they were deemed to be limited by due process concepts. (See, e.g., <em>Standard Steel Co. </em>v. <em>Wash. Revenue Dept. </em>(1975) 419 U.S. 560 [42 L.Ed.2d 719, 95 S.Ct. 706]; <em>Nat. Bellas Hess </em>v. <em>Dept. of Revenue </em>(1967) 386 U.S. 753 [18 L.Ed.2d 505, 87 S.Ct. 1389]; <em>Scripto </em>v. <em>Carson </em>(1960) 362 U.S. 207 [4 L.Ed.2d 54, 80 S.Ct. 52]; <em>Williamson </em>v. <em>Lee Optical Co. </em>(1955) 348 U.S. 483 [99 L.Ed. 563, 75 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>461]; <em>Braniff Airways </em>v. <em>Nebraska Board </em>(1954) 347 U.S. 590 [98 L.Ed. 967, 74 S.Ct. 757]; <em>Nelson </em>v. <em>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. </em>(1941) 312 U.S. 359 [85 L.Ed. 888, 61 S.Ct. 586, 132 A.L.R. 475]; <em>U. S. </em>v. <em>Carolene Products Co. </em>(1938) 304 U.S. 144 [82 L.Ed. 1234, 58 S.Ct. 778]; see also <em>Sea-Land Service, Inc. </em>v. <em>County of Alameda </em>(1974) 12 Cal.3d 772 [117 Cal.Rptr. 448, 528 P.2d 56]; <em>Scandinavian Airlines Systems, Inc. </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles </em>(1961) 56 Cal.2d 11 [14 Cal.Rptr. 25, 363 P.2d 25].)</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">\n<em>Jurisdictional Excesses Under the California Regulation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">It seems clear, as pertinent to the issues at hand, that under prevailing decisions each of several states may levy against an estate consisting of multistate property, an inheritance tax measured by the property within that state\u2019s boundaries, the amount of which tax is not limited by or otherwise dependent in any way on the federal credit for state death taxes. Even a single state may levy and collect, without raising a jurisdictional question, an inheritance tax which, by itself, exceeds the federal credit. This is true because the state in assessing a true inheritance tax as defined herein (see fn. 4, <em>ante) </em>applies its taxing rate to only in-state property. A <em>state need not </em>apportion that element <em>of </em>its death tax which consists of an inheritance tax so calculated.  A different problem is presented, however, when the state levies an inheritance tax which is a lesser amount than the federal credit for state death taxes and then seeks to \u201cpick up\u201d all or a portion of the credit differential when multistate property is involved. The different problem arises because the credit differential is measured by the <em>total of </em>multistate properties, and <em>Frick </em>teaches us that a state making a claim thereto is limited by that portion attributable to property within that state. The pick-up tax must, accordingly be apportioned.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The critical question is how that apportionment is to be made. The executor urges that we must look to the <em>Treichler </em>opinions for an answer and, not without some confusion, we next proceed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>In <em>net effect </em>the computation of the pick-up tax as approved by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Treichler II </em>started with the federal credit for state death taxes and deducted therefrom that portion of the credit which, because it was attributable to out-of-state property, was unavailable to Wisconsin. The balance of the credit was deemed to be within the jurisdictional reach of Wisconsin. The pick-up tax, accordingly, was calculated to be the difference, if any, between the available credit and the inheritance tax.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">We note from our readings of the <em>Treichler </em>opinions that the allowable pick-up tax which may be levied by one state in a situation where there is multistate property in a decedent\u2019s estate, is not dependent upon the death taxes levied by another state exercising jurisdiction over any of the property involved. Each state according to the <em>Treichler </em>formula may properly levy a pick-up tax which is calculated by first apportioning the federal state death tax credit according to the ratio of property which lies within its borders, and then reducing that apportioned credit by its inheritance tax. The balance of the apportioned credit constitutes the pick-up tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">If we apply the <em>Treichler </em>formula to the situation at hand, California may levy a pick-up tax which is equal to the federal credit for state death taxes ($3,407,198.33) apportioned to the ratio of property in California (.453131), or $1,543,907.19, less its inheritance tax ($1,509,279.32), or $34,627.87. This is the precise amount of pick-up tax fixed by the trial court. The California regulation, however, produces a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>larger tax. The computation of that tax, when compared to the computation under the <em>Treichler </em>formula, is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-5\">Regulation Treichler</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ahp\">Federal credit for state death taxes $ 3,407,198.33 $3,407,198.33</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ab0\">Less Inheritance Taxes</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AUL\">California $1,509,279.32</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A8G\">Texas 797,826.84</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aur\">2.307.106.16</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Axa\">Total credit differential available for pick up per regulation 1.100.092.17</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AaD\">Portion of estate located in California .453131 .453131</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AAzr\">California share of credit differential (pickup tax) per regulation 498,485.87</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AJs\">Total federal credit apportioned to California per <em>Treichler </em>formula 1,543,907.19</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AM-\">Less California inheritance tax 1,509,279.32</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ajt\">California pick-up tax per <em>Treichler </em>formula $ 34,627.87</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b461-18\">Although the computation under the regulation produces a different and larger pick-up tax than under the <em>Treichler </em>formula, it does not necessarily follow that the regulation results in a constitutionally impermissible tax. <em>Treichler II </em>holds only that the Wisconsin apportionment does not offend constitutional limitations. But there is no holding that the formula establishes the outer limits of permissible taxation. A different apportionment, even though it may exact a heavier tax in a given situation, would also be constitutionally permissible if in so apportioning the taxing state confines its jurisdictional reach within its own borders. The Controller contends that the California regulation provides for such an apportionment.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>If we recognize, as we have, that there are components of the federal credit for state death taxes which California cannot pick up, the problem becomes one of separating out those components with reasonable certainty. It is not enough that the separated components be significant in degree or quantity. It is essential, however; that the quality of the separation or apportionment be such that it results in a rational measure of California\u2019s entitlement to claim a portion of the federal credit. Moreover, California\u2019s entitlement should depend on factors pertinent to property or apportioned property within California\u2019s jurisdictional control. Its entitlement should not depend on how one or more of the other states with a right to levy inheritance or pick-up taxes proceed to do so. Should, for instance, a sister state with some portion of estate property located within its borders elect not to assert its claim for a share of the federal credit, California\u2019s entitlement should not thereby be enlarged or otherwise affected as any increased apportionment in California\u2019s favor would extend its jurisdictional reach to the sister state\u2019s property. With these concepts in mind we proceed to examine the .computation under the California regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">We note at the outset that while under the <em>Treichler </em>formula the federal credit is immediately apportioned, under the regulation the federal credit is reduced by the inheritance taxes involved before it is apportioned. The resulting \u201ctotal credit differential\u201d does not, however, necessarily represent the total credit available as pick-up taxes. This follows from the fact that states have an almost unlimited right to fix the amount of the inheritance tax at nothing or at an amount which may exceed the federal credit. If Texas, for instance, fixed its inheritance tax at an amount greater than the total federal credit then, under the regulation, California would be entitled to no pick-up tax although some significant portion of the federal credit (which portion may exceed the California inheritance tax) was attributable to California property. Under the <em>Treichler </em>formula the amount of the Texas inheritance tax does not affect California\u2019s right to pick up its share of the credit differential. Conversely, if Texas assessed no inheritance tax although estate property was located therein, under the regulation the \u201ctotal credit differential available for pick up\u201d would include credits attributable to estate property located in Texas. California would nevertheless pick up such credits under the computations pursuant to the regulation, and thus impermissibly extend its jurisdictional reach into Texas. Under the <em>Treichler </em>formula the failure of Texas to levy an inheritance tax on estate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>property located in Texas would not affect California\u2019s right to pick up its share of the credit differential.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">Although we have dealt only with the extreme situations, it is manifest that there are intermediate impermissible taxing situations under the regulation.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> It is also apparent that the regulation, while purporting to apportion, does not do so in a manner which truly reflects California\u2019s entitlement in every situation. The regulation, in fact, imposes a computation which in one important respect was found wanting in <em>Treichler I. </em>Wisconsin had first subtracted from the federal credit the states\u2019 inheritance taxes to arrive <em>at a </em>balance which it used to calculate its pick-up and emergency taxes. In commenting on this, the United States Supreme Court noted that such procedure had \u201cno necessary relation to\u201d a proper apportionment of the estate property. <em>(Treichler v. Wisconsin, supra, </em>338 U.S. 251, 255 [94 L.Ed. 37, 42].) The California regulation provides for an identical computation in determining the credit differential available for pick up. The reason for the disapproved apportionment in <em>Treichler I </em>is thus equally applicable in the instant case, as the regulation is not necessarily related on a jurisdictional ground to California\u2019s entitlement to pick up its fair share of the federal credit for state death taxes. The regulation, accordingly, must fail on federal constitutional grounds.  It does not follow that the California statutes (Rev. &amp; Tax. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 13441, 13442) infringe constitutional prohibitions. The statutory language, unlike the direction contained in the regulation, does not require an interpretation which extends the Controller\u2019s reach beyond jurisdictional limits and must be construed to withstand constitutional challenge. The \u201cmaximum state tax credit\u201d and \u201cmaximum credit\u201d referred to in sections 13441 and 13442 are accord- - ingly deemed to mean that portion of the federal credit for state death taxes which is attributable to California property as determined under the <em>Treichler </em>formula.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">We have carefully examined the basis upon which the trial court fixed the pick-up tax in the instant case. We are in accord with its analysis of the controlling decisions and conclude that it properly fixed that tax in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>the amount of $34,627.87, and the total death tax in the amount of $1,509,279.32.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">Tobriner, Acting C.

States in the first category, after subtracting from the amount allowable by Internal Revenue Code section 2011 as the state death tax credit all or a portion of the inheritance taxes of all other states, absorb the entire credit differential without apportioning it with those other states which exercise jurisdiction over some portion of the decedent\u2019s assets. A second category of states determine the percentage of decedent\u2019s overall estate lying within the resident state\u2019s taxable jurisdiction and then simply assess a \u201cgross\u201d tax equivalent to such percentage of the total of the credit for state death taxes, without reference to the amount of inheritance taxes assessed by other states. The third category, including California, follow a procedure which requires first subtracting from the scheduled maximum state death tax credit the inheritance taxes of all states wherein some portion of decedent\u2019s property is located, and then apportioning such credit differential according to the percentage of property owned by decedent in each state.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b454-7\">At the time of her death a vast majority of decedent\u2019s Texas assets consisted of working and nonworking interests in mineral deposits of an undisclosed nature.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b454-8\">In addition to the due process contention now raised on appeal, the executor made in the trial court three nonconstitutional objections to the referee\u2019s report, none of which has survived for consideration on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b455-8\">In the third case, <em>Maxwell </em>v. <em>Bugbee </em>(1919) 250 U.S. 525 [63 L.Ed. 1124, 40 S.Ct. 2], the court upheld a New Jersey death tax which took into account the full value of a decedent\u2019s multistate assets as the basis for fixing the <em>rates </em>for calculating New Jersey death taxes levied on property within the borders of that state. Rejecting the contestant\u2019s claim that this method of computing the tax resulted in a deprivation of property without due process of law \u201cbecause it in effect taxes property beyond the jurisdiction of the State\u201d <em>(id, </em>at p. 539 [63 L.Ed. at p. 1131]), the court bestowed its blessing on a rule which permitted states to set death tax rates reflective of a decedent\u2019s total estate, wherever situated and irrespective of actual jurisdiction to tax. There is no challenge in the instant case to California\u2019s rate of taxation. What is challenged is California\u2019s right to apply its rate to property outside its borders.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b457-7\">As presented to us, we are concerned with only the jurisdictional basis for measuring the California pick-up tax, that is, the value of the property over which California may properly assert jurisdiction. No issue is raised as to the <em>rate </em>of taxation, that is, the portion of that taxable basis which may be assessed as a tax. The foregoing quotations from <em>Treichler </em>suggest that the Wisconsin tax failed on constitutional grounds because it was both \u201crated and measured\u201d on property not within Wisconsin\u2019s borders. Although such language may cast some doubt on the continuing validity of <em>Maxwell </em>v. <em>Bugbee, supra, </em>250 U.S. 525 (see fn. 19, <em>ante), </em>we note that <em>Frick, </em>on which <em>Treichler </em>purports to rely, expressly reaffirms the <em>Maxwell </em>rule. There was, further, no rating problem presented in <em>Treichler. </em>Insofar as appears Wisconsin did not attempt to \u201crate\u201d either its inheritance or pick-up tax on property outside its borders although, as appears in our analysis of the United States Supreme Court decision, it \u201cmeasured\u201d its pick-up tax on outside property. There likewise was no rating problem in its emergency tax as the statute provides for a flat 30 percent surtax independently of the gross multistate value of the decedent\u2019s estate.

I can see no persuasive reason for California to assume such magnanimous self-denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">I need not repeat the facts, the regulations, or the respective claims of the litigants, since they are adequately related in the text of the majority opinion. I pause merely at the outset to observe that California\u2019s procedure for multistate division of the credit differential is entirely consistent with the version recommended to states and approved by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws and the American Bar Association House of Delegates. (Cf. 2 Casner, Estate Planning (3d ed., 1976 supp. to vol. 2) p. 1892.) If adopted by all states, California\u2019s apportionment regulation would guard against imposition of combined pick-up and death taxes in excess of the maximum federal credit, for deduction of each state\u2019s death taxes from the credit differential, by definition, enables absorption of only a residual credit differential; and. percentage apportionment of the residual then prevents decedent\u2019s' total tax bill from exceeding the original federal credit. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>Unfortunately some other states exhibit a pecuniary aggressiveness that causes them to misconstrue the concept of pick-up taxes and, instead of apportioning the credit differential by reference to their respective proportions of federal taxable property or available credit differential, appropriate the entire credit differential without regard to either competing claims of sister states or the independent right of other states to impose their death taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">While decedent indisputably resided in California at the time of her death and assets comprising her sizeable estate were almost equally divided between Texas and California, the executor has demonstrated a clear preference for Texas by electing to pay the entire sum of $1,863,291.14 in death and pick-up taxes requested by Texas authorities ($797,826.84 in Texas death taxes plus $1,065,464.30 in additional pick-up taxes) but refusing to remit more than $1,509,279.32 of the $2,007,775.19 in total taxes due California, as claimed by the Controller (all of this state\u2019s death taxes but none of the $498,485.87 in pick-up taxes). If the executor had followed the referee\u2019s calculation under the regulation, California could have realized its full share of tax revenue while leaving unaffected whatever assessment Texas chose to make against the estate:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-6\">\n<img class=\"blockquote\" height=\"41\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,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\" width=\"1396\"/>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AJO\">Texas death taxes 797,826.84</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aph\">Total $2,307,106.16</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-10\">Total federal credit $3,407,198.33</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqk\">Less: total death taxes 2,307,106.16</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AJv\">Available credit differential $1,100,092.17</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-14\">Percent of estate located in Calif. 45.3131</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aou\">California share of credit differential $ 498,485.87</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b465-16\">Instead, the executor disregarded the above method of calculation and now contends that its California tax liability should amount to no more than the reciprocal share of the federal credit remaining after payment of total taxes charged by Texas authorities ($1,863,291.14) without reference to deduction of either state\u2019s death taxes. Thus the executor asks us to embrace the Texas scheme of tax computation and to ignore that adopted by our taxing authority. It is not out of chauvinism that I conclude the California method is equally rational and clearly permissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>The majority correctly note that there are only three Supreme Court decisions addressing the constitutionality of death or pick-up taxes. In each case in which the court found a constitutional violation, it condemned state law for attempting to impose either a direct or an indirect tax on out-of-state property, thereby denying foreign states the right to collect revenue attributable to property lying within their jurisdictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">California\u2019s regulation, by contrast, specifically eschews any interference with Texas\u2019 right to assess and collect the maximum amount of death and pick-up taxes allowed under Texas and federal law and thus carefully avoids the legal pitfalls of an attempted tax on either out-of-state property or revenue attributable thereto. Accordingly, the leitmotif of the three high court decisions that sketch permissible constitutional boundaries for death and pick-up taxation furnishes persuasive support for sustaining the California regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">The first opinion was <em>Maxwell </em>v. <em>Bugbee </em>(1919) 250 U.S. 525 [63 L.Ed. 1124, 40 S.Ct. 2], in which the court upheld a New Jersey death tax that took into account the full value of a nonresident decedent\u2019s multistate assets for determining New Jersey death tax rates. Rejecting the contention that this method of computing the tax resulted in a deprivation of property without due process of law \u201cbecause it in eifect taxes property beyond the jurisdiction of the State\u201d <em>(id., </em>at p. 539 [63 L.Ed. at p. 1131]), <em>Bugbee </em>approved a rule that permits states to set death tax rates reflective of decedent\u2019s total estate, wherever situated and irrespective of actual jurisdiction to tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">Six years later, in <em>Frick </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania </em>(1925) 268 U.S. 473 [69 L.Ed. 1058, 45 S.Ct. 603, 42 A.L.R. 316], the high court invalidated the portion of Pennsylvania\u2019s death tax law that sought to impose exactions directly on tangible property, the largest part of which consisted of a New York art collection. The court held that \u201cwhile a State may so shape its tax laws to reach every object which is under its jurisdiction it cannot give them any extraterritorial operation.\u201d <em>(Id, </em>at p. 489 [69 L.Ed. at p. 1062].) <em>Frick </em>thus emphasizes that a <em>direct </em>tax on out-of-state personal and real property constitutes a reach of constitutionally impermissible dimension.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">California\u2019s regulation, when evaluated in light of <em>Frick, </em>must be viewed as steering a course entirely clear of extraterritorial overreaching. Neither on its face nor as applied by the Controller does the regulation purport to exact taxes from property in Texas. On the contrary, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>regulation\u2019s pick-up authority is expressly limited to \u201can amount which bears the same <em>ratio </em>to the difference between the total of taxes imposed by all of the states and the maximum state tax credit as the net value of <em>property subject to the Inheritance Tax Laws of this State </em>bears to the net value of property subject to the inheritance tax laws of all the states.\u201d (Italics added.) (Cal. Admin. Code, tit. 18, \u00a7\u00a7 13441-13442.) By taxing no more of the credit differential than can be linked directly to decedent\u2019s California estate assets, our regulation transcends the narrow objective of simply avoiding extraterritorial taxation condemned by <em>Frick </em>and serves as an inherent guard against infringement of death or pick-up taxes assessed by Texas.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">The executor here relies almost exclusively on the third high court case: <em>Treichler </em>v. <em>Wisconsin </em>(1949) 338 U.S. 251 [94 L.Ed. 37, 70 S.Ct. 1]. He argues that our regulation manifests the same constitutional vice as Wisconsin\u2019s emergency tax, namely, an alleged <em>indirect </em>tax on tangible property located out of state. In reality, however, calculation of California\u2019s pick-up and Wisconsin\u2019s emergency taxes differ in three critical aspects. And while only one such difference formed the basis for invalidation of Wisconsin\u2019s levy in <em>Treichler, </em>all three illustrate ways in which our regulation assures a fairer, more meticulously apportioned determination of pick-up tax than does Wisconsin\u2019s emergency formula.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">California\u2019s regulation restricts this state\u2019s share of the credit differential to the apportioned 45.3131 percent of decedent\u2019s estate represented by California assets; we also subtract out all other states\u2019 death taxes. In marked contrast, the Wisconsin emergency tax involves a failing of this precise restriction. In <em>Treichler </em>decedent\u2019s estate consisted of 87.52 percent assets subject to Wisconsin taxing authority and 12.48 percent taxable in Florida and Illinois. Oblivious to the need for apportionment, however, the emergency tax allowed Wisconsin to pick up 100 percent of the federal credit remaining after deduction of Florida and Illinois death taxes\u2014thus including a credit differential properly belonging to Florida and Illinois\u2014and thereby forcing an <em>indirect tax </em>on foreign state property. Affirming the <em>Frick </em>rule that states may neither directly nor indirectly tax tangible out-of-state property, <em>Treichler </em>likened <em>Frick\u2019s </em>illicit death tax to Wisconsin\u2019s emergency tax: \u201cWisconsin\u2019s statute may be more sophisticated than Pennsylvania\u2019s, but in terms of ultimate consequences this case and the <em>Frick </em>case are one. It is quite unnecessary to know in either case what property is located within the taxing jurisdiction in order to compute the challenged exaction.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 256 [94 L.Ed. at p. 42].)</p>\n<p id=\"b468-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>California\u2019s regulation departs markedly from the nonapportioning, pecuniarily acquisitive approach exemplified by the condemned Wisconsin emergency tax. The very essence of our regulation is a strict limitation on pick-up taxation according to the exact percentage of decedent\u2019s property located within this state\u2019s taxing jurisdiction and a complete deference to both death and pick-up taxes claimed by other jurisdictions. Therefore, unlike <em>Frick </em>and <em>Treichler, </em>our regulation asserts no direct or indirect claim to death taxes assessed by Texas and leaves totally untouched Texas\u2019 54.6869 percent share of federal credit subject to that state\u2019s pick-up authority. Unlike Wisconsin\u2019s emergency tax, moreover, our pick-up regulation deducts the full impact of California death taxes prior to calculation; we thus ensure that our own death taxes will be assessed only once. Finally, while Wisconsin\u2019s emergency tax required that a flat 30 percent rate be employed, once again heedless to the proportion of estate property subject to tax by that state, our regulation contains no fixed percentages that disregard out-of-state property.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">In the years since <em>Treichler </em>the high court has not issued a single decision dealing with the constitutionality of death or pick-up taxes challenged for their jurisdictional reach. Several opinions addressing the constitutional imposition of state use and gross receipts taxes, however, provide a clear indication that contemporary judicial tolerance for the jurisdictional reach of state taxation is considerably broader than in 1949 when <em>Treichler </em>was decided. (See, e.g., <em>Complete Auto Transit, Inc. </em>v. <em>Brady </em>(1977)430 U.S. 274 [51 L.Ed.2d 326,97 S.Ct. 1076]; <em>Scripto v. Carson </em>(1960) 362 U.S. 207 [4 L.Ed.2d 54, 80 S.Ct. 52]; <em>Standard Steel Co. </em>v. <em>Wash. Revenue Dept. </em>(1975) 419 U.S. 560 [42 L.Ed.2d 719, 95 S.Ct. 706]; for the California approach, see <em>Sea-Land Service, Inc. </em>v. <em>County of Alameda </em>(1974) 12 Cal.3d 772, 781-788 [117 Cal.Rptr. 448, 528 P.2d 56].) This unmistakable trend of tolerance for state taxation serves to emphasize the weak foundation upon which <em>Treichler </em>rests.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">As I have indicated above, the instant matter is readily distinguishable from <em>Treichler, </em>but even if not, that case may not be read to und\u00e9rmine in any way the California regulation\u2019s constitutional reach. Even if the majority\u2019s interpretation of <em>Treichler </em>were convincing, there is sufficient doubt of <em>Treichler\u2019s </em>continued vitality to render its precedential value very slight. Certainly it should not control our determination of the validity of a regulation of this state that has survived more than three decades.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>Basically the executor complains of California\u2019s comparatively larger total tax bill notwithstanding Texas jurisdiction over a greater proportion of decedent\u2019s total estate. He overlooks the underlying reason: Texas residents enjoy a death tax rate considerably lower than the prevailing California rate. (Compare Rev. &amp; Tax. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 13404-13406 with Tex. Tax-Gen. Ann., arts. 14.02-14.06, and art. 14.12, subd. (D) (Vernon).) Due to the sizeable variation in death tax rates, California\u2019s smaller share of the credit differential ($498,485.87 versus $1,065,464.30 for Texas), while reflecting a perfectly apportioned share of estate assets wholly within this state\u2019s jurisdiction, nevertheless fails to offset the larger combined death and pick-up tax burden assessed by California ($2,007,775.19 versus $1,863,291.14 for Texas).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">Ignoring the independent legitimacy of California entitlement to assess death and other taxes on in-state property at whatever nonconfiscatory rate is desired (see, e.g., <em>Estate of Good </em>(1963) 213 Cal.App.2d 45, 48-50 [28 Cal.Rptr. 378]; <em>Pittsburgh </em>v. <em>Alco Parking Corp. </em>(1974) 417 U.S. 369, 373-378 [41 L.Ed.2d 132, 136-139, 94 S.Ct. 2291]), the executor lumps together death and pick-up taxes for purposes of interstate comparison, discovers that total taxes in California ($2,007,765.19) slightly surpass the total in Texas ($1,863,291.14), and concludes that section 2011 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 constitutionally prevents California from levying taxes of more than 45.3131 percent of the entire federal credit. The conclusion is entirely unfounded, for the federal government under section 2011 in no way attempts to influence the rate or application of California death taxes. Death taxes remain purely within the discretion of individual states, and the federal credit statute does no more than encourage states to pick up the maximum amount of federal estate tax dollars returnable under its aegis to the state treasury.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">The executor next contends that since California\u2019s aggregate death and pick-up tax obligation exceeds 45.3131 percent of the federal credit, the regulation operates discriminatorily and actually imposes an unconstitutional tax on part of the estate\u2019s Texas assets. Whatever inequality occurs in the system, however, derives from factors extraneous to the operation of the California regulation and owes its existence to accepted legal rules. In accounting for larger aggregate death and pick-up taxes in this state than in Texas, once again the simple explanation is that California imposes death taxes on assets within its jurisdiction at higher rates than Texas. Case law clearly provides that states have an independent right to a proportionate share of the credit differential irrespective of whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>double or triple payments are thereby mandated. Thus <em>Estate of Good, supra, </em>213 Cal.App.2d 45 and <em>Estate of Amar </em>(1967) 255 Cal.App.2d 404 [63 Cal.Rptr. 444], properly spumed due process and equal protection challenges to the pick-up tax and held that estate taxpayers must pay California its full share of the credit differential regardless of whether another taxing entity, such as the federal government, collects the same credit differential, refuses to refund any part of that credit differential to this state or the executor, and thereby forces double or multiple taxation in excess of the calculated credit differential. The United States Treasury, moreover, has accepted the principles of <em>Good </em>and <em>Amar. </em>(See Rev. Rul. 70-272, 1970-1 Cum. Bull. 187.) That ruling provides that taxation of the same asset by two different states, even if deemed double taxation, qualifies under the federal credit and will be honored by the federal government.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">California is therefore empowered, without necessary reliance on any of the regulation\u2019s allegedly discriminatory features, to pick up its proportionate 45.3131 percent share of the credit differential and, further, to collect death taxes on estate assets within this state\u2019s jurisdiction at higher rates than Texas imposes on property subject to its jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">The executor\u2019s characterization of the regulation as discriminatory, therefore, disregards this state\u2019s recognized, autonomous rights and misdirects responsibility for multistate discrepancies.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Ascribing blame for such discrepancies to incomplete federal credit provisions that fail to apportion at the federal level, the Florida Supreme Court observed: \u201c[T]he defect is in the federal law which does not require the proper allotment of the credit as between the states having taxable interest in the property belonging to the estate of a particular decedent.\u201d <em>(Green </em>v. <em>State </em>(Fla. 1964) 166 So.2d 585, 590.) In my opinion the regulation operates free <em>of </em>discriminatory shortcomings and in furtherance of the state\u2019s revenue-generating interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">Lastly and as somewhat of an afterthought, the executor maintains that the regulation constitutes an improper delegation of administrative authority. Statutory delegation of authority in the present case confers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>upon the Controller a broad grant of power to <em>issue, administer, and enforce </em>death and pick-up tax regulations. Specifically, Revenue and Taxation Code section 14740 provides that \u201cThe Controller may make and enforce rules and regulations relating to the administration and enforcement of [death and pick-up taxes], and may prescribe the extent, if any, to which any ruling or regulation shall be applied without retroactive effect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">The Controller responds that the regulation furthers equitable administration and enforcement of the pick-up tax in two distinct ways: (1) it respects other states\u2019 death taxes by subtracting out their full amounts <em>before </em>seeking to retain any portion of the federal credit, and (2) it promotes equality by apportioning the credit differential according to the percentage of decedent\u2019s property subject to each state\u2019s jurisdiction. Thus, years prior to <em>Treichler </em>and the uniform act, the Controller perceptively anticipated the future direction in the death tax field and structured California\u2019s system accordingly. The Controller could and did reasonably conclude, as early as 1945, that the Legislature\u2019s unambiguous grant of administration, enforcement, and prescription power over pick-up tax rules and regulations justifiably warranted adoption of the regulation to promote its objectives of deference and equitable apportionment. The regulation, therefore, should be sustained as a reasonable delegation of authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">Finally, we must ascertain whether the regulation is \u201creasonably necessary.\u201d In so doing this court should defer to the agency\u2019s expertise and refuse to \u201csuperimpose its own policy judgment upon the agency in the absence of an arbitrary and capricious decision.\u201d <em>(Pitts </em>v. <em>Perluss </em>(1962) 58 Cal.2d 824, 832 [27 Cal.Rptr. 19, 377 P.2d 83]; accord, <em>Morris </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1967) 67 Cal.2d 733, 749 [63 Cal.Rptr. 689, 433 P.2d 697]; <em>Agricultural Labor Relations Board </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1976) 16 Cal.3d 392, 441 [128 Cal.Rptr. 183, 546 P.2d 687], app. dism. (1976) 429 U.S. 802 [50 L.Ed.2d 63, 97 S.Ct. 33, 34].) Nor, in passing judgment on the Controller\u2019s decision to adopt the particular regulation under challenge, may we consider the possible sagacity or superiority of alternatives: \u201c[T]his court does not inquire whether, if it had power to draft the regulation, it would have adopted some method or formula other than that promulgated by the [agency]. The court does not substitute its judgment for that of the administrative body.\u201d <em>(Pitts </em>v. <em>Perluss, supra, </em>58 Cal.2d 824, 834-835.) Thus we must not venture to speculate, for example, on the economic advisability or purported advantages of an apportionment formula that calculates this state\u2019s share of the federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>credit on a gross rather than net basis. To undertake the task of second-guessing the Controller would exceed the bounds of judicial propriety, frustrate the legislative policy of reliance upon the special competence of an administrative agency, and transgress our narrow function of determining only whether the Controller employs a reasonable, nonarbitrary method to further the administrative purpose. (See <em>Ralph\u2019s Grocery Co. </em>v. <em>Reimel </em>(1968) 69 Cal.2d 172, 180 [70 Cal.Rptr. 407, 444 P.2d 79].)</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">^ In sum I cannot agree that the Controller\u2019s decision to use a regulation that encourages equitable apportionment and total noninterference with sister state death tax exactions is arbitrary or capricious in violation of what constitutes \u201creasonable necessity.\u201d If anything the regulation makes an uncommon attempt to achieve both deference and equity in an arena often identified as rife with tax-gathering aggressiveness and chauvinism. It deserves to be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">I would reverse the trial court\u2019s order and reinstate the tax referee\u2019s determination requiring the executor to pay the Controller $498,485.87 in delinquent taxes.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b470-7\">As stated in the context of death taxation by the high court in <em>Bugbee, </em>\u201cinequalities that result not from hostile discrimination, but occasionally and incidentally in the application of a system that is not arbitrary in its classification, are not sufficient to defeat the law.\u201d <em>(Maxwell </em>v. <em>Bugbee, supra, </em>250 U.S. 525, 543 [63 L.Ed. 1124, 1133]; accord, <em>Estate of Good, supra, </em>213 Cal.App.2d 45, 52; see also <em>Sea-Land Service, Inc. </em>v. <em>County of Alameda, supra, </em>12 Cal.3d 772, 780.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
