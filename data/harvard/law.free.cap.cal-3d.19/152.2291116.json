After such study, we have concluded that the opinion prepared by Justice Cole (assigned) for the Court of Appeal correctly treats and disposes of the issues involved, and we adopt it as and for the opinion of this court. Such opinion (with appropriate deletions and additions as indicated) is as follows:<footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b187-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>The sole issue presented by these appeals is whether section 27428 of the Public Resources Code, a part of the California Coastal Zone Conservation Act of 1972,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> authorizes the award of attorneys\u2019 fees to successful defendants and cross-defendants, as well as to successful plaintiffs and cross-complainants. We have concluded that it does, and that the orders appealed from herein consequently must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">Appellant here, Great Lakes Properties, Inc., was named as a defendant in an action brought against it and others by the Portuguese Bend Defense Committee. Great Lakes filed a cross-complaint against numerous public and private entities, including respondents herein. The complaint, with which we are not otherwise involved, sought injunctive relief under the Act (\u00a7 27425). The cross-complaint asked for similar relief, and as well for an award of civil penalties (\u00a7\u00a7 27500, 27501) in an amount pleaded to be in excess of $705 million. Respondents\u2019 demurrers to the cross-complaint were sustained without leave to amend and the action was dismissed as to each respondent. Thereafter, each respondent moved the court to award attorneys\u2019 fees, pursuant to section 27428. The <em>amount </em>of the fees sought, as opposed to the power of the court to award them, was stipulated to be reasonable. The court entered separate orders awarding fees to respondent C &amp; M Development Company and to respondent cities, and these appeals followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">Section 27428 provides: \u201cAny person who prevails in a civil action brought to enjoin a violation of this division [the Act] or to recover civil penalties shall be awarded his costs, including reasonable attorneys fees.\u201d The Act itself defines \u201cperson\u201d in section 27105: \u201c \u2018Person\u2019 includes any individual, organization, partnership, and corporation, including any utility and any agency of federal, state, and local government.\u201d Appellant argues that the word \u201cperson\u201d as used in section 27428 refers only to plaintiffs. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">It is axiomatic that in the interpretation of a statute where the language is clear, its plain meaning should be followed. (45 Cal.Jur.2d, Statutes, \u00a7 108, p. 621.)</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">\u201c \u2018One who contends that a provision of an act must not be applied according to the natural or customary purport of its language must show either that some other section of the act expands or restricts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>its meaning, that the provision itself is repugnant to the general purview of the act, or that the act considered in pari materia with other acts, or with the legislative history of the subject matter, imports a different meaning.\u2019 (2A Sands, Statutes and Statutory Construction (4th ed. of Sutherland, Statutory Construction, 1973) \u00a7 46.01, p. 49.)\u201d <em>{Leroy T. </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1974) 12 Cal.3d 434, at p. 438 [115 Cal.Rptr. 761, 525 P.2d 665].)</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">In support of its argument that \u201cperson,\u201d as used in section 27428, does not include defendants, appellant claims that the Act uses the word \u201cperson\u201d in varying ways depending upon the sections involved. Appellant seizes upon seven sections, two of which we refer to for purposes of illustration. Thus, appellant argues that section 27400 (\u201c. . . any person wishing to perform any development within the permit area shall obtain a permit . . .\u201d) limits persons to those who wish to proceed with a development within the permit area and who must obtain a permit; appellant also states that section 27425 (\u201cAny person may maintain an action for declaratory and equitable relief to restrain violation of this division. . .\u201d) is limited to those who seek to enjoin the developer from proceeding with a development in violation of the Act. The argument is specious. Those sections and the others referred to by appellant in no way <em>limit </em>the broad definition of the word \u201cperson\u201d (found in \u00a7 27105, <em>supra). </em>Rather, they apply that broad definition to the specific situations referred to in the sections in question: \u201cPerson\u201d retains the same meaning throughout the Act. We deem the fact the Act itself defines \u201cpersdn\u201d to be of importance.  \u201cWhen a statute prescribes the meaning to be given to particular terms used by it, that meaning is generally binding on the courts.\u201d <em>{People </em>v. <em>Western Air Lines, Inc. </em>(1954) 42 Cal.2d 621, 638 [268 P.2d 723].)</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">In <em>Kalico, Inc. </em>v. <em>Dooley </em>(1961) 198 Cal.App.2d 379 [17 Cal.Rptr. 799], a contention identical to that made here was rejected. There a statute provided that the court \u201c. . . shall award to the prevailing party a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee . . . .\u201d The argument was that \u201cprevailing party\u201d really meant prevailing claimant and not prevailing defendant. The court held that the language of the section was clear and included defendants as well as plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">Appellant purports to find a compelling reason to depart from the clear language of the statute by pointing to the purposes of the Act. It is true that an important consideration in the interpretation of a statute is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>the objective or purpose of that statute (e.g., <em>People </em>ex rel. <em>S. F. Bay etc. Com. </em>v. <em>Town of Emeryville </em>(1968) 69 Cal.2d 533, 543, 544 [72 Cal.Rptr. 790, 446 P.2d 790]). In enacting the Act by the initiative process the people set forth a finding (\u00a7 27001) that it is necessary to preserve the natural resources of the California coastline.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">Appellant points out that the Act provides that individuals may seek to enforce its provisions by suing for injunctive relief without posting a bond (\u00a7 27425) and by suing for civil penalties (\u00a7 27426). It argues that to interpret section 27428 as allowing attorneys\u2019 fees to successful defendants would frustrate the purpose of encouraging private plaintiffs to enforce the Act. The argument is not persuasive. In appellant\u2019s own words, the Act \u201c. . . assures those persons who may wish to compel compliance with [it] that they will not be burdened with the substantial financial cost of having to utilize their personal financial resources to finance a lawsuit if they prevail.\u201d (Italics added.) But it is inherent in the scheme of things that if private persons suing under the Act do <em>not </em>prevail, they will inevitably be financially burdened by their own attorneys\u2019 fees and by the investment of their time and efforts in prosecuting the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">It is purely speculative to urge that the added burden of having to pay an attorneys\u2019 fee will deter efforts to enforce the Act.  This is particularly true in light of the clear and mandatory nature of the-language. Section 27428 says that any person who prevails \u201cshall\u201d be awarded his costs and \u201cshall\u201d is used in a mandatory sense (\u00a7 15). The fact that the Act expresses a policy to encourage the protection of the coastline cannot detract from this' clear language.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">There are many statutes which allow the recovery of attorneys\u2019 fees to successful plaintiffs under varying circumstances and they are phrased in varying ways.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Each of the statutes referred to in footnote 2 allows the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>recovery of attorneys\u2019 fees to variously described persons under certain circumstances, and each expresses the policy of the State of California in the field in which the statute operates. The Act also expresses the policy of the state, but it clearly shows that in enacting the statute the People did not feel that policy would be thwarted if the victor, be he defendant or plaintifi\", is allowed to recover attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">Allowing for attorneys\u2019 fees to be paid to any person who prevails in a civil action brought under the Act also serves the purpose of preventing frivolous litigation. No policy embodied in the Act encourages such lawsuits.[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>]</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">The orders appealed from are affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b186-10\">Before Tobriner, Acting C.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AmX\">I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">In construing section 27428 as requiring \u201cprivate attorney general\u201d plaintiffs to pay attorneys fees incurred by successful defendants, the majority ignore the cardinal principle of statutory interpretation, which mandates that statutes be construed to effectuate the legislative purpose underlying the enactment. Although the language of section 27428, read in isolation, is susceptible to the majority\u2019s interpretation, it is equally susceptible to the interpretation that attorneys fees are to be awarded only to persons who have brought actions to enforce the act. The statute is not unambiguous. When the ambiguous statutory language is construed in conjunction with the accompanying statutory provisions and with a view to the section\u2019s manifest purpose of encouraging private attorney general enforcement actions, it becomes clear that the section should be interpreted as authorizing an attorneys fee award only to persons who successfully prosecute enforcement actions under the 1972 coastal act. In reaching the contrary conclusion, the majority fail to heed Justice Frankfurter\u2019s wise admonition that \u201c[statutes ... are not inert <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>exercises in literary composition. They are instruments of government, and in construing them \u2018the general purpose is a more important aid to the meaning than any which grammar or formal logic may lay down.\u2019 \u201d <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Shirey </em>(1959) 359 U.S. 255, 260-261 [3 L.Ed.2d 789, 793-794, 79 S.Ct. 746].)</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">Analysis of the statutory interpretation issue before us should properly begin, I believe, by placing section 27428 in its proper legislative setting. Section 27428 was adopted as part of the 1972 Coastal Zone Conservation Act initiative, an initiative measure sponsored by a coalition of environmentalist organizations after the state Legislature had repeatedly failed to adopt. proposed bills that would have provided for the preparation of a long-range plan to govern development and conservation of California\u2019s precious coastal 'region. (See generally Adams, <em>Proposition 20\u2014A Citizens' Campaign </em>(1973) 24 Syracuse L.Rev. 1019.)</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">In <em>State of California </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Veta) </em>(1974) 12 Cal.3d 237, 253 [115 Cal.Rptr. 497, 524 P,2d 1281], we briefly summarized the purpose and operation of the 1972 initiative: \u201cThe Act declares that the coastal zone is a valuable resource belonging to all of the people, that its permanent protection is a paramount concern to the citizens of the state, and that in order to protect this valuable resource it is necessary to study the coastal zone, prepare a comprehensive plan for its orderly, long-range conservation and management, and insure that any development which occurs in the permit area during the study and planning period will be consistent with the objectives of the Act. [Citation.] . . . Among the objectives of the coastal zone plan are the avoidance of irreversible and irretrievable commitments of coastal zone resources. [Citation.] In order to assure that the purposes of the Act are not impaired during the period in which the plan is in the process of formulation, those who seek to perform any development within the permit area are, with certain exceptions, required to seek a permit from the Commission.\u201d (See also <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1975) 15 Cal.3d 52, 54 [123 Cal.Rptr. 377, 538 P.2d 1137].)</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">Recognizing that the policing of on-going development and other activities along California\u2019s lengthy coastline to ensure compliance with the act was certain to pose substantial problems for the limited staff of public officials charged with that task, the draftsmen of the coastal initiative, taking their cue from similar provisions contained in earlier <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>federal civil rights and environmental protection legislation,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> included in the initiative a series of provisions (Pub. Resources Code, \u00a7\u00a7 27425-27428) aimed at enlisting the aid of public-minded citizens in the role of \u201cprivate attorney general,\u201d to help in the critically important enforcement effort.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Eliminating traditional \u201cstanding\u201d restrictions, these sections explicitly authorized \u201cany person\u201d to maintain an action to enjoin a violation of the act or to bring suit on behalf of the state to recover civil penalties under the act. <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7\u00a7 27425, 27426.) The sections also specifically suspended the bond requirement normally imposed in injunction actions <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 27425), recognizing the need to remove such an economic barrier if citizens and public interest organizations, who would reap no monetary rewards from such actions, were to be encouraged to play a major role in enforcing the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">Section 27428 was included as one of the provisions in this \u201cprivate attorney general\u201d segment of the act. The principal purpose for its inclusion is, I think, quite clear. At the time the initiative was drafted, experience with the private attorney general concept had demonstrated that when no potential monetary recovery was available to defray the extensive costs of litigation, private citizens were seriously inhibited from instituting \u201cpublic interest\u201d actions if they inevitably were required to bear their own attorneys fees. As the United States Supreme Court observed in <em>Newman </em>v. <em>Piggie Park Enterprises </em>(1968) 390 U.S. 400, 402 [19 L.Ed.2d 1263, 1265-1266, 88 S.Ct. 964]: \u201cIf successful plaintiffs were routinely forced to bear their own attorneys\u2019 fees, few [private attorneys general] would be .in a position to advance the public interest by invoking the injunctive power of the federal courts.\u201d (See generally King &amp; Plater, <em>The Right to Counsel Fees in Public Interest Environmental </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number><em>Litigation </em>(1973) 41 Tenn.L.Rev. 27; Note, <em>Awarding Attorney and Expert Witness Fees in Environmental Litigation </em>(1973) 58 Cornell L.Rev. 1222.)</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">To overcome this problem, section 27428 was drafted to guarantee that any person who successfully prosecuted an action either to enjoin a violation of the act or to recover civil penalties (payable to the state) for violation of the act could recover his attorneys fees from the party who was found to have violated the act. The prior cases and numerous academic commentaries that have discussed the question uniformly agree that section 27428\u2019s main purpose was \u201cto encourage private plaintiffs to enforce the act.\u201d <em>(Sanders </em>v. <em>Pacific Gas and Elec. Co. </em>(1975) 53 Cal.App.3d 661, 673 [126 Cal.Rptr. 415]; see, e.g., <em>Klittgaard &amp; Jones </em>v. <em>San Diego Coast Regional Com. </em>(1975) 48 Cal.App.3d 99, 109 [121 Cal.Rptr. 650]; Miller, <em>Enforcing the Coastal Act\u2014Citizen Suits and Attorney\u2019s Fees </em>(1974) 49 State Bar J. 236, 240-241; Comment, <em>Coastal Controls in California: Wave of the Future? </em>(1974) 11 Harv.J.Legis. 463, 476; Note, <em>Saving the Seashore: Management Planning for the Coastal Zone </em>(1973) 25 Hastings L.J. 191, 201.)</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">The majority do not deny that the principal purpose underlying section 27428 was to facilitate \u201cprivate attorney general\u201d suits, but they reason that in light of the \u201cplain language\u201d of the statute, the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the section accords attorneys fees to prevailing defendants as well as to prevailing plaintiffs is irrefutable. The majority emphasize that section 27428 provides simply that <em>\u201c[a]ny person </em>who prevails in a court action brought to enjoin a violation of this division or to recover civil penalties shall be awarded his costs, including reasonable attorneys fees\u201d (italics added), and that the 1972 coastal act itself contains a broad definition of the term \u201cperson\u201d which does not limit that term to \u201cplaintiffs.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Inasmuch as the respondent corporation and cities are clearly \u201cpersons\u201d under the act\u2019s definitional section, the majority conclude that, read \u201cliterally,\u201d section 27428 unambiguously authorizes the attorneys fee awards rendered in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">This conclusion is flawed in a number of respects. First, I cannot agree that the language of section 27428, even when read in isolation, \u201cunambiguously\u201d supports the trial court\u2019s conclusion. Although the statutory language is susceptible to the trial court\u2019s interpretation, the section\u2019s wording is equally susceptible to the interpretation that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>attorneys fees are to be awarded to \u201cany person who prevails in an action [which he has] brought to enjoin a violation of this division or to recover civil penalties....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">Moreover, our cases have long made clear that a statutory provision cannot be interpreted in a vacuum but must \u201cbe construed with reference to the whole system of law of which it is a part....\u201d <em>(Stafford </em>v. <em>L.A. etc. Retirement Board </em>(1954) 42 Cal.2d 795, 799 [270 P,2d 12].) When read in conjunction with its accompanying statutory provisions, it becomes clear that section 27428\u2019s \u201cplain language\u201d does not indicate a legislative intent to authorize attorneys fees for both plaintiffs and defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">Sections 27425, 27426 and 27428, read in sequence, provide: <em>\u201cAny person </em>may maintain an action for declaratory and equitable relief to restrain violation of this division. No bond shall be required for an action, under this section.\u201d (Italics added.) <em>\u201cAny person </em>may maintain an action for the recovery of civil penalties provided in Sections 27500 and 27501.\u201d (Italics added.) <em>\u201cAny person </em>who prevails in a civil action -brought to enjoin a violation of this division or to recover civil penalties shall be awarded his costs, including reasonable attorneys fe\u00e9s.\u201d (Italics added.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In this context, the \u201cany person\u201d terminology of section 27428 appears clearly to refer to the identical \u201cany person\u201d language of sections 27425 and 27426, i.e., persons who have been granted broad standing rights to institute actions for injunctive relief or for the recovery of. statutory penalties. Thus, viewing these related provisions as a w;hole, I believe that the statutory language of section 27428 supports Great Lakes\u2019 contention that the provision was intended to authorize attorneys fees only to plaintiffs who prevail in actions instituted pursuant to sections 27425 and 27426.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">In this' regard, it is significant that in designating the persons entitled to recover attorneys fees, the draftsmen of section 27428 utilized the \u201cany person\u201d language of sections 27425 and 27426, rather than the phrase \u201cany party\u201d or \u201cprevailing party.\u201d Statutes which contemplate the recovery of attorneys fees by prevailing plaintiffs <em>or </em>defendants commonly utilize the \u201cprevailing party\u201d terminology (see, e.g., Civ. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1811.1, 2984.4), and if the draftsmen had actually intended to authorize the recovery of attorneys fees by both plaintiffs and defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>dants, they would probably have written the statute in such terms. Because section 27428 does not accord attorneys fees to the \u201cprevailing party,\u201d the majority\u2019s reliance on <em>Kalico, Inc. </em>v. <em>Dooley </em>(1961) 198 Cal.App.2d 379 [17 Cal.Rptr. 799]\u2014a case construing a statutory provision which specifically utilized su.ch language\u2014is clearly misplaced.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\">Finally, even if a literal reading of section 27428 supported the trial court\u2019s interpretation, respondents\u2019 suggestion that the legislative purpose of the provision must give way to such literal reading flies in the face of a cardinal principle of statutory construction long recognized by this court. As we have explained on many occasions: \u201cThe fundarfiental rule of statutory construction is that the court should ascertain the intent of the Legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.\u201d <em>{Select Base Materials </em>v. <em>Board of Equal. </em>(1959) 51 Cal.2d 640, 645 [335 P.2d 672]; <em>Cal. Toll Bridge Authority </em>v. <em>Kuchel </em>(1952) 40 Cal.2d 43, 53 [251 P.2d 4]; <em>Dickey </em>v. <em>Raisin Proration Zone No. 1 </em>(1944) 24 Cal.2d 796, 802 [151 P.2d 505, 157 A.L.R. 324].) \u201cOnce a particular legislative intent has been ascertained, it must be given effect \u2018 \u201ceven though it may not be consistent with the strict letter of the statute.\u201d \u2019 [Citations omitted] . . . \u2018 \u201cThe mere literal construction of a section in a statute ought not to prevail if it is opposed to the intention of the legislature apparent by the statute; and if the words are sufficiently flexible to admit of some other construction it is to be adopted to effectuate that intention. The intent prevails over the letter, and the letter will, if possible, be so read as to conform to the spirit of the act.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>{Friends of Mammoth </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors </em>(1972) 8 Cal.3d 247, 259 [104 Cal.Rptr. 761, 502 P.2d 1049].)</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">As already explained, considered in light of the general purposes of the 1972 coastal initiative and the related statutory provisions, it is clear that section 27428 was adopted to encourage and to facilitate private citizen enforcement suits under the act. (See, e.g., <em>Sanders </em>v. <em>Pacific Gas </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number><em>&amp; Elec. Co., supra, </em>53 Cal.App.3d 661, 673; <em>Klittgaard &amp; Jones, Inc. </em>v. <em>San Diego Coast Regional Com., supra, </em>48 Cal.App.3d 99, 109.) As a number of commentators have observed, however, the inevitable consequence of the majority\u2019s interpretation would be to deter, and perhaps \u201ceffectively eliminate,\u201d such private attorney general actions, for private citizens would not only lack any economic incentive to pursue such suits but would face the prospect of a sizeable attorney fee liability\u2014in addition to their own attorneys fee\u2014if they should lose. (See Comment, <em>Coastal Controls in California: Wave of the Future? </em>(1974) 11 Harv.J.Legis. 463, 476; Miller, <em>Enforcing the Coastal Act\u2014Citizens Suits and Attorneys Fees </em>(1974) 49 State Bar J. 236, 342-343.)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thus, since the majority\u2019s interpretation of the statute leads to results clearly at variance with the legislative intent in adopting the section, past cases establish that such an interpretation must be rejected. \u201c \u2018Certainly the language of a statute should never be so construed as to nullify the will of the legislature, or to cause the law to conflict with the apparent purpose had in view by the lawmakers.\u2019 \u201d <em>{Dickey </em>v. <em>Raisin Proration Zone No. 1, supra, </em>24 Cal.2d 796, 802; see, e.g., <em>East Bay Garbage Co. </em>v. <em>Washington Township Sanitation Co. </em>(1959) 52 Cal.2d 708, 713 [344 P.2d 289].)</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">Accordingly, I believe that the trial court erred in interpreting section 27428 as according respondents a right to an attorneys fee award.

In the face of a history of administrative decisions that ignored environmental impacts and against a tide of legislative delays in developing pollution control law, citizens concluded th\u00e1t they must use the courts to cure the neglect. The citizen litigation has not only challenged specific government and private actions which were environmentally undesirable, it has speeded court definition of what is required of Federal agencies under environmental protection statutes.\u201d (U.S. Council on Envir.

(198 Cal.App.2d at p. 382.) In California, however, it has been clear for well over a half-century that such legislative differentiation is constitutionally permissible so long as it is \u201cbased upon some difference bearing a reasonable and just relation\u201d to a permissible legislative purpose. <em>(Engebretson </em>v. <em>Gay </em>(1910) 158 Cal. 30, 32-33 [109 P. 880]; see also <em>Beyerbach v. Juno Oil Co. </em>(1954) 42 Cal.2d 11, 22 [265 P.2d 1]; <em>Atchison, Topeka, &amp; Santa Fe R. Co. </em>v. <em>Matthews </em>(1899) 174 U.S. 96 [43 L.Ed. 909, 19 S.Ct. 609].)

Section 27428, however,, does not confine its reach to frivolous actions or grant a trial court discretion to award or withhold attorneys fees, but rather provides that a trial court \u201cshall\u201d award attorneys fees in all situations encompassed by the statute. Accordingly, if respondents\u2019 interpretation were adopted, \u201cprivate attorney general\u201d plaintiffs who act in the highest good faith would inevitably face the ominous prospect of a large attorney fee liability if their claim should ultimately be rejected.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b196-7\"> Retired Associate Justice of the Supreme Court sitting under assignment by the Chairman of the Judicial Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
