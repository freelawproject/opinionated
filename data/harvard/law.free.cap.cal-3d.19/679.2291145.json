In the instant case we confront the related question whether vested \u201ctermination benefits\u201d contained in an insurance sales agent\u2019s agreement with an insurer also represent such a divisible property interest. We conclude that they do. To implement their division under the particular circumstances of the instant case, we deem itmecessary and appropriate to indicate certain guidelines and procedures. We reverse the judgment and remand the cause for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-9\">Heidrun and Gary Skaden were married in 1961 and separated in 1973. Starting in 1965 Gaiy was an insurance sales agent of State Farm Insurance Companies (State Farm) working under the provisions of a contract entitled \u201cState Farm Agent\u2019s Agreement,\u201d which was executed at the commencement of the agency relationship. The agreement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>provided inter alia that if it were terminated two years or more after its effective date, whether by death of the agent or by written notice of either party, the agent was to receive certain \u201ctermination benefits.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> These benefits consisted in general of specified percentages of net premiums, collected within a five-year period after termination, on policies that were credited to the agent\u2019s account on the date of termination.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Payments were to be made on an installment basis, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>extending over a five-year period,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and were to be subject to specified conditions relating to competitive activities on the part of the terminated agent.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b693-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>The trial court found and concluded that the above mentioned termination benefits \u201care not divisible community property but merely an expectancy and a continuation of [Gary\u2019s] earnings, not presently capable of ascertainment or computation and therefore of no value.\u201d In the interlocutory judgment of dissolution of marriage, entered on June 23, 1975, the court awarded such benefits to Gary \u201cas his sole and separate property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">Heidrun appeals from the judgment, contending that the above termination benefits, like the pension rights involved in <em>Brown, </em>represent a form of deferred compensation for services rendered. This compensation, she argues, deriving from the terms of the agent\u2019s agreement, constituted a property right subject to division upon or following dissolution to the extent that it was community in character.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">Although we are mindful of the risk of imprecision inherent in any comparison of the descriptions of forms of property claimed to be similar, we nevertheless think it illuminating to examine the rights here in question in the light of the terminology used by us in <em>Brown. </em> As we there explained, the use of the term \u201cvested\u201d has acquired a special meaning in the context of divorce and dissolution. A right which is \u201cvested\u201d for these purposes, we stated, is one which \u201csurvives the discharge or voluntary termination of the employee.\u201d (15 Cal.3d at p. 842.) Such a \u201cvested\u201d right may be either \u201cmatured\u201d or \u201cimmature.\u201d If payment is subject to one or more conditions\u2014e.g., a condition of survival to a specified time\u2014the right is said to be \u201cvested\u201d but \u201cimmature.\u201d If on the other hand it is subject to no conditions and constitutes an \u201cunconditional right to immediate payment,\u201d it is said to be \u201cmatured.\u201d <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">We believe that the right to termination benefits involved in the instant case must be considered \u201cvested\u201d for present purposes. By the terms of the agent\u2019s agreement and subject to the conditions there set forth in paragraphs 2 and 3 of section IV (see fns. 3 and 4, <em>ante), </em>the right arises two years after the effective date of the agreement\u2014a date <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>long past when the dissolution proceedings were commenced. By the same token, however, the right was \u201cimmature\u201d at that time: no termination of the agent\u2019s agreement had occurred, and the post-termination conditions of payment had not been fulfilled. Thus we are here concerned with a \u201cvested\u201d but \u201cimmature\u201d right.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">It is clear in the context of retirement pensions that a \u201cvested\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> but \u201cimmature\u201d pension right is property subject to division upon dissolution to the extent of its community character. <em>(Brown, supra, </em>15 Cal.3d at p. 847; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Lewis </em>(1975) 13 Cal.3d 349, 355, fn. 4 [118 Cal.Rptr. 621, 530 P.2d 589, 78 A.L.R.3d 231]; <em>In re Marriage of Fithian </em>(1974) 10 Cal.3d 592, 596, fn. 2 [111 Cal.Rptr. 369, 517 P.2d 449].) The fundamental question in this case, therefore, is whether the rights here in question differ in character from vested pension rights to an extent which would justify treating them differently.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">Pension benefits, we held in <em>Brown, </em>\u201crepresent a form of deferred compensation for services rendered.\u201d (15 Cal.3d at p. 845.) \u201c[T]he employee\u2019s right to such benefits is a contractual right, derived from the terms of the employment contract,\u201d and as such \u201cis not an expectancy but a chose in action, a form of property.\u201d <em>(Id.) </em> The benefits involved in the instant case, Heidrun urges, are identical in character, and the right to them, also derived from the terms of the agreement, is likewise not a mere expectancy but a chose in action\u2014and therefore property subject to division upon dissolution. Gaiy, on the other hand, urges that the benefits here in question are fundamentally different from pension benefits. Rather than being a form of deferred compensation for services rendered, he contends, they represent \u201cconsideration for termination,\u201d the right to which arises only upon termination. Alternatively he seems to argue that the termination benefits constitute consideration for the agent\u2019s forebearance from undertaking certain business pursuits <em>after </em>termination as, for example, the competitive activities which are the subject of the conditions set forth in section IV, paragraph 3 of the agreement. (See fn. 4, <em>ante.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">We have concluded that Heidrun\u2019s position is the correct one. The agreement provides that termination benefits are payable \u201c[i]n the event this Agreement is terminated two years or more after its effective date . .. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>subject to the conditions set forth in paragraphs 2 and 3 . ..\u201d (quoted in fns. 3 and 4, <em>ante). </em>Nothing in the agreement suggests that such benefits are \u201cconsideration for termination.\u201d Moreover, termination may occur under the agreement in one of three ways: (1) upon written notice by the agent, (2) upon written notice by the company, or (3) upon the death of the agent. It is difficult to understand how payments made \u201cin the event\u201d of termination may be characterized as \u201cconsideration\u201d for such termination when that event may be involuntary as, for example, upon the agent\u2019s death or the company\u2019s written notice, rather than upon the written notice of the agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-4\">The suggestion that the benefits here in question should be characterized as consideration for the agent\u2019s post-termination compliance with conditions set forth in paragraphs 2 and 3 of the agreement is equally devoid of merit. Again the terms of the agreement, which make payment \u201csubject to\u201d these conditions, nowhere indicate that compliance with them is the \u201cperformance\u201d on the part of the agent for which payment is to be made. If this were so, we would expect the amount of payment to depend directly upon the degree of compliance. Under the terms of the agreement, however, the amount of payment relates directly to the number and character of policies credited to the account of the agent at the time of termination, subject to adjustment according to the extent of the agent\u2019s compliance with conditions of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">As we pointed out in <em>Waite </em>v. <em>Waite </em>(1972) 6 Cal.3d 461 [99 Cal.Rptr. 325, 492 P.2d 13], the fact that the payment of benefits, the right to which has vested, is subject to a condition whose fulfillment is wholly within the control of the employee spouse does not affect the vested nature of the right or degrade it into an \u201cexpectancy.\u201d (6 Cal.3d at p. 472; see also <em>Brown, supra, </em>15 Cal.3d at pp. 844, 846, fn. 8; <em>In re Marriage of Peterson </em>(1974) 41 Cal.App.3d 642, 650-651 [115 Cal.Rptr. 184].)</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">We think it clear from the foregoing that the termination benefits contemplated by the subject contract were, like pension benefits, \u201ca form of deferred compensation for services rendered.\u201d The right to these benefits \u201cderived from the terms of the employment contract\u201d and under those terms became vested upon the expiration of two years after the date of execution. Manifestly, then, under the cases we have cited (see text accompanying fn. 6, <em>ante), </em>that right is property subject to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>division, to the extent of its community character, upon dissolution of the marriage.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>(Civ. Code, \u00a7 4800.)</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">It remains for us to consider the proper method for the division of the termination benefits as marital property. In addressing a similar question in <em>Brown </em>we indicated two basic solutions of this problem: first, a determination by the trial court of the present value of the rights or benefits adjudged to be marital property and an equal division or adjustment of the same (see <em>Phillipson </em>v. <em>Board of Administration </em>(1970) 3 Cal.3d 32, 46-47 [89 Cal.Rptr. 61, 473 P.2d 765]; see also <em>Brown, supra, </em>15 Cal.3d at p. 848, fn. 10); and second, \u201cif the court concludes that because of uncertainties affecting the vesting or maturation of [such] rights ... it should not attempt to divide the present value ... it can instead award each spouse an appropriate portion of each . .. payment as it is paid.\u201d <em>{Brown, supra, </em>15 Cal.3d at p. 848.) The latter solution, which has been used in the division of vested pension rights <em>{id., </em>at p. 849), has the additional advantage of removing from the employee spouse the risk of paying the community for rights which may not mature/ (See Note (1973) 24 Hastings L.J. 347, 356.) On the other hand, it has the disadvantage of requiring the court to reserve jurisdiction in order to supervise any future payments and their proper division,at a date which may lie far in the future\u2014a procedure which may have unsatisfactory elements of delay for each of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">We believe that in cases of this kind the matter of the proper division of rights to termination benefits as marital property sh\u00f3uld be left to the sound discretion of the trial court, exercised in light of the particular circumstances of the case. We anticipate that in many instances the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>parties, seeking to achieve a final determination at the time of dissolution, may be able to reach some reasonable agreement and settlement relative to the present disposition of the rights in question. In cases where this is not possible the court will of necessity be called upon to make an assessment of the relative feasibility of present valuation by actuarial means (see generally Projector, <em>Valuation of Retirement Benefits in Marriage Dissolutions </em>(1975) 50 L.A. Bar Bull. 229) before choosing between that approach and the expedient of reserving jurisdiction so as to determine value and effectuate a disposition of the property at some time in the future. We apprehend that depending on the evidence before it, a myriad of considerations may have a bearing on the trial court\u2019s exercise of discretion in resolving the problem. In the instant case, the court, having decided that the termination benefits did not constitute divisible community property, was not called upon to address the questions of present valuation or reservation of jurisdiction for valuation at a future time. Accordingly, we think the cause should be remanded to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with the views expressed in this opinion. A division or evaluation of Gary\u2019s interest in the termination benefits may require a readjustment in the division of the community property. (See <em>In re Marriage of Fonstein </em>(1976) 17 Cal.3d 738, 751 [131 Cal.Rptr. 873, 552 P.2d 1169].)</p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\">Finally, we conclude that the same rule of retroactive application announced by us in <em>Brown </em>should obtain in the area of termination benefits. Accordingly, we further hold that our decision today should not apply retroactively to permit a nonemployee spouse to assert an interest in vested rights to termination benefits when the property rights of the marriage have already been finally adjudicated unless the decree expressly reserved jurisdiction to divide such benefits or the rights thereto at a later date. Our decision will apply, however, to any case in which the property rights arising from the marriage have not been adjudicated, to any case in which such an adjudication is still subject to appellate review, or to any case in which the trial court has expressly reserved jurisdiction to divide termination benefits or the rights thereto. (See <em>Brown, supra, </em>15 Cal.3d at p. 851.)</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">The interlocutory judgment of dissolution is reversed and the cause is remanded for further proceedings consistent with the views expressed herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>Tobriner, Acting, C.

This point was raised for the first time on appeal and no facts were developed relative to it in the trial court. We therefore do not consider it here. (See <em>Harriman </em>v. <em>Tetik </em>(1961) 56 Cal.2d 805, 810 [17 Cal.Rptr. 134, 366 P.2d 486]; cf. <em>Ward v. Taggart </em>(1959) 51 Cal.2d 736, 742 [336 P.2d 534].)
