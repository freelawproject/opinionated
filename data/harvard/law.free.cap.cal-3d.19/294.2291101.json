J.</author>\n<p id=\"Af\">In 1972, the City of Los Angeles enacted municipal ordinance regulating the size, weight, appearance and placement of newsracks installed and maintained on the city\u2019s sidewalks'.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Three years later, after a number of its newsracks had been removed from their sidewalk locations pursuant to the provisions of the ordinance, plaintiff Kash Enterprises, Inc. instituted an action for declaratory a'nd injunctive relief, attacking the ordinance as unconstitutional on i(s (ace and contending that the ordinance had been discriminatorily enforced against newsracks containing newspapers which Kash had published and distributed. Kash thereafter moved for a preliminary injunction, relying solely on its constitutional challenge to the ordinance\u2019s facial validity, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>and reserving the <em>discriminatory </em>enforcement issue for a subsequent trial. After a hearing, the trial court denied the requested preliminary injunction, and plaintiff now appeals from that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">Plaintiff contends that the challenged ordinance is unconstitutional on its face in two respects. First, plaintiff asserts that a number of the substantive provisions of the ordinance, limiting the placement and appearance of newsracks, are impermissibly vague and overbroad. Second, plaintiff maintains that the principal enforcement mechanism provided by the ordinance\u2014the summary seizure, retention and destruction of offending newsracks without according a newsrack owner any hearing as to the validity of the seizure\u2014violates both procedural due process and First Amendment principles. As we explain, although we have determined that the substantive provisions of the ordinance\u2014as written or as interpreted in this opinion\u2014are sufficiently definite and narrowly drawn to pass constitutional muster, we conclude that the ordinance\u2019s seizure provision is unconstitutional on its face. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court erred in refusing to grant a preliminary injunction as to that portion of the ordinance authorizing such seizure, retention and destruction of newsracks.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">1. <em>The substantive provisions of the challenged ordinance, as interpreted in this opinion, are sufficiently definite and narrowly drawn to constitute reasonable \u201ctime, place and manner\u201d regulations of First Amendment activity, and therefore such provisions are not unconstitutional on their face.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">In evaluating the constitutionality of section 42.00, subdivisions (f) (1) to (f) (6) of the Los Angeles Municipal Code,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the municipal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>newsrack regulations at issue here, we must begin by recognizing that the right to distribute newspapers and other periodicals on the public.streets lies at the heart of our constitutional guarantees of freedom of speech and freedom of the press. As both the United States Supreme Court and this court have emphasized on numerous occasions: \u201cWherever the title of streets and parks may rest, they have immemorially been held in trust for the use of the public and, time out of mind, have been used for the purpose of assembly, communicating thoughts between citizens, and discussing public questions.\u201d <em>(Hague </em>v. <em>C.I.O. </em>(1939) 307 U.S. 496, 515 [83 L.Ed. 1423, 1436, 59 S.Ct. 954].)</p>\n<p id=\"b333-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>Moreover, our decisions have repeatedly recognized that First Amendment protection extends not only to traditional street comer, soap-box speeches (see, e.g., <em>Terminiello v. Chicago </em>(1949) 337 U.S. 1 [93 L.Ed. 1131, 69 S.Ct. 894]), but to virtually all modes of communication that may be utilized to disseminate ideas and protected expression on the public streets. Thus, past cases have found that demonstrations and parades <em>{Dillon </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 860 [94 Cal.Rptr. 777, 484 P.2d 945]), picketing <em>{Police Department of Chicago </em>v. <em>Mosley </em>(1972) 408 U.S. 92 [33 L.Ed.2d 212, 92 S.Ct. 2286]), leafletting <em>{Schneider </em>v. <em>State </em>(1939) 308 U.S. 147 [84 L.Ed. 155, 60 S.Ct. 146]), sound truck broadcasts <em>{Wollam </em>v. <em>City of Palm Springs </em>(1963) 59 Cal.2d 276 [29 Cal.Rptr. 1, 379 P.2d 481]) and even the posting of signs on public utility poles <em>{Dulaney </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 77 [112 Cal.Rptr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>777, 520 P.2d 1]) fall \u201cwithin the protective umbrella of the First Amendment.\u201d <em>{Id., </em>at p. 84.)</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">Applying the general constitutional principles underlying the above line of authority, numerous courts\u2014both in California and out-of-state\u2014have in recent years uniformly held that First Amendment protections are applicable to the public distribution of newspapers and periodicals through newsracks and that, as a consequence, municipalities lack constitutional authority to foreclose <em>jall </em>use of such newsracks on their streets and sidewalks. (See <em>California Newspaper Publishers Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>City of Burbank </em>(1975) 51 Cal.App.3d 50 [123 Cal.Rptr. 880]; <em>Remer </em>v. <em>City of El Cajon </em>(1975) 52 Cal.App.3d 441 [125 Cal.Rptr. 116]; <em>Philadelphia News., Inc. </em>v. <em>Borough C., etc., Swarthmore </em>(E.D.Pa. 1974) 381 F.Supp. 228; <em>Gannett Co. </em>v. <em>City of Rochester </em>(1972) 69 Misc.2d 619 [330 N.Y.S.2d 648].)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The City of Los Angeles does not challenge the broad holdings of these recent decisions, and we agree with their uniform conclusion that the dissemination of protected material on public streets by means of newsracks falls within the constitutional guarantees of freedom of speech and frefedom of the press.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">Although the distribution of periodicals through newsracks is thus entitled to constitutional protection, this principle does not ordain, of course, that newsracks are totally immune from regulation by local municipalities. As defendant city notes, every one of the recent decisions invalidating a broad \u201canti-newsrack\u201d ordinance has clearly indicated that localities retain authority to impose reasonable \u201ctime, place and manner\u201d regulations on the use of newsracks, so \u00e1s to protect legitimate state interests while preserving First Amendment rights. In <em>Remer </em>v. <em>City of El Cajon, supra, 52 </em>Cal.App.3d 441, 444, for example, the court, after invalidating an ordinance which barred all newsracks from public streets, stated: \u201cThe city might consider controlling the number, size, construction, placement and appearance of the vending devices in order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>to achieve its goals without unduly restricting the free dispersal of information.\u201d (See also <em>California Newspaper Publishers Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>City of Burbank, supra, </em>51 Cal.App.3d 50, 53-54; <em>Philadelphia News., Inc. </em>v. <em>Borough C., etc., Swarthmore, supra, </em>381 F.Supp. 228, 244; <em>Gannett Co. </em>v. <em>City of Rochester, supra, </em>330 N.Y.S.2d 648, 657.) The City of Los Angeles maintains that the ordinance challenged in the present case embodies just such a reasonable \u201ctime, place and manner\u201d regulation of newsracks and thus is constitutional on its face.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">Plaintiff, while conceding that defendant city may impose reasonable time, place, and manner regulations on newsracks, maintains that a number of the regulatoiy provisions of the challenged ordinance are, in effect, constitutionally \u201cunreasonable.\u201d  As plaintiff suggests, time, place and manner regulations of First Amendment activity are constitutionally reasonable only if they are clearly and narrowly drawn to avoid arbitrary and unnecessaiy curtailment of freedom of speech and freedom of the press. (See, e.g., <em>Grayned </em>v. <em>City of Rockford </em>(1972) 408 U.S. 104 [33 L.Ed.2d 222, 92 S.Ct. 2294]; <em>Wollam </em>v. <em>City of Palm Springs, supra, 59 </em>Cal.2d 276, 284-285.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Plaintiff suggests that several portions of the Los Angeles ordinance do not satisfy this rigorous constitutional standard and are either unjustifiably vague or impermissibly overbroad. As we explain, however, with but one minor exception which may be cured by appropriate interpretation, we conclude that the challenged regulations are sufficiently definite and narrowly tailored to survive plaintiff\u2019s constitutional challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">Plaintiff initially attacks the segment of the ordinance which prohibits the placement of a newsrack in a location that \u201cunreasonably interferes with or impedes the flow of pedestrian or vehicular traffic\u201d (\u00a7 42.00, subd. (f) (2)), asserting that the use of the term \u201cunreasonably\u201d renders the clause unduly vague and susceptible to arbitrary application. In <em>Cameron </em>v. <em>Johnson </em>(1968) 390 U.S. 611, 615-616 [20 L.Ed.2d 182, 186-188, 88 S.Ct. 1335], however, the United States Supreme Court rejected an almost identical vagueness attack on a .Mississippi statute which prohibited\" \u2018picketing ... in such a manner as to obstruct or unreasonably interfere with free ingress or egress to and from any . . . county ... courthouse.\u2019 \u201d Justice Brennan, writing for the <em>Cameron </em>court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>observed: \u201cAppellants . . . argue that the statute forbids picketing in terms \u2018so vague that men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application....\u2019 [Citation.] But... [t]he terms \u2018obstruct\u2019 and \u2018unreasonably interfere\u2019 plainly require no \u2018guessing] at [their] meaning.\u2019 Appellants focus on the word \u2018unreasonably.\u2019 It is a widely used and well understood word and clearly so when juxtaposed with \u2018obstruct\u2019 and \u2018interfere.\u2019 We conclude that the statute clearly and precisely delineates its reach in words of common understanding.\u201d (Fns. omitted.) This reasoning applies equally to the Los Angeles ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">Plaintiff secondly challenges the portion of the ordinance which precludes the installation or maintenance of a newsrack \u201cwhen such news rack interferes with the cleaning of any sidewalk by the use of mechanical sidewalk cleaning machinery.\u201d (\u00a7 42.00, subd. (f) (2).) Relying on numerous decisions which have held that First Amendment rights of distribution may not be entirely foreclosed to serve the state\u2019s interest in clean streets (see, e.g., <em>Schneider </em>v. <em>State, supra, </em>308 U.S. 147, 162-163 [84 L.Ed. 155, 165-166]; <em>Van Nuys Pub. Co. </em>v. <em>City of Thousand Oaks </em>(1971) 5 Cal.3d 817, 822 [97 Cal.Rptr. 777, 489 P.2d 809]), plaintiff asserts that the instant provision mandates just such a sacrifice of First Amendment rights upon the altar of \u201cmechanically clean\u201d sidewalks. As we interpret this provision, however, it does not purport to authorize a broad prohibition of newsrack placement on sidewalks but rather simply requires that newsracks be positioned\u2014and perhaps designed\u2014so as to minimize interference with the city\u2019s mechanical sidewalk cleaning machineiy. So long as such a requirement does not unduly hamper the distribution of newspapers through newsracks, we believe the city is entitled to demand this limited accommodation to facilitate the cleaning of its sidewalks. Of course, if plaintiff demonstrates at trial that the city\u2019s use of particular sidewalk cleaning machinery in practice results in a complete or unreasonable limitation on newsracks in a given location, the ordinance\u2019s restriction\u2014as so applied\u2014could not be sustained. Judged on its face, however, the challenged provision is not unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">Plaintiff thirdly contests the validity of that portion of the ordinance which provides that no newsrack shall be placed \u201c[wjithin three feet of any area improved with lawn, flowers, shrubs or trees\u201d (\u00a7 42.00, subd. (f)(3)(F)(8)), claiming that the phrase \u201cimproved with\u201d is vague and indefinite. In our view, however, the phrase is quite clear and easily understood, simply prohibiting the placement of racks within three feet of any lawn, flowers, shrubs or trees. Again, in the absence of any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>showing that the provision unduly restricts the use of newsracks in the City of Los Angeles, we think that the regulation on its face represents a reasonable accommodation of the city\u2019s interest in maintaining greeneiy in an urban environment and the First Amendment interests served by newsracks. (See, e.g., <em>Blasecki </em>v. <em>City of Durham, North Carolina </em>(4th Cir. 1972) 456 F.2d 87, 92-93; cf. <em>Collin </em>v. <em>Chicago Park District </em>(7th Cir. 1972) 460 F.2d 746, 751-752.)</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">Finally, plaintiff objects to a section of the ordinance which mandates that \u201c[e]ach news rack shall be maintained in a clean, neat and attractive condition and in good repair at all times.\u201d (\u00a7 42.00, subd. (f) (3)(H).) Acknowledging that past decisions have recognized a municipality\u2019s authority to enact reasonable newsrack regulations aimed at preserving the good appearance of the public streets (see, e.g., <em>Remer </em>v. <em>City of El Cajon, supra, </em>52 Cal.App.3d 441, 444; <em>Philadelphia News., Inc. </em>v. <em>Borough C., etc. Swarthmore, supra, </em>381 F.S\u00fapp. 228, 244), plaintiff maintains that the present appearance regulation is unacceptably vague in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">In our view, however, the only portion of the section in question which is properly subject to such an attack is the requirement that newsracks be maintained in an \u201cattractive condition.\u201d Insofar as this requirement may be interpreted to impose an aesthetic standard distinct from the commonly accepted meaning of the terms \u201cclean\u201d and \u201cneat,\u201d it exposes a newsrack owner to criminal sanction on the basis of a totally subjective aesthetic judgment, a judgment which will invariably vary with the personal taste of individual police officers, municipal inspectors or the ultimate triers of fact in any criminal proceeding. Because such a reading of the term \u201cattractive\u201d would pose obvious constitutional problems in light of its vagueness and potential for arbitrary application (see <em>Gannett Co. </em>v. <em>City of Rochester, supra, </em>330 N.Y.S.2d 648, 657; accord <em>Coates </em>v. <em>City of Cincinnati </em>(1971) 402 U.S. 611, 614-616 [29 L.Ed.2d 214, 217-219, 91 S.Ct. 1686]), we conclude, in conformance with the general principle that legislation should be construed, if reasonably possible, to preserve its constitutionality (see, e.g., <em>San Francisco Unified School Dist. </em>v. <em>Johnson </em>(1971) 3 Cal.3d 937, 948 [92 Cal.Rptr. 309, 479 P.2d 669]), that the term \u201cattractive\u201d must be interpreted in this context simply as a synonym for \u201cneat\u201d and \u201cclean\u201d and not as an independent aesthetic requirement. As so interpreted we conclude that this provision is not unconstitutional on its face.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">Thus, in sum, contrary to plaintiff\u2019s contentions we conclude that the challenged ordinance\u2019s substantive \u201ctime, place and manner\u201d regula<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>tions, as construed in this opinion, are adequate to meet constitutional standards. As we explain below, however, the procedural aspects of the challenged ordinance do not fare so well when weighed in the constitutional balance.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">2. <em>In authorizing the </em>seizure, <em>retention and destruction of newsracks without affording the owner of the rack either a pre- or post-taking hearing the newsrack ordinance violates fundamental procedural due process and First Amendment precepts.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">Under the general provisions of the Los Angeles Municipal Code, a newsrack owner who places a newsrack on a public sidewalk in violation of any of the ordinance\u2019s provisions is guilty of a misdemeanor, and may be punished by up to a $500 fine or six months imprisonment. (Los Angeles Mun. Code, \u00a7 11.00, subd. (m).) In addition to this traditional criminal sanction, subdivision (5) of the challenged ordinance authorizes a public officer summarily to remove any newsrack which he believes to be in violation of the ordinance\u2019s size, weight, appearance or location requirements prior to affording the newsrack owner any notice of the removal. (\u00a7 42.00, subd. (f) (5), set out in fn. 2, <em>ante.)* ***</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em>\n</em> The subdivision further provides that after such summary removal, the board of public works commissioners shall notify the owner of the seizure of the rack and the place of its storage, and shall inform the owner that unless he claims the rack within 45 days and pays the cost of removal as determined by the board, the rack will be deemed abandoned and will be destroyed. <em>(Id.)</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">Thus, although a newsrack owner is ultimately provided notice of the seizure after the removal of his rack, the present ordinance accords him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>absolutely no opportunity for a hearing on the merits of the seizure, either before or after the removal.  No matter how arbitrary or wrongful the removal may have been, under the terms of the ordinance an owner can never recover his rack without paying the administrative cost of removal; if he does not pay the fee, the city destroys the newsrack.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We must concur in plaintiff\u2019s claim that the procedure established by the ordinance violates both procedural due process and the First Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">\n<em>(a) Procedural due process.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">\u201cWe start with the basic proposition that in eveiy case involving a deprivation of property within the purview of the due process clause, the Constitution requires some form of notice and a hearing.\u201d (Beau<em>dreau </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1975) 14 Cal.3d 448, 458 [121 Cal.Rptr. 585, 535 P.2d 713].) As the United States Supreme Court noted more than a quarter century ago: \u201cMany controversies have raged about the cryptic and abstract words of the Due Process Clause but there can be no doubt that at a minimum they require that deprivation of life, liberty or property ... be preceded by notice and opportunity for hearing appropriate to the nature of the case.\u201d <em>(Mullane </em>v. <em>Central Hanover Tr. Co. </em>(1950) 339 U.S. 306, 313 [94 L.Ed. 865, 872-873, 70 S.Ct. 652].) The vitality of this due process principle was reaffirmed by the Supreme Court only last term: \u201cThis Court consistently has held that some form of hearing is required before an individual is finally deprived of a property interest.\u201d <em>(Mathews </em>v. <em>Eldridge </em>(1976) 424 U.S. 319, 333 [47 L.Ed.2d 18, 32, 96 S.Ct. 893].)</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>As a series of recent procedural due process authorities establish, the Constitution generally requires that an individual be accorded notice and some form of hearing before he is deprived of a protected property or liberty interest. (See, e.g., <em>North Georgia Finishing, Inc. </em>v. <em>Di-Chem, Inc. </em>(1975) 419 U.S. 601 [42 L.Ed.2d 751, 95 S.Ct. 719]; <em>Shelly </em>v. <em>State Personnel Bd. </em>(1975) 15 Cal.3d 194, 215 [124 Cal.Rptr. 14, 539 P.2d <em>774].) </em><em> </em>The decisions have also recognized, however, that in particular circumstances important governmental interests may justify the postponement of notice and hearing until after the initial \u201ctaking\u201d has occurred. (See, e.g., <em>Calero-Toledo </em>v. <em>Pearson Yacht Leasing Co. </em>(1974) 416 U.S. 663, 676-680 [40 L.Ed.2d 452, 464-466, 94 S.Ct. 2080] (seizure of vessel used to smuggle drugs); <em>North American Storage Co. </em>v. <em>Chicago </em>(1908) 211 U.S. 306 [53 L.Ed. 195, 29 S.Ct. 101] (seizure of contaminated food); <em>Ewing </em>v. <em>Mytinger &amp; Casselberry </em>(1950) 339 U.S. 594 [94 L.Ed. 1088, 70 S.Ct. 870] (seizure of misbranded drugs).) Even when such special considerations pertain, however, the cases have stressed that an opportunity to be heard may only be postponed, not entirely eliminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">In the instant case, defendant city cannot realistically contend that its seizure, retention and, on occasion, ultimate destruction of newsracks pursuant to the challenged ordinance does not constitute a \u201ctaking\u201d of a protected property interest within the meaning of the controlling constitutional, authorities. Although the record does not indicate the market value of a newsrack, recent decisions make clear that due process protections apply to takings of all non-\u201cde minimis\u201d property interests (see, e.g., <em>North Georgia Finishing, Inc. </em>v. <em>Di-Chem, Inc., supra, </em>419 U.S. 601, 608 [42 L.Ed.2d 751, 758]; <em>Randone v. Appellate Department </em>(1971) 5 Cal.3d 536, 552 [96 Cal.Rptr. 709, 488 P.2d 13]); a newsrack clearly falls within this categoiy. Similarly, recent authorities teach that the allegedly temporary nature of a taking does not necessarily obviate the need for at least some due process protections (see, e.g., <em>Connelly Development, Inc. v. Superior Court </em>(1976) 17 Cal.3d 803, 811-812 [132 Cal.Rptr. 477, 553 P.2d 637]; <em>Beaudreau s. Superior Court, supra, 14 </em>Cal.3d 448, 455); in any event, the <em>taking </em>sanctioned here is not merely temporary, for the ordinance authorizes the actual destruction of a confiscated newsrack if an owner refuses permanently to part with a fee to cover the city\u2019s average expenditure in removing a newsrack.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Consequently, there can be no doubt of the necessity of testing the validity of the ordinance\u2019s seizure procedure against the strictures of due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>Under the principles reviewed above, the challenged ordinance clearly fails that constitutional test. Although the ordinance authorizes a taking of a newsrack owner\u2019s property, it does not accord the owner the most basic safeguard demanded by due process\u2014an opportunity to be heard on the merits of the taking, either before or after the taking. In the face of this fundamental constitutional defect, section 5 of the ordinance cannot stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">In an attempt to overcome this obvious deficiency, defendant city contends that since the newsrack owner, after receiving notice that his property has been seized, retains the option of instituting his own action against the city for the return of the rack, the owner in effect does have some opportunity to be heard on the merits of the taking. Not one of the scores of recent procedural due process decisions, however, suggests that the availability of a collateral judicial remedy can sustain a seizure procedure which provides absolutely no hearing whatsoever, either before or after the taking. (See, e.g., <em>Sniadach </em>v. <em>Family Finance Corp. </em>(1969) 395 U.S. 337 [23 L.Ed.2d 349, 89 S.Ct. 1820]; <em>Goldberg </em>v. <em>Kelly </em>(1970) 397 U.S. 254 [25 L.Ed.2d 287, 90 S.Ct. 1011].) Acceptance of the city\u2019s position would in effect read out almost all of the protections afforded by contemporary procedural due process doctrine, and would place on the party whose property has been taken the additional financial burden of instituting an action for the property\u2019s return. Accordingly, we conclude that subdivision (5) of the ordinance is unconstitutional insofar as it provides for the seizure, retention and destruction of newsracks without affording the owner any hearing on the merits of the seizure.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">\n<em>b. First Amendment \u201cdue process.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">Moreover, the challenged removal provision is additionally defective because the seizure of newsracks implicates not only the owner\u2019s property rights but also the public\u2019s First Amendment rights.  As we shall explain, although the First Amendment does not immunize newsracks from immediate, pre-notice seizure in all circumstances, the Constitution does require that any such summary seizure procedure be narrowly drafted so as to minimize interference with First Amendment rights. The present provision does not satisfy this constitutional imperative.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-9\">As we have seen, subdivision (5) authorizes any public officer, on his own volition, to remove from a public sidewalk any news-rack that he believes is in violation of any one of the numerous size, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>weight, appearance or location regulations contained in the ordinance. The removal of a newsrack pursuant to this provision will generally result, of course, in the immediate suppression of any newspapers or other periodicals which are contained within the rack at the time of removal. Although a newsrack owner will subsequently receive notice of the seizure and will be permitted to recover his rack upon payment of a fee, such recovery in the case of a daily newspaper will invariably come too late to avoid the total suppression of the newsworthy contents of the seized papers.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">Moreover, while in some cases the seizure of a single newsrack will constitute only a minor inconvenience to the public if the newspaper or periodical contained in the rack is available at a nearby store or newsstand, stores and newsstands do not cany all publications nor are such establishments open at all hours. (See fn. 3, <em>ante.) </em>Thus, the seizure of a newsrack can have a significant, deleterious effect on the dissemination of protected expression.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">The city defends the challenged seizure procedure as a reasonable means of enforcing its time, place, and manner regulations on news-racks.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>\n                   But, as a series of cases of both the United States Supreme Court and this court teach, \u201cunder the Fourteenth Amendment, a State is not free to adopt whatever procedures it pleases [in enforcing valid regulations] . . . without regard to the possible consequences for constitutionally protected speech.\u201d <em>(Marcus </em>v. <em>Search Warrant </em>(1961) 367 U.S. 717, 731 [6 L.Ed.2d 1127, 1136, 81 S.Ct. 1708]; see, e.g., <em>Speiser </em>v. <em>Randall </em>(1958) 357 U.S. 513, 520 [2 L.Ed.2d 1460, 1469, 78 S.Ct. 1332]; <em>Freedman </em>v. <em>Maryland </em>(1965) 380 U.S. 51, 57-58 [13 L.Ed.2d 649, 653-654, 85 S.Ct. 734]; <em>Carroll </em>v. <em>Princess Anne </em>(1968) 393 U.S. 175, 180-185 [21 L.Ed.2d 325, 330-333, 89 S.Ct. 347]; <em>Flack </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1967) 66 Cal.2d 981, 989-993 [59 Cal.Rptr. 872, 429 P.2d 192]. See generally Monaghan, <em>First Amendment \u201cDue Process\u201d </em>(1970) 83 Harv.L.Rev. 518.)</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">Thus, for example, in <em>Flack </em>v. <em>Municipal Court, supra, </em>66 Cal.2d 981, 990-991, we held that \u201c[w]hile it is settled that in the ordinary case a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>search incident to an arrest is not \u2018unreasonable\u2019 if the arrest itself is lawful [citations], the First Amendment compels more restrictive rules in cases in which the arrest and search relate to alleged obscenity.... [W]ith the exception of a situation involving a legitimate emergency, even if the search is contemporaneous with an arrest, a search warrant must be secured prior to any search for or seizure of material alleged to be obscene.\u201d (Fns. omitted.) Similarly, in <em>Carroll </em>v. <em>Princess Anne, supra, </em>393 U.S. 175, 180 [21 L.Ed.2d 325, 330-331], the United States Supreme Court stressed the need for especially sensitive procedures in the First Amendment field: \u201cThere is a place in our jurisprudence for <em>ex parte </em>issuance, without notice, of temporary restraining orders of short duration; but there is no place within the area of basic freedoms guaranteed by the First Amendment for such orders where no showing is made that it is impossible to serve or to notify the opposing parties and to give them an opportunity to participate.\u201d (See also <em>United Farm Workers of America </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1975) 14 Cal.3d 902 [122 Cal.Rptr. 877, 537 P.2d 1237].)</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">The city argues that the ordinance\u2019s seizure provision does take First Amendment concerns into account, since it explicitly precludes the removal of any newsrack on the basis of the content of the material within the rack. (See fn. 5, <em>ante.) </em>Emphasizing that most of the ordinance\u2019s regulations are intended to prevent interference with pedestrian or vehicular traffic, the city maintains that the public interest in the immediate elimination of any such hazard justifies whatever incidental harm to First Amendment values results from the summary seizure of offending newsracks. In this regard, the city analogizes the seizure of newsracks under subdivision (f) (5) to the summary seizure of illegally parked or abandoned automobiles pursuant to Vehicle Code section 22650 et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">Although we cannot agree that the removal of newsracks from the public sidewalks can be equated with the removal of vehicles from the public streets\u2014the removal of illegally parked cars does not, after all, result in the suppression of protected expression\u2014we do believe that a comparison of the seizure provisions of the Los Angeles newsrack \u2022ordinance and the Vehicle Code provisions relied upon by defendant is instructive. Unlike the challenged newsrack ordinance, the Vehicle Code sections do not broadly s\u00e1nction the summary removal of a vehicle for <em>any </em>parking violation whatsoever, but rather generally authorize seizure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>only when an illegally parked vehicle actually \u201ccreates a hazard\u201d or \u201cconstitutes an obstruction\u201d to traffic. (See Veh. Code, \u00a7 22651, subds. (a) and (b).) Indeed, in several instances, the Vehicle Code sections specifically provide that even when a vehicle does constitute such a hazard, removal is authorized only when \u201cit is impractical to move such vehicle ... to another point on the highway.\u201d (See Veh. Code, \u00a7 22651, subds. (d) and (e).)</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">In contrast, subdivision (5) does not <em>limit its removal </em>sanction to violations which actually create hazards for pedestrians or motor vehicles or which otherwise interfere with the safe use of public streets or sidewalks. Instead, under the terms of the ordinance, a newsrack may be summarily removed\u2014and its contents consequently suppressed\u2014if the rack simply weighs a few pounds too much (\u00a7 42.00, subd. (f)(3)(E)) or if a pfiblic officer believes that the rack is not \u201cclean\u201d or \u201cneat.\u201d (\u00a7 42.00, subd. (f)(3)(H).) Moreover, the ordinance permits a public officer immediately to remove any rack which is not properly placed within the strict limits stipulated in the ordinance, even when the violation could be cured simply by moving the rack a few inches or a few feet.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">In light of the controversial nature of many of the newspapers and periodicals distributed through newsracks, and the fact that newsracks will often, in the course of normal use by the public, be jostled or moved into technical noncompliance with the ordinance\u2019s precise placement regulations, subdivision (5)\u2019s authorization of summary removal for <em>any </em>violation\u2014no matter how minor\u2014creates a very real risk that individual enforcement officers may consider a variety of extraneous factors, including the contents of a newsrack, in determining whether or not a particular rack should be removed from a public sidewalk. Past cases have pointed to the potential for such arbitrary or discriminatory suppression of protected expression at the hands of individual police officers as a primary justification for requiring that enforcement procedures in the First Amendment area be structured so as to minimize the danger of such unilateral censorship. (See, e.g., <em>Flack </em>v. <em>Municipal Court, supra, 66 </em>Cal.2d 981, 986-992; <em>Roaden </em>v. <em>Kentucky </em>(1973) 413 U.S. 496, 501-506 [37 L.Ed.2d 757, 762-766, 93 S.Ct. 2796]; <em>Stanford </em>v. <em>Texas </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>(1965) 379 U.S. 476, 485 [13 L.Ed.2d 431, 437, 85 S.Ct. 506]; <em>Marcus </em>v. <em>Search Warrant, supra, 367 </em>U.S. 717, 731-733 [6 L.Ed.2d 1127, 1135-1137].) Because subdivision (5) makes no attempt to limit an individual officer\u2019s summary seizure authority to situations in which immediate removal is mandated by public need (see <em>Roaden </em>v. <em>Kentucky, supra, </em>413 U.S. 496, 505 [37 L.Ed.2d 757, 765]; <em>Flack </em>v. <em>Municipal Court, supra, </em>66 Cal.2d 981, 991), we conclude that the subdivision is incompatible with governing First Amendment principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">Our holding in this regard, however, should not be misunderstood. We have no doubt that the City of Los Angeles is constitutionally empowered to provide for the immediate seizure, without prior notice or hearing, of any newsrack that poses a danger to pedestrians or vehicles. Moreover, even when no such danger is present, the city may authorize the seizure of an offending newsrack so long as the owner has been notified of the imminent seizure and has been given a reasonable opportunity either to cure the violation or to contest the seizure in an informal administrative forum. Finally, the city may, of course, impose alternative, constitutionally less intrusive sanctions, such as fines, to encourage owners to police their own newsracks to insure that the racks remain in compliance with the city\u2019s reasonable time, place and manner regulations. Obviously, however, it is for the city, and not this court, to decide what enforcement procedure, if any, should be established to replace the constitutionally deficient procedure contained in the present ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">3. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">In recent years, sidewalk newsracks have become, in turn, the subject of public concern, municipal regulation, and judicial controversy. In the present case, plaintiffs have mounted a broad-based attack on newsrack regulations enacted by the City of Los Angeles in 1972. As we have explained, we have determined that, as construed herein, the substantive time, place and manner regulations of the challenged ordinance are neither constitutionally vague nor overbroad. We have also concluded, however, that the section of the ordinance authorizing the summary removal, retention and destruction of offending newsracks is invalid on its face, both as a denial of procedural due process and as insufficiently sensitive to First Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>The judgment of the superior court is reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings consistent with the views expressed herein. Each party shall bear its own costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">Mosk, J., Clark, J., Richardson, J., Sullivan, J.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Wright, J.,<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> and Kaus, J.,<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark> concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b330-13\">Two years later, in June 1974, the city enacted two additional provisions, purporting to regulate the content of material disseminated through publicly located newsracks. <em>(See Los </em>Angeles Mun.

(f) (7), (f) (8) (quoted in fn. <em>2, post).) </em>These two provisions were held invalid in <em>Carl </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(1976) 61 Cal.App.3d 265 [132 Cal.Rptr. 365].

The earlier version did not specifically assign the enforcement task to the board of public works commissioners, and authorized the sale of unclaimed newsracks as well as their destruction. The earlier version, like the present section, however, authorized the removal of newsracks without prior notice to the owner and did not provide for a hearing on the merits of the removal at any time. Under settled principles, the version of the ordinance in force at present is the relevant legislation for purposes of this appeal. \u201cIt is ... an established'rule of law that on appeals from judgments granting or denying injunctions, the law to be applied is that which is current at tne time of judgment in the appellate court.\u201d <em>(Callie </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors </em>(1969) 1 Cal.App.3d 13, 18 [81 Cal.Rptr. 440]; see, e.g., <em>Complete Serv.

The official declared that the city generally \u201ctagged\u201d offending racks seven days prior to removal and that on several occasions the city had returned newsracks without payment of a fee when the owner satisfied the city that the removal had been unjustified. These representations, however, fall far short of establishing that the city has adopted a procedure which routinely affords a newsrack owner a hearing on the merits of the seizure of his newsrack.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">Furthermore, in judging the constitutionality of the procedure established by the ordinance, we must look to the procedure dictated by the terms of the ordinance, and not to informal practices implemented at the discretion of municipal administrators.
