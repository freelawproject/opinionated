A simultaneously entered discovery order granting plaintiffs\u2019 cross-motion is also a subject of this appeal. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-16\">Defendant shall provide to counsel for Plaintiffs the name, address and telephone number of each and every subscriber to The Bernardsville News as of August, 1995, for the reasons stated on the record, in open Court, and it is further ordered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>that Plaintiff shall give Defendant prior notice of the letter to be sent to Defendant\u2019s newspaper subscribers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">We reverse and dismiss the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">On August 9, 1995, an article on the first page of the Bernardsville News (the News), under the byline of David Polakiewicz, discussed the recent shut-down of SHA, a Bernardsville dealership:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-8\">The findings of a police investigation into the closing of the Somerset Hills Audi dealership last month have been forwarded to the Somerset County Prosecutor\u2019s Office to determine if any criminal charges are warranted against its owners. Detective Sgt. Kevin Valentine said Monday police began investigating the circumstances around the July 28 closing of the Morristown Road car dealership after complaints were received from employees that paychecks had bounced.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-9\">Valentine said that if the prosecutor\u2019s office finds criminal wrongdoing, a further investigation would be conducted. If found to be a civil matter, Valentine said police involvement would end. Former employees of the dealership would then have to pursue legal action themselves to recoup wages due from the owners of the defunct business.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-10\">Valentine said the closing occurred due to a financial dispute involving the dealership\u2019s owners and Volkswagen Credit Inc. (VCI) of Woodcliff Lake. The owners, he said, were apparently in arrears on payments owed to the credit company.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-11\">VCI obtained an order in state Superior Court in early July, Valentine said, which froze the assets of the dealership. The court document lists the owners of Somerset Hills Audi, Inc. as Paul Reynolds, James Sedore and Mayfair Investments, Inc.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-12\">Reynolds and Sedore could not be reached for comment on Tuesday.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b194-13\">The balance of the article gave an account of the alarmed reaction of dealership employees regarding their bounced paychecks, as well as the predicament of customers who had been taken by surprise by the closure of SHA.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-14\">The defamation suit was brought by James P. Sedore and Paul Reynolds, Jr. against the News; Polakiewicz, the reporter; The Recorder Publishing Co., publisher of the News; and Charles Zavalick, editor of the News. Plaintiffs contend that the defamation consisted of the false attribution to them of an ownership interest in SHA. They contend further that the News article\u2019s use <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>of the phrase \u201c[t]he court document\u201d incorrectly implied that the source of the ownership information was an order obtained by VCI. Plaintiffs maintain they were not owners of SHA, but \u201cvictims\u201d like the other employees, because their paychecks also bounced and they lost their jobs. Although plaintiffs acknowledge SHA\u2019s wrongdoing was accurately described in the article, they assert that because they were falsely named as owners, the wrongdoing was erroneously attributed to them by implication, injuring their reputations as a result, and causing them damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">Both Reynolds and Sedore had years of experience working with Audi. When an Audi dealership in Bernardsville, which had previously employed Reynolds, was up for sale in 1994, Reynolds went to David T. Lardier, President of Mayfair Investment Corporation (Mayfair), intending to borrow funds to purchase the dealership. Lardier instead decided to have his corporation buy the dealership, with Reynolds and Sedore to be minority shareholders owning interests of five percent each. Reynolds testified that he and Sedore were useful to Lardier because he \u201cneeded automobile experience to get a franchise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">SHA was incorporated on July 26, 1994. On September 12, 1994, a letter was sent to VCI as part of an application for a line of credit for \u201cfloor plan\u201d financing of new and used vehicles for the dealership. The letter described Lardier as \u201cdealer principal and president\u201d of SHA; Sedore as Vice President and General Manager; and Reynolds as Vice President. Both Sedore and Reynolds were termed \u201cminority shareholders,\u201d each possessing five percent of the corporate shares. The letter indicated that SHA had been capitalized by Lardier alone, and that Sedore and Reynolds \u201cwill not contribute to [SHA] financially____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">On October 10, 1994, Lardier\u2019s application for the Audi dealership was tentatively granted, primarily conditioned upon the dealership obtaining a $1,500,000 line of credit with VCI. An unsigned draft of the dealership agreement forwarded to Lardier by Audi in December of 1994 contained an addendum specifying that Reynolds and Sedore must \u201cat all times\u201d continue as operating manag<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>ers, and must each initially own five percent of the capital stock of the dealership, with the right to acquire more shares \u201con reasonable terms.\u201d Sedore confirmed in depositions that Audi\u2019s approval of SHA had been contingent upon his and Reynolds\u2019s involvement. Yet, he also indicated that Lardier returned the dealership agreement with the names of Reynolds and Sedore removed from it, and that as early as December, at an awards banquet in the Virgin Islands, Sedore informed a highly placed corporate official in Audi of North America that he and Reynolds were being excluded from ownership. According to Sedore, as a result of this conversation Audi informed Lardier again, in a letter sent in late December or early January, that the franchise agreement was contingent upon the inclusion of Reynolds and Sedore. Sedore testified that no actual dealership agreement was ever signed: SHA and Audi \u201cworked on a letter of intent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">In January of 1995, Reynolds and Sedore retained an attorney to help them claim their ownership shares of SHA. The attorney contacted a professional associate of Lardier, requesting copies of certain documents, with the professed purpose of \u201caehiev[ing] immediate finality\u201d with regard to the \u201cproper\u201d documentation of Reynolds\u2019s and Sedore\u2019s position as minority stockholders. A \u201cspecial counsel\u201d to SHA responded in a letter dated February 9, 1995, that Reynolds and Sedore were corporate officers, but not shareholders of SHA, and refused to provide the documentation requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">Reynolds testified in a deposition that sometime between November, 1994 and May 31, 1995, he had notified his customer base of more than 100 personal customers that he was returning to Bernardsville as a partner in the SHA dealership. Both Reynolds and Sedore spoke with the shop mechanics, as well, and told them that they were both to be part owners of the dealership. The sales/business manager and the assistant sales manager were also told that Reynolds and Sedore were owners along with Lardier.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">By July of 1995, VCI had taken legal action against SHA, Mayfair and Lardier because SHA was in arrears on payments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>owed to VCI for cars that had been sold. VCI was concerned about tracing \u201c$1.75 million in proceeds obtained from [SHA\u2019s] sale of more than 50 vehicles \u2018out of trust.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">On July 28, 1995, the dealership closed. SHA employees\u2019 paychecks had already bounced before that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">On July 31, 1995, a \u201cfinal judgment and order\u201d was entered against SHA, Mayfair and Lardier upon their default in making a payment of $350,000.00 to VCI\u2019s counsel as previously ordered by the court. VCI was awarded possession of the vehicles, parts and inventory of SHA; and SHA, Mayfair and Lardier were forbidden to dispose of any of SHA\u2019s assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">By August 9, 1995, when the News article which is the subject of this suit was published, plaintiffs were in the process of purchasing the dealership\u2019s assets from VCI. They claim that the alleged defamatory publication hampered them in this undertaking and otherwise caused them personal and professional harm. They allege further that defendants failed to comply with their request to print a correction of the article and a retraction of the offending portion.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b197-10\">A defamatory statement is one that \u201casserts or implies a statement of fact which is damaging to reputation.\u201d <em>Lutz v. Royal Ins. Co., </em>245 <em>N.J.Super. </em>480, 492, 586 A.2d 278 (App.Div.1991). <em>See also Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7 559, at 156 (1977) (\u201cA communication is defamatory if it tends so to harm the reputation of another as to lower him in the estimation of the community or to deter third persons from associating or dealing with him.\u201d). Whether a statement is defamatory is ordinarily a question of law for the court to determine. <em>Kotlikoff v. The Community News, </em>89 <em>N.J. </em>62, 67, 444 A.2d 1086 (1982). <em>See also Cibenko v. Worth Publishers, Inc., </em>510 <em>F.Supp. </em>761, 764 (D.N.J.1981). The jury decides the question only when the trial court determines that \u201cthe statement is reasonably susceptible to both a defamatory and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>a non-defamatory meaning[.]\u201d <em>Molnar v. The Star-Ledger, </em>193 <em>N.J.Super. </em>12, 18, 471 A.2d 1209 (App.Div.1984). The publication as a whole must be considered, with the alleged defamation weighed in context. <em>Cibenko, supra, </em>510 <em>F.Supp. </em>at 764. The law of defamation must accommodate two conflicting values: the concern for protecting individuals in the \u201c \u2018enjoy[ment of] their reputations unimpaired by false and defamatory attacks,\u2019 \u201d <em>Costello v. Ocean County Observer, </em>136 <em>N.J. </em>594, 606, 643 A.2d 1012 (1994) (quoting <em>Swede v. Passaic Daily News, </em>30 <em>N.J. </em>320, 331, 153 A.2d 36 (1959)), and the often colliding interest of promoting free communication in an open society. <em>Costello, supra, </em>136 <em>N.J. </em>at 606, 643 A.2d 1012 (\u201cPrivileges that restrict recovery for defamation ... are \u2018designed to protect speech in those narrowly defined instances in which the public interest in unrestrained communication outweighs the right of redress.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Fees v. Trow, </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>330, 336, 521 A.2d 824 (1987)). <em>See also Sisler v. Gannett Co., Inc., </em>104 <em>N.J. </em>256, 265, 516 A.2d 1083 (1986) (discussing the court decisions \u201cwhich attempt to pacify the warring interests of free speech and individual reputation\u201d). The key principle in defamation/free expression cases is the \u201cprofound national commitment to the principle that debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open[.]\u201d <em>New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, </em>376 <em>U.S. </em>254, 270, 84 <em>S.Ct. </em>710, 721, 11 <em>L. Ed.2d </em>686, 701 (1964). <em>See also, e.g., Turf Lawnmower Repair, Inc. v.

Sullivan, supra, </em>a public official may not recover damages in a defamation suit \u201crelating to his official conduct unless he proves that the statement was made with \u2018actual malice\u2019 \u2014 that is, with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.\u201d 376 <em>U.S. </em>at 279-280, 84 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 725, 11 <em>L. </em>Ed.2d at 706. This standard was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>extended to apply to public figures in <em>Curtis Publishing Co. v. </em>Butts, <em>388 </em>U.S. <em>130, 87 </em>S.Ct. <em>1975, 18 </em>L. <em>Ed.2d 1094 (1967).</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">The United States Supreme Court has been less definitive in addressing the appropriate standard for application to private persons. Those accustomed to the public eye</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AIU\">usually enjoy significantly greater access to the channels of effective communication and hence have a more realistic opportunity to counteract false statements than private individuals normally enjoy. Private individuals are therefore more vulnerable to injury, and the state interest in protecting them is correspondingly greater.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-7\"><em>[Gertz v.

Sullivan </em>\u201cactual malice\u201d standard on defamation suits brought by private individuals. Thus, with a few caveats, including that presumed or punitive damages may not be recovered without \u201ca showing of knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard for the truth[,]\u201d 418 <em>U.S. </em>at 349, 94 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 3011, 41 <em>L. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number><em>Ed.</em>2d at 810, <em>Gertz </em>left essentially in state hands the development and application of the law governing defamation in respect of private plaintiffs.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-5\">[S]o long as they do not impose liability without fault, the States may define for themselves the appropriate standard of liability for a publisher or broadcaster of defamatory falsehood injurious to a private individual.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-6\">[418 <em>U.S. </em>at 347, 94 <em>S.Ct. </em>at <em>3010, 41 L. Ed.2d </em>at 809 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">In <em>Turf, supra, </em>139 <em>N.J. </em>392, 655 A.2d 417, the New Jersey Supreme Court addressed the questions of whether and when to apply the actual malice standard to private individuals. In doing so, the Court was governed by its view expressed in <em>Sisler, supra, </em>104 <em>N.J. </em>256, 516 A.2d 1083, that New Jersey\u2019s Constitution affords greater protection to free speech than is provided by the Federal Constitution.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-8\">[0]ur decisions, pronounced in the benevolent light of New Jersey\u2019s constitutional commitment to free speech, have stressed the vigor with which New Jersey fosters and nurtures speech on matters of public concern.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AkAY\">[Id. at 271-72, 516 A.2d 1083.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b200-10\">However, although acknowledging that prior cases had imposed the actual malice standard where \u201cbusiness activities ... intrinsically implicated important public interests,\u201d <em>Turf, supra, </em>139 <em>N.J. </em>at 411-12, 655 A.2d 417, the Court drew some lines. The Court noted that sole proprietorships or stores, \u201clike a local \u2018mom and pop\u2019 stationery store, shoemaker, tailor, cleaner, or barber,\u201d were not public figures and their doings were not matters of public concern. <em>Id. </em>at 412, 655 A.2d 417. The same held true for the lawnmower repair business that was the subject of <em>Turf, see id. </em>at 413, 655 A.2d 417 (noting that such a business usually triggers the negligence standard as distinguished from the actual malice standard). Ordinary businesses and their owners were deemed to be private persons, and the heightened burden of the actual malice standard did not apply to them. <em>Id. </em>at 427-28, 655 A.2d 417. Certain \u201cmatters of public concern,\u201d however, such as conduct that \u201cwould constitute a violation of the Consumer Fraud Act,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 427, 655 A.2d 417, as well as activities affecting the health and safety of the citizenry, or involving a highly regulated industry, <em>see id. </em>at 410, 655 A.2d 417 (citing <em>Sisler, supra, </em>104 <em>N.J. </em>256, 516 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>A.2d 1083 and <em>Dairy Stores, Inc. v. Sentinel Publishing Co., </em>104 <em>N.J. </em>125, 516 A.2d 220 (1986)), are sufficient to trigger application of the actual malice standard. <em>Turf, supra, </em>139 <em>N.J. </em>at 416, 426-27, 655 A.2d 417. The criterion for application of that standard to private persons was succinctly stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-6\">The public [has] a legitimate interest in any business charged with criminal fraud, a substantial regulatory violation, or consumer fraud that raises a matter of legitimate public concern. When the media addresses those issues of legitimate and compelling public concern, the actual-malice standard of proof will apply, regardless of the type of business involved.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-7\"><em>[Id. </em>at 413, 655 A.2d 417.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b201-9\">According to the trial court, \u201cthe central issue in this case\u201d was whether or not plaintiffs are public or private figures. Summary judgment was denied to defendants because \u201ca jury could possibly find that plaintiffs do not satisfy the public figure requirement, thus defendants\u2019 privilege defense would be invalid.\u201d The judge explained his denial of the defense\u2019s summary judgment motion as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-10\">Defendants have not presented undisputed evidence that plaintiffs were public figures or that they were limited public figures for the purpose of the article in question. An individual does not become a public figure because of alleged ownership interest in a car dealership or participation in a golf tournament.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-11\">In so ruling, the trial court judge, although correct in his understanding of the <em>Turf </em>standards, misapplied prevailing requirements and misconceived the nature of the ease. It is not for the jury to rule on public/private figure status, since it is settled that this determination is a question of law for the court. <em>Costello v. Ocean County Observer, </em>136 <em>N.J. </em>594, 612, 643 A.2d 1012 (1994); <em>Lawrence v. Bauer Publishing &amp; Printing Ltd., </em>89 <em>N.J. </em>451, 462, 446 A.2d 469, <em>cert. denied, </em>459 <em>U.S. </em>999, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>358, 74 <em>L. </em>Ed.2d 395 (1982). Moreover, defendants do not contend that plaintiffs are public figures. They have conceded the contrary, both in the trial court and on appeal. The trial court judge ignored that concession. It was clearly erroneous for the trial court to have based its ruling on the need to make that determination. Defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>dants have premised their positions upon arguably applicable qualified or conditional common law privileges, rather than on the federal/state constitutional privilege. The issues raised by application of the common law privileges were not addressed by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">The common law has traditionally regarded certain communications privileged in order to accommodate the need of the public for the free flow of information. <em>See Dairy Stores, supra, </em>104 <em>N.J. </em>at 136, 516 A.2d 220. While certain statements are absolutely privileged, \u201ca qualified or conditional privilege has emerged as one of the prime means for the common law to balance the interests in reputation with the publication of information in the public interest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 137, 516 A.2d 220 (citing <em>Restatement (Second) of Tarts, </em>Conditional Privileges, Scope Note preceding \u00a7 593, at 258 (1965)). The common law has been characterized as \u201can alternative, and potentially more stable, framework for analyzing statements about matters of public interest!,]\u201d <em>Dairy Stores, supra, </em>104 <em>N.J. </em>at 139, 516 A.2d 220, in contradistinction to the \u201c\u2018public figure\u2019 device!,] an awkward and uncertain method of determining whether statements about corporations or their products are actionable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 140, 516 A.2d 220.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">The Supreme Court has likewise seen the term \u201cmalice\u201d to be singularly unhelpful in the discussion of the common law privileges, <em>see id. </em>at 151, 516 A.2d 220 (\u201cit can become a pitfall in the underbrush of the common law\u201d). The <em>Restatement </em>reference to \u201cabuse of privilege\u201d has been stressed instead, <em>see ibid, </em>(referencing <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7 599 (1965)). The Court has observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-8\">It is more direct to recognize the legal consequences of the publication of certain statements without recourse to so ambiguous a word with such a checkered past.

Thus, although the common law exonerated one who published a defamation as long as the statement was true, a newspaper in these circumstances could avail itself of the truth defense only if the truth of the underlying defamation were established.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-11\"><em>[Medico, supra, </em>643 <em>F.2(\\ </em>at 137 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-12\">Because the common law rule impinged upon freedom of the press, the fair report privilege developed \u201c[t]o ameliorate the chilling effect on the reporting of newsworthy events\u201d that the republication rule imposed. <em>Ibid. </em>The <em>Restatement </em>defines the privilege as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-13\">The publication of defamatory matter concerning another in a report of an official action or proceeding or of a meeting open to the public that deals with a matter of public concern is privileged if the report is accurate and complete or a fair abridgement of the occurrence reported.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-14\"><em>[Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7 611, at 297 (1977).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b204-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>Comment d of \u00a7 611 then elaborates on the meaning of the term \u201cofficial proceedings\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-5\">The privilege ... extends to the report of any official proceeding, or any action taken by any officer or agency of the government of the United States, or of any State or of any of its subdivisions.

The filing of a report by an officer or agency of the government is an action bringing a reporting of the governmental report within the scope of the privilege.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">Three alternative rationales justify the privilege. The first is based upon an agency theory: a reporter covering an official proceeding serves as an agent for those who could have attended the proceeding to see and hear for themselves. <em>Costello, supra, </em>136 <em>N.J. </em>at 607, 643 A.2d 1012; <em>Medico, supra, </em>643 F.2d at 140-41. \u201cA theory of public supervision also informs the fair report privilege.\u201d <em>Medico, supra, </em>643 F.2d at 141.

The determination is an objective one. <em>Ibid. </em>The standard consists essentially of two tests which must be applied to the alleged defamatory statement: first accuracy, and then fairness.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-8\"><em>Costello, supra, </em>136 <em>N.J. </em>594, 643 A.2d 1012, involved a newspaper write-up by a reporter investigating possible police misconduct. In a report on the general issue gleaned from a perusal of court docum\u00e9nts, one portion of the article described Costello as having strip-searched and fondled a female arrestee. Costello sued for defamation. The Supreme Court analyzed the news <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>article as neither fair nor accurate. It opined that a \u201creasonable reader\u201d would have concluded the allegedly molested female was \u201cactively pursuing [a] harassment claim\u201d against Costello, when in fact no complaint had been filed against him. <em>Id. </em>at 608, 643 A.2d 1012. The document from which the reporter obtained his information was an exhibit in a <em>pro se </em>order to show cause which was unsigned and stamped \u201cdraft.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 601, 643 A.2d 1012. Although at one point the news article indicated that no complaints had been filed against Costello, <em>id. </em>at 604, 643 A.2d 1012,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-6\">a reader who review[ed] the entire article receive[d] conflicting information regarding the status of the matter; the article [was] internally inconsistent, misleading and confusing. The story [gave] the overall impression that litigation against Costello concerning Fesl\u2019s claim [was] pending.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-7\"><em>[Id. </em>at 609, 643 A.2d 1012.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">The Court also viewed the article as \u201cmisleading and unfair\u201d because it omitted \u201csignificant facts,\u201d <em>ibid., </em>including that a court case pending in connection with the incident involved a different arrestee, a male, and a different police officer. The Court also noted that at the time the article was published, Costello was immune from suit by the female arrestee because the statute of limitations had run. <em>Id. </em>at 603, 609, 643 A.2d 1012. Most significantly, however,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-9\">the article, and especially its headline, make Officer Costello the focus of the court proceeding.

The court document lists the owners of Somerset Hills Audi, Inc. as Paul Reynolds, James Sedore and Mayfair Investments, Inc.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">Plaintiffs contend that this statement is false in two respects: 1) that they, Reynolds and Sedore, were named in the court order as 2) owners of the dealership. In fact, the July 31 court order, itself, named only Mayfair and Lardier in connection with SHA. Although plaintiffs acknowledge that the rest of the article was not inaccurate, they argue that, by implication, all of the malfeasance which was in actuality attributable to Lardier and Mayfair, as owners, would have been attributed by News readers to plaintiffs as well. While the article does not directly mention wrongdoing by plaintiffs, \u201c \u2018[t]he sting of an accusation may be more pervasive when made by insinuation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Molnar, supra, </em>193 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 18, 471 A.2d 1209 (quoting <em>Lawrence v. Bauer Publishing &amp; Printing Ltd., </em>176 <em>N.J.Super. </em>378, 389, 423 A.2d 655 (App.Div. 1980), <em>rev\u2019d in part on other grounds and vacated in part on other grounds, </em>89 <em>N.J. </em>451, 446 A.2d 469 (1982)).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-8\">\n<em>The Accuracy Prong</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b206-9\">Valentine, a detective sergeant at the time of the publication of the alleged defamation, was a principal source of information for the News article. At some point after August 1, 1995, when an SHA employee, Christopher Lewis, filed a complaint with Valentine\u2019s office, and August 9, the date of the article, Valentine met with the reporter, Polakiewicz, to discuss the SHA closing. In his deposition testimony, Valentine verified that the August 9 News article was an accurate representation of information he had conveyed. With regard to the identification of the owners of the dealership, the following colloquy ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>Q: Can you tell me what you indicated who the owners were according to the information you had?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-6\">A: Can I explain this, clarify this?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-7\">Q: Sure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-8\">A: I received a complaint from Mr. Lewis, and that they were not being paid by the owners of VCI [sic]. Mr. Lewis had indicated to me when he made his complaint that the owners of VCI [sic] included Mayfair Investment, a gentleman by the name of David Lardier, a Mr. Reynolds and a Mr. Sedore. He produced for me then a document, a court document that was identified or marked ..., to show part of his complaint. When he made the complaint, he produced this to me also.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-9\">Q: This is Mr. Lewis who did this?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-10\">A: Mr. Lewis provided me with that. David Polakiewicz had asked me several questions about who the owners of Somerset Hills Audi, Incorporated were, and I indicated to him, based on the complaint that was made to me by Mr. Lewis, it included those people we previously mentioned, Mr. Sedore, Mr. Reynolds, Mayfair and Mr. Lardier.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-11\">I remember this very clearly. David asked questions, and I remember at that time I didn\u2019t have a lot of firsthand knowledge about who the owners were. David asked me to provide him with a copy of the court document. I didn\u2019t feel that that was appropriate to release that out of my file.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-12\">However, it was a public record and something that he could obtain. So I let him look at that. He was asking me questions about that. I let him review that. He reviewed that for a while and took notes while he was writing from that. With regard to your question on that particular paragraph, I never said that Paul Reynolds or James Sedore were listed in that court document as owners. However, I did tell him that they were mentioned as owners based on the information provided to me by Mr. Lewis.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b207-13\">On cross-examination, Valentine testified that at the time of his initial meeting with Polakiewicz, he had been aware of an article that had appeared in the News on May 31, 1995, on the subject of a golf tournament to which SHA had donated a car. Valentine recalled that the article indicated Reynolds was an owner of SHA, and that Sedore may also have been mentioned to him in that connection by the person who had been in charge of the golf outing. Valentine also recalled that in a conversation with Polakiewiez on August 14, when there was already some concern about a defamation suit by Reynolds and Sedore,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Polakiewicz produced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>a letter from SHA indicating that Sedore and Reynolds were part-owners of the dealership.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">Defendant David Polakiewicz gave a somewhat different version of his contacts with Valentine. He maintained that Valentine would not permit him access to the court documents during the pre-article interview because Valentine apparently thought it was inappropriate to do so. Polakiewicz testified that Valentine essentially made an oral presentation to him and then he, Polakiewicz, asked specific questions of Valentine. The information about the ownership of SHA was given to him during the presentation, with Valentine referring to \u201cthe one court document.\u201d At the time, Valentine had the file on his desk with several papers spread out in front of him.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">Polakiewicz further testified that it was not until after the August 9,1995 story had already appeared in the News that, upon instruction from the executive editor, he went to the courthouse to review the actual documents in Valentine\u2019s file. In going through the file, he came across a letter dated September 12, 1994, from SHA to VCI, mentioning that Reynolds and Sedore were five percent owners.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">According to Polakiewicz, when he wrote the August 9 article, his \u201cknowledge\u201d of the ownership interest of Reynolds and Sedore had come from other sources besides Valentine. The May 31 article about the golf tournament had been brought to his attention by its author, editor Charles Zavalick. Zavalick, in turn, testified that Reynolds had told him in May that he was an owner of SHA, before Zavalick wrote the article about the tournament. There was also a source which Polakiewicz declined to name, an employee of SHA, who had identified Sedore and Reynolds as part-owners of the company to the reporter.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">As part of the sum of information which the parties allege to have been available to Polakiewicz at the time he wrote the article, former SHA service manager Christopher Lewis asserted in a certification that although he communicated with Valentine on August 1, 1995, he had personal knowledge at that time that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>Reynolds and Sedore were not SHA owners, and never indicated to Valentine that they were owners.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">The basic question is one of law to be determined by the court. <em>Kotlikoff, supra, </em>89 <em>N.J. </em>at 67, 444 A.2d 1086. In the light of the facts developed, and viewing the evidential materials as is required on summary judgment, \u201cin the light most favorable to the non-moving party,\u201d <em>Brill v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of America, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>520, 540, 666 A.2d 146 (1995), we evaluate the alleged defamatory article as a substantially accurate and fair report of a matter of legitimate public interest. It is, therefore, as a matter of law, not actionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">The one certain inaccuracy present in the August 9 article is the statement implying that the court order listed Reynolds and Sedore as owners. Manifestly, the court order itself did not contain any such reference; the mention of plaintiffs\u2019 ownership interests was in another document in the court\u2019s case file, an exhibit to a certification. The News article refers to \u201can order in state Superior Court\u201d and says: \u201c[t]he court document lists\u201d plaintiffs as the owners of SHA. Any reader would necessarily infer from the context that the court order was the source of information either of Valentine or of the reporter.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">This is not an error of sufficient consequence for plaintiffs to prevail on the first prong of the test for abuse of the fair report privilege. The privilege applies even if that which is reported is not \u201c\u2018exact in every immaterial detail____ It is enough that it conveys to the persons who read it a substantially correct account of [the contents of an official document.]\u2019 \u201d <em>Costello, supra, </em>136 <em>N.J. </em>at 607, 643 A.2d 1012 (quoting <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7 611 comment f (1976)). <em>See also Medico, supra, </em>643 F.2d at 138 n. 11 (\u201cThe fair report privilege is similar to the truth defense [in defamation cases]. Both make verity the issue, although requiring that a report be fair and accurate may allow the press a somewhat greater margin of error than requiring that its report be true.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-11\">The record discloses that one of the sources for the information which Valentine conveyed to Polakiewicz about the ownership of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>SHA was a document \u2014 according to Valentine, the complaint filed by SHA employee Lewis, though Lewis\u2019s certification states that he knew at the time that Reynolds and Sedore were not owners of SHA, and never indicated to Valentine that they were. Another source of the information was the file of the court proceeding involving VCI, which Valentine referred to but may not have displayed to Polakiewicz. According to Polakiewicz, after the article had been written, he inspected the court\u2019s file which contained a letter referring to Reynolds and Sedore as minority shareholders in SHA. Defendants stress that letter, an exhibit in a certification known to have been filed with the court, which indicates that Reynolds and Sedore were part-owners of SHA. It is not surprising that Polakiewicz, as a reporter, may have had difficulty in distinguishing between a complaint, a letter of intent, a certification, and a court order, although ignorance of this type does not, by itself, serve to annul the reporter\u2019s responsibility to write accurately and fairly. <em>See Costello, supra, </em>136 <em>N.J. </em>at 619, 643 A.2d 1012 (\u201c[J]ournalists are not lawyers by trade. Errors in reports on court proceedings are bound to occur from time to time, and the First Amendment protects those errors as long as they are not recklessly or intentionally made.\u201d). In any event, the difference between the article\u2019s implication that the ownership information came from the court order, and a more accurate statement, instead, that \u201ca\u201d court document, as opposed to \u201cthe\u201d court document, was Valentine\u2019s source, is not of sufficient moment, given the free speech values at stake, to defeat defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-4\">[Newspaper accounts of legislative or other official proceedings must be accorded some degree of liberality. When determining whether an article constitutes \u201ca fair and true\u201d report, the language used therein should not be dissected and analyzed with a lexicographer\u2019s precision. This is so because a newspaper article is, by its very nature, a condensed report of events which must, of necessity, reflect to some degree the subjective viewpoint of its author. Nor should a fair report which is not misleading, composed and phrased in good faith under the exigencies of a publication deadline, be thereafter parsed and dissected on the basis of precise denotative meanings which may literally, although not contextually, be ascribed to the words used.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number><em>[Costello, supra, </em>136 <em>N.J. </em>at 625, 643 A.2d 1012 (O\u2019Hern, J., concurring) (quoting <em>Holy Spirit Ass\u2019n for Unification of World Christianity v. New York Times Co., </em>49 <em>N.Y.2d </em>63, 424 <em>N.Y.S.2d </em>165, 399 N.E.2d 1185, 1187 (1979).)]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-6\"><em>But see Schiavone Constr. Co. v. Time, Inc., </em>847 <em>F.</em>2d 1069, 1089 (3d Cir.1988) (report that intentionally excludes obviously exculpatory information is neither fair nor accurate).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">Both Valentine and Polakiewicz are in essential agreement that Valentine believed Reynolds and Sedore to be part-owners of SHA, and conveyed that information to the reporter verbally. Whether, additionally, Valentine represented to Polakiewicz that the information was confirmed in a court order, a complaint, or a copy of a letter of intent in an exhibit, is not critical in evaluating the essential accuracy of Polakiewicz\u2019s reportage. It is equally inconsequential in the circumstances depicted that the document was referred to in a way which conveyed an impression that it was a court order rather than part of a certification in the court file.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">\n<em>The Fairness Prong</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b211-9\">The fairness prong of the test for abuse of the fair report privilege is also satisfied. \u201cAlthough a reporter is allowed to make factual errors and omissions, the fair report privilege will not protect a story if the errors and omissions mislead readers.\u201d <em>Costello, supra, </em>136 <em>N.J. </em>at 608, 643 A.2d 1012. Plaintiffs, by their own admission, had themselves told customers and fellow employees that they were part owners of SHA. Thus, despite the subsequent failure of Lardier and Mayfair to comply with alleged promises, it was to be expected that the impression remained with the general public \u2014 or such of the public as was interested in the affairs of SHA \u2014 that Reynolds and Sedore had an ownership interest. Plaintiffs were certainly aware of the representations which had been made to Audi; and the fact that they hired an attorney to assert their ownership interest demonstrates that they deemed themselves to be owners. Reynolds apparently had no qualms about being held out as an owner as late as May 31,1995, when the article about the golf tournament appeared.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>Thus, plaintiffs cannot be heard to complain if there were sources of information which substantiated to reporter Polakiewiez that plaintiffs were part-owners of SHA. After plaintiffs, themselves, disseminated the reports of their ownership which they now claim are false, and even retained an attorney to assert the \u201cfalsity\u201d as against Lardier and Mayfair, it is not possible to regard Polakiewicz\u2019s article as the sole, or even the primary, source of any widespread belief that plaintiffs had ownership interests in SHA. If the \u201cfalsity\u201d plaintiffs propagated turned up in print at a time when it did not redound to their advantage, that is not a cause for action against these defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">\n<em>The Common Interest Privilege</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">Closely related, or \u201canalogous,\u201d to the fair report privilege is the qualified privilege for a communication made by a public official in connection with that official\u2019s duties. <em>Molnar, swpra, </em>193 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 20, 471 A.2d 1209.

At issue there was a statement in a newspaper article to the effect that landlord Molnar, who had just been sentenced to six months in jail for noncompliance with property maintenance regulations, had refused to take a lie detector test in connection with a fire of suspicious origin that had occurred at one of his properties.

Although conveying information to the news media might not be a specifically designated duty of the official, the court noted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>\u201c \u2018it is increasingly recognized that if this communication pertains to matters which are within the scope of an official\u2019s responsibilities, such statements should be regarded as being within the \u201couter perimeter\u201d of the official\u2019s \u201cline of duty.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 20, 471 A.2d 1209 (quoting <em>Sinderbrand v. Schuster, </em>170 <em>N.J.Super. </em>506, 509-10, 406 A.2d 1344 (Law Div.1979) (quoting <em>Barr v. Matteo, </em>360 <em>U.S. </em>564, 574-75, 79 <em>S.Ct. </em>1335, 1341, 3 <em>L. </em>Ed.2d 1434 (1959))).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">\n<em>The Burden of Proof</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">Once the applicability of a common law privilege has been established, the burden shifts to the plaintiffs to overcome the privilege by demonstrating that the alleged defamatory matter was published either with knowledge of its inaccuracy or with a reckless disregard for its truth or falsity, <em>Dairy Stores, supra, </em>104 <em>N.J. </em>at 151, 516 A.2d 220, or for an improper purpose, <em>Molnar, supra, </em>193 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 21, 471 A.2d 1209. <em>See also Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7 596, comment a, at 275; \u00a7 600 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-8\">Valentine, whose duty it was to take part in an investigation of the shutdown of SHA, made the presentation which was the principal source of the statement complained of in the Polakiewicz article. Plaintiffs base their argument not only on the essential factual inaccuracy conveyed in the article \u2014 that Reynolds and Sedore were among the owners of SHA \u2014 but also on the fact that the published statement indicated that Valentine\u2019s attribution of an ownership interest derived from a court order, as opposed to a document in the court\u2019s possession. There has been no showing made by plaintiffs of improper purpose. The accuracy/fairness analysis we have conducted with regard to the fair report privilege also indicates there has been no showing that defendants were aware, or should have been aware, at the time the article was published, that Reynolds and Sedore were not owners of SHA.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>V</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">Defendants also assert that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:43-1 grants them a qualified privilege under the circumstances of this case. The statute extends the fair report privilege to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-6\">the publication in any newspaper of official statements issued by police department heads and county prosecutors in investigations in progress or completed by them, and which are accepted in good faith by the publisher of any newspaperf.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-9\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>2A:43-1.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-10\">The defense argues that because Valentine was acting in the role of a subordinate to whom authority was delegated by the Police Chief under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A:14-118c, defendants can claim this privilege in addition to that of fair report and common interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-11\">The statute is of no avail to defendants. The Supreme Court has limited its application \u201conly to statements issued by the heads of the respective departments, and not by subordinates therein,\u201d holding that the purpose of the law was to \u201ccentralize responsibility.\u201d <em>Rogers v. Courier Post Co., </em>2 <em>N.J. </em>393, 403, 66 A.2d 869 (1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-12\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b215-13\">The courts of this State have recognized that First Amendment values are compromised by long and costly litigation in defamation cases. <em>See Kotlikoff, supra, </em>89 <em>N.J. </em>at 67, 444 A.2d 1086 (noting the \u201creal potential for chilling journalistic criticism and comment\u201d); <em>Maressa v. New Jersey Monthly, </em>89 <em>N.J. </em>176, 196, 445 A.2d 376, <em>cert. denied, </em>459 <em>U.S. </em>907, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>211, 74 <em>L.Ed.</em>2d 169 (1982) (\u201c[T]he cost of defending a libel action can itself deter free press.\u201d). For this reason, summary judgment has been held to be a particularly apt vehicle for disposing of defamation suits, and the Supreme Court has urged trial courts not to hesitate to employ summary judgment to expedite such litigation whenever appropriate. <em>Ibid. See also Costello, supra, </em>136 <em>N.J. </em>at 605, 643 A.2d 1012 (\u201cSummary judgment is ... an important tool for disposing of nonmeritorious libel lawsuits.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>The trial court judge prefaced his conclusions with an exposition of the summary judgment standard:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-5\">[M]otions for summary judgment should be granted if there are no genuine issues of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>R. </em>4:46-2; <em>Judson v. Peoples Bank and Trust Co., </em>17 <em>N.J. </em>67, 110 A.2d 24 (1954). It is the movant\u2019s burden to exclude any x-easonable doubt as to the existence of any genuine issue of material fact, all inferences of doubt being dx'awn against the movant and in favor of the opponent. <em>Judson. </em>Determining \u201cwhether thei-e exists a \u2018genuine issue\u2019 of material fact that precludes summary judgment x-equires the motion judge to consider whether the competent evidential materials pi'esented, when viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, ax-e sufficient to percnit a rational factfinder to x\u2019esolve the alleged disputed issue in favor of the non-moving party.\u201d <em>Brill v. Guardian Life Ins. Co., </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>520, 666 A.2d 146 (1995).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">This standard, albeit correctly stated, was misapplied based on the faulty assumption that the case turned upon the question whether plaintiffs might be characterized as public figures. The State\u2019s common law privileges were not addressed by the trial court. We view the case differently. Plaintiffs\u2019 status is not an issue, and defendants are entitled to the conditional benefit of the fair report and common interest privileges. The outcome of the case turns upon whether plaintiffs can discharge their burden of proving abuse of either privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">To overcome a qualified privilege, abuse of the privilege must be shown by clear and convincing evidence, <em>Williams v. Bell Tel. Labs., Inc., </em>132 <em>N.J. </em>109, 121, 623 A.2d 234 (1993) (common interest privilege), a factor not considered by the trial court judge because of the issue which he saw to be dispositive. <em>See also Turf, supra, </em>139 <em>N.J. </em>at 423-24, 655 A.2d 417; <em>Erickson v. Marsh &amp; McLennan Co., </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>539, 565-66, 569 A.2d 793 (1990) (\u201c[I]m-position of a lesser burden of proof would fail to adequately protect the interests underlying the privilege.\u201d).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-8\">An issue of fact is genuine only if, <em>considering the burden of persuasion at trial </em>the evidence submitted by the parties on the motion, together with all legitimate inferences therefrom favoring the non-moving party, would require submission of the issue to the trier of fact.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-9\">[it. 4:46-2(c) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number><em>Brill, supra, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>at 534-35, 666 A.2d 146, itself, stresses that the court must take into account the clear and convincing standard of proof required in determining summary judgment motions in defamation suits.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">Plaintiffs\u2019 brief alleges reckless disregard of the truth on the part of the defendants, and malice was alleged in the original complaint. In oral argument on the summary judgment motion, however, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel acknowledged that the evidence did not support a claim of actual malice, and that plaintiffs were asserting negligence instead. As we have already concluded, the record before us discloses that plaintiffs will not be successful in establishing, by a clear and convincing showing, the qualities of acts or omissions that, in the circumstances, would be adequate to overcome the qualified privileges which defendants are entitled to claim. We therefore hold that defendants must prevail on summary judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">VII</p>\n<p id=\"b217-8\">In view of our determination that the defamation action must be dismissed, there is no need for us to decide whether the trial court\u2019s order for discovery of defendant newspaper\u2019s customer list was overly broad. We note only that issuance of a protective order, <em>see R. </em>4:10-3(g), to preserve the confidentiality of the News\u2019s subscription list (whether viewed solely as a general business interest, or whether weighed additionally with free press values which are necessarily implicated) would have been appropriate, especially since plaintiffs had no objection, and in actuality had agreed to abide by such provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-9\">VIII</p>\n<p id=\"b217-10\">The trial court\u2019s order denying defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment is reversed and the complaint is dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b199-10\"> A public figure may be an individual who \"achieve[s] such pervasive fame or notoriety that he becomes a public figure for all purposes and in all contexts.\" <em>Gertz v.
