We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-11\">\u00b62 We review the following issue on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b160-12\">\u00b63 <em>Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it denied Hamilton\u2019s petition for post-conviction relief without granting him an evidentiary hearing?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b160-13\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b160-14\">\u00b64 The State charged Hamilton on June 23, 2004, with eight counts of felony incest in violation of \u00a7 45-5-507, MCA. A jury convicted Hamilton of all eight counts in April 2005. Joseph Gilligan (Gilligan) represented Hamilton for the majority of the pre-trial and all trial proceedings. Gilligan withdrew as Hamilton\u2019s attorney of record on August 16, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-15\">\u00b65 This Court affirmed Hamilton\u2019s conviction and sentence. <em>State v. Hamilton, </em>2007 MT 223, 339 Mont. 92, 167 P.3d 906. We held that Hamilton\u2019s claims of ineffective assistance of counsel were best suited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>for post-conviction proceedings. <em>See id. </em>at \u00b6\u00b6 23, 28, 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">\u00b66 Hamilton timely filed a petition for post-conviction relief with the District Court on August 12,2008. Hamilton claimed that Gilligan had rendered ineffective assistance of counsel, and requested that the District Court hold an evidentiary hearing. On February 19,2009, the District Court denied Hamilton\u2019s petition and his request for an evidentiary hearing. The District Court dismissed Hamilton\u2019s claims of ineffective assistance of counsel pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 46-21-104(l)(c) and 46-21-104(2), MCA, for failure to make a prima facie showing of entitlement to relief, and pursuant to \u00a7 46-21-201(1), MCA, for failure to state a claim for relief. Hamilton appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">\u00b67 We review a district court\u2019s denial of a petition for post-conviction relief to determine whether the court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous and whether its conclusions of law are correct. <em>Beach v. State, </em>2009 MT 398, \u00b6 14, 353 Mont. 411, 220 P.3d 667 <em>(citing Heath v. State, </em>2009 MT 7, \u00b6 13, 348 Mont. 361, 202 P.3d 118). We review discretionary rulings in post-conviction relief proceedings, including rulings related to whether to hold an evidentiary hearing, for an abuse of discretion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">\u00b68 <em>Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it denied Hamilton\u2019s petition for post-conviction relief without granting him an evidentiary hearing?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b161-9\">\u00b69 Hamilton argues that the District Court abused its discretion when it denied his petition for post-conviction relief without holding an evidentiary hearing. Hamilton contends that the District Court accepted Gilligan\u2019s representations \u201cwithout any critical review\u201d of the record, and that the court should not have found that Gilligan\u2019s affidavit was more credible than Hamilton\u2019s. Hamilton maintains that he deserved an evidentiary hearing on his petition. The State argues that the District Court properly dismissed Hamilton\u2019s petition without holding an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-10\">\u00b610 A petition requesting post-conviction relief must show, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the facts justify the relief. <em>Heath, </em>\u00b6 16. A petition for post-conviction relief must \u201cidentify all facts supporting the grounds for relief set forth in the petition and have attached affidavits, records, or other evidence establishing the existence of those facts.\u201d Section 46-21-104(l)(c), MCA. \u201cMere conclusory allegations are insufficient to support the petition.\u201d <em>Beach, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>\u00b6 16. A court may dismiss a petition for post-conviction relief without holding an evidentiary hearing if the petition fails to satisfy the procedural threshold set forth in \u00a7 46-21-104(l)(c), MCA. <em>Heath, </em>\u00b6 16 (citing <em>Herman v. State, </em>2006 MT 7, \u00b6 15, 330 Mont. 267, 127 P.3d 422).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">\u00b611 In addition, a district court may dismiss a petition for post-conviction relief without ordering a response if the petition, files, and records \u201cconclusively show that the petitioner is not entitled to relief.\u201d Section 46-21-201(l)(a), MCA. Alternatively, the court may order a response and, after reviewing the response, \u201cdismiss the petition as a matter of law for failure to state a claim for relief or it may proceed to determine the issue.\u201d Section 46-21-201(l)(a), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">\u00b612 This Court applies the two-prong test from <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052 (1984), in assessing claims of inadequate assistance of counsel. <em>See e.g. Dawson v. State, </em>2000 MT 219, \u00b6 20, 301 Mont. 135, 10 P.3d 49. The defendant must show that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense and deprived the defendant of a fair trial. <em>See e.g. State v. Hendricks, </em>2003 MT 223, \u00b6 6, 317 Mont. 177, 75 P.3d 1268; <em>Dawson, </em>\u00b6 20. With respect to the first prong, the question that \u201cmust be answered is whether counsel\u2019s conduct fell below an objective standard of reasonableness measured under prevailing professional norms and in light of the surrounding circumstances.\u201d <em>Whitlow v. State, </em>2008 MT 140, \u00b6 20, 343 Mont. 90, 183 P.3d 861. We stated in <em>Whitlow </em>that \u201c[t]he strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance and was based on sound trial strategy still remains.\u201d <em>Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 21; <em>see also Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 689, 104 S. Ct. at 2065. This presumption \u201clikewise undergirds the long-standing appellate standard that a petitioner seeking to reverse a district court\u2019s denial of a petition for postconviction relief based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel bears \u2018a heavy burden.\u2019 \u201d <em>Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 21 (quoting <em>Brown v. State, </em>277 Mont. 430, 434, 922 P.2d 1146, 1148 (1996)). Under the second prong, the defendant bears the burden of establishing prejudice by demonstrating that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, there is a reasonable probability that the result would have been different. <em>State v. Godfrey, </em>2009 MT 60, \u00b6 14, 349 Mont. 335, 203 P.3d 834.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">\u00b613 Hamilton alleges five separate instances of ineffective assistance by Gilligan. We address each in turn. With respect to each claim, we consider whether Hamilton\u2019s petition failed to satisfy the procedural threshold set forth in \u00a7 46-21-104(l)(c), MCA (stating that the petition for post-conviction relief must \u201cidentify all facts supporting the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>grounds for relief set forth in the petition and have attached affidavits, records, or other evidence establishing the existence of those facts\u201d) and, thus, whether the District Court abused its discretion by failing to hold an evidentiary hearing. We then consider whether the District Court erred by dismissing the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\">\u00b6 14 Hamilton claims that Gilligan failed to adequately investigate and use information that Hamilton had provided to impeach the credibility of the victim and her mother. Specifically, Hamilton maintained that the victim and her mother had made false stalking allegations against Hamilton, and that Gilligan had failed to investigate further. Hamilton also told Gilligan that Hamilton\u2019s ex-wife came from a family with a long history of sexual misconduct. Lastly, Hamilton provided Gilligan with time cards \u201cthat would have impeached the time line of abuse allegations made by the alleged victim,\u201d but claims that Gilligan failed use them to impeach the victim\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">\u00b615 Gilligan responded to Hamilton\u2019s allegations by stating that he had contacted the witnesses provided by Hamilton. He found that much of the information provided by Hamilton was either irrelevant or inadmissible. With respect to Hamilton\u2019s time cards, Gilligan stated that he could not match the records with the alleged dates and times of the offenses. Lastly, Gilligan explained that he had elected not to attack the credibility of the victim and her mother because Hamilton had made \u201cnumerous admissions of having sexual contact\u201d with the victim, and these admissions were videotaped during a police interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">\u00b616 Although Hamilton provided Gilligan with information that he subjectively believed would impeach the credibility of the victim and her mother, Hamilton\u2019s petition fails to show that the information would have been admissible and effective. The petition fails to make a prima facie showing of entitlement to relief pursuant to \u00a7 46-21-104(l)(c), MCA. Because Hamilton\u2019s petition with respect to this claim does not satisfy the procedural threshold set forth in \u00a7 46-21-104(l)(c), MCA, the District Court did not abuse its discretion by dismissing Hamilton\u2019s claim without holding an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">\u00b617 Hamilton has also failed to show that his counsel\u2019s performance was constitutionally deficient or prejudicial in any way; thus, his petition fails to state a claim for relief on this ground. We conclude that the District Court did not err when it dismissed Hamilton\u2019s claims that Gilligan had failed to investigate and impeach the credibility of the victim and her mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">\u00b618 Hamilton next argues that Gilligan\u2019s failure to obtain a defense medical expert to conduct a second physical examination on the victim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>for defense purposes constituted ineffective assistance. Hamilton stated that he had told Gilligan that he had the funds to pay for the expert. Hamilton asked Gilligan to obtain another expert because the victim had had previous examinations for abuse. According to Hamilton, Gilligan told him that the first examination conducted by the State\u2019s expert was \u201cgood enough.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">\u00b619 Hamilton\u2019s petition with respect to this claim does not show that Gilligan\u2019s decision was deficient or prejudicial. Even if Gilligan did tell Hamilton that the State\u2019s expert was \u201cgood enough,\u201d this does not show or support a reasonable inference that Gilligan\u2019s decision was deficient or prejudicial. Hamilton has not made a prima facie showing that he is entitled to relief; thus, the District Court did not abuse its discretion in failing to hold an evidentiary hearing with respect to this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"AH\">\u00b620 Gilligan explained in his affidavit that he had elected not to hire an expert because the physician for the State testified that there was no sign of penetration or other indicators of abuse. Gilligan stated that \u201cI felt to have this evidence, or lack thereof, coming from a prosecution witness would better serve our case than call our own expert who would have the same opinion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">\u00b621 For his part, Hamilton has not set forth evidence that overcomes the strong presumption that Gilligan\u2019s conduct fell within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance. <em>See Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 21. We conclude that Hamilton has failed to state a claim for relief, and that the District Court did not err in dismissing this claim pursuant to \u00a7 46-21-201(l)(a), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">\u00b622 Gilligan told the jury during his opening statement that Hamilton would testify. Hamilton ultimately decided not to testify. Hamilton now claims that Gilligan\u2019s statement to the jury that Hamilton would testify constituted an unfulfilled promise, and that this constituted ineffective assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">\u00b623 The District Court observed that Hamilton\u2019s petition \u201cdoes not state or show how or why the decision not to call Hamilton was deficient or prejudicial in light of the State\u2019s evidence and the prospect of subjecting Hamilton to cross-examination.\u201d We agree. Hamilton has not made a prima facie showing that he is entitled to relief. The District Court did not abuse its discretion in failing to hold an evidentiary hearing with respect to this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">\u00b624 The record also reflects that Gilligan had prepared Hamilton to testify. He stated that \u201cwe went over his proposed testimony including the questions he would be asked on cross-examination emphasizing questions regarding the statements he made to the police and how he could respond.\u201d After the first day of trial, however, Hamilton told <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>Gilligan that he did not think he wanted to testify because \u201c[i]t wouldn\u2019t do any good.\u201d Gilligan addressed Hamilton\u2019s decision not to testify by drafting and using a jury instruction that \u201ctold the jury they could not draw any inference or conclusion based upon his failure to testify.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\">\u00b625 Hamilton has failed to show how Gilligan\u2019s performance was deficient or prejudicial in light of the damaging admissions Hamilton had made during the police interview and in light of Hamilton\u2019s decision not to testify. We conclude that, based on a careful reading of the record, Hamilton has failed to state a claim for relief. The District Court did not err in dismissing his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">\u00b626  Hamilton next maintains that Gilligan was ineffective because he allowed an investigating officer to testify about interview techniques, the nature and purpose of the techniques employed, and the officer\u2019s observations of Hamilton\u2019s demeanor during interviews. Hamilton\u2019s petition, however, does not explain why Gilligan\u2019s failure to object to the admission of the evidence was deficient or prejudicial. Hamilton\u2019s petition fails to satisfy the procedural threshold set forth in \u00a7 46-21-104(l)(c), MCA. The District Court did not abuse its discretion by dismissing Hamilton\u2019s claim without first holding an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">\u00b627  Gilligan stated with respect to the officer\u2019s testimony that the State \u201chad laid a proper foundation\u201d for the testimony and that \u201c[t]o object and dispute his ability to know signs of deception would have called undue attention to the confession which was already damaging enough.\u201d The District Court found Gilligan\u2019s explanation \u201cpatently reasonable,\u201d and we agree. Hamilton has failed to show that Gilligan\u2019s performance was deficient. We conclude that the District Court did not err in dismissing Hamilton\u2019s claim that Gilligan was ineffective because he allowed an investigating officer to testify about interview techniques.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">\u00b628 Hamilton lastly claims that Gilligan rendered ineffective assistance of counsel because Gilligan had drug and alcohol problems during the time he was representing Hamilton, that these problems adversely affected Gilligan\u2019s relationship with Hamilton, and that they adversely impacted Gilligan\u2019s pre-trial and trial performance. Hamilton argues that Gilligan\u2019s drug and alcohol problems created a conflict of interest. Specifically, Hamilton maintains that \u201c[t]his can be seen during his closing argument when he told the jury that they probably hate Hamilton.\u201d Hamilton further contends that although \u201cdefense attorneys are not prohibited from saying negative things <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>about their clients,\u201d Gilligan\u2019s \u201capproach in this emotionally charged case cannot be considered a sound tactical decision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">\u00b629  We observe that Hamilton\u2019s petition does not show how Gilligan\u2019s alleged drug and alcohol problems actually caused any deficient performance. The District Court stated that \u201c[t]hese facts do nothing more than establish a basis for speculative, derogatory innuendo.\u201d We agree. Hamilton\u2019s petition also failed to explain how Gilligan\u2019s statement during his closing argument was constitutionally deficient or prejudicial. We conclude that Hamilton\u2019s petition fails to satisfy the procedural threshold set forth in \u00a7 46-21-104(l)(c), MCA. The District Court did not abuse its discretion by dismissing Hamilton\u2019s claim without first holding an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">\u00b630 Gilligan categorically stated that \u201c[a]t no time-whether in the meetings, while investigating the case, in court proceedings or any other time pertinent to this case-was the undersigned imbibing alcohol or had been drinking alcohol prior to said events.\u201d Gilligan\u2019s affidavit also explained that his statements during closing argument stemmed from the fact that \u201c[t]his was an obviously emotional case based upon the subject matter involved which was eight counts of incest over a period of eight years.\u201d He stated that his statements during closing argument \u201cwere aimed at having the jury remove that emotion from their deliberations and, instead, concentrate on the testimony presented to dispute that this activity took place over that length of time and in the specific years alleged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">\u00b631  We conclude that Hamilton has failed to overcome the strong presumption that Gilligan\u2019s actions constituted trial strategy and were within the broad scope of reasonable professional conduct. <em>See Hendricks, </em>\u00b6 7. With respect to Gilligan\u2019s alleged drug and alcohol problems, the District Court concluded that \u201c[a]t the bottom line, irrespective of the self-serving derogatory innuendo, [Hamilton] fails to show that counsel\u2019s strategy and performance were the result of anything other than reasonable judgment calls, well-within the constitutionally permissible range of professional conduct expected of defense counsel in Montana.\u201d We agree. The District Court did not err in dismissing Hamilton\u2019s claim that Gilligan generally rendered deficient performance due to alleged drug and alcohol problems and that such alleged problems caused Gilligan to render deficient performance during his closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">\u00b632  We conclude that Hamilton\u2019s petition for post-conviction relief fails to satisfy the procedural threshold set forth in \u00a7 46-21-104(l)(c), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>MCA. The District Court did not abuse its discretion when it dismissed Hamilton\u2019s petition without first conducting an evidentiary hearing. We also conclude that Hamilton\u2019s claims of ineffective assistance of counsel all failed to state claims for relief. The District Court did not err by dismissing Hamilton\u2019s petition for post-conviction relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\">\u00b633 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b167-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES LEAPHART, NELSON and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
