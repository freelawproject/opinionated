We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"Ajo\">\u00b62 We review on appeal whether the Youth Court properly denied S.M.S.\u2019s motion to suppress his confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">\u00b63 R.S., S.M.S.\u2019s father, brought S.M.S. to the Cascade County Sheriffs Office on October 12, 2007, to register S.M.S. as a sex offender. S.M.S. was 16 years old at the time. While at the Sheriffs Office, R.S. told Sergeant Scott Van Dyken that he had caught S.M.S. in the bedroom of S.S., S.M.S.\u2019s six year old sister, a few days earlier. R. S. told Sergeant Van Dyken that he did not think anything had happened because S.M.S. had been in S.S.\u2019s room only for a very short time. Sergeant Van Dyken chose to refer the incident to Deputy Brad Robertson for investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-9\">\u00b64 Deputy Robertson drove to S.M.S.\u2019s home later that day. He found S. M.S. there alone. Deputy Robertson explained to S.M.S.\u2019s neighbor that he was taking S.M.S. in for questioning. Deputy Robertson did not inform S.M.S. that he was investigating S.M.S. for a possible sex crime. The neighbor told Deputy Robertson that S.M.S.\u2019s parents were at work. Deputy Robertson made three attempts to call S.M.S.\u2019s parents, but he could not reach them. He did not leave messages for S.M.S.\u2019s parents. Deputy Robertson gave his business card to the neighbor and requested that S.M.S.\u2019s parents contact him if they returned home.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-11\">\u00b65 Deputy Robertson drove S.M.S. to the Sheriffs Office where he placed S.M.S. in an interview room. During the video-taped interview, Deputy Robertson first read S.M.S. his <em>Miranda </em>rights. Deputy Robertson stopped after reading each right to ask S.M.S. if he understood it. S.M.S. nodded or replied each time that he understood. Deputy Robertson showed S.M.S. the waiver form after reading S.M.S. his rights. Deputy Robertson asked S.M.S. if he would agree to sign the waiver of his rights. S.M.S. agreed and signed the waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-12\">\u00b66 Deputy Robertson interviewed S.M.S. about his family background and friends before he turned the conversation to what happened on October 7, 2007. S.M.S. divulged that he went into the bedroom of S.S. and started thinking about \u201cit.\u201d When asked whether \u201cit\u201d meant sex, S.M.S. said yes. S.M.S. admitted that he became aroused, closed S.S.\u2019s door, and approached her. S.M.S. first told <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>Deputy Robertson he did not touch S.S., but S.M.S. later conceded that he had touched S.S.\u2019s vagina with his hands. S.M.S. demonstrated for Deputy Robertson how he had touched S.S.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">\u00b67 Deputy Robertson offered S.M.S. the choice to get a drink of water or to use the bathroom approximately half-way through the 80-minute interview. S.M.S. elected to use the bathroom. Deputy Robertson stopped the interview to allow S.M.S. to use the bathroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">\u00b68 S.M.S. admitted after the interview had re-commenced that he had touched both S.S. and his younger brother several years earlier. S.M.S. further acknowledged to Deputy Robertson that he had gone through treatment in Georgia for previously having sexual contact with a six year old. Deputy Robertson inquired whether S.M.S. understood that he would go through similar treatment in Montana and whether he knew there were laws against his conduct. S.M.S. answered affirmatively.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">\u00b69 The State filed a motion for leave to file a youth court petition on October 17, 2007. The Youth Court granted the State leave to file its petition charging S.M.S. with felony sexual assault. The Youth Court sent S.M.S. a summons for an initial appearance on October 30,2007. The Youth Court ordered S.M.S. to undergo a psychosexual evaluation at the conclusion of his initial appearance. Dr. Donna May Zook evaluated S.M.S. and filed her report with the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">\u00b610 S.M.S. subsequently filed a motion to suppress his confession. He argued that his \u201csevere cognitive delay\u201d rendered involuntary both his waiver of his <em>Miranda </em>rights and his confession. Four separate psychological evaluations had revealed that S.M.S. possesses a very low level of intellectual functioning, that he needs special education classes, and that he suffers from fetal alcohol syndrome. S.M.S. also suffers from post-traumatic stress syndrome and has Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. S.M.S. also likely had been sexually abused as a child.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-8\">\u00b611 The Youth Court held a hearing on S.M.S.\u2019s motion. Deputy Robertson testified about his interview with S.M.S. Dr. Michael Butz testified that S.M.S. has an IQ of 62 and only has the comprehension ability of a three to five year old. Dr. Butz did not believe that S.M.S. was capable of understanding his <em>Miranda </em>rights or to what he was confessing.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-9\">\u00b612 The State presented testimony of Dr. Zook. Dr. Zook testified that her evaluation of S.M.S. revealed him to be competent to stand trial. She testified that he understood his <em>Miranda </em>rights and that he has an IQ of 70. Dr. Zook testified further that she believed S.M.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>intentionally had manipulated the tests. She testified that the IQ test results significantly had underestimated S.M.S.\u2019s abilities. Dr. Zook believed that S.M.S. knew that if he scored lower he would receive treatment rather than be incarcerated in a youth facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\">\u00b613 The court denied S.M.S.\u2019s motion to suppress. The court found that S.M.S. had made a knowing and voluntary waiver of his <em>Miranda </em>rights and that his confession had been voluntary. S.M.S. eventually pled true to felony sexual assault. He preserved for appeal the challenge to his confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">\u00b614 We engage in a twofold review of a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress. <em>State v. Jones, </em>2006 MT 209, \u00b6 17, 333 Mont. 294, 142 P.3d 851. We initially review the court\u2019s findings of fact to determine whether they are clearly erroneous. <em>Jones, </em>\u00b6 17. We then engage in a plenary review of the conclusions of law to determine whether the district court correctly interpreted the law. <em>Jones, </em>\u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">\u00b615 S.M.S. argues that Deputy Robertson had subjected him to a custodial interrogation and thereby had triggered <em>Miranda. </em>S.M.S. further contends that his \u201csevere cognitive delay\u201d and inability to appreciate the nature of the custodial interrogation had caused him to involuntarily waive his <em>Miranda </em>rights. The State may not use confessions or admissions obtained through \u201ccustodial interrogation\u201d without first providing proper <em>Miranda </em>warnings. <em>State v. Honey, </em>2005 MT 107, \u00b6 18, 327 Mont. 49, 112 P.3d 983. An officer must obtain a valid waiver of <em>Miranda </em>rights before custodial questioning. <em>State v. Morrisey, </em>2009 MT 201, \u00b6 28, 351 Mont. 144, 214 P.3d 708.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-9\">\u00b616 A suspect is \u201cin custody\u201d for <em>Miranda </em>purposes when he has been \u201cdeprived of his freedom of action in any significant way\u201d where a reasonable person would not feel free to leave. <em>State v. Reavley, </em>2003 MT 298, \u00b6\u00b6 18-19, 318 Mont. 150, 79 P.3d 270. Deputy Robertson recognized that he was taking S.M.S. into custody when he interviewed him. Deputy Robertson transported S.M.S. to the Sheriffs Office where he placed S.M.S. in an interview room. S.M.S. reasonably believed that he was not free to leave. Deputy Robertson detained S.M.S. for over an hour and then arrested him at the conclusion of the interview. Deputy Robertson took his time explaining S.M.S.\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>rights to make sure that S.M.S. understood each one before obtaining a signed waiver from S.M.S. Deputy Robertson did not begin <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>to interrogate S.M.S. until after obtaining a waiver from S.M.S.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">\u00b617  Section 41-5-331(2)(a), MCA, provides that as a 16 year old S.M.S. could make an effective waiver of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. The Youth Court noted in its order that S.M.S. was of valid age to waive his rights on his own. The court further weighed the conflicting testimony of Dr. Butz and Dr. Zook to determine that S.M.S. had understood his <em>Miranda </em>rights and possessed the ability to make a knowing and intelligent waiver of these rights. Our review of the interrogation video leads us to determine that the interrogation had been custodial. We further conclude, however, that Deputy Robertson had been conscientious in explaining the <em>Miranda </em>warning to S.M.S. and that S.M.S. had understood and validly had waived those rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">\u00b618 S.M.S. also argues that his confession had been involuntary. Section 46-13-301(1), MCA, permits a defendant to move to suppress a confession if it has been given involuntarily. The specific question of whether a defendant has given a voluntary confession \u201cis largely a factual determination that is within the discretion of the district court.\u201d <em>State v. Hill, </em>2000 MT 308, \u00b6 37, 320 Mont. 415, 14 P.3d 1237.</p>\n<p id=\"ANW\">\u00b619 A court must examine the totality of the circumstances. <em>Morrisey, </em>\u00b6 26. These circumstances encompass both the characteristics of the individual and the details of the interrogation. <em>Morrisey, </em>\u00b6 26. The totality of the circumstances includes the defendant\u2019s age, experience, education level, and the defendant\u2019s prior experience with the criminal justice system and police interrogation. <em>Jones, </em>\u00b6 21. The court also must consider whether the police advised the accused of his <em>Miranda </em>rights and whether the police used impermissible practices to extract incriminating statements. <em>Jones, </em>\u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">\u00b620 S.M.S. met the age requirements of \u00a7 41-5-331(2)(a), MCA, for providing a valid waiver without his parents or counsel present. S.M.S.\u2019s education level and cognitive abilities raise questions as to whether S.M.S. understood the gravity of the circumstances and his confession. Dr. Butz and Dr. Zook provided conflicting testimony regarding S.M.S.\u2019s cognitive abilities. The Youth Court sat in the best position to evaluate the competing testimony along with the videotape of the interview to determine whether S.M.S. had confessed voluntarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">\u00b621 Our review of the interrogation reveals that Deputy Robertson took appropriate care in explaining the <em>Miranda </em>warning to S.M.S. Deputy Robertson remained polite and respectful throughout the interview. He engaged in no impermissible practices in seeking to extract a confession from S.M.S. S.M.S. also had prior experience with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>the criminal justice system and police interrogation from an earlier sexual offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\">\u00b622  We cannot determine that the Youth Court\u2019s findings of fact were clearly erroneous based upon a totality of the circumstances. We further determine that the Youth Court correctly applied the law to these facts and its conclusions of law were correct.
