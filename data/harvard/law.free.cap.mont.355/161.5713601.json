The District Court further granted Riehl\u2019s motion for summary judgment and concluded that the arbitration provision was invalid and unenforceable. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b188-8\">\u00b62 In 2005, Shirley Yanuski was suffering from a form of dementia which significantly impaired her ability to care for herself and competently manage her own affairs. Her daughter, Riehl, became Yanuski\u2019s personal representative. In September 2007, Riehl moved her mother into an establishment in Great Falls, Montana, known as \u201cMurphy\u2019s Elderly Guesthouse\u201d (Guesthouse). Ultimately, Yanuski was unable to reside there because the Guesthouse could not provide for her special needs.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-9\">\u00b63 Riehl and her sister looked into other placement options for their mother in Great Falls which would be able to provide the specialized assisted living care which she required, including a facility known as the \u201cBeehive.\u201d They ultimately determined that Cambridge Court would best serve their mother, and moved her into the Cambridge Court Memory Care Unit on or about September 25, 2007. Yanuski was transferred from the Guesthouse directly to the Cambridge Court facility. According to Riehl, Yanuski did not want to move to Cambridge Court and objected to her placement there. At the time Yanuski was transferred, Riehl did not execute an admission agreement with Cambridge Court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b188-10\">\u00b64 Shannon Freeman (Freeman) was the interim administrator for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>Cambridge Court at the time. Approximately 3 days after Yanuski was admitted, Freeman met with Riehl to execute a care and admission agreement on behalf of Yanuski. The meeting lasted approximately 20 to 30 minutes. At that time, Freeman and Riehl discussed the costs of placement at Cambridge Court\u2019s facility. Freeman also went over the terms of a typewritten, 13-page standard contract entitled \u201cMemory Care Admission Agreement\u201d (Agreement), which was customarily used by Cambridge Court for admission into the Memory Care Unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">\u00b65 Several portions of the Agreement are relevant to the instant appeal. For instance, the Agreement contains the following two provisions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-5\">[Section] 6.12 Legal rights. Nothing in this agreement shall construe any limit of Resident\u2019s or Owner\u2019s inalienable legal rights.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-6\">[Section] 8.9 Governing law. The laws of the State of Oregon, subject to Montana law regarding a licensed Assisted Living Facility, and the Federal Arbitration Act regarding dispute resolution, govern this agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">\u00b66 Immediately following this provision is Section 8.10, entitled \u201cDispute Resolution.\u201d Section 8.10 is 6 paragraphs in length and, unlike the other provisions of the Agreement, is entirely in bold. This provision explicitly states that the parties to the Agreement will resolve \u201cany legal dispute, controversy, demand or claim ... arising out of, or relating to\u201d the Agreement through \u201cBinding Arbitration.\u201d The phrase \u201cbinding arbitration\u201d is itself bolded and underlined so as to stand out from the rest of the text. Furthermore, the fourth paragraph of Section 8.10 states that the parties to the Agreement \u201cunderstand and acknowledge that, by entering into this binding arbitration agreement, they are giving up and waiving their right to have claims decided in a court of law before a judge and a jury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">\u00b67 At the hearing in the District Court, Freeman testified about her discussion of the terms of the Agreement with Riehl. Freeman testified that she did not specifically go over every provision of the Agreement with Riehl. Freeman generally advised Riehl that the Agreement contained a binding arbitration provision to resolve disputes arising from the Agreement. During direct examination, Freeman testified as follows concerning her routine practice in explaining Section 8.10 to a prospective resident:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-9\">Q. You advised [a prospective resident], as your routine practice, you paraphrased what was in that paragraph. If I was a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>prospective resident or a legal representative, what would it have been your practice to tell them about that particular section regarding arbitration?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-4\">A. Typically, when I did approach that section, I would let the family members and the prospective resident know that if anything needed to be decided legally, at some point in time, that the company had a section on binding arbitration. And that that\u2019s the way that they would prefer to see things go forth, if anything needed to be decided.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">\u00b68 On cross-examination, Riehl\u2019s counsel followed up with Freeman on this portion of her testimony.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-6\">Q. [Y]ou said something on direct that I wanted to follow up briefly and then this will be the end, I\u2019ll finish.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-7\">I believe you had indicated that in the section about arbitration in [the Agreement], the Arbitration Provision 8.10, that you explained it [to] the residents that arbitration is how the company would prefer to see things go if there was a dispute down the road; was that you testimony?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-8\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-9\">Q. So, you wouldn\u2019t even explain it that the resident had no choice that arbitration was going to be mandatory. You explained that the company\u2019s preference was that arbitration is how they wanted to see things handled?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-10\">A. Yes, that is how I was under the impression, when I had started wanting to go over this, that that\u2019s how it was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-11\">Q. So, in none of the meetings, and specifically, certainly not with Ms. Riehl, did you explain to the resident that, in signing the admission agreement, the resident was waiving their constitutional right to a jury trial; you didn\u2019t explain that to them?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-12\">A. No, I did not because I was not aware of that at the time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-13\">THE COURT: Because why?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-14\">THE WITNESS: I was not aware of that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b190-15\">\u00b69 On February 13,2008, Yanuski died at Cambridge Court\u2019s facility. Riehl alleged that Yanuski\u2019s death was due acts of negligence by Cambridge Court. On July 18, 2008, Riehl filed a negligence suit against the defendants. Riehl also specifically sought a declaratory judgment that the dispute resolution provision of the Agreement was unenforceable and invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-16\">\u00b610 Cambridge Court subsequently filed a motion to compel arbitration. Riehl resisted the motion to compel and sought summary judgment on her declaratory judgment action regarding the validity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>and enforceability of the arbitration provision. A hearing on the motion to compel and motion for summary judgment was held before the District Court on May 26, 2009.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At the conclusion of the hearing, the District Court denied Cambridge Court\u2019s motion to compel and granted Riehl\u2019s summary judgment motion from the bench, holding that the arbitration provision was invalid and unenforceable. In its oral findings, the District Court determined that Freeman did not discuss with Riehl the fact that Section 8.10 constituted a waiver of the right to a jury trial, and did not herself understand that it was such a waiver. Instead, Freeman thought that arbitration was simply a preferred method of dispute resolution. The District Court also found that the arbitration provision was not itself subject to negotiation, and was presented to Riehl as part of a \u201ctake it or leave it\u201d contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">\u00b611 In its conclusions of law, the District Court considered whether the arbitration provision was enforceable under <em>Kortum-Managhan v. Herbergers NBGL, </em>2009 MT 79, 349 Mont. 475, 204 P.3d 693. The District Court noted that the threshold inquiry in considering a motion to compel arbitration is whether the parties agreed to arbitrate, and that the existence of an agreement to arbitrate is analyzed in accordance with principles of contract formation under Montana law. <em>Kortum-Managhan, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 15-17. The District Court noted that a valid contract must contain the following four elements: (1) identifiable parties capable of contracting; (2) their consent; (3) a lawful object; and (4) consideration. <em>Kortum-Managhan, </em>\u00b6 18. In this regard, the District Court observed that in order for consent to be established under Montana law, there must be \u201cmutual assent\u201d or a \u201cmeeting of the minds\u201d on all essential terms of the contract, and that there must be a valid offer and acceptance in order to effectuate a contract. <em>See Kortum-Managhan, </em>\u00b6 18 (quoting <em>Keesun Partners v. Ferdig Oil Co., Inc., </em>249 Mont. 331, 337, 816 P.2d 417, 421 (1991)).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">\u00b612 The District Court further observed that a contract of adhesion will not be enforced against a weaker party if the terms of the contract are not within the reasonable expectations of the party, or they are within the reasonable expectations of the party, but either unduly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>oppressive, unconscionable, or against public policy. <em>See Kortum-Managhan, </em>\u00b6 23 (citing <em>Zigrang v. U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray, Inc., </em>2005 MT 282, \u00b6 13, 329 Mont. 239, 123 P.3d 237). A contract of adhesion is said to arise \u201cwhen a party possessing superior bargaining power presents a standardized form of agreement to a party whose choice remains either to accept or reject the contract without the opportunity to negotiate its terms.\u201d <em>Zigrang, </em>\u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">\u00b613 Additionally, the District Court noted that in order for a party to consent to arbitration, she must knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waive her fundamental rights of access to the courts and a jury trial under the Montana Constitution. <em>See Kortum-Managhan, </em>\u00b6 26 <em>(citing Kloss v. Edward D. Jones &amp; Co., </em>2002 MT 129, \u00b6\u00b6 48 n.1, 64, 310 Mont. 123, 54 P.3d 1, <em>cert denied, </em>538 U.S. 956, 123 S. Ct. 1633 (2003) (Nelson, Cotter, Leaphart &amp; Trieweiler, J.J., specially concurring)). The District Court considered whether Riehl had executed a valid waiver of these rights under the 10-factor test discussed in <em>Kortum-Managhan, </em>and determined that the factors weighed against the finding of a valid waiver. <em>See Kortum-Managhan, </em>\u00b6 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">\u00b614 Based on this analysis, the District Court drew two dispositive conclusions. First, it concluded that the Agreement was a contract of adhesion, and that the binding arbitration provision was beyond the objective and subjective expectations of Riehl. Consequently, the District Court determined the arbitration provision was unconscionable and unenforceable. Second, the District Court independently concluded that Riehl did not knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waive her fundamental rights to access to the courts and a jury trial. Because there was not a valid waiver of these rights, the District Court concluded there was no mutual consent between the parties to agree to binding arbitration and the arbitration provision was not valid and enforceable as a matter of contract law. The District Court summarized its pronouncement from the bench in a written order date June 3, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">\u00b615 Cambridge Court now appeals from the decision of the District Court. We state the issue presented by Cambridge Court as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"A8h\">\u00b616 <em>Did the District Court err in concluding that the arbitration provision in this case was invalid and unenforceable?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">\u00b617 We review de novo a district court\u2019s disposition of a motion to compel arbitration. <em>Woodruff v. Bretz, Inc., </em>2009 MT 329, \u00b6 5, 353 Mont. 6, 218 P.3d <em>486; Howard Elec. and Mechanical Co., Inc. v. Frank </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number><em>Briscoe Co., Inc., </em>754 F.2d 847, 849 (9th Cir. 1985). We also review de novo a district court\u2019s decision granting summary judgment. <em>Rich v. Ellingson, </em>2007 MT 346, \u00b6 12, 340 Mont. 285, 174 P.3d 491. A district court\u2019s conclusions of law in both of these contexts are reviewed for correctness. <em>Martz v. Beneficial Mont., Inc., </em>2006 MT 94, \u00b6 10, 332 Mont. 93, 135 P.3d 790; <em>Rich, </em>\u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">\u00b618 Cambridge Court claims the District Court erred in its decision. First, Cambridge Court argues the arbitration provision in Section 8.10 was conspicuous, clear, unambiguous, and agreed to by both parties. In this connection, Cambridge Court asserts the waiver provision in Section 8.10 was not in conflict with Section 6.12. <em>See Opinion, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 5-6. Second, Cambridge Court asserts that the Agreement was not a contract of adhesion. Cambridge Court argues that Riehl was not forced to execute the Agreement with Cambridge Court because she could have sought admission at other facilities and had alternatives other than Cambridge Court. Further, Cambridge Court asserts that Riehl cannot claim she was \u201ccompelled\u201d to sign the Agreement in order to avoid moving Yanuski a second time, since she had an opportunity to inquire about the terms of the Agreement prior to moving Yanuski into Cambridge Court. Cambridge Court acknowledges that Freeman allowed Yanuski to move in before the appropriate paper work was formalized, but claims this was done in the immediate and best interests of Yanuski in order to place her immediately. Furthermore, Cambridge Court notes that Freeman testified it was her policy to give potential residents time to review the Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">\u00b619 Regarding the \u201cnegotiability\u201d of the Agreement, Cambridge Court argues that Section 8.2 of the Agreement outlines the procedures to be followed in order to amend its terms.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Moreover, Cambridge Court asserts there was no evidence presented that Riehl ever requested negotiation of any of the terms of the Agreement. For these reasons, Cambridge Court asserts that the District Court erred in concluding the Agreement was a contract of adhesion under <em>Kortum-Managhan.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b194-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>\u00b620 Additionally, Cambridge Court argues that the Agreement was enforceable against Riehl because it was within her reasonable expectations and was not unduly oppressive, unconscionable, or against public policy. Cambridge Court claims that Freeman\u2019s explanation to Riehl that it would \u201cprefer\u201d to use arbitration accurately informed her expectations. Cambridge Court also argues that because Riehl was acting as Yanuski\u2019s personal representative, she had a heightened responsibility to be fully informed of the provisions and consequences of the Agreement. Because she reviewed the Agreement, was aware of its contents, and the arbitration provision was unambiguous, Cambridge Court argues it was within her reasonable expectations. Furthermore, Cambridge Court claims the arbitration provision is not unconscionable or against public policy, insofar as the terms of the Agreement are not unreasonably favorable to Cambridge Court, both parties share mutuality of obligation under its terms, and Riehl had meaningful choices and options available to her before deciding to sign it.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">\u00b621 Finally, Cambridge Court argues that the District Court erred in concluding that Riehl did not knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently waive her rights to a jury trial and access to the courts when she signed the Agreement. Cambridge Court disputes the District Court\u2019s analysis under the 10-factor test as recently described in <em>Kortum-Managhan.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">\u00b622 Riehl urges us to affirm. First, Riehl argues that the Agreement was a contract of adhesion. Riehl claims the facts show that Freeman required her to sign the Agreement, and did not actually engage in negotiations with her regarding its contents. Riehl argues the Agreement was presented on a \u201ctake it or leave it\u201d basis, including the arbitration provision, and that the language in Section 8.2 only contemplates modification of the Agreement after it has been executed. Riehl disputes the contention that she had the opportunity to negotiate its terms, especially given the fact that Yanuski was already at Cambridge Court and it would have been very difficult to move her.</p>\n<p id=\"AcU\">\u00b623 Second, Riehl claims that arbitration was simply not within her reasonable expectations, and that she cannot be compelled to arbitrate. Riehl notes that Freeman herself testified that she did not believe the binding arbitration provision would waive Riehl\u2019s rights to a jury trial and access to the courts. Riehl argues that if this was not within Freeman\u2019s reasonable expectations, it could not be within her reasonable expectations either. Riehl disputes the argument that she was somehow under a greater burden to understand the contents of the Agreement, simply because she was acting as Yanuski\u2019s personal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>representative. Riehl also argues the Agreement is unconscionable and against public policy on the grounds that it lacks mutuality of obligation between the parties. Riehl also argues the District Court did not err in its analysis of whether she knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived her rights to access to the courts and a jury trial under the 10-factor test in <em>Kortum-Managhan.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\">\u00b624 Finally, Riehl requests that the arbitration provision in Section 8.10 be stricken from the Agreement due to the conflicts and ambiguities caused by it in relation to Sections 6.12 and 8.9. Riehl argues that when read together, the \u201cLegal Rights\u201d provision (Section 6.12), the \u201cGoverning Law\u201d provision (Section 8.9), and the arbitration provision (Section 8.10), render the Agreement susceptible to at least two reasonable but conflicting interpretations. On the one hand, the \u201cLegal Rights\u201d provision could indicate that the signing party is not waiving any of her rights; on the other hand, the arbitration provision indicates that the rights to a jury trial and access to the courts are being waived. The claimed ambiguity is a function of the fact that Section 8.9 calls for the Agreement to be interpreted according to Oregon law, but that the \u201cinalienable legal rights\u201d referred to in Section 6.12, are not defined under the laws of Oregon or Montana. Thus, Riehl argues, Section 6.12 does not define \u201cinalienable legal rights\u201d clearly, creating confusion as to the applicability and scope of a waiver of the fundamental rights to a jury trial and access to the courts as set forth in the arbitration provision. Riehl also seeks attorney fees under M. R. App. 19(5), for what she terms a \u201cfrivolous\u201d appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">\u00b625 We review de novo the District Court\u2019s disposition of the motion to compel, as well as the motion for summary judgment. <em>Woodruff, </em>\u00b6 5; <em>Rich, </em>\u00b6 12. In <em>Kortum-Managhan, </em>we noted that the threshold inquiry in this context is whether the parties have agreed to arbitrate. <em>Kortum-Managhan, </em>\u00b6 15 (citing <em>Zigrang, </em>\u00b6 8). The existence of such an agreement is a matter of Montana contract law. <em>Kortum-Managhan, </em>\u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">\u00b626 The construction and interpretation of a contract, including the existence of any ambiguities in the provisions of a contract, is a question of law. <em>Performance Machinery Co., Inc. v. Yellowstone Mountain Club, LLC, </em>2007 MT 250, \u00b6 39, 339 Mont. 259, 169 P.3d 394 (citing <em>Ophus v. Fritz, </em>2000 MT 251, \u00b6 19, 301 Mont. 447, 11 P.3d 1192; <em>Mary J. Baker Revoc. Trust v. Cenex Harvest, </em>2007 MT 159, \u00b6 19, 338 Mont. 41, 164 P.3d 851). \u201c \u2018An ambiguity exists where the language of a contract, as a whole, reasonably is subject to two different interpretations.\u2019 \u201d <em>West v. Club at Spanish Peaks, L.L.C., </em>2008 MT 183, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>\u00b6 53, 343 Mont. 434, 186 P.3d 1228 (quoting <em>Wurl v. Polson Sch. Dist. No. 23, </em>2006 MT 8, \u00b6 17, 330 Mont. 282, 127 P.3d 436). \u201cThe existence of an ambiguity must be determined on an objective basis, and an ambiguity exists only if the language is susceptible to at least two reasonable but conflicting meanings.\u201d <em>Performance Machinery, </em>\u00b6 39. If the court determines a contract is ambiguous, it is interpreted \u201cmost strongly\u201d against the party who drafted it. <em>West, </em>\u00b6 53 (citing <em>Eschenbacher v. Anderson, </em>2001 MT 206, \u00b6 24, 306 Mont. 321, 34 P.3d 87); <em>see also Performance Machinery, </em>\u00b6 39 (citing <em>Ophus, </em>\u00b6 31). Furthermore, \u201c \u2018when a contract term is ambiguous, interpretation of the term involves determining a question of fact regarding the intent of the parties to the contract.\u2019 \u201d <em>West, </em>\u00b6 53 (citing <em>Wurl, </em>\u00b6 17).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">\u00b627 We agree with Riehl that the Agreement, as a whole, is ambiguous regarding the scope and applicability of the arbitration provision. Section 6.12, entitled \u201cLegal rights,\u201d states that \u201c[njothing in this agreement shall construe any limit of Resident\u2019s or Owner\u2019s inalienable legal rights.\u201d Neither the Agreement itself, nor the laws of Montana or Oregon, specifically define the term \u201cinalienable legal rights.\u201d However, Section 8.10 states that the parties to the Agreement \u201cunderstand and acknowledge that, by entering into this binding arbitration agreement, they are giving up and waiving their right to have claims decided in a court of law before a judge and a jury.\u201d The Agreement itself never explains how these two provisions are to be reconciled. Section 8.10 informs the parties that they are \u201cwaiving\u201d their legal rights to access to the courts. Section 6.12 informs the resident that \u201cnothing in this agreement\u201d limits any of their \u201cinalienable legal rights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">\u00b628  We conclude that the Agreement, when considered as a whole, is ambiguous as to whether Riehl actually agreed to waive her rights to access to the courts and a trial by jury when she entered into the Agreement. While the District Court determined that the express language of the waiver clause was not, in and of itself, internally ambiguous or misleading, it did find that the wavier in Section 8.10 could be misleading or ambiguous given that Section 6.12 states that nothing in the Agreement shall construe any limits on the resident\u2019s \u201cinalienable legal rights.\u201d However, we review the District Court\u2019s decision in this case de novo are not bound by its reasoning or interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">\u00b629 Accordingly, we consider whether the parties actually intended to agree to the binding arbitration provision as a question of fact. <em>West, </em>\u00b6 53. As noted above, <em>see Opinion, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 7-8, Freeman specifically <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>testified that she did not know or believe that the Agreement called for binding arbitration. Instead, Freeman thought that Cambridge Court merely \u201cpreferred\u201d arbitration. Thus, as a factual question, Freeman, on behalf of Cambridge Court, did not intend to enter into a binding arbitration agreement with Riehl.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Similarly, Riehl stated to the District Court that she had \u201cno idea\u201d that the Agreement required her to waive her rights to a jury trial. Thus, we hold there was no \u201cmutual intent,\u201d or \u201cmeeting of the minds,\u201d between the parties regarding the binding arbitration provision in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">\u00b630 As Riehl notes, Section 8.4 of the Agreement contains a severability clause which specifically states that \u201c[i]f any term or provision of this Agreement proves to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.\u201d We conclude the arbitration provision, Section 8.10, is unenforceable against Riehl in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">\u00b631 Since we hold that the arbitration provision is unenforceable against Riehl due to ambiguities in the Agreement and a lack of mutual consent between the parties to agree to arbitration, it is not necessary for this Court to decide whether the Agreement was a contract of adhesion, or whether the arbitration provision was within the reasonable expectations of Riehl, or unconscionable. Nor must this Court consider whether Riehl waived her rights to access to the courts and a trial by jury, because in any event the arbitration provision is unenforceable against Riehl. Likewise, our decision disposes of Cambridge Court\u2019s argument under \u00a7 27-5-114(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">\u00b632  We affirm the District Court\u2019s denial of Cambridge Court\u2019s motion to compel arbitration and grant of summary judgment to Riehl. We deny Riehl\u2019s request for attorney fees for work done on appeal. Although we have denied Cambridge Court\u2019s efforts to reverse the District Court, its appeal is meritorious and adequately argued.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">\u00b633 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b197-9\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES LEAPHART, COTTER and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b188-11\"> Riehl notes that Admin. R. M. 37.106.2823 required Cambridge Court to provide the care plan and admission agreement prior to Yanuski\u2019s admission to the Memory Care Unit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b191-6\"> Cambridge Court also filed a motion to stay the District Court proceedings based on pending actions against Sunwest, Inc., in federal court in Oregon. Furthermore, Riehl sought summary judgment on a declaratory judgment count in her complaint that the choice of law provision was unenforceable. The District Court entertained argument on these pending motions at the May 26 hearing as well. The District Court denied the motion to stay and granted Riehl\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the choice of law provision. These rulings have not been appealed and will not be discussed in this Opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b193-7\"> Section 8.2 reads as follows: \u201cAmendments. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between Owner and Resident and no amendment, alteration, modification or addition to this Agreement shall be valid or enforceable unless all parties express consent in writing and sign it. However, Owner may change, without such written, signed expression, and without prior notice, the Resident Handbook, House Rules, or its policies and procedures, so long as the changes would not cause a material breach to this Agreement.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b197-10\"> We note that there is no genuine issue of material fact regarding Freeman\u2019s understanding of the arbitration provision, although Cambridge Court does dispute the legal significance of Freeman\u2019s understanding as it pertains to the question of whether or not the arbitration provision is enforceable against Biehl.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
