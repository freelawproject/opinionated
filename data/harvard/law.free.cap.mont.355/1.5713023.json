We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b29-7\">\u00b62 In 2004, New Outlook was the owner and developer of a five-lot residential subdivision near Kalispell, Montana, known as Cheery Lynn Sites. Sometime in the summer of 2004, Ralph K. Hemp, a partner or member of New Outlook, asked Bruce Weaver, the vice president of Weaver Gravel, Inc. (Weaver Gravel), to inspect the subdivision and submit a bid for improvements to the subdivision. These improvements consisted of the construction of an internal road and cul de sac, installation of water, sewer, and other utilities, and the construction of elevated gravel building pads and driveways.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-8\">\u00b63 Weaver Gravel ultimately contracted with JTL Group, Inc. (JTL), to perform the work on the subdivision, and a bid was prepared by JTL. The bid was submitted in the name of Weaver Gravel. The bid called for material and services to be paid for according to the number of units of each of the components of construction improvements that were provided to the subdivision. New Outlook accepted the bid. JTL installed road base material, asphalt paving, water lines, sewer lines and other utilities, and concluded its work on August 27, 2004. After completion, a dispute arose which primarily concerned the quantity of \u201cpit run\u201d gravel installed as base material beneath the subdivision road.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-9\">\u00b64 On October 14,2004, JTL filed a construction lien on the property comprising the subdivision in the amount of $116,417.57. In May and early July 2005, JTL agreed to execute a partial release of the construction lien as it pertained to lots 3, 4, and 5, of the subdivision, in exchange for payment from New Outlook. The partial release allowed New Outlook to sell these lots. These payments reduced JTL\u2019s lien claim to $50,017.57.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-10\">\u00b65 In July 2005, JTL filed the instant suit against New Outlook, claiming breach of contract, unjust enrichment, and seeking to foreclose on its construction lien. New Outlook filed a counterclaim for slander of title against JTL. New Outlook also filed a separate action against Weaver Gravel for breach of contract and breach of warranty. Weaver Gravel in turn filed third-party claims against JTL, seeking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>indemnification. JTL and Weaver Gravel later resolved these third-party claims.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Prior to trial, New Outlook waived its breach of warranty claim against Weaver Gravel.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-4\">\u00b66 The statutes governing construction liens are found in Title 71, chapter 3, part 5 of the Montana Code Annotated. Section 71-3-531(2), MCA, states that \u201c[a] person who may claim a construction lien pursuant to this part shall give notice of the right to claim a lien to the contracting owner in order to claim a lien.\u201d Sections 71-3-531(3) through (6), MCA, describe these notice requirements with particularity. JTL did not file a notice of its right to claim a construction lien upon New Outlook. However, \u00a7 71-3-531(1), MCA (2003),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> provides several exceptions to this notice requirement. This section reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-5\">The following are not required to give notice of the right to claim a lien as required by this section:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-6\">(a) an person who furnishes services or materials directly to the owner at the owner\u2019s request;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-7\">(b) a wage earner or laborer who performs personal labor services for a person furnishing any service or material pursuant to a real estate improvement contract;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-8\">(c) a person who furnishes services or materials pursuant to a real estate improvement contract that relates to a dwelling for five or more families; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-9\">(d) a person who furnishes services or materials pursuant to a real estate improvement contract that relates to an improvement that is partly or wholly commercial in character.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b30-10\">\u00b67 Prior to trial, New Outlook sought summary judgment on JTL\u2019s failure to file notice of a right to claim a construction lien. New Outlook argued that JTL\u2019s failure to do so rendered the construction lien unenforceable. JTL sought partial summary judgment that its construction lien was valid. JTL argued that the exceptions under \u00a7 71-3-531(l)(a) and (d), MCA, applied and that it was not required to file a notice of its right to claim a lien in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-11\">\u00b68 On November 5, 2007, the District Court denied New Outlook\u2019s motion and granted JTL\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>holding that JTL was exempt from giving New Outlook notice of its right to claim a lien under \u00a7 71-3-531(l)(d), MCA. The District Court held that the purpose of the notice requirements in \u00a7 71-3-531(1), MCA, was to protect the individual homeowner, who is likely \u201cnot savvy\u201d when it comes to construction contracts and the payments of accounts and liens. The District Court determined these policy concerns were not present since New Outlook is a real estate developer. In addition, the District Court concluded that it would look to the nature of the enterprise to determine whether it is \u201ccommercial\u201d in character. In this case, the improvement for which JTL filed its lien was not a house or dwelling, but was instead a road, which could not be characterized as residential. Accordingly, notice of the right to claim the lien was not required and JTL\u2019s attempts to foreclose on its construction lien could go forward.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-4\">\u00b69 A bench trial on the parties\u2019 claims was scheduled to commence on December 3, 2007. On November 29, New Outlook filed a motion to disqualify the presiding judge, the Hon. Katherine R. Curtis, for cause. The trial was postponed by an order of this Court while a substitute judge was brought in and the motion was resolved. The motion was ultimately decided against New Outlook on February 5, 2008, and attorney fees and costs were awarded to JTL following a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">\u00b610 The bench trial was held on June 23-25, 2008. The District Court issued findings of fact, conclusions of law, and an order for partial judgment on August 1, 2008. In its findings, the District Court determined that New Outlook conceded that it owed $21,665.57 to Weaver Gravel, but disputed the $50,017.57 claimed by JTL. The District Court determined that the money claimed was actually owed to JTL and not Weaver Gravel, because it was JTL that actually performed the work and filed a construction lien on the subject property.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">\u00b611 The District Court noted that JTL and New Outlook presented conflicting testimony at trial regarding the amount of pit run gravel supplied by JTL. Ultimately, the District Court determined that JTL failed to meet its burden of proof with regard to the additional amount claimed in its lien over and above the amount New Outlook conceded that it owed. The District Court further found that JTL did not file its lien in bad faith or with actual malice, and did not deliberately inflate the amount it claimed it was owed on the lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-7\">\u00b612 In its conclusions of law, the District Court determined that JTL\u2019s lien was valid under <em>LHC, Inc. v. Alvarez, </em>2007 MT 123, 337 Mont. 294, 160 P.3d 502. The District Court further concluded that JTL had complied with all the procedural requirements of Montana\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>construction lien statutes, and that it was owed $21,665.57, the amount which New Outlook conceded it owed for the work done on the subdivision. The District Court also awarded JTL prejudgment interest. Further, the District Court dismissed New Outlook\u2019s slander of title claim against JTL since it concluded that JTL\u2019s lien was valid.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AXx\">\u00b613 The District Court also denied New Outlook\u2019s claim for breach of contract against Weaver Gravel. The District Court concluded that this claim was based on a prayer for indemnification for any amounts that New Outlook might be ordered to pay over and above the contract amount owed to Weaver Gravel. Since the District Court found that no extra amount was owed by New Outlook, it denied New Outlook\u2019s breach of contract claim against Weaver Gravel.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\">\u00b614 The District Court also awarded JTL and Weaver Gravel costs and reasonable attorney fees. JTL and Weaver Gravel were both represented by the same attorneys. Pursuant to the District Court\u2019s order, JTL and Weaver Gravel submitted a bill of costs and an affidavit in support of an award of attorney fees. New Outlook filed objections. The parties were given an opportunity to request a hearing on attorney fees on or before JTL/Weaver Gravel\u2019s response to New Outlook\u2019s objections were due, or the hearing was deemed waived. New Outlook did not timely request a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">\u00b615 On April 29, 2009, the District Court entered findings of fact, conclusions of law, and its order on attorney fees and costs. JTL\u2019s affidavits sought a total of $119,072.50 in attorney fees. The District Court determined in its findings that the affidavits itemized the hourly rates of the attorneys, contained descriptions of the work performed and hours expended in performing the work, thus representing the \u201clodestar fee\u201d pursuant to <em>Laudert v. Richland Co. Sheriff\u2019s </em>Dept., 2001 MT 287, 307 Mont. 403, 38 P.3d 790.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">\u00b616 New Outlook raised several objections to JTL\u2019s claimed amount of attorney fees. New Outlook argued that much of the work of JTL\u2019s counsel was excessive, redundant, or otherwise unnecessary, and that the time entries were either duplicative or not sufficiently detailed. New Outlook also argued that JTL improperly sought attorney fees for taking and defending depositions which were not used at trial, as well as non-recoverable fees for expert witnesses. Further, New Outlook contended that JTL was not entitled to attorney fees incurred in responding to New Outlook\u2019s motions, and may not recover \u201cfees for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>fees\u201d; i.e., attorney fees incurred in proving the right to recover reasonable attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-4\">\u00b617 The District Court rejected most of New Outlook\u2019s arguments regarding the reasonableness of JTL\u2019s claimed attorney fees. The District Court determined that the billing statements were sufficiently detailed and not for the most part excessive or redundant. The District Court also determined that New Outlook had failed to present evidence or expert witness testimony in support of its arguments against the award, and had failed to overcome the strong presumption that JTL\u2019s lodestar calculation was reasonable. However, the District Court did conclude that some amounts billed were unwarranted and eliminated approximately $7,600 in claimed fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">\u00b618 The District Court then evaluated the reasonableness of JTL\u2019s attorney fees under the following seven-factor test described in <em>Plath v. Schonrock, </em>2003 MT 21, 314 Mont. 101, 64 P.3d 684:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-6\">The reasonableness of attorney fees must be ascertained under the facts of each case. This Court has stated that in determining what constitutes reasonable attorney fees, the following factors should be considered as guidelines: (1) the amount and character of the services rendered; (2) the labor, time and trouble involved; (3) the character and importance of the litigation in which the services were rendered; (4) the amount of money or the value of the property to be affected; (5) the professional skill and experience called for; (6) the attorneys\u2019 character and standing in their profession; and (7) the results secured by the services of the attorneys.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b33-7\"><em>Plath, </em>\u00b6 36 (citing <em>Morning Star Enterprises, Inc. v. R.H. Grover, Inc., </em>247 Mont. 105, 114, 805 P.2d 553, 558 (1991)).</p>\n<p id=\"b33-8\">\u00b619 The District Court carefully analyzed the factors supporting each element of the test, and concluded the claimed fees were reasonable under <em>Plath. </em>For purposes of this Opinion, we deem it unnecessary to recount the entire analysis. The District Court also noted that \u00a7 71-3-124(1), MCA (2003),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> provides for a mandatory award of attorney fees to the prevailing party in a construction lien case. This statute reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-9\">In an action to foreclose any of the liens provided for by part 3, 4, 5, 6, 8 or 10 of this chapter, the court shall allow as costs the money paid and attorney fees incurred for filing and recording the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>lien and reasonable attorney fees in the district and supreme courts. The costs and attorney fees must be allowed to each claimant whose lien is established, and the reasonable attorney fees must be allowed to the defendant against whose property a lien is claimed if the lien is not established.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ac\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b34-4\">\u00b620 In its conclusions of law, the District Court concluded that JTL was entitled to its recoverable costs under Title 25, chapter 10, part 2, and that New Outlook had waived its objections to costs because its objections were untimely. Similarly, the District Court concluded that New Outlook waived its right to a hearing on attorney fees by not filing a request for a hearing until approximately 3 months after the final deadline to request a hearing had passed.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">\u00b621 Under \u00a7 71-3-124(1), MCA, attorney fees are available to a party establishing a construction lien for \u201creasonable attorney fees in the district and supreme courts.\u201d The District Court concluded that attorney fees incurred in the taking and defending of depositions were covered by this statute, even if not used at trial. Similarly, the District Court determined that fees incurred in responding to New Outlook\u2019s various motions were also covered under \u00a7 71-3-124(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">\u00b622 Finally, the District Court concluded that it was not possible to segregate the attorney fees incurred among the construction lien foreclosure action, and the other claims asserted in this case. Because JTL, as the prevailing party, was entitled to attorney fees under <em>Blue Ridge Homes, Inc. v. Thein, </em>2008 MT 264, 345 Mont. 125, 191 P.3d 374, the District Court awarded JTL most of the fees claimed. In this connection, the District Court concluded that New Outlook had failed to produce any evidence or expert testimony sufficient to overcome the \u201cstrong presumption\u201d that the lodestar amount claimed by JTL was reasonable. <em>See Laudert, </em>\u00b6 17. Based on these conclusions, the District Court determined that JTL was entitled to an award of $111,413.50 in attorney fees and $791.50 in costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-7\">\u00b623 After judgment was entered, New Outlook moved to amend or alter the judgment. New Outlook contended that JTL had failed to offer sufficient evidence to establish the construction hen, and that much of the evidence upon which JTL relied was inadmissible hearsay. The District Court deified the motion, noting that New Outlook did not object to the evidence which it was now contesting. The District Court noted that most of the objections put forth by New Outlook in its motion to alter or amend were being raised post-trial for the first time.</p>\n<p id=\"ASG\">\u00b624 New Outlook now appeals from these decisions of the District Court, presenting the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b35-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>\u00b625 Issue One: <em>Did the District Court err in concluding that JTL was not required to give New Outlook notice of its right to claim the construction lien prior to its filing?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b35-4\">\u00b626 Issue Two: <em>Did the District Court err in concluding that JTL had established the construction lien in this case?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">\u00b627 Issue Three: <em>Did the District Court err in denying New Outlook\u2019s claim for breach of contract against Weaver Gravel?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">\u00b628 Issue Four: <em>Did the District Court abuse its discretion in awarding JTL attorney fees and costs?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b35-8\">\u00b629 We review a district court\u2019s ruling on summary judgment de novo. We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether they are correct and its findings of fact to determine whether they are clearly erroneous. <em>Revelation Indus., Inc. v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., </em>2009 MT 123, \u00b6 13, 350 Mont. 184, 206 P.3d 919.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-9\">\u00b630 We review findings of fact in a civil bench trial to determine if they are supported by substantial credible evidence. <em>DeNiro v. Gasvoda, </em>1999 MT 129, \u00b6 9, 294 Mont. 478, 982 P.2d 1002. This Court \u201cmust view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party.\u201d <em>DeNiro, </em>\u00b6 9. Conclusions of law in this context are also reviewed for correctness. <em>DeNiro, </em>\u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-10\">\u00b631 We review for abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to alter or amend a judgment pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 59(g). We also review for an abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s order granting or denying attorney fees. <em>Blue Ridge Homes, </em>\u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-11\">\u00b632 Issue One: <em>Did the District Court err in concluding that JTL was not required to give New Outlook notice of its right to claim the construction lien prior to its filing?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b35-12\">\u00b633 In its grant of partial summary judgment, the District Court determined that JTL was not required to give notice to New Outlook of its right to claim a construction lien by virtue of \u00a7 71-3-53 l(l)(d), MCA. <em>See Opinion, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 6-8. New Outlook claims this was error. It argues the District Court erred when it determined that JTL was exempted from the notice requirements in \u00a7 71-3-531(2), MCA. New Outlook argues that, under the construction lien statutes, the District Court was required to look to the nature and character of the improvement to determine if it was \u201ccommercial in character.\u201d Instead of looking to the use of the improvement, the District Court considered the subjective intent of the developer in having the improvements constructed to ascertain whether the improvement was \u201ccommercial\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>or \u201cresidential\u201d in character. Here, New Outlook argues it is undisputed that the services and materials provided by JTL were for improvements in a residential subdivision with no commercial use. Thus, the improvements was residential, not commercial, in character. By relying upon the fact that New Outlook intended to sell the subdivision for a profit in order to conclude that the improvements were commercial, New Outlook argues the District Court wrongly considered the subjective intent of the developer and in effect altered the plain meaning of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\">\u00b634 JTL urges us to affirm. JTL contends that the infrastructure improvements it provided constituted improvements with an undeniable commercial purpose-i.e., the creation of a sales inventory of buildings lots. In this connection, JTL argues these specific improvements are not conceptually and substantively distinguishable from the construction of a grocery store or office complex for later resale. JTL argues that the character of a real estate development for purposes of the construction lien statutes cannot be dissociated from the commercial nature of the venture within which it was created.</p>\n<p id=\"A6G\">\u00b635 JTL also draws the Court\u2019s attention to the circumstances surrounding the creation of the construction lien which attached to the New Outlook subdivision. JTL notes that under \u00a7 71-3-535(5), MCA, a construction lien attaches at the commencement of the work. When JTL provided services and materials, the subdivision was devoid of any residential improvements and no portion was owned by individual landowners. Further, the property was held by a partnership that was developing the subdivision for a profit. Following the completion of JTL\u2019s work, the property at issue contained nothing more than \u201cempty building lots with newly installed roadways, water, sewer, and other utilities, placed in the stream of commerce for immediate resale.\u201d JTL contends that nothing in the gravel, asphalt, or water and sewer lines is distinctly \u201cresidential,\u201d or non-commercial, in character, and that the District Court did not err in concluding that the exception in \u00a7 71-3-531(l)(d), MCA, applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">\u00b636  We agree with JTL and affirm the District Court. We interpret statutes according to their plain language; if the language of the statute is clear on its face, this Court looks no further. <em>Haney v. Mahoney, </em>2001MT 201, \u00b6 7, 306 Mont. 288, 32 P.3d 1254. Section 71-3-531(l)(d), MCA, exempts a party seeking a construction lien from the notice requirements in \u00a7 71-3-531(2), MCA, if the \u201cservices or materials pursuant to a real estate improvement contract ... [relate] to an improvement that is partly or wholly commercial in character.\u201d Here, JTL provided \u201cpit run\u201d gravel for an internal subdivision road. As JTL <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>correctly notes, its construction lien attached at a time when there were no residential improvements and no property owned by individual homeowners. Further, as noted by the District Court, the improvement for which JTL filed its lien was not a house or dwelling, but was instead a road, which could not be characterized as \u201cresidential\u201d in nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-4\">\u00b637 For the foregoing reasons, the improvements provided by JTL were \u201cpartly or wholly commercial in character,\u201d and therefore the exception to the notice requirement in \u00a7 71-3-53 l(l)(d), MCA, clearly applies. Thus, we affirm the District Court regarding this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">\u00b638 Issue Two: <em>Did the District Court err in concluding that JTL had established the construction lien in this case?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">\u00b639 New Outlook argues that the District Court erred when it concluded that JTL had established a valid construction lien. JTL argues that the construction lien statement filed by JTL and admitted into evidence does not establish when JTL furnished materials and services, and is based on nothing more than inadmissible hearsay and self-serving statements made by JTL\u2019s witnesses at trial. New Outlook also argues that JTL failed to establish at trial that it provided service on New Outlook of its construction lien. New Outlook further argues that the property described in the construction lien does not contain a description of the property sufficient to identify it as required under \u00a7 71-3-535(3)(b), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">\u00b640 JTL offers a persuasive counterargument to which New Outlook offers no reply.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> First, JTL notes the District Court\u2019s finding that New Outlook essentially conceded that it owed JTL $21,665.57 for materials it provided. Second, it notes that the issues now raised by New Outlook were never raised in the pretrial order, or preserved for appeal. Instead, New Outlook raised them for the first time in its post-trial Rule 59(g) motions. JTL further observes that the construction lien, which New Outlook now claims is inadmissible hearsay, was admitted into evidence <em>without objection. </em>For these reasons, JTL argues that New Outlook\u2019s arguments should be rejected under <em>Alvarez. </em>Alternatively, JTL contends that it did in fact present sufficient evidence to support the construction lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-8\">\u00b641  In its denial of New Outlook\u2019s Rule 59(g) motions, the District Court noted that New Outlook had failed to raise these same issues prior to trial, and therefore waived them. We agree. The arguments now presented by New Outlook were raised for the first time in post-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>trial motions, and are therefore waived. <em>Alvarez, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 20-21. Similarly, New Outlook has waived its ability to challenge the admissibility of JTL\u2019s construction lien statement, since it failed to object to its admissibility at trial. <em>See City of Helena v. Kortum, </em>2003 MT 290, \u00b6 16, 318 Mont. 77, 78 P.3d 882. Therefore, we affirm the District Court on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\">\u00b642 Issue Three: <em>Did the District Court err in denying New Outlook\u2019s claim for breach of contract against Weaver Gravel ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">\u00b643 New Outlook\u2019s claim for breach of contract against Weaver Gravel was based on the prospect that it might have to pay JTL an amount in excess of the $21,665.57 that New Outlook conceded it owed. Having determined that New Outlook did not owe anything over and above this amount, the District Court denied the breach of contract claim. New Outlook claims this was error, complaining that it now owes attorney fees and prejudgment interest in excess of $157,000 as a result of Weaver Gravel\u2019s breach of contract. New Outlook argues that the District Court\u2019s decision should be reversed so that the breach of contract claims can now go forward.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">\u00b644 JTL urges us to affirm. JTL notes that New Outlook made it \u201cabundantly clear\u201d in the pretrial order that the basis of its breach of contract claim was the prospect that it might have to pay JTL some amount in excess of what it conceded it owed to Weaver Gravel. Since the District Court found that it did not owe an amount in excess of this figure, it properly dismissed the breach of contract claim. JTL contends that the additional amounts now owed by New Outlook for attorney fees and prejudgment interest are not relevant to the breach of contract claim it posited at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">\u00b645  We agree with JTL and affirm the District Court. The additional amounts now owed by New Outlook are based on attorney fees and prejudgment interest and are not relevant to the breach of contract claims it presented at trial. The District Court did not err in rejecting those claims once it determined that New Outlook did not owe Weaver Gravel an amount in excess of $21,665.57.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-8\">\u00b646 Issue Four: <em>Did the District Court abuse its discretion in awarding JTL attorney fees and costs?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b38-9\">\u00b647 Finally, New Outlook contends that the District Court erred in awarding attorney fees to JTL. First, New Outlook argues that JTL failed to present any evidence or third-party expert testimony to support an award of attorney fees. Instead, New Outlook contends that JTL relied upon the \u201cself-serving\u201d affidavits of its attorneys to establish an award of attorney fees. Second, New Outlook asserts that many of the fees incurred by JTL in this case were unrelated to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>construction lien, and should not have been awarded by the District Court. Third, New Outlook argues that attorney fees incurred in connection with the taking and defending of depositions, as well as those fees related to the presentation of expert testimony, are not recoverable in this case. Fourth, New Outlook generally contends that JTL\u2019s claim of over 190 hours of trial preparation attorney fees in October and November 2007 is excessive. Fifth, New Outlook claims that the District Court erred in awarding JTL attorney fees it incurred in establishing its right to attorney fees-i.e., \u201cfees for fees.\u201d For these reasons, New Outlook argues the District Court\u2019s award of attorney fees should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-4\">\u00b648 JTL contends that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in awarding attorney fees, and that its decision should be upheld. JTL notes that New Outlook filed untimely objections to the costs, did not request a hearing on attorney fees, and did not present any expert testimony or evidence to overcome the presumption that the lodestar calculation was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">\u00b649 JTL also argues there was no injustice in the District Court\u2019s decision. JTL maintains that New Outlook unnecessarily prolonged this case, engaged in discovery abuse, filed numerous motions, and set forth numerous contentions in the pretrial order which JTL had to spend time analyzing and preparing for, even though New Outlook did not litigate many of those contentions at trial. Further, JTL claims that New Outlook indentified several hundred pages of documents, and approximately 112 exhibits, which it had to analyze and consider in order to be properly prepared for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">\u00b650 JTL also contends that the District Court correctly determined that all of the claims in this case were inextricably intertwined, involving the same facts and same witnesses, and that it was not possible to segregate the time among claims. Under <em>Blue Ridge Homes, </em>JTL argues the award of attorney fees was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">\u00b651 We review an award of attorney fees for an abuse of discretion. <em>Blue Ridge Homes, </em>\u00b6 20. An abuse of discretion occurs when the district court acts arbitrarily without the employment of conscientious judgment or exceeds the bounds of reason resulting in substantial injustice. <em>James Talcott Const., Inc. v. P &amp; D Land Enterprises, </em>2006 MT 188, \u00b6 62, 333 Mont. 107, 141 P.3d 1200.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-8\">\u00b652  We agree with JTL that the District Court did not abuse its discretion when it awarded attorney fees. The construction lien statutes contain fee-shifting provisions for the party which prevails in establishing a lien. As we stated in <em>Laudert, </em>\u201cthere is a strong presumption, given the rationale behind fee-shifting provisions, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>the lodestar fee is a reasonable fee.\u201d <em>Laudert, </em>\u00b6 17 (citing <em>Pennsylvania v. Delaware Valley Citizens\u2019 Council for Clean Air, </em>478 U.S. 546, 565, 106 S. Ct. 3088, 3098 (1986)). Here, the lodestar fee established by JTL was entitled to this presumption of reasonableness, and New Outlook failed to produce sufficient evidence to overcome this presumption. As noted by JTL, New Outlook waived its right to a hearing on attorney fees, and presented no expert testimony or evidence to demonstrate that JTL\u2019s lodestar calculation was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\">\u00b653  Furthermore, the District Court correctly determined that the claims in this case were intertwined, and acted within its discretion when it awarded JTL attorney fees based on the construction lien statutes. <em>See Blue Ridge Homes, </em>\u00b6 78 (noting that a district court may consider intertwined claims, involving the same factual and legal issues, for purposes of calculating attorney fees and costs). Similarly, the award of attorney fees incurred in the taking and defending of depositions was reasonable under \u00a7 71-3-124(1), MCA, as this statute allows the party who establishes a construction lien to recover fees incurred \u201cin the district and supreme courts.\u201d Finally, we specifically held in <em>Blue Ridge Homes, </em>that \u201cfees for fees\u201d are recoverable in actions which establish a construction lien. <em>Blue Ridge Homes, </em>\u00b6 81. In sum, New Outlook has failed to demonstrate how, under the circumstances of this case, the District Court\u2019s award of attorney fees was arbitrary, unreasonable, or resulted in substantial injustice to New Outlook.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">\u00b654 The District Court did not err in concluding that JTL was exempt from giving New Outlook notice of its right to file a construction lien in this case, nor did it err in determining that JTL successfully established a construction lien. Further, the District Court did not err in denying New Outlook\u2019s breach of contract claims against Weaver Gravel. Finally, we conclude the District Court did not abuse its discretion in awarding attorney fees.
