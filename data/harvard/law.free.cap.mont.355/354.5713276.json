We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-15\">\u00b62 We review the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b373-16\">\u00b63 <em>Do \u00a7\u00a7 46-11-410(2) and 46-1-202(9), MCA, preclude conviction for both sexual intercourse without consent and sexual assault?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b373-17\">\u00b64 <em>Did Williams\u2019s counsel provide ineffective assistance that would warrant withdrawal of Williams\u2019s Alford pleas?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b373-18\">\u00b65 <em>Did the District Court properly impose restitution?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b373-19\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b373-20\">\u00b66 The State of Montana (State) filed an information on December 27, 2007, that charged Williams with sexual intercourse without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>consent, sexual assault, assault on a minor, and intimidation. The State\u2019s affidavit in support of the information alleged that Williams had attacked his girlfriend\u2019s thirteen year old daughter on December 16, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">\u00b67 Williams entered Jane Doe\u2019s room and tried to rape her. Jane Doe tried to escape. Williams choked her and threatened to kill her if she told her mother. Williams kissed her, touched her all over her body, and penetrated her vagina with his finger. Williams blocked the front door of the house after the first attack so that Jane Doe could not leave. Williams attempted to accost Jane Doe a second time, but she escaped from the house and fled to her mother\u2019s place of employment. Jane Doe immediately reported the incident to law enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">\u00b68 An evaluation at the hospital revealed that Jane Doe had abrasions and scrapes around her neck and a bruised cheek. She had marks all over her body, redness around her rectum, and vaginal bleeding. The State subsequently presented DNA testing that verified that Williams had been the attacker. The State elected to charge Williams for all the offenses based upon a single attack-the one that occurred in Jane Doe\u2019s bedroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">\u00b69 Williams maintains he has no memory of the attack and that he had doubts as to his guilt despite the DNA evidence. The State and Williams eventually reached a plea agreement. Williams entered a plea of guilty to the sexual intercourse without consent and sexual assault charges in exchange for the State agreeing to dismiss the assault on a minor and intimidation charges. The plea agreement called for thirty years in the Montana State Prison with five years suspended on each charge. The two sentences were to run concurrently. The agreement provided that Williams would enter pleas pursuant to <em>North Carolina v. Alford, </em>400 U.S. 25, 918. Ct. 160 (1970), due to Williams\u2019s alleged lack of memory of the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">\u00b610 Williams filed several acknowledgments and waivers of his rights according to his <em>Alford </em>pleas. The District Court reviewed these documents and conducted an extended plea colloquy to discuss Williams\u2019s rights at the change of plea hearing on June 11, 2008. One of the waiver documents signed by Williams noted that sexual assault constituted a lesser-included offense of sexual intercourse without consent. The court advised Williams at the hearing that \u201csexual assault is probably by definition a lesser-included offense of sexual intercourse without consent.\u201d Williams admitted that he was accepting the plea agreement to avoid \u201cmore serious sentences that might be imposed\u201d if he had proceeded to trial. Williams did not dispute the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>validity of the State\u2019s DNA evidence that confirmed that Williams had attacked Jane Doe. Williams also conceded that the DNA evidence provided the State with sufficient evidence to proceed to trial and have a jury find him guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">\u00b611 Williams filed a motion to withdraw his guilty pleas eight days later. Williams and the State filed briefs and the District Court held a hearing on September 10, 2008. Williams\u2019s counsel argued that Williams\u2019s timely request and the fact that he did not understand the ramifications of <em>Alford </em>pleas on sex offender treatment and whether he could obtain parole supported withdrawal of his pleas. Williams\u2019s counsel raised no statutory double jeopardy argument regarding multiple punishments for the two charges. Williams\u2019s counsel also failed to raise the issue of whether sexual assault constituted a lesser-included offense of sexual intercourse without consent. The court denied Williams\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty pleas at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"Ajr\">\u00b612 The District Court sentenced Williams, consistent with the plea agreement, to two concurrent terms of thirty years in the Montana State Prison with five years suspended. The court further ordered that Williams pay for Jane Doe\u2019s reasonable medical and counseling costs. The court failed to set a specific amount of restitution. Williams appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">\u00b613 Determinations regarding Montana\u2019s statutory double jeopardy protections under \u00a7 46-11-410, MCA, present questions of law that this Court reviews for correctness. <em>State v. Becker, </em>2005 MT 75, \u00b6 14, 326 Mont. 364, 110 P.3d 1. We review <em>de novo </em>ineffective assistance of counsel claims because they involve mixed questions of law and fact. <em>Becker, </em>\u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">\u00b614 <em>Do \u00a7\u00a7 </em>46-11-410(2) <em>and 46-1-202(9), MCA, preclude conviction for both sexual intercourse without consent and sexual assault?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b375-9\">\u00b615 Montana law precludes convicting a defendant of more than one offense if \u201cone offense is included in the other.\u201d Section 46-ll-410(2)(a), MCA. Williams contends that sexual assault constitutes an included offense of sexual intercourse without consent under \u00a7 46-ll-410(2)(a), MCA. The State argues that Williams\u2019s failure to raise this statutory double jeopardy claim before the District Court bars him from raising it for the first time on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>\u00b616 This Court generally will not address issues raised for the first time on appeal. <em>State v. Longfellow, </em>2008 MT 343, \u00b6 19, 346 Mont. 286, 194 P.3d 694. Williams raises his statutory double jeopardy claims as part of his challenge to the District Court\u2019s jurisdiction to accept his <em>Alford </em>pleas and to the effectiveness of his counsel\u2019s assistance. This Court addressed a similar statutory-based double jeopardy claim for the first time on appeal in the context of an ineffective assistance of counsel claim in <em>Becker. Becker, </em>\u00b6 17. The same analysis applies here. \u00b617 In <em>Becker, </em>the State charged Becker with criminal production or manufacture of dangerous drugs by accountability, felony criminal possession of dangerous drugs, and criminal possession of precursors to dangerous drugs. <em>Becker, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 7, 9. Becker\u2019s trial counsel filed a motion to dismiss the criminal possession of precursors to dangerous drugs charge as a violation of the statutory prohibition against double jeopardy. <em>Becker, </em>\u00b6 9. Becker\u2019s counsel argued that the precursor charge arose out of the same conduct as the criminal possession charge, but failed to include the statutory double jeopardy claims in the motion to dismiss the possession of dangerous drugs charge. <em>Becker, </em>\u00b6 20. Becker\u2019s counsel relied upon only the constitutional double jeopardy analysis from <em>Blockburger v. U.S., 284 </em>U.S. 299, 52 S. Ct. 180 (1932). <em>Becker, </em>\u00b6 20. The district court denied Becker\u2019s motion to dismiss and he proceeded to trial where the jury convicted him on all counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">\u00b618 Becker argued on appeal that his convictions for criminal possession of dangerous drugs and criminal possession of precursors to dangerous drugs, in addition to his conviction for production of methamphetamine, violated his statutory protection against double jeopardy. <em>Becker, </em>\u00b6 13. This Court determined that criminal possession of dangerous drugs constituted a lesser-included offense of criminal production or manufacture of dangerous drugs under \u00a7 46-11-410, MCA. <em>Becker, </em>\u00b6 24. The Court vacated Becker\u2019s conviction for that charge. <em>Becker, </em>\u00b6 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">\u00b619 This Court has assumed in multiple cases, without actually deciding, that sexual assault constitutes a lesser-included offense to sexual intercourse without consent. <em>See State v. Stevens, </em>2002 MT 181, \u00b6 54, 311 Mont. 52, 53 P.3d 356. Montana law defines \u201cincluded offense\u201d as an offense that a) is established by proof of the same or less than all the facts required to establish the commission of the offense charged; b) consists of an attempt to commit the offense charged or to commit an offense otherwise included in the offense charged; or c) differs from the offense charged only in the respect that a less serious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>injury or risk to the same person, or a lesser kind of culpability suffices to establish its commission. Section 46-1-202(9), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">\u00b620 Williams failed to raise subsection (b) of \u00a7 46-1-202(9), MCA, so we decline to address it now. We find it worth noting, however, that the State chose to charge Williams only for the first attack on Jane Doe. The information filed against Williams also mentioned a second attempted attack on Jane Doe as she tried to leave the house. This second attempted attack could have formed the basis for additional charges that might have altered our discussion of the matter regarding two separate transactions. We must take the case as it comes to us. We turn then to Williams\u2019s arguments regarding subsection (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">\u00b621 The \u201cfacts\u201d required under \u00a7 46-1-202(9), MCA, subsection (a), to establish the commission of the charged offense refers to statutory elements of offenses rather than to the facts of an individual case. <em>State v. Beavers, </em>1999 MT 260, \u00b6 30, 296 Mont. 340, 987 P.2d 371. Thus, under \u00a7 46-l-202(9)(a), MCA, the statutory elements of sexual assault must be the same as, or less than, the statutory elements of sexual intercourse without consent. This Court recently addressed a similar lesser-included question under \u00a7 46-l-202(9)(a), MCA, in <em>State v. Weatherell, </em>2010 MT 37, 355 Mont. 230, 225 P.3d 1256.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">\u00b622 Weatherell challenged on double jeopardy grounds his convictions for assault on a minor and partner or family member assault (PFMA). <em>Weatherell, </em>\u00b6 11. The Court analyzed each element of assault on a minor and PFMA in considering whether assault on a minor constituted an included offense of PFMA. The Court analyzed each element of the criminal offenses: 1) the mental state; 2) the required conduct; and 3) the attendant circumstances. <em>Weatherell, </em>\u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">\u00b623 The Court determined that even though the mental states and conduct are identical, \u201cthe attendant circumstances of PFMA and assault on a minor differ, with neither being a subset of the other.\u201d <em>Weatherell, </em>\u00b6 13. The Court recognized that PFMA required proof that the victim was a family member, but PFMA did not require proof that the victim was a minor. <em>Weatherell, </em>\u00b6 13. The elements of assault on a minor, by contrast, required proof that the victim was a minor, but not that the victim was a family member. The Court concluded that \u201cdespite some overlap\u201d assault on a minor did not represent an included offense of PFMA. <em>Weatherell, </em>\u00b6 13. Here sexual assault and sexual intercourse without consent also have identical mental states and conduct. Unlike <em>Weatherell, </em>however, the attendant circumstances of sexual assault represent a subset of the attendant circumstances of sexual intercourse without consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>\u00b624 A person commits the offense of sexual assault by knowingly subjecting, another person to any sexual contact without consent. Section 45-5-502, MCA. The statute defines \u201csexual contact\u201d as touching of the sexual or other intimate parts of the person of another in order to knowingly or purposely cause bodily injury or humiliate, or to arouse or gratify either party. Section 45-2-101(67), MCA. \u201cWithout consent\u201d retains its ordinary meaning but the statute also provides for instances where a victim may be incapable of consent. <em>Stevens, </em>\u00b6 59; \u00a7 45-5-502(5), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">\u00b625 Sexual intercourse without consent involves knowingly engaging in sexual intercourse without the consent of another person. Section 45-5-503(1), MCA. Sexual intercourse means the penetration of the vulva, anus, or mouth of one person by the penis or body member of another person, or by foreign instrument, knowingly or purposefully to cause bodily injury or arouse either party. Section 45-2-101(68), MCA. The statute defines \u201cwithout consent\u201d either as the victim being compelled to submit by force or being incapable of consent for a variety of circumstances. Section 45-5-50l(l)(a), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">\u00b626 The statutes establish \u201cknowingly\u201d as the mental state for both sexual assault and sexual intercourse without consent. Sections 45-5-502 and 45-5-503, MCA. The required conduct of \u201csexual contact\u201d under sexual assault could be construed as \u201cless than\u201d the required conduct of \u201csexual intercourse\u201d under \u00a7 45-2-101(68), MCA. For example, the touching of the sexual or intimate parts of a person constituting sexual assault potentially involves less egregious conduct than the penetration required for sexual intercourse without consent. \u00b627 Finally, the attendant circumstances of sexual assault-the ordinary definition of wdthout consent-represent a subset of \u201cwithout consent\u201d as defined under \u00a7 45-5-501(1), MCA. The ordinary meaning of \u201cwithout consent\u201d fits squarely within the definition under \u00a7 45-5-501(l)(i), MCA, that \u201cthe victim is compelled to submit by force against the victim or another.\u201d The State argues that sexual assault contains different age elements under the \u201cwithout consent\u201d definition at \u00a7 45-5-502(5)(a)(ii), MCA. The State contends that these age elements require different proof that is not \u201cthe same as or less than\u201d the proof required under the sexual intercourse without consent definition under \u00a7 45-5-501(l)(ii)(D), MCA. The State erroneously focuses on the facts of this case, rather than the elements of the crimes. <em>Beavers, </em>\u00b6 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">\u00b628  A sexual intercourse without consent conviction does not <em>require </em>a victim to be less than 16 years old. Likewise, a sexual assault conviction does not <em>require </em>the victim to be less than 14 years old and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>the offender to be more than three years older than the victim. These age specifications represent one way to satisfy the \u201cwithout consent\u201d element under each statute. The State can demonstrate the required proof in a variety of ways. Sexual assault\u2019s \u201cwithout consent\u201d plain meaning definition falls squarely within the scope of sexual intercourse without consent\u2019s statutory definition in \u00a7 45-5-501(1), MCA. As a result, sexual assault qualifies as a lesser-included offense of sexual intercourse without consent. <em>Beavers, </em>\u00b6 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">\u00b629 This Court reversed an aggravated assault conviction in <em>State v. Russell, </em>2008 MT 417, \u00b6\u00b6 24, 44, 347 Mont. 301, 198 P.3d 271, where the State had charged the aggravated assault based upon the same attack as the felony homicide charge. The State conceded that it had used the same evidence to prove the stand-alone aggravated assault charge and the predicate felony relied upon in the felony homicide charge. <em>Russell, </em>\u00b6 24. We determined that aggravated assault constituted both an included offense and an element of felony homicide. <em>Russell, </em>\u00b6 24. As a result, we reversed and vacated Russell\u2019s conviction on the aggravated assault charge. <em>Russell, </em>\u00b6 44. We left intact Russell\u2019s conviction on the felony homicide charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">\u00b630  Here, \u00a7 46-ll-410(2)(a), MCA, precludes the State from convicting Williams of both sexual intercourse without consent and sexual assault where the charges arose from the same attack as alleged in the information. We reverse and vacate Williams\u2019s conviction for sexual assault. As in <em>Russell, </em>however, we leave intact Williams\u2019s conviction for sexual intercourse without consent. <em>Russell, </em>\u00b6 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">\u00b631 <em>Did Williams\u2019s counsel provide ineffective assistance that would warrant withdrawal of Williams\u2019s Alford pleas ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">\u00b632 Williams argues that his counsel\u2019s failure to raise the statutory double jeopardy argument under \u00a7 46-ll-410(2)(a), MCA, constitutes ineffective assistance. This Court faced a similar argument in <em>Becker. </em>Becker argued on appeal that his trial counsel\u2019s performance had been deficient under <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052 (1984). <em>Becker, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 17-18. This Court analyzed Becker\u2019s trial counsel\u2019s performance under the two-prong <em>Strickland </em>test. The Court determined that Becker\u2019s trial counsel\u2019s deficient performance had prejudiced Becker by failing to raise the statutory double jeopardy argument in the motion to dismiss. <em>Becker, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 20-21. The Court agreed that \u201cBecker would have been sentenced to a lesser term\u201d had his counsel made the appropriate argument. <em>Becker, </em>\u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>\u00b633 Williams argues that his counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to advise him that the State could not have convicted him of both sexual assault and sexual intercourse without consent had he proceeded to trial. No guarantee exists, however, that Williams would have received a lesser sentence had he proceeded to trial. Williams acknowledged during the plea colloquy that he entered the pleas to avoid potentially more serious consequences if he had proceeded to trial. Williams faced a potential one-hundred-year sentence for a conviction on the sexual intercourse without consent charge. Williams did not face a situation, as in <em>Becker </em>or <em>Russell, </em>where he could have received a lesser term had his counsel argued differently. <em>Becker, </em>\u00b6 21; <em>Russell, </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">\u00b634 Williams cannot satisfy the prejudice prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test even if this Court were to assume that Williams\u2019s trial counsel performed deficiently by not raising the double jeopardy argument during the plea negotiation stage of the proceedings. Williams entered <em>Alford </em>pleas to two separate plea charges, but the District Court imposed sentences for each to run concurrently. Williams has failed to establish that his trial counsel\u2019s ineffective assistance prejudiced him in light of the fact that he still would have been sentenced to thirty years with five years suspended on the valid count for sexual intercourse without consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">\u00b635 Williams argues alternatively that his counsel\u2019s failure to argue that the District Court had misrepresented Williams\u2019s options and the maximum sentence he might have faced by going to trial constitutes \u201cgood cause\u201d to withdraw his <em>Alford </em>pleas. Pursuant to \u00a7 46-16-105(2), MCA, a defendant may withdraw a guilty plea for good cause shown. Williams predicates his claim of good cause upon the alleged ineffective assistance of his counsel in advising him on the proposed plea agreement. A defendant must satisfy both prongs of <em>Strickland </em>in order to establish the good cause requirement. <em>State v. Henderson, </em>2004 MT 173, \u00b6 17, 332 Mont. 69, 93 P.3d 1231.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">\u00b636 We note first that the District Court advised Williams that sexual assault \u201cprobably\u201d constitutes a lesser-included offense of sexual intercourse without consent. We further note that the waiver document signed by Williams explicitly stated that sexual assault constitutes a lesser-included offense of sexual intercourse without consent. More importantly, Williams cannot prove the prejudice prong of <em>Strickland. </em>Williams still faced a one-hundred-year sentence on the valid sexual intercourse without consent count. Williams\u2019s decision to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>accept the <em>Alford </em>plea saved Williams from a potentially far greater sentence had he proceeded to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">\u00b637  We decline to assume that counsel\u2019s failure to include the statutory double jeopardy claim in Williams\u2019s motion to withdraw his pleas constituted ineffective assistance of counsel. The plea agreement benefited Williams. He avoided a potentially more serious sentence if he had been convicted of the single count of sexual intercourse without consent. The evidence pointed to a likely conviction. The physical examination of Jane Doe revealed an attack. She suffered from abrasions and scrapes around her neck and face. Jane Doe also had marks all over her body, redness around her rectum, and vaginal bleeding. And the unchallenged DNA evidence pointed to Williams as the attacker. Williams could make no defense of consensual sexual contact as the age of Jane Doe precluded any consent on her part. Section 45-5-501(l)(a)(ii)(D), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">\u00b638  Finally, the remedy for any statutory double jeopardy violation would not have included the withdrawal of Williams\u2019s pleas to all charges. The remedy, as we pointed out here, would have, at best, allowed Williams to withdraw his plea to the lesser-included offense of sexual assault. <em>Opinion, </em>\u00b6 30; <em>Russell, </em>\u00b6 44. We must keep in mind that no double jeopardy violation, statutory or otherwise, took place until the District Court actually imposed a final sentence and entered the judgment. <em>Russell, </em>\u00b6 25. As we noted in <em>Russell, </em>nothing under the rules of double jeopardy analysis precludes the State from seeking, and obtaining, a conviction on a more serious charge and a lesser-included offense to the more serious charge. <em>Russell, </em>\u00b6 20. A potential double jeopardy violation arises only once the court imposes a separate sentence on the lesser-included offense when the facts giving rise to the offense mirror those used to prove the more serious offense. <em>Russell, </em>\u00b6 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">\u00b639  Williams will receive the remedy available for the statutory double jeopardy violation that he has raised on appeal. We have vacated the lesser-included sexual assault charge and leave intact Williams\u2019s conviction for sexual intercourse without consent. <em>Russell, </em>\u00b6 44. <em>Russell </em>presents an analogous situation. Russell\u2019s double jeopardy violation did not entitle him to a new trial. It entitled him to the dismissal of the lesser-included offense. <em>Russell, </em>\u00b6 44. Williams\u2019s double jeopardy violation does not entitle him to withdraw his guilty plea to the valid sexual intercourse without consent charge. It entitles him to dismissal of the lesser-included sexual assault charge. The District Court correctly concluded that Williams had failed to establish <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>good cause to withdraw his guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">\u00b640 <em>Did the District Court properly impose restitution?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">\u00b641  The court imposed restitution payments on Williams for Jane Doe\u2019s \u201creasonable medical and counseling costs.\u201d The District Court imposed no specific amount of restitution. Section 46-18-244(1), MCA, mandates that the sentencing court \u201cshall specify the total amount of restitution that the offender shall pay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">\u00b642 The State concedes that the requirement of \u00a7 46-18-244(1), MCA, to specify the amount of restitution applies. The State presented no evidence of the amount of loss suffered by Jane Doe. We do not doubt that Jane Doe suffered greatly as a result of Williams\u2019s attack. The State elected to forgo any effort, however, to quantify her loss in the form of future counseling expenses or other areas. Accordingly, \u00a7 46-18-244(1), MCA, requires the Court to reverse the District Court\u2019s imposition of a restitution award.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">\u00b643 Sexual assault constitutes a lesser-included offense of sexual intercourse without consent under \u00a7 46-ll-410(2)(a), MCA. We reverse Williams\u2019s conviction for sexual assault and vacate the sentence. <em>Russell, </em>\u00b6 44. We leave intact Williams\u2019s conviction of sexual intercourse without consent and the thirty-year sentence imposed by the District Court. We also strike the restitution award from Williams\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<judges id=\"b382-9\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES LEAPHART, COTTER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
