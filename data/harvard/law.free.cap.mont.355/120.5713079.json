We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-10\">\u00b62 We review the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b147-11\">\u00b63 <em>Did the District Court correctly dismiss McKinnon\u2019s intentional injury claim for failure to state a claim ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b147-12\">\u00b64 <em>Did the District Court correctly apply M. R. Civ. P. 24(d) when it dismissed McKinnon\u2019s constitutional challenge?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b147-13\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b147-14\">\u00b65 A railcar traumatically amputated both of McKinnon\u2019s legs while he was working for Western Sugar Cooperative Corporation (Western Sugar) on February 15, 2005. McKinnon received workers\u2019 compensation benefits for his injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-15\">\u00b66 McKinnon filed his original complaint on February 9, 2007, in which he sought to circumvent the exclusivity provision of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. Section 39-71-411, MCA. McKinnon initially did not serve Western Sugar. McKinnon alleged in his complaint that Western Sugar had engaged in inherently dangerous, ultra-hazardous work practice and had violated its non-delegable duty to provide a safe workplace. McKinnon claimed that Western Sugar\u2019s actions had proximately caused his injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-16\">\u00b67 This Court issued its opinion in <em>Brady v. PPL Montana, </em>2008 MT 177, 343 Mont. 405, 185 P.3d 330, after McKinnon had filed his complaint. <em>Brady </em>came to this Court with an incomplete factual record on a certified question pursuant to M. R. App. P. 44 from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. We declined in <em>Brady </em>to address the constitutionality of the Workers Compensation exclusivity provision in a \u201cfactual vacuum.\u201d <em>Brady, </em>\u00b6 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-17\">\u00b68 McKinnon amended his complaint in light of <em>Brady </em>to include a constitutional challenge to \u00a7 39-71-413, MCA. McKinnon filed his first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>amended complaint on July 18, 2008. McKinnon specifically alleged that Western Sugar\u2019s conduct met the statutory exception to Workers\u2019 Compensation exclusivity. McKinnon also argued that \u00a7 39-71-413, MCA, was unconstitutional both on its face and as applied to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">\u00b69 McKinnon timely served Western Sugar on September 12, 2008. Western Sugar filed a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim on October 1,2008. McKinnon served the Attorney General with a copy of his first amended complaint on October 7, 2008. The Attorney General acknowledged receipt of service on October 10, 2008. The Attorney General did not file a motion to intervene.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">\u00b610 The District Court granted Western Sugar\u2019s motion to dismiss on all counts following oral argument. The court specifically found that McKinnon\u2019s claims did not fit within the statutory exception to Workers\u2019 Compensation exclusivity. The court also dismissed with prejudice McKinnon\u2019s constitutional challenges for failing to provide the Attorney General with notice at the time that he had filed his first amended complaint and before he had served Western Sugar.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">\u00b611 McKinnon filed a notice of appeal on June 4, 2009. McKinnon notified the Attorney General of his appeal on the same date. The Attorney General filed notice of its intent to intervene on June 29, 2009. Western Sugar moved to dismiss McKinnon\u2019s substantive constitutional challenges. This Court granted Western Sugar\u2019s motion to the extent that the appeal would be limited to the procedural issue of whether the District Court correctly interpreted M. R. Civ. P. 24(d). McKinnon concurred. The Attorney General withdrew its notice of intervention.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">\u00b612 We construe a complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs when reviewing an order dismissing a complaint under M. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). <em>Jones v. Mont. Univ. Sys., </em>2007 MT 82, \u00b6 15, 337 Mont. 1, 155 P.3d 1247. A court should not dismiss a complaint for failure to state a claim unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim that would entitle him to relief. <em>Jones, </em>\u00b6 15. A district court\u2019s determination that a complaint failed to state a claim presents a conclusion of law. <em>Jones, </em>\u00b6 15. We review for correctness a district court\u2019s conclusions of law. <em>Jones, </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b148-10\">\u00b613 <em>Did the District Court correctly dismiss McKinnon\u2019s intentional injury claim for failure to state a claim?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>\u00b614 The District Court determined that McKinnon had failed to state a claim under the exception to the Workers\u2019 Compensation exclusivity provision set forth at \u00a7 39-71-413, MCA. The court agreed with Western Sugar that McKinnon had alleged no injury caused by \u201can intentional and deliberate act\u201d on the part of Western Sugar. Section 39-71-413, MCA. The District Court found that McKinnon had set forth merely a series of allegations that Western Sugar had failed to ensure a safe workplace. The court determined that \u201cwithout using the word negligence, McKinnon has alleged a negligence claim against Western Sugar.\u201d The court further determined that McKinnon had failed to state a claim under \u00a7 39-71-413, MCA, in light of McKinnon\u2019s failure to allege \u201can intentional and deliberate act\u201d on the part of Western Sugar.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">\u00b615 Western Sugar argues that <em>Wise v. CNH Am., LLC, </em>2006 MT 194, 333 Mont. 181, 142 P.3d 774, provides the standard for dismissal in McKinnon\u2019s case. We held in <em>Wise </em>that the plaintiffs failure to allege anything more than ordinary negligence proved insufficient to satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 39-71-413, MCA. We rejected Wise\u2019s arguments that he needed to allege only actions that would have constituted \u201cintentional and malicious\u201d conduct in order to satisfy the statutory requirement. <em>Wise, </em>\u00b6 9. We noted that the 2001 amendment to \u00a7 39-71-413, MCA, specifically had replaced \u201cmalicious\u201d with \u201cdeliberate.\u201d <em>Wise, </em>\u00b6 11; \u00a7 39-71-413, MCA. The legislature also had defined an \u201cintentional injury\u201d as one \u201ccaused by a deliberate act with the specific intent of causing an injury.\u201d <em>Wise, </em>\u00b6 11; \u00a7 39-71-413(3), MCA. We concluded in <em>Wise </em>that following the amendment of \u00a7 39-71-413, MCA, \u201can employee now must allege that he or she has been intentionally injured by the intentional act of an employer or fellow employee in order to avoid the exclusivity provision of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.\u201d <em>Wise, </em>\u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">\u00b616 Wise had alleged only that his employer negligently failed to provide safe working conditions and negligently failed to comply with state and federal regulations. <em>Wise, </em>\u00b6 12. Wise made no allegation that the employer had acted intentionally or deliberately. <em>Wise, </em>\u00b6 12. Wise claimed merely that the specific allegations of negligence in his claim satisfied the pleading requirement by constituting \u201cintentional and deliberate\u201d conduct on the part of his employer. <em>Wise, </em>\u00b6 12. Wise never made the connection of how the alleged negligence constituted intentional and deliberate conduct on the part of his employer. McKinnon\u2019s claim, by contrast, alleges specific intentional and deliberate acts on the part of Western Sugar. McKinnon claims that Western Sugar\u2019s conduct constituted an \u201cintentional and deliberate act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>of engaging in an ongoing policy and practice of moving railcars in an uncontrolled manner, without necessary safety equipment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">\u00b617 McKinnon asserts that his claim sufficiently alleged an intentional act to survive scrutiny under M. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). McKinnon claims that he was not allowed to develop the record through discovery sufficiently to establish the facts necessary to prove his claims. A complaint must contain \u201ca short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\u201d M. R. Civ. P. 8(a). Our cases reflect the principle that liberal rules of pleading allow for compliance with the spirit and intent of the law rather than a rigid adherence to formula or specific words. <em>See R.H. Schwartz Constr. Specialties v. Hanrahan, </em>207 Mont. 105, 672 P.2d 1116 (1983). This Court also has determined that further discovery may constitute an appropriate remedy for lack of specificity in a complaint. <em>Willson v. Taylor, </em>194 Mont. 123, 128, 634 P.2d 1180, 1183 (1981). This determination reflects the principle that \u201c \u2018[t]his Court does not favor the short circuiting of litigation at the initial pleading stage unless a complaint does not state a cause of action under any set of facts.\u2019 \u201d <em>Willson, </em>194 Mont. at 128, 634 P.2d at 1183 (quoting <em>Tobacco River Lbr. Co. v. Yoppe, </em>176 Mont. 267, 271, 577 P.2d 855, 857 (1978)).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">\u00b618 McKinnon specifically alleges that Western Sugar\u2019s conduct fit within the exception to Workers\u2019 Compensation exclusivity at \u00a7 39-71-413, MCA. McKinnon further alleges that Western Sugar\u2019s conduct in regularly moving railcars in an uncontrolled manner without proper safety equipment was intentional and deliberate. McKinnon points out that Western Sugar relies primarily on this Court\u2019s interpretation of the pre-2001 statutory provision. McKinnon asserts that our holding in <em>Brady </em>indicates that the 2001 amendment to \u00a7 39-71-413, MCA, has yet to be interpreted comprehensively by this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">\u00b619 <em>Wise </em>requires that a plaintiff allege facts sufficient to establish deliberate acts by the employer intended to cause injury to the employee. <em>Wise, </em>\u00b6 11. McKinnon alleges that Western Sugar\u2019s practice of moving railcars without proper safety procedures or equipment constituted deliberate conduct. McKinnon further alleges that his severe injury was a certain outcome of this practice. Thus, McKinnon claims that his injury represents the intended outcome of Western Sugar\u2019s deliberate acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">\u00b620  McKinnon\u2019s appeal presents the initial question of whether his complaint alleges conduct sufficient to establish intentional and deliberate conduct that would satisfy the exception to the exclusivity provision of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. The Dissent characterizes McKinnon\u2019s pleading as a negligence claim masquerading as an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>allegation of intentional injury. This argument attenuates the basic principles underlying the concept of notice pleading and denies McKinnon the opportunity to develop the record through discovery. We cannot say beyond doubt that McKinnon can prove no set of facts in support of his claim that would entitle him to relief under these circumstances. <em>Jones, </em>\u00b6 15. At a minimum, the District Court should have afforded McKinnon the opportunity to develop the record through discovery to attempt to show intentional and deliberate action on the part of Western Sugar. <em>Willson, </em>194 Mont. at 128, 634 P.2d at 1183. McKinnon\u2019s claim may fail at the summary judgment stage if he fails through further discovery to establish sufficient evidence to support his allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">\u00b621 <em>Did the District Court correctly apply M. R. Civ. P. 24(d) when it dismissed McKinnon\u2019s constitutional challenge?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">\u00b622 The District Court concluded that McKinnon had failed to provide the Attorney General notice of his constitutional challenge at the time that he filed his first amended complaint in compliance with M. R. Civ. P. 24(d). Rule 24(d) requires a party raising a constitutional issue where the State is not a party to notify the Attorney General \u201ccontemporaneously with the filing of the pleading or other document in which the constitutional issue is raised.\u201d M. R. Civ. P. 24(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">\u00b623 McKinnon filed his first amended complaint on July 18,2008. He served the complaint on Western Sugar on September 11, 2008. McKinnon served and notified the Attorney General on October 7, 2008. The Attorney General\u2019s office acknowledged notice of the complaint on October 10, 2008. The Attorney General did not appear or seek to intervene before the District Court\u2019s May 7, 2009, order granting Western Sugar\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">\u00b624 McKinnon claims that the District Court incorrectly dismissed with prejudice his constitutional challenges. McKinnon argues that no authority exists on which to predicate such a dismissal, especially in light of the fact that the Attorney General had acknowledged proper notification and had chosen not to intervene within the 20 day window allowed by Rule 24(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-9\">\u00b625 We previously have not had occasion to apply Rule 24(d). The District Court accepted Western Sugar\u2019s argument that it should apply our precedent under former M. R. App. P. 38. Rule 38, like M. R. Civ. P. 24(d), required a party challenging the constitutionality of a statute to file notice with the Attorney General \u201ccontemporaneously with the filing of the notice of appeal or with the filing of an original proceeding in the supreme court.\u201d M. R. App. P. 38 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-10\">\u00b626 We determined in <em>Russell v. Masonic Home of Mont., Inc., </em>2006 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>MT 286, 334 Mont. 351, 147 P.3d 216, that the appellant\u2019s failure to serve timely notice on the Attorney General for more than three months after filing a notice of appeal was a failure to \u201cprocedurally comply with an essential condition precedent, thus precluding this court from reaching the constitutional challenge.\u201d <em>Russell, </em>\u00b6 20. McKinnon\u2019s case is distinguishable from <em>Russell, </em>notwithstanding the Dissent\u2019s arguments to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">\u00b627 Russell filed her notice of constitutional challenge with the Attorney General the same week that she filed her opening brief on appeal. Russell had neglected to file notice with the Attorney General under M. R. Civ. P. 24(d) in District Court. Russell\u2019s dilatory filing under M. R. App. P. 38 failed to provide the Attorney General with a meaningful opportunity to respond to the constitutional challenge. McKinnon filed his notice of constitutional challenge shortly after he served his amended complaint on Western Sugar. Neither party had engaged in discovery, filed any motions, or otherwise engaged in pretrial litigation by the time that McKinnon had notified the Attorney General of his constitutional challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">\u00b628 Requiring McKinnon to have served the Attorney General before serving the opposing party or developing his case through discovery does not further the purpose of M. R. Civ. P. 24(d). The Rule intends to allow the Attorney General to intervene in a case where a party challenges the constitutionality of a statute. The Rule served its purpose here. The Attorney General could have intervened had it chosen to do so. The fact that no prejudice accrued to the Attorney General from McKinnon\u2019s allegedly late notice further illustrates that the purpose and spirit of the rule were not violated. The Dissent would have us apply the rule without regard to its intended purpose. This approach ignores the fact that \u201cthis Court has refused to abide by such a strict, formalistic approach to statutory interpretation and ha[s] readily applied the maxim \u2018The law respects form less than substance.\u2019\u201d <em>McKirdy v. Vielleux, </em>2000 MT 264, \u00b6 35, 302 MT 18, 19 P.3d 207 (quoting \u00a7 1-3-219, MCA).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">\u00b629 McKinnon also argues that this Court held that substantial compliance with M. R. App. P. 38 proved sufficient where such compliance allowed the Attorney General an opportunity to respond to the constitutional challenge. <em>See U.S. Mfg. &amp; Distrib. Corp. v. Great Falls, </em>169 Mont. 298, 302, 546 P.2d 522, 524-25 (1976). We must agree with McKinnon based on the fact that the Attorney General acknowledged proper receipt of notice. M. R. Civ. P. 24(d) seeks to ensure that the Attorney General will have the chance to appear in the district court to defend the constitutionality of a statute in a case in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>which the State is not a party. Nothing prevented the Attorney General from participating in the litigation. The Attorney General\u2019s office acknowledged timely notice and declined to exercise its statutory right to intervene within 20 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">\u00b630  We cannot determine that McKinnon\u2019s notice constituted a failure of a \u201ccondition precedent\u201d as had been the case in <em>Russell. </em>McKinnon complied with the spirit of the rule and no prejudice accrued to the Attorney General due to his allegedly late compliance. Our rules of civil procedure \u201cplace the spirit of the law above strict compliance with the letter of the law.\u201d <em>State Medical Oxygen &amp; Supply v. American Medical Oxygen Co., </em>230 Mont. 456, 462, 750 P.2d 1085, 1089 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">\u00b631 Reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b153-6\">JUSTICES LEAPHART, COTTER and NELSON concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b153-7\">JUSTICE RICE,</author>\n<p id=\"AXQ\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">\u00b632 To state a claim under the exception to the exclusivity provision of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, a complaint must allege that an employer\u2019s or fellow employee\u2019s <em>intentional act </em>caused an <em>intentional injury. </em>Section 39-71-413(1), MCA (2003). Additionally, in order to challenge the constitutionality of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, a plaintiff must \u201ccontemporaneously\u201d notify the Attorney General in writing of the constitutional claim, specifying the section of the code or chapter of the session law being challenged. M. R. Civ. P. 24(d) (2005). McKinnon complied with neither of these requirements. Despite that, the Court reverses both issues. I believe the District Court correctly dismissed McKinnon\u2019s complaint, and therefore dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-9\">\u00b633 In reviewing the District Court\u2019s dismissal of the action, we construe the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. <em>Wise v. CNH America, LLC, </em>2006 MT 194, \u00b6 6, 333 Mont. 181, 142 P.3d 774. A complaint will survive a motion to dismiss only if it \u201cput a defendant on notice of the facts that the plaintiff intends to prove; the facts must disclose the elements necessary to make the claim; and the complaint must demand judgment for relief sought by the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Wise, </em>\u00b6 8 (citing <em>Kunst v. Pass, </em>1998 MT 71, \u00b6 35, 288 Mont. 264, 957 P.2d 1).</p>\n<p id=\"Axo\">\u00b634 A fundamental tenet of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act is the \u201cexclusive\u201d remedy it provides for work-related injuries. Section 39-71-411, MCA. A narrow exception to the Act\u2019s exclusivity is provided when \u201can employee is <em>intentionally injured </em>by an <em>intentional and deliberate act </em>of the employee\u2019s employer or ... a fellow employee ....\u201d Section 39-71-413(1), MCA (emphasis added). \u201cIntentional injury\u201d is defined as \u201can injury caused by an intentional and deliberate act that is <em>specifically and actually intended to cause injury </em>to the employee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>injured and there is actual knowledge that an injury is certain to occur.\u201d Section 39-71-413(3), MCA (emphasis added). Thus, to satisfy the exception, the statute clearly requires that both the <em>act </em>and the resulting <em>injury </em>be specifically and actually intended.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u00b635 The Legislature\u2019s 2001 amendment was not lost upon this Court and, in 2006, we interpreted the statute to mean what it says, holding \u201c[i]n order to state a claim under \u00a7 39-71-413, MCA, an employee must now allege that he or she has been <em>intentionally injured </em>by the <em>intentional act </em>of an employer or fellow employee in order to avoid the exclusivity provision of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.\u201d <em>Wise, </em>\u00b6 12 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">\u00b636 Accepting the allegations of the complaint as true, Count I fails to allege either the element of an intentional act or an intentional injury. McKinnon alleges that: (1) Western Sugar had a \u201cduty\u201d to protect him; (2) Western Sugar \u201cbreach[ed]\u201d that duty by failing to provide him with the appropriate \u201cdirection, supervision, training, and equipment;\u201d (3) Western Sugar \u201ccaused Mr. McKinnon\u2019s injuries;\u201d and (4) \u201cMr. McKinnon has sustained damages.\u201d Thus, McKinnon alleges breach of a duty by Western Sugar which caused him damages. As the District Court correctly recognized, \u201cwithout using the word negligence, McKinnon has alleged a negligence claim against Western Sugar.\u201d <em>See e.g. Peterson v. Eichhorn, </em>2008 MT 250, \u00b6 23, 344 Mont. 540, 189 P.3d 615 (delineating the elements of negligence as duty, breach, cause, and damages) (citing <em>Wilden v. Neumann, </em>2008 MT 236, \u00b6 14, 344 Mont. 407, 189 P.3d 610; <em>Bonilla v. U. of Mont., </em>2005 MT 183, \u00b6 14, 328 Mont. 41, 116 P.3d 823; <em>Massee v. Thompson, </em>2004 MT 121, \u00b6 30, 321 Mont. 210, 90 P.3d 394). The District Court correctly dismissed Count I for failure to state a claim under \u00a7 39-71-411, MCA, precisely as we did in <em>Wise: </em>\u201c[The employer\u2019s] negligent conduct, viewed in a light most favorable to Wise, remains negligent conduct, and does not rise to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>level of an intentional act specifically designed to cause an injury to Wise.\u201d <em>Wise, </em>\u00b6 12 (citing \u00a7 39-71-413, MCA).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">\u00b637 Count II likewise fails to state a claim for which relief may be granted. It restates the allegations of Count I and then adds the following assertions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-5\">[McKinnon] was injured by [Western Sugar\u2019s] intentional and deliberate act of engaging in an ongoing policy and practice of moving rail cars in an uncontrolled manner, without necessary safety equipment, when it knew or should have known that eventual severe injury to [McKinnon] was certain to occur-in that regard, a knowing or intended consequence of its intentional acts. [Western Sugar\u2019s] conduct in this regard caused Mr. McKinnon\u2019s injuries.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-6\">As a direct result of the injuries caused by [Western Sugar\u2019s] conduct as described herein, Mr. McKinnon has sustained damages including past and future lost earnings and capacity; past and future medical expenses; past and future pain and suffering; past and future loss of enjoyment of life.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">Taking these allegations as true, Count II asserts: (1) Western Sugar intentionally and deliberately engaged in an unsafe policy and practice of moving rail cars; (2) Western Sugar lacked appropriate safety equipment; (3) Western Sugar knew or should have known McKinnon would eventually be injured; and (4) McKinnon was injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">\u00b638 Even under the lenient standards of notice pleading, McKinnon has failed to state a claim under \u00a7 39-71-413, MCA. McKinnon\u2019s assertion that Western Sugar intentionally and deliberately \u201cengag[ed] in an ongoing policy and practice\u201d arguably stated an intentional and deliberate <em>act </em>by Western Sugar and, construing the pleading in McKinnon\u2019s favor, I would accept it as such. However, fatal to McKinnon\u2019s claim is his failure to allege that Western Sugar also acted with the specific and actual intention to cause the <em>resulting injury </em>to McKinnon. McKinnon\u2019s complaint merely alleges that Western Sugar \u201cknew or should have known McKinnon would eventually be injured,\u201d which treads nowhere near a claim that his injury was \u201ccaused by an intentional and deliberate act <em>that is specifically and actually intended to cause injury to the employee injured,\u201d </em>as required by \u00a7 39-71-413(3), MCA (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-9\">\u00b639 <em>Larson\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation Law </em>explains regarding the allegations necessary to sustain such intentional claims:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-10\">Even if the alleged conduct goes beyond aggravated negligence, and includes such elements as knowingly permitting a hazardous work condition to exist, knowingly ordering <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>employees to perform an extremely dangerous job, wilfully failing to furnish a safe place to work, wilfully violating a safety statute, failing to protect employees from crime, refusing to respond to an employee\u2019s medical needs and restrictions, or withholding information about worksite hazards, <em>the conduct still falls short of the kind of actual intention to injure that robs the injury of accidental character.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-5\">If [the cases requiring an intent to harm as well as an intent to act] seem rather strict, one must remind oneself that what is being tested here is not the degree of gravity or depravity of the employer\u2019s conduct, but rather the narrow issue of the intentional versus the accidental quality of the precise event producing injury. <em>The intentional removal of a safety device or toleration of a dangerous condition may or may not set the stage for an accidental injury later. But in any normal use of the words, it cannot be said, if such an injury does happen, that this was deliberate infliction of harm comparable to an intentional left jab to the chin.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-6\"><em>Larson\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation Law </em>\u00a7 103.03 (Rev. ed., Matthew Bender Supp. 2009) (footnotes omitted, emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">\u00b640 McKinnon has pled exactly what <em>Larson </em>explains is insufficient to satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 39-71-413, MCA-that Western Sugar intentionally and deliberately implemented a dangerous work condition that Western Sugar knew or should have known would eventually cause an injury. These allegations do not contain a \u201cspecific and actual\u201d intent to injure and are therefore insufficient as a matter of law. Although the Court reasons that \u201cMcKinnon specifically alleges that Western Sugar\u2019s conduct fit within the exception to Worker\u2019s Compensation exclusivity at \u00a7 39-71-413, MCA,\u201d this is the precise tactic we rejected in <em>Wise: </em>\u201cWise\u2019s attempt to characterize negligent conduct as \u2018intentional and deliberate\u2019 fails to bring his claim within the ambit of \u00a7 39-71-413, MCA.... [The alleged conduct] does not rise to the level of an intentional act specifically designed to cause an injury to Wise.\u201d Wise, \u00b6 12 (citation omitted). This Court, like other courts, has steadfastly rejected the use of conclusory statements in a pleading in the absence of factual basis. <em>Cowan v. Cowan, </em>2004 MT 97, \u00b6 14, 321 Mont. 13, 89 P.3d 6 (\u201cFacts must be viewed in a light most favorable to the plaintiff, however, the court is under no duty to take as true legal conclusions or allegations that have no factual basis____\u201d) (citation omitted); <em>Ashcroft v. </em>Iqbal,_U.S._, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 1950 (2009) (Courts \u201care not bound to accept as true a legal conclusion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>couched as a factual allegation.\u201d) (citation omitted); <em>Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 1965 (2007) (\u201c[A] pleading must contain something more ... than... a statement of facts that merely creates a suspicion [of] a legally cognizable right of action.\u201d) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">\u00b641 I believe the District Court analyzed this issue correctly.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">\u00b642 Regarding Issue 2, McKinnon filed an amended complaint on July 18, 2008, which contained constitutional challenges to the exclusivity provision. McKinnon did not contemporaneously notify the Attorney General in writing of his claim when he filed his pleading. McKinnon served the amended complaint upon Western Sugar on or around September 11, 2008. On October 1, 2008, Western Sugar moved to dismiss McKinnon\u2019s constitutional claims for failure to serve the Attorney General as required by M. R. Civ. P. 24(d). McKinnon then provided written notice to the Attorney General on October 7, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"ACi\">\u00b643 M. R. Civ. P. 24(d) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-7\">When the constitutionality of any act of the Montana legislature is drawn in question in any action, suit or proceeding to which neither the state nor any agency or any officer or employee thereof, as such officer or employee, is a party, the party raising the constitutionality of the act shall notify the Montana attorney general and the court of the constitutional issue. The notice shall be in writing, shall specify the section of the code or chapter of the session law to be construed and <em>shall be given contemporaneously with the filing of the pleading or other document in which the constitutional issue is raised. </em>The attorney general may within 20 days thereafter intervene as provided in Rule 24(c) on behalf of the state.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">(Emphasis added.) Although we have not yet addressed this provision, this issue is not one of first impression. We interpreted former M. R. App. P. 38,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> a rule very similar to M. R. Civ. P. 24(d), in <em>Russell v. Masonic Home of Montana, Inc., </em>2006 MT 286, \u00b6 20, 334 Mont. 351, 147 P.3d 216. M. R. App. P. 38 similarly provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-9\">It shall be the duty of a party who challenges the constitutionality of any act of the Montana legislature in any action, suit or proceeding in the supreme court to which neither the state nor any agency or any officer or employee thereof, as such officer or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>employee, is a party, to give notice to the supreme court and to the Montana attorney general of the existence of the constitutional issue. This notice shall be in writing, shall specify the section of the code or chapter of the session law to be construed and <em>shall be given contemporaneously with the filing of the notice of appeal or with the filing of an original proceeding in the supreme court.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">(Emphasis added.) We held in <em>Russell </em>that the requirement of \u201ccontemporaneously\u201d providing notice to the Attorney General was \u201can essential condition precedent.\u201d <em>Russell, </em>\u00b6 20. Because Russell had not \u201ccontemporaneously\u201d notified the Attorney General of her appeal, we concluded that M. R. App. P. 38 prohibited this Court from addressing her constitutional claims. <em>Russell, </em>\u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">\u00b644 Now, despite the same language as <em>in Russell </em>being at issue, and the same facts-that the litigant has failed to \u201ccontemporaneously\u201d provide notice to the Attorney General-the Court reaches a completely different result under M. R. Civ. P. 24(d). The Court saves McKinnon\u2019s constitutional claims by reasoning that \u201cthe purpose and spirit of the rule were not violated.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 28. However, the \u201cpurpose and spirit\u201d offered by the Court contradicts the plain wording of the rule. <em>See Russell, </em>\u00b6 22; \u00a7 1-2-101, MCA (\u201c[T]he office of the judge is simply to ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained therein, not to insert what has been omitted <em>or to omit what has been </em>inserted.\u201d (Emphasis added.)). The rule should be followed, or should be repealed, but it should not be ducked. Nor should our precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"AVS\">\u00b645 McKinnon, like Russell, failed to \u201ccontemporaneously\u201d provide written notice to the Attorney General of his constitutional challenge when he filed his pleading. I believe the District Court correctly analyzed this issue as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">\u00b646 I would affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b154-5\"> The requirement of specific intent for both the act and the resulting injury is a high standard, but when viewed in its historical context, was one clearly intended by the Legislature. In 1971, this Court <em>decided Enberg v. Anaconda Co., </em>158 Mont. 135, 137, 489 P.2d 1036, 1037 (1971), requiring the pleading of an intentional injury in addition to an intentional act. The exclusivity statute then went through various revisions, <em>see e.g. </em>\u00a7 92-204, RCM (1973) and \u00a7 92-204.1, RCM (1977), before its recodification at \u00a7 39-71-413, MCA (1978). The 1978 version of the statute remained in effect until 2001, when it was revised in response to this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Sherner v. Conoco, Inc., </em>2000 MT 50, 298 Mont. 401, 995 P.2d 990, which concluded that the provision did not require an intent to cause the resulting injury. <em>See Sherner, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 38-39. In response, the Legislature amended the statute to require a specific intent for both the act and the resulting injury. SB 323, 57th Leg., Reg. Sess. (Apr. 12, 2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b157-10\"> M.R.App.P. 38 was revised and renumbered to M.R.App.P. 27.
