We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-12\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b542-13\">\u00b62 Scheffer raises three issues on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-14\">1. Did the District Court err in denying Scheffer\u2019s motion to suppress?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-15\">2. Did the District Court abuse its discretion in denying Scheffer\u2019s motion to dismiss the Amended Information?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-16\">3. Must Scheffer\u2019s conviction of attempted tampering with or fabricating physical evidence be vacated as \u201cirrationally inconsistent\u201d with his acquittal of sexual intercourse without consent?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>GENERAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">\u00b63 Shortly after midnight on August 25,2007, Missoula County 9-1-1 received a report that Scheffer had attempted to rape a woman (whom we refer to herein as \u201cH.K.\u201d) earlier that evening outside Larry\u2019s Six Mile tavern in Huson, Montana.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Officers from the Missoula County Sheriffs Department responded to H.K\u2019s location to interview her and other individuals who had observed H.K\u2019s demeanor following the incident. H.K. told the officers that she had gone to Larry\u2019s Six Mile at around 10:00 that evening and, while there, had gotten into a conversation with Scheffer about Corvettes. According to H.K., Scheffer invited her outside to look at his Corvette Stingray and, at some point while they were outside, tried to kiss her. H.K. pulled away but Scheffer grabbed one of her arms. This caused her to fall to the ground with Scheffer on top of her. H.K. stated that he tried to pull up her shirt, but she resisted. Scheffer then moved one of his hands down the front of her pants and inside her underwear and inserted one or more of his fingers inside her vagina. H.K. said she then kicked Scheffer in order to get away.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">\u00b64 After interviewing H.K., a deputy transported her to First Step in Missoula for a medical examination while two other officers attempted to locate Scheffer. They found him sitting in his Corvette with an unidentified female in the parking lot of Larry\u2019s Six Mile just after closing. The officers approached the car and asked Scheffer if he would speak with them. Scheffer agreed, and they walked over to Deputy Jon Gunter\u2019s patrol car. Initially, Scheffer was very cooperative, but he soon became defensive. When Gunter stated that he wanted to ask Scheffer about H.K., Scheffer preemptively exclaimed, \u201cI didn\u2019t touch her.\u201d Sergeant Anthony Rio then read Scheffer his rights under <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S. Ct. 1602 (1966), and Scheffer stated that he would speak with Rio and answer questions. Scheffer explained that the reason H.K. was upset and \u201cfreaked out\u201d was because she had lost her purse. Scheffer stated that he had helped her find it. Rio noted that Scheffer\u2019s speech was slurred, his breath smelled of alcohol, and he rambled quite a bit during the interview, which took place over the course of 10 to 20 minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>\u00b65 Meanwhile, roughly 30 people were milling about in the parking lot, some jeering at the officers and others coming over to listen to the interview with Scheffer. These distractions were making it difficult to have a conversation, so Sergeant Rio suggested that Scheffer come down to the sheriffs office and give his statement there. Scheffer agreed; however, due to his intoxicated condition and the fact that he was a suspect, the officers patted him down, handcuffed him, and put him in the back of the patrol car.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">\u00b66 At the sheriffs office, the officers removed the handcuffs and put Scheffer in an interrogation room, where he was questioned by Detective T.J. McDermott. McDermott observed that Scheffer appeared to be under the influence of alcohol but nevertheless was coherent and able to answer questions throughout the interview, which lasted roughly an hour. The video recording of the interview is contained in the record on appeal. Portions of it were played to the jury at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">\u00b67 Scheffer told McDermott that he and H.K. had been at Scheffer\u2019s shop (which is located adjacent to Larry\u2019s Six Mile tavern) earlier in the evening and that he had kissed H.K. several times there while the two of them were sitting on a couch. He claimed that H.K. had \u201cbegged\u201d him to have sex with her but he had refused because of his friendship with H.K.\u2019s fianc\u00e9. Scheffer emphatically denied touching H.K. (except for kissing her), and he likewise denied putting his hand down her pants and his fingers in her vagina. He suggested a number of times that McDermott bring H.K. and certain other individuals down to the stationhouse in order to clear everything up right then and there.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">\u00b68 In light of H.K\u2019s allegation of digital penetration, McDermott told Scheffer that he wanted to swab Scheffer\u2019s fingers to test for the presence of H.K\u2019s DNA and thereby corroborate Scheffer\u2019s story (assuming the test showed that her DNA was not present). Scheffer consented to this procedure. However, while McDermott was out of the room obtaining the swabbing materials, Scheffer quickly stuck three fingers of his right hand (the index, middle, and ring fingers) entirely in his mouth, moved them back and forth, took them out, rubbed his hands together, and then wiped his fingers on his jeans (all within the span of about six seconds). McDermott and Sergeant Rio observed these actions on a monitor in the hallway. Twenty seconds later, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>Scheffer briefly chewed on his right-hand fingernails.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After McDermott swabbed Scheffer\u2019s fingers, he confronted Scheffer about sticking his fingers in his mouth. Scheffer flatly denied doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">\u00b69 At the conclusion of the interview, McDermott placed Scheffer under arrest. The State subsequently charged him on September 11, 2007, with sexual intercourse without consent, a felony, in violation of \u00a7 45-5-503, MCA (Count I); tampering with or fabricating physical evidence, a felony, in violation of \u00a7 45-7-207, MCA (Count II); and unlawful restraint, a misdemeanor, in violation of \u00a7 45-5-301, MCA (Count III). Scheffer pleaded not guilty to these charges and subsequently filed a motion to suppress his statements and the evidence obtained during the interview with McDermott. He argued that he had requested the presence of counsel but that McDermott had continued to question Scheffer despite this request. The District Court reviewed the video recording and thereafter denied Scheffer\u2019s motion, concluding that he had not actually invoked his right to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">\u00b610 On May 21, 2008 (seven days before trial), the State requested leave to file an Amended Information under \u00a7 46-11-205, MCA. The prosecutor explained that when the original Information was filed, the crime lab had not yet completed testing of the swabs of Scheffer\u2019s fingers; however, the testing had since been completed, and it revealed the presence of both Scheffer\u2019s DNA and H.K\u2019s DNA. The prosecutor thus asserted that Scheffer had \u201cattempted to destroy the evidence, but was not successful,\u201d and she sought to amend Count II to allege <em>attempted </em>tampering with or fabricating physical evidence, a felony, in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 45-4-103 and 45-7-207, MCA. The District Court granted the motion over Scheffer\u2019s objections that the amendment was untimely and the supporting affidavit was invalid. Scheffer entered a plea of not guilty to the amended charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">\u00b611 A four-day jury trial commenced on May 28, 2008. Scheffer testified in his own defense. Contrary to what he had told Detective McDermott, Scheffer stated that when he and H.K. were on the couch in his shop, he put his hand in her pants and she put her hand in his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>pants. He further admitted that he put his fingers into her vagina, but he claimed that he did so with H.K\u2019s consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">\u00b612 The jury ultimately found Scheffer not guilty of sexual intercourse without consent and unlawful restraint, but found him guilty of attempted tampering with or fabricating physical evidence. The District Court deferred imposition of sentence for a period of three years and imposed a $1,000 fine. Scheffer now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">\u00b613 <em>Issue 1. Did the District Court err in denying Scheffer\u2019s motion to suppress?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">I. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">\u00b614 In reviewing a district court\u2019s ruling on a motion to suppress evidence or statements, we determine whether the court\u2019s underlying findings of fact are clearly erroneous and whether the court\u2019s interpretation and application of the law are correct. <em>State v. Munson, </em>2007 MT 222, \u00b6 18, 339 Mont. 68, 169 P.3d 364; <em>State v. Clark, </em>2008 MT 419, \u00b6 12, 347 Mont. 354, 198 P.3d 809. The court\u2019s findings are clearly erroneous if they are not supported by substantial evidence, if the court has misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or if this Court\u2019s review of the record leaves us with a definite or firm conviction that a mistake has been made. <em>Munson, </em>\u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-9\">II. Legal Basis of Scheffer\u2019s Right-to-Counsel Claim</p>\n<p id=\"AG1\">\u00b615 As noted, Scheffer filed a motion to suppress his statements and the evidence obtained during the interview with McDermott on the ground that he had been denied his right to counsel. According to Scheffer, he made an unambiguous request for counsel, at which point all questioning should have stopped, and because it did not, any evidence obtained from the interrogation should have been suppressed. On appeal, the parties disagree as to which constitutional provisions govern this claim. In fact, Scheffer accuses the District Court and the State of having \u201cconfused\u201d his Fifth Amendment and Sixth Amendment rights. It is necessary at the outset, therefore, before laying out the specific facts underlying Scheffer\u2019s claim, to clarify which right to counsel he was entitled to during the interrogation. \u00b616 There are two distinct rights to counsel recognized under the Constitution. The first is the right to counsel in all criminal prosecutions. This right is expressly recognized by the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which states that \u201c[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right... to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence.\u201d This right is also expressly recognized by Article II, Section 24 of the Montana Constitution, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>states that \u201c[i]n all criminal prosecutions the accused shall have the right to appear and defend in person and by counsel.\u201d The right of the \u201caccused\u201d to the assistance of counsel in all \u201ccriminal prosecutions\u201d is limited by its terms: It does not attach until a prosecution has been commenced, i.e., until adversary judicial criminal proceedings have been initiated, whether by way of formal charge, preliminary hearing, indictment, information, or arraignment. <em>Rothgery v. Gillespie </em>Co., _ U.S. _, 128 S. Ct. 2578, 2583 (2008) (Sixth Amendment); <em>State v. </em>Schneider, 2008 MT 408, \u00b6\u00b6 16-23, 347 Mont. 215, 197 P.3d 1020 (Article II, Section 24). Indeed, the core of this right is \u201ca trial right, ensuring that the prosecution\u2019s case is subjected to the crucible of meaningful adversarial testing.\u201d <em>Kansas v. </em>Ventris, _ U.S. _, 129 S. Ct. 1841, 1845 (2009) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>Schneider, </em>\u00b6 23 (the Article II, Section 24 right to counsel is \u201ca trial-based right\u201d). However, because \u201ctoday\u2019s law enforcement machinery involves critical confrontations of the accused by the prosecution at pretrial proceedings where the results might well settle the accused\u2019s fate and reduce the trial itself to a mere formality,\u201d <em>United States v. Wade, </em>388 U.S. 218, 224, 87 S. Ct. 1926, 1931 (1967), the right to counsel under the Sixth Amendment and Article II, Section 24 extends (once the adversary judicial process has been initiated) to having counsel present at all pretrial \u201ccritical\u201d interactions between the defendant and the State, <em>see id. </em>at 224, 226, 87 S. Ct. at 1931, 1932; <em>Ventris, </em>129 S. Ct. at 1845; <em>Montejo v. </em>Louisiana, _ U.S. _, 129 S. Ct. 2079, 2085 (2009); <em>Maine v. Moulton, </em>474 U.S. 159, 170, 106 S. Ct. 477, 484 (1985); <em>Ranta v. State, </em>1998 MT 95, \u00b6 17, 288 Mont. 391, 958 P.2d 670.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-11\">\u00b617 The second right to counsel recognized under the Constitution derives from the privilege against self-incrimination and applies specifically to custodial interrogations. The Fifth Amendment provides that \u201c[n]o person . . . shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.\u201d Likewise, Article II, Section 25 guarantees that \u201c[n]o person shall be compelled to testify against himself in a criminal proceeding.\u201d In <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S. Ct. 1602 (1966), the Supreme Court held that \u201cthe Fifth Amendment privilege is available outside of criminal court proceedings and serves to protect persons in all settings in which their freedom of action is curtailed in any significant way from being compelled to incriminate themselves.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 467, 86 S. Ct. at 1624. Furthermore, because the modern practice of in-custody interrogation \u201ccontains inherently compelling pressures which work to undermine the individual\u2019s will to resist and to compel him to speak where he would not otherwise do so freely,\u201d the Supreme Court concluded that \u201cadequate protective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>devices\u201d are necessary to dispel the compulsion inherent in custodial surroundings and to permit a full opportunity to exercise the privilege against self-incrimination. <em>Id. </em>at 458, 467, 86 S. Ct. at 1619, 1624; <em>see also Dickerson v. United States, </em>530 U.S. 428, 434-35, 120 S. Ct. 2326, 2331 (2000); <em>State v. Morrisey, </em>2009 MT 201, \u00b6\u00b6 27-28, 351 Mont. 144, 214 P.3d 708. One of the protective devices recognized by the Court is the right of the individual to consult with a lawyer and to have the lawyer present with him during the custodial interrogation. <em>See Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 471, 474, 86 S. Ct. at 1626, 1628; <em>see also Montejo, </em>129 S. Ct. at 2089 (\u201cUnder <em>Miranda\u2019s </em>prophylactic protection of the right against compelled self-incrimination, any suspect subject to custodial interrogation has the right to have a lawyer present if he so requests, and to be advised of that right.\u201d). The <em>Miranda </em>Court explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-4\">[t]he circumstances surrounding in-custody interrogation can operate very quickly to overbear the will of one merely made aware of his privilege [against self-incrimination] by his interrogators. Therefore, the right to have counsel present at the interrogation is indispensable to the protection of the Fifth Amendment privilege under the system we delineate today. Our aim is to assure that the individual\u2019s right to choose between silence and speech remains unfettered throughout the interrogation process.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">384 U.S. at 469, 86 S. Ct. at 1625. Once an individual has invoked his or her right to have counsel present during custodial interrogation, the interrogation must cease and officials may not reinitiate interrogation without counsel present. <em>See Edwards v. Arizona, </em>451 U.S. 477, 484-85, 101 S. Ct. 1880, 1884-85 (1981); <em>Minnick v. Mississippi, </em>498 U.S. 146, 153, 111 S. Ct. 486, 491 (1990). Although the <em>Miranda </em>right to counsel derives from the Fifth Amendment, we have indicated, both implicitly and explicitly, that the rights and procedures dictated by <em>Miranda </em>are required by Article II, Section 25 of the Montana Constitution as well. <em>See e.g. Schneider, </em>\u00b6 27; <em>State v. Hurlbert, </em>2009 MT 221, \u00b6 33, 351 Mont. 316, 211 P.3d 869; <em>State v. Buck, </em>2006 MT 81, \u00b6\u00b6 45-48, 331 Mont. 517, 134 P.3d 53; <em>State </em>v. <em>Olson, </em>2003 MT 61, \u00b6\u00b6 13-14, 314 Mont. 402, 66 P.3d 297.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">\u00b618 The policies and interests underlying these two rights are distinct, <em>see Patterson v. Illinois, </em>487 U.S. 285, 297, 108 S. Ct. 2389, 2397 (1988), as are the applicable standards, <em>see e.g. Fellers v. United States, </em>540 U.S. 519, 524, 124 S. Ct. 1019, 1022-23 (2004). The Sixth Amendment/Article II, Section 24 right to counsel, applicable throughout the course of a criminal prosecution, protects \u201cthe unaided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>layman at critical confrontations with his expert adversary, the government, <em>after </em>the adverse positions of government and defendant have solidified with respect to a particular alleged crime.\u201d <em>McNeil v. Wisconsin, </em>501 U.S. 171, 177-78, 111 S. Ct. 2204, 2208-09 (1991) (internal quotation marks omitted). This right is thus offense specific. <em>Id. </em>at 175, 111 S. Ct. at 2207; <em>Schneider, </em>\u00b6 23. In contrast, the Fifth Amendment/Article II, Section 25 right to counsel, applicable during a custodial interrogation, protects \u201cthe suspect\u2019s desire to deal with the police only through counsel.\u201d <em>McNeil, </em>501 U.S. at 178, 111 S. Ct. at 2209 (internal quotation marks omitted). This right is thus <em>not </em>offense specific, and \u201c[o]nce a suspect invokes the <em>Miranda </em>right to counsel for interrogation regarding one offense, he may not be reapproached regarding <em>any </em>offense unless counsel is present.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 177, 111 S. Ct. at 2208; <em>see also Arizona v. Roberson, </em>486 U.S. 675, 108 S. Ct. 2093 (1988). Hence, the interest protected by the Fifth Amendment guarantee \u201cis in one respect narrower than the interest protected by the Sixth Amendment guarantee (because it relates only to custodial interrogation) and in another respect broader (because it relates to interrogation regarding <em>any </em>suspected crime and attaches whether or not the \u2018adversarial relationship\u2019 produced by a pending prosecution has yet arisen).\u201d <em>McNeil, </em>501 U.S. at 178, 111 S. Ct. at 2209. It is worth noting that <em>both </em>rights to counsel may be applicable in certain situations-for example, at a postarraignment custodial interrogation. <em>See Montejo, </em>129 S. Ct. at 2090; <em>Michigan v. Jackson, </em>475 U.S. 625, 629, 106 S. Ct. 1404, 1407 (1986), <em>overruled on other grounds, Montejo, </em>129 S. Ct. at 2091.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\">\u00b619 In addition to the foregoing distinctions, the consequences of violating the two rights differ in some important respects (at least insofar as federal law is concerned). The privilege against self-incrimination protects a person \u201conly from being compelled to testify against himself, or otherwise provide the State with evidence of a testimonial or communicative nature.\u201d <em>Pennsylvania v. Muniz, </em>496 U.S. 582, 589, 110 S. Ct. 2638, 2643 (1990) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also Oregon v. Elstad, </em>470 U.S. 298, 304, 105 S. Ct. 1285, 1290 (1985) (\u201cThe Fifth Amendment, of course, is not concerned with nontestimonial evidence.\u201d); <em>State v. Devlin, </em>1999 MT 90, 294 Mont. 215, 980 P.2d 1037. The <em>Miranda </em>safeguards, in turn, serve to protect the privilege by requiring that when a person is in custody, he must be warned prior to any questioning that he has the right to remain silent, that anything he says can be used against him in a court of law, that he has the right to the presence of an attorney, and that if he cannot afford an attorney one will be appointed for him prior to any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>questioning if he so desires. <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 478-79, 86 S. Ct. at 1630; <em>State v. Buck, </em>2006 MT 81, \u00b6\u00b6 35, 45, 331 Mont. 517, 134 P.3d 53. Failure to give these warnings and obtain a valid waiver of rights prior to questioning, or failure to fully honor the exercise of these rights throughout the interrogation, generally requires the exclusion of any <em>testimonial </em>evidence (i.e., communications) obtained. <em>See Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 467, 476, 479, 86 S. Ct. at 1624, 1629, 1630; <em>State v. Morrisey, </em>2009 MT 201, \u00b6 28, 351 Mont. 144, 214 P.3d 708. However, the Supreme Court has refused to apply the fruit-of-the-poisonous-tree doctrine<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to exclude <em>derivative </em>evidence (i.e., evidence discovered as a result of a statement obtained in violation of <em>Miranda).</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> See United States v. Patane, </em>542 U.S. 630, 124 S. Ct. 2620 (2004); <em>see also Elstad, </em>470 U.S. 298, 105 S. Ct. 1285 (rejecting application of the fruits doctrine to a second confession that followed a first confession obtained in violation of <em>Miranda); Missouri v. Seibert, </em>542 U.S. 600, 124 S. Ct. 2601 (2004) (again declining to apply the fruits doctrine to a second confession); Wayne R. LaFave et al., <em>Criminal Procedure </em>vol. 3, \u00a7 9.5(a)-(c), 466-82 (3d ed., West 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">\u00b620 In contrast, the Sixth Amendment right to counsel is not a \u201cprotective device\u201d that functions solely as a safeguard against compelled self-incrimination. Indeed, \u201cthe Sixth Amendment\u2019s protection of the attorney-client relationship-the right to rely on counsel as a \u2018medium\u2019 between [the accused] and the State-extends beyond Miranda\u2019s protection of the Fifth Amendment right to counsel.\u201d <em>Patterson, </em>487 U.S. at 296 n. 9, 108 S. Ct. at 2397 n. 9 (brackets in <em>Patterson, </em>some internal quotation marks omitted). The Sixth Amendment right to counsel is specifically affirmed in the Constitution, and it broadly guarantees an accused \u201caid in coping with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>legal problems or assistance in meeting his adversar/\u2019 (the government) at critical stages of the criminal proceedings. <em>United States v. Ash, </em>413 U.S. 300, 310-11, 313, 93 S. Ct. 2568, 2574, 2575 (1973). It also protects the integrity and fairness of the adversary criminal process. <em>See Lockhart v. Fretwell, </em>506 U.S. 364, 368-69, 113 S. Ct. 838, 842 (1993); <em>Nix v. Williams, </em>467 U.S. 431, 446, 104 S. Ct. 2501, 2510 (1984). It thus is not limited to testimonial evidence, and the fruits doctrine applies to Sixth Amendment violations. <em>See e.g. Brewer v. Williams, </em>430 U.S. 387, 406 n. 12, 97 S. Ct. 1232, 1243 n. 12 (1977) (due to Sixth Amendment violation, neither the defendant\u2019s incriminating statements nor any testimony describing his having led the police to the victim\u2019s body was admissible); <em>Nix, </em>467 U.S. at 441-50, 104 S. Ct. at 2507-12 (in the context of a Sixth Amendment violation, acknowledging the fruits doctrine and applying the inevitable-discovery exception to it); <em>Wade, </em>388 U.S. at 239-42, 87 S. Ct. at 1939-40 (evidence based on identification made at postindictment lineup, in violation of the accused\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to counsel, is inadmissible); <em>accord Gilbert v. California, </em>388 U.S. 263, 272-74, 87 S. Ct. 1951, 1956-57 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">\u00b621 Recognizing these distinctions, Scheffer insists that his right-to-counsel claim is governed by the Sixth Amendment and Article II, Section 24. As noted, he was acquitted of sexual intercourse without consent and unlawful restraint, but was found guilty of attempted tampering with or fabricating physical evidence. The primary evidence obtained from the interrogation and introduced at trial to prove this charge did not consist of testimonial statements given by Scheffer, but rather consisted of the videotape recording of what Scheffer did \u00absticking his fingers in his mouth) and the testimony of Detective McDermott and Sergeant Rio about what they witnessed through the hallway monitor (Scheffer sticking his fingers in his mouth). For the reasons discussed above, Scheffer faces significant obstacles to suppressing this evidence under a Fifth Amendment/Article II, Section 25 theory. Thus, Scheffer cites the Sixth Amendment, Article II, Section 24, and <em>Wade, </em>388 U.S. 218, 87 S. Ct. 1926, in arguing that he is entitled to suppression of his \u201cconduct\u201d because he was questioned in the absence of counsel at a \u201ccritical stage\u201d proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">J22 The State counters that Scheffer\u2019s claim is governed by the Fifth Amendment and Article II, Section 25, not the Sixth Amendment and Article II, Section 24, given that the interrogation was not part of a \u2018judicial proceeding.\u201d In response, Scheffer maintains his Sixth Amendment/Article II, Section 24 argument, but also argues that even f the Fifth Amendment and Article II, Section 25 apply, he had the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>right to have counsel present, this right was infringed, and his motion to suppress should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">\u00b623 The State is correct that the Fifth Amendment and Article II, Section 25 apply to Scheffer\u2019s claim. As explained above, the Sixth Amendment/Article II, Section 24 right to counsel does not attach until adversary judicial criminal proceedings have been initiated, and there is no question that at the time of the McDermott-Scheffer interview, the State had not yet commenced a formal criminal prosecution against Scheffer. <em>See State v. Schneider, </em>2008 MT 408, \u00b6\u00b6 17, 21, 347 Mont. 215, 197 P.3d 1020. Scheffer\u2019s argument to the contrary (that the Sixth Amendment and Article II, Section 24 apply) is based entirely on <em>Escobedo v. Illinois, </em>378 U.S. 478, 84 S. Ct. 1758 (1964). In <em>Escobedo-'which, </em>it should be noted, was decided two years before the Supreme Court issued its decision in Miranda-the defendant (Escobedo) was arrested, taken to police headquarters, and interrogated. Despite his repeated requests to speak to his retained lawyer, he was afforded no opportunity to do so during the course of the interrogation. He ultimately made an incriminating statement. On appeal, the Supreme Court concluded that although the interrogation was conducted <em>before </em>Escobedo was formally indicted, his Sixth Amendment right to counsel nevertheless applied under the particular circumstances. The Court held</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-5\">that where, as here, the investigation is no longer a general inquiry into an unsolved crime but has begun to focus on a particular suspect, the suspect has been taken into police custody, the police carry out a process of interrogations that lends itself to eliciting incriminating statements, the suspect has requested and been denied an opportunity to consult with his lawyer, and the police have not effectively warned him of his absolute constitutional right to remain silent, the accused has been denied \u201cthe Assistance of Counsel\u201d in violation of the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b552-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 490-91, 84 S. Ct. at 1765. In short, \u201cwhen the process shifts from investigatory to accusatory-when its focus is on the accused and its purpose is to elicit a confession-our adversary system begins to operate, and, under the circumstances here, the accused must be permitted to consult with his lawyer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 492, 84 S. Ct. at 1766. Relying on this holding, Scheffer argues that McDermott\u2019s interrogation of him \u201cwas an accusatory process rather than a general investigation,\u201d that he was \u201can accused rather than a mere suspect,\u201d that \u201cthe underlying purpose of the interrogation was to get [him] to confess his guilt,\u201d and that \u201cthe \u2018guiding hand of counsel\u2019 was essential\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>to advise him of his rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\">\u00b624  What Scheffer doggedly fails to accept, however, in the face of contrary authority cited by the State, is that subsequent decisions of the Supreme Court</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-5\">foreclose any reliance on <em>Escobedo </em>... for the proposition that the Sixth Amendment right, in any of its manifestations, applies prior to the initiation of adversary judicial proceedings. Although <em>Escobedo </em>was originally decided as a Sixth Amendment case, the Court in retrospect perceived that the prime purpose of <em>Escobedo </em>was not to vindicate the constitutional right to counsel as such, but, like <em>Miranda, </em>to guarantee full effectuation of the privilege against self-incrimination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b553-6\"><em>Moran v. Burbine, </em>475 U.S. 412, 429, 106 S. Ct. 1135, 1145 (1986) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>accord United States v. Gouveia, </em>467 U.S. 180, 188 n. 5, 104 S. Ct. 2292, 2297 n. 5 (1984) (\u201c[W]e required counsel in . . . <em>Escobedo </em>in order to protect the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination rather than to vindicate the Sixth Amendment right to counsel.\u201d). While Scheffer still insists that <em>Escobedo </em>permits application of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel \u201cin certain instances\u201d before adversary judicial criminal proceedings have been initiated, the Supreme Court has stated otherwise, <em>see Moran, </em>475 U.S. at 429, 106 S. Ct. at <em>1145; Rothgery, </em>128 S. Ct. at 2583 (\u201cThe Sixth Amendment right of the accused to assistance of counsel in all criminal prosecutions . . . does not attach until a prosecution is commenced.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)), and Scheffer\u2019s argument, therefore, is simply wrong. Accordingly, we conclude that his Sixth Amendment right to counsel had not arisen at the time of the interrogation, which occurred <em>before </em>Scheffer was formally charged, <em>see State v. Reavley, </em>2003 MT 298, \u00b6\u00b6 37-45, 318 Mont. 150, 79 P.3d 270, and we reach the same conclusion under Article II, Section 24, <em>see Schneider, </em>\u00b6 23 (\u201c[T]he Montana right applies with respect to an offense <em>when prosecution has been commenced </em>for that offense.\u201d (emphasis added)). We are left, then, with the question of whether Scheffer\u2019s right to counsel under the Fifth Amendment and Article II, Section 25 was violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">III. The Merits of Scheffer\u2019s Right-to-Counsel Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">\u00b625 Initially, we note that there is no dispute that the McDermott-Scheffer interview constituted a \u201ccustodial interrogation\u201d and, consequently, that Scheffer had the right to counsel under the Fifth Amendment and Article II, Section 25. The State contends, however, that he did not adequately assert this right and that the right, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>therefore, was not violated. Alternatively, the State contends that even if the right was violated, the exclusionary rule does not apply to evidence of criminal conduct (here, Scheffer\u2019s attempting to tamper with physical evidence on his fingers) committed in response to a claimed constitutional violation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Scheffer disputes the State\u2019s arguments on both points; however, because we agree with the State\u2019s first argument, we do not reach the second.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">\u00b626 If a suspect knowingly and voluntarily waives his right to counsel after receiving the <em>Miranda </em>warnings (as Scheffer concedes he did here), law enforcement officers are free to question him. <em>Davis v. United States, </em>512 U.S. 452, 458, 114 S. Ct. 2350, 2354 (1994). But if the suspect later requests counsel at any time during the interview, he is not subject to further questioning regarding any offense unless an attorney is actually present or the suspect himself reinitiates conversation. <em>Id. </em>at 458, 114 S. Ct. at 2354-55. The question here is whether Scheffer actually invoked his right to counsel after initially waiving it. This is an objective inquiry, <em>id. </em>at 458-59, 114 S. Ct. at 2355, and the Supreme Court has said that in this situation (i.e., after the suspect has waived the <em>Miranda </em>rights), a request for counsel must be \u201cclear\u201d and \u201cunambiguous,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 459, 461, 114 S. Ct. at 2355, 2356. Of course, he \u201cneed not \u2018speak with the discrimination of an Oxford don.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 459, 114 S. Ct. at 2355. As we have noted before, laypeople are not learned in constitutional principle or legal nicety, and to require that precise words be uttered would elevate form over substance. <em>State v. Morrisey, </em>2009 MT 201, \u00b6 40, 351 Mont. 144, 214 P.3d 708. But, \u201che must articulate his desire to have counsel present sufficiently clearly that a reasonable police officer in the circumstances would understand the statement to be a request for an attorney.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>512 U.S. at 459, 114 S. Ct. at 2355. If the suspect \u201cmakes a reference to an attorney that is ambiguous or equivocal in that a reasonable officer in light of the circumstances would have understood only that the suspect <em>might </em>be invoking the right to counsel,\u201d the officer is not required to cease questioning. <em>Id. </em>It is \u201cgood police practice,\u201d however, for the interviewing officer to clarify whether or not the suspect actually wants an attorney. <em>See id. </em>at 461, 114 S. Ct. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>2356; <em>Morrisey, </em>\u00b6 41 n. 8. Indeed, \u201ccustodial officers who press on with questioning assuming that a suspect\u2019s statements or conduct are <em>not </em>indications of the suspect\u2019s desire to retain his Fifth Amendment rights do so at the risk of suppression of the suspect\u2019s subsequent statements.\u201d <em>United States v. Plugh, </em>576 F.3d 135, 141 (2d Cir. 2009); <em>see also Davis, </em>512 U.S. at 461, 114 S. Ct. at 2356 (\u201cClarifying questions help protect the rights of the suspect by ensuring that he gets an attorney if he wants one, and will minimize the chance of a confession being suppressed due to subsequent judicial second-guessing as to the meaning of the suspect\u2019s statement regarding counsel.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\">\u00b627 These principles, of course, are based on the Fifth Amendment. With respect to invoking the Article II, Section 25 right to counsel in custodial interrogations, this Court has stated that \u201cwe refuse to \u2018march lock-step\u2019 with the United States Supreme Court when the provisions of the Montana Constitution call for greater protection of an individual\u2019s rights than that guaranteed by the United States Constitution.\u201d <em>State v. Spang, </em>2002 MT 120, \u00b6 22, 310 Mont. 52, 48 P.3d 727 (citing <em>State v. Johnson, </em>221 Mont. 503, 512, 719 P.2d 1248, 1254 (1986)); <em>see also State v. Buck, </em>2006 MT 81, \u00b6\u00b6 45-48, 331 Mont. 517, 134 P.3d 53 (clarifying that <em>Spang </em>and <em>Johnson </em>involved the right to counsel under Article II, Section 25, not Article II, Section 24, and stating that invocation of this right \u201cdepends on the evident purpose of the suspect\u2019s statement, as viewed in light of the circumstances and in light of the rule that requests for counsel must be construed broadly\u201d). In <em>Spang, </em>we declined to accept the State\u2019s analysis based on <em>Davis </em>and instead purported to rely on Article II, Section 25 in concluding that the defendant had adequately invoked his right to counsel. <em>See Spang, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 19, 22-25. In the present case, however, while Scheffer cites Article II, Section 25, he offers no argument that his alleged assertion of his right to counsel under this provision, even if inadequate under <em>Davis, </em>was still adequate under <em>Johnson, Spang, </em>and <em>Buck. </em>Accordingly, we limit our analysis to the standards set forth in <em>Davis </em>and recited above.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">\u00b628 It is appropriate at this juncture to lay out the relevant portions of the colloquy between Detective McDermott and Scheffer. At the outset of the interview, McDermott introduced himself and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on tonight?\u201d Scheffer responded, \u201cI don\u2019t [expletive] know what the deal is here.\u201d Scheffer then proceeded to explain that he knew H.K., her family, and her fianc\u00e9. McDermott interrupted, however, in order to read Scheffer the <em>Miranda </em>warnings. The following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>McDermott: Hold on real quick, though, okay?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-4\">Scheffer: Sure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-5\">McDermott: There\u2019s a form that I just need to go over with you real quick-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-6\">Scheffer: Sure. No problem.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-7\">McDermott: -just uh-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ADp\">Scheffer: You bet. No problem.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-8\">McDermott: -before we get started. It\u2019s just-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-9\">Scheffer: I don\u2019t care. I mean, I don\u2019t need an attorney or nothing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-10\">[Inaudible.] Read me my rights. I don\u2019t care.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-11\">McDermott: I just have a form, you know?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-12\">Scheffer: Sure. No problem. You bet.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-13\">McDermott: That way, my boss will be happy. So-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aco\">Scheffer: Yeah, yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-14\">McDermott: Let me just read this for you, okay?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-15\">Scheffer: Sure. Go ahead.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-16\">McDermott: Just kind of a standard deal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-17\">Scheffer: But could you do something for me?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b556-18\">At this point, Scheffer asked McDermott to bring H.K. to the stationhouse in order to \u201cclear everything up.\u201d Scheffer claimed that H.K. presently was with a guy doing drugs and that Scheffer knew how to reach her. McDermott responded, \u201cOkay. Well, let me get through this, then we\u2019ll talk about that.\u201d The dialogue continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A3L\">McDermott: So, anyway, these are your Miranda warnings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AS0\">Scheffer: Sure. No problem.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-19\">McDermott: They state you have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-20\">Scheffer: So should I remain silent, or should I stand up for myself?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-21\">McDermott: Tommy, let me get through this, okay, then I\u2019ll answer any questions for you. Just let me read through this first.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Azn\">Scheffer: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-22\">McDermott: So again, you do have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to speak to a lawyer and have your lawyer present before this interview proceeds. If you are unable to pay for a lawyer, the court will appoint one for you at public expense before this interview continues. And should you decide to cooperate in this interview, you still have the right to stop at any time, okay, and then request to have a lawyer present with you before you participate any further. So, do you understand your <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>rights?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-4\">Scheffer: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-5\">McDermott: Okay. So if you could just sign here, this is just a record. It protects you, it protects me, that I did my job and treated you right. Can you date it for me? Just put the 25th. I just want to make sure I treat you right tonight, okay? So, I do not know much about what\u2019s going on. I\u2019ll certainly look into some of these other things you have, but let\u2019s just start with what happened tonight. That\u2019s probably the best-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A2j\">Scheffer: Let me start here.

Let\u2019s get Bobby here, her fianc\u00e9 here. Tell him what really happened.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-20\">McDermott: Okay. But don\u2019t you think it\u2019d be wiser if I talked to you first so that I know the story?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-21\">Scheffer: No, not really.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-22\">McDermott: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-23\">Scheffer: Let\u2019s get my lawyer here. This is, I mean, I\u2019m, this is, you guys should never have brought me down here. I\u2019ve done nothing but found her purse. She gave her car to a friend. I wasn\u2019t gonna let her car get wrecked. I talked her into going to get her car. I found her [purse], and she freaked out because she didn\u2019t have Bobby and hers credit cards. [Inaudible] people she didn\u2019t <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>know. I went and got that, gave it to, I did nothing but help her. And she wanted to fuck, she wanted to do this. She\u2019d been on drugs all night last night. Find her, I can take you to my house and show you the guy she\u2019s with right now, who she did drugs with all night last night. You can call that number. I\u2019ll guarantee that\u2019s who she\u2019s with now. That\u2019s what she wanted to go do.

Yet, while Scheffer did indeed mention a \u201clawyer\u201d several times, we cannot agree that a reasonable officer in the circumstances would have understood his statements to be a request for an attorney (in the sense that he wanted to deal with McDermott only through counsel). In this regard, while Scheffer isolates specific passages from the transcript, it is important to note that \u201cour analysis does not end with words alone;... we also consider the circumstances in which the statement was made.\u201d <em>United States v. Shabaz, </em>579 F.3d 815, 819 (7th Cir. 2009). Doing so, we agree with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>District Court\u2019s assessment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-4\">[Scheffer] here had no intention to invoke his right to counsel, but rather had an overwhelming desire to explain his version of what happened no matter what. It appears to the Court that [Scheffer] believed he could talk his way out of the situation and very much wanted the chance to do so. As a part of this course of action, the mention of a lawyer was a part of [Scheffer\u2019s] early-on suggestion to the officer that he immediately assemble everybody that might have any relationship to the matter under investigation, including his lawyer, and get to the bottom of it right then and there. In the face of [Scheffer\u2019s] eagerness to talk[,] Detective McDermott showed much restraint in trying to slow him down and doing exactly what the Montana and United States Supreme Courts require. He clarified if [Scheffer\u2019s] equivocal statements were a request for a lawyer. They were not.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">\u00b630 We addressed a similar scenario in <em>State v. Maestas, </em>2006 MT 101, 332 Mont. 140, 136 P.3d 514. The defendant (Maestas), immediately after demanding an attorney, and without interruption, told the detective to question another witness about the events in question: \u201cNow, give me a fucking lawyer \u2018cause I don\u2019t have to sit here and fucking put up with this bullshit, \u2018cause I ain\u2019t done nothin\u2019. You can ask Jim, the owner, what time we left.\u201d The detective immediately instructed Maestas to stop talking and tell him whether he wished to have counsel present before proceeding. He asked Maestas at least six times whether he wanted an attorney, and Maestas repeatedly told him that he did not. <em>See Maestas, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 6, 18. We concluded under these circumstances that Maestas\u2019 requests for a lawyer were equivocal and that it was appropriate for the detective to determine what Maestas truly wanted. <em>Maestas, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 18-19.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">\u00b631 In the present case, while Scheffer asserts that his supposed requests for counsel were met with \u201ccoercive responses\u201d and \u201cinterview tactics,\u201d the fact is that McDermott was simply attempting to respond to Scheffer\u2019s various questions and suggestions-obviously a difficult task, given Scheffer\u2019s repeated interruptions. Moreover, Scheffer\u2019s references to a \u201clawyer\u201d were equivocal at best, given his initial statement that \u201cI don\u2019t need an attorney or nothing,\u201d followed closely thereafter by his remarks that \u201cMaybe I should call my lawyer\u201d and his suggestions that they bring various people (including his lawyer) down to the stationhouse to clear everything up. <em>Cf. Davis, </em>512 U.S. at 462, 114 S. Ct. at 2357 (\u201cMaybe I should talk to a lawyer\u201d is not an unambiguous request for counsel). As noted, if a suspect makes a reference to an attorney that is ambiguous or equivocal, in that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>reasonable officer in light of the circumstances would have understood only that the suspect <em>might </em>be invoking the right to counsel, the officer is not required to cease questioning. The prudent course of action, though, is for the officer to clarify whether the suspect actually wants an attorney. And that is what McDermott did. He told Scheffer: \u201cWell, Tommy, the question is you need to decide if you want to talk to me about this or if you want to talk to a lawyer.\u201d Scheffer responded: \u201cWhat do you wanna ask me, and I\u2019ll just tell you what I wanna, if I wanna talk to a lawyer or not. . . .\u201d The conversation proceeded from there, without Scheffer ever stating that he wanted to talk to a lawyer. He later engaged in the conduct that formed the basis of the attempted-tampering charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">\u00b632  We accordingly hold that Scheffer did not make an unambiguous request for counsel. Hence, the District Court did not err in denying his motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">\u00b633 <em>Issue 2. Did the District Court abuse its discretion in denying Scheffer\u2019s motion to dismiss the Amended Information?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">\u00b634 We review for abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s decision whether to allow the amendment of an information. <em>State v. Wilson, </em>2007 MT 327, \u00b6 19, 340 Mont. 191, 172 P.3d 1264. A court abuses its discretion if it acts arbitrarily without the employment of conscientious judgment or exceeds the bounds of reason, resulting in substantial injustice. <em>State v. Derbyshire, </em>2009 MT 27, \u00b6 19, 349 Mont. 114, 201 P.3d 811.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">\u00b635 As noted, the State charged Scheffer in the Information filed September 11, 2007, with tampering with or fabricating physical evidence, a felony, in violation of \u00a7 45-7-207, MCA (2005). On May 21, 2008, the State requested leave to file an Amended Information changing this charge to <em>attempted </em>tampering with or fabricating physical evidence, a felony, in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 45-4-103 and 45-7-207, MCA<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>. The reason for this amendment was that the testing of the swabs of Scheffer\u2019s fingers by the crime lab, which had not been completed at the time the original Information was filed, had since been completed and revealed the presence of both Scheffer\u2019s DNA and H.K\u2019s DNA, thus indicating that Scheffer had not destroyed this evidence (by sticking his fingers in his mouth during the interrogation), but rather had unsuccessfully attempted to do so. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>prosecutor sought \u201cto conform [the charge] to the evidence in the case.\u201d \u00b636 Scheffer moved to dismiss the tampering and attempted-tampering charges. As to the former, he reasoned that the State\u2019s amendment constituted a tacit admission that it could not prove he had <em>actually </em>tampered with physical evidence. As to the latter, he argued that the Amended Information was untimely under \u00a7 46-11-205(1), MCA, which states that the trial court may allow an information to be amended in matters of substance at any time, \u201cbut not less than 5 days before trial.\u201d The District Court denied Scheffer\u2019s motion, concluding that the Amended Information was filed in a timely manner and that Scheffer had not been prejudiced by the amendment of the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">\u00b637 On appeal, Scheffer argues that the District Court erred in its determination that the Amended Information was timely filed. In this regard, both he and the State dispute which time-computation rule governs calculations under \u00a7 46-11-205(1), MCA. We need not resolve this dispute, however, because we agree with the State that the amendment was one of form, not substance, and as such was permissible under \u00a7 46-11-205(3), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">\u00b638 An information is a written accusation of criminal conduct prepared by a prosecutor in the name of the State. <em>Wilson, </em>\u00b6 25. The information must reasonably apprise the accused of the charges against him, so that he may have the opportunity to prepare and present his defense. <em>Wilson, </em>\u00b6 25. \u201cThe court may permit an information to be amended as to form at any time before a verdict or finding is issued if no additional or different offense is charged and if the substantial rights of the defendant are not prejudiced.\u201d Section 46-11-205(3), MCA. An amendment is one of form when the same crime is charged, the elements of the crime and the proof required remain the same, and the defendant is informed of the charges against him. <em>Wilson, </em>\u00b6 26. To differentiate amendments of form and substance, we examine whether an amendment to an information or complaint alters the nature of the offense, the essential elements of the crime, the proofs, or the defenses. <em>Wilson, </em>\u00b6 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">\u00b639 In the present case, the nature of the offense was the same, the essential elements of the crime remained the same, and there is no indication that the proofs or the defenses changed in response to the amendment. The alleged facts underlying the tampering and attempted-tampering charges were identical: Scheffer first penetrated H.K.\u2019s vagina with his fingers; he later stuck his fingers in his mouth and wiped them on his jeans at the stationhouse, prior to their being swabbed for DNA. The only difference in the State\u2019s proof following the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>amendment was that the swabs revealed the presence of both Scheffer\u2019s DNA and H.K\u2019s DNA, instead of inconclusive results or no DNA at all, thus indicating that he did not <em>actually </em>\u201calter, destroy, conceal, or remove\u201d the evidence, <em>see </em>\u00a7 45-7-207(l)(a), MCA, but only <em>attempted </em>to do so. There were no new allegations of additional or different instances of criminal conduct. <em>Cf. City of Red Lodge v. Kennedy, </em>2002 MT 89, \u00b6\u00b6 15-16, 309 Mont. 330, 46 P.3d 602. The amended charge was identical to the original charge except that the phrase \u201caltered, destroyed, concealed, or removed\u201d in the original charge was replaced with the phrase \u201cattempted to alter, destroy, conceal, or remove\u201d in the amended charge. <em>Cf. State v. Matson, </em>227 Mont. 36, 43, 736 P.2d 971, 975 (1987) (insertion of the word \u201cserious\u201d before the phrase \u201cbodily injury\u201d to describe the charge of aggravated assault was an amendment of form); <em>State v. Clark, </em>1998 MT 221, \u00b6 52, 290 Mont. 479, 964 P.2d 766 (change from possession of methamphetamine to possession of amphetamine was an amendment of form).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">\u00b640 Furthermore, while Scheffer claims the amendment was \u201cgreatly injurious\u201d to his substantive rights and \u201cdrastically interfered\u201d with his ability to prepare a defense, he proffers nothing concrete in support of these bald assertions. He speculates that had he \u201cbeen afforded adequate opportunity to prepare a defense to the \u2018attempt\u2019 charge, defense counsel may have theorized during cross-examination and closing that Scheffer could not have attempted to tamper with physical evidence of a crime he did not commit.\u201d We fail to see, however, how he was precluded from making this argument. A plausible change in his defense is suggested in the attempt statute itself, which states that \u201c[a] person shall not be liable under this section if, under circumstances manifesting a voluntary and complete renunciation of his criminal purpose, he avoided the commission of the offense attempted by abandoning his criminal effort.\u201d Section 45-4-103(4), MCA. But again, there is no indication that Scheffer was precluded in any way from presenting such evidence and making this argument at trial. Finally, the State points out that Scheffer was not exposed to any greater punishment as a result of the amendment, given that tampering and attempted-tampering convictions lead to the same possible punishment. <em>See </em>\u00a7 45-4-103(3), MCA; <em>cf. State v. Gardipee, </em>2004 MT 250, \u00b6 9, 323 Mont. 59, 98 P.3d 305 (defendant\u2019s substantial rights were not prejudiced by amendment of the information on the morning of trial from misdemeanor partner or family member assault to felony partner or family member assault, since the amendment merely reflected the statutorily mandated sentencing range for a repeat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>offender).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\">\u00b641  Based on the foregoing, we conclude that the amendment of the tampering charge to an attempted-tampering charge was a timely amendment as to form and that Scheffer\u2019s substantial rights were not prejudiced by this amendment. Section 46-11-205(3), MCA. Accordingly, the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Scheffer\u2019s motion to dismiss the Amended Information.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">\u00b642 <em>Issue 3. Must Scheffer\u2019s conviction of attempted tampering with or fabricating physical evidence be vacated as \u201cirrationally inconsistent\u201d with his acquittal of sexual intercourse without consent?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">\u00b643 Scheffer claims his conviction of attempted tampering with or fabricating physical evidence must be set aside because it is \u201cirrationally inconsistent\u201d with his acquittal of sexual intercourse without consent. He contends that the verdict of not guilty on the rape charge means that the alleged rape never occurred, and from this he reasons that \u201cit was a practical impossibility for Scheffer to tamper with or attempt to tamper with any evidence of a non-existent rape\u201d and, thus, that the jury \u201ccould not have logically concluded that Scheffer attempted to tamper with evidence related to a rape that never occurred.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">\u00b644 As the State points out, however, this argument is inconsistent with the elements of the attempted-tampering offense. The State had to prove that Scheffer, believing that an official proceeding or investigation was pending or about to be instituted, attempted to alter, destroy, conceal, or remove any \u201cthing\u201d (specifically, DNA evidence) with purpose to impair its verity or availability in such proceeding or investigation. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 45-4-103, 45-7-207(l)(a), MCA (2005). The State was not required to prove that the official proceeding or investigation actually resulted in the conviction of a crime; rather, it had to prove that Scheffer believed that an official proceeding or investigation was pending or about to be instituted and that Scheffer\u2019s purpose was to impair the verity or availability of the evidence in such proceeding or investigation \u2014 evidence which, it should be noted, Detective McDermott had specifically requested for purposes of his investigation into H.K.\u2019s allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">\u00b645  Furthermore, even if an actual rape \u201cnever occurred,\u201d it does not necessarily follow that it was a \u201cpractical impossibility\u201d for Scheffer to attempt to tamper with evidence of the events and acts in question. To convict on the rape charge, the State had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Scheffer knowingly had sexual intercourse without consent with H.K., <em>see </em>\u00a7 45-5-503(1), MCA, which here means <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>that he penetrated her vulva with his finger or fingers (presumably for purposes of sexual arousal or gratification), <em>see </em>\u00a7 45-2-101(68), MCA, and that H.K. was compelled to submit by force or was incapable of consent, <em>see </em>\u00a7 45-5-501(1), MCA. Scheffer admitted at trial that he put his fingers into H.K\u2019s vagina. Thus, he now observes on appeal that \u201c[t]he rape acquittal inherently suggests that any contact between Scheffer and [H.K] was found to be consensual.\u201d In other words, while the evidence established that Scheffer penetrated H.K\u2019s vulva, the State failed to prove that this was without consent. Yet, the DNA evidence on his fingers did not go to the element of consent; rather, it went to prove penetration, which indisputably did occur. Thus, the fact that the jury apparently determined that the penetration was consensual does not negate the fact that the DNA evidence was evidence of the charged offense, nor does it negate the fact that Scheffer attempted to tamper with this evidence by sticking his fingers into his mouth.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">\u00b646  We conclude that Scheffer\u2019s conviction of attempting to alter, destroy, conceal, or remove physical evidence relating to a pending official proceeding or investigation into his alleged sexual intercourse without consent with H.K. is not \u201cirrationally inconsistent\u201d with his ultimate acquittal of that underlying charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">\u00b647 The District Court did not err in denying Scheffer\u2019s motion to suppress and did not abuse its discretion in denying Scheffer\u2019s motion to dismiss the Amended Information. His conviction of attempted tampering with or fabricating physical evidence need not be vacated as \u201cirrationally inconsistent\u201d with his acquittal of sexual intercourse without consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">\u00b648 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b564-8\">JUSTICES LEAPHART, COTTER, MORRIS and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b543-6\"> The audio recording of the 9-1-1 call was played to the jury at Scheffer\u2019s trial and is contained in the record on appeal. H.K. is audibly upset and crying during the call. Remarkably, H.K. was (without explanation) interrupted and put on hold five times-complete with elevator music and a prerecorded voice thanking her for calling and for her patience-before she was able to recount fully all of the details of the alleged rape attempt. About five minutes into the call, it was picked up by a second dispatcher, who put H.K. back on hold after she stated why she was calling.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b545-7\"> In the Statement of the Facts of the Appellant\u2019s Brief, Scheffer\u2019s counsel states that \u201c[wjhen McDermott exited the room to obtain swabbing supplies, a nervous and intoxicated Scheffer began chewing his finger nails as he often does when plagued by stress.\u201d Counsel next states that McDermott \u201cviewed Scheffer\u2019s nervous reaction much differently\u201d as \u201csticking his fingers in his mouth and attempting to purposely remove DNA.\u201d The fact is, however, that Scheffer can be seen first sticking his fingers entirely in his mouth, taking them out, wiping them on his jeans, and refolding his arms, and then, 20 seconds later, chewing briefly on his fingernails. The implication that Scheffer andMcDermott simplyinterpreted a single act differently is misleading andinaccurate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b550-5\"> <em>See Missouri v.
