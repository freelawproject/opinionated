The WCC granted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>Zurich\u2019s motion. Boyd appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">\u00b62 The dispositive issue on appeal is whether the WCC erred in granting Zurich\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">\u00b63 In November 2004, Terry Boyd began working as a pipefitter for TIC, a Wyoming industrial contractor. Boyd was injured in a work-related accident on January 18, 2005. TIC was insured for workers\u2019 compensation claims by Zurich. Boyd formally notified TIC of his injury on February 1, 2005, and sought initial medical attention on February 2, at which time he saw a family nurse practitioner in Fort Benton, Montana. An x-ray of his hand taken at that time revealed no breaks or dislocations.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">\u00b64 On February 9, Boyd saw Dr. Hill, a physician in Basin, Wyoming. Boyd complained to Hill of left hand, fingers, and forearm pain. On February 23, Boyd was evaluated by PA-C Kolar of the Occupational Health and Wellness Department at Deaconess Billings Clinic, again complaining of hand and forearm pain. Upon re-evaluation by Kolar on March 2, Boyd reported increasing pain radiating up his arm and into his shoulder. Boyd submitted a First Report of Injury and Occupational Disease to the Montana Department of Labor and Industry (DOLI) on March 7,2005. He did not reference shoulder pain in the report, stating that the affected parts of his body were his left hand and fingers.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-9\">\u00b65 Kolar requested an occupational medicine consultation with Dr. Ross, a physician at Deaconess Billings Clinic. Ross examined Boyd and announced that Boyd had reached \u201cmaximum medical improvement with zero percent (0%) whole person impairment with regard to his left hand injury.\u201d Boyd then requested referral to a specialist and retained an attorney. The parties agreed that Dr. Rosen at the Billings Clinic would see Boyd for further evaluation. In July 2005, Boyd reported to Rosen that he had injured his shoulder and left arm in the drill accident in January 2005. Among other things, Rosen\u2019s medical notes indicate that Boyd\u2019s \u201cwork-related injury on January 18th, 2005, resulted] in a left shoulder girdle and forearm extensor muscle strain.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b355-10\">\u00b66 In early 2006, Boyd was evaluated by Dr. Bryan, also at the Billings Clinic. Bryan asked Zurich to authorize and pay for a bone scan of Boyd\u2019s neck and shoulder. Zurich denied Bryan\u2019s request noting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>that Boyd\u2019s claim was for a thumb/hand injury and that it would not \u201caccept any neck/cervical diagnosis.\u201d However, because Boyd continued seeking medical treatment for his shoulder, in June 2006, Zurich sent Boyd back to Rosen for re-evaluation. Rosen concluded that Boyd\u2019s shoulder pain was related to a cervical discectomy Boyd underwent in 1997 rather than his work-related injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">\u00b67 In July 2006, Boyd saw Dr. Landon in Casper, Wyoming. He complained of pain in his shoulder and in both hands. Later that same month, Boyd saw Dr. Whipp in Lander, Wyoming. Dr. Whipp stated in his notes that based on Boyd\u2019s complaints and description of his work-related accident his shoulder and hand complaints were \u201cprobably related to it.\u201d Boyd sent Whipp\u2019s medical report to Zurich. On October 27,2006, Zurich acknowledged receipt of Whipp\u2019s records and notified Boyd that it was denying liability for his shoulder complaints as \u201cthose conditions are unrelated to the injury of January 18, 2005.\u201d In November 2006, Whipp once again saw Boyd and noted in his report that there \u201cprobably [was] a connection\u201d between Boyd\u2019s pain and his work-related accident. Again, Whipp\u2019s report was submitted to Zurich, and on December 28, 2006, the insurer once again denied liability for Boyd\u2019s shoulder injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">\u00b68 In June 2008, Boyd consulted Dr. Schneider who stated in his report that Boyd\u2019s shoulder pain was \u201cclearly and unequivocally due to his [2005] work-related injury.\u201d Schneider reiterated this conclusion in a February 2009 letter to Boyd.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">\u00b69 On August 14, 2008, Boyd filed a \u201cPetition for Workers\u2019 Compensation Mediation Conference\u201d with the DOLI. Mediation ensued, and a Mediator\u2019s report was issued on October 7, 2008. In March 2009, Zurich again denied liability for pain or injury to Boyd\u2019s shoulder. Subsequently, Boyd filed a Petition for Hearing on May 8, 2009. In June 2009, Zurich moved for summary judgment on the ground that Boyd had not filed his petition within two years of Zurich\u2019s initial denial of his claim as required by \u00a7 39-71-2905, MCA. Following a telephone conference with the parties on August 5, 2009, the WCC granted Zurich\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Boyd appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">\u00b610 This matter is governed by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act of 2003. All statutory references are to the 2003 statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b356-9\">\u00b611 We review the WCC\u2019s ruling on summary judgment de novo. <em>Dildine v. Liberty Northwest Ins. Corp., </em>2009 MT 87, \u00b6 9, 350 Mont. 1, 204 P.3d 729.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">\u00b612 Boyd challenges the WCC\u2019s conclusions that: 1) a \u201cdispute over liability\u201d vis-\u00e1-vis his shoulder injury arose in June 2006, 2) this \u201cdispute\u201d triggered the 2-year statute of limitations provided in \u00a7 39-71-2905(2), MCA, and 3) Boyd\u2019s Petition for Hearing was not timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">\u00b613 Boyd argues that his Petition for Hearing was timely filed under two statutes of limitations-\u00a7\u00a7 39-71-2905(2) and 27-2-203, MCA. While these statutes have different \u201ctriggering\u201d events, both allow a plaintiff to commence his or her action within 2 years of the specified triggering event. Section 39-71-2905, MCA, is triggered by a denial of workers\u2019 compensation benefits, and requires a claimant to seek a hearing for resolution of a dispute over benefits within 2 years after benefits are denied. Section 27-2-203, MCA, invokes the \u201cdiscovery rule\u201d and is triggered by \u201cdiscovery\u201d of a mistake giving rise to a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">\u00b6 14 Boyd asserts that when he began seeking medical attention for his shoulder pain and submitting his doctors\u2019 reports to Zurich, he did not then request benefits for his shoulder injury. He claims that without such a request for benefits, Zurich\u2019s \u201cdenial of benefits\u201d throughout 2006 did not create a \u201cdispute over liability,\u201d was irrelevant, and did not serve to trigger the statute of limitations in \u00a7 39-71-2905, MCA. He argues that Zurich did not actually deny his claim until after he submitted Schneider\u2019s medical opinion in June 2008; therefore, his May 2009 Petition for Hearing was timely filed under \u00a7 39-71-2905, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">\u00b615 Additionally, Boyd argues that the doctors he saw shortly after his accident misdiagnosed him and this misdiagnosis constituted a \u201cmistake.\u201d He maintains that as a result of this mistake, he is entitled to bring his action under the \u201cmistake\u201d statute of limitations, \u00a7 27-2-203, MCA. Given that he did not \u201cdiscover\u201d the misdiagnosis until June 2008 when Schneider stated that his shoulder injury was caused by the work accident, he argues that the filing of his petition in May 2009 was well within the 2-year statute of limitations set forth in \u00a7 27-2-203, MCA. As such, his petition was timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">\u00b616 Lastly, Boyd argues that he could not file a claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits for his shoulder injury until the injury was \u201cestablished by objective medical findings\u201d (\u00a7 39-71-407(2)(a), MCA), and \u201csubstantiated by clinical findings.\u201d Section 39-71-116(19), MCA. Boyd asserts that he could not make a claim for his shoulder injury until he received Schneider\u2019s report unequivocally linking his accident with his injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>\u00b617 Zurich argues that \u00a7 39-71-2905(2), MCA, is the applicable statute of limitation because it is the \u201cmore specific\u201d statute. Codified in the chapter addressing workers\u2019 compensation claims, \u00a7 39-71-2905, MCA, directly addresses claims brought before the WCC. Conversely, \u00a7 27-2-203, MCA, is a general statute addressing civil claims brought on the ground of fraud or mistake. Zurich concludes, however, that regardless of which statute is applied, Boyd\u2019s claim accrued in 2006 when Whipp opined the condition was linked to the accident and Zurich in turn unequivocally denied liability for any shoulder complaints. This being so, his filing in May 2009 was untimely under either statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">\u00b618 Zurich further submits that the discovery rule is not available to Boyd because evidence linking Boyd\u2019s shoulder condition to the accident was neither concealed nor self-concealing, and Boyd did not act diligently in pursuing his claim. Boyd first obtained \u201cevidence\u201d that his shoulder injury was related to the accident in 2006 when Whipp opined that the injury arose out of the accident. Therefore, even if Boyd could rely on the discovery rule in \u00a7 27-2-203, MCA, Boyd \u201cdiscovered\u201d the link in 2006, triggering the running of the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">\u00b619 Boyd put Zurich on early notice that he considered his shoulder injury part of his work-related accident claim by submitting the medical reports of various treating physicians to Zurich. Additionally, while \u201cfiling of forms ... by the attending physician does not constitute a claim for compensation\u201d (\u00a7 39-71-604(1), MCA), one doctor, Dr. Bryan, actually requested authority from and payment by Zurich to conduct further diagnostic tests on Boyd\u2019s shoulder. Zurich denied Bryan\u2019s request in February or March 2006, and disclaimed any liability for Boyd\u2019s shoulder injury. This constituted Zurich\u2019s first denial of coverage for Boyd\u2019s shoulder claim. However, on appeal, Zurich invokes a denial date of October 27,2006, when it wrote a letter to Boyd\u2019s attorney after receiving Whipp\u2019s first medical report, and explicitly denied coverage for Boyd\u2019s shoulder injury claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">\u00b620  The October 27, 2006 letter firmly established a denial of benefits and the existence of a \u201cdispute over liability,\u201d thus triggering the 2-year statute of limitations contained in \u00a7 39-71-2905(2), MCA, which provides that \u201c[a] petition for a hearing before the workers\u2019 compensation judge must be filed within 2 years after benefits are denied.\u201d Taking into account the tolling of the statute for mediation, the limitations period began to run on October 27,2006, was tolled for 79 days for mediation, and expired on January 14, 2009. Boyd did not file his Petition for Hearing until May 2009. The WCC did not err in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>concluding that Boyd\u2019s filing was untimely under the applicable statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">\u00b621  Next, we address Boyd\u2019s argument as to the applicability of \u00a7 27-2-203, MCA. As we have stated on numerous occasions, \u201c[wjhere one statute deals with a subject in general and comprehensive terms and another deals with a part of the same subject in a more minute and definite way, the special statute will prevail over the general statute to the extent of any necessary repugnancy between them.\u201d <em>Bryant v. Hall, </em>157 Mont. 28, 482 P.2d 147 (1971). In <em>Bryant, </em>we held that the specific statute of limitations governing wrongful death actions controlled over the general statute of limitations applicable to a variety of actions seeking damages for real and personal property rights. <em>Bryant, </em>157 Mont. at 33, 482 P.2d at 149-50. <em>See also State v. Brendal, </em>2009 MT 236, \u00b6 18, 351 Mont. 395, 213 P.3d 448 (When we can, we harmonize general and specific statutes to give effect to both; when we cannot, the specific statute controls.). In the case before us, \u00a7 39-71-2905, MCA, is a specific statute that establishes the limitations periods for disputes over benefits and requires that a petition for hearing be filed within 2 years of denial of benefits. The WCC did not err by applying \u00a7 39-71-2905, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">\u00b622 Finally, we are not persuaded by Boyd\u2019s argument that he could not file his claim without Schneider\u2019s unequivocal opinion on causation. As noted above, earlier medical opinions rendered in 2006 and submitted to Zurich drew a connection between the accident and the shoulder injury. <em>See </em>Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 7-8. In any event, we have held on repeated occasions that claimants are not required to prove causation through medical expertise or opinion. <em>See Plainbull v. Transamerica Ins. Co., </em>264 Mont. 120, 870 P.2d 76 (1994) and <em>Prillaman v. Community Med. Center, </em>264 Mont. 134, 870 P.2d 82 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">\u00b623 For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the WCC\u2019s order of summary judgment in favor of Zurich.</p>\n<judges id=\"b359-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES WHEAT, MORRIS and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
