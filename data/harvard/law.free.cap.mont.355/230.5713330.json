The State\u2019s affidavit supporting its request to file the information alleged that Weatherell had beaten his girlfriend\u2019s two-year-old son by striking him in the head and chest. According to the affidavit, Weatherell admitted that he had become \u201cfrustrated when M.G. would not stop playing and go to bed.\u201d The beating allegedly caused severe bruising on the child\u2019s head and chest. The next day Weatherell\u2019s girlfriend took the child to St. Joseph\u2019s Hospital in Poison, Montana. At first Weatherell\u2019s girlfriend allegedly hesitated to take the child to the hospital for fear that law enforcement would blame her for the injuries and, consequently, social services would take custody of her children. At the hospital, a Lake County sheriffs deputy observed the child. Later that day the deputy arrested Weatherell.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">\u00b64 At his arraignment, Weatherell originally pleaded not guilty to assault on a minor and criminal endangerment, but entered an <em>Alford </em>plea (a plea of guilty in which the defendant maintains his innocence, <em>see North Carolina v. Alford, </em>400 U.S. 25, 37-38, 91 S. Ct. 160, 167-68 (1970)) to PFMA. Subsequently, Weatherell moved to dismiss the remaining charges on the basis of double jeopardy. In his supporting brief, Weatherell cited \u00a7 46-ll-410(2)(a), (d), MCA, and the double jeopardy provisions of the Constitutions of Montana and the United States. The District Court denied Weatherell\u2019s motion, reasoning that the prosecution did not trigger double jeopardy because the charges required different elements of proof. Later, pursuant to a plea agreement, Weatherell pleaded guilty to assault on a minor, and the State dismissed the charge of criminal endangerment with prejudice. In the plea agreement, Weatherell reserved his right to appeal the District Court\u2019s denial of his motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-9\">\u00b65 The District Court then entered judgment, convicting Weatherell for assault on a minor and PFMA, and dismissing the criminal endangerment charge. The District Court sentenced Weatherell to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>Department of Corrections for five years for assault on a minor with all time suspended. The District Court also sentenced Weatherell to one year in the Lake County Jail with all save thirty days suspended for PFMA. Additionally, the District Court made the suspended sentences subject to twenty-five conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">\u00b66 Exercising the right he reserved, Weatherell now appeals the denial of his motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">\u00b67 We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to dismiss on the basis double jeopardy de novo, which is a nondeferential review of the district court\u2019s decision based on the record. <em>State v. Beavers, </em>1999 MT 260, \u00b6 21, 269 Mont. 340, 167 P.2d 371; Steven Alan Childress &amp; Martha S. Davis, <em>Federal Standards of Review </em>vol. 1, \u00a7 2.14, 2-79 (3d ed., Lexis 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">\u00b68 <em>Whether WeatherelVs conviction for assault on a minor was barred by double jeopardy.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b258-9\">\u00b69 The prohibition against double jeopardy \u201cwas designed to protect an individual from being subjected to the hazards of trial and possible conviction more than once for an alleged offense.\u201d <em>Green v. United States, 355 U.S. 184, 187, 78 S. </em>Ct. 221, 223 (1957).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-10\">The underlying idea, one that is deeply ingrained in at least the Anglo-American system of jurisprudence, is that the State with all its resources and power should not be allowed to make repeated attempts to convict an individual for an alleged offense, thereby subjecting him to embarrassment, expense and ordeal and compelling him to live in a continuing state of anxiety and insecurity, as well as enhancing the possibility that even though innocent he may be found guilty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b258-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 187-88, 78 S. Ct. at 223.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-12\">\u00b610 Weatherell asserts that his prosecution for assault on a minor offended the prohibition against double jeopardy. In support of this position, Weatherell presents both statutory and constitutional arguments. We address Weatherell\u2019s statutory argument first and then turn to his constitutional claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>\u00b611 Weatherell first contends that \u00a7 46-ll-410(2)(d), MCA,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the relevant double jeopardy statute, <em>State v. Sor-Lokken, </em>247 Mont. 343, 352, 805 P.2d 1367, 1373 (1991), prohibited the State from prosecuting him for assault on a minor under \u00a7 45-5-212, MCA, subsequent to his <em>Alford </em>plea to PFMA under \u00a7 45-5-206, MCA. We find this argument unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">\u00b612 Section 46-11-410(1) to (2), MCA, provides that when a person\u2019s conduct in one transaction constitutes multiple offenses, the State may prosecute the person for each offense, subject to five enumerated limitations. The limitations relevant to this case protect the person from being prosecuted for more than one offense if \u201cone offense is included in the other\u201d or \u201cthe offenses differ only in that one is defined to prohibit a specific instance of the conduct.\u201d Section 46-ll-410(2)(a), (d), MCA. Our case law evaluating double jeopardy defenses brought under these two provisions has employed a single standard in which we consider the elements of each charge to determine whether each charge requires proof of a fact that the other does not (if so, prosecution for each charge is not statutorily prohibited). <em>See State v. Matt, </em>2005 MT 9, \u00b6\u00b6 11-15, 325 Mont. 340, 106 P.3d 530; <em>McQuiston, </em>277 Mont. at 406-07, 922 P.2d at 525, <em>rev\u2019d in part on other grounds, Herman, </em>\u00b6 12 n. 1; <em>Sor-Lokken, </em>247 Mont. at 351-52, 805 P.2d at 1373; <em>State v. Hall, </em>224 Mont. 187, 190-92, 728 P.2d 1339, 1341-42 (1986), <em>rev\u2019d in part on other grounds, Montana v. Hall, </em>481 U.S. 400, 404-05, 107 S. Ct. 1825, 1827 (1987); <em>cf Colorado v. Miller, </em>604 P.2d 36, 37 (Colo. 1979) (stating that statutory provision similar to \u00a7 46-11-410(2)(d), MCA, \u201cis intended to deal with situations where the offenses themselves are <em>defined </em>in terms of general and specific conduct\u201d (quoting <em>Colorado v. Blair, </em>579 P.2d 1133, 1143 (Colo. 1978))). Essentially, this test determines whether one of the two charges is an \u201cincluded offense,\u201d which is statutorily defined as an offense that \u201cis established by proof of the same or less than all the facts required to establish the commission of the offense charged.\u201d Section 46-1-202(9)(a), MCA. The relationship of such charges could be illustrated by a Venn diagram of concentric, rather than merely overlapping, circles. <em>See </em>Wayne R. LaFave, et al., <em>Criminal Procedure </em>vol. 5, \u00a7 17(4)(b), 80 (3d ed., West 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">\u00b613  Applying this test, we consider here the elements of PFMA and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>assault on a minor. Under \u00a7 45-5-206(l)(a), MCA, a person commits PFMA if he (1) \u201cpurposely or knowingly,\u201d (2) \u201ccauses bodily injury,\u201d (3) \u201cto a partner or family member.\u201d \u201cPurposely of knowingly\u201d is the required mental state, or <em>mens </em>rea; \u201ccauses bodily injury,\u201d the required conduct, or <em>actus </em>reus; and \u201cto a partner or family member,\u201d the required attendant circumstance. <em>Id.; see </em>Wayne R. LaFave, <em>Substantive Criminal Law </em>vol. 1, \u00a7 1.2(c), 16 (2d ed., West 2003). Pursuant to \u00a7 45-5-212(1), MCA, a person commits assault on a minor if he \u201ccommits an offense under 45-5-201, and at the time of the offense, the victim is under 14 years of age and the offender is 18 years of age or older.\u201d Incorporating the relevant cross-reference, the elements of assault on a minor are (1) \u201cpurposely or knowingly,\u201d the <em>mens rea; </em>(2) \u201ccauses bodily injury,\u201d the <em>actus reus; </em>and (3) to another who \u201cis under 14 years of age and the offender is 18 years of age or older,\u201d the attendant circumstances. While their mental states and conduct are identical, the attendant circumstances of PFMA and assault on a minor differ, with neither being a subset of the other. Thus, the PFMA charge required proof that the victim was a family member but did not require proof that the victim was a minor. Likewise, the assault on a minor charge required proof that the victim was a minor but did not require proof that the victim was a family member. Consequently, despite some overlap, assault on a minor under \u00a7 45-5-212, MCA, is neither included in nor a specific instance of PFMA under \u00a7 45-5-206, MCA. Therefore, the District Court correctly held that under \u00a7 46-ll-410(2)(a), (d), MCA, Weatherell\u2019s <em>Alford </em>plea to PFMA did not foreclose the subsequent prosecution for assault on a minor.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">\u00b614 Weatherell contends that his prosecution for assault on a minor was barred by \u00a7 46-1 l-410(2)(d), MCA, because both PFMA and assault on a minor are specific instances of assault (\u00a7 45-5-201, MCA). This argument, however, conflicts with the text of \u00a7 46-ll-410(2)(d), MCA, penological principle, and prior case law. It conflicts with the text of the statute, because \u00a7 46-ll-410(2)(d), MCA, prohibits a person from being prosecuted for two offenses when \u201cthe offenses differ only in that one is defined to prohibit a specific instance of the conduct.\u201d It does not prohibit prosecution for two offenses that are both specific instances of conduct prohibited by a third, uncharged statute, as Weatherell advocates. Further, both PFMA and assault on a minor are aggravated forms of assault, each reflecting a distinct societal norm-the disapproval of violence against family members and the disapproval of violence against minors, respectively. See \u00a7\u00a7 45-5-201(2), -206(3), - 213(2), MCA (enhanced penalty for assault on minor and PFMA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>relative to ordinary assault). In such case, \u201cin which different legal norms enter into real competition for the punishment of the same act-only then does a cumulation of punishment seem logically justifiable.\u201d Otto Kirchheimer, <em>The Act, the Offense and Double Jeopardy, </em>58 Yale L.J. 513, 522 (1949). In fact, this Court has previously upheld a conviction for two types of aggravated assault that arose out of the same conduct but that were distinguished, as here, on the basis of the status of the victim. <em>See Matt, </em>\u00b6 15 (holding that assault with a weapon is not an offense included in assault on a peace officer). Consequently, we reject Weatherell\u2019s statutory argument.</p>\n<p id=\"ApM\">\u00b615 We turn next to Weatherell\u2019s constitutional argument, which is based on the double jeopardy clause of the Montana Constitution. This clause reads, \u201cNo person shall be again put in jeopardy for the same offense previously tried in any jurisdiction.\u201d Mont. Const, art. II, \u00a7 25. Weatherell contends that this provision, which is broader than the double jeopardy clause of United States Constitution, imports the provisions of \u00a7 46-11-504, MCA, into this case. Section 46-11-504, MCA, bars the State from prosecuting a person for conduct if the person has formerly been acquitted or convicted in another jurisdiction for the same transaction from which the subsequent Montana prosecution arises. Applying this statute, through the Montana Constitution, Weatherell contends that his prosecution for assault on a minor should be prohibited because it arose from the same transaction as the PFMA charge to which he initially entered his <em>Alford </em>plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\">\u00b616 This argument, however, was not raised before the District Court. Parties may not raise claims for the first time or change legal theories on appeal. <em>State v. Weaselboy, </em>1999 MT 274, \u00b6 16, 296 Mont. 503, 989 P.2d 836. While Weatherell raised constitutional claims below, he did not mention the argument that he presents here. Instead, he argued that the double jeopardy analysis was identical under \u00a7 46-11-410(2), MCA, and the Constitutions of Montana and the United States. Accordingly, we decline to address Weatherell\u2019s new argument here.</p>\n<p id=\"AJl\">\u00b617 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b261-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES NELSON, MORRIS and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b259-6\"> This section was previously codified at \u00a7 46-11-502, MCA. <em>State v.
