(Neighbors), appeal the order of the District Court of the Eleventh Judicial District, Flathead County, granting the motion to dismiss to Eyrie Shotgun Ranch, LLC (Ranch). We affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">\u00b62 We review the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b407-9\">\u00b63 <em>Did the District Court properly dismiss Neighbors\u2019public nuisance claim?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b407-10\">\u00b64 <em>Did the District Court properly dismiss Neighbors\u2019 private nuisance claims?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b407-11\">\u00b65 <em>Did the District Court properly dismiss Neighbors\u2019 trespass claim ? </em>\u00b66 <em>Did the District Court properly dismiss Neighbors\u2019 attractive nuisance claim?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b407-12\">\u00b67 <em>Did the District Court properly dismiss Neighbors\u2019 constitutional and statutory claims?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b407-13\">\u00b68 <em>Did the District Court properly dismiss Robert Hayes as a defendant?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b407-14\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b407-15\">\u00b69 Robert Hayes (Hayes) purchased approximately 60 acres of property in 2006 located in the Tally/Bissell Zoning District near homes and properties owned by Neighbors. The Tally/Bissell Zoning District lies southwest of Whitefish, Montana, in Flathead County. Hayes transferred the property to the Ranch, of which he is a member. Hayes and the Ranch constructed a private shooting range on the 60 acres.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>\u00b610 Neighbors filed a multi-count action in which they alleged that the Ranch\u2019s operation of a shooting range in close proximity to a subdivision and an elementary school constituted both a public nuisance and a private nuisance. Neighbors further claimed that the shooting range presented an attractive nuisance, that it constituted trespass, and that its operation violated various provisions of the Montana Constitution. Finally, Neighbors alleged pursuant to \u00a7 76-9-105, MCA, that the court had authority to close the Ranch because it presented a \u201cclear and provable safety hazard.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">\u00b611 The Ranch filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. The District Court dismissed Neighbors\u2019 public nuisance claim on the basis that \u00a7 76-9-101, MCA, specifically authorizes shooting ranges, and, thus, shooting ranges may not be considered a nuisance pursuant to \u00a7 27-30-101(2), MCA. The court determined that \u00a7 27-30-102, MCA, barred the private nuisance claim because the alleged condition-noise-could not constitute both a private and public nuisance.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">\u00b612 Neighbors had requested an injunction under the attractive nuisance claim to prevent the \u201clikelihood of injury\u201d to nearby schoolchildren. The District Court dismissed the claim on the basis that attractive nuisance represents a tort theory that requires a showing of damage. Mere anticipation of injury, according to the court, proved insufficient to enjoin the shooting range. The court dismissed the trespass action on the grounds that noise cannot constitute a trespass. The court reasoned that only a person or tangible thing that enters the property of another can constitute a trespass.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">\u00b613 The court summarily dismissed Neighbors\u2019 constitutional claims. The court dismissed Neighbors\u2019 claim under \u00a7 76-9-105, MCA, due to the vagueness in the statute in that it provides no procedures for closure or relocation of a shooting range. The court further ruled that the statute provides for no private cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">\u00b614 The court also dismissed Hayes as a defendant. The court determined that \u00a7 27-30-105, MCA, applied only to successive landowners. Hayes had owned the land before selling it to the Ranch and the court reasoned that no nuisance existed until the Ranch had constructed the shooting range. Neighbors appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b408-9\">\u00b615 We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s ruling on a motion to dismiss pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). <em>Meagher v. Butte-Silver Bow City County, </em>2007 MT 129, \u00b6 13, 337 Mont. 339, 160 P.3d 552. A motion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) admits the allegations in the well-pled complaint. The court must consider the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff in evaluating the motion. The court also must take as true all the allegations of fact contained in the complaint. <em>Meagher, </em>\u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-3\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\">\u00b616 <em>Did the District Court properly dismiss Neighbors\u2019public nuisance claim?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">\u00b617 Neighbors rely on <em>Martin v. Vincent, </em>181 Mont. 247, 593 P.2d 45 (1979), and <em>Wheeler v. Moe, </em>163 Mont. 154, 515 P.2d 679 (1973), in arguing that the District Court improperly dismissed their public nuisance claim by looking beyond the face of the complaint. The Court in <em>Martin </em>determined that a court may not rely on \u201cmatters outside the allegations of the complaint\u201d in granting a motion to dismiss. <em>Martin, </em>181 Mont. at 251, 593 P.2d at 48. The district court in <em>Martin </em>had relied upon factual matters outside the complaint. For example, the district court determined that the brokers had failed to disclose their dual capacity as both broker and buyer based upon the brokers\u2019 signatures on both the listing agreement and the sales contract. <em>Martin, </em>181 Mont. at 248, 593 P.2d at 46. This Court determined that nothing on the face of the complaint allowed the district court to conclude that the brokers had failed to disclose their dual capacity. <em>Martin, </em>181 Mont. at 250, 593 P.2d at 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">\u00b618 Nothing in <em>Martin, </em>however, barred the district court from considering the applicable law when reviewing a motion to dismiss. Nothing in the District Court\u2019s order indicates that it looked at factual matters outside the allegations contained in the complaint. The court expressly stated in its order, \u201ceven taking all of the allegations as true and the claim as well pled,\u201d \u00a7\u00a7 27-30-101(2) and 76-9-101, MCA, barred Neighbors\u2019 relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">\u00b619 The plaintiffs in <em>Wheeler </em>filed an action against the Missoula County Sheriff, the Missoula County Attorney, and other public officials. <em>Wheeler, </em>163 Mont. at 155, 515 P.2d at 680. This Court in <em>Wheeler </em>upheld a district court\u2019s dismissal of the plaintiffs complaint based upon the public officials\u2019 immunity from civil prosecution in the performance of their official duties. <em>Wheeler, </em>163 Mont. at 163, 515 P.2d at 684. The Court noted that the plaintiffs complaint contained no allegations that the public officers had been acting in any capacity other than as public officials. <em>Wheeler, </em>163 Mont. at 163, 515 P.2d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>684. This Court dismissed the complaint as insufficient to support a claim. <em>Wheeler, </em>163 Mont. at 161, 515 P.2d at 683.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">\u00b620 Neighbors go astray with their argument that nothing in their complaint expressly refers to \u00a7 76-9-101, MCA. The plaintiffs complaint in <em>Wheeler </em>did not expressly refer to the fact that public officials enjoyed immunity from civil prosecution in the performance of their official acts. The complaint in Wheeler referred solely to the fact that the defendants had been performing official acts. <em>Wheeler, </em>163 Mont. at 160, 515 P.2d at 682. Here, as in <em>Wheeler, </em>the District Court must apply the controlling law to the factual allegations raised in the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">\u00b621 Neighbors allege that the Ranch\u2019s shooting range constitutes a public nuisance. Sections 27-30-101(2) and 76-9-101, MCA, apply regardless of whether Neighbors refer to them explicitly in their complaint. To presume that a district court can grant a motion to dismiss only if the plaintiff expressly raised all potential affirmative defenses or controlling statutes would undermine the district court\u2019s responsibility in reviewing a motion to dismiss. The district court considered no facts beyond the face of Neighbors\u2019 complaint. The court merely applied law directly applicable to Neighbors\u2019 complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">\u00b622 We now must review whether the District Court properly applied \u00a7\u00a7 27-30-101(2) and 76-9-101, MCA. Section 27-30-101(2), MCA, provides that \u201cnothing which is done or maintained under the express authority of a statute can be deemed a nuisance.\u201d Section 76-9-101, MCA, provides protection for \u201cthe locations of and investment in shooting ranges for shotgun, archery, rifle, and pistol shooting.\u201d Neighbors argue that \u00a7 76-9-101, MCA, represents a general policy statement that does not expressly authorize all shooting ranges.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">\u00b623 This Court addressed the effect of \u00a7 27-30-101(2), MCA, in <em>Barnes v. City of Thompson Falls, </em>1999 MT 77, 294 Mont. 76, 979 P.2d 1275. We determined in <em>Barnes </em>that a court must inquire whether the activity is authorized \u201ceither by the express terms of the authorizing statute or by necessary implication therefrom\u201d as a threshold matter under \u00a7 27-30-101(2), MCA. <em>Barnes, </em>\u00b6 27. The test of statutory authorization thus requires a \u201cparticularized assessment of each authorizing statute in relation to the act which constitutes the nuisance.\u201d <em>Barnes, </em>\u00b6 21. Only in this manner can a court ensure an \u201cunequivocal\u201d legislative intent to sanction a nuisance while avoiding the uncertainty that would result were every generally worded statute allowed to immunize nuisance liability. <em>Barnes, </em>\u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>\u00b624 Nothingin \u00a7 76-9-101, MCA, expressly immunizes shooting ranges from civil nuisance liability. A review of the legislative history of \u00a7 76-9-101, MCA, proves instructive in interpreting the generally worded policy statement contained in the statute. The Montana Legislature adopted House Bill 487, \u201cAn Act Protecting Shooting Range Locations,\u201d with the purpose to protect pre-existing shooting ranges from community encroachment and from neighbors complaining of noise or safety hazards from the ranges. Mont. H. Local Gov. Comm., <em>An Act Protecting Shooting Range Locations: Hearing on HB 487, </em>52nd Leg., Reg. Sess. 8-9 (Feb. 19, 1991), Mont. Sen. Fish &amp; Game Comm. <em>An Act Protecting Shooting Range Locations: Hearing on HB 487, </em>52nd Leg., Reg. Sess. 6-7 (Mar.14, 1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-3\">\u00b625 House Bill 487 added an entirely new Chapter to Title 76 to protect shooting ranges. House Bill 487 also included four amendments to other code provisions. The Legislature expressly exempted shooting ranges from \u00a7\u00a7 7-5-2109, 7-5-2110, 45-8-101, and 45-8-111, MCA. These exemptions protect shooting ranges from the definition of community decay, litter, disorderly conduct, and the criminal provision for public nuisances. Mont. HB 487, 52nd Leg., Reg. Sess. (Mar. 14, 1991). The Legislature combed through the Montana Code to exempt shooting ranges from four specific areas, including criminal public nuisance under Title 45 of the criminal code.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\">\u00b626 The Legislature chose not to exempt shooting ranges from the specific civil provisions regarding civil public nuisance in Title 27, Chapter 30. The Dissent posits that we should infer statutory authorization of new shooting ranges by \u201cnecessary implication\u201d because \u00a7\u00a7 76-9-101, 103, and 104, MCA, authorize the act in question-operation of the shooting ranges. Dissent, \u00b6\u00b6 59, 60. The Dissent argues further that the statutory authorization test from <em>Barnes </em>asks only whether the questioned activity falls \u201cwholly outside its statutory authority.\u201d Dissent, \u00b6 63.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">\u00b627 The test enunciated in <em>Barnes </em>ultimately considers whether the defendant\u2019s activity falls outside its statutory authority. <em>Barnes, </em>\u00b6 25. Before considering whether the defendant\u2019s activity falls outside its statutory authority, however, a court must undertake a \u201cparticularized assessment\u201d of the authorizing statute to determine whether the questioned activity even warrants protection in the first place. <em>Barnes, </em>\u00b6 25. By requiring such a \u201cparticularized assessment,\u201d the reviewing court ensures an \u201cunequivocal legislative intent\u201d expressly to or necessarily to imply authorization. <em>Barnes, </em>\u00b6 21. The parties in <em>Barnes </em>did not dispute that the statute authorized the alleged nuisance \u2014 the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>city\u2019s sewage and storm drain system. <em>Barnes, </em>\u00b6 27. The Neighbors sharply dispute, however, whether \u00a7 76-9-101, MCA, authorizes shooting ranges. Thus, this Court must undertake a particularized assessment of the statute to determine the Legislature\u2019s intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">\u00b628 The statute certainly evinces the requisite unequivocal legislative intent to protect shooting ranges from adverse local planning and zoning efforts under \u00a7\u00a7 76-9-103, 104, MCA. We cannot discern a similar unequivocal intent, however, to exempt shooting ranges from civil nuisance liability. <em>Barnes, </em>\u00b6 21. In fact, we must assume the opposite. The Legislature protected shooting ranges explicitly from planning, zoning, community decay, litter, disorderly conduct, and criminal nuisance, but made no mention of civil nuisance liability.</p>\n<p id=\"ART\">\u00b629  This Court may not insert what has been omitted, or omit what has been inserted. Section 1-2-101, MCA. We cannot insert an inference in \u00a7 76-9-101, MCA, by the Legislature to shield shooting ranges from civil nuisance liability. The Legislature carefully crafted House Bill 487 and elected to exempt shooting ranges from specific provisions of the Montana Code. We decline to interpret these specific provisions of the statute to encompass an omitted provision. We reverse and remand to the District Court to allow Neighbors to further develop their civil public nuisance claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">\u00b630 <em>Did the District Court properly dismiss Neighbors\u2019 private nuisance claims?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">\u00b631 Montana law defines a public nuisance as one that affects an \u201centire community or neighborhood or any considerable number of persons.\u201d Section 27-30-102, MCA. A private nuisance, by contrast, includes every nuisance not included in the definition of public nuisance. Section 27-30-102, MCA. The District Court reasoned that the noise from the shooting range could not constitute both a public and private nuisance \u201cby application of the legal definition of Section 27-30-102, MCA.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">\u00b632 Montana adopted \u00a7 27-30-102, MCA, verbatim from California Civil Code \u00a7 3480. This Court follows the construction placed on the statute by the highest court of the state that first enacted the statute. <em>Barnes, </em>\u00b6 19. The California Court of Appeals has recognized that a nuisance may qualify as both a public and private nuisance. <em>Koll-Irvine Ctr. Prop. Owners Assn. v. Co. of Orange, </em>24 Cal. App. 4th 1036, 1041 (1994). The <em>Koll-Irvine </em>court determined that the plaintiff must show an injury specific to the use and enjoyment of his or her land in order to proceed on a private nuisance theory. The injury \u201cneed not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>different in kind,\u201d however, from that suffered by the general public. <em>Koll-Irvine, </em>24 Cal. App. 4th at 1041.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-3\">\u00b633 The District Court determined that the noise from the Ranch\u2019s shooting range represents a condition common to all the plaintiffs. As noted in <em>Koll-Irvine, </em>however, a district court should focus on the in/wry \u2014 whether the alleged nuisance interferes with a specific plaintiffs use and enjoyment of his land. <em>Koll-Irvine, </em>24 Cal. App. 4th at 1041. The court should not focus on whether the <em>condition </em>constituting the alleged nuisance is unique to a particular plaintiff. <em>Koll-Irvine, </em>24 Cal. App. 4th at 1041.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\">\u00b634  Some degree of increased noise from the Ranch\u2019s shooting range may present a condition common to Neighbors\u2019 public and private nuisance claims. The injuries alleged in Neighbors\u2019 private nuisance claims, however, are unique to each member of the group. For example, Neighbors\u2019 private nuisance claims allege interference with the Triple D Game Farm, which supplies animals for still and cinema photography, and obstruction of Rob Rice\u2019s home recording studio. These injuries, including potential pecuniary losses associated with them, are unique and specific to particular residents in the Tally/Bissell Zoning District. The District Court improperly focused on the condition common to all plaintiffs in the form of increased noise from the shooting range. The court should have focused on the injuries alleged by specific plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">\u00b635 <em>Did the District Court properly dismiss Neighbors\u2019 trespass claim ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"AJ5\">\u00b636 The District Court reasoned that the definition of trespass requires a person or <em>thing </em>to enter the property of another. The court determined that sound did not constitute a tangible thing. Neighbors contend that the modern view supports an action for trespass based upon intangible intrusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">\u00b637 Neighbors point to cases from a variety of jurisdictions that recognize intangible invasions such as noise, light, airborne gases, and electromagnetic fields to support actions for trespass. <em>See Cook v. Rockwell Int\u2019l Corp., </em>273 F. Supp. 2d 1175, 1200 (D. Col. 2003) (plutonium plume contaminants), <em>Mock v. Potlatch Corp., </em>786 F. Supp. 1545, 1551 (D. Idaho 1992) (noise from plant\u2019s electrical generator), <em>Elton v. Anheuser-Busch Beverage Group, Inc., </em>50 Cal. App. 4th 1301, 1307 (1996) (fire and smoke). All these jurisdictions have required a showing of actual physical damage, however, in bringing a trespass action based upon noise or some other intangible invasion.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">\u00b638 The recognition of a trespass claim based upon an intangible invasion, yet requiring a showing of actual damage, maintains the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>distinction between trespass and nuisance. The law predicates the tort of trespass upon a party\u2019s right to exclusive possession of his property. <em>Cook, </em>273 F. Supp. 2d at 1199; see also the Restatement (Second) of Torts, \u00a7 163, cmt. d (1965). A nuisance action, by contrast, serves to protect a party\u2019s right to free use and enjoyment of his property. Section 27-30-101, MCA. The entry of another person or thing obstructs a property owner\u2019s exclusive possession. A party need not establish actual harm or damages in a traditional trespass action. <em>Cook, </em>273 F. Supp. 2d at 1199-1200.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">\u00b639  With respect to an intangible trespass, however, the majority of courts have reasoned that the party\u2019s right to exclusive possession has not been infringed. <em>Cook, </em>273 F. Supp. 2d at 1200. As a result, courts generally require a showing of actual damage to support a cause of action for trespass based upon an intangible item. <em>Cook, </em>273 F. Supp. 2d at 1200. We agree with the analysis employed by these courts and recognize an intangible invasion, accompanied by actual damages, to support a cause of action for trespass. The District Court failed to recognize that Neighbors may be able to establish actual damages in support of their intangible trespass claim. The District Court denied Neighbors the opportunity to develop facts and evidence sufficient to establish actual damage when it prematurely dismissed their trespass claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">\u00b640 <em>Did the District Court properly dismiss Neighbors\u2019 attractive nuisance claim?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">\u00b641 Neighbors argue that the anticipation of injury proves sufficient to sustain an attractive nuisance claim. Neighbors cite Montana cases where this Court has contemplated injunctions brought under nuisance theory grounded in tort. <em>See Purcell v. Davis, </em>100 Mont. 480, 488, 50 P.2d 255, 256 (1935); <em>Boyer v. Karagacin, </em>178 Mont. 26, 32, 582 P.2d 1173, 1177 (1978); <em>Dutton v. Rocky Mtn. Phosphates, </em>151 Mont. 54, 74, 438 P.2d 674, 685 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">\u00b642 Under the Ranch\u2019s argument, attractive nuisance represents a tort theory that requires a showing of causation and damages. The Ranch contends that Neighbors failed to allege causation and damages in their complaint. The Ranch seeks to distinguish nuisance from attractive nuisance on the basis that Montana law has codified nuisance in a statute that expressly provides for injunctive relief as a remedy. Sections 27-30-202, 301, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">\u00b643 Injunctive relief represents a principle of equity. <em>Wells v. Young, </em>2002 MT 102, \u00b6 12, 309 Mont. 419, 47 P.3d 809 (2002) (overruled in part on other grounds). This Court has long recognized that flexible, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>not cast-iron, rules govern courts of equity. <em>State ex rel. Farm Credit Bank of Spokane v. Dist. Ct. of Third Jud. Dist. Co. of Powell, </em>267 Mont. 1, 24, 881 P.2d 594, 607 (1994). These rules call upon the courts of equity to adapt themselves to the exigencies of the particular case. <em>State ex rel. Farm Credit Bank of Spokane, </em>267 Mont. at 24, 881 P.2d at 607.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-3\">\u00b644 Even though the Legislature now has codified nuisance law in Montana, nuisance theory sounds in general tort principles just like attractive nuisance. As a result, a court sitting in equity may grant injunctive relief for anticipated or potential danger under a tort claim such as attractive nuisance, as long as the plaintiff meets the requirements of an attractive nuisance claim. These requirements include: 1) an artificial condition maintained by the possessor of land in a place which the possessor knows or should know that children are likely to trespass; 2) the condition involves an unreasonable risk of death or serious bodily harm; 3) children because of their youth will be unable to discover the condition or realize the danger; 4) the utility of maintaining the condition is slight compared to the risk it presents to young children; and 5) the possessor fails to exercise reasonable care to eliminate the danger or otherwise protect the children. <em>Big Man v. State of Montana, </em>192 Mont. 29, 38, 626 P.2d 235, 240 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\">\u00b645 This approach comports with the statutory standard for granting injunctions. A preliminary injunction under \u00a7 27-19-201, MCA, requires a showing \u201cthat the commission or continuance of some act during the litigation <em>would </em>produce a great or irreparable injury to the applicant.\u201d Section 27-19-201(2), MCA (emphasis added). A court may grant a permanent injunction where \u201cpecuniary compensation would not afford adequate relief.\u201d Section 27-19-102(1), MCA. The flexible nature of equitable principles allows Neighbors to attempt to establish a prima facie case for a preliminary injunction by showing \u201cthat it is at least doubtful whether or not [they] will suffer irreparable injury.\u201d <em>Benefis Healthcare v. Great Falls Clinic, LLP, </em>2006 MT 254, \u00b6 14, 334 Mont. 86, 146 P.3d 714.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">\u00b646  The Neighbors properly alleged in their complaint all the elements of attractive nuisance from <em>Big Man. </em>The court denied Neighbors the opportunity, however, to develop facts of an actual threat of irreparable injury. The District Court acted too hastily in dismissing the Neighbors\u2019 attractive nuisance claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">\u00b647 <em>Did the District Court properly dismiss Neighbors\u2019 constitutional and statutory claims?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b416-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>\u00b648 This Court refused in <em>Shammel v. Canyon Resources Corp., </em>2007 MT 206, 338 Mont. 541, 167 P.3d 886, to determine whether Article II, Section 3, and Article IX, Section 1, right to a clean and healthful environment, support a cause of action for money damages between two private parties \u201cwhere adequate alternative remedies exist under common law or statute.\u201d <em>Shammel, </em>\u00b6 8. Neighbors also have failed to demonstrate how common law or statutory remedies would not adequately address any potential damages. <em>Sunburst School Distr. No. 2 v. Texaco, Inc., </em>2007 MT 183, \u00b6 64, 338 Mont. 259, 165 P.3d 1079. We agree with the District Court\u2019s decision to dismiss Neighbors\u2019 claim for monetary damages based upon Article II, Section 3, and Article IX, Section 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">\u00b649 Neighbors next claim that operation of the shooting range near an elementary school would violate Article X, Section 1(1) and (3) of the Montana Constitution. These provisions guarantee all Montanans \u201cequality of educational opportunity,\u201d and that \u201cthe Legislature shall provide a basic system of free quality public elementary and secondary schools.\u201d Mont. Const. Art. X, Sec. 1. Article X, Section 1 of the Montana Constitution requires the Legislature to fund a quality educational system. <em>Columbia Falls Elementary School Dist. No. 6 v. State, </em>2005 MT 69, \u00b6 31, 326 Mont. 304, 109 P.3d 257. Nothing in these provisions directly address the conduct of private parties. The District Court correctly dismissed Neighbors\u2019 claim based upon Article X, Section 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">\u00b650 A similar analysis applies to Neighbors\u2019 statutory claim. Section 76-9-105, MCA, provides that established shooting ranges \u201cmay not be prevented from operation by a state agency, unit of local government, or court unless the range presents a clear and provable safety hazard to the adjacent population.\u201d We already have determined that Neighbors may proceed with the common law nuisance and trespass claims contained in their complaint. A decision by a court to enjoin or abate a nuisance or trespass would encompass any \u201cclear and provable safety hazard to the adjacent population\u201d posed by the shooting range. As a result, we need not determine whether \u00a7 76-9-105, MCA, provides for a private right of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">\u00b651 <em>Did the District Court properly dismiss Robert Hayes as a </em>defendant?</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">\u00b652 Neighbors\u2019 complaint alleges that Hayes initiated construction of the shooting range before selling the property to the Ranch. The complaint alleges that the noise from the operation of the shooting range forms the basis of the various claims. The complaint further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>alleges that this noise began simultaneously with construction of the shooting range. Thus, the complaint alleges that the nuisance-noise from shotgun blasts-began at the same time as initial construction of the shooting range. Hayes still owned the property at the start of the construction process. Neighbors allege that Hayes created the nuisance before he transferred the property to the Ranch.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-3\">\u00b653 Taking the allegations of the well-pled complaint as true, Neighbors properly included Hayes as a defendant. Neighbors cannot now enjoin Hayes from operating a shooting range that he no longer owns. Neighbors can seek, however, to prove that they suffered damages as a result of Hayes\u2019 actions in creating the alleged disturbance from the shotgun blasts while he owned the property. <em>Meagher, </em>\u00b6 13; \u00a7\u00a7 27-30-103, 104, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\">\u00b654  Section 27-30-105, MCA, provides that every \u201csuccessive owner of property\u201d who neglects to abate a continuing nuisance upon or in the use of such property, created by a former owner, is liable in the same manner as the one who created the nuisance. The Ranch stands as a successive landowner under \u00a7 27-30-105, MCA. Neighbors properly seek to enjoin the Ranch and recover damages from the Ranch based on the Ranch\u2019s continued operation of the shooting range.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">\u00b655 The District Court correctly dismissed Neighbors\u2019 constitutionally based claims and their attempts to assert a private right of action pursuant to\u00a7 76-9-105,MCA. The District Court improperly dismissed Neighbors\u2019 public, private, and attractive nuisance claims and trespass claim at the pleadings stage. The District Court also improperly dismissed Robert Hayes as a defendant. We reverse and remand to the District Court to allow Neighbors the opportunity to develop further these claims.</p>\n<judges id=\"b417-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES NELSON and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b417-8\">JUSTICE RICE,</author>\n<p id=\"AAa\">concurring and dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-9\">\u00b656 I would affirm the District Court\u2019s dismissal of the nuisance claims. I concur with the Court\u2019s resolution of all other issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-10\">\u00b657 The Court correctly follows <em>Barnes\u2019 </em>instruction to make a \u201cthreshold\u201d determination of whether the act alleged to be a nuisance is authorized \u201ceither by the express terms of the authorizing statute or by necessary implication therefrom.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 23. However, I disagree with the threshold determination the Court has made.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>\u00b658 The Court offers from the legislative history of \u00a7 76-9-101, MCA, that the statute was adopted \u201cwith the purpose to protect pre-existing shooting ranges from community encroachment\u201d and notes that \u201c[t]he Legislature chose not to exempt shooting ranges from the specific civil provisions regarding civil public nuisance.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 24, 26. From this, the Court concludes that there is no \u201cunequivocal intent ... to exempt shooting ranges from civil nuisance liability.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 28. \u00b659 First, I disagree with the Court\u2019s assumption that the statute was meant to protect only pre-existing ranges. While parts of the statute are indeed directed toward protection of \u201cestablished shooting range[s],\u201d \u00a7 76-9-105(1), MCA, the statute also contains provisions barring the use of state and local laws or policies to \u201cprohibit the establishment of <em>new </em>shooting ranges,\u201d \u00a7\u00a7 76-9-103(2), -104(2), MCA (emphasis added). Thus, the statute has the purpose of protecting the future development of shooting ranges as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">\u00b660 To determine whether a statute \u201cauthorizes]\u201d the offending act, either by \u201cexpress\u201d authorization or by \u201cnecessary implication,\u201d <em>Barnes </em>explains that the issue is whether it \u201ccan be fairly stated that the legislature contemplated the doing of the very act which occasions the injury.\u201d <em>Barnes, </em>\u00b6 20 (quoting <em>Hassell v. San Francisco, </em>78 P.2d 1021, 1022-23 (Cal. 1938)). We labeled this the <em>\u201cHassell </em>test of statutory authorization.\u201d <em>Barnes, </em>\u00b6 21. Under this test, I believe it can be \u201cfairly stated\u201d that the Legislature intended \u201cthe doing of the very act\u201d which is alleged to cause the injury here, that being the operation of a shooting range. Section 76-9-101, MCA, states that \u201c[i]t is the policy of the state of Montana\u201d to promote \u201cthe safety and enjoyment of the shooting sports\u201d and, more specifically, to protect \u201cthe locations of and investment in shooting ranges for shotgun, archery, rifle, and pistol shooting.\u201d Thus, I would conclude that the statute authorizes the act in question here by \u201cnecessary implication.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">\u00b661 We further explained in <em>Barnes </em>that, while \u201ca statutorily authorized activity or facility cannot constitute an <em>absolute </em>nuisance as a matter of law,... nonetheless, [it] may become <em>aqualified </em>nuisance in fact \u201cby reason of the improper or negligent manner in which it is conducted.\u2019 \u201d <em>Barnes, </em>\u00b6 23 (emphasis added, citation omitted). Thus, even though the act in question cannot be challenged by way of an absolute nuisance claim, it can be challenged as a qualified nuisance claim based upon improper or negligent operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">\u00b662 However, Neighbors admit they have pursued only absolute nuisance claims, for both their public and private claims, acknowledging in their briefing that \u201c[flor the record, the Neighbors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>have not made a qualified nuisance claim.\u201d The parties\u2019 arguments about the private nuisance claim are largely about whether the private claims have been separately pled from the public nuisance claim. However, the statutory authorization analysis set forth above applies equally to either a public or private nuisance claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-3\">\u00b663 The Court states that the statute here does not evince an \u201cunequivocal [legislative] intent... to exempt shooting ranges from civil nuisance liability.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 28. However, the test is not whether the authorizing statute unequivocally exempts the activity from nuisance liability. Indeed, the statute at issue in <em>Barnes </em>simply authorized the city to establish a storm or sanitary sewerage system, and said nothing whatsoever about nuisance liability, nor contained anything like the devices which protect shooting ranges within the statute at issue here. Nonetheless, we held the actions of the City were not \u201cwholly outside of its statutory authority.\u201d <em>Barnes, </em>\u00b6 28. \u201cSince Thompson Falls\u2019 storm drain system was constructed and is maintained under the express authority of \u00a7 7-13-4301(l)(a), MCA, Barnes could only prevail on her nuisance claim by proving that Thompson Falls was negligent ....\u201d <em>Barnes, </em>\u00b6 28. The same result should be reached here. The test asks only whether the questioned activity is \u201cwholly outside of its statutory authority.\u201d <em>Barnes, </em>\u00b6 25. If it is not, then a claim for absolute liability cannot be brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">\u00b664 Consequently, I believe both the public and private nuisance claims fail, and I would affirm the District Court\u2019s dismissal of those claims.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
