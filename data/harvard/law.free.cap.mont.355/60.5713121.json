We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-17\">\u00b62 The sole issue on appeal is whether the District Court erred in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>upholding BER\u2019s decision denying the Conservation Groups\u2019 motion to amend their administrative pleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">\u00b63 Thompson River Power LLC (TRP) owns a coal- and wood waste-fired power plant (\u201cThompson River facility\u201d or \u201cfacility\u201d) in Thompson Falls, Montana, and pursuant to the Clean Air Act of Montana seeks an air quality permit in order to begin operations. An air quality permit will allow TRP to emit air contaminants from the facility into the atmosphere, but will require TRP to take certain steps to control air pollution. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 75-2-103(3), (9), -211(2) to (3), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">\u00b64 DEQ initially issued an air quality permit to TRP\u2019s predecessor, Thompson River Co-Gen (TRC),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in 2001 to construct and operate the Thompson River facility. TRP constructed the facility, installing a used stoker boiler purchased from R. J. Reynolds Corporation, and began to operate it intermittently from December 2004 to September 2005, primarily for testing purposes. DEQ modified TRP\u2019s permit in 2004 and again in 2005. TRP applied for further modification to its permit in early 2006, and DEQ issued a draft permit. In May 2006 DEQ denied issuance of the desired modification because TRP was not capable of complying with emissions limitations in either its existing permit or the proposed modified permit. TRP subsequently submitted another application for modifications to its air quality permit, and DEQ issued a modified permit to TRP on August 21, 2006. The question before the Court involves the issuance of this last modified permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">\u00b65 On September 3, 2006, the Conservation Groups challenged the modified air quality permit by requesting a contested case hearing with BER within fifteen days of DEQ\u2019s decision to issue the permit. On September 19, 2006, the Conservation Groups filed the affidavit required by \u00a7 75-2-211(10), MCA, stating their grounds for contesting the permit. In the affidavit, the Conservation Groups alleged various errors in DEQ\u2019s issuance of the air quality permit, including allegations that DEQ did not require TRP to comply with the best available control technology (BACT) requirements of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7475(a)(4) and that DEQ issued the permit without having complete information from TRP about, among other things, the heat input of the facility\u2019s second-hand boiler. BER appointed a hearing examiner to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>conduct prehearing activities, preside over the hearing, and issue proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-3\">\u00b66 In response to the Conservation Group\u2019s challenge, DEQ sent written discovery to the Conservation Groups on November 22, 2006. Later in November, DEQ filed motions to dismiss a number of the Conservation Groups\u2019 claims for failure to state a claim and for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The hearing examiner eventually denied DEQ\u2019s motions to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\">\u00b67 Three months after filing their affidavit, on December 19, 2006, the Conservation Groups sought leave from the hearing examiner to amend their affidavit to add a claim that potential emissions from the Thompson Falls facility would qualify it as a \u201cmajor stationary source.\u201d Classification of the facility as a major stationary source would subject it to additional air pollution controls under prevention of significant deterioration (PSD) regulations. The Conservation Groups argued that leave to amend was proper under Rule 15, M. R. Civ. P., because their motion was not based on an improper motive, but arose from the \u201csame nucleus of facts that gave rise to the original Affidavit\u201d-DEQ\u2019s issuance of the air quality permit to TRP.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">\u00b68 TRP and DEQ opposed the Conservation Groups\u2019 motion, arguing that the thirty-day limit in \u00a7 75-2-211(10), MCA, for filing an affidavit in support of a challenge to the issuance of an air quality permit had passed and therefore foreclosed the possibility of subsequent amendments. TRP and DEQ further argued that the Conservation Groups had not provided good cause for their proposed amendments and that the amendments would unnecessarily and inevitably prolong the proceeding, resulting in prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">\u00b69 The hearing examiner, declining to adopt the reasoning of either party, denied the Conservation Groups leave to amend their affidavit on the basis of Rule 15(c), M. R. Civ. P. The hearing examiner reasoned that the Conservation Groups\u2019 prior comments in the environmental review and permitting process, their petition for a contested hearing, and their original affidavit did not give notice to DEQ or TRP that the plant should be permitted as a major stationary source. The hearing examiner concluded, somewhat puzzlingly, that the Conservation Groups\u2019 proposed amendments did not assert a new claim, but that, nevertheless, the amendments did not relate back because they were based on different facts than those stated in the original affidavit. \u00b610 Subsequently, the hearing examiner held a contested case hearing at which the parties presented evidence and argument. The hearing examiner then issued findings of fact, conclusions of law, and a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>proposed order resolving the matter. The Conservation Groups filed objections to the findings of fact, conclusions of law, and proposed order, including an objection to the hearing examiner\u2019s denial of their motion to amend their original affidavit. TRP and DEQ opposed the Conservation Groups\u2019 exceptions. BER adopted the hearing examiner\u2019s ruling in its final order without addressing, and therefore impliedly upholding, the denial of the Conservation Groups\u2019 motion to amend. Pursuant to the Montana Administrative Procedures Act (MAPA), \u00a7 2-4-702, MCA, the Conservation Groups sought judicial review of BER\u2019s decision denying them leave to amend their affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">\u00b611 In the District Court, the Conservation Groups contended that BER\u2019s decision was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, and otherwise unlawful. DEQ and TRP intervened. The Conservation Groups moved for summary judgment, which DEQ and TRP opposed. The District Court denied summary judgment and affirmed the decision of BER. In reaching its decision, the District Court reviewed the reasoning of the hearing examiner and concluded that the hearing examiner\u2019s decision was not arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">\u00b612 The Conservation Groups timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">\u00b613  We review a district court\u2019s ruling on summary judgment de novo. <em>Signal Perfection, Ltd. v. Rocky Mt. Bank - Billings, </em>2009 MT 365, \u00b6 9, 353 Mont. 237, 224 P.3d 604. When the district court\u2019s decision is based on review of an agency action, MAPA governs our review. <em>See Bitterroot River Protective Assn. v. Bitterroot Conserv. Dist., </em>2008 MT 377, \u00b6 18, 346 Mont. 507, 198 P.3d 219. Under MAPA, we will reverse an agency decision if it is based on an incorrect conclusion of law that prejudices the substantial rights of an appellant. <em>Section </em>2-4-702(2)(a)(iv), MCA; <em>Hearing Aid Inst. v. Rasmussen, </em>258 Mont. 367, 371-72, 852 P.3d 628 (1993); <em>see also Bitterroot River Protective Assn., </em>\u00b6 18 (\u201c[N]o discretion is involved when a tribunal arrives at a conclusion of law-the tribunal either correctly or incorrectly applies the law.\u201d (quoting <em>Steer, Inc. v. Dept. of Revenue, </em>245 Mont. 470, 474, 803 P.2d 601, 603 (1990))). The application of Rule 15(c), M. R. Civ. P., to undisputed facts is a purely legal question subject to de novo review. <em>Garrett v. Fleming, </em>362 F.3d 692, 695 (10th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>Cir. 2004).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\">\u00b614 Justice Cotter, in dissent, objects to our chosen standard of review, raising a number of important points to which we hasten to respond. First, Justice Cotter observes that all parties to the appeal agreed that the standard of review should be abuse of discretion. However, while this is true, ultimately the appropriate standard of review is and should be determined by the Court, rather than by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">\u00b615 Second, Justice Cotter asserts that the Court mistakenly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>addresses the propriety of relation back under Rule 15(c), M. R. Civ. P., before addressing the propriety of amendment under Rule 15(a), M. R. Civ. P. Under the facts of this case, however, it would be illogical to address the propriety of amendment under Rule 15(a), M. R. Civ. P., before considering relation back under Rule 15(c), M. R. Civ. P. To explain why this is so, we must evaluate the steps of the hearing examiner\u2019s argument that were not articulated, but were implicitly necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">\u00b616 Under Rule 15(a), M. R. Civ. P., a court may deny leave to amend if the proposed amended claims would, on their merits, be futile. <em>Hobble-Diamond Cattle Co. v. Triangle Irrigation </em>Co., 249 Mont. 322, 326, 815 P.2d 1153, 1155-56 (1991). Here, the hearing examiner\u2019s implicit reasoning was that the Conservation Groups\u2019 amended claims would have been time barred by the thirty-day deadline for filing an affidavit under \u00a7 75-2-211(10), MCA-and thus futile under Rule 15(a), M. R. Civ. P. \u2014 unless the claims related back under Rule 15(c), M. R. Civ. P. The hearing examiner concluded that the claims did not relate back under Rule 15(c), M. R. Civ. P., and consequently they were time barred. Therefore, the proposed amended claims would be futile, so the hearing examiner denied leave to amend, necessarily under Rule 15(a), M. R. Civ. P. Because, in this case, the question of whether to grant leave to amend (Rule 15(a), M. R. Civ. P.) turned on resolution of whether the Conservation Groups\u2019 proposed claims would relate back (Rule 15(c), M. R. Civ. P.), Rule 15(c), M. R. Civ. P., was the threshold inquiry. <em>See </em>Slayton, 460 F.3d at 226 n. 11 (noting that denial of leave to amend may be based on the prior determination that an amendment would not relate back); <em>accord Bowles v. Reade, </em>198 F.3d 752, 757-59 (9th Cir. <em>1999); F.D.I.C. v. Conner, </em>20 F.3d 1376, 1385 (5th Cir. 1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">\u00b617 For these reasons, we respectfully disagree with Justice Cotter that analysis of the propriety of granting leave to amend under Rule 15(a), M. R. Civ. P., must always precede the relation back analysis under Rule 15(c), M. R. Civ. P.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">\u00b618 <em>Whether the District Court erred in upholding BER\u2019s decision denying the Conservation Groups\u2019 motion to amend their administrative pleading.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">\u00b619 Section 75-2-211(10), MCA, allows a party adversely affected by DEQ\u2019s issuance of an air quality permit to seek a contested case hearing by filing a request for a hearing within fifteen days of DEQ\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>decision to issue the permit and then, within thirty days of DEQ\u2019s decision, filing an affidavit setting forth the grounds for seeking a hearing. Here, the Conservation Groups timely filed their hearing request and affidavit, but then, approximately three months after the expiration of the period for filing the affidavit, they sought leave to amend their affidavit to assert additional challenges to the air quality permit. The hearing examiner denied the Conservation Groups\u2019 motion to amend on the basis of Rule 15(c), M. R. Civ. P., reasoning that the new claims that the Conservation Groups sought to add were based on different facts than their original claims and thus did not relate back to the filing of the initial affidavit. The Conservation Groups appeal this ruling, contending that their motion was consistent with Rule 15(c), M. R. Civ. P., because their new claims arose, like their initial claims, out of the decision of DEQ to grant a modified air quality permit to TRP.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\">\u00b620 The procedures of MAPA govern a contested case hearing under \u00a7 75-2-211(10), MCA. MAP\u00c1, however, does not expressly address motions to amend pleadings. Here, the hearing examiner evaluated the Conservation Groups\u2019 motion for leave to amend under Rule 15(c), M. R. Civ. P. The Montana Rules of Civil Procedure do not apply to administrative hearings, M. R. Civ. P. 1 (\u201cThese rules govern the procedure in the district courts of the state of Montana ....\u201d); although an agency may adopt them pursuant to statutory authority, <em>see e.g. Pannoni v. Bd. of Trustees, </em>2004 MT 130, \u00b6 69, 321 Mont. 311, 90 P.3d 438 (finding that Montana Rules of Civil Procedure did not apply to administrative proceeding because agency did not choose to adopt them), and the legislature may mandate their application by statute, <em>see e.g. </em>\u00a7 49-2-204(1), MCA (mandating the Montana Commission for Human Rights to adopt \u201call applicable portions of the Montana Rules of Civil Procedure\u201d); <em>Kloepfer v. Lumbermens Mut. Cas. Co., </em>272 Mont. 78, 81, 899 P.2d 1081, 1083 (1995) (\u201cThe statutes governing workers\u2019 compensation cases do not require that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court comply with the rules of civil procedure applicable to district court proceedings.\u201d). Nevertheless, where, as here, the Montana Rules of Civil Procedure do not govern an administrative proceeding, they may still serve as guidance for the agency and the parties. <em>Moen v. Peter Kiewit &amp; Sons Co., </em>201 Mont. 425, 434, 655 P.2d 482 (noting that while the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court is not governed by the Montana Rules of Civil Procedure, it \u201cmay be guided by them\u201d and that reference to them is acceptable); <em>see also Yaffe Iron &amp; Metal Co. v. U.S. Envtl. Protec. Agency, </em>774 F.2d 1008, 1012-14 (10th Cir. 1985) (finding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>no error where administrative law judge, relying in part on Rule 15(b), Fed. R. Civ. P., allowed agency to amend administrative pleading after hearing). Accordingly, it was permissible here for the hearing examiner to consider Rule 15(c), M. R. Civ. P., in evaluating the Conservation Groups\u2019 motion to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">\u00b621 Rule 15(c), M. R. Civ. P., reads in relevant part, \u201cWhenever the claim or defense asserted in the amended pleading arose out of the conduct, transaction, or occurrence set forth or attempted to be set forth in the original pleading, the amendment relates back to the date of the original pleading.\u201d When the conditions of Rule 15(c), M. R. Civ. P., are met, the amendment is not barred by the statute of limitations, see <em>e.g. Sooy, </em>218 Mont. at 423, 708 P.2d at 1017 (citing <em>Barrington v. A.H. Robins Co., </em>702 P.2d 563, 565 (Cal. 1961)), or similar time limitations on filing claims, <em>see e.g., Simmons, </em>246 Mont. at 207-09, 806 P.2d at 7-8. The basis of this rule is that once litigation concerning a particular transaction or occurrence has begun, the parties are no longer entitled to the protection of the statute of limitations from additional claims or defenses, added by amendment, that arise from the same transaction or occurrence. <em>Prentice Lumber Co., </em>161 Mont. at 15, 504 P.2d at 281. This rule is rooted \u201cin the equitable notion that dispositive decisions should be based on the merits rather than technicalities.\u201d <em>Woods v. Ind. U. -Purdue U. at Indianapolis, </em>996 F.2d 880, 884 (7th Cir. 1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">\u00b622 Once a suit is filed, \u201cthe defendant knows that the whole transaction described in it will be fully sifted, by amendment if need be, and that the form of the action or the relief prayed or the law relied on will not be confined to their first statement.\u201d <em>Barthel v. Stamm, </em>145 F.2d 487, 491 (5th Cir. 1944) (cited in Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller &amp; Mary Kay Kane, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure </em>vol. 6A, \u00a7 1497, 93 (2d ed., West 1990)). In determining whether the claim in the amended pleading arises from the same conduct, transaction, or occurrence as the original pleading, we focus on \u201cwhether the amended and original pleading are based on the same set of operative facts.\u201d <em>Smith, </em>266 Mont. at 10, 878 P.2d at 875. \u201c[A]n amendment which changes only the legal theory of the action ... will relate back.\u201d <em>Simmons, </em>246 Mont. at 208, 806 P.2d at 8 (quoting <em>Rozan, </em>150 Mont. at 125, 431 P.2d at 872). Ultimately, the policy of Rule 15(c), M. R. Civ. P., is generous toward allowing amendments. <em>First. Sec. Bank of Glendive v. Gary, </em>221 Mont. 329, 334, 718 P.2d 1345, 1348 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">\u00b623  Here, the claims that the Conservation Groups sought to add <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>arose from the same transaction or occurrence as the claims raised in their original affidavit; that is, the decision of DEQ to issue a modified air quality permit to TRP. It is this occurrence, the final agency action in issuing the permit, that triggers administrative and later judicial review.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Section 75-2-211(10), MCA (providing that a person may seek a contested hearing \u201cwhen the department approves ... the application for a permit\u201d); Admin. R. M. 17.8.1210(2)(j) (\u201cThe department\u2019s final decision regarding issuance ... of a permit is not effective until 30 days have elapsed from the date of the decision. The decision may be appealed to the board by filing a request for hearing within 30 days after the date of decision.\u201d). Indeed, the first sentence of the Conservation Groups\u2019 original affidavit announces: \u201cThis matter arises from the proposed issuance by the Montana Department of Environmental Quality ... of Air Quality Permit #3175-04 ... to Thompson River Co Gen [sic] Facility ... to construct and operate a power plant near Thompson Falls, Montana.\u201d The claims that the Conservation Groups sought to raise through amendment also challenged DEQ\u2019s issuance of the modified air quality permit. New theories based on the same transaction or occurrence relate back. <em>Simmons, </em>246 Mont. at 208, 806 P.2d at 8. From the Conservation Groups\u2019 original affidavit, DEQ knew that its decision to issue the air quality permit would be fully sifted and that the groups\u2019 theories for challenging the permit would not be confined to those presented in the original affidavit. <em>Barthel, </em>145 F.2d at 491. Thus, Rule 15(c), M. R. Civ. P., did not prevent the Conservation Groups from amending their original affidavit. BER\u2019s contrary ruling and the District Court\u2019s decision upholding that ruling were error. Further, because this error barred the Conservation Groups from raising potentially meritorious claims, it prejudiced their substantial rights, which is grounds for reversal under MAPA. Section 2-4-704(2)(a)(iv), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-4\">\u00b624 The hearing examiner, in denying the Conservation Groups leave to amend the affidavit, reasoned that neither DEQ nor TRP would have been on notice, based on the Conservation Groups\u2019 original affidavit, that the Thompson River facility should be permitted as a major stationary source, and thus subject to PSD regulations. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>Specifically, the hearing examiner wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-4\">In the analysis of whether the proposed amendments make more specific what has already been alleged, there are no allegations in the Notice of Appeal and Request for Hearing, the original Affidavit or the comments that address factors which would cause the Department or the Permittee to consider that the permittee should be permitted as a major stationary source. It is a leap to say that the Department or the permittee should have been on notice from the comments that at the TRC plant the actual heat input to the boiler would result in the potential to emit at levels greater than 250 tons per year of NOx and S02.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">This reasoning is mistaken for a number of reasons. First, the hearing examiner did not expressly consider whether the proposed amended claims arose from the same transaction or occurrence as the original claim, and to the degree that the hearing examiner implied that each discrete fact alleged in the original affidavit was a separate transaction and occurrence, the hearing examiner\u2019s view was impermissibly narrow. Second, the hearing examiner was mistaken because the Conservation Groups\u2019 original affidavit expressly revealed their contention, fully presented in their proposed amended affidavit, that the Thompson River facility should be subject to PSD regulations. In the original affidavit, the Conservation Groups. asserted that the issuance of the modified air quality permit was invalid because DEQ did not require TRP to comply with the best available control technology (BACT) requirements of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7475(a)(4). Section 7475(a)(4), which is part of the PSD provisions of the Federal Clean Air Act (FCAA), requires BACT for \u201cmajor emitting facilities.\u201d The definition of a \u201cmajor emitting facility\u201d in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7479(1), which is also part of the PSD program of the FCAA, is effectively identical to the definition of a \u201cmajor stationary source\u201d in Rule 17.8.801(22), Admin. R. M., which is part of Montana\u2019s PSD regulations. Thus, from the Conservation Groups\u2019 original affidavit, DEQ and TRP were on notice of a challenge to the permit as a \u201cmajor stationary source\u201d under PSD regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">\u00b625 Finally, DEQ argues that \u00a7 75-2-211(10), MCA, not Rule 15(c), M. R. Civ. P., governs the Conservation Groups\u2019 motion to amend. Section 75-2-211(10), MCA, provides that a party who is adversely affected by DEQ\u2019s decision to approve an air quality permit and who seeks a contested hearing must file an \u201caffidavit setting forth the grounds for the request... within 30 days after the department renders its decision.\u201d DEQ contends that the thirty-day limit for filing an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>affidavit acts as an absolute bar against any subsequent amendment of the affidavit of an adversely affected party. DEQ\u2019s proposed reading of \u00a7 75-2-211(10), MCA, conflicts with our reasoning in <em>Simmons v. Mountain Bell, </em>246 Mont. 205, 207-09, 806 P.2d 6, 7-8 (1990). In <em>Simmons, </em>the plaintiff filed a claim with the Human Rights Commission (HRC) alleging employment discrimination against her employer. <em>Id. </em>at 206, 806 P.2d at 6. The employer subsequently fired the plaintiff, and the plaintiff later amended her complaint to include a claim for retaliatory employment termination. <em>Id. </em>at 206, 806 P.2d at 6-7. The plaintiff, however, failed to amend her complaint within the 180-day period for filing a complaint under \u00a7 49-2-501, MCA. <em>Simmons, </em>246 Mont. at 207, 806 P.2d at 7. Consequently, the HRC dismissed the amended claim, reasoning that it was barred by the requirement that the complaint must be filed within 180 days. <em>Id. </em>at 207, 806 P.2d at 7. The issue on appeal was whether the amended claims, raised after the period for filing claims had expired, related back to the date of the original complaint under Rule 15(c), M. R. Civ. P. <em>Simmons, </em>246 Mont. at 207, 806 P.2d at 7. This Court held that the amended claim related back under Rule 15(c), M. R. Civ. P., because it arose out of the same transaction and occurrence as the original claim. <em>Simmons, </em>246 Mont. at 208-09, 806 P.2d at 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\">\u00b626  The instant case is analogous to <em>Simmons. </em>Section 75-2-211(10), MCA, like \u00a7 49-2-501(4)(a), MCA, provides a time limitation for filing an administrative pleading. Here, the Conservation Groups, like the plaintiff in <em>Simmons, </em>filed their pleading (affidavit) within the applicable time period, but then sought to amend the affidavit after the time period had expired. Here, as in <em>Simmons, </em>the claims the Conservation Groups asserted via amendment arose from the same transaction or occurrence as the claims in the original affidavit that was timely filed. Consequently, here, as in <em>Simmons, </em>the Conservation Groups\u2019 amended claims relate back to the time when they filed their original affidavit. Accordingly, we reject DEQ\u2019s argument that \u00a7 75-2-211(10), MCA, bars the Conservation Groups from amending their original affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">\u00b627 Justice Rice, in dissent, also contends that the thirty-day deadline in \u00a7 75-2-211(10), MCA, forecloses the possibility of any subsequent amendment and, therefore, that consideration ofRule 15, M. R. Civ. P., to allow amendments outside the thirty-day period is improper as a matter of law. In support of this position, Justice Rice notes our language from <em>In re Estate of Spencer, </em>2002 MT 304, \u00b6 13, 313 Mont. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>40, 59 P.3d 1160, where we stated, \u201cRule 81(c) [M. R. Civ. P.] does not inject the [Montana] Rules of Civil Procedure into other statutory schemes which provide different procedural requirements ....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">\u00b628 This reasoning, which would disallow any amendments after the initial thirty-day period for filing the initiating affidavit, goes too far. First, \u00a7 75-2-211(10), MCA, provides that hearings are to be governed by the contested case provisions of MAPA. While MAPA itself does not expressly address motions to amend, courts and commentators alike agree that amendments to administrative pleadings are proper and that leave to amend should be no more onerous in administrative cases than in civil cases. <em>See Yaffe Iron &amp; Metal Co., </em>774 F.2d at 1012-13 (\u201cIt is well settled that administrative pleadings are \u2018liberally construed\u2019 and \u2018easily amended.\u2019 In fact, as one commentator has noted, \u2018The most important characteristic of pleadings in the administrative process is their unimportance. And experience shows that unimportance of pleadings is a virtue.\u2019\u201d (quoting K. <em>Davis, Administrative Law Treatise </em>vol. 1, \u00a7 8.04, 523 (1958))); Ernest Gellhorn &amp; Ronald M. Levin, <em>Administrative Law and Process </em>250 (1997) (\u201cIf anything, technical defects in pleadings are less significant in administrative practice than in civil litigation.\u201d); Lee Modjeska, <em>Administrative Law Practice and Procedure </em>\u00a7 4.11, 121 (1982) (\u201cAdministrative pleadings are liberally construed and easily amended.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">\u00b629 Second, we do not believe that the requirement of \u00a7 75-2-211(10), MCA, that \u201c[a]n affidavit setting forth the grounds for the request [of a contested case hearing] ... be filed within 30 days,\u201d is a procedural requirement that is necessarily inconsistent with subsequent amendment. <em>See In re Est. of Spencer, </em>\u00b6 13. For example, under the Montana Rules of Civil Procedure, a defendant has a deadline for filing a responsive pleading within twenty days of service of the summons and complaint. M. R. Civ. P. 12(a). This deadline for filing a pleading, however, does not preclude subsequent amendments to the initial pleading. M. R. Civ. P. 15(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">\u00b630  Third, as a practical matter, in a contested case hearing, formal discovery will only occur after an adversely affected person files a request for a hearing and the affidavit setting forth the grounds for the requested hearing. This is particularly the case with regard to discovery of information from non-state actors, such as TRP here. In fact, in this case, DEQ filed its first discovery request two months after the Conservation Groups filed their affidavit. It would make little sense and would not foster resolution of contested cases on the merits to foreclose the possibility of amendments before significant discovery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>occurs, as Justice Rice\u2019s proposed interpretation of \u00a7 75-2-211(10), MCA, would do.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-3\">\u00b631 While we agree with Justice Rice that parties should not be allowed to abuse procedural rules in order to obstruct the administrative process, we feel that the standard grounds for denying motions to amend (undue delay, bad faith, undue prejudice, repeated failure to cure deficiencies by previously allowed amendments, futility, etc.) are adequate to prevent abuse. <em>E.g. Bitterroot Intl. Sys. Ltd. v. W. Star Trucks, Inc., </em>2007 MT 48, \u00b6 50, 336 Mont. 145, 153 P.3d 627 (cataloguing reasons for denying leave to amend).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-4\">\u00b632 All parties devote argument to whether the Conservation Groups\u2019 proposed amendments would unduly delay completion of the hearing, causing prejudice to DEQ and TRP. The hearing examiner expressly declined to address this issue in the order denying the Conservation Groups\u2019 motion to amend. Nor did BER or the District Court address the issue of potential prejudice from any delay occasioned by the proposed amendment. In the absence of any ruling on this issue below, we decline to address this matter here. The parties may address the issue of delay on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">\u00b633 We reverse the decision of the District Court. We remand this matter to the District Court, and ultimately to BER, for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b99-6\">JUSTICES MORRIS and NELSON and DISTRICT JUDGE BROWN, sitting for CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b88-8\"> For the sake of simplicity, we will refer to the owner and operator of the Thompson River facility as \u201cTRP\u201d throughout.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b91-6\"> Most of our opinions addressing Rule 15(c), M.

R. Civ. P. 227 Mont. at 378, 740 P.2d at 653. Further, the Court\u2019s analyses of the application of Rule 15(c), M. R. Civ. P., in both <em>Federated Mutual </em>and <em>Smith, </em>independently evaluated the facts of the cases without reference to the reasoning of the district courts, suggesting the practice of de novo review, rather than deferential abuse \u25a0of discretion review. <em>Fed. </em>Mut., \u00b6\u00b6 79-80; <em>Smith, </em>266 Mont. at 10-11, 878 P.2d at 875-76.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">We conclude that the better standard of review of a district court\u2019s determination of whether amended claims arise out of the same transaction or occurrence as the claims in an original pleading is de novo review. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals has articulated the rationale for such review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-8\">[A] relation back decision under Rule 15(c)(2) does not involve an exercise of discretion. A court reviewing a Rule 15(c)(2) decision performs a function analogous to that performed by an appellate court reviewing a dismissal for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6). In reviewing a 12(b)(6) dismissal, we ask whether the facts provable under the allegations of the complaint would support a valid claim for relief; in reviewing a Rule 15(c)(2) relation back decision, we ask whether the facts provable under the amended complaint arose out of conduct alleged in the original complaint. If so, the amended complaint will relate back. Because appellate courts seem to be \u201cin as good a position as the district court\u201d to make tins decision, the standard of review under Rule 15(c)(2) should arguably be de novo ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b91-9\"><em>Slayton v.

In this connection, I dissent from the Court\u2019s sua sponte decision to modify the standard of review applicable to orders entered pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 15(c). I would continue to adhere to our precedent that orders granting or denying leave to amend pleadings should be reviewed for an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-9\">\u00b635 The Conservation Groups presented their appeal in these words: \u201cThe sole issue on this appeal is whether the BER abused its discretion by denying leave to amend on the grounds that the Conservation Groups\u2019 proposed \u2018major source\u2019 claim did not arise out of the same \u2018conduct, transaction, or occurrence\u2019 as the original Affidavit.\u201d The Conservation Groups stated that a decision to deny leave to amend pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 15(c) is reviewed for abuse of discretion, citing <em>Priest v. Taylor, </em>227 Mont. 370, 740 P.2d 653 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-10\">\u00b636 In its response brief, DEQ cited our recent decision in <em>Farmers </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number><em>Coop. Assn. v. Amsden, LLC, </em>2007 MT 286, \u00b6 12, 339 Mont. 445, 171 P.3d 690, for the proposition that, under Rule 15, we review a decision denying leave to amend under the abuse of discretion standard. In its brief, Intervenor TRP similarly argued that the grant or denial of a motion to amend pleadings under Rule 15 is within the discretion of the reviewing court, and is reversible only for an abuse of discretion. Thus, all three parties to this case agree that our review of the hearing examiner\u2019s decision to deny the motion for leave to amend the affidavit should be for an abuse of discretion. Notwithstanding this rare uniformity of agreement among all parties, the Court has seen fit to sua sponte select a different and new standard of review with respect to motions to amend pleadings, which decision in turn drives the decision to reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">\u00b637 At \u00b6 13, footnote 2 of the Opinion, the Court engages in a somewhat lengthy analysis of what should be the standard of review under Rule 15(c), noting that few of our opinions discuss the appropriate standard of review with respect to this subpart of the Rule. This is where the Court goes off the tracks. The Court errs in conducting the Rule 15(c) analysis without first addressing, under Rule 15(a), the propriety of the hearing examiner\u2019s decision to deny the amendment in the first instance. This approach ignores the threshold inquiry which invokes the hearing examiner\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">\u00b638 Rule 15(a) addresses the circumstances under which a party may amend its pleadings. Once a requisite amount of time has passed, the rule provides that a party\u2019s pleading may be amended only by \u201cleave of court or by written consent of the adverse party,\u201d and that \u201cleave shall be freely given when justice so requires.\u201d The remaining subsections of the rule address \u201camendments to conform to the evidence,\u201d \u201crelation back of amendments,\u201d and \u201csupplemental pleadings.\u201d Of particular interest here is Rule 15(c), which provides generally that whenever a claim or defense asserted in an amended pleading arises out of the \u201cconduct, transaction, or occurrence set forth or attempted to be set forth in the original pleading, the amendment relates back to the date of the original pleading.\u201d This subsection of the rule requires a relation-back inquiry under those circumstances in which the amended pleading would otherwise be too late in time; it does not, however, displace the general rule set forth in Rule 15(a) that leave of court must be obtained for amendment of a pleading in the first instance. It is the \u201cleave of court\u201d which calls for an exercise of the district court\u2019s discretion, or in this case the discretion of the hearing examiner. If the court grants leave to amend, then, in cases calling for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>the determination, the <em>next </em>inquiry is whether the amendment already allowed relates back to the date of the original pleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-3\">\u00b639 I now turn to the precedent which the Court\u2019s decision seemingly overrules. In <em>Lindey\u2019s v. Professional </em>Consultants, <em>Inc., </em>244 Mont. 238, 797 P.2d 920 (1990), cited by TRP, the plaintiff sought leave to amend its complaint after the scheduling order deadline had expired. The district court denied the motion, and on appeal, we affirmed. Citing multiple cases, we said that the decision to grant or deny a motion to amend lies within the discretion of the trial court. <em>Lindey\u2019s, </em>244 Mont. at 242, 797 P.2d at 923. We further said that while the rule favors amendments, a trial court would be justified in denying a motion for such reasons as undue delay, bad faith, or a dilatory motive on the part of the movant, to name a few. We further said that a party seeking to overturn a district court\u2019s decision denying leave to amend must demonstrate an abuse of discretion. <em>Lindey\u2019s, </em>244 Mont. at 242, 797 P.2d at 923.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\">\u00b640 Later in the same year, we decided the case of <em>Simmons v. Mountain Bell, </em>246 Mont. 205, 806 P.2d 6 (1990). In that case, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint with the Montana Human Rights Commission (HRC) after the expiration of the statute of limitations, asserting an additional claim. The HRC denied leave to amend. On appeal, the district court held that Rule 15(c) applied, and that the filing of the amended complaint related back to the time of the filing of the action. On appeal, we affirmed. We agreed with the district court\u2019s conclusion that the HRC had \u201cabused its discretion\u201d when it concluded that barring the amendment did not disadvantage the plaintiff. <em>Simmons, </em>246 Mont. at 208, 806 P.2d at 7-8.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">\u00b641 Most recently, we-addressed a plaintiffs appeal from a district court\u2019s decision denying leave to amend its complaint to add an additional claim. In <em>Farmers, </em>we again announced the general rule that the decision to grant or deny a motion to amend lies within the discretion of the district court, and that we review such decisions to determine whether the court abused its discretion. <em>Farmers, </em>\u00b6 12..In addition, we again cited the multiple justifications a court might have for denying such a motion. We then addressed the specific claims presented by the plaintiff in its original complaint, the prejudice to the opposing party who operated for a year under the presumption that the original allegations were discrete, and the failure of the plaintiff to provide a sufficient reason for the late amendment. We concluded that several concerns expressed by the district court supported its decision to deny leave to amend the complaint. <em>Farmers, </em>\u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>\u00b642 Here, in similar fashion, the hearing examiner evaluated the status of the case as of the time that leave to amend was sought. The examiner concluded that the proposed amendment would change the way the application would be processed, that DEQ did not have prior notice of the proposed revision, and further that the Conservation Groups did not aver that the amended affidavit was based upon newly acquired information that was not available at the time of the initial filing. In other words, the hearing examiner cited the multiple reasons the amendment should, in her discretion, be denied. Upon its review, the District Court concluded that it was evident from the hearing examiner\u2019s order that issues such as delay and prejudice were also considered by her in arriving at her decision. The District Court concluded that the decision by the hearing examiner was not arbitrary or capricious, and that there was no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">\u00b643 Thus, contrary to the Court\u2019s assertion that futility was the basis for the hearing examiner\u2019s \u201cimplicit reasoning,\u201d I would find, as did the District Court, that the hearing examiner properly took account of several factors in rejecting leave to amend. Our well-reasoned precedent is clear: A court or hearing examiner is privileged to take account of multiple aspects of the case in deciding whether to exercise discretion in favor of or against an amendment. We err here, in my judgment, in jumping past this inquiry to an analysis of whether the facts provable under the amended complaint arose out of the conduct alleged in the original complaint, and in announcing a new standard of review applicable to this analysis. We should first look to whether the denial of the motion for leave to amend was an abuse of the hearing examiner\u2019s or the court\u2019s discretion, given the many factors taken into account by them in the first instance. It is this analysis which the hearing examiner conducted and which the District Court upheld. It is this analysis which invokes the hearing examiner\u2019s discretion, exercised based upon her knowledge of the status of the case and the possible problems attendant to a proposed amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"AI0\">\u00b644 In sum, I dissent from our revision of the standard of review of Rule 15 decisions, and consequently from the Court\u2019s determination to reverse the decision of the District Court. Had the hearing examiner and the District Court determined the amendment should have been allowed, I would have affirmed this exercise of discretion; similarly, I would conclude that denial of the amendment was likewise within the discretion of the hearing examiner under the facts presented here.</p>\n<p id=\"Au2\">\u00b645 I therefore dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b102-5\">JUSTICE RICE,</author>\n<p id=\"A1z\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>\u00b646 I agree with Justice Cotter\u2019s thoughts with regard to the correct standard of review of abuse of discretion. I write separately because, in my view, the request for leave to amend in this case was improper as a matter of law and, thus, <em>granting </em>the request would have constituted an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\">\u00b647 The governing statute provides that \u201c[a]n affidavit setting forth the grounds for the request must be filed within 30 days ....\u201d Section 75-2-211(10), MCA (2005). The \u201cgrounds\u201d set forth in the Conservation Groups\u2019 affidavit pertained only to alleged errors within DEQ\u2019s review of the permit for minor stationary emission sources. The affidavit did not assert that an entirely different permit process should be applied. Thus, because the Conservation Groups failed to set forth this new and different ground within 30 days as required by the statute, they were barred from amending their affidavit to include it. <em>See </em>\u00a7 75-2-211(10), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">\u00b648 Rule 15(c), M. R. Civ. P., fails to save the day because the Legislature has not applied the Rules of Civil Procedure to this particular process, as it has done for other statutory procedures. <em>See e.g. </em>\u00a7 49-2-204(2), MCA (\u201c[T]he department shall adopt all applicable portions of the Montana Rules of Civil Procedure ....\u201d). Thus, the Rules of Civil Procedure, as the Court recognizes, can at most provide \u201cguidance.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 20. What the Court fails to acknowledge, however, is that such guidance is only appropriate when the statute at issue does not specifically provide a different procedure. <em>See In re Estate of Spencer, </em>2002 MT 304, \u00b6\u00b6 12-13, 313 Mont. 40, 59 P.3d 1160 (The Rules of Civil Procedure are not to be interjected \u201cinto other statutory schemes which provide different procedural requirements.\u201d). Here, \u00a7 75-2-211(10), MCA, specifically controls the issue, directing \u201c[a]n affidavit <em>setting forth the grounds </em>for the request <em>must be </em>filed within 30 days.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Because the Conservation Groups failed to set forth their new claim within 30 days, \u00a7 75-2-211(10), MCA, requires denial of the amendment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">\u00b649 The Court rejects this position, insisting that it \u201cconflicts with our reasoning in <em>Simmons v. Mountain Bell, </em>246 Mont. 205, 207-09, 806 P.2d 6,7-8 (1990)\u201d and that this case is \u201canalogous.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 25-26. I disagree. The Court\u2019s reliance on <em>Simmons </em>is misplaced because \u00a7 49-2-501, MCA, the statute at issue in <em>Simmons, </em>is critically different than the statute before the Court here. Section 49-2-501, MCA, provided that \u201ca complaint under this chapter must be filed with the commission within 180 days after the alleged unlawful discriminatory practice occurred or was discovered.\u201d The statute thus provided a time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>deadline only for the filing of a document (i.e. a \u201ccomplaint\u201d), but provided no deadline or requirement governing the <em>content </em>of the document, as the statute does here. Absent statutory direction, it was entirely appropriate for the <em>Simmons </em>Court to consult Rule 15(c) to determine whether a complainant may add <em>new content </em>which would relate back. However, unlike the statute in <em>Simmons, </em>\u00a7 75-2-211(10), MCA, provides a deadline for both the document <em>and </em>restricts the content within that document. (\u201c[T]he <em>grounds </em>for the request must be filed within 30 days ....\u2019\u2019Section 75-2-211(10), MCA (emphasis added).) Allowing an amendment which adds <em>new claims </em>after the 30-day deadline, even from the same transaction or occurrence, contravenes this clear requirement and defeats the Legislature\u2019s intent to require the grounds for a claim to be filed within the stated period.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">\u00b650 Adhering to the statute at issue here and prohibiting amendments raising <em>new claims </em>after the 30-day deadline would not, as the Court states, forbid all amendments. <em>See </em>Opinion, \u00b6 28. Of course, prior to expiration of the 30-day deadline, any kind of amendment to the affidavit is permitted, even one setting forth entirely new grounds. <em>See </em>\u00a7 75-2-211(10), MCA. After the 30-day deadline, amendments which clarify or support claims timely filed would also be permissible. <em>See </em>\u00a7 75-2-211(10), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">\u00b651 The Court also cites to Rule 12(a), M. R. Civ. P., to support its position, reasoning from this Rule that the deadline for an answer \u201cdoes not preclude subsequent amendments\u201d to an answer filed in District Court and neither should \u00a7 75-2-211(10), MCA. Opinion, \u00b6 29. Even though, for the reasons discussed above, the Rules of Civil Procedure do not govern here, Rule 12(a) illustrates precisely why this Dissent is correct. Rule 12(a) provides that \u201c[a] defendant shall serve an answer within 20 days after the service of the summons and complaint upon that defendant\u201d and thus, like the statute at issue in <em>Simmons, </em>provides only for a filing deadline, and not a requirement as to content or amendment of content. Content is governed instead by Rule 15. Section 75-2-211(10), MCA, clearly operates differently than the Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">\u00b652 The Court has reached its decision by looking to other rules, treatises discussing administrative law generally, and cases interpreting different statutes-everything \u2022 but the wording of the actual statute at issue. The Court thus fails to enforce the specific requirements within the statute and the Legislature\u2019s desire to conduct a prompt proceeding. By such maneuvering, the Court has failed to heed the admonishment provided by the United States <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>Supreme Court in cases such as this:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-3\">Indeed, administrative proceedings should not be a game or a forum to engage in unjustified obstructionism by making cryptic and obscure reference to matters that \u201cought to be\u201d considered and then, after failing to do . more to bring the matter to the agency\u2019s attention, seeking to have that agency determination vacated on the ground that the agency failed to consider matters \u201cforcibly presented.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b105-4\"><em>Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. Nat. Resources Def. Council, Inc., </em>435 U.S. 519, 553-54, 98 S. Ct. 1197, 1217 (1978). Allowing an untimely amendment which raises a new issue not only violates the letter and spirit of the governing statute, but also incubates the kind of \u201cunjustified obstructionism\u201d about which the High Court warned. \u00b653 I would affirm the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
