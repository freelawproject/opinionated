We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-21\">\u00b62 M.C.D. contends on appeal that there was insufficient evidence to support the District Court\u2019s order committing him.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"AdH\">\u00b63 M.C.D. is a 75-year-old resident of Helena, Montana, who suffers from the mental disorder of progressive vascular dementia brought on by repeated trauma to the head and cardiovascular disease. In July, 2009, he stopped his car beside the road to defecate and was unable to stand afterwards because of weak knees. A good Samaritan stopped but was unable to help and called authorities. The fire department responded and took M.C.D. to the Veterans Administration Hospital at Ft. Harrison.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">\u00b64 Personnel at the VA hospital became concerned about M.C.D.\u2019s behavior and, after talking to his wife, attempted to keep him there. M.C.D. left the facility and went to a stepson\u2019s house. Police responded and returned him to the VA hospital. M.C.D. became angry at being kept at the hospital and VA security officers responded to assist staff. While M.C.D. was being taken into an elevator he grabbed one officer and hit the other but without inflicting any material injury. According to M.C.D.\u2019s description, he \u201cgot a hold of the little cop and I stuck it on the big cop.\u201d M.C.D. was placed in a secure locked room.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">\u00b65 The Lewis and Clark County Attorney petitioned the District Court to order M.C.D. committed to the Montana State Hospital at Warm Springs. The District Court held a hearing on July 10, 2009, at which witnesses testified, including M.C.D.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">\u00b66 Kim Waples, a licensed mental health professional on staff at the VA hospital, testified that M.C.D. exhibited symptoms of vascular dementia including \u201cbehavioral disturbances, memory impairment, disturbance in executive functioning and poor impulse control.\u201d Vascular dementia is a mental disorder caused by blockages of the blood supply to the brain. He also exhibited anger, irritation and depression and left the hospital against medical advice. Waples testified that M.C.D. stated to her that his wife should be afraid of him, especially if she did not respect him. He further stated to Waples that if his wife ever called the police he would kill her \u201cwith his bare hands.\u201d When Waples asked M.C.D. if he were just upset and using figures of speech, he stated: \u201cNo, I would kill her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">\u00b67 On the day of the District Court hearing Waples talked to M.C.D. again. He again stated to her that his wife \u201cbetter be afraid of me. She better fear me because if she doesn\u2019t-if she doesn\u2019t respect me, she better fear me.\u201d He stated that if she called the police it \u201cwould be the last phone call she ever made.\u201d Waples testified that these threatening statements were indicative of his vascular dementia and that he was an imminent threat to himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>\u00b68 Stephen Nagy, M.D., also testified that that M.C.D. suffers from vascular dementia and that he exhibited classic symptoms of the disorder including loss of brain functioning resulting in cognitive impairment. He testified that M.C.D.\u2019s refusal to recognize that he had a problem and his refusal to accept treatment exemplify the lack of insight and understanding characteristic of dementia. Dr. Nagy testified that the dementia prevents M.C.D. from understanding his need to take medication and prevents him from remembering to even take his medication or make decisions about it. He testified that M.C.D. needed more assessment and medical stabilization and that involuntary medication was required to protect him and the public. The Montana State Hospital at Warm Springs was the only, and therefore least restrictive, alternative available to meet his needs.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">\u00b69 This Court will disturb the district court\u2019s findings in a civil commitment case only if they are clearly erroneous, when viewed in a light most favorable to the prevailing party. <em>In the Matter of C.R.C., </em>2004 MT 389, \u00b6 11, 325 Mont. 133, 104 P.3d 1065. A finding is clearly erroneous if it is not supported by substantial evidence, if the trial court misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or if this Court has a definite and firm conviction after reviewing the record that a mistake has been made. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">\u00b610 A court considering a petition for civil commitment must determine whether the respondent is suffering from a mental disorder andifso whether he requires commitment. Section 53-21-126(1), MCA; <em>In the Matter of D.M.S., </em>2009 MT 41, \u00b6 15, 349 Mont. 257, 203 P.3d 776. If the district court determines that the respondent suffers from a mental disorder, commitment may be based on any of the following factors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-8\">(a) whether the respondent, because of a mental disorder, is substantially unable to provide for the respondent\u2019s own basic needs of food, clothing, shelter, health, or safety;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-9\">(b) whether the respondent has recently, because of a mental disorder and through an act or omission, caused self-injury or injury to others;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-10\">(c) whether, because of a mental disorder, there is an imminent threat of injury to the respondent or to others because of the respondent\u2019s acts or omissions; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>(d) whether the respondent\u2019s mental disorder, as demonstrated by the respondent\u2019s recent acts or omissions, will, if untreated, predictably result in deterioration of the respondent\u2019s mental condition to the point at which the respondent will become a danger to self or to others, or will be unable to provide for the respondent\u2019s own basic needs of food, clothing, shelter, health, or safety. Predictability may be established by the respondent\u2019s relevant medical history.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">Section 53-21-126(1), MCA. Imminent threat of injury to self or others must be proven by evidence of overt acts or omissions sufficiently recent in time as to be material and relevant to the respondent\u2019s present condition. Section 53-21-126(2), MCA. A threat of injury must be connected to the mental illness. <em>D.M.S., </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">\u00b611 M.C.D. does not contest the undisputed evidence in the record that he suffers from the mental disorder of vascular dementia. The record is also undisputed that symptoms of the mental disorder of vascular dementia include loss of brain functioning resulting in cognitive impairment, behavioral disturbances, memory impairment, poor impulse control, anger, irritation and depression. Therefore the issue was whether M.C.D.\u2019s mental disorder warranted commitment.</p>\n<p id=\"A8S\">\u00b6 12 The District Court found that M. C .D .\u2019s mental disorder of vascular dementia required commitment. The District Court relied upon both M.C.D.\u2019s fighting with the security officers at the VA hospital and his express threats to his wife\u2019s life, which were made as late as the day of the hearing, as indicative of the fact that he was an imminent threat to himself or others. The District Court found, based on the testimony of the mental health professionals, that M.C.D.\u2019s behavior was representative of and symptomatic of his mental disorder. A threat to kill another is an overt act sufficient to support a commitment on the ground that the respondent is an imminent danger to others. <em>In the Matter of Goedert, </em>180 Mont. 484, 486-87, 591 P.2d 222, 224 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"Azl\">\u00b613 M.C.D.\u2019s attempt to minimize his own threatening statements is ineffective. The fact that his wife was not present when M.C.D. stated the threats to Waples is immaterial to whether he was a threat to his wife. The seriousness of the threats is illustrated by the fact that mental health professionals are required by law to take precautions to provide protection when a person has communicated \u201can actual threat of physical violence by specific means against a clearly identified or reasonably identifiable victim.\u201d Section 27-1-1102, MCA. In this case M.C.D. communicated explicit threats to kill his wife if she did not respect him or if she called the police, and stated that he would do it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>with his bare hands. The lack of impulse control, insight and medical care brought on by M.C.D.\u2019s mental disorder were both a cause of these threats and evidence that the danger to his wife was real and imminent. An imminent threat can be shown without evidence of actual violence or physical harm. <em>In the Matter of the Mental Health of D.S., </em>2005 MT 152, \u00b6 15, 327 Mont. 391, 114 P.3d 264.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">\u00b614 Similarly, M.C.D. attempts to minimize his physical confrontation with the YA security officer. While the officer was younger and larger than M.C.D. and suffered no material injury from the altercation, the significance of the incident is that it illustrated how the effects of vascular dementia are exhibited in M.C.D\u2019s behavior. The incident shows that M.C.D. is combative when a person not suffering from dementia might not be, and that he could hurt someone who is not a larger, younger, stronger person or provoke such a person to hurt him. The confrontation with the officer was probative of the need for commitment.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">\u00b615 The District Court further found that M.C.D.\u2019s refusal to accept medical treatment, which Waples and Dr. Nagy testified arose from his mental disorder, indicated that he was unable to take care of his basic need for health and safety. The District Court found that M.C.D.\u2019s \u201caversion to medical treatment, agitation, anger, and hostility to his health care providers creates treatment difficulties and places his caregivers at risk of injury. The degenerative nature of M.C.D.\u2019s mental disorder coupled with his refusal to participate in medical treatment, created an imminent risk of injury to himself. The District Court found that M.C.D.\u2019s mental disorder prevents him from understanding the need to take medication and to ensure that his medical needs were being met.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">\u00b616  M.C.D. argues that there was no evidence that the threat of harm to himself or others or the inability to provide for his own care was \u201cbecause of\u2019 the mental disorder as required by \u00a7 53-21-126(4), MCA. To the contrary, the mental health professionals established without contradiction that M.C.D.\u2019s behaviors and symptoms that they were concerned about were all present because of the mental disorder. M.C.D. presentedno contradictory evidence. Therefore, based upon the facts presented to the District Court, the findings that M.C.D. suffered from a mental disorder and that he required commitment were supported by substantial evidence and were not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"A2Vt\">\u00b617 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b127-7\">JUSTICES WHEAT, COTTER, MORRIS and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
