The Division denied the Petitioners\u2019 motion, holding that the \u201cclearly inadequate or excessive\u201d standard under Rule 17, Mont. Sent. Rev. Div., correctly stated the appropriate standard of review. Petitioners then filed a Petition for Writ of Supervisory Control with this Court, asserting the Division was proceeding under a mistake of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-12\">\u00b62 We state the issues as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b300-13\">\u00b63 <em>1. Is the exercise of supervisory control appropriate in this </em>matter?</p>\n<p id=\"AMb\">\u00b64 <em>2. Did the Division err by denying Petitioners\u2019 motion to clarify the standard of review applicable to sentences reviewed by the Division ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b300-14\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b300-15\">\u00b65 Petitioners are criminal defendants who have petitioned or intend to petition the Division for review of their sentences. On January 9, 2009, Petitioners filed a motion before the Division requesting that the Division clarify the standard it applies to sentences submitted for review. Petitioners argued that the Division should declare that the \u201cclearly inadequate or excessive\u201d standard in Rule 17 of the Division\u2019s Rules \u201cis not the applicable standard.\u201d Instead, the motion asked that the Division \u201creview its cases for equity.\u201d On May 12, 2009, the Attorney General filed a response objecting to Petitioner\u2019s motion and arguing in support of the standard stated in Rule 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>\u00b66 The Division denied the motion, reaffirming Rule 17 as the appropriate standard of review and rejecting Petitioners\u2019 argument that their sentences should be reviewed for equity. In its order, the Division also stated that its \u201crules and practices ... have considered sentences to be unjust or inequitable if they are so greatly disproportionate to the crime as to constitute cruel and unusual punishment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\">\u00b67 Petitioners filed a Petition for Writ of Supervisory Control with this Court, arguing that the Division erred in denying its motion and was thus proceeding under a mistake of law. The State filed its response, agreeing that this was an appropriate case for the exercise of supervisory control by this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">JURISDICTION &amp; STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">\u00b68 We may assume supervisory control, as authorized by Article VII, Section 2(2) of the Montana Constitution and M. R. App. P. 14(3) (2007) (former M. R. App. P. 17), to control the course of litigation where the district court \u201cis proceeding under a mistake of law and is causing a gross injustice.\u201d M. R. App. P. 14(3)(a); <em>State v. Thirteenth Jud. Dist. Ct., </em>2009 MT 163, \u00b6 13, 350 Mont. 465, 208 P.3d 408; <em>see Sportsmen for I-143 v. Mont. Fifteenth Jud. Dist. Ct., </em>2002 MT 18, \u00b6 4, 308 Mont. 189, 40 P.3d 400 <em>(citing Park v. Mont. Sixth Jud. Dist. Ct., </em>1998 MT 164, \u00b6 13, 289 Mont. 367, 961 P.2d 1267). Our determination of whether supervisory control is appropriate is a case-by-case decision, based on the presence of extraordinary circumstances and a particular need to prevent an injustice from occurring. <em>Sportsmen for 1-143, </em>\u00b6 4 (citing <em>Park, </em>\u00b6 13).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">\u00b69 The proper basis by which this Court may review a challenge to a decision of the Sentence Review Division is through a petition for extraordinary relief. <em>Ranta v. State, </em>1998 MT 95, \u00b6 12, 288 Mont. 391, 958 P.2d 670. \u201cBecause the Sentence Review Division functions as an arm of this Court, this Court has the supervisory authority to ensure that it complies with statutes and rules governing its operations as well as the Montana Constitution and the United States Constitution.\u201d <em>Ranta, </em>\u00b6 12 (citing \u00a7 46-18-901(1), MCA; Mont. Const, art. VII, \u00a7 2). Pursuant to M. R. App. P. 14(1), this Court has the power to \u201chear and determine such original and remedial writs as may be necessary or proper to the complete exercise of its jurisdiction.\u201d <em>See Ranta, </em>\u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b301-9\">\u00b610 <em>1. Is the exercise of supervisory control appropriate in this </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number><em>matter?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">\u00b611 Petitioners contend that supervisory control is appropriate to correct the Division\u2019s mistake of law of applying the \u201cclearly inadequate or excessive\u201d standard to the review of sentences before it. The State agrees that supervisory control is appropriate, but requests that we do so to affirm that the \u201cclearly inadequate or excessive\u201d standard of review is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">\u00b612  We can exercise supervisory authority to ensure that the Division, as an arm of this Court, complies with the statutes and rules governing its operations, as well as the Montana Constitution and the United States Constitution. <em>Jordan v. State, </em>2008 MT 334, \u00b6 22, 346 Mont. 193, 194 P.3d 657 (quoting <em>Ranta, </em>\u00b6 12). Because we have exclusive jurisdiction to review the Division\u2019s compliance with governing statutes and rules, as well as state and federal constitutional mandates, <em>Jordan, </em>\u00b6 22 (citing <em>Ranta, </em>\u00b6 12), we deem this case appropriate for the exercise of supervisory control to resolve the issue raised by the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">\u00b613 <em>2. Did the Division err by denying Petitioners\u2019 motion to clarify the standard of review applicable to sentences reviewed by the Division?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">\u00b614 In its order, the Division agreed with Petitioners\u2019 observation that the Legislature did not articulate a standard of review within the statutes creating and governing the Sentence Review Division. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 46-18-901 through 905, MCA(2007). However, noting that the statutes granted it authority to \u201cadopt any rules that will expedite its review of sentences,\u201d \u00a7 46-18-901(4), MCA, the Division cited its purpose and standards for review of criminal sentences as set forth in Rules 16 and 17. The Division rejected Petitioners\u2019 assertion that sentences should be reviewed for abuse of discretion or equity, and affirmed the standard set forth in Rule 17, that sentences \u201cwill not be reduced or increased unless it is deemed clearly inadequate or excessive.\u201d Acknowledging that sentences may be challenged as \u201cunjust or inequitable,\u201d the Division appeared to define this review narrowly by holding that \u201c[t]he rules and practices of this division have considered sentences to be unjust or inequitable if they are so greatly disproportionate to the crime as to constitute cruel and unusual punishment.\u201d The Division stated that this Court \u201capproved such analysis in <em>In re Jones,\u201d </em>176 Mont. 412, 587 P.2d 1150 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-8\">\u00b615 Petitioners contend that the \u201cclearly inadequate or excessive\u201d standard of Rule 17 \u201cunnecessarily limits the Division\u2019s reviewing power\u201d and contradicts statements made by this Court that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>Division \u201cwill review sentences for equity.\u201d <em>See State v. Herd, </em>2004 MT 85, \u00b6 22, 320 Mont. 490, 87 P.3d 1017. They note that this standard is not stated within the Division\u2019s statutory authorization. During oral argument, Petitioners focused their argument on the language within the Division\u2019s order which appeared to define inequitable sentences as only those which constitute cruel and unusual punishment. Petitioners argue that the Division should review for equity \u201cin the broadest sense of the word, so the Division may review everything encompassing a defendant\u2019s sentence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\">\u00b616 The State, during argument, agreed that the language within the Division\u2019s order purporting to limit review to sentences constituting cruel and unusual punishment was unduly narrow. However, the State argues that the Division\u2019s adoption of the \u201cclearly inadequate or excessive\u201d standard under Rule 17, pursuant to its statutory authority to promulgate rules, was an appropriate application of the statutory directive that \u201c[t]he sentence imposed by the district court is presumed correct.\u201d Section 46-18-904(3), MCA. The State acknowledges that the Division may take into account \u201cequity issues\u201d and \u201cconsiderations of justice,\u201d but that its primary role is the reduction of disparities in prisoner sentencing, noting Rule 16\u2019s statement that the primary objective of the Division \u201cis to provide uniformity in sentencing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">\u00b617 Montana law provides for generalized, indiscriminate sentencing of criminal defendants, with term ranges and broad authority for sentencing courts to impose conditions. \u201cOne of the purposes of the 1973 Montana Criminal Code was to vest wide sentencing discretion in the trial judge who is familiar with the character and past record of the defendant, and with the circumstances of the particular case.\u201d <em>State v. Maldonado, </em>176 Mont. 322, 334, 578 P.2d 296, 303 (1978). \u201c[I]n imposing sentence, the sentencing court may consider any relevant evidence relating to the nature and circumstances of the crime, the character of the defendant, the defendant\u2019s background history, mental and physical condition, and any evidence the court considers to have probative force.\u201d <em>State v. Collier, </em>277 Mont. 46, 63, 919 P.2d 376, 387 (1996) <em>(citing State v. Klippenstein, </em>239 Mont. 42, 45, 778 P.2d 892, 894 (1989)). \u201cThe District Court is given a wide scope of inquiry in sentencing.\u201d <em>Klippenstein, </em>239 Mont. at 45, 778 P.2d at 894 (citing <em>State v. D.B.S., </em>216 Mont. 234, 247-48, 700 P.2d 630, 639-40 (1985)).</p>\n<p id=\"AqO\">\u00b618 The Legislature \u201cvoluntarily created\u201d the Division, <em>State ex rel. Holt v. Dist. Ct., </em>2000 MT 142, \u00b6 12, 300 Mont. 35, 3 P.3d 608, to serve essentially as a safety net for our indiscriminate sentencing system, providing additional protection for both the public and for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>individual defendant. The Division was created to review sentences challenged as being unjust or inequitable and \u201cwas charged with determining the appropriateness of criminal sentences with respect to the individual offender and a particular offense.\u201d <em>Jordan, </em>\u00b6 18 (citations omitted). To assist in accomplishing this purpose, the Legislature granted the Division authority to \u201cadopt any rules that will expedite its review of sentences.\u201d Section 46-18-901(4), MCA; <em>Holt, </em>\u00b6 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">\u00b619 Rule 16, Mont. Sent. Rev. Div., provides that \u201c[t]he primary objective of the Sentence Review Division is to provide for uniformity in sentencing when appropriate\u201d and to \u201censure that the interest of the public and the defendant are adequately addressed by the sentence.\u201d Regarding the public\u2019s interests, Rule 16 provides the Division shall consider the State\u2019s correctional policy \u201cto protect society by preventing crime,\u201d will \u201chold an individual responsible and accountable for his/her actions,\u201d and remove \u201cdangerous and habitual offenders from society.\u201d Regarding the defendant\u2019s interests, the rule instructs that the Division \u201cshall ensure that persons convicted of crime are dealt with in accordance with their individual characteristics, circumstances, needs and potentialities,\u201d and shall consider \u201cwhether the offender could have been dealt with adequately by probation, suspended sentence orfine ....\u2019\u2019The rule directs that the Division\u2019s review consider various factors, including the crime committed, the offender\u2019s prospect of rehabilitation, the circumstances of the crime, and the criminal history of the offender. Rule 15 requires the Division to review the record in the case, including pleadings, plea agreements, pre-sentence reports, judgments and \u201c[ojther documents relied on by the sentencing judge.\u201d The Division\u2019s review is procedurally governed by Rule 14 which provides that proceedings before the Division \u201cshall be as informal as possible to allow full expression by all parties and their attorneys. The Rules of Evidence will serve as a guide but are not binding in the proceeding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">\u00b620 These rules together provide for an appropriately broad review of the totality of the facts and circumstances of each case, which we have previously described as a review \u201cfor equity, disparity, or considerations of justice by the Sentence Review Board.\u201d <em>State v. Stephens, </em>198 Mont. 140, 145, 645 P.2d 387, 390-91 (1982). The Division\u2019s consideration is not cabined by rigid guidelines, and a defendant can rightly appeal to the Division\u2019s judges on equitable grounds such as fairness, consistency and uniformity, as can the State.</p>\n<p id=\"ABQg\">\u00b621  Section 46-18-904(3), MCA, provides that \u201c[t]he sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>imposed by the district court is presumed correct.\u201d Thus, after hearing evidence and argument, the Division must decide whether this presumption has been overcome and a new sentence should be imposed, \u201cincluding a decrease or increase in the penalty.\u201d Section 46-18-904(l)(a)(ii), MCA. The Division does so by determining, after its broad review, whether the original sentence was \u201cclearly inadequate or excessive\u201d under Rule 17. Although Petitioners criticize this standard, they conceded during argument that Rule 17 is not inconsistent with the statutes governing the Division, and we cannot conclude otherwise. Further, we cannot conclude that the Rule exceeds the Division\u2019s authority. Simple \u201cequity\u201d cannot serve as the standard of review, as the Legislature did not intend for the Division to engage in de novo sentencing. Indeed, we have held that the Division \u201cunder Montana\u2019s procedure may not substitute its discretion for the district court\u2019s. Instead, the sentence imposed by the district court is presumed correct <em>...\u201dRanta, </em>\u00b6 23 (citing \u00a7 46-18-904(3), MCA, and Rule 17, Mont. Sent. Rev. Div.). Further, the Division\u2019s interpretation of applicable governing statutes \u201cis entitled to deference and respect because the Division is charged by the legislature with the administration of Montana\u2019s sentence review statutes.\u201d <em>Holt, </em>\u00b6 10 (citing <em>State v. Midland Materials Co., </em>204 Mont. 65, 70, 662 P.2d 1322, 1325 (1983)). Therefore, we conclude Rule 17 is a valid application of the Division\u2019s statutory duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">\u00b622 This analysis of the Division\u2019s standard of review undermines the statement in the Division\u2019s order to the effect that sentences would be considered unjust or inequitable \u201cif they are so greatly disproportionate to the crime as to constitute cruel and unusual punishment,\u201d citing <em>Jones. </em>In <em>Jones, </em>we merely mentioned the Division\u2019s determination to leave Jones\u2019s sentence unchanged as one reason we were rejecting Jones\u2019s cruel and unusual punishment claim. <em>Jones, </em>176 Mont. at 420, 578 P.2d at 1154-55. We were not indicating that the scope of the Division\u2019s review was limited to sentences which were cruel and unusual, as that is certainly incorrect. To that extent, then, the Division\u2019s order is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">\u00b623 Accordingly, we accept supervisory control in this matter, and correct the Division\u2019s order as stated herein.</p>\n<judges id=\"b305-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES WHEAT, COTTER, LEAPHART and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b305-7\">JUSTICE NELSON,</author>\n<p id=\"Ar8\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">\u00b624 I cannot understand what it is that the Court is holding in its Opinion. I do not agree that the \u201cclearly inadequate or excessive\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>standard used by the Sentence Review Division (SRD) complies with the criteria that we appear nominally to mandate in today\u2019s Opinion for sentence review. And I am not satisfied, in any event, that any standard which either this Court or SRD adopts makes any sense in the absence of a readily accessible database of statewide sentencing statistics.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">\u00b625 To begin with, it is not clear what standard, exactly, we are adopting for sentence review. On one hand, the Court reverses SRD\u2019s order that sentences would be considered unjust or inequitable \u201cif they are so greatly disproportionate to the crime as to constitute cruel and unusual punishment.\u201d <em>See </em>Opinion, \u00b6 22. I agree with the Court\u2019s decision in this regard and with the limitation the Court places on the language of <em>In re Jones, </em>176 Mont. <em>412, 578 </em>P.2d 1150 (1978), from which SRD adopted this standard. Opinion, \u00b6 22. Furthermore, I do not take issue with the Court\u2019s statements in \u00b6 17 regarding the broad authority and discretion granted by statute to district courts in sentencing matters.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Nor do I disagree that SRD was created to serve as a \u201csafety net\u201d against \u201cunjust\u201d and \u201cinequitable\u201d sentences imposed upon individual offenders for particular offenses. Opinion, \u00b6 18. Finally, I agree that SRD\u2019s review \u201cis not cabined by rigid guidelines\u201d and that SRD must consider a defendant\u2019s petition for sentence review on \u201cequitable grounds\u201d such as \u201cfairness, consistency and uniformity.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">\u00b626 Yet, on the other hand, and in the face of having said all of the foregoing, the Court summarily concludes that since the sentence imposed by the district court is presumed correct, SRD\u2019s \u201cclearly inadequate or excessive\u201d standard is \u201ca valid application of [SRD\u2019s] statutory duty\u201d to review petitions for sentence review. Opinion, \u00b6 21. I do not agree that the rigid \u201cclearly inadequate or excessive\u201d standard incorporates the notions of \u201cfairness\u201d and \u201cequity\u201d that the Court appears nominally to mandate earlier in its Opinion, as noted above. Thus, in holding as it does, the Court implicitly overrules (unfortunately, without citation to the many cases affected, <em>see </em>\u00b6 34 &amp; n. 2, infra) our well-established and extensive caselaw that, until <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>today, required SRD to review sentences for \u201cequity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">\u00b627 So, where does that leave the law? Apparently the \u201cprimary objective\u201d of SRD is to ensure \u201cuniformity in sentencing.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 19. But SRD may also (as the State acknowledges) \u201ctake into account \u2018equity issues\u2019 and \u2018considerations of justice,\u2019 \u201d Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 16, 20, including \u201cfairness\u201d and \u201cconsistency,\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 20. Yet, under SRD\u2019s \u201cclearly inadequate or excessive\u201d standard, this \u201cprimary objective\u201d cannot be achieved through review for simple \u201cequity,\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 21, even though SRD may consider equity issues, Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 16, 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">\u00b628 There are two problems here. First, the parties, and now this Court, casually throw out terms and phrases without regard to what they actually mean. Second, as noted, this case convinces me that no entity in the criminal justice system has any way of actually determining whether sentences handed down by the district courts are \u201cuniform,\u201d much less consistent, equitable, fair, just, or proportionate.</p>\n<p id=\"AdV\">\u00b629 With respect to terminology, <em>\u201cuniformity </em>in sentencing\u201d contemplates that sentences will be characterized by a lack of variation; that they will be identical or consistent. <em>See Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1668 (Bryan A. Garner ed., 9th ed., West 2009). However, as noted, both the State and this Court qualify this exacting standard with the requirement that sentencing courts take into account <em>\u201cequity </em>issues.\u201d Equity broadly contemplates fairness, impartiality, and evenhandedness. <em>See Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>619. Moreover, both the State and this Court further qualify the uniformity standard by requiring sentencing courts to take into account \u201cconsiderations of <em>justice.\u201d </em>That which is just is legally right, lawful, and equitable. <em>See Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>942. Finally, even SRD acknowledges that it has an obligation to reduce disparities in the sentencing of prisoners. Disparity means inequality, i.e., \u201ca difference in quantity or quality between two or more things.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>538. Thus, using the terminology the Court adopts, it appears that the \u201cprimary objective\u201d of SRD is, at one and the same time, to review sentences for a lack of variation; for fairness, impartiality, and evenhandedness; for legality and equity; and for differences in quantity and quality as compared with other sentences imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">\u00b630 Yet, SRD\u2019s Rule 17 states that a sentence will be reviewed to determine whether it is \u201cclearly inadequate or excessive.\u201d \u201cClear\u201d means \u201c[f]ree from doubt; sure.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>287. \u201cInadequate\u201d means \u201cinsufficient.\u201d <em>Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary </em>586 (10th ed., Merriam-Webster 1997). \u201cExcessive\u201d means \u201cgoing beyond a normal limit.\u201d <em>Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number><em>Dictionary </em>404. Thus, under Rule 17, SRD reviews a sentence to determine whether the sentence, without doubt, is insufficient or goes beyond the normal limit.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">\u00b631 In my view, SRD\u2019s power of \u201cbroad review,\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 21, applying the nuanced terminology that this Court has adopted, cannot be squared with or accomplished under the \u201cclearly inadequate or excessive\u201d standard. \u201cClearly inadequate or excessive\u201d contemplates that a much wider range of sentences will be found appropriate than under an \u201cequity\u201d and \u201cfairness\u201d standard. Indeed, any <em>lawful </em>sentence (i.e., one that falls within the parameters set by statute, <em>see State v. Grana, </em>2009 MT 250, \u00b6 11, 351 Mont. 499, 213 P.3d 783) would pass muster. But a sentence certainly can be non-uniform, inconsistent, unfair, and inequitable without being \u201cclearly inadequate or excessive.\u201d In sum, while the Court nominally imposes a broad standard of sentence review, it then allows SRD to apply another standard that is much narrower and more constrained.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">\u00b632 More to the point, while \u00a7 46-18-901(4), MCA, allows SRD to adopt rules that will \u201cexpedite its review of sentences,\u201d no provision of Title 46, chapter 18, part 9, MCA, suggests or permits the \u201cclearly inadequate or excessive\u201d standard adopted by SRD. Indeed, SRD functions as an arm of this Court, \u00a7 46-18-901(1), MCA; <em>Ranta v. State, </em>1998 MT 95, \u00b6 27, 288 Mont. 391, 958 P.2d 670, and this Court has required SRD to review sentences \u201con equitable grounds,\u201d <em>Ranta, </em>\u00b6 27; <em>State v. Triplett, </em>2008 MT 360, \u00b6 27, 346 Mont. 383, 195 P.3d 819. But yet now we require SRD to somehow conduct that review for equity, Opinion, \u00b6 20, without actually reviewing for simple equity, Opinion, \u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">\u00b633 Indeed, the Court\u2019s Opinion is internally inconsistent on this point and, ultimately, will only engender confusion regarding the appropriate standard that SRD is to apply. First, as noted, the Court tells us that SRD \u201cwas created to review sentences challenged as being unjust or inequitable,\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 18, and that SRD \u201cmay take into account \u2018equity issues,\u2019 \u201d Opinion, \u00b6 16. Indeed, the Court reaffirms that SRD \u201creview[s] \u2018for equity,\u2019 \u201d Opinion, \u00b6 20 (quoting <em>State v. Stephens, </em>198 Mont. 140, 145, 645 P.2d 387, 390 (1982)), and that a defendant \u201ccan rightly appeal to [SRD\u2019s] judges on equitable grounds,\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 20. But then the Court inexplicably follows all of this with its holding in \u00b6 21 that \u201c[s]imple \u2018equity cannot serve as the standard of review.\u201d Obviously, \u201cequity\u201d cannot simultaneously be both part of the calculus and not part of the calculus-except, perhaps, in the world of quantum physics, <em>cf. Denke v. Shoemaker, </em>2008 MT 418, \u00b6 78 &amp; n. 2, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>347 Mont. 322, 198 P.3d 284.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\">\u00b634 This Court has stated repeatedly that we will not review a criminal sentence for equity because that is the responsibility of SRD.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, to the extent the Court really means what it says in \u00b6 21 (i.e., that \u201c[s]imple \u2018equity\u2019 cannot serve as the standard of review\u201d), which in turn means that the myriad cases which hold that SRD reviews sentences \u201cfor equity\u201d are no longer good law, then two possibilities follow: first, no one reviews sentences for equity after today\u2019s decision; or second, this Court now must review sentences for equity. The only reason we have not been doing so is because we assumed that SRD was reviewing for equity. In <em>State v. Herd, </em>2004 MT 85, \u00b6 22, 320 Mont. 490, 87 P.3d 1017, we explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-5\">Henceforth, if an offender is eligible for Sentence Review-in other words, if the offender is sentenced to one year or more of actual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>incarceration-this Court will... review such a sentence for legality only. It will be left in these cases to SRD to review sentences for equity. However, if an offender is statutorily ineligible for SRD, then this Court will utilize the two-tiered approach which we employed prior to the creation of SRD. Upon request, we will review such sentences for both legality <em>and </em>abuse of discretion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AgL\">Under this logic, it follows that because SRD no longer reviews sentences for equity, as the Court apparently holds in \u00b6 21, that task will now fall back on us. <em>See also Ranta v. State, </em>1998 MT 95, \u00b6 27,288 Mont. 391, 958 P.2d 670 (\u201cWere the legislature to abolish [SRD], the function of reviewing sentences on equitable grounds would thus simply return to this Court.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">\u00b635 In sum, if SRD actually has the broad power of review the Court says it has, Opinion, \u00b6 20, then this power cannot be fully exercised through a standard that limits the question before SRD to whether the sentence is \u201cclearly inadequate or excessive.\u201d But if SRD is in fact to be so limited in its review, such that \u201c[s]imple \u2018equity\u2019 cannot serve as the standard of review,\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 21, then the following new procedures will have to be observed: this Court will review a sentence for legality and equity, <em>see Herd, </em>\u00b6 22; <em>Ranta, </em>\u00b6 27, and SRD will perform its limited review to determine if the sentence is \u201cclearly inadequate or excessive.\u201d Correspondingly, our \u201creview for equity\u201d cases have evidently been overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">\u00b636 That being said, even assuming (for the sake of argument) that the components of the Court\u2019s Opinion and SRD\u2019s Rule 17 could be reconciled in some sensible and practical way, this entire discussion is largely academic in any event. As stated above, SRD functions as \u201can arm of this Court.\u201d <em>Ranta, </em>\u00b6 27. Yet, this Court does not monitor SRD\u2019s decisions to ensure that it is achieving its \u201cprimary objective\u2019-however that is now characterized. There is no right to appeal SRD\u2019s decisions to this Court. <em>See </em>\u00a7 46-18-905(1), MCA. Thus, if SRD is truly \u201can arm of this Court,\u201d then surely the left hand has no idea what the right hand is routinely doing.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">\u00b637 The problem is that the district courts, this Court, and SRD are not provided with statewide sentencing statistics that would allow a reasoned analysis and determination of (a) the \u201cuniformity in sentencing\u201d of criminal defendants in this state, and whether such sentences are consistent, equitable, fair, just, and proportionate, and (b) whether SRD is achieving its \u201cprimary objective\u201d-again, however that is characterized. Even assuming that these statistics could be piecemealed together from various sources, all parties concede that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>this sort of statistical data is not accessible in any comprehensive, readily available, or easily usable form. These sorts of data and statistics are not routinely supplied in report form to the district courts, to this Court, or to SRD.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">\u00b638 Accordingly, I am at a loss to understand how uniformity or equity in sentencing can be achieved. Both uniformity and equity presuppose the ability to make informed comparisons across the spectrum of data for which consistency, fairness, and evenhandedness are sought. Neither the district courts nor this Court nor SRD can presently make those sorts of informed comparisons. Uniformity and equity, as well as inadequacy and excessiveness, beg the question: \u201cCompared to what?\u201d Without the ability to make informed comparisons using a reliable spectrum of statistics and data, these standards produce little more than wholly subjective, ad hoc determinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">\u00b639 Whether sentences are to be reviewed for \u201cuniformity,\u201d taking into account \u201cequity issues\u201d and \u201cconsiderations of justice,\u201d with the goal of reducing \u201cdisparities in prisoner sentencing,\u201d or are to be reviewed for \u201cclear inadequacy or excessiveness,\u201d and if the district courts are expected to sentence with these requirements in mind, then a readily accessible database should be created to provide statistical information on a statewide basis for sentences handed down for various crimes and offenders. This information should routinely be made available in report form to the district courts, to this Court, and to SRD. Hopefully, this Court, the Attorney General, the Department of Corrections-or all three-will pursue funding and legislative authority for the creation of such a capability in the next legislative session.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">\u00b640 In the meantime, I would grant the Appellate Defender\u2019s Petition for Writ of Supervisory Control and order SRD to amend its Rule 17 to provide, consistent with our caselaw and the purposes of SRD, that it will review sentences for \u201cuniformity,\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 19, taking into account \u201cequity issues,\u201d \u201cconsiderations of justice,\u201d \u201cfairness,\u201d and \u201cconsistency,\u201d Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 16, 20.1 dissent from the Court\u2019s failure to do so.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b306-6\"> Notwithstanding, however, that this Court seems to be increasingly content-or perhaps determined-to chip away at this broad sentencing discretion by turning some sentencing decisions over to the correctional system\u2019s bureaucracy. <em>See e.g. State v.
