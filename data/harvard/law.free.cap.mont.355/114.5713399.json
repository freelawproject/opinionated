We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">\u00b62 Did the District Court err by denying Shepard\u2019s motion to withdraw her guilty pleas based upon an alleged breach of the plea agreement?</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b141-9\">\u00b63 On August 7, 2003, Shepard was charged with multiple offenses, including deliberate homicide, burglary, and aggravated kidnapping, arising out of her involvement in the murder of Steven Ash and attempted crimes against Caleb Russell. In April of 2004, Shepard executed and filed an Acknowledgement of Rights and Plea Agreement which she had entered into with the State. Pursuant to this agreement, Shepard appeared before the District Court and entered guilty pleas to the deliberate homicide and burglary charges, and the State moved for dismissal of the remaining charges. The agreement provided that the State was \u201cfree to recommend any sentence permitted by law ... excluding a sentence of death,\u201d except that the State agreed to recommend that any sentence imposed for the burglary offense would be served concurrently with the sentence imposed for deliberate homicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-10\">\u00b64 Prior to sentencing, Assistant Attorney General John Connor (Connor), who was assisting in the prosecution of the case, informed Shepard\u2019s defense counsel that he intended to seek imposition of a life sentence, but he did not intend to recommend a parole eligibility restriction. The plea agreement contained no commitment from the State regarding a parole eligibility restriction, although it acknowledged that the court could impose one. Consistent with his verbal assurance, Connor stated at the sentencing hearing that the \u201cState does not recommend that there be a no parole restriction placed on [Shepard\u2019s] sentence ....\u201d However, in addition to imposing a life sentence for the deliberate homicide offense, the District Court also made Shepard ineligible for parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-11\">\u00b65 Shepard appealed to this Court, asserting that her sentence was illegal because the parole restriction violated her constitutional and statutory rights. We affirmed the District Court\u2019s imposition of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>parole restriction. <em>State v. Shepard, </em>2006 MT 251N. Shepard then petitioned the Sentence Review Division for review of her sentence. At a hearing before the Sentence Review Division on October 5, 2007, Shepard, through counsel, described the factual circumstances surrounding her sentencing and argued that the District Court\u2019s parole ineligibility condition made her sentence excessive, unnecessary, and inappropriate. Robert Zimmerman (Zimmerman), who was Sanders County Attorney at the time of Shepard\u2019s sentencing, appeared before the Division as a witness. He contradicted the factual background given by Shepard and opposed Shepard\u2019s request that the parole restriction be removed from her sentence. Shepard objected to Zimmerman\u2019s statement and argued that it constituted a breach of the plea agreement because it ran counter to Connor\u2019s commitment not to recommend a restriction on Shepard\u2019s parole eligibility. In its Order of October 25, 2007, the Division overruled Shepard\u2019s objection, declined to remove the restriction, and determined the sentence should stand as imposed by the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">\u00b66 On November 24, 2008, Shepard filed a motion to withdraw her guilty pleas, asserting that Zimmerman\u2019s request that the Sentence Review Division leave Shepard\u2019s sentence as imposed constituted a breach of the plea agreement and that, therefore, her pleas were involuntary. On April 16, 2009, the District Court denied Shepard\u2019s motion. The court mentioned that the motion was untimely<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and held that Shepard\u2019s challenge was essentially to the decision of the Sentence Review Division, that she made no argument that she did not obtain the benefit of her bargain under the plea agreement, and that the sentence became law of the case at the time of imposition and was beyond that court\u2019s power of review. Shepard appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">\u00b67 The standard of review for a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to withdraw a guilty plea is de novo. <em>State v. Brinson, </em>2009 MT 200, \u00b6 3, 351 Mont. 136, 210 P.3d 164 (citation omitted). Acknowledging that we have held that a district court\u2019s determination about whether a plea agreement was breached is reviewed for abuse of discretion, <em>State v. Rahn, </em>2008 MT 201, \u00b6 8, 344 Mont. 110, 187 P.3d 622 (citation omitted), Shepard nonetheless argues that a de novo review for correctness should be the appropriate standard in such cases. She <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>argues that the abuse of discretion standard can be traced to <em>State v. Sullivan, </em>266 Mont. 313, 880 P.2d 829 (1994), which involved, not a plea agreement, but an evidentiary question, and that a de novo review would be consistent with this Court\u2019s review of civil contract cases. The State cites the same authority and argues for application of an abuse of discretion review of the District Court\u2019s conclusion that the agreement was not breached.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\">\u00b68 We agree with Shepard. We have held that a plea agreement is a contract and is subject to contract law standards. <em>State v. Hill, </em>2009 MT 134, \u00b6 49, 350 Mont. 296,207 P.3d 307. Based upon facts as determined by the fact-finder, the question of whether a contract was breached is a question of law which we review de novo. That standard is likewise consistent with the standard of review for motions to withdraw plea, at issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">\u00b69 <em>\u201cWe </em>will affirm a district court decision when it reaches the right result, even though its reasoning is not entirely correct.\u201d <em>State v. Hendershot, </em>2009 MT 292, \u00b6 33, 352 Mont. 271, 216 P.3d 754 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">\u00b610 <em>Did the District Court err in denying Shepard\u2019s motion to withdraw her guilty pleas ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">\u00b611 As a threshold matter, the parties dispute whether the plea agreement prohibited the State from taking a position on parole eligibility. The State argues that the parole eligibility restriction \u201cwas clearly not part of the written Plea Agreement\u201d and that \u201c[i]t is certainly subject to debate whether John Connor\u2019s decision to share his proposed sentencing recommendation with defense counsel in advance of the change of plea hearing rises to the level of an oral amendment to the written Plea Agreement.\u201d Shepard argues in reply that there was an unwritten \u201cunderstanding\u201d between the parties, which was communicated to the sentencing court, about the State not recommending a parole restriction. Further, Shepard argues that, in any event, the State took the position before the District Court within this proceeding that the understanding was part of the plea agreement, and should not be allowed to change its position on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-9\">\u00b612  It is well settled that \u201c[a] party may not change its theory on appeal from that advanced in the trial court; nor may a party raise an argument for the first time on appeal.\u201d <em>State v. Anderson, </em>1999 MT 60, \u00b6 25, 293 Mont. 490, 977 P.2d 983 (citation omitted). We thus agree with Shepard. Given the position taken by the State before the District Court on Shepard\u2019s motion to withdraw her pleas, we conclude for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>purposes of this appeal that an unwritten understanding between the parties was reached prior to sentencing that the State would make no recommendation about parole eligibility as part of its sentencing recommendations under the plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">\u00b613 The State next argues that <em>\u201ca </em>breach of plea agreement claim should not be viable after a judgment has become final, following a direct appeal of that judgment.\u201d Citing the statutes and rules governing final judgments, the State argues that Shepard\u2019s judgment became final in January 2007, and at that point \u201cit was not possible for the State to breach the Plea Agreement, by which it had already abided.\u201d Shepard replies that this position is unsupported by authority and contends that the sentence review process \u201cis essentially a continuation of the sentencing stage in the district court.\u201d Shepard argues that \u201cthe [Sjtate\u2019s agreement not to take a position with regard to a restriction on parole eligibility must be construed as extending to any review by the Sentence Review Division.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">\u00b614  We disagree with the State\u2019s argument that the plea agreement had no viability, as a matter of law, following Shepard\u2019s judgment becoming final. First, it is conceivable that an agreement could be negotiated which specifically restricts the State\u2019s actions before the Sentence Review Division or otherwise extends beyond the entry of judgment and appeal, and be a continuing obligation upon the State. \u201c[A] plea agreement is a contract between the State and a defendant and is subject to contract law standards.\u201d <em>State v. Rardon, </em>2002 MT 345, \u00b6 18, 313 Mont. 321, 61 P.3d 132 (citation omitted). Contract law principles require that \u201c[wlhere the contractual language is clear and unambiguous on its face, it is this Court\u2019s duty to enforce the contract as drafted and executed by the parties.\u201d <em>Felska v. Goulding, </em>238 Mont. 224, 230, 776 P.2d 530, 534 (1989) (citation omitted). Here, however, the plea agreement was drafted to unambiguously apply to the sentencing process before the District Court and that court\u2019s disposition of the case. It did not contemplate later proceedings, and thus, the State did not violate an express provision of the plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">\u00b615 Secondly, it is also conceivable that the State, by arguing for a different or harsher sentence before the Sentence Review Division than it had agreed to, could undermine and therefore violate the plea agreement. Prosecutors \u201c\u2018must meet strict and meticulous standards of both promise and performance\u2019 relating to plea <em>agreements....\u201dRardon, </em>\u00b6 18 (citation omitted). Here, following Shepard\u2019s presentation before the Division, Zimmerman began his comments by stating \u201c[a]s I stand here today listening to this, I was amazed how the facts of the case were glossed over and not brought up.\u201d He then detailed the facts of the crime, building to his conclusion that \u201c[t]his was premeditated, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>planned.\u201d Shepard\u2019s counsel then objected, arguing that the State was limited to only referring to the facts contained in the affidavit in support of the Information and was bound by the plea agreement, and thus could not offer facts to defend the sentencing court\u2019s imposition of a parole restriction. Zimmerman then responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-4\">I don\u2019t see it that way whatsoever. The facts are the facts and that was with both sides. The Court knew all of those facts based on the pre-sentence report, not only the affidavit that it had in front of it at the time. I guess the State did agree that we would recommend a life sentence and everybody was aware that the victim\u2019s family was going to recommend that the Court impose the no possibility of parole sanction. Everybody went into that with their eyes wide open knowing that that would happen. The State did go along with the plea agreement and we supported the plea agreement. And now we\u2019re here to support the judge\u2019s sentence. It\u2019s not violating the terms of the plea agreement whatsoever. We followed through with the plea agreement and that agreement ended at the time the sentencing took place. If you feel I\u2019m wrong, I\u2019ll sit back down.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">The Division overruled defense counsel\u2019s objection, and allowed Zimmerman to finish his comments, which he did briefly.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">\u00b616 We do not believe Zimmerman\u2019s comments undermined or constituted a breach of the plea agreement. Shepard knew that the plea agreement was not binding upon the District Court and; following the State\u2019s recommendation to the District Court in accordance with the plea agreement, the District Court imposed a legal sentence. Zimmerman was simply arguing to the Division that Shepard\u2019s sentence, as legally imposed, should be upheld. Moreover, a prosecutor is not required to sit idly by during a sentence review hearing if a defendant or counsel fails to accurately represent the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">\u00b617  Having concluded that the State did not breach the plea agreement, Shepard\u2019s argument that the District Court erred in denying her motion to withdraw the guilty pleas becomes -unsupported. Although Shepard points to errors in the District Court\u2019s analysis, we need not discuss these further, given our conclusion. Further, we \u201caffirm a district court decision when it reaches the right result, even though its reasoning is not entirely correct.\u201d <em>Hendershot, </em>\u00b6 33 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">\u00b618 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b145-9\">JUSTICES NELSON, LEAPHART, WHEAT, COTTER and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b142-7\"> The parties essentially agree that the District Court, although mentioning the timeliness issue, did not decide the motion on that ground. Thus, we do not take up that question. The State argues that we simply consider the time delay in determining the merits of Shepard\u2019s motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
