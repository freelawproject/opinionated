We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">\u00b63 This case arises from the failed placement of M.S., an Indian child, in the foster care of Jewel Hanna, an enrolled member of the Fort Peck Indian Tribes. At all times relevant to this case, Hanna has resided in Poplar, Montana, within the external boundaries of the Fort Peck Indian Reservation.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-9\">\u00b64 M.S. was born in Minnesota and was in foster case since birth. The State of Minnesota had terminated the parental rights of M.S.\u2019s birth parents and assumed legal custody. Pursuant to the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA), 25 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1901-1963 (2006), a central policy of which is to promote placement of Indian children removed from their families in foster and adoptive homes that reflect Indian values and culture, Minnesota sought to place M.S. with Hanna, who is M.S.\u2019s great aunt.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-10\">\u00b65 Because Minnesota sought to place M.S. in a foster home in Montana, the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children (ICPC) governed. Section 41-4-101, art. Ill, MCA. As DPHHS administers Montana\u2019s obligations as a receiving state under ICPC, \u00a7 41-4-104, MCA, DPHHS had to approve the foster placement, \u00a7 41-4-104, art. 111(4), MCA. After conducting a home study and background investigation, DPHHS approved placing M.S. with Hanna. In July 2004 DPHHS licensed Hanna as a kinship foster care provider under \u00a7 52-2-662, MCA, and Rule 37.51.202, Admin. R. M. A month later, DPHHS placed the child with her great aunt.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-11\">\u00b66 Despite the general prohibition of state interference with tribal affairs, DPHHS, a state agency, placed M.S., an Indian child, with Hanna, an enrolled member living on the Fort Peck Indian Reservation, under the auspices of a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between the Assiniboine and Sioux Tribes of the Fort Peck <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>Indian Reservation (Tribes), the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), and the State (DPHHS). The MOA, it turns out, is the linchpin of CFSD\u2019s claim for jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">\u00b67 M.S.\u2019s placement with Hanna was short-lived. In March 2005 staff at the daycare where Hanna would leave M.S. when she went to work reported their suspicion that M.S. was suffering abuse. Upon receiving the report of abuse, CFSD took physical custody of M.S., placing the child in a temporary foster home off the reservation, in Miles City. Subsequently M.S. was sent to Minnesota, which state retained legal custody. Minnesota later consented to M.S.\u2019s adoption.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">\u00b68 Contemporaneous with M.S.\u2019s removal, CFSD, along with BIA and a tribal criminal investigator, initiated an investigation into the cause of the alleged abuse. They concluded that Hanna had abused M.S., and in May 2005 CFSD issued a substantiated report of abuse and neglect to Hanna. The report informed Hanna of the adverse effects that CFSD\u2019s substantiation determination would have on her ability to obtain work in fields regulated by DPHHS.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">\u00b69 Within one month of receiving the substantiated report, Hanna sought a fair hearing under Rule 37.47.610, Admin. R. M., to contest the determination. Under Rule 37.47.615, Admin. R. M. (which contains exceptions to the right to a fair hearing under Rule 37.47.610, Admin. R. M.), a person subject to a substantiated report of child abuse is not entitled to a fair hearing if she has been convicted of an offense related to child abuse. CFSD did not begin the fair hearing process for Hanna until 2007, since the investigation had not led to criminal charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">\u00b610 After CFSD initiated the procedures for the fair hearing, Hanna moved to dismiss the substantiation proceeding on jurisdictional grounds. Hanna argued that under the Fort Peck Comprehensive Code of Justice (CCOJ), the Tribes maintained exclusive jurisdiction over matters involving Indian youth and that CFSD\u2019s substantiation proceeding interfered with tribal sovereignty. The hearing officer of DPHHS adopted this argument and dismissed the substantiation proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">\u00b611 CFSD appealed the hearing officer\u2019s decision to the District Court pursuant to the Montana Administrative Procedure Act (MAPA), \u00a7 2-4-702(l)(a), MCA. There, CFSD argued that pursuant to the MOA, it had jurisdiction to issue the substantiated report against Hanna under state law and policy because it had licensed Hanna as a kinship foster care provider in the first place. CFSD maintained that the CCOJ did not apply because its relevant provisions merely focused on the welfare of children and did not address substantiation determinations, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>focus on the abuser (here, Hanna). This argument persuaded the District Court, which reversed the hearing officer\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">\u00b612 Hanna timely appealed the District Court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">\u00b613 Resolution of this case turns on the question of subject matter jurisdiction. This is a question of law, which we review de novo. <em>See Bugger v. McGough, </em>2006 MT 248, \u00b6 19, 334 Mont. 77, 144 P.3d 802.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">\u00b614 <em>Whether the District Court erred in concluding that CFSD had jurisdiction to substantiate child abuse and neglect by Hanna.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b265-9\">\u00b615 Hanna\u2019s principal argument is that CFSD lacks jurisdiction to pursue a substantiation proceeding against an enrolled tribal member, like Hanna, for acts committed on the reservation against an Indian child. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-10\">\u00b616 Our discussion begins with the sovereign rights of the Fort Peck Indian Tribes. Tribes, as \u201cdomestic dependent nations,\u201d exercise \u201cinherent sovereign authority over their members and territories\u201d; that is, tribes may make laws to govern their internal affairs and social relations. <em>Zempel v. </em>Liberty, 2006 MT 220, \u00b6 20, 333 Mont. 417, 143 P.3d 123 (quoting <em>Okla. Tax Commn. v. Potawatomi Tribe, </em>498 U.S. 505, 509, 111 S. Ct. 905, 909 (1991)). Tribes are, however, subject to the \u201cplenary and exclusive\u201d authority of the United States Congress. <em>United States v. Lara, </em>541 U.S. 193, 200, 124 S. Ct. 1628, 1633 (2004). With roots in the so-called Indian Commerce Clause and the Treaty Clause, U.S. Const., art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 3; art. II, \u00a7 2, cl. 2, this congressional authority, along with tribes\u2019 recognized right of self-government, has traditionally operated to exclude state authority, or jurisdiction, over Indian affairs. <em>Lara, </em>541 U.S. at 200, 124 S. Ct. at 1633; <em>White Mt. Apache Tribe v. Bracker, </em>448 U.S. 136, 142, 100 S. Ct. 2578, 2583 (1980); <em>Worcester v. Georgia, </em>31 U.S. 515, 561 (1832); <em>but see Nevada v. Hicks, </em>533 U.S. 353, 361-62 n. 4, 121 S. Ct. 2304, 2311 n. 4 (2001) (suggesting, in dicta, limitation on holding from <em>Worcester).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b265-11\">\u00b617 This Court has acknowledged this general limitation, that \u201c[t]he exercise of state jurisdiction over activities occurring entirely on Indian lands is an infringement on inherent tribal authority and is contrary to principles of self-government and tribal sovereignty.\u201d <em>Flat Ctr. Farms, Inc. v. State, </em>2002 MT 140, \u00b6 13, 310 Mont. 206, 49 P.3d 578; <em>cf. First v. State, </em>247 Mont. 465, 471, 808 P.2d 467, 470 (1991) (ruling that State may exercise jurisdiction over tribal members within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>reservations if such exercise is not preempted by Congress and does not interfere with tribal sovereignty). Despite this general prohibition against state jurisdiction over Indian affairs, states and tribes may, with congressional approval, enter into cooperative agreements altering the scope of jurisdiction on reservations. <em>See Native Village of Stevens v. Smith, </em>770 F.2d 1486, 1489 (9th Cir. 1985) (explaining that 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1919(a) authorizes tribal-state cooperative agreements regarding child care); <em>cf. Kinnerly v. Dist. Ct. of the Ninth Jud. Dist. of Mont., </em>400 U.S. 423, 423-30, 91 S. Ct. 480, 480-84 (1971) (ruling that tribe could not grant state jurisdiction over tribal affairs absent congressional authorization).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">\u00b618 Here, CFSD points to the Memorandum of Agreement between the Tribes and DPHHS (and BIA) as the federally-authorized cooperative agreement that is the basis for its jurisdiction to maintain the substantiation determination. To evaluate this position, we must consider first whether the MOA enjoys congressional authorization, and second whether the MOA allows CFSD to pursue a substantiation proceeding against Hanna.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">\u00b619  The purpose of the MOA is to allow eligible Indian children on the Fort Peck Indian Reservation to receive services and foster care maintenance payments from CFSD (or BIA). Under the MOA, CFSD was to provide care and services to Indian children eligible for funding under the foster care program of Title IV-E of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 670-679c (2006).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Tribes, CFSD, and BIA entered into the MOA under the authority of the Indian Child Welfare Act, 25 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1901-1963 (2006). Under \u00a7 1919(a) of ICWA, tribes and states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-6\">are authorized to enter into agreements with each other respecting care and custody of Indian children and jurisdiction over child custody proceedings, including agreements which may provide for orderly transfer of jurisdiction on a case-by-case basis and agreements which provide for concurrent jurisdiction between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>States and Indian tribes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">This language is sufficiently broad to include agreements between tribes and states that grant state agencies jurisdiction to administer Title IV-E foster care programs and to make foster care maintenance payments to Indian children on Indian reservations. <em>See Native Village of Stevens, </em>770 F.2d at 1489-90 (holding that \u00a7 1919(a) does not require states to enter agreements with tribes, but suggesting that \u00a7 1919(a) allows tribes and states to enter agreements regarding Title IV-E foster care programs and payments). Accordingly, we conclude that the MOA is a valid, federally-authorized agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">\u00b620 Hanna objects to this conclusion, arguing that while \u00a7 1919(a) may authorize states and tribes to enter agreements \u201crespecting care and custody of Indian children and jurisdiction over child custody proceedings,\u201d it does not allow agreements that deprive tribal courts of jurisdiction to adjudicate the rights of accused abusers. We reject this argument. The substantiation proceeding, which is an adjudication of Hanna\u2019s rights, <em>Dowell v. Mont. Dept. of Pub. Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>2006 MT 55, \u00b6\u00b6 15-16, 20, 331 Mont. 305, 132 P.3d 520, arose directly from Hanna\u2019s \u201ccare\u201d of an Indian child, M.S. As such, it fits within the language of \u00a7 1919(a). Such investigation and verification of alleged child abuse and neglect are necessary components of an effective foster care program. <em>See e.g. </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 671(a)(9)-(10) (requiring approved state foster care programs to provide for reporting of child abuse and to establish standards for foster homes). Furthermore, as we see below, CFSD\u2019s authority to pursue the substantiation proceeding conforms with the grant of jurisdiction from the MOA.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">\u00b621 Accordingly, we turn to the second consideration: whether the MOA authorizes CFSD to pursue a substantiation proceeding against Hanna for her alleged abuse of M.S. We conclude that it does.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">\u00b622 The relevant language of the MOA is plain on its face. Part X of the MOA addresses licensing of foster homes. Paragraph B of Part X reads, \u201cThe Tribes and BIA will recognize the CFSD license of a foster home when the home has a current license issued by CFSD.\u201d Paragraph C of Part X then provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-8\">The agency that licensed a home, upon receipt of a referral regarding violation of foster home licensing standards, will conduct an investigation to determine compliance with governing licensing standards, statute/tribal code and policy. The final decision concerning licensing status will remain with the agency that issued the license.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b267-9\">Paragraph E of Part X adds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>When CFSD and BIA receive a referral on a licensed foster home alleging child abuse or neglect, the report shall be investigated by the placing agency and the agency that issued the license and follow the requirements of the Indian Child Protection Act (25 USC 3203) where appropriate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">\u00b623  These provisions demonstrate that DPHHS, the agency that licensed Hanna here, is responsible for investigating allegations of abuse and neglect, documenting the conclusions of such investigation in a final report, and making the final decision about Hanna\u2019s licensing status. By the terms of Paragraph E, upon receipt of an allegation of abuse and neglect by Hanna, CFSD (the relevant section of DPHHS) was required to conduct an investigation. Under 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 3203(b)-(c) of the Indian Child Protection Act (cited in Paragraph E), this investigation was to lead to a final written report (here, the substantiated report). Following the final written report, under Paragraph C, CFSD was required to make a final decision about Hanna\u2019s licensing status. Where the parties to the MOA wanted the Tribes\u2019 Comprehensive Code of Justice to apply or the Fort Peck Tribal Court to have jurisdiction, they expressly so stated. <em>See </em>MOA, pt. Ill, \u00b6 G; pt. V, \u00b6 B. The MOA does not contemplate tribal jurisdiction with regard to investigations of and reports on child abuse and neglect, and final licensing decisions brought by state agencies under Part X. For this reason, we hold that the CFSD had jurisdiction under the terms of the MOA to pursue the present substantiation proceeding against Hanna under state laws and regulations. We therefore affirm the ruling of the District Court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b268-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES NELSON, WHEAT and COTTER concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b266-7\"> Title IV-E creates a foster care program of \u201ccooperative federalism\u201d in which states may choose to participate. <em>Native Village of Stevens, </em>770 F.2d at 1487-88.
