Feltz and Green got into an argument outside of Feltz\u2019s trailer during which Feltz and Green were shoving, punching and kicking each other. Several witnesses also saw Feltz throw three unopened beer cans at Green. One of Feltz\u2019s neighbors, Ramona Champagne, attempted to break up the fight, but in the melee, Feltz hit her in the head. Another neighbor, Zona McConnell, tried to pull Feltz off of Champagne while Champagne\u2019s daughter, Jo\u00f1a Bear, hit and kicked Feltz. Champagne later received two stitches for a cut over her eyebrow.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">\u00b64 Justin Doney, also a resident of the trailer court, testified at trial that he witnessed three women beating on Feltz. Doney stated that Green was choking Feltz while he was on the ground and that Green did not let go until Feltz was almost unconscious. Doney further stated that he broke up the fight by pulling the women off of Feltz. Doney also testified that he saw Feltz grab a camouflage-handled knife out of his car and heard Feltz threaten to stab the people in the area. Doney later saw Feltz throw the knife in his car.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-8\">\u00b65 McConnell testified that she saw Feltz go over to his car, grab a knife out of it and head towards her and the others with the \u201cblade out towards people.\u201d She also described it as a green camouflage knife. McConnell further testified that Feltz was swearing at them and calling them names, and that she was scared. McConnell said she called 911 and then threw her cell phone at Feltz and ran away.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-9\">\u00b66 Another neighbor, Wayne Hewitt, testified that Feltz was on the ground \u201cand there was a whole bunch of ladies kicking him, beating him and stuff,\u201d and that Feltz was \u201c[flighting for his life.\u201d Hewitt stated that after the parties separated, Feltz went to his car and attempted to drive away, but he hit a fence. Hewitt testified that he never saw a knife. Champagne and Bear also testified that they did not see Feltz with a knife.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-10\">\u00b67 Phillip Pipestem witnessed the altercation while he was waiting for a ride to a softball game. Pipestem testified that when Feltz <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>approached him with the camouflage-handled knife, Pipestem threatened to beat Feltz with one of the baseball bats that Pipestem was carrying. Pipestem also testified that Feltz did not attempt to stab or cut anyone with the knife, and that, eventually, Feltz threw the camouflage knife in his car and pulled out a smaller knife.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">\u00b68 Kenneth Erickson, the owner of the trailer court, testified that Doney called him and told him that he needed to get over there because they were \u201ckilling each other.\u201d Erickson and his cousin, Travis Burchard, jumped in their truck and headed to the scene. Erickson stated that when he arrived, Feltz \u201clooked like he had the shit just kicked out of him.\u201d Erickson testified that he saw Feltz grab a little black pocket knife and \u201cbarely\u201d show it to the other people present. Erickson asked Feltz to give him the knife, and Feltz dropped it in his truck. Burchard testified that he also saw Feltz pull out a black pocket knife. He stated that Feltz just held the knife at his side; he did not waive it around or try to cut anyone.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">\u00b69 Feltz testified in his own defense, stating that he had an argument with Green that turned physical when she threw a pop can at him. Although he admitted hitting and shoving Green, he described her as the aggressor. Feltz testified that he was trying to leave when he was jumped by Green, and that is when McConnell, Champagne, and Bear began beating him. Feltz claimed that he did become unconscious when Green choked him and that he awoke on the ground with the four women kicking and hitting him. Feltz admitted hitting Champagne in order to get her off of him. He claimed that he pulled out the pocket knife to get the women to back away from him and that he did not attempt to stab or cut them. He also explained that at one point he went to his car to get away, but after he drove into a fence, he decided he was too intoxicated to drive. Feltz also claimed that while he was still in his car, Green was smacking him through the driver\u2019s side window.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">\u00b610 After the altercation, the police retrieved the small black folding pocket knife, but they did not find the camouflage-handled knife. Feltz was taken to the hospital in an ambulance. He suffered an abrasion, a scratch, and a small laceration, but did not have any severe injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"AEb\">\u00b611 On June 18, 2008, Feltz was charged by Information with one count of felony assault with a weapon for allegedly causing bodily injury to Green by hitting her with a beer can, and one count of misdemeanor assault for hitting Champagne. On July 2, 2008, the State added a second charge of assault with a weapon for causing McConnell \u201creasonable apprehension of bodily injury\u201d by threatening <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>her with a knife.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">\u00b612 A jury trial was held on January 14 and 15, 2009. During the settling of the jury instructions, the District Court allowed the State to amend the charge involving McConnell to allege that Feltz caused her a reasonable apprehension of <em>serious </em>bodily injury rather than merely bodily injury. In addition, with respect to the charge involving Green, the court instructed the jury on the lesser included offense of partner or family member assault, a misdemeanor. Feltz requested that the court also instruct the jury on the lesser included offense of misdemeanor assault with respect to the assault-with-a-weapon count involving McConnell, but the court refused to do so. The District Court did instruct the jury on the affirmative defense of justifiable use of force.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">\u00b613 The jury returned a verdict of guilty on the charges of partner and family member assault, misdemeanor assault, and felony assault with a weapon. On the felony charge, the District Court designated Feltz a persistent felony offender and committed him to the Montana State Prison for ten years with five years suspended. The court imposed six month sentences on each of the misdemeanor offenses to run concurrent to Feltz\u2019s sentence on the felony offense. Feltz appeals his conviction arguing that the District Court erred in instructing the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">\u00b614 The standard of review of a trial court\u2019s refusal to give an instruction on a lesser included offense is whether the trial court abused its discretion. <em>State v. Johnson, </em>2008 MT 227, \u00b6 12, 344 Mont. 313, 187 P.3d 662 (citing <em>State v. Flores, </em>1998 MT 328, \u00b6 40, 292 Mont. 255, 974 P.2d 124). District courts have broad discretion in formulating jury instructions; however, that discretion is ultimately restricted by the overriding principle that the jury instructions, taken as a whole, must fully and fairly instruct the jury regarding the applicable law. <em>State v. Azure, </em>2008 MT 211, \u00b6 13, 344 Mont. 188, 186 P.3d 1269 (citing <em>State v. Miller, </em>2008 MT 106, \u00b6 11, 342 Mont. 355, 181 P.3d 625).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b337-9\">\u00b615 <em>Did the District Court err when it denied Feltz\u2019s request to instruct the jury on misdemeanor assault as a lesser included offense of felony assault with a weapon?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b337-10\">\u00b616 During the settling of the jury instructions, Feltz\u2019s counsel requested that the District Court instruct the jury that misdemeanor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>assault was a lesser included offense of felony assault with a weapon for the count involving McConnell. Counsel argued that the case came down to whether McConnell feared <em>serious </em>bodily injury or merely bodily injury, thus a lesser included offense instruction was appropriate. The District Court rejected Feltz\u2019s proposed jury instruction on misdemeanor assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">\u00b617 An instruction on a lesser included offense \u201cmust be given when there is a proper request by one of the parties, and the jury, based on the evidence, could be warranted in finding the defendant guilty of a lesser included offense,\u201d rather than the greater offense. Section 46-16-607(2), MCA; <em>see also State v. Martinosky, </em>1999 MT 122, \u00b6 18, 294 Mont. 427, 982 P.2d 440. Moreover, a defendant is entitled to a lesser included offense instruction if two criteria are met: (1) the offense must constitute a lesser included offense as defined by \u00a7 46-1-202(9), MCA, and (2) there must be sufficient evidence to support an instruction on the lesser included offense. <em>State v. Cameron, </em>2005 MT 32, \u00b6 20, 326 Mont. 51, 106 P.3d 1189.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-5\">The purpose of this rule is to ensure reliability in the fact-finding process. It avoids the situation where the jury, convinced that the defendant is guilty of some crime, although not necessarily the crime charged, convicts the defendant rather than let his action go unpunished simply because the only alternative was acquittal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AQ5\"><em>State v. Castle, </em>285 Mont. 363, 367, 948 P.2d 688, 690 (1997) (citing <em>State v. Gopher, </em>194 Mont. 227, 230, 633 P.2d 1195, 1197-98 (1981)). \u00b618 An included offense is one that \u201cis established by proof of the same or less than all the facts required to establish the commission of the offense charged.\u201d Section 46-l-202(9)(a), MCA. \u201cFacts\u201d in this instance \u201crefers to the statutory elements of the offenses, not the individual facts of the case.\u201d <em>State v. Matt, </em>2005 MT 9, \u00b6 13, 325 Mont. 340, 106 P.3d 530 (quoting <em>State v. Beavers, </em>1999 MT 260, \u00b6 30, 296 Mont. 340, 987 P.2d 371).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">\u00b619 Tobe convicted of misdemeanor assault, a person must \u201cpurposely or knowingly\u201d cause a \u201creasonable apprehension of bodily injury in another.\u201d Section 45-5-201(l)(d), MCA. To be convicted of felony assault with a weapon, a person must \u201cpurposely or knowingly\u201d cause a \u201creasonable apprehension of <em>serious </em>bodily injury in another <em>by use of a weapon </em>or what reasonably appears to be a weapon.\u201d Section 45-5-213(l)(b), MCA (emphasis added). In addition, \u201cbodily injury\u201d means \u201cphysical pain, illness, or an impairment of physical condition . . . .\u201d Section 45-2-101(5), MCA. \u201cSerious bodily injury,\u201d on the other hand, means bodily injury that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>(i) creates a substantial risk of death;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-4\">(ii) causes serious permanent disfigurement or protracted loss or impairment of the function or process of a bodily member or organ; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-5\">(iii) at the time of injury, can reasonably be expected to result in serious permanent disfigurement or protracted loss or impairment of the function or process of a bodily member or organ.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">Section 45-2-101(66)(a), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">\u00b620 Thus felony assault with a weapon differs from misdemeanor assault only in the degree of the injury that is feared and the use of a weapon. There are no additional elements that must be proven in order to obtain a conviction for misdemeanor assault that are not included in the offense of felony assault with a weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">\u00b621 While the State concedes that misdemeanor assault qualifies as a lesser included offense of assault with a weapon, it argues that the District Court correctly denied the request for a lesser included offense instruction in this case because the evidence did not support it. Relying on this Court\u2019s decision in <em>State v. Reiner, </em>179 Mont. 239, 587 P.2d 950 (1978), the State contends that an instruction on the lesser included offense of misdemeanor assault need not be given where the evidence indicates that the only type of injury that would be feared was serious bodily injury. <em>Reiner, </em>however, is distinguishable from the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-9\">\u00b622 <em>InReiner, </em>the defendant, armed with a .357 Magnum revolver, not only threatened to kill the three individuals he thought were trespassing on the property he was caretaking, he fired two shots at the ground near where they were standing. On that basis, the defendant was charged with three counts of aggravated assault pursuant to \u00a7 94-5-202(l)(c), RCM (1947).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Reiner, </em>179 Mont. at 241-43, 587 P.2d 15 952-53. During trial, the defendant offered an instruction on the lesser included offense of assault, but the trial court refused his offered instruction and provided the jury with verdict forms that permitted a finding of either aggravated assault or not guilty. <em>Reiner, </em>179 Mont. at 251, 587 P.2d at 957.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-10\">\u00b623 We stated in <em>Reiner </em>that \u201cthe question of whether a bodily injury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>is \u2018serious\u2019 within the meaning of the criminal code definition is one of fact to be considered and determined by the jury.\u201d <em>Reiner, </em>179 Mont. at 252, 587 P.2d at 958 (citing <em>State v. Fuger, 170 </em>Mont. 442, 445, 554 P.2d 1338, 1340 (1976)). However, we rejected the defendant\u2019s claim in <em>Reiner </em>that he was entitled to an instruction on the lesser included offense of assault because it was \u201cclear that defendant put his victims in reasonable apprehension of <em>serious </em>bodily injury by <em>his menacing use of a .357 Magnum revolver.\u201d Reiner, </em>179 Mont. at 253, 587 P.2d at 958 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">\u00b624 Unlike <em>Reiner </em>where the defendant fired two shots near his victims and threatened to kill them, there was evidence that Feltz did not hold the knife in a \u201cmenacing\u201d manner, nor did he try to stab or cut anyone with it. Also, the difference in the type of weapon used in each case is significant. Faced with a .357 Magnum revolver that the defendant had already fired twice, the victims in <em>Reiner </em>clearly had a reasonable apprehension of <em>serious </em>bodily injury. Whereas, in the instant case, depending on the fact-finders belief of the evidence presented regarding the type and size of knife used and the manner in which Feltz was holding that knife, a jury could conclude that McConnell only had a reasonable apprehension of bodily injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">\u00b625 Nevertheless, the State contends that \u201ca person who fears being injured with a knife would, at a minimum, apprehend \u2018serious permanent disfigurement,\u2019 and would likely apprehend, \u2018loss or impairment of the function or process of a bodily member or organ\u2019 and death.\u201d Not so as the type of injury apprehended would depend on the size and type of knife used and the manner in which the knife was being held. As noted earlier in this Opinion, \u201cthe question of whether a bodily injury is \u2018serious\u2019 within the meaning of the criminal code definition is one of fact to be considered and determined by the jury.\u201d <em>Reiner, </em>179 Mont. at 252, 587 P.2d at 958.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">\u00b626 In this case, the court took the elements of <em>reasonable </em>apprehension and <em>serious </em>bodily injury out of the hands of the jury. In addition, in denying Feltz\u2019s request for a lesser included offense instruction, the judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-7\">It\u2019s my thought, there\u2019s a charge of assault by putting Zona McConnell in reasonable apprehension of serious bodily injury by a weapon. She said she received no injury. She was only in fear because of the weapon. So the jury would decide if there was a weapon, and if there was a weapon <em>she was in reasonable apprehension of fear. </em>If they don\u2019t, not guilty. I don\u2019t see any evidence that assault would be a lessor [sic] offense, because there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>is no evidence of that. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">However, the fact that McConnell was afraid is not the question here. The question is whether she was afraid of bodily injury or serious bodily injury. There was no evidence presented here that McConnell feared for her life. While she testified that she was scared, she did not testify that she feared permanent disfigurement or death.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">\u00b627 Furthermore, the State\u2019s theory is inconsistent. On one hand the State concedes that assault is a lesser included offense of assault with a weapon and, on the other hand, the State maintains that if a weapon is used, assault cannot be a lesser included offense because the bodily injury feared would always be serious. Under this theory, the facts encompassing the event where the weapon was used would be irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">\u00b628  We conclude that there was evidence in the record to support a misdemeanor assault instruction in this case. Although Feltz admitted pulling a knife in self defense, the size and type of knife used, the way he held it, whether he displayed it prominently, and what he said while doing so were in dispute. The jury could have believed Feltz pulled out a small pocket knife, held it at his side with the blade down, and did not make threatening statements while doing so. Neither McConnell nor anyone else testified that Feltz told McConnell he would kill her or that he was going to cut or stab her. And McConnell did not testify that she feared for her life. In addition, neither of the other women with her, whom McConnell claimed were likewise threatened by Feltz, reported seeing a knife or hearing anything about a knife. They also did not report being threatened by Feltz.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">\u00b629  Based on this testimony, we agree with Feltz that a rational jury could have concluded that McConnell was not actually in fear of serious bodily injury, or that such fear was not reasonable in light of the circumstances. Accordingly, we hold that the District Court erred in denying Feltz\u2019s request to instruct the jury on misdemeanor assault as a lesser included offense of assault with a weapon, and we reverse and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<judges id=\"b341-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES WHEAT, LEAPHART, COTTER, MORRIS and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b339-11\"> The offense of aggravated assault was the precursor to the offense of assault with a weapon.
