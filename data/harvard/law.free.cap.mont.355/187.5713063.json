Passmore appeals from his convictions of one count of sexual intercourse without consent and three counts of sexual assault following a jury trial in the Sixth Judicial District Court, Park County. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-9\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b214-10\">\u00b62 Passmore raises four issues on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-11\">1. Did the District Court err in denying Passmore\u2019s motion to dismiss the prosecution on the grounds of preaccusation delay?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-12\">2. Did the District Court err in denying Passmore\u2019s motion to dismiss the prosecution on the grounds of prosecutorial misconduct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-13\">3. Did the District Court abuse its discretion in disallowing extrinsic evidence of prior statements allegedly made by one of the victims?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>4. Did the District Court abuse its discretion in excluding testimony from a defense witness that Passmore lacked the character traits of a sex offender?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">\u00b63 Passmore and his wife moved to Livingston, Montana, in March 1997 after he was offered the pastorship of the Livingston Church of God. The two victims in the present case, whom we refer to as C.R. and J.R., and their parents, Edwin and D\u2019Dea, joined Passmore\u2019s congregation the following year. At the time, C.R. was 11 years old (she turned 12 in July 1998) and J.R. was 13 years old (she turned 14 in November 1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">\u00b64 The events underlying the charged offenses occurred in the summer and fall of 1998. During this period, C.R. routinely helped out at the church with various chores, such as cleaning, vacuuming, painting, spraying weeds, and picking up rocks in the yard. J.R. also helped out with chores, though not as often. On occasions when they were both at the church, C.R. and J.R. typically worked separately on different projects.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">\u00b65 C.R. and J.R. both testified at Passmore\u2019s trial about interactions and contacts he had with them of a sexual nature. For example, J.R. testified that one day while she was taking laundry up to Passmore\u2019s bedroom in the parsonage, Passmore followed her there and asked whether she had started her menstrual cycle yet, whether she was having sex with boys, and whether she had been tickled all over. Passmore lay down on the bed and asked J.R. to lie beside him so he could tickle her. J.R. felt this would be inappropriate; so, she made up an excuse and left the room.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-8\">\u00b66 Similarly, C.R. testified that one day while she was vacuuming the sanctuary, Passmore came in and asked her to sit down because he wanted to ask her a question. She did so, and Passmore then asked whether she had started her menstrual cycle. C.R. replied, \u201cNo.\u201d He also asked whether J.R. had started her menstrual cycle, and C.R. said she did not know. Passmore then pulled C.R. closer and started tickling her. C.R. squirmed, and they ended up on the floor, at which point Passmore put C.R.\u2019s hands over her head and held them there with one hand while he tickled her with his other hand. He then moved his hand up her leg, under her shorts, and started rubbing her genitalia. He commented that her underwear was his favorite color. He then moved the underwear aside and digitally penetrated her vagina. C.R. testified that \u201cI was trying to fight him, and eventually I just kind <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>of calmed down and said, I think I need to go back to vacuuming, now. And he got up and went back into his office.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">\u00b67 Shortly thereafter, C.R. was in the nursery picking up toys and preparing to vacuum when Passmore came in and started tickling her again. She testified that \u201cwe wound up, again, on the floor where we kind of... wrestled back and forth. I remember him being on top of me, and then somehow in our moving around, it got to where we were facing each other, but I was positioned more on his lap, and he was holding me there.\u201d At this point, Edna Miller (a member of the congregation) entered the room. She saw Passmore and C.R. sitting on the floor facing each other. Passmore had his legs straight out and C.R. was straddling his knees. Miller further observed that Passmore was holding C.R.\u2019s arms and rocking her back and forth. After roughly 30 seconds, they noticed Miller standing there. According to Miller, C.R. jumped up and stated, \u201cHe\u2019s teasing me.\u201d Passmore, who was \u201ckind of red-faced,\u201d also jumped up and left the nursery, telling Miller he needed to show her a document in his office.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">\u00b68 C.R. testified about several other incidents. One took place in a shed Passmore was building near the parsonage. C.R. was working on a project there when Passmore started tickling her and his hand went up her shirt to her chest. In another instance, also in the shed, Passmore fondled C.R.\u2019s breasts and tried to do the same with her genitalia. Regarding this tickling and fondling, C.R. explained that she \u201cthought it was kind of a weird situation, but he was the pastor, so I didn\u2019t question it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">\u00b69 Another incident occurred in Passmore\u2019s truck while he and C.R. were going to get some dirt to fill in holes in the parsonage yard. Passmore placed one hand on C.R.\u2019s thigh while he was driving and rubbed her inner thigh near her crotch. On still another occasion, C.R. accidentally got paint on her shorts while painting some trim on the shed. Passmore suggested it would be a good idea to wash them right away to get the paint out. So, they put the shorts in the laundry machine and C.R., in the meantime, wore a pair of windbreaker pants she had with her. Later, while waiting for the shorts to dry, C.R. and Passmore sat on a couch in the parsonage and watched some home videos. At some point, Passmore asked C.R. to sit on his lap. She complied, but sat perpendicularly to his legs. Passmore, however, turned her so that she was facing him, with her buttocks on his knees. C.R. testified that the following then occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-7\">We sat there for a minute, and he had his hands on my stomach and abdomen, where he lifted my shirt up. He commented on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>fact that my bra was more fancy and lacey. He continued up, and one hand went over the top of my bra, with the lace, and the other one went underneath, \u2018cause it was stretchy, and he, I guess you would call it manipulated my breasts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-4\">C.R. stated that Passmore fondled her breasts for about five minutes until C.R. told him that she could see his wife coming down the road in their Subaru.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">\u00b610 In July 1998, the church youth group took a trip to the Big Timber Waterslide Park. Passmore and several parents chaperoned the event. J.R. testified that Passmore went down the slides with her and, with J.R. sitting in front of him, \u201che would grab me over my chest and lay me back against him to go through the tunnels,\u201d with his inner forearms on J.R.\u2019s breasts. J.R. felt uncomfortable with this but assumed it was accidental because \u201cI didn\u2019t think that my pastor would purposefully touch me like that.\u201d C.R. testified that Passmore rode down the slide with her as well and that as they leaned back to go through the tunnels, his hands moved from her waist up to her breasts.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">\u00b611 The youth group also took a trip to Chico Hot Springs in December 1998. C.R. testified that Passmore was in the pool with her and the other kids and that he attempted to put his hand inside her swimsuit. C.R. swam away and hid behind some male friends. J.R. testified that Passmore actually tickled her and, at one point, put one arm around her midsection and pinched her butt three times with his other hand. J.R. elbowed Passmore in the face and took a swing at him with her right hand in order to get away.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">\u00b612 On the way home from Chico, Edwin asked J.R. why she had taken a swing at Passmore in the pool. J.R. told him it was because Passmore would not stop pinching her butt. The next morning, C.R. told D\u2019Dea that Passmore had touched her inappropriately as well and that this had been going on since the summer. In light of these revelations, Edwin and D\u2019Dea filed a complaint with church officials (on behalf of C.R. and J.R.) and attempted to resolve the matter within the confines of the church. As D\u2019Dea explained at trial, \u201cpart of the doctrine was that we were to settle things within and not go to the outside. So, we tried. We did everything that we could feasibly do, through the church, itself, to rectify the situation.\u201d They did not report the incidents to law enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-8\">\u00b613 A church \u201cTrial Board\u201d reviewed Edwin and D\u2019Dea\u2019s complaint and concluded in December 1998 that the evidence against Passmore was \u201cinconclusive.\u201d Nevertheless, observing that \u201cthe appearance of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>\u2018borderline\u2019 conduct remains an issue,\u201d the board recommended that Passmore undergo counseling. Passmore, however, voluntarily left his position and moved out of state in January 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">\u00b614 Although Edwin felt that the matter had not been dealt with appropriately, he also felt that it was out of his hands. Then, in 2002, he did some plumbing work for a local attorney named Mark Hartwig. Upon learning that Hartwig was an attorney, Edwin described the incidents involving Passmore and the decision of the church board, and he conveyed some confusion about his and his daughters\u2019 rights. Hartwig advised Edwin to report the incidents. Thereafter, in the fall of 2002, Edwin contacted the County Attorney and also met with Michelle Morris, a detective with the Livingston Police Department. \u00b6 15 The State did not initially pursue the matter, however. Conflicting explanations for this were provided at trial. Morris stated that she did not open an investigation \u201cbecause I didn\u2019t have victims\u2019 testimony, statements, interviews.\u201d She testified that C.R. and J.R. \u201cwere not cooperative, at that time.\u201d J.R., in contrast, testified that she was with Edwin when he went to see Morris and that she told Morris during this meeting what had happened with Passmore. J.R. and Edwin both stated they were under the impression that Morris did not pursue the matter because too much time had passed since the incidents (i.e., the case had become stale). Morris, however, denied having said that it was too late to prosecute. Rather, she testified that she had told Edwin she needed victim statements due to the lack of physical evidence and eyewitnesses. Morris also stated that the only contact she had was with Edwin on that one date and that she had advised him he needed to convince his daughters to come in and speak with her. Yet, according to Morris, Edwin \u201cmade it clear that they were uncooperative, at the time.\u201d Morris said that to the best of her recollection, she never spoke with J.R.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">\u00b616 Edwin eventually retained Hartwig, who in April 2005 filed a civil suit against Passmore and the Church of God on behalf of C.R. and J.R. Ultimately, the civil claims against the church were settled in late 2006 for an undisclosed sum and, in conjunction with the settlement, the civil claims against Passmore were dismissed. In the meantime, Hartwig (at the behest of his clients) also made efforts to have criminal charges brought. Specifically, shortly after filing the civil complaint, Hartwig gave a copy of it to the Park County Attorney (Tara DePuy at the time) and suggested that she take a look at it since the conduct alleged in the complaint could merit a criminal investigation. Following a change of personnel in the Park County Attorney\u2019s Office, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>Hartwig gave a copy of the civil complaint to the new County Attorney (Brett Linneweber) in September or October of 2005. Linneweber indicated that he would look into the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">\u00b617 On November 14, 2005, Linneweber referred the case to Park County Detective Tony Steffins, who in turn proceeded with an investigation. Thereafter, Linneweber filed a criminal complaint against Passmore in Park County Justice Court on April 10,2006. The court issued an arrest warrant, which was served on Passmore in Virginia (where he was living at the time) on April 11. Linneweber then filed an information in District Court on May 31, 2006, alleging multiple counts of sexual assault and sexual intercourse without consent. In July 2007, the court granted a motion by the State to file an amended information, charging six counts of sexual assault, a felony, in violation of \u00a7 45-5-502, MCA (1997), and two counts of sexual intercourse without consent, a felony, in violation of \u00a7 45-5-503, MCA (1997). The charges were as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-5\">Count I (sexual assault): repeatedly touching C.R.\u2019s breasts and/or genitalia during the period of May 1, 1998, through December 9, 1998.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-6\">Count II (sexual intercourse without consent): digitally penetrating C.R.\u2019s vulva on or about July 1, 1998.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-8\">Count III (sexual assault): touching C.R.\u2019s breasts at the Big Timber Waterslide Park on or about July 15, 1998.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-9\">Count IV (sexual assault): touching J.R.\u2019s breasts at the Big Timber Waterslide Park on or about July 15, 1998.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-10\">Count V (sexual assault): grabbing or touching J.R.\u2019s buttocks in a pool at Chico Hot Springs on or about December 10, 1998. Counts VI, VII, and VIII: offenses involving another girl named A.M.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b219-11\">\u00b618 Meanwhile, Passmore filed two pretrial motions relating to Detective Steffins\u2019 investigative tactics. First, he moved to suppress statements he had made during an April 2006 interview with Steffins in Virginia. The District Court granted the motion, finding that under the totality of the circumstances, \u201cDetective Steffins crossed the boundary into coerciveness.\u201d The court also found that Steffins\u2019 \u201cguilt assumption technique\u201d was \u201cnot only coercive but unconscionable.\u201d Second, Passmore moved to dismiss the entire case on the grounds of \u201coutrageous governmental conduct.\u201d He asserted that Steffins had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>attempted to influence three witnesses\u2019 testimony and to deter them from testifying on behalf of the defense. He further asserted that Steffins had obtained exculpatory evidence in the course of his interviews but had failed to disclose this evidence to the defense. The District Court held an evidentiary hearing at which Passmore\u2019s claims were largely substantiated. For example, one of the witnesses testified that Steffins had told her: \u201cI\u2019ve done my job for many years, I know what a pedophile is, ... [and] Terry is a prime candidate for a pedophile.\u201d Similarly, another witness testified that Steffins had told him: \u201c[W]ithin the course of the years that I\u2019ve been doing this sort of thing, I can tell you that he is guilty.\u201d The District Court found that Steffins had in fact \u201cattempted to influence witnesses\u201d and that Steffins\u2019 conduct was \u201coutrageous and unacceptable\u201d-a finding that the prosecuting attorney effectively conceded at the conclusion of the hearing. The court also found that Steffins had obtained \u201cexonerating information\u201d during the interviews. However, the court noted that since the three witnesses had been listed as defense witnesses, Passmore could have interviewed them and obtained the exonerating information himself. Furthermore, the court observed that each of the witnesses had testified that Steffins did not actually succeed in influencing their testimony. Thus, the court denied Passmore\u2019s motion to dismiss because he had failed to show prejudice. But the court told him that he would have great latitude in questioning these witnesses about Steffins\u2019 behavior and credibility. The court also indicated that it would sanction Steffins in a separate proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">\u00b619 A seven-day jury trial commenced on November 26,2007. Twenty witnesses testified, including Passmore. He denied molesting C.R. in the shed, denied pinning C.R. down and putting his fingers in her vagina, denied asking J.R. to lie down on a bed with him, and denied asking C.R. or J.R. whether they had started their menstrual cycles. He admitted to having tickled C.R., but he claimed that he did not intend it to be sexual. Rather, he stated that C.R. used to jump on his back and that he would tickle her in order to dislodge her. He testified that he had no recollection of how C.R. ended up on his lap in the nursery the day Edna Miller observed them; however, he conceded that it \u201clooked very bad\u201d for him, a forty-year-old man, to be sitting on the floor of the nursery holding C.R.\u2019s arms and rocking her back and forth while she was straddling his legs, with her legs spread apart, wearing shorts. Passmore also admitted to riding down the waterslides with some of the kids in the youth group, but he said he never touched C.R.\u2019s or J.R.\u2019s breasts during those rides. In addition, he admitted to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>engaging in \u201chorseplay\u201d with 12 of the kids in the pool at Chico Hot Springs, but he did not remember making any physical contact with C.R. He also did not recall J.R. elbowing him or taking a swing at him, and he denied touching or pinching J.R.\u2019s butt.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">\u00b620 The jury ultimately acquitted Passmore of Count III (touching C.R.\u2019s breasts at the Big Timber waterslides) and Counts VI, VII, and VIII (the offenses involving A.M.). But the jury returned guilty verdicts on Counts I, II, TV, and V. The court designated Passmore a Level 1 sex offender, see \u00a7 46-23-509, MCA, and sentenced him to 35 years in the Montana State Prison, with 5 years suspended, for sexual intercourse without consent. The court further sentenced him to 10 years in prison, with 5 years suspended, on each of the three sexual-assault convictions. These sentences are to run concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">\u00b621 Additional facts are set forth below where relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">\u00b622 <em>Issue 1. Did the District Court err in denying Passmore\u2019s motion to dismiss the prosecution on the grounds of preaccusation delay?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">I. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b221-9\">\u00b623 The issue of preaccusation<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> delay presents a question of constitutional law. <em>See State v. DuBray, </em>2003 MT 255, \u00b6 28, 317 Mont. 377, 77 P.3d 247; <em>State v. Taylor, </em>1998 MT 121, \u00b6 18,289 Mont. 63, 960 P.2d 773. We review a trial court\u2019s resolution of such questions de novo to determine whether the court\u2019s interpretation and application of the law are correct. <em>See Taylor, </em>\u00b6 19; <em>State v. Ariegwe, </em>2007 MT 204, \u00b6 119, 338 Mont. 442, 167 P.3d 815; <em>State v. Spang, </em>2007 MT 54, \u00b6 7, 336 Mont. 184, 153 P.3d 646.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-10\">II. Passmore\u2019s Motion to Dismiss for Preaccusation Delay</p>\n<p id=\"b221-11\">\u00b624 On November 21, 2007, Passmore filed a motion to dismiss the case due to \u201cexcessive pre-indictment delay.\u201d He asserted that he had suffered \u201cextreme\u201d prejudice because the State\u2019s investigation of the charges was untimely and gave the complaining witnesses \u201cyears to hone their stories\u201d and also gave A.M. the opportunity \u201cto join in the accusations.\u201d He asserted that he \u201cwould not have spent years building <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>a successful career only to see it ruined\u201d and that his family \u201cwould have had the matter resolved, one way or another, a long time ago, versus what happened: adding a fourth child to their family (in 2004) and thinking that they could move on with their lives, then facing ruin.\u201d The District Court denied the motion on two grounds. First, the court viewed the motion as \u201coutside of the scheduling order\u201d and, thus, untimely. Second, the court observed that Passmore had argued only personal consequences resulting from the delay and had not shown prejudice in his ability to present a defense at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">III. Applicable Law</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">\u00b625 The Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and Article II, Section 24 of the Montana Constitution guarantee a criminal defendant the right to a speedy trial. This right applies once a defendant has been indicted, arrested, or otherwise officially accused. <em>SeeAriegwe, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 20, 42. It does not apply, however, to the period between crime and official accusation. <em>See Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 42; <em>United States v. MacDonald, </em>456 U.S. 1, 6-7, 102 S. Ct. 1497, 1501 (1982); <em>United States v. Marion, </em>404 U.S. 307, 313-15, 320-21, 92 S. Ct. 455, 459-60, 463-64 (1971). Rather, the law has provided other mechanisms to guard against long delay during the preaccusation period.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">\u00b626 One mechanism is the applicable statute of limitations. Indeed, this is the primary guarantee against bringing overly stale criminal charges. <em>Marion, </em>404 U.S. at 322, 92 S. Ct. at 464; <em>accord State v. Krinitt, </em>251 Mont. 28, 32-33, 823 P.2d 848, 851 (1991).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-7\">The purpose of a statute of limitations is to limit exposure to criminal prosecution to a certain fixed period of time following the occurrence of those acts the legislature has decided to punish by criminal sanctions. Such a limitation is designed to protect individuals from having to defend themselves against charges when the basic facts may have become obscured by the passage of time and to minimize the danger of official punishment because of acts in the far-distant past. Such a time limit may also have the salutary effect of encouraging law enforcement officials promptly to investigate suspected criminal activity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b222-8\"><em>Toussie v. United States, </em>397 U.S. 112, 114-15, 90 S. Ct. 858, 860 (1970). Statutes of limitations thus represent legislative assessments of relative interests of the state and the defendant in administering and receiving justice. <em>Marion, </em>404 U.S. at 322, 92 S. Ct. at 464. They are made for the repose of society and the protection of those who may, during the preaccusation period, have lost their means of defense. <em>Id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>They provide predictability by specifying a limit beyond which there is an irrebuttable presumption that a defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial would be prejudiced.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">\u00b627 The applicable statute of limitations, however, does not fully define a defendant\u2019s rights with respect to the events occurring prior to official accusation. <em>Id. </em>at 324, 92 S. Ct. at 465. The Supreme Court has recognized that \u201cthe Due Process Clause has a limited role to play in protecting against oppressive [preaccusation] delay.\u201d <em>United States v. Lovasco, </em>431 U.S. 783, 789, 97 S. Ct. 2044, 2048 (1977). Specifically, the Due Process Clause requires dismissal of the prosecution where compelling the defendant to stand trial (even though the statute of limitations has not yet run) would violate \u201cthose fundamental conceptions of justice which lie at the base of our civil and political institutions and which define the community\u2019s sense of fair play and decency.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 790, 97 S. Ct. at 2049 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). To determine whether such a violation has occurred, \u201cthe due process inquiry must consider the reasons for the delay as well as the prejudice to the accused.\u201d <em>Id. </em>And, unlike the right to a speedy trial, where no one factor in the analysis is either a necessary or a sufficient condition to the finding of a deprivation of the right, <em>see Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 101-102, \u201cproof of prejudice is generally a necessary but not sufficient element of a due process <em>claim,\u201d Lovasco, </em>431 U.S. at 790, 97 S. Ct. at 2048-49.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">\u00b628 Accordingly, in making a due process claim based on preaccusation delay, the defendant first must demonstrate that he or she has suffered actual, substantial prejudice resulting from the delay. <em>Krinitt, </em>251 Mont. at 34, 823 P.2d at 852 (citing <em>United States v. Valentine, </em>783 F.2d 1413, 1416-17 (9th Cir. 1986)). Prejudice in this context means \u201cthat sort of deprivation that impairs a defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial.\u201d <em>United States v. Cornielle, </em>171 F.3d 748, 752 (2d Cir. 1999). Such prejudice is commonly demonstrated by the loss of witnesses or physical evidence or the impairment of their use (e.g., dimming of a witness\u2019s memory). <em>See United States v. Mays, </em>549 F.2d 670, 677 (9th Cir. 1977); <em>Cornielle, </em>171 F.3d at 752; <em>see also e.g. State v. Taylor, </em>1998 MT 121, \u00b6\u00b6 22-27, 289 Mont. 63, 960 P.2d 773. It could also be demonstrated by the defendant\u2019s inability to assist in his own defense. <em>See United States v. Schaffer, </em>586 F.3d 414, 424-25 (6th Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>2009). But the defendant has a \u201cheavy burden\u201d to show that preaccusation delay caused actual prejudice. <em>United States v. Moran, </em>759 F.2d 777, 782 (9th Cir. 1985). The proof must be definite and not speculative or presumed. <em>See id.; Schaffer, </em>586 F.3d at 425; <em>see also United States v. Manning, </em>56 F.3d 1188, 1194 (9th Cir. 1995) (\u201cGeneralized assertions of the loss of memory, witnesses, or evidence are insufficient to establish actual prejudice.\u201d). And the defendant must demonstrate not only the loss of a witness or evidence, but also how that loss is prejudicial to his case, <em>Moran, </em>759 F.2d at 782; <em>Mays, </em>549 F.2d at 677, i.e., how the loss \u201cactually impaired his ability meaningfully to defend himself,\u201d <em>United States v. Pallan, </em>571 F.2d 497, 501 (9th Cir. 1978); <em>accord United States v. Corona-Verbera, </em>509 F.3d 1105, 1112 (9th Cir. 2007). <em>See also United States v. Canoy, </em>38 F.3d 893, 902 (7th Cir. 1994) (the defendant must present concrete evidence showing material harm).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">\u00b629 If the defendant makes a showing of actual, substantial prejudice from the delay, then the State must come forward and provide its reasons for the delay, <em>Canoy, </em>38 F.3d at 902, and the court must then weigh the State\u2019s justification for the delay against the defendant\u2019s prejudice and the absolute length of the delay to determine if due process would be (or has been) denied by compelling the defendant to stand trial, <em>see id.; Krinitt, </em>251 Mont. at 34-35, 823 P.2d at 852 (citing <em>Lovasco, </em>431 U.S. at 790, 97 S. Ct. at 2048-49, <em>Mays, </em>549 F.2d at 677-78, and <em>Moran, </em>759 F.2d at 780-83); <em>Taylor, </em>\u00b6 20. \u201cThe greater the length of the delay and the more substantial the actual prejudice to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>defendant becomes, the greater the reasonableness and the necessity for the delay will have to be to balance out the prejudice.\u201d <em>Mays, </em>549 F.2d at 678. But despite the degree of actual prejudice, there must be some culpability on the government\u2019s part before a dismissal may be granted. <em>Id. </em>For example, although the government has a good deal of leeway in its decisions as to the timing of arrests and filing charges, <em>see </em>id.; <em>Lovasco, </em>431 U.S. at 790-96, 97 S. Ct. at 2049-52, dismissal would be required if the State delayed the prosecution intentionally in order to gain a tactical advantage over the defendant and the defendant suffered substantial prejudice as a result, <em>see Marion, </em>404 U.S. at 324, 92 S. Ct. at 465. Likewise, delay is weighed heavily against the State if it was incurred in reckless disregard of circumstances indicating an appreciable risk that delay would impair the defendant\u2019s ability to mount an effective defense. <em>See Lovasco, </em>431 U.S. at 795 n. 17, 97 S. Ct. at 2051 n. 17. Finally, negligent conduct may be considered, though it is weighed less heavily than deliberate delays. <em>Mays, </em>549 F.2d at 678; <em>cf. State v. DuBray, </em>2003 MT 255, \u00b6 30, 317 Mont. 377, 77 P.3d 247 (the State must explain how periods of inactivity comport with a conscientious and reasonable investigation). \u201cIf mere negligent conduct by the prosecutors is asserted, then obviously the delay and/or prejudice suffered by the defendant will have to be greater than that in cases where recklessness or intentional governmental conduct is alleged.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Moran, </em>759 F.2d at 782.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\">IV. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">\u00b630 At the outset, the State argues that we should affirm the denial of Passmore\u2019s motion to dismiss on the ground that it was untimely. As noted, Passmore was charged in Justice Court on April 10, 2006; he was arrested the following day; the State filed the Information in District Court on May 31, 2006; and Passmore filed his motion to dismiss for preaccusation delay on November 21, 2007. The State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>argues that a claim based on preaccusation delay \u201cripens once the defendant has been formally accused, and therefore can and should be raised \u2018at the time set by the court\u2019 \u201d (quoting \u00a7 46-13-101(2), MCA). But here, the State contends, Passmore missed the court\u2019s deadlines for filing pretrial motions and thus forfeited his right to raise this issue. The State relies on <em>State v. VonBergen, </em>2003 MT 265, \u00b6 13, 317 Mont. 445, 77 P.3d 537, where we observed that this Court \u201cconsistently has affirmed a district court\u2019s denial of an untimely motion to suppress under both current and predecessor statutes setting time requirements for such motions\u201d (brackets and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">\u00b631 Yet, in the present case we are dealing with a motion to dismiss for preaccusation delay, not a motion to suppress, and we disagree with the State\u2019s premise that a claim of preaccusation delay always \u201cripens once the defendant has been formally accused.\u201d In some cases, actual prejudice to the defense resulting from such delay might not become evident until trial. Indeed, this point is implicit in <em>Marion, </em>where the Court observed that <em>\u201c/ejvents of the trial </em>may demonstrate actual prejudice, but at the present time appellees\u2019 due process claims are speculative and premature.\u201d 404 U.S. at 326, 92 S. Ct. at 466 (emphasis added); <em>see also United States v. MacDonald, </em>435 U.S. 850, 858, 98 S. Ct. 1547, 1552 (1978) (\u201cBefore trial, of course, an estimate of the degree to which delay has impaired an adequate defense tends to be speculative.\u201d); <em>United States v. Crouch, </em>84 F.3d 1497, 1516 (5th Cir. 1996) (en banc). Notably, the <em>Marion </em>appellees filed their motion to dismiss just two weeks after they were indicted, <em>see Marion, </em>404 U.S. at 308-09, 92 S. Ct. at 457, and yet the Supreme Court found those claims to be \u201cspeculative and premature.\u201d For these reasons, we reject the State\u2019s argument that a motion to dismiss for preaccusation delay cannot be raised after the deadlines set by the trial court for filing other pretrial motions. While such a motion could indeed be untimely under the particular facts of a given case, <em>see e.g. United States v. Gladney, </em>474 F.3d 1027, 1031 (8th Cir. 2007) (concluding that the defendant had failed to justify his waiting until just prior to closing arguments to raise the delay issue), we refuse to adopt the rigid rule advocated by the State here.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">\u00b632  That said, we agree with the State as to the merits of Passmore\u2019s claim. He asserts that he suffered \u201cextreme\u201d prejudice due to the preaccusation delay, and he argues essentially four examples of this. We conclude, however, that he has not met his heavy burden of showing \u201cactual, substantial prejudice\u201d with definite, nonspeculative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">\u00b633 First, Passmore maintains that no charges would have been filed at all if \u201cHartwig had not filed a multi-million dollar civil suit and made multiple attempts to have a criminal prosecution instituted,\u201d ultimately \u201cprevailing] with a prosecutor who assigned the case to an investigator who used unscrupulous techniques.\u201d This is all conjecture, however. There is no concrete evidence in the record that Linneweber would not have brought the charges but for the civil suit, Hartwig\u2019s efforts, and Steffins\u2019 \u201cunscrupulous\u201d techniques. For that matter, it seems that Passmore is complaining not about the delay in filing the charges, but about the fact that they were filed, allegedly at Hartwig\u2019s urging. Yet, Passmore has not explained how any of this demonstrates that he was prejudiced by the preaccusation delay. To the extent he is suggesting that the filing of charges is itself actual prejudice (a proposition for which he cites no authority), we disagree. If this implausible premise were accepted, every criminal defendant would satisfy the prejudice prong of the due process test simply by virtue of having been charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">\u00b634 Second, Passmore asserts that he was prejudiced by the State\u2019s failure to pursue an investigation into C.R.\u2019s and J.R.\u2019s allegations until November 2005, three years after Edwin brought the matter to the attention of the County Attorney and Detective Morris. He says this delay gave C.R. and J.R. \u201cyears to embellish and hone their stories.\u201d In particular, he contends that once they had a \u201cfinancial stake,\u201d C.R. and J.R. \u201cembellished and honed their original stories to add allegations of skin to skin contact and digital penetration.\u201d In other words, he opines that the girls were motivated to fine-tune their stories and fabricate additional details in order to bolster their civil suit. Of course, even if this were true (arguendo), such a motivation could have arisen at any point during the preaccusation period, regardless of when the State opened its investigation. But more to the point, Passmore had ample opportunity at trial to cross-examine C.R. and J.R. on their stories, which he did vigorously, and he had the opportunity to argue to the jury that those stories should not be believed, which he also did vigorously.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> He has not shown that his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>ability to present a defense was impaired by the alleged embellishment and honing.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">\u00b635 Third, Passmore claims he was prejudiced by the loss of evidence-specifically, a computer. In an affidavit filed in conjunction with his motion to dismiss, he states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-5\">The complaining witnesses allege that they saw me looking at pornography on a computer in 1998. That computer was mine, and I used it at the church. It has long since been disposed of. If I had known these charges were coming, I might have kept the computer to show there was no pornography on the hard drive. I cannot remember when or how I disposed of the computer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">The State contends that the District Court \u201ccured any possible prejudice resulting from the loss of the computer\u201d by excluding evidence of Passmore\u2019s alleged use of it to view pornography. Passmore maintains, however, that he was prejudiced because \u201c[t]his case was about credibility-Passmore\u2019s versus that of the complaining witnesses.\u201d He argues that with the computer he could have shown (through the testimony of a forensic analyst) that their allegations about his having viewed pornography were untruthful. Again, however, Passmore is relying on supposition. He states in his affidavit that had he known the charges were coming, he \u201cmight\u201d have kept the computer. Likewise, he asserts on appeal that \u201c[i]f \u2019 he had retained the computer and had it analyzed, \u201che would have had powerful and persuasive evidence that the complaining witnesses lacked credibility.\u201d Yet, all he can do is speculate as to whether he actually would have used this evidence, which of course would have depended on how events played out at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">\u00b636 Finally, Passmore claims he suffered \u201csevere anxiety and hardship\u201d due to the preaccusation delay. He asserts that if the State\u2019s investigation had been more timely, he \u201cwould not have wasted years building a successful career only to see it ruined.\u201d Also, his family \u201cwould have had the matter resolved, one way or another, a long time ago, versus what happened: adding a fourth child to our family and thinking that we could move on with our lives, then finding ourselves destitute and myself unemployable.\u201d He contends that his anxiety and personal hardships figure into the analysis of whether he suffered prejudice. As an initial matter, we note that his anxiety does not appear to be the result of the delay. While he claims he suffered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>anxiety during the preaccusation period, he also states that he and his family assumed they could move on with their lives, and in fact they added a fourth child to the family and he built a successful career. It appears, therefore, that his anxiety derives more from the fact that he ultimately was arrested than it does from the timing of the State\u2019s investigation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> But this point aside, anxiety suffered as a result of preaccusation delay may be a factor in the due process analysis; but without more, it does not constitute actual prejudice for purposes of establishing a due process violation. <em>See State v. Burt, </em>2000 MT 115, \u00b6 16, 299 Mont. 412, 3 P.3d 597; <em>cf. State v. Mouser, </em>806 P.2d 330, 337 n. 3 (Alaska App. 1991) (\u201cBecause anxiety, no matter how real, will not, in itself, impair the accused in defending against a charge, it does not qualify as prejudice in the due process context.\u201d). Here, Passmore has not presented any concrete, nonspeculative evidence of actual prejudice or material harm, and he has not shown that the anxiety and personal hardships he says he suffered due to preaccusation delay actually impaired his ability meaningfully to defend himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">\u00b637  In sum, Passmore has not demonstrated actual, substantial prejudice as a result of the preaccusation delay. Thus, he cannot prevail on his due process claim, and we need not consider the reasons for the delay. <em>See Krinitt, </em>251 Mont. at 36, 823 P.2d at 853. We conclude that the delay in filing charges did not violate Passmore\u2019s right to due process, and we affirm the District Court\u2019s denial of his motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">\u00b638 <em>Issue 2. Did the District Court err in denying Passmore\u2019s motion to dismiss the prosecution on the grounds of prosecutorial misconduct?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">I. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">\u00b639 The denial of a motion to dismiss in a criminal case presents a question of law, which we review de novo. <em>State v. Giddings, </em>2009 MT 61, \u00b6 42, 349 Mont. 347, 208 P.3d 363. Underlying findings of fact, however, are reviewed under the clearly erroneous standard. <em>State v. Lally, </em>2008 MT 452, \u00b6 13, 348 Mont. 59, 199 P.3d 818. A finding is clearly erroneous if it is not supported by substantial evidence, if the court has misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or if our review of the record leaves us with a definite and firm conviction that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>mistake has been made. <em>Lally, </em>\u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">II. Passmore\u2019s Motion to Dismiss for Prosecutorial Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">\u00b640 As noted, Hartwig gave Linneweber a copy of the civil complaint against Passmore and the church in September or October of 2005. Linneweber told Hartwig that he would not commence a prosecution until law enforcement had completed an investigation. Linneweber then referred the case to Detective Steffins in November 2005. Thereafter, in April 2006, Linneweber filed a criminal complaint against Passmore in Justice Court and Passmore was arrested. Linneweber then filed an information in District Court in May 2006. \u00b641 Meanwhile, Linneweber and his wife filed a civil suit against C.R. in Park County Justice Court on December 13, 2005. This suit arose out of a dispute between C.R. and Linneweber\u2019s stepdaughter, who had rented an apartment together earlier that year. The Linnewebers sought the return of a $375 rental deposit, and the Justice Court ultimately entered judgment in their favor on June 1, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">\u00b642 Given his civil suit against C .R., Linneweber decided that he could not effectively prosecute the charges against Passmore. As he explained in a July 2007 deposition, \u201cI never saw a legal or ethical conflict of interest that is defined by statute or under case law.\u201d Rather, \u201cI know that in sexual assault cases it\u2019s very important, especially where there\u2019s minors or very young adults as victims, I know it\u2019s very important that those victims have a good relationship with the prosecutor and trust the prosecutor. Since [C.R.] and my family were in a negative relationship, that was going to be a problem.\u201d For this reason, after filing the charges against Passmore, Linneweber requested the prosecutorial services of the Montana Attorney General\u2019s Office. Assistant Attorney General Carlo Canty subsequently entered his appearance as a Special Deputy Park County Attorney on June 23, 2006, and represented the State through Passmore\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">\u00b643 Passmore filed a motion to dismiss the case as a matter of due process or pursuant to the District Court\u2019s \u201cgeneral supervisory authority.\u201d He suggested that Linneweber had been \u201cinfluenced\u201d to file the charges against Passmore \u201cat the urging of private civil counsel, Mark Hartwig, prior to a full investigation into the matter.\u201d He further asserted that Linneweber\u2019s involvement in a civil suit against one of the alleged victims (C.R.) created a conflict of interest that precluded Linneweber from making the decision of whether to file charges against Passmore. In this regard, Passmore disputed Linneweber\u2019s distinction between a \u201clegal\u201d conflict and a \u201cpersonal\u201d conflict, arguing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>that \u201cconflicts corrupt objectivity\u201d regardless of their type. Relying on various rules and standards of professional conduct and on the <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>definition of \u201cconflict of interest,\u201d he argued that where there is a real or seeming incompatibility between a prosecutor\u2019s private interests and his public duties, he \u201chas no business taking <em>any </em>action charged on a case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\">\u00b644 The District Court held two hearings and thereafter denied Passmore\u2019s motion. The court disagreed with Passmore\u2019s contention that a conflict of interest existed here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-5\">Defendant\u2019s assumption is that a negative relationship with a victim in an unrelated matter constitutes a conflict of interest in the filing of a charge against the Defendant. Because that criminal filing represents an effort to seek justice under law for that very victim, it is a stretch this Court finds impossible to make. If this was indeed such an exceptional conflict of interest, why did Mr. Linneweber file charges at all? The natural course of human behavior would be to respond to this alleged \u201cnegative\u201d relationship by <em>not </em>filing any charges.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">The District Court noted that it was persuaded by Linneweber\u2019s statement that he had sought assistance from the Attorney General\u2019s Office not because he had a legal conflict of interest, but because it was imperative that the victims be willing, open, and candid in their relation with the criminal prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">III. Arguments and Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">\u00b645 Passmore argues that the charges should have been dismissed due to prosecutorial misconduct. First, he asserts that the State\u2019s affidavit in support of the Information was based on an investigation (by Steffins) that \u201cwas not directed at finding the truth but on securing a conviction.\u201d He notes that Steffins used \u201cillegal and outrageous\u201d investigative techniques. Second, he claims that Linneweber \u201cmade the charging decision at the request of a civil attorney with a financial interest in the case and agreed to work with the civil lawyers to secure a conviction.\u201d And third, Passmore contends that Linneweber made the charging decision knowing he had a conflict of interest and knowing he would have to step aside and obtain assistance from the Attorney General\u2019s Office. The basis of this supposed conflict (as explained by defense counsel\u2019s questioning at Linneweber\u2019s deposition) is as follows: Linneweber had filed suit to recover money <em>from </em>C.R., and Hartwig had filed suit (against Passmore and the church) to recover money <em>for </em>C.R.; therefore, Linneweber had an incentive to file criminal charges against Passmore in order to bolster C.R.\u2019s civil suit against Passmore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>and the church and thereby increase his chances of getting paid by C.R. Passmore maintains that Linneweber violated certain standards of professional conduct by filing the charges in spite of this conflict. According to Passmore, \u201c[a] charge brought by a prosecutor who knew he was conflicted cannot produce a result in which the community can have confidence.\u201d Consequently, he argues that \u201c[dismissal under these circumstances would preserve fairness to the defendant, deter prosecutorial misconduct and protect judicial integrity.\u201d He cites <em>United States v. Carrasco, </em>786 F.2d 1452, 1455 (9th Cir. 1986), and <em>Bank of Nova Scotia v. United States, </em>487 U.S. 250, 108 S. Ct. 2369 (1988), in support of this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">\u00b646 \u201cCharging decisions are generally within the prosecutor\u2019s exclusive domain,\u201d and \u201cthe separation of powers [doctrine] mandates judicial respect for the prosecutor\u2019s independence.\u201d <em>Carrasco, </em>786 F.2d at 1455; <em>see also State ex rel. Fletcher v. District Court, </em>260 Mont. 410, 414-15, 417-18, 859 P.2d 992, 995, 996-97 (1993). Accordingly,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-5\">an indictment will be dismissed only in flagrant cases of prosecutorial misconduct. Dismissal may be based either on constitutional grounds or on the court\u2019s exercise of its supervisory powers, and the appropriate analysis will differ accordingly. The purpose of a dismissal may be to preserve fairness to the individual defendant, to deter prosecutorial misconduct, or to protect judicial integrity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-6\"><em>Carrasco, </em>786 F.2d at 1455 (citations omitted). But dismissal is permitted only if the misconduct was prejudicial to the defendant. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 46-1-103(3), 46-20-701(2), MCA; <em>cf. Bank of Nova Scotia, </em>487 U.S. at 254-55, 108 S. Ct. at 2373-74.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">\u00b647 Here, Passmore has not demonstrated a flagrant case of prosecutorial misconduct. For one thing, his claim rests on dubious factual allegations which, for the most part, lack any support in the record. As noted, he asserts that Linneweber filed the charges against him based on a \u201ctainted investigation,\u201d at the urging of an attorney who had a financial interest in the case, and notwithstanding a \u201cconflict of interest.\u201d However, the District Court made no such findings. In fact, with regard to the alleged conflict, the court found exactly the opposite (i.e., that there was none), and the record supports the court on this point. In his deposition, Linneweber states that he requested assistance from the Attorney General\u2019s Office not because of a conflict of interest involving Passmore or C.R., but because he had had \u201cnegative interactions\u201d with C.R. \u201con a personal level.\u201d He was concerned that she and J.R. would not \u201ctrust, believe, and cooperate\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>with him in the prosecution. Furthermore, when asked flat out, Linneweber emphatically denies that he filed the charges against Passmore to facilitate C.R.\u2019s ability to pay the \u201cminiscule\u201d $375 he was seeking in the small-claims suit. Linneweber explains that he only filed that suit because C.R. had been \u201cvery stubborn and very rude to my wife and to my stepdaughter and we didn\u2019t feel it was appropriate to simply throw away the money, and that\u2019s why we went forward. We just didn\u2019t feel like she should be rewarded by us walking away.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\">\u00b648 Aside from the lack of factual support, Passmore\u2019s argument fails for two other reasons. First, it lacks legal support. This Court measures prosecutorial misconduct by reference to established norms of professional conduct. <em>State v. Martin, </em>2001 MT 83, \u00b6 63, 305 Mont. 123,23 P.3d 216. Passmore, however, has cited no cases or professional standards that define \u201cconflict of interest\u201d as he does here or that prohibit a prosecutor from filing charges under the circumstances Linneweber did here. Indeed, Passmore appears to be grasping at straws with this theory. Second, Passmore has not established prejudice. As the State points out, even if Linneweber did have a conflict of interest when he requested leave to file the Information, Passmore was not tried under that Information. Rather, he was tried under the Amended Information filed by Carlo Canty (with leave of the District Court) 14 months later.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">\u00b649  For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the District Court did not err in denying Passmore\u2019s motion to dismiss based on prosecutorial misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">\u00b650 <em>Issue 3. Did the District Court abuse its discretion in disallowing extrinsic evidence of prior statements allegedly made by one of the victims?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">I. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">\u00b651 A trial court has broad discretion in determining the relevance and admissibility of evidence. <em>State v. Hicks, </em>2006 MT 71, \u00b6 19, 331 Mont. 471, 133 P.3d 206. Thus, we generally review evidentiary rulings for an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Bomar, </em>2008 MT 91, \u00b6 14, 342 Mont. 281, 182 P.3d 47; <em>State v. Herman, </em>2009 MT 101, \u00b6 19, 350 Mont. 109, 204 P.3d 1254. A court abuses its discretion if it acts arbitrarily without the employment of conscientious judgment or exceeds the bounds of reason, resulting in substantial injustice. <em>State v. Derbyshire, </em>2009 MT 27, \u00b6 19, 349 Mont. 114, 201 P.3d 811. In exercising its discretion, however, the court is bound by the Rules of Evidence or applicable statutes. Thus, to the extent a trial court\u2019s ruling is based on an interpretation of an evidentiary rule or statute, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>our review is de novo. <em>Derbyshire, </em>\u00b6 19; <em>Bomar, </em>\u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">II. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">\u00b652 During trial, Passmore attempted to introduce evidence that C.R. had told people she fantasized about being wrapped up with duct tape and tickled. He initially broached the subject during his cross-examination of C.R.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-6\">Q. Now, you talked to some people from the church, in 1998, and told them what you allege Terry did to you. Do you recall that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-7\">A. I recall being asked to write a statement. As far as talking to people, I couldn\u2019t recall what was said. I wasn\u2019t in a very good state of mind, at that point in time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-8\">Q. So, the written account of that meeting with the church officials is not something that you\u2019ve seen recently.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-9\">A. I have never seen it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-10\">Q. Never seen it. Do you recall telling the church officials that you had fantasized about being wrapped up with duct tape and tickled?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-11\">A. I don\u2019t believe so, no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-12\">Q. Do you remember telling other people that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-13\">A. I believe, where the duct tape story came from was when I was about eight years old I had a neighbor who was kind of rowdy, in the navy, and me and sister wouldn\u2019t leave him alone, so he duct taped me so I couldn\u2019t bother him anymore. I might have told somebody that story, maybe Terry or Levi, but it was never a fantasy of mine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-14\">Q. I\u2019m not trying to get into your fantasies.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-15\">A. That\u2019s what you said.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-16\">Q. Is it Ms. [R.]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-17\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-18\">Q. Ms. [R.], I\u2019m just asking you if you told people.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-19\">A. No, I\u2019ve never told anybody that was my fantasy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-20\">Q. So, you say you might have told Levi and Terry about that, but you didn\u2019t tell them about fantasizing about it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-21\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b234-22\">\u00b653 Passmore later revisited this subject during his direct examination of Levi Haefs. Haefs had attended the Livingston Church of God during the period when Passmore was pastor and had helped with the construction of the shed next to the parsonage in 1998. Haefs was 13 years old back then and had been friends with C.R. Passmore asked Haefs whether he ever heard C.R. \u201cdescribing anything that she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>had thought about regarding duct tape.\u201d Haefs answered affirmatively and stated that this had occurred while he, C.R., and Passmore were doing work on the shed. After the prosecution twice objected to this line of questioning, the court held an in-chambers conference (with counsel, Passmore, and Haefs present), at which Passmore made the following offer of proof:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-4\">Q. Levi, first of all, is there anything else, in addition to what you\u2019ve already said, out there, as far as who was there and how it got brought up? In fact, you were starting to tell us how it had gotten brought up, when we had to stop. So, let\u2019s have you finish with that. How did it get brought up in the first place?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-5\">A. I believe it was something fairly innocent, as in [C.R.] asking me if I\u2019m ticklish.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-6\">Q. Alright. Then what happened?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-7\">A. Then she said that she wished that she could be bound with duct tape and tickled with a feather, naked.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-8\">Q. Was that the whole extent of her statement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-9\">A. That was it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b235-10\">\u00b654 The prosecutor opined that this would be inadmissible hearsay, but Passmore explained that C.R.\u2019s statement to Haefs was being offered \u201cnot to prove that that\u2019s what she really wanted, but to prove that that\u2019s what she really said.\u201d He asserted that it was evidence of a prior inconsistent statement (which by definition is not hearsay, <em>see </em>M. R. Evid. 801(d)(1)(A)), and he argued that he should be allowed to present this testimony to the jury because it contradicted C.R.\u2019s earlier testimony and thereby called her credibility into question. The prosecutor, however, contended that the testimony was being offered simply to besmirch C.R.\u2019s character, and he questioned whether it was barred by the rape shield law (\u00a7 45-5-511(2), MCA). He also argued that the evidence, in any event, had very little probative value and was unfairly prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-11\">\u00b655 The District Court ultimately decided to exclude the evidence. Relying on <em>State v. </em>Detonancour, 2001 MT 213, 306 Mont. 389, 34 P.3d 487, the court reasoned that \u201c[a]n examination of the nuances of the victim\u2019s nonsexual interactions, and I\u2019m going to add where the defendant was present, would effectively put the victim on trial.\u201d Furthermore, relying on <em>State v. Higley, </em>190 Mont. 412, 621 P.2d 1043 (1980), the court reasoned that \u201cthe character of the victim is not at issue and her sexual views are not probative of her truthfulness.\u201d The court concluded that \u201cit\u2019s clearly within my discretion to exclude this evidence because it\u2019s very, very prejudicial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b236-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>III. Arguments and Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">\u00b656 On appeal, Passmore contends that the District Court erroneously relied on the rape shield law (which we discussed in both <em>Detonancour </em>and <em>Higley) </em>in disallowing the proffered testimony by Haefs. The rape shield law states that evidence concerning the \u201csexual conduct\u201d of the victim is inadmissible in sex-crime prosecutions (except in narrow circumstances), <em>see </em>\u00a7 45-5-511(2), MCA, and we have previously rejected a broad definition of \u201csexual conduct,\u201d <em>see Detonancour, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 23-24 (declining to adopt a proposed definition that included \u201clingering touches, smoldering glances, the surreptuous [sic] passing of notes, casual contact between persons at social gatherings, and other methods of flirtatious behavior which form the invitation to engage in consensual sexual contact or sexual intercourse\u201d). Yet, as the State points out, the District Court characterized Haefs\u2019 proffered testimony as describing a \u201cnonsexual interaction,\u201d not \u201csexual conduct.\u201d Thus, the issue here is whether the court\u2019s ruling conforms to the Rules of Evidence, not the rape shield law.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">\u00b657 In this regard, Passmore contends that Haefs\u2019 testimony was admissible \u201cas a prior inconsistent statement on the issue of C.R.\u2019s character for truthfulness.\u201d In addition, he contends that the testimony was relevant because \u201c[C.R.\u2019s] allegations against Passmore involved tickling-if she imagined scenarios that included tickling it supports Passmore\u2019s assertion that she made the stories up.\u201d Passmore argues that this case was \u201ca contest between the credibility of the complainants and the defendant\u201d and thus he should have been allowed to \u201cexpos[e] a prior inconsistent statement that would have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>impeached [C.R.\u2019s] credibility and explained the source of her allegations against Passmore.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">\u00b658 In response, the State contends that the evidence in question was simply not probative of whether Passmore sexually assaulted and engaged in nonconsensual sexual intercourse with C.R. The State argues that even if C.R. imagined scenarios that included tickling, this fact does not support Passmore\u2019s claim that she \u201cmade the stories up,\u201d given that Passmore acknowledged at trial that he had tickled her on more than one occasion. Finally, the State asserts that the evidence was offered to impeach C.R. on a collateral matter, and the State maintains that the District Court properly excluded it under M. R. Evid. 403 for being substantially more prejudicial than probative.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">\u00b659 Initially, we note that Passmore proposed to use Haefs\u2019 testimony to impeach C.R. by contradiction. Impeachment by contradiction occurs when a party attacks the credibility of a witness by offering evidence to prove that a fact which the witness asserted or relied upon in her testimony is not true. <em>Wegener v. Johnson, </em>527 F.3d 687, 691 (8th Cir. 2008). Contradiction evidence undermines credibility in two ways: first, it permits the inference that the witness either lied or was mistaken with respect to the specific fact contradicted; and second, since contradiction tends to show that the witness erred or lied with respect to one fact, the jury could infer that the witness is generally an unreliable source of information and erred or lied with respect to other facts (the point Passmore sought to make using Haefs\u2019 testimony here). <em>See </em>Charles Alan Wright &amp; Victor James Gold, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure </em>vol. 27, \u00a7 6096, 656-57 (2d ed., West 2007). Of course, this inference is not always warranted. For example, a witness might make a mistake in recalling a trivial detail (e.g., the color of socks he was wearing on the date in question) but still be able to testify accurately as to more significant details (e.g., that he observed the defendant attack the victim). <em>See id. </em>at 657. Also, the costs and dangers associated with contradiction evidence can be high. For example, where the contradicted fact is immaterial, the jury could become distracted and confused by the attention given to the contradiction and may attach undue importance to extraneous matters. The jury could also be inclined to misuse evidence when the contradiction reveals prejudicial facts about a witness (as the State suggests could have happened here). Furthermore, time may be wasted pursuing contradictions that reveal nothing directly about the facts in issue and little about the credibility of the witnesses. <em>See id. </em>at 658; Kenneth S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>Broun, <em>McCormick on Evidence </em>vol. 1, \u00a7 45, 214-15 (6th ed., West 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">\u00b660 For these reasons, courts long have held that when contradiction concerns a \u201ccollateral matter\u201d (i.e., a matter that is not relevant for a purpose other than to contradict a witness\u2019s in-court testimony), the contradiction may be proved only through the testimony of the witness to be impeached, and extrinsic evidence (i.e., evidence offered through other witnesses, rather than through the witness to be impeached) is inadmissible to contradict the witness on the collateral matter. <em>See </em>Wright <em>&amp; </em>Gold, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure </em>\u00a7 6096, at 659; Broun, <em>McCormick on Evidence </em>\u00a7 49, at 232; <em>United States v. Mulinelli-Navas, </em>111 F.3d 983, 988 (1st Cir. 1997); <em>United States v. Hayes, </em>369 F.3d 564, 567 (D.C. Cir. 2004); <em>Jezdik v. State, </em>110 P.3d 1058, 1063 (Nev. 2005). Thus, only contradictions as to noncollateral matters<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> may be proved both by extrinsic evidence and by the testimony of the witness himself. Wright &amp; Gold, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure </em>\u00a7 6096, at 659. It should be noted that this \u201ccollateral-fact rule\u201d (barring extrinsic contradictory evidence concerning a collateral matter) does not apply to attacks on a witness\u2019s bias, interest, corruption, coercion, mental or perceptual capacity, or lack of personal knowledge or to impeachment using a prior conviction. Rather, it applies to impeachment using a prior inconsistent statement, impeachment using an untruthful act that has not resulted in a conviction, and specific contradiction. <em>See id. </em>at 659 n. 14, 661; Broun, <em>McCormick on Evidence </em>\u00a7 49, at 233-37; <em>Jezdik, </em>110 P.3d at 1064.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">\u00b661  It has been suggested that the collateral-fact rule is too mechanistic and that the better approach is to apply the discretionary balancing of Fed. R. Evid. 403. <em>See </em>Broun, <em>McCormick on Evidence </em>\u00a7 49, at 237; <em>see also </em>Wright &amp; Gold, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure </em>\u00a7 6096, at 662-64. Notably, a number of federal courts have determined that Rule 607 authorizes impeachment by contradiction and Rule 403 governs its application. <em>See United States v. Gilmore, </em>553 F.3d 266, 271 (3d Cir. 2009); <em>United States v. Castillo, </em>181 F.3d 1129, 1132-33 (9th Cir. 1999); <em>see also United States v. Fonseca, </em>435 F.3d 369, 375 (D.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>Cir. 2006); 28 U.S.C. app. Fed. R. Evid. 608, Advisory Committee Notes on 2003 Amendment, at 346 (2006). Such an approach is suggested for Montana courts in the Commission Comments to M. R. Evid. 607:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-4\">The many cases considering collateral matters indicate that it is a troublesome doctrine. The Commission believes that the limitation of impeachment by Rule 401, defining relevant evidence as including impeaching evidence, and Rule 403, allowing the court to exclude relevant evidence if its probative value is outweighed by prejudice, confusion or waste of time, will allow the same result to be reached through a more flexible means than currently used with the collateral matters rule.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">We agree with these comments and conclude that while the collateral or noncollateral nature of the evidence at issue may be a factor to consider, the admissibility and use of contradiction evidence (whether extrinsic or the testimony of the witness himself) is to be governed by M. R. Evid. 401<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and 403<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and any other applicable rule of evidence. This is consistent with our approach of eschewing common law doctrines of evidence and instead using the specific statute or rule of evidence that applies to the particular factual situation presented in order to determine the admissibility of the evidence at issue. <em>See e.g. State v. Hansen, </em>1999 MT 253, \u00b6\u00b6 72-84, 296 Mont. 282, 989 P.2d 338. Rule 403 identifies the factors pertinent to determining the admissibility of contradiction evidence, and the trial court must carefully apply those factors in deciding whether and to what extent such evidence may be introduced.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">\u00b662 Here, Passmore argues that Haefs\u2019 proffered testimony about what C.R. told him is evidence of a prior inconsistent statement. M. R. Evid. 801(d)(1)(A) provides that a prior oral or written statement inconsistent with the declarant\u2019s trial testimony is admissible, and M. R. Evid. 613(b) provides that extrinsic evidence of a prior inconsistent statement is admissible so long as the witness is afforded an opportunity to explain or deny the same and the opposite party is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>afforded an opportunity to interrogate the witness thereon. \u201cThe attack by prior inconsistent statement is not based on the theory that the present testimony is false and the former statement true. Rather, the attack rests on the notion that talking one way on the stand and another way previously is blowing hot and cold, raising a doubt as to the truthfulness of both statements.\u201d Broun, <em>McCormick on Evidence </em>\u00a7 34, at 151; <em>see also United States </em>v. <em>Winchenbach, </em>197 F.3d 548, 558 (1st Cir. 1999) (explaining that Rule 613(b) permits extrinsic evidence of a prior inconsistent statement to show that a witness\u2019s statement at trial is irreconcilably at odds with the one made previously, thus calling the declarant\u2019s credibility into question, but Rule 608(b) bars extrinsic evidence of specific instances of a witness\u2019s conduct offered to impugn his character for truthfulness).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">\u00b663 Of course, as just explained, the admissibility of such evidence is also subject to Rule 403, and that is where Passmore\u2019s claim fails. We agree with the State that the evidence in question (that C.R. told Haefs she wished she could be bound with duct tape and tickled with a feather naked) was unfairly prejudicial. Indeed, it effectively would have put C.R. on trial, <em>cf. Detonancour, </em>\u00b6 24, and it easily could have caused the jury to attach undue importance to an extraneous and prejudicial matter. Moreover, this evidence would have been cumulative insofar as Passmore was able to present other evidence from which he then argued to the jury that C.R. had \u201cmade up\u201d the allegations against him. <em>See </em>\u00b6 34 n. 6, <em>supra. </em>And in terms of undermining C.R.\u2019s credibility, the evidence had limited probative value in establishing the inference that because C.R. erred or lied with respect to what she told Haefs, she erred or lied with respect to her testimony about Passmore\u2019s sexual acts with her.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In short, the probative value of Haefs\u2019 proffered testimony was substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, and needless presentation of cumulative evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">\u00b664  A trial court has broad discretion to exclude evidence under M. R. Evid. 403. <em>See State v. McClean, </em>179 Mont. 178, 186, 587 P.2d 20, 25 (1978); <em>State v. Grixti, </em>2005 MT 296, \u00b6 22, 329 Mont. 330, 124 P.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>177, <em>overruled in part on other grounds, Whitlow v. State, </em>2008 MT 140, \u00b6 18 n. 4, 343 Mont. 90, 183 P.3d 861. Passmore has not shown that the District Court abused that discretion. We accordingly affirm the court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">\u00b665 <em>Issue 4. Did the District Court abuse its discretion in excluding testimony from a defense witness that Passmore lacked the character traits of a sex offender?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">\u00b666 The standard of review here is the same as under Issue 3. <em>See </em>\u00b6 51, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">\u00b667 Prior to trial, Passmore disclosed his intention to call sex-offender evaluator Michael D. Sullivan, MSW, \u201cto testify as an expert witness in the instant case, inasmuch as Mr. Sullivan conducted an evaluation of Mr. Passmore, which revealed that he does not have the characteristics of a sex offender as a result of an extensive assessment.\u201d The State responded with a motion in limine to exclude this proposed expert testimony based on M. R. Evid. 702 and <em>State v. Bailey, </em>2004 MT 87, 320 Mont. 501, 87 P.3d 1032. The District Court held a hearing and thereafter granted the State\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">\u00b668 On appeal, Passmore notes that he did not offer this testimony for purposes of bolstering his own credibility. Rather, he offered Sullivan\u2019s testimony pursuant to M. R. Evid. 404(a), 405(a), 702, and 704. In relevant part, these rules state as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-8\">Rule 404(a): \u201cEvidence of a person\u2019s character or a trait of character is not admissible for the purpose of proving action in conformity therewith on a particular occasion, except: (1) Character of accused. Evidence of a pertinent trait of character offered by an accused ....\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-9\">Rule 405(a): \u201cIn all cases in which evidence of character or a trait of character of a person is admissible, proof may be made ... by testimony in the form of an opinion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-10\">Rule 702: \u201cIf scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-11\">Rule 704: \u201cTestimony in the form of an opinion or inference otherwise admissible is not objectionable because it embraces an ultimate issue to be decided by the trier of fact.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b241-12\">Based on these provisions and several cases from other jurisdictions, Passmore maintains that expert testimony regarding whether a defendant possesses the character traits of a sex offender is admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>\u00b669 The chief case relied on by Passmore is <em>State v. Davis, </em>645 N. W.2d 913 (Wis. 2002). Similar to the present case, the defendant in <em>Davis </em>sought to introduce evidence to show that he lacked the psychological characteristics of a sex offender and, therefore, was unlikely to have committed the charged crime. The court held that such evidence \u201cmay be admissible\u201d under Wisconsin\u2019s rules of evidence governing character evidence and expert testimony (which are identical in pertinent respects to the Montana rules quoted above). <em>See Davis, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 2, 26. The court first observed that an accused may introduce evidence of a \u201cpertinent\u201d trait of his character, meaning the character evidence must relate to a fact or proposition that is of consequence to the determination of the action and have a tendency to establish that consequential proposition. Next, the court noted that a defendant may introduce such relevant character evidence through opinion testimony. Lastly, the court observed that expert testimony is permitted when specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand evidence or to determine a fact in issue. <em>See Davis, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 16-17. From this, the court reasoned on the facts presented:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-4\">Davis\u2019s expert will allegedly testify to the general character traits of sexual offenders, the tests used to determine whether an individual possesses such character traits, his findings on whether Davis possesses such character traits, and, based on these results, the likelihood that Davis committed the sexual assault. Such traits regarding the defendant\u2019s propensity to commit sexual assault are pertinent traits of his character. This evidence relates to a consequential fact, that is, whether the defendant committed sexual misconduct with a child. Further, this evidence has probative value in sexual assault cases, where there is often no neutral witness to the assault and there is seldom any physical evidence implicating the defendant. Such profile evidence may be extremely important to the defense. Such testimony may also be useful to the trier of fact, helping it to determine a fact in issue, that is, whether the defendant committed the crime, by showing circumstantial evidence of the defendant\u2019s innocence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-5\"><em>Davis, </em>\u00b6 18. The court noted, however, that the trial court has \u201cdiscretion in admitting such evidence\u201d and is entrusted to act as a gatekeeper with the power to exclude \u201cunduly prejudicial evidence.\u201d <em>See Davis, </em>\u00b6 21; <em>see also State v. Walters, </em>675 N.W.2d 778, \u00b6\u00b6 2, 24, 25, 28 (Wis. 2004) (such evidence is subject to the rules of evidence, particularly rule 403\u2019s balancing test, and the decision to admit or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>exclude it is discretionary).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">\u00b670 Passmore also cites <em>People v. Stoll, </em>783 P.2d 698 (Cal. 1989), and <em>Nolte v. State, </em>854 S.W.2d 304 (Tex. App. 3d Dist. 1993). In <em>Stoll, </em>the court reversed the convictions because the trial court had erroneously excluded a defense psychologist\u2019s opinion testimony that the defendants displayed a \u201cnormal personality function\u201d and showed no \u201cindications of deviancy.\u201d 783 P.2d at 699-700, 707-08. The court observed that under California\u2019s rules of evidence, an accused may present expert opinion testimony to show his nondisposition to commit a charged sex offense. <em>Id. </em>at 708. In this regard, the court noted that \u201clack of deviance\u201d is a relevant character trait in a lewd-and-lascivious-conduct case. <em>Id. </em>In contrast, the court in <em>Nolte </em>concluded that the proffered testimony, which would have compared the defendant\u2019s psychological profile with that of the typical sexual abuser, simply was not character evidence under Tex. R. Crim. Evid. 405(a) and, thus, should not have been excluded under this rule. 854 S.W.2d at 308-10.</p>\n<p id=\"AHC\">\u00b671 The State counters that more courts have rejected \u201csex-offender profile testimony\u201d than have allowed it. As support for this proposition, the State directs our attention to <em>People v. Dobek, </em>732 N.W.2d 546, 575 (Mich. App. 2007) (listing courts that have rejected such testimony), and James Aaron George, Student Author, <em>Offender Profiling and Expert Testimony: Scientifically Valid or Glorified Results? </em>61 Vand. L. Rev. 221, 240 n. 109 (2008) (listing jurisdictions that have rejected sex-offender profiling offered by the prosecution and jurisdictions that have rejected sex-offender profiling offered by the defendant). In <em>State v. Parkinson, </em>909 P.2d 647 (Idaho App. 1996) (cited in <em>Dobek), </em>the court noted that \u201c[vjarious reasons have been given for rejection of this type of evidence, including that it has not gained general acceptance in the scientific community, that it invades the province of the jury and unfairly prejudices the prosecution, and that it does not assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 651; <em>see also State v. Hughes, </em>841 So. 2d 718, 721 (La. 2003). The <em>Dobek </em>court cited similar reasons in its decision. The court first concluded that evidence regarding the defendant\u2019s sex-offender profile did not meet the requirements of Mich. R. Evid. 702. Specifically, the court held that the proffered testimony was not sufficiently scientifically reliable and was not supported by sufficient scientific data. <em>Dobek, </em>732 N.W.2d at 571-72. The court also concluded that the evidence would not assist the trier of fact in understanding the evidence or in determining a fact in issue, but rather would more likely confuse the jury and distract it from focusing on the pertinent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 572. Thus, the court held that even if the evidence were admissible under Mich. R. Evid. 702, any minimal probative value would be substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury. <em>Id. </em>In this regard, the court expressed concern that the evidence, purporting to answer the question of whether the defendant committed a sexual offense, could be given disproportionate weight by the jury and considered conclusive proof of guilt or innocence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">\u00b672 These extrajurisdictional cases aside, the State also argues that under <em>State v. Spencer, </em>2007 MT 245, 339 Mont. 227, 169 P.3d 384, the District Court did not abuse its discretion in excluding Sullivan\u2019s proposed testimony because its probative value was substantially outweighed by the danger of confusing the issues or misleading the jury. In <em>Spencer, </em>the defendant was accused of having sexual intercourse without consent with two young girls, and he sought to introduce testimony by a licensed clinical psychologist that he did not meet the diagnostic criteria of a pedophile. <em>Spencer, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 6, 9-10. We affirmed the exclusion of this evidence, noting that it was \u201cpertinent character evidence,\u201d <em>Spencer, </em>\u00b6 37, but concluding that \u201cwhatever relevance [the] testimony may have possessed, the dangers of confusing the issues or misleading the jury substantially outweighed its probative value, and thus it ran afoul of M. R. Evid. 403,\u201d <em>Spencer, </em>\u00b6 41.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">\u00b673 Based on <em>Spencer </em>and the extrajurisdictional cases cited by Passmore and the State, we conclude that there is neither a per se rule requiring admission, nor a per se rule requiring exclusion, of evidence that a defendant does not possess (or does possess<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>) the character traits of a sex offender. Rather, admissibility depends on a careful application of M. R. Evid. 403, 404(a)(1), 405(a), and 702. In the present case, Passmore forcefully argues that Sullivan\u2019s testimony was admissible under Rules 404(a)(1) and 405(a). However, he fails to provide any analysis, let alone a complete record,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> on the question of whether Sullivan\u2019s testimony would meet the requirements of Rule 702. Insofar as Rule 702 is concerned, Passmore\u2019s argument is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>insufficient under M. R. App. P. 12(l)(f). Furthermore, we agree with the State that the District Court was well within its discretion in concluding that on the facts here, any probative value Sullivan\u2019s testimony may have had was substantially outweighed by the danger of confusing the issues or misleading the jury. M. R. Evid. 403; <em>cf. Spencer, </em>\u00b6 41.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">\u00b674  Passmore has not shown that the District Court abused its discretion in excluding testimony from Sullivan that Passmore lacked the character traits of a sex offender. We accordingly affirm the court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">\u00b675 The District Court did not err in denying Passmore\u2019s motion to dismiss the prosecution on the grounds of preaccusation delay and in denying his motion to dismiss the prosecution on the grounds of prosecutorial misconduct. Likewise, the court did not abuse its discretion in disallowing extrinsic evidence of prior statements allegedly made by C.R. and in excluding testimony from Sullivan that Passmore lacked the character traits of a sex offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">\u00b676 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b245-8\">JUSTICES COTTER, RICE and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b219-12\"> The jury ultimately acquitted Passmore of all charges involving A.M.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b221-12\"> Although some of our cases use the term \u201cpreindictment,\u201d we use the term \u201cpreaccusation\u201d here. For one thing, the prosecution against Passmore was commenced by a complaint, not an indictment. Moreover, the term \u201cpreaccusation\u201d better reflects the fact that there are several methods of commencing a prosecution, <em>see </em>\u00a7 46-11-101, MCA, and the fact that the right at issue here applies to the period before official accusation. (The speedy trial right applies postaccusation.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b223-6\"> In the present case, there is no dispute that the prosecution was commenced within the statute of limitations. <em>See </em>\u00a7 45-l-205(l)(b), MCA (1997) (5 years after the victim reaches the age of 18; J.R. reached 18 in 2002, and C.R. reached 18 in 2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b224-5\"> Citing <em>City of Billings v. Bruce, </em>1998 MT 186, 290 Mont. 148, 965 P.2d 866, Passmore contends that \u201cthere comes a point when the delay is presumptively prejudicial and the burden shifts to the prosecution to rebut the presumption.\u201d <em>Bruce, </em>however, has been overruled on this point, <em>see State v. Ariegwe, </em>2007 MT 204, \u00b6\u00b6 56-58, 338 Mont. 442, 167 P.3d 815, and there is no such burden-shifting rule applicable to preaccusation delay claims in any event. Passmore also cites \u00b6 37 of <em>Bruce </em>for the proposition that \u201c \u2018excessive delay presumptively compromises the reliability of a trial in ways that neither party can prove or for that matter identify.\u2019 \u201d This statement, however, concerns speedy trial analysis; and preaccusation delay is tested by general proscriptions of due process, not the \u201cmore stringent requirements\u201d of the speedy trial right. <em>See United States v. Sandoval, </em>990 F.2d 481, 485 n. 8 (9th Cir. 1993). In this regard, it should be noted that unlike the protection against oppressive preaccusation delay, the protection against oppressive postaccusation delay is specifically affirmed in the Constitution. <em>See Barker v. Wingo, </em>407 U.S. 514, 533, 92 S. Ct. 2182, 2193 (1972). Moreover, the Speedy Trial Clause and the Due Process Clause balance different sets of interests in their respective arenas. <em>See Marion, </em>404 U.S. at 320, 92 S. Ct. at 463; <em>Barker, </em>407 U.S. at 519-22, 92 S. Ct. at <em>2186-88; Lovasco, </em>431 U.S. at 790-96, 97 S. Ct. at 2049-52. Thus, rules designed to implement the speedy trial right may not be appropriate for addressing preaccusation delays under the Due Process Clause. The presumption of prejudice applicable to speedy trial claims <em>(see Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 44-56, 99) is one such rule. <em>Schaffer, </em>586 F.3d at 425.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b225-6\"> This Court has applied the foregoing two-prong test in a number of cases. <em>See e.g. Krinitt, </em>251 Mont. at 34-36, 823 P.2d at 852-53 (no violation); <em>State v. Flesch, </em>254 Mont. 529, 532-35, 839 P.2d 1270, 1272-73 (1992) (no violation); <em>Taylor, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 20-34 (violation); <em>State v. Burt, </em>2000 MT 115, \u00b6\u00b6 15-16, 299 Mont. 412, 3 P.3d 597 (no violation); <em>State v. Wright, </em>2000 MT 322, \u00b6\u00b6 23-33, 302 Mont. 527, 17 P.3d 982 (no violation); <em>DuBray, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 28-35 (no violation). As indicated by the numerous citations to federal cases in the text above, this test derives from federal interpretations of the federal Constitution. Although Passmore notes that the Montana Constitution has its own Due Process Clause (Article II, Section 17), which is a separate and enforceable constitutional right insofar as the jurisdiction of the State of Montana extends, <em>see State v. West, </em>2008 MT 338, \u00b6 27, 346 Mont. 244, 194 P.3d 683, he presents no argument that Article II, Section 17 requires a different analysis or a greater protection against preaccusation delay than under the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b227-6\"> For example, Passmore argued repeatedly to the jury that the girls\u2019 stories were \u201cmade up.\u201d He also argued that C.R. and A.M. had discussed the specifics of their respective stories so as not to contradict each other at trial. \u201c[T]hey just didn\u2019t want to step on each other\u2019s stories, and create problems for each other by [C.R.] testifying to things that [A.M.] might not testify to as having been the specifics of her story, and vice versa, [A.M.] didn\u2019t want to testify about specifics that [C.R.] told her in fear that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>might complicate [C.R.\u2019s] ability to make up things and not be impeached.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b229-8\"> Indeed, in his affidavit Passmore states: \u201cIn 2001-03,1 went to school to learn computer technology. I began to build a successful career, working as an independent contractor for the federal government, and my income eventually was $85,000 annually. All of that changed abruptly when I was arrested on April 11, 2006.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b236-6\"> Passmore also cites his constitutional right of confrontation. In response, the State contends that he did not present a constitutional challenge in the District Court. <em>See State v. Morrison, </em>2008 MT 16, \u00b6 10, 341 Mont. 147, 176 P.3d 1027 (issues presented for the first time on appeal are untimely). Furthermore, citing <em>State v. Wilson, </em>2007 MT 327, \u00b6 45, 340 Mont. 191, 172 P.3d 1264, and <em>Holmes v. South Carolina, </em>547 U.S. 319, 326-27, 126 S. Ct. 1727, 1732 (2006), the State points out that the Confrontation Clause permits trial judges to limit evidence based on concerns of repetitiveness, relevance, harassment, prejudice, or confusion of the issues. In response, Passmore suggests that \u201cthe substance\u201d of his argument at trial included a constitutional challenge. That does not appear to be the case; but even if it were, he has failed to explain on appeal how the District Court\u2019s ruling was inconsistent with the principles stated in <em>Wilson </em>and <em>Holmes. </em>Moreover, although he offers <em>Holley v. Yarborough, </em>568 F.3d 1091 (9th Cir. 2009), as supplemental authority, the <em>Holley </em>opinion actually underscores the inadequacy of his briefing here. <em>Holley </em>reflects a fact-intensive analysis of the relevance, probative value, and prejudicial value of the impeachment evidence, including the proportionality of the limits imposed by the trial court. <em>See id. </em>at 1099-1100. Passmore, however, simply relies on generalized assertions about the right to confront witnesses. This is insufficient under M. R. App. P. 12(l)(f). <em>See e.g. State v. White, </em>2008 MT 464, \u00b6 29, 348 Mont. 196, 199 P.3d 274. We accordingly will not address the right-of-conffontation issue any further.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b238-6\"> There are three generally recognized categories of noncollateral facts: facts that are admissible to prove substantive issues in the case; facts that are admissible to impeach or disqualify the witness on grounds other than contradiction (e.g., bias); and any part of the witness\u2019s account of the background and circumstances of a material transaction which as a matter of human experience he would not have been mistaken about if his story were true (e.g., the fact that the accident at issue occurred during a blizzard on a moonless night, rather than on a sunny day as the witness described). <em>See </em>Wright &amp; Gold, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure </em>\u00a7 6096, at 659-62.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b239-7\"> \u201cRelevant evidence means evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.

Here, by contrast, C.R. was incapable of giving legal consent, <em>see </em>\u00a7\u00a7 45-5-501(l)(b)(iii), -502(5), MCA (1997), and so her alleged tickling fantasy was not probative in the way the rape fantasy was in <em>Garcia.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b244-6\"> Under M.
