Whether the District Court erred by denying Lacey\u2019s motion to dismiss for a violation of his constitutional right to a speedy trial.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b58-12\">\u00b64 <em>II. Whether the District Court erred by denying Lacey\u2019s motion in limine and allowing the State to present evidence that Lacey provided intoxicating substances and made sexual advances to young men other than the named victim.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b58-13\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b58-14\">\u00b65 This case arises out of Lacey\u2019s alleged sexual intercourse without consent with J.G. While the facts are generally not in dispute, we review those facts that are relevant to the issues presented on appeal. During the spring of 1997, Lacey moved from Bozeman, Montana to Southern California where he lived with his aunt and cousin for approximately three months. Unable to find work, Lacey moved to Texas where his mother and family ranch were located. In August 1997, Lacey briefly returned to Bozeman, collected his belongings and returned to Texas. While in Texas, Lacey received letters from his son and daughter in Bozeman indicating that there were rumors and allegations that Lacey had engaged in \u201cinappropriate [sexual] behavior\u201d with several of his former Bozeman employees. Lacey responded to these allegations in a letter to his daughter indicating that the rumors were untrue and that he had not been involved in any inappropriate behavior. He also indicated that he believed he was dying of cancer and that he was going to Mexico to seek treatment. Nevertheless, in November 1997, some six months after Lacey left <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>Montana, the Gallatin County Sheriffs Office began investigating allegations that Lacey had sexually abused one or more young men whom he had befriended and employed.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\">\u00b66 In February 1998, the Gallatin County Sheriffs Office submitted its investigation to Deputy Gallatin County Attorney Jane Mersen (Mersen) for prosecution. As Lacey was not in Gallatin County at the time, a detective was employed to locate him. On February 10, 1998, law enforcement requested assistance from the Rocky Mountain Information Network (RMIN) in locating Lacey. RMIN searched for criminal history, civil filings, driver\u2019s license inquiries, recent addresses and utility records in Lacey\u2019s name. Despite this extensive search, the only information RMIN found was that Lacey owned property in Alice, Texas which was subject to a federal tax lien. A trace based on credit also revealed two post office boxes for Lacey in Alice, Texas. On April 7, 1999, having failed to locate him for questioning, Gallatin County charged Lacey by Information with two counts of sexual intercourse without consent. The Information alleged Lacey knowingly had sexual intercourse without the consent of J.G., a male over the age of sixteen. The county attorney obtained a warrant and extradition request indicating that, if another jurisdiction arrested Lacey, the State of Montana would extradite him. The warrant and extradition request were input onto the National Criminal Information Center (NCIC) database. On April 9, 1999, Mersen also met with Lacey\u2019s daughter and ex-wife who both informed Mersen that they believed Lacey was in Mexico. This information was relayed on to the Gallatin County Sheriffs Office to aid in their search for Lacey. Despite this information, neither the detective working on the case nor the Gallatin County Sheriff s Office attempted to contact United States Border Patrol. While these events were unfolding in Montana, Lacey had been on the move.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">\u00b67 After spending time in Texas, Lacey moved to California and then Mexico where he allegedly saw a doctor regarding what he believed to be testicular cancer. After working for several months on sailing boats in Mexico, Lacey found employment sailing back up the Baja Peninsula to San Diego, California. Over the next four years, Lacey moved back and forth between Catalina, California and Mexico, working on sailing and fishing boats and as a caretaker for various properties. During this time Lacey was paid in cash and did not own or rent property in his name. He also crossed the U.S./Mexico border multiple times using his Montana driver\u2019s license for identification purposes. In February 2003, Lacey purchased a vehicle in Arizona and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>moved to Las Vegas, Nevada where he obtained a job selling outdoor barbecues and kitchens.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">\u00b68 In 2005 the Gallatin County Sheriffs Office received information that Lacey had obtained a car salesman\u2019s license in Nevada but that he had been fired from the dealership where he worked. Nevada law enforcement attempted to locate and serve Lacey with the Montana warrant but was unable to locate him. In fact Lacey, who had started a hot sauce company registered in his name with the State of Nevada, had moved to Arizona where the hot sauce bottler was located. On November 8, 2007, Lacey was arrested in Flagstaff, Arizona after he was \u201cpicked up\u201d on the NCIC database.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">\u00b69 After his arrest in Arizona, Lacey was returned to Montana and made his initial appearance on December 3, 2007. After the omnibus hearing was continued six times at Lacey\u2019s request, it was finally held and trial was scheduled for October 7, 2008. The Omnibus Hearing Order indicated that, pursuant to M. R. Evid. 404(b) and \u00a7 46-13-109, MCA, the State did not intend to introduce evidence of other crimes, wrongs or acts and that Lacey intended to file a motion in limine. The District Court ordered that the motion \u201cshall be filed on or before June 13, 2008.\u201d On June 13, 2008, Lacey filed a motion to dismiss arguing that the State of Montana failed to \u201cprovide [him] with a speedy trial guaranteed by the Montana and Federal Constitutions.\u201d In its order denying Lacey\u2019s motion to dismiss, the District Court addressed the balancing test this Court laid out in <em>State v. Ariegwe, </em>2007 MT 204, 338 Mont. 442, 167 P.3d 815, and concluded that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-6\">In light of the evidence indicating that the Defendant deliberately avoided being brought to trial in this matter, the authority cited herein requires the Court to attribute the majority of pretrial delay to the Defendant. Consequently ... the Defendant\u2019s speedy trial challenge is without merit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">On October 1, 2008, Lacey also filed a motion in limine to exclude evidence of \u201cother bad acts\u201d including evidence showing he provided intoxicating substances to and made sexual advances on young men other than J.G. During the pretrial conference, the District Court denied the motions reasoning that, having been filed after the June 13, 2008 deadline, they were untimely. The District Court also adopted the State\u2019s argument on the merits, concluding that the evidence was admissible pursuant to the transaction rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-8\">\u00b610 Ultimately, the jury returned a verdict of guilty on both counts of sexual intercourse without consent and Lacey was sentenced to 20 years in Montana State Prison with 10 years suspended to be served <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>consecutively for each count. Lacey appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">\u00b611 In order to address a speedy trial claim a district court must first make findings of fact <em>.Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 119. This Court reviews those factual findings to determine whether they are clearly erroneous. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 119. A district court\u2019s factual findings are clearly erroneous if they are not supported by substantial credible evidence, if the court has misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or if a review of the record leaves this Court with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 119; <em>Ray v. Nansel, </em>2002 MT 191, \u00b6 19, 311 Mont. 135, 53 P.3d 870. While the factual findings are reviewed under the clearly erroneous standard, whether those facts amount to a violation of the defendant\u2019s right to a speedy trial is a question of constitutional law. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 119. We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law de novo to determine whether the court\u2019s interpretation and application of the law are correct. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 119.</p>\n<p id=\"AVR\">\u00b612 A district court\u2019s decision to grant or deny a motion in limine is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Ayers, </em>2003 MT 114, \u00b6 23, 315 Mont. 395, 68 P.3d 768. In exercising its discretion, however, the trial court must abide by the Rules of Evidence or applicable statutes. As such, to the extent a district court\u2019s ruling is based on an interpretation of an evidentiary rule or statute, our review is de novo. <em>State v. Derbyshire, </em>2009 MT 27, \u00b6 19, 349 Mont. 114, 201 P.3d 811.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">\u00b613 <em>I. Whether the District Court erred by denying Lacey\u2019s motion to dismiss for a violation of his constitutional right to a speedy trial?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b61-8\">\u00b614 It hardly bears repeating that \u201c[a] criminal defendant\u2019s right to a speedy trial is guaranteed by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and by Article II, Section 24 of the Montana Constitution.\u201d Ariegwe, \u00b6 20. When confronted with a speedy trial claim, we consider the following four factors to determine if the defendant\u2019s constitutional right has been violated: (1) the length of the delay; (2) the reasons for the delay; (3) the accused\u2019s responses to the delay; and (4) the prejudice caused by delay to the accused. <em>See State v. Billman, </em>2008 MT 326, \u00b6 11, 346 Mont. 118, 194 P.3d 58 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>(summarizing the speedy trial test laid out in <em>Ariegwe).</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Under this test, no single factor is indispensible or dispositive. \u201cRather, the factors must be considered together with such other circumstances as may be relevant.\u201d <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 102.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">\u00b615 As the length of delay (3,472 days) is not in dispute, we first turn our attention to the second prong of the four-factor test-the reasons for the delay. Under this factor, the court identifies each period of delay in bringing the accused to trial and attributes each period of delay to the appropriate party. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 63-64. Here, while there are several distinct periods of delay, the primary area of contention is the 3,137-day delay between the issuance of the warrant and Lacey\u2019s arrest. Accordingly, we focus our analysis on that period.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">\u00b616 The District Court concluded that during the 3,137-day delay Lacey \u201cwas aware that he had been accused of wrongdoing in Montana and was actively seeking to avoid apprehension by law enforcement authorities.\u201d The District Court thus attributed the 3,137-day delay to Lacey. On appeal, Lacey contends that the District Court erred in finding that he was aware of the charges against him. He maintains that the \u201cevidence relied on by the court in finding that [he] knew of the charges ... falls short of the mark\u201d and that the District Court\u2019s conclusion that he absconded was in error. In the alternative, Lacey posits that even if the District Court properly found that he absconded, the court erred by failing to address the State\u2019s role in the 3,137-day delay. While we agree with Lacey that the District Court erred by failing to account for the State\u2019s actions under factor two, we conclude that the delay was, nevertheless, properly attributed to Lacey.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">\u00b617 \u201c \u2018[T]he primary burden\u2019 to assure that cases are brought to trial is \u2018on the courts and the prosecutors.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 72 (quoting Barker <em>v. Wingo, </em>407 U.S. 514, 529, 92 S. Ct. 2182, 2191 (1972)). \u201cA defendant has no duty to bring himself to trial; the State has that duty.\u201d <em>Barker, </em>407 U.S. at 527, 92 S. Ct. at 2190. Thus, the prosecution has the burden of explaining pretrial delays. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 64-65. We have held that \u201cnegligence (or lack of diligence) in bringing the accused to trial [is] an unacceptable reason for delay.\u201d <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 69. Accordingly, if an accused is outside of Montana\u2019s jurisdiction, \u201cthe State must act diligently and in good faith to acquire jurisdiction.\u201d <em>State v. Longhorn, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>2002 MT 135, \u00b6 22, 310 Mont. 172, 49 P.3d 48, <em>overruled on other grounds, Giambra v. Kelsey, </em>2007 MT 158, \u00b6 27, 338 Mont. 19, 162 P.3d 134.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\">\u00b618 On the other hand, if the defendant avoids being brought to trial, some or all responsibility for the delay should be attributed to him. Under factor two, the defendant and the State can both be attributed with, and share responsibility for, the same period of delay. <em>See e.g. State v. Morrisey, </em>2009 MT 201, \u00b6 66, 351 Mont. 144, 214 P.3d 708 (attributing responsibility for the delay equally between the defendant and the State). In short, the proper analysis under factor two requires addressing not only the reasons for the delay as they pertain to the defendant\u2019s actions but also whether the delay can be attributed to the State for failing to act diligently and in good faith to acquire jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">\u00b619 Here, the District Court only addressed one side of the equation. While we agree that Lacey\u2019s actions-including absence from his mother\u2019s funeral, failure to contest legal actions against his family\u2019s real property, failure to file state and federal income tax returns and moving to Mexico-all support the District Court\u2019s conclusion that Lacey intentionally avoided being brought to trial, the State could have been more diligent. The record indicates that the County Attorney sought and received a warrant for Lacey\u2019s arrest and that this warrant was entered into the NCIC database. It further indicates that the Montana authorities regularly re-validated this warrant and employed RMIN to search for Lacey. The evidence however, also demonstrates that the Gallatin County Sheriffs Office knew that Lacey was likely moving back and forth between California and Mexico. Despite this knowledge, there is nothing in the record indicating that either the Bozeman Police or the Gallatin County Sheriffs Office attempted, in response to this evidence, to contact California authorities or United States Border Patrol. While we are cognizant of the fact that, as Detective McLane testified, \u201cGallatin County alone has several thousand warrants outstanding as we sit here right now,\u201d the State should have, at the very least, contacted United States Border Patrol when the evidence clearly suggested that the accused was likely crossing the U.S./Mexico border on a regular basis. Nevertheless, despite the District Court\u2019s failure to address the State\u2019s diligence or lack thereof, we are satisfied that on balance, the evidence supports the District Court\u2019s ultimate conclusion that the reason for the delay should be attributed to Lacey. It is undisputed that Lacey knew there were rumors and allegations of his misconduct in Bozeman and, when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>taken as whole, this knowledge coupled with his actions over the course of those 3,137 days supports the conclusion that the delay was properly attributed to Lacey. That conclusion however, does not end the inquiry. We have emphasized that despite concluding that the reason for the delay should be attributed to the defendant, the \u201c \u2018courts must still engage in a difficult and sensitive balancing process\u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u2018this process must be carried out with full recognition that the accused\u2019s interest in a speedy trial is specifically affirmed in the Constitution.\u2019 \u201d Ariegwe, \u00b6 101 (quoting <em>Barker, </em>407 U.S. at 533, 92 S. Ct. at 2193). We thus turn our attention to the third factor in our speedy trial analysis-the accused\u2019s responses to the delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">\u00b620 In <em>Ariegwe </em>we explained that the court must evaluate the accused\u2019s responses to the delay and that \u201cthe totality of the accused\u2019s various responses to the delays in bringing him or her to trial ... is indicative of whether he or she actually wanted a speedy trial, which in turn informs the inquiry into whether there has been a deprivation of the right.\u201d <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 110. Put differently, this factor requires an examination of the accused\u2019s responses to the delay and a determination of whether those responses are consistent with a desire to have a speedy trial. If the accused\u2019s responses indicate that he or she did not desire a speedy trial, this factor weighs against finding a violation of the right and \u201cserves as a gauge of the weights the court should assign to the other three factors in the balancing.\u201d <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 110.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">\u00b621 Under this factor the District Court concluded that \u201c[t]he Court need not consider the accused\u2019s response to the delay where the accused himself is responsible for creating the delay.\u201d Lacey contends that since he filed his motion to dismiss \u201conly 220 days after he learned of the charges against him ... [t]his factor ... should weigh in [his] favor.\u201d The State on the other hand argues that, while the District Court\u2019s \u201canalysis of factor three was not as artfully crafted as what <em>Ariegwe </em>anticipated,\u201d the court properly concluded that Lacey \u201cdid not evidence a sincere desire to defend against the charges and go to trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AS\">\u00b622 At the outset, we note that the District Court\u2019s conclusion that it need not consider Lacey\u2019s responses to the delay because it concluded that Lacey was responsible for creating the delay misinterprets the balancing test laid out in <em>Ariegwe. </em>With regard to factor three, we have concluded that the court must evaluate \u201cthe totality of the accused\u2019s various responses to the delays in bringing him or her to trial ... together with the other three factors of the balancing test.\u201d <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 79. The District Court erred to the extent that it failed to specifically <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>address Lacey\u2019s \u201cacquiescence in and objections to pretrial delays.\u201d <em>Ariegwe,\u25a0 </em>\u00b6 79. This error is not grounds for reversal, however, because under the totality of Lacey\u2019s responses to the delays, we conclude that the balance tips against finding a deprivation of his constitutional right to a speedy trial. While Lacey\u2019s motion to dismiss was timely for the purposes of factor three analysis, his other responses, as discussed above, indicate that he did not actually want a speedy trial. Thus, we conclude that the totality of Lacey\u2019s responses to the delay supports weighing the other three factors against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-4\">\u00b623 Factor four requires an inquiry into whether the accused has been prejudiced by the delay. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 86. In making this inquiry, courts must address the interests that the speedy trial right is designed to protect-namely, (1) preventing oppressive pretrial incarceration; (2) minimizing anxiety and concern caused by the presence of unresolved criminal charges; and (3) limiting the possibility that the accused\u2019s ability to present an effective defense will be impaired. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 111. However, it is well-established that under certain circumstances, where the length of delay is great, the accused\u2019s burden of presenting affirmative evidence of prejudice is lessened. <em>See State v. Hardaway, </em>2009 MT 249, \u00b6 26, 351 Mont. 488, 213 P.3d 776.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">\u00b624 In this instance, the District Court examined each of the interests the speedy trial right is designed to protect and concluded that Lacey\u2019s claims of prejudice fail because the delay was the result of Lacey\u2019s own actions. On appeal, Lacey admits that he could show no direct prejudice to his defense, but contends that given the length of the delay and the State\u2019s negligence in causing it, prejudice should be presumed. The State counters that\u201c[s]ince Lacey himself admits there is no affirmative proof of prejudice, focusing on the other speedy trial factors in the instant case weighs in the State\u2019s favor rather than in Lacey\u2019s.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">\u00b625 Under the totality of the circumstances in this case, we agree with the District Court that Lacey\u2019s claims of prejudice fail. The primary reasons for the delay, other than the 182 days of institutional delay assigned to the State, were Lacey\u2019s actions including his constant movement, failure to file taxes or attend his mother\u2019s funeral, and the numerous other reasons discussed in our factor two analysis. This, coupled with the fact that Lacey can show no evidence of direct prejudice to his defense, supports the conclusion that Lacey has failed to show prejudice under factor four of our speedy trial claim analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"A9F\">\u00b626  While the right to a speedy trial is necessarily relative and depends upon the circumstances of the specific case, <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 104, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>we determine that here, the District Court properly denied Lacey\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of a speedy trial. On balance, the four factors weigh against finding a violation of the right to a speedy trial. We therefore affirm the District Court\u2019s denial of Lacey\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">\u00b627 <em>II. Whether the District Court erred by denying Lacey\u2019s motion in limine and allowing the State to present evidence that Lacey provided intoxicating substances and made sexual advances to young men other than the named victim.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">\u00b628 At the final pretrial conference the District Court denied Lacey\u2019s motion in limine explaining that it failed for two reasons: first, because it was untimely and second, because the evidence was admissible under the transaction rule. On appeal, Lacey argues that the District Court erred by denying his motion in limine and in allowing the State to present evidence that Lacey provided intoxicating substances and made sexual advances on young men other than J.G. Lacey maintains that his motion was timely and that evidence of his interactions with other young men was \u201cnot inextricably linked with the charged offenses\u201d so as to be admissible under the transaction rule. Lacey urges that the evidence that he allegedly engaged in \u201cother bad acts\u201d with other young men was highly prejudicial. He contends that since the State cannot show that there is no reasonable possibility this evidence did not contribute to his convictions, those convictions must be reversed. The State counters that the District Court properly denied Lacey\u2019s motion in limine and allowed evidence of his interactions with other young men to be presented. The State maintains that Lacey\u2019s motion was untimely and that, even assuming it was timely, the evidence presented was admissible pursuant to the transaction rule.</p>\n<p id=\"Ar\">\u00b629 The crux of the parties\u2019 dispute with regard to the timeliness of Lacey\u2019s motion is whether the District Court\u2019s order requiring that all motions \u201cshall be filed on or before June 13, 2008\u201d renders Lacey\u2019s October 1, 2008 motion untimely. The District Court reasoned that since all of the information regarding the contested evidence was available to Lacey prior to the June 13, 2008 motions deadline, his October 1, 2008 motion was untimely. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">\u00b630 The June 9, 2008 Omnibus Hearing Order clearly indicates that pursuant to M. R. Evid. 404, and \u00a7 46-13-109, MCA, the State did not intend to introduce evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts as part of their case against Lacey. Despite the fact that Lacey may have suspected the State intended to call these young men as witnesses, it is axiomatic that until a party is aware certain testimony is going to be offered, that party cannot object to the introduction of that evidence. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>Indeed, as Lacey points out, the motion itself \u201cwas arguably superfluous\u201d because \u201cLacey could have simply waited until the State began questioning the other two young men regarding those encounters and objected at that time.\u201d In light of the State\u2019s representation that it would not offer such evidence, it would be illogical and unfair to require that Lacey file a motion to exclude that evidence prior to it being offered. Therefore, the District Court\u2019s denial of Lacey\u2019s motion on timeliness grounds was error. We now turn to whether the motion was properly denied on substantive grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\">\u00b631 Under M. R. Evid. 404(b), \u201c[e]vidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith.\u201d Despite this prohibition we have held that where \u201c \u2018the declaration, act, or omission forms part of a transaction which is itself the fact in dispute or evidence of that fact, such declaration, act or omission is evidence as part of the transaction.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Crosley, </em>2009 MT 126, \u00b6 48, 350 Mont. 223, 206 P.3d 932 (quoting \u00a7 26-1-103, MCA). Pursuant to the transaction rule, evidence of other acts that are inextricably or inseparably linked to the charged offense is admissible notwithstanding the rules regarding other crimes or bad acts evidence. <em>State v. Buck, </em>2006 MT 81, \u00b6\u00b6 75-76, 331 Mont. 517, 134 P.3d 53.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">\u00b632  Here, evidence that Lacey plied other young men with intoxicating substances and made sexual advances on them may be similar to the circumstances of his conduct with J.G., but it is not inextricably linked to the offense for which Lacey was charged. The issue in dispute in the instant case is whether Lacey had sexual intercourse with J.G. without his consent. Evidence that he may have made sexual advances on other young men at other times does not tend to prove the operative facts at issue in the charged offense. As Lacey argues on appeal, \u201cthe State could explain that J.G. was intoxicated and that J.G. felt manipulated by Lacey all it wanted; it did not need to present the testimony of other young men regarding their separate encounters with Lacey in order to complete the story....\u201d The State\u2019s proffered evidence went to facts and addressed encounters that were completely separate from the sexual encounters for which Lacey was charged. In other words, for the purposes of the transaction rule, evidence of Lacey\u2019s \u201cother bad acts\u201d was not inextricably linked to the charged offense. The District Court erred in denying Lacey\u2019s motion in limine and allowing evidence that he provided intoxicating substances to and made sexual advances on young men other than J.G.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>\u00b633  Despite our conclusion that the District Court erred in allowing the State to present evidence of Lacey\u2019s interactions with other young men, it is well established that a \u201ccause may not be reversed by reason of any error committed by the trial court against the convicted person unless the record shows that the error was prejudicial.\u201d <em>Derbyshire, </em>\u00b6 43. Once the defendant establishes the evidence in question was erroneously admitted and has alleged prejudice demonstrating there is a reasonable possibility that the inadmissible evidence might have contributed to a conviction, it is incumbent on the State to prove the error was harmless. <em>State v. Van Kirk, </em>2001 MT 184, \u00b6 42, 306 Mont. 215, 32 P.3d 735. Here, Lacey has alleged that the evidence admitted in error prejudiced him by painting him as a \u201clecherous old man who was, at best, unfaithful to his lover, and at worst, a sexual predator.\u201d The State on the other hand has not even attempted to argue that the error was harmless. The State has failed to meet its burden and we hold that the District Court\u2019s error in admitting the \u201cother bad acts\u201d evidence was prejudicial and requires reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">\u00b634 Affirmed in part, reversed in part and remanded for a new trial in accordance with this decision.</p>\n<judges id=\"b68-5\">JUSTICES NELSON, COTTER and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b62-7\"> In <em>Doggett v. U.S., </em>505 U.S. 647, 112 S. Ct. 2686 (1992), the United States Supreme Court spelled out a similar four-factor speedy trial test. However, in resolving the case before us here, while we refer to federal court precedent, our decision today is based on the right to a speedy trial grounded in the Montana Constitution.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b68-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH,</author>\n<p id=\"Aoa\">specially concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">\u00b635 Regarding the admission of other acts evidence, I join the opinion of the Court. The transaction rule cannot be stretched to provide a vehicle for admission of the acts with other individuals in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"AuC\">\u00b636 However, had the prosecution provided proper notice pursuant to \u00a7 46-13-109, MCA, I would have voted to affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
