After several drinks, Benware threw a beer bottle at Miller and was evicted by the barkeep for disorderly behavior. Miller and Dumke remained at the bar but Dumke grew concerned about Benware and called to check on her. This conversation caused Dumke significant concern and at 9:51 p.m., she called the Kalispell Police Department (KPD), asking that they conduct a \u201cwelfare check\u201d on Benware. Dumke explained that Benware, a lawful gun owner, was \u201cplaying\u201d with her gun and was very upset. The KPD agreed to dispatch officers immediately. However, when Dumke told Miller she had called the KPD, Miller feared that Benware might lose her job at the Flathead County Sheriffs Department Animal Control Unit; therefore, at 10:06 p.m., Miller called the KPD dispatcher, identified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>herself as a probation and parole officer, and told the dispatcher that Dumke\u2019s call had been a prank and Benware was with them at the bar.</p>\n<p id=\"A4o\">\u00b67 Meanwhile, when an intoxicated Benware arrived home after being expelled from the bar, she took several prescription sleeping pills and then left in her car, intending to get a soft drink. As a result, she was not at home when the KPD arrived to check on her. While KPD officers were still at Benware\u2019s residence, dispatch called the officers and informed them that the requested welfare check had been a prank. The officers left Benware\u2019s home and suspended their efforts to find Benware. Unbeknownst to the officers, Miller, or Dumke at that time, Benware had had an automobile accident at approximately 9:54 p.m., which passersby had reported to the Flathead County Sheriffs Department. This accident occurred approximately 12 minutes before Miller told the KPD dispatcher that Benware was at the bar with her.</p>\n<p id=\"AZN\">\u00b68 On February 25, 2008, the City of Kalispell charged Miller with misdemeanor obstructing a peace officer based on Miller\u2019s untruthful claim that Dumke\u2019s call had been a hoax and that Benware was with them. A jury trial was held in June 2008, at the conclusion of which the jury convicted Miller of the charged offense. Miller appealed to the District Court arguing that the Trial Court erred in allowing multiple references to Miller\u2019s homosexuality into evidence and in allowing reference to Benware\u2019s automobile accident. She claimed that such evidence was irrelevant, without probative value, and highly prejudicial. She also asserted that the Trial Court abused its discretion in allowing Benware to be treated as a \u201chostile\u201d witness without a preliminary showing of hostility. The parties briefed the issues to the District Court, and on April 21, 2009, the District Court affirmed the Trial Court. Miller filed a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">\u00b69 Under Rule 15 of the Montana Uniform Municipal Court Rules of Appeal to District Court (UMCRApp), a district court\u2019s review of a municipal court\u2019s orders and judgment is limited to review of the record and questions of law. <em>State v. Bonamarte, </em>2009 MT 243, \u00b6 13, 351 Mont. 419, 213 P.3d 457 (citation omitted). This Court reviews a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether they are correct. <em>Bonamarte, </em>\u00b6 13. We review evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion. <em>Bonamarte, </em>\u00b6 13. A court abuses its discretion if it acts arbitrarily or unreasonably, and a substantial injustice results. <em>Bonamarte, </em>\u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">\u00b610 <em>Did the District Court err in affirming the Trial Court\u2019s admission of evidence pertaining to Miller\u2019s homosexuality?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">\u00b611 Miller maintains on appeal that the Trial Court erred in allowing repeated references to her homosexuality during the trial. Relying on <em>State v. Ford, </em>278 Mont. 353, 929 P.2d 245 (1996), and extra-jurisdictional cases, she claims her sexual orientation is unrelated to the elements of the charged crime and therefore it was irrelevant. She further opines that admission of this evidence was highly prejudicial, had no probative value, and constituted reversible error. Miller had suggested to the Trial Court during pretrial discussion of motions that the relationship between Miller and Benware be characterized as \u201cclose\u201d or \u201cbest\u201d friends to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">\u00b612 The City argued to the Trial Court that characterizing the women\u2019s relationship as anything other than what it was-an intimate homosexual relationship-was to lie and mislead the jury. It argued that knowledge that the women were intimate partners put both Benware\u2019s and Miller\u2019s conduct during that evening in context.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">\u00b613 The Trial Court denied Miller\u2019s pretrial motion to exclude evidence of homosexuality, noting that had Miller and Benware been a man and a woman, the nature of their relationship would be relevant and admissible. The District Court affirmed the Trial Court\u2019s ruling concluding that \u201c[t]he salient aspect of the evidence is the romantic nature of the relationship-not whether it was lesbian or heterosexual.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ASM\">\u00b614  While the Trial Court and the District Court equated homosexuality and heterosexuality for purposes of legal analysis, we conclude it was prejudicial error to do so under the circumstances presented here. Society does not yet view homosexuality or bisexuality in the same manner as it views heterosexuality. Because there remains strong potential that a juror will be prejudiced against a homosexual or bisexual individual, courts must safeguard against such potential prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">\u00b615 In <em>Ford, </em>Ford was charged with sexual intercourse without consent with another man. At trial, Ford testified that he was bisexual. The jury returned a guilty verdict and Ford appealed, in part, on grounds that the district court erroneously overruled his objections to the admissibility of evidence of his bisexuality. While we affirmed the district court in <em>Ford, </em>noting that Ford\u2019s sexuality \u201cwas relevant to, and probative of an essential issue in this case,\u201d we also cautioned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Asv\">There is, unquestionably, the potential for prejudice in this situation. There will be, on virtually every jury, people who would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>find the lifestyle and sexual preferences of a homosexual or bisexual person offensive.... [0]ur criminal justice system must take the necessary precautions to assure that people are convicted based on evidence of guilt, and not on the basis of some inflammatory personal trait. Therefore, we caution prosecutors and district courts not to assume, based on this opinion, that evidence of a defendant\u2019s sexual preference would be admissible under most circumstances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-4\"><em>Ford, </em>278 Mont. at 362, 929 P.2d at 250.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">\u00b616  Unlike the situation <em>in Ford, </em>where Ford\u2019s sexual orientation was squarely at issue, Miller\u2019s sexual orientation and the existence of an intimate relationship with Benware was not probative or relevant evidence vis-a-vis the crime with which Miller was charged. As Miller suggested before trial, if the State was concerned that the jury understand Miller\u2019s motive for calling off the KPD welfare check, it could have simply explained that the two women were good friends. There was no need to make repeated references throughout the trial to the homosexual nature of their relationship-either as an element of the crime or to establish context. As we noted in <em>Ford, </em>if there is no need for purposes of proof of a crime to introduce to the jury a potentially \u201cinflammatory personal trait,\u201d then it may well be error to do so. <em>Ford, </em>278 Mont. at 362, 929 P.2d at 250. Under the circumstances of this case, we conclude that introduction of the nature of the parties\u2019 sexual relationship was an abuse of the Trial Court\u2019s discretion. Therefore, we reverse the District Court on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">\u00b617 <em>Did the District Court err in affirming the Trial Court\u2019s admission of evidence of Benware\u2019s automobile accident on the night of the incident?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">\u00b618 Miller sought to exclude mention at trial of the automobile accident Benware had minutes before Miller told the KPD dispatcher that Benware was with her at the bar. Miller argued to the District Court and to this Court on appeal that the accident was not relevant to the criminal charge against her and that it prejudiced the jury against her. She asserts that because Benware\u2019s accident had already occurred by the time she spoke with the dispatcher, the two incidents were unrelated and mention of the accident had no probative value.</p>\n<p id=\"AKV\">\u00b619 The City counters that the accident establishes that Benware was a danger to herself that night; therefore, Dumke\u2019s call was neither a hoax nor unfounded. Kalispell submits that Miller\u2019s untruthful call obstructed the police from continuing to conduct a needed welfare check on Benware.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>\u00b620 Section 45-7-302(1), MCA, imposes criminal liability for obstructing an officer and states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-4\">A person commits the offense of obstructing a peace officer or public servant if the person knowingly obstructs, impairs, or hinders the enforcement of the criminal law, the preservation of the peace, or the performance of a governmental function, including service of process.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">\u201cKnowingly\u201d is defined in this context at \u00a7 45-2-101(35), MCA, as \u201cwhen the person is aware of the person\u2019s own conduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">\u00b621  It cannot be disputed that Miller \u201cknowingly\u201d placed the call to the KPD dispatcher and reported that Benware was fine and with her at the bar. It is reasonable to conclude from that call that Miller intended to mislead officers as to Benware\u2019s location and to prevent the officers from investigating Benware\u2019s whereabouts and condition. The evidence of Benware\u2019s automobile accident proves that Miller provided untruthful information to the KPD. Therefore, we cannot conclude that admission of this evidence was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"Ayl\">\u00b622 <em>Did the District Court err in concluding that the Trial Court did not abuse its discretion by allowing Benware to be treated as a hostile witness?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">\u00b623 Relying on <em>State v. Anderson, </em>211 Mont. 272, 686 P.2d 193 (1984), Miller argues that the Trial Court abused its discretion by granting the City\u2019s request, prior to Benware\u2019s testimony, to treat Benware as a \u201chostile\u201d witness under M. R. Evid. 611(c) (Rule 611(c)). She asserts that Benware was not hostile towards the City and reflected no hostility that would warrant allowing the prosecutor to ask Benware leading questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">\u00b624 The City counters that under Rule 611(c) it was authorized to ask leading questions because Benware, who testified that she was in a current relationship with Miller, was \u201ca witness identified with an adverse party.\u201d Rule 611(c) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-9\">Leading questions. Leading questions should not be used on the direct examination of a witness except as may be necessary to develop the witness\u2019 testimony. Ordinarily leading questions should be permitted on cross-examination. When a party calls a hostile witness, an adverse party, or a witness identified with an adverse party, interrogation may be by leading questions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-10\">\u00b625 In <em>Anderson, </em>Anderson was charged with 3 counts of sexual assault on 3 minor girls aged 9, 10, and 13. The 10-year old child was his stepdaughter, M. M had been listed as a prosecution witness but was not called by the prosecution at the trial. Anderson called her as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>a witness and requested that she be examined as a hostile witness. The State objected and the trial court denied the motion until M\u2019s testimony reflected hostility. M\u2019s testimony did not demonstrate hostility; rather, her testimony absolved Anderson. While the district court\u2019s ruling in <em>Anderson </em>is distinguishable from several other cases in which we have noted the well-known exception to the general provision against leading questions exists when the witness is a child <em>(see State v. Eiler, </em>234 Mont. 38, 46, 762 P.2d 210, 215 (1988) and <em>Bailey v. Bailey, </em>184 Mont. 418, 421, 603 P.2d 259, 261 (1979)), we held that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Anderson\u2019s motion until such time as M displayed hostility.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">\u00b626 Miller relies on this holding to support her argument. However, we conclude that <em>Anderson </em>is factually distinguishable and supports our ruling here. In <em>Anderson, </em>despite clear precedent that a demonstration of hostility was <em>not </em>required before a child witness could be interrogated with leading questions, we nonetheless acknowledged a trial court\u2019s broad discretion to issue such a ruling and deferred to it. We do so here as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">\u00b627 There is no question that Miller and Benware had a close association at the time of this trial however the relationship might have been characterized for the jury. Accordingly, under the text of the rule, interrogation by leading questions would be permitted because Benware was clearly \u201cidentified with an adverse party.\u201d While the better course on remand would be for the State to establish hostility on direct examination before seeking to treat Benware as hostile, we cannot conclude under the text of the rule that the court\u2019s preliminary ruling in this regard was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">\u00b628 For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the District Court\u2019s ruling which upheld the Trial Court\u2019s admission of evidence pertaining to Benware\u2019s automobile accident and the Trial Court\u2019s decision allowing Benware to be treated as a hostile witness. We conclude, however, that the District Court erred in affirming the Trial Court\u2019s admission of evidence of and repeated reference to Miller\u2019s homosexuality, and that a new trial is therefore warranted. Accordingly, we reverse and remand this matter to the District Court for further proceedings in accordance with this Opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b403-8\">JUSTICE WHEAT, LEAPHART and NELSON concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b403-9\">JUSTICE MORRIS</author>\n<p id=\"AWo\">dissents.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-10\">\u00b629 The Court overreaches in its search for prejudice and perpetuates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>the stereotypes from which it professes to protect Miller. I disagree with the Court\u2019s conclusion that the municipal court improperly admitted evidence of Miller\u2019s intimate relationship with Benware. The State\u2019s allegedly prejudicial remarks emphasized the intimate nature of the relationship between Miller and Benware in order to demonstrate that Miller had a motive to make the call in order to protect Benware. The State\u2019s characterization of the relationship did not emphasize its same sex nature. The State instead focused on the length and intimacy of the relationship between Miller and Benware.</p>\n<p id=\"ApD\">\u00b630 The State argued that the long-term intimate nature of the relationship between Miller and Benware proved qualitatively different than a mere friendship to demonstrate Miller\u2019s motive to protect Benware. The Court appears to concede that evidence regarding the nature of the relationship would have been relevant and admissible had the relationship been a heterosexual one. \u00b6 14. Yet the Court concludes that such evidence should have been inadmissible here solely because it concerned a same sex relationship. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">\u00b631 Miller used <em>voir dire </em>in an effort to uncover any potential for prejudice arising from Miller\u2019s sexual orientation and her relationship with Benware. Miller\u2019s counsel questioned the jury exhaustively about same sex relationships and the potential for prejudice against a lesbian defendant. Miller\u2019s counsel failed to unearth any potential prejudice during <em>voir dire. </em>I would not assume that any unspoken prejudice among the potential jurors rose to the level of a potential juror being more likely to convict Miller for misdemeanor obstruction of a peace officer due to the fact that Miller and Benware had established an intimate relationship for thirteen years. I dissent from the Court\u2019s conclusion that these limited remarks tainted the jury to the point of depriving Miller of a fair trial.</p>\n<judges id=\"b404-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH and JUSTICE RICE join in the foregoing dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
