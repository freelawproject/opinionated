We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-9\">\u00b62 We address the following issue on appeal: Whether the District Court erred in denying Walter\u2019s Motion to Intervene.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-10\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b343-11\">\u00b63 Holly and Walter entered into a Dissolution Agreement on February 11, 2002, in Gallatin County, Montana, wherein Walter agreed to pay Holly $6,000 per month in spousal maintenance until her death. The agreement also stipulated that if Holly shared a residence for more than six months with someone with whom she was having an intimate relationship, the amount would be reduced by $2,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-12\">\u00b64 Holly and Joseph were married on August 17, 2008, and the following month, Walter stopped paying spousal maintenance to Holly. On April 16, 2009, Holly filed a petition in Park County, Montana, to have her marriage to Joseph declared invalid based upon her allegation that she had been fraudulently induced to enter into the marriage. Walter sought to intervene in the proceedings asserting that the entry of a retroactive decree of invalidity could affect his obligation to make maintenance payments to Holly.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-13\">\u00b65 The Park County District Court denied Walter\u2019s Motion to Intervene and subsequently entered its Findings of Fact, Conclusions of law and Decree of Invalidity declaring Holly\u2019s and Joseph\u2019s marriage invalid \u201ceffective as of the date of the parties\u2019 marriage.\u201d Walter appeals the District Court\u2019s denial of his Motion to Intervene.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-14\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b343-15\">\u00b66 Under M. R. Civ. P. 24, intervention may be either as a matter of right or by permission of the court. Our review of a district court\u2019s grant or denial of a motion to intervene as a matter of right under M. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>R. Civ. P. 24(a) is de novo. <em>See In re Adoption of C.C.L.B., </em>2001 MT 66, \u00b6 16, 305 Mont. 22, 22 P.3d 646 (whether the party seeking intervention has made a prima facie showing of an interest in the proceedings is a conclusion of law which we review for correctness). On the other hand, we review a district court\u2019s grant or denial of a motion for permissive intervention pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 24(b), for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Connell v. Dept. of Social and Rehab. Serv., </em>2003 MT 361, \u00b6 13, 319 Mont. 69, 81 P.3d 1279. In addition, we review the timeliness of a motion under either M. R. Civ. P. 24(a) (intervention as a matter of right) or M. R. Civ. P. 24(b) (permissive intervention) for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Estate of Schwenke v. Becktold, 252 </em>Mont. 127, 131-32, 827 P.2d 808, 811 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">\u00b67 <em>Whether the District Court erred in denying Walter\u2019s Motion to Intervene.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">\u00b68 Walter moved to intervene in Holly\u2019s and Joseph\u2019s invalidity proceedings pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 24(a), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-7\">Intervention of right. Upon timely application anyone shall be permitted to intervene in an action: (1) when a statute confers an unconditional right to intervene; or (2) when the applicant claims an interest relating to the property or transaction which is the subject of the action and the applicant is so situated that the disposition of the action may as a practical matter impair or impede the applicant\u2019s ability to protect that interest, unless the applicant\u2019s interest is adequately represented by existing parties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AbU\">Walter argued in the court below and now on appeal that he had a direct interest in the invalidity proceedings because the reason Holly sought an annulment rather than a divorce from Joseph was so that she could again receive maintenance payments from Walter. On that basis, Walter contends that he should have been permitted to argue that Holly and Joseph had not satisfied the requirements for obtaining an annulment or, in the alternative, that the annulment should not have been retroactive.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">\u00b69 In prior decisions before this Court, we have observed that M. R. Civ. P. 24 \u201cis a discretionary, judicial efficiency rule. It is used to avoid delay, circuity and multiplicity of actions.\u201d <em>In re Marriage of Glass, </em>215 Mont. 248, 253, 697 P.2d 96, 99 (1985) (citing <em>Grenfell v. Duffy, </em>198 Mont. 90, 95, 643 P.2d 1184, 1187 (1982)). We have also stated that in order to intervene as a matter of right under M. R. Civ. P. 24(a), an applicant must satisfy the following four criteria: (1) the application <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>must be timely; (2) it must show an interest in the subject matter of the action; (3) it must show that the protection of that interest may be impaired by the disposition of the action; and (4) it must show that that interest is not adequately represented by an existing party. <em>Estate of Schwenke, </em>252 Mont. at 131, 827 P.2d at 811 (citing 3B Moore\u2019s Federal Practice, \u00b6 24.07[1], at 24-50 (2d ed. <em>1987); Keith v. Daley, </em>764 F.2d 1265, 1268 (7th Cir. 1985), <em>cert denied, </em>474 U.S. 980, 106 S. Ct. 383 (1985)).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">\u00b610 Walter argues that he has satisfied each of the requirements for intervention, thus the District Court erred in denying his Motion to Intervene. Holly and Joseph filed separate briefs in response to Walter\u2019s appeal. While Joseph, in his brief, agrees that Walter\u2019s motion was timely filed and that neither Joseph nor Holly are representing Walter\u2019s interests, Joseph argues that Walter has not met the other two requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">\u00b611 Both Holly and Joseph point out that Walter should not be allowed to intervene because only Holly and Joseph could litigate the validity of their marriage. Nevertheless, Holly spends a majority of her brief addressing M. R. Civ. P. 24(b) regarding permissive intervention. But, as already indicated in this Opinion, Walter moved to intervene as a matter of right under M. R. Civ. P. 24(a), not for permissive intervention under M. R. Civ. P. 24(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">\u00b612 Joseph, on the other hand, arguing under M. R. Civ. P. 24(a), maintains that Walter does not have an interest in the subject matter of the invalidity proceedings. Rather, Joseph argues that Walter has the right and the ability to have his claim fully adjudicated in the court that originally addressed Holly\u2019s and Walter\u2019s dissolution action and which has continuing jurisdiction to revisit that action when circumstances between the two change. We agree. Whether Walter\u2019s maintenance obligation to Holly terminated upon her remarriage was not an issue before the District Court, nor is it a question before this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">\u00b613 A party seeking intervention as a matter of right \u201cmust make a prima facie showing of a direct, substantial, legally-protectable interest in the proceedings\u201d as a \u201cmere claim of interest is insufficient to support intervention as a matter of right.\u201d <em>Adoption of C.C.L.B., </em>\u00b6 16 (citing <em>Devoe v. State, </em>281 Mont. 356, 363, 935 P.2d 256, 260 (1997); <em>Aniballi v. Aniballi, </em>255 Mont. 384, 386-87, 842 P.2d 342, 343-44 (1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">\u00b614 Both Holly and Joseph cite to <em>In re Marriage of Heidema, </em>2007 MT 20, 335 Mont. 362, 152 P.3d 112, as support for their arguments that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>the District Court did not err in denying Walter\u2019s Motion to Intervene. While <em>Heidema </em>involves a dissolution proceeding rather than an invalidity proceeding, our decision in that case is instructive.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">\u00b615 Douglas Faw was injured while employed as a ranch hand for brothers Jack and John Heidema in the Heidemas\u2019 ranch operations. The Heidemas did not have workers\u2019 compensation insurance coverage and Faw\u2019s medical expenses as a result of his injuries exceeded $1,000,000. Faw filed suit against the Heidemas and the Heidema Partnership for negligence and for failure to provide workers\u2019 compensation coverage. Subsequently, Jack\u2019s wife, Sydne, filed a petition for dissolution of their marriage. Faw attempted to intervene in the divorce action asserting that the divorce was being sought only to protect Sydne\u2019s interest in the marital estate against Faw\u2019s pending lawsuits. <em>Heidema, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 3-4.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">\u00b616 In his motion to intervene, Faw asserted that he was entitled to intervene as a matter of right because he had an interest relating to property in the marital estate and that distribution of the marital estate would impede or impair his ability to protect his interests. <em>Heidema, </em>\u00b6 10. He further asserted that his interests were not protected by the parties to the dissolution action. <em>Heidema, </em>\u00b6 10. The District Court granted Faw\u2019s motion stating that the timing of the dissolution petition warranted permissive intervention in order for the court to adequately address Faw\u2019s interests. <em>Heidema, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 5, 10. However, after Jack and Sydne entered into a settlement agreement, the court entered a final decree of dissolution over Faw\u2019s objections. <em>Heidema, </em>\u00b6 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">\u00b617 On appeal, we questioned whether the District Court should have allowed Faw to intervene in the dissolution action in the first place because Faw had not made a prima facie showing of an actual interest in the Heidema\u2019s property, and because Faw had other avenues available to him for protecting his alleged interest in the property. <em>Heidema, </em>\u00b6 11 (citing M. R. Civ. P. 24(a)(2); <em>Aniballi, </em>255 Mont. at 386-87, 842 P.2d at 343-44). We pointed out in <em>Heidema </em>that the only proper parties in a dissolution proceeding are the spouses seeking to be divorced, <em>Heidema, </em>\u00b6 13, thus we held that because Faw was not a party to the marriage, he had no standing to assert that the marriage was or was not irretrievably broken, <em>Heidema, </em>\u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">\u00b618  Similar to our observation in <em>Heidema </em>that the only proper parties to the dissolution proceeding in that case were the husband and wife, we conclude that the only proper parties to the invalidity proceeding in the instant case are Holly and Joseph. Walter has failed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>to demonstrate that he has <em>\u201ca </em>direct, substantial, legally-protectable interest\u201d in the invalidity proceedings. <em>See Adoption of C.C.L.B., </em>\u00b6 16. Any adjudication of Walter\u2019s maintenance obligation should be addressed by the Gallatin County District Court that entered the Decree of Dissolution in Holly\u2019s and Walter\u2019s divorce action. That court is the proper forum to consider Walter\u2019s arguments that he no longer has a maintenance obligation to Holly as that court has continuing jurisdiction to resolve the issue Walter raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">\u00b619  Because we conclude that Walter has not established a direct, substantial, legally-protectable interest in the invalidity proceedings, we hold that the District Court correctly concluded that Walter does not have a sufficient claim of interest to intervene as a matter of right in the invalidity proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">\u00b620 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b347-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES WHEAT, MORRIS and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
