Two young children were passengers in the minivan. Both the pickup and the minivan sustained damage and had to be towed from the scene. Both the woman in the minivan and the driver of the third vehicle complained of neck pain after the collision. The children were unharmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-10\">\u00b64 Police officers arriving at the scene of the collision spoke with G\u2019Stohl and reported that he slurred his words and was difficult to understand. They also described his breath as boozy, his eyes glossy, and his walk unsteady. G\u2019Stohl admitted to having a few drinks at a bar before driving home. The officers arrested G\u2019Stohl and ferried him to the Yellowstone County Detention Center, where G\u2019Stohl refused to submit to sobriety tests or a breathalyzer. G\u2019Stohl did agree to recite the alphabet, which he accomplished without trouble.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-11\">\u00b65 The State charged G\u2019Stohl with criminal endangerment and driving under the influence (DUI). G\u2019Stohl moved to dismiss the former charge on the basis that the criminal endangerment statute, \u00a7 45-2-207, MCA, is unconstitutionally vague as applied to his case. The District Court denied the motion, reasoning that G\u2019Stohl had not shown the statute to be unconstitutional as applied to him. Subsequently and pursuant to a plea agreement, G\u2019Stohl pleaded no contest to criminal endangerment and guilty to DUI, reserving his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>right to appeal the denial of the motion to dismiss. For criminal endangerment, the District Court sentenced G\u2019Stohl to a five-year commitment to the Department of Corrections with three years suspended. For DUI, G\u2019Stohl was sentenced to six months in jail with all but a day suspended. The District Court ordered the sentences to run concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-4\">\u00b66 G\u2019Stohl now appeals the District Court\u2019s order denying his motion to dismiss. G\u2019Stohl argues that he was \u201cnever given notice or put on notice of what conduct was prohibited\u201d and that \u00a7 45-2-207, MCA, does not contain sufficient guidelines to prevent arbitrary enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">\u00b67 This Court reviews a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to dismiss de novo. <em>State v. Samples, </em>2008 MT 416, \u00b6 13, 347 Mont. 292, 198 P.3d 803. Our review of constitutional questions is plenary. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 14. The party challenging a statute carries the heavy burden of demonstrating the statute\u2019s unconstitutionality. <em>Hernandez v. Bd. of Co. Commrs., </em>2008 MT 251, \u00b6 15, 345 Mont. 1, 189 P.3d 638.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">\u00b68 <em>Whether the District Court erred in holding that \u00a745-2-207, MCA, is not unconstitutionally vague as applied to G\u2019Stohl.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b71-9\">\u00b69  A law that is so vague that it leaves ordinary people uncertain as to what conduct it prohibits or that it may authorize or encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement is repugnant to the Due Process Clauses of the Constitutions of Montana and the United States. Mont. Const, art. II, \u00a7 17; U.S. Const, amend. XTV, \u00a7 1; <em>Samples, </em>\u00b6 16; <em>GiaCcio v. Pennsylvania, </em>382 U.S. 399, 402-03, 86 S. Ct. 518, 520-21 (1966). The void-for-vagueness doctrine is premised on the principle that everyone is entitled to fair warning of what the law commands and forbids so he may conduct himself accordingly and the related principle that explicit legal standards are necessary to prevent policemen, prosecutors, judges, and juries from enforcing the law in arbitrary or discriminatory fashion. <em>State v. Stanko, </em>1998 MT 321, \u00b6 23, 292 Mont. 192, 974 P.2d 1132.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-10\">\u00b610 A statute is so vague as to deny due process of law if (1) the statute fails to give \u201ca person of ordinary intelligence fair notice that [the person\u2019s] contemplated conduct is forbidden\u201d or (2) it fails to establish \u201cminimal guidelines to govern law enforcement.\u201d <em>State v. Dixon, </em>2000 MT 82, \u00b6\u00b6 28, 30, 299 Mont. 165, 998 P.2d 544. When a defendant mounts an as-applied vagueness challenge to a statute, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>G\u2019Stohl does here, our evaluation of the first criterion examines <em>f </em>conduct with which the defendant is charged in order to detero&amp;, whether the defendant could have reasonably understood that A. conduct was proscribed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 28. Similarly, in an as-appli6fc challenge, our evaluation of the second criterion may include whether a defendant\u2019s conduct so \u201cclearly falls within the proscriptions of the ... charge\u201d that the enforcement could not be the result of unfettered discretion. <em>See id. </em>at \u00b6 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">\u00b611 Section 45-5-207, MCA, which G\u2019Stohl here challenges as unconstitutionally vague as applied to him, reads in relevant part: \u201cA person who knowingly engages in conduct that creates a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to another commits the offense of criminal endangerment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">\u00b612 G\u2019Stohl argues that \u00a7 45-5-207, MCA, is unconstitutionally vague both because it did not give him actual notice that his conduct-driving while sufficiently intoxicated that he crashed his pickup into an occupied vehicle, disabling both vehicles-amounted to criminal endangerment and because it encouraged arbitrary enforcement by the arresting officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">\u00b613 G\u2019Stohl first argues that \u201che was never given notice or put on notice of what conduct was prohibited by the statute,\u201d so he could not have \u201cknowingly engaged\u201d in the proscribed conduct. G\u2019Stohl supports this argument by distinguishing his case from <em>State v. Smaage, </em>276 Mont. 94, 915 P.2d 192 (1996). In <em>Smaage </em>the defendant was convicted of knowing endangerment under \u00a7 45-5-207, MCA, for driving erratically through the streets of Helena with a blood-alcohol content of .250. <em>Id. </em>at 96, 915 P.2d at 193. The defendant, Smaage, had previously been charged six times for DUI, had been convicted at least five times for DUI, had pleaded guilty to negligent homicide for the death of a passenger in a car he wrecked, and had been warned by a judge that his drinking and driving was going to harm others. <em>Id. </em>at 96, 98, 915 P.2d at 193, 195. On appeal, the Court rejected the defendant\u2019s as-applied vagueness challenge to \u00a7 45-5-207, MCA, reasoning: \u201cWith his history of convictions of DUI and negligent homicide, Smaage should reasonably have understood that his drunk driving created a substantial risk of serious bodily injury to others and was therefore proscribed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 99, 915 P.2d at 195-96. Unlike <em>Smaage, </em>G\u2019Stohl advances, he has no history of DUI, has never been admonished by a judge that drinking and driving is dangerous to others, did not have an \u201cextremely high\u201d blood-alcohol content, and was not seen swerving toward other cars.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>4 G\u2019Stohl\u2019s arguments lack merit. First, to the degree that G\u2019Stohl serts that due process required him to have \u201cactual notice\u201d of the 'ohibition of \u00a7 45-5-207, MCA, before he could be prosecuted (in the ense that he had to be aware of the existence of the statute), he is mistaken. While this Court stated in <em>Dixon </em>that the first criterion of the void-for-vagueness analysis involves \u201cactual notice,\u201d we subsequently clarified that the determinative inquiry was \u201cwhether the statute gives a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice that [the person\u2019s] contemplated conduct is forbidden.\u201d <em>Dixon, </em>\u00b6 28. \u201cIn any event, people are presumed to know the law.\u201d <em>Cole v. St. ex rel. Brown, </em>2002 MT 32, \u00b6 28, 308 Mont. 265, 42 P.3d 760. Whether or not a defendant is, in fact, aware of the existence of a given law has no bearing on our analysis of an as-applied challenge to a statute on the grounds of vagueness.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\">\u00b615 Furthermore, G\u2019Stohl\u2019s efforts to distinguish <em>Smaage </em>are unavailing. Here, the uncontested evidence indicates that G\u2019Stohl was significantly impaired at the time of the collision: his speech was slurred, his gaze glassy-eyed, his breath boozy, and his walk unsteady. Contrary to G\u2019Stohl\u2019s suggestion, a person need not have a history of DUI convictions or admonishments from judges to understand that drinking to excess and then crashing one\u2019s pickup into an occupied vehicle with sufficient force to disable both vehicles \u201ccreates a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to another.\u201d Additionally, we have no basis on which to compare G\u2019Stohl\u2019s blood-alcohol content to that of the defendant in <em>Smaage </em>because G\u2019Stohl refused to submit to a breathalyzer test. Finally, while there is no indication that G\u2019Stohl was swerving through traffic like the defendant in <em>Smaage, </em>G\u2019Stohl, unlike the defendant in <em>Smaage, </em>actually collided with an occupied vehicle, causing a multiple-vehicle accident, injuring other parties involved, and requiring vehicles to be towed. Thus, we reject G\u2019Stohl\u2019s argument that \u00a7 45-5-207, MCA, as applied to the facts of this case, failed to give fair notice that G\u2019Stohl\u2019s conduct was proscribed.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">\u00b616 G\u2019Stohl\u2019s second argument-that \u00a7 45-5-207, MCA, lacks minimal guidelines to prevent arbitrary enforcement-consists of three conclusory and desultory statements. First, G\u2019Stohl states that the ambiguity of the statute permitted arbitrary enforcement. Second, G\u2019Stohl advances that the arresting officer arbitrarily charged him with criminal endangerment because he was \u201clikely perturbed at G\u2019Stohl\u2019s refusal to admit to the offense and refusal to submit to any breath or sobriety tests.\u201d Third, G\u2019Stohl contends that the statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>encourages arbitrary enforcement because \"nearly every person* charged or convicted of a DUI offense . . . could also be charged and convicted of criminal endangerment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">\u00b617  We find these arguments unpersuasive. G\u2019Stohl\u2019s first argument-that the statute is ambiguous-fails to point out any language in the text of the statute that is ambiguous. Without further analysis by G\u2019Stohl, this argument cannot succeed. <em>See Johansen v. State, </em>1998 MT 51, \u00b6 26, 288 Mont. 39, 955 P.2d 653 (explaining that the Court\u2019s office is not to \u201cdevelop legal analysis that may lend support to [a given] position\u201d). G\u2019Stohl\u2019s second argument-that the arresting officers arbitrarily charged him with criminal endangerment because he refused to cooperate-is sheer conjecture and also unlikely given that G\u2019Stohl\u2019s conduct (driving while drunk and crashing his pickup into another occupied vehicle, disabling both vehicles) plainly \u201cfalls within the proscriptionD\u201d of the criminal endangerment charge. <em>See Dixon, </em>\u00b6 34. Finally, G\u2019Stohl\u2019s unsupported argument that nearly every person charged with DUI could also be charged with criminal endangerment echoes an argument raised by the defendant in <em>Dixon. </em>In that case, the defendant raised an as-applied vagueness challenge to \u00a7 45-8-335, MCA (possession of explosives), arguing that the offense was \u201ccompletely subsumed within ... \u00a7 45-8-333, MCA [reckless or malicious use of explosives].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 25. We rejected the argument, observing that the defendant \u201ccites no legal authority for the proposition that because a defendant could have also been charged with a lesser offense, the statute he was charged with violating is therefore unconstitutionally vague as applied.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6\u00b6 34-35. The same reasoning applies here, and accordingly we reject G\u2019Stohl\u2019s third argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">\u00b618 Finding no merit in the arguments G\u2019Stohl has raised to challenge the constitutionality of \u00a7 45-5-207, MCA, we conclude that G\u2019Stohl has not carried his burden of demonstrating that \u00a7 45-5-207, MCA, is unconstitutional. We therefore affirm the ruling of the District Court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b74-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES NELSON, COTTER and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
