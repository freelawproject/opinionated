We affirm. \u00b62 Energy West presents five issues on appeal, which we restate as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b270-8\">\u00b63 <em>1. Did the District Court err in denying Energy West\u2019s motions for summary judgment and directed verdict regarding Tacke\u2019s status as an exempt employee for purposes of overtime compensation under the FLSA?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b270-9\">\u00b64 <em>2. Did the District Court err in awarding liquidated damages to Tacke?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b270-10\">\u00b65 3. <em>Did the District Court err in awarding attorneys\u2019 fees to Tacke without requiring Tacke\u2019s counsel to provide contemporaneous time records?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b270-11\">\u00b66 <em>4. Did the District Court err in awarding costs pursuant to FLSA instead of the Montana costs statute ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b270-12\">\u00b67 <em>5. Did the District Court err in admitting Tacke\u2019s exhibits 2, 3, 4, and 13 over Energy West\u2019s objections?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b270-13\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b270-14\">\u00b68 Tacke began work for Energy West in 1970 and held various positions within the company during her more than thirty-year career. Tacke filed suit against Energy West to recover overtime wages she claimed she had earned between September 15, 2002, and July 15, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">\u00b69 During those years, Tacke worked as the Supervisor of the Credit and Collection Department, a position for which she received a salary and was classified by Energy West as an exempt employee. Tacke\u2019s exempt classification meant she was not entitled to receive overtime wages in addition to her salary.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">\u00b610 In 2004, Tacke and other Energy West employees attended a wage and hour seminar in Billings. The seminar spurred several management employees to question Tacke\u2019s classification as an exempt employee. Energy West\u2019s Human Resources Department advised Kurt Baltrusch, Director of Operations and Tacke\u2019s direct supervisor, of the potential error, and Baltrusch investigated the matter further.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">\u00b611 Baltrusch testified that he sought advice from John Allen, who was both corporate counsel and the Human Resources Officer for Energy West. Allen instructed Baltrusch to ask Tacke to prepare a written list of her duties. Allen also provided Baltrusch a checklist to aid in determining whether Tacke should be classified as an exempt or non-exempt employee. Tacke provided a listing of her duties and the percentage of her time expended on each duty. After reviewing the list, Baltrusch testified that he again spoke with Allen and, although testimony was unclear about whether the two relied upon either the \u201cexecutive\u201d or \u201cadministrative\u201d exemption set forth in law, both agreed that Energy West should reclassify Tacke as a non-exempt employee entitled to receive overtime compensation. Baltrusch testified he also spoke with others about the issue, including Energy West CEO David Cerotzke. Cerotzke initially disputed Baltrusch\u2019s conclusion but eventually allowed Baltrusch to reclassify Tacke as non-exempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">\u00b612 On June 30,2005, Baltrusch wrote a letter to Tacke informing her that Energy West was reclassifying her as non-exempt. The letter provided, in relevant part: \u201cFor some time there has been a question on your employment status, that is whether you are exempt or nonexempt for overtime. From my standpoint, you are a non-exempt employee and must be paid when you work extra hours, that is, over 40 hours each week.\u201d Tacke testified that she discussed the details of the letter with Baltrusch and Allen, but that the issue of past uncompensated overtime was not resolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">\u00b613 Tacke filed suit against Energy West in September 2005 in the Eighth Judicial District Court to recover claimed overtime compensation. After Tacke filed suit, Energy West reversed its decision to classify her as non-exempt, returning her to exempt status.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-9\">\u00b614 The District Court denied cross-motions for summary judgment, and the case proceeded to a jury trial. On November 14,2008, the jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>returned a special verdict in favor of Tacke for $35,220.00 in uncompensated overtime wages. The jury did not, however, find that Tacke proved by a preponderance of the evidence that Energy West\u2019s failure to pay overtime was willful.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">\u00b615 The District Court entered a judgment on January 15, 2009, awarding Tacke $35,220.00 for uncompensated overtime wages, an additional $35,220.00 in liquidated damages, and $4,958.73 in costs. On July 21, 2009, the District Court awarded Tacke an additional $4,372.10 in expert witness fees, $1,147.10 for travel expenses for Attorney Howard Strause, and attorneys\u2019 fees of $95,737.50 for Strause and $90,675.00 for Elizabeth Best. Tacke obtained a total final judgment against Energy West for $267,330.43. Energy West appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">\u00b616 We review the District Court\u2019s denial of motions for summary judgment and directed verdict <em>de novo. Tucker v. Farmers Ins. </em>Exch., 2009 MT 247, \u00b6 23, 351 Mont. 448, 215 P.3d 1 (citation omitted); <em>McKay v. Wilderness Dev., LLC, </em>2009 MT 410, \u00b6 26, 353 Mont. 471,221 P.3d 1184 (citation omitted). When considering a summary judgment motion, a court may not \u201cmake findings of fact, weigh the evidence, choose one disputed fact over another, or assess the credibility of witnesses.\u201d <em>Andersen v. Schenk, </em>2009 MT 399, \u00b6 2, 353 Mont. 424, 220 P.3d 657. The court may only \u201cexamine[] the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, admissions on file, and affidavits to determine whether there is a genuine issue as to any material fact relating to the legal issues raised and, if there is not, whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the undisputed facts.\u201d Andersen, \u00b6 2 (citing M. R. Civ. P. 56(c); <em>Corporate Air v. Edwards Jet Ctr., </em>2008 MT 283, \u00b6 28, 345 Mont. 336, 190 P.3d 1111). Similarly, a motion for a directed verdict is \u201cproper only when there is a complete absence of any evidence to warrant submission to a jury.\u201d <em>Ryan v. City of Bozeman, </em>279 Mont. 507, 510, 928 P.2d 228, 229-30 (1996) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">\u00b617 We review the District Court\u2019s award of attorneys\u2019 fees, costs, and evidentiary rulings for an abuse of discretion. <em>In re Marriage of Cameron, </em>2009 MT 302, \u00b6 17, 352 Mont. 375, 217 P.3d 78 (citation omitted); <em>Ritchie v.

Evenflo </em>Co., 2009 MT 285, \u00b6 29, 352, Mont. 325, 217 P.3d 514 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b272-9\">\u00b618 <em>1. Did the District Court err in denying Energy West\u2019s motions for </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number><em>summary judgment and directed verdict regarding Tacke\u2019s status as an exempt employee for purposes of overtime compensation under the FLSA?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">\u00b619 Energy West argues Tacke provided no facts establishing that she fell outside the administrative exemption to the FLSA and the District Court therefore erred in denying its motions for summary judgment and directed verdict. Tacke counters that she indeed presented evidence that her work did not qualify for the administrative exemption and that Energy West failed to show, as a matter of law, that she fit within the administrative exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">\u00b620 In 1938, Congress passed the FLSA \u201cto prevent the use of unfair trade practices in interstate commerce leading to \u2018labor conditions detrimental to the maintenance of the minimum standard of living necessary for health, efficiency, and general well-being of workers ....\u2019\u201d <em>Stewart v. Region II Child and Family Servs., </em>242 Mont. 88, 94, 788 P.2d 913, 917 (1990) (citation omitted). The FLSA requires employers to pay employees overtime compensation for hours worked in excess of forty hours per week. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 207(a)(1). The FLSA provides exemptions for certain executive and administrative employees, but employers bear the burden of proving that the employee fits \u201cplainly and unmistakably within the exemption\u2019s terms.\u201d <em>Mont. Public Employee\u2019s Assoc. v. Mont. Dept. of Transp., </em>1998 MT 17, \u00b6 11, 287 Mont. 229, 954 P.2d 21 (citing <em>Spradling v. City of Tulsa, </em>95 F.3d 1492, 1495 (10th Cir. 1996); <em>Aaron v. City of Wichita, </em>54 F.3d 652, 657 (10th Cir. 1995); <em>Reich v. Wyo., </em>993 F.2d 739, 741 (10th Cir. 1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">\u00b621 The administrative exemption relied upon by Energy West applies if three elements exist.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> First, the employee must be \u201cCompensated on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455.00 per week ... exclusive of board, lodging, or other facilities.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.200(a)(1). Second, the employee\u2019s \u201cprimary duty\u201d must be \u201cthe performance of office or non-manual work directly related to the management or general business operations of the employer or the employer\u2019s customers.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.200(a)(2). \u201cTo meet this requirement, an employee must perform work directly related to assisting with the running or servicing of the business ....\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.201(a). Third, the employee\u2019s \u201cprimary duty\u201d must include \u201cthe exercise of discretion and independent judgment with respect to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>matters of significance.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.200(a)(3). Such discretion or independent judgment must be \u201cmore than the use of skill in applying well-established techniques, procedures or specific standards described in manuals or other sources.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.202(e). To aid in applying these three elements, the regulations provide examples of positions that qualify for the administrative exemption. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.203; <em>see also </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.703(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">\u00b622 Applying these regulations to the evidence in the record leads us to conclude that the District Court did not err in denying summary judgment and a directed verdict to Energy West. We need look no further than Tacke\u2019s own testimony about her typical work day. At 6:00 a.m., Tacke began by printing notices for Energy West customers whose accounts were delinquent. The computer generated the list of notices, and the printing generally took Tacke two hours to complete. Around 8:00 a.m., Tacke would help cashiers open the mail and post payments to ensure Energy West did not shut off gas to a customer who had just paid a delinquent account. From 9:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m., Tacke returned to printing notices for delinquent accounts until completed. For the rest of the morning, Tacke took \u201cphone calls and payments from customers\u201d and also called customers to arrange for Energy West to access inside meters. During the lunch hour and other break periods, Tacke filled in for the switchboard operator. For the rest of the afternoon, Tacke took additional phone calls from customers who wanted to pay on their past due accounts, entered customer payments on the computer system, and ensured Energy West had access to inside meters. According to Tacke, she addressed customer issues with the Public Service Commission less than once a month. She operated exclusively within Energy West\u2019s policies and manuals, and, similar to other employees, was authorized to \u201cwrite off balances that people owe on their bills\u201d of up to only $50.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">\u00b623  This testimony, taken as true, establishes that Tacke did not meet the requisite elements, set forth above, for an administratively exempt employee. Although contested by Energy West, this evidence was nonetheless sufficient to raise genuine issues of material fact about whether Tacke qualified for the administrative exemption. See <em>Andersen, </em>\u00b6 2 (A court has no authority to \u201cmake findings of fact, weigh the evidence, choose one disputed fact over another, or assess the credibility of witnesses\u201d at the summary judgment stage.) Neither was there \u201ca complete absence of any evidence to warrant submission to a jury\u201d necessitating a directed verdict. <em>Ryan, </em>279 Mont. at 510, 928 P.2d at 229-30 (citation omitted). We affirm the District Court\u2019s denial of Energy West\u2019s motions for summary judgment and directed verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>\u00b624 <em>2. Did the District Court err in awarding liquidated damages to Tacke?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">\u00b625 We review an award of liquidated damages under the FLSA utilizing multiple standards of review, although we have not previously stated them comprehensively. First, concerning the determination that an employer has or has not acted in good faith and on reasonable grounds, a district court\u2019s factual findings are reviewed for clear error and legal conclusions are reviewed <em>de novo </em>for correctness. <em>Tefft </em>v. <em>Mont., </em>271 Mont. 82, 91-92, 894 P.2d 317, 323 (1995); <em>see also Rodriguez v. Farm Stores </em>Grocery, <em>Inc., </em>518 F.3d 1259, 1272 (11th Cir. 2008) (citing 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 260). Then, if an employer has established good faith and reasonable grounds, we review the ultimate decision concerning an award of liquidated damages for an abuse of discretion. <em>Tefft, </em>271 Mont. at 93, 894 P.2d at 324; <em>Rodriguez, </em>518 F.3d at 1272.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">\u00b626 Energy West first argues that because the jury found it did not act willfully in withholding overtime compensation from Tacke, the District Court was prohibited from awarding liquidated damages. Tacke responds that, while she did not satisfy her burden of proving Energy West acted willfully, Energy West likewise failed to meet its burden of proving it acted in good faith and on reasonable grounds-an entirely different question.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">\u00b627  The FLSA provides that if an employer withholds overtime compensation in violation of 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 207(a)(1), the employer \u201cshall be liable to the employee or employees affected in the amount of ... their unpaid overtime compensation ... <em>and in an additional equal amount as liquidated damages.\u201d </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 216(b) (emphasis added). However they may be perceived, liquidated damages are not for the purpose of punishing the employer, but for compensating employees \u201cfor any losses caused by delayed receipt of overtime wages they are due.\u201d <em>Martin v. Cooper Elec. Supply Co., </em>940 F.2d 896, 910 (3d Cir. 1991) (citation omitted). To avoid liquidated damages, an employer must first demonstrate that his actions were \u201cin good faith and that he had reasonable grounds for believing that his act or omission was not a violation of the [FLSA] ....\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 260; <em>see also </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a7 790.22.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">\u00b628 The employer bears a \u201csubstantial burden\u201d in demonstrating good faith and reasonable grounds. <em>Renfro v. City of Emporia, </em>948 F.2d 1529, 1540 (10th Cir. 1991) (citation omitted); <em>Marshall v. Brunner, </em>668 F.2d 748,753 (3d Cir. 1982). \u201cGood faith\u201d exists when the employer has \u201can honest intention to ascertain and follow the dictates of the <em>Act.\u201dRenfro, </em>948 F.2d at 1540 (citationomitted). \u201cReasonable grounds\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>is an objective standard by which to evaluate the employer\u2019s behavior. <em>Renfro, </em>948 F.2d at 1540 (citation omitted). Prior to a showing of good faith and reasonable grounds, \u201cthe district court has <em>no discretion </em>to mitigate an employer\u2019s statutory liability for liquidated damages.\u201d <em>Marshall, </em>668 F.2d at 753 (emphasis added, citation omitted). Only after the employer carries its burden may a district court, \u201cin its sound discretion, award no liquidated damages or award any amount thereof not to exceed the amount specified in section 216 of this title.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 260.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">\u00b629 We thus reject Energy West\u2019s suggestion that, because it did not act willfully, <em>ipso facto </em>it acted in good faith and on reasonable grounds. The question of willfulness determines the length of the statute of limitations. In \u201ca cause of action arising out of a willful violation,\u201d instead of a two-year statute of limitations, the employee is entitled to a three-year statute of limitations. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 255(a). To gain the additional year, the burden is on the <em>employee </em>to show the employer\u2019s actions were willful, meaning \u201cdeliberate,\u201d \u201cintentional,\u201d or that \u201cthe employer either knew or showed reckless disregard for the matter of whether its conduct was prohibited.\u201d <em>McLaughlin v. Richland Shoe Co., </em>486 U.S. 128, 133, 135, 108 S. Ct. 1677, 1681, 1682 (1988). Here, the jury determined this standard had not been met, and Tacke was therefore entitled to the two-year statutory period. This determination, however, is an entirely different question than whether the employer acted in good faith and upon reasonable grounds. <em>See Rodriguez, </em>518 F.3d at 1274. The <em>employer </em>bears the burden of demonstrating the good faith and reasonable grounds necessary to avoid an award of liquidated damages, and it is noteworthy that, in addition to being described as a \u201csubstantial burden,\u201d courts have stated that an employer\u2019s ability to escape liquidated damages is the exception, not the rule. <em>Walton v. United Consumers Club, Inc., </em>786 F.2d 303, 310 (7th Cir. 1986) (recognizing \u201c[djouble damages are the norm, single damages the exception\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">\u00b630  Even if the employer carries this burden, the district court \u201cmay still award liquidated damages at its discretion in any amount up to that allowed by 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 216(b).\u201d <em>Mireles v. Frio Foods, Inc., </em>899 F.2d 1407, 1416 n. 8 (5th Cir. 1990) (citing <em>McClanahan v. Mathews, </em>440 F.2d 320, 323 (6th Cir. 1971); <em>Martinez v. Food City, Inc., </em>658 F.2d 369, 376 (5th Cir. Unit A 1981)). \u201c[I]f the employer shows to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>satisfaction of the court that the act or omission giving rise to such action was in good faith and that he had reasonable grounds ..., the court <em>may, in its sound discretion, </em>award no liquidated damages or award any amount thereof not to exceed the amount specified in section 216 of this title.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 260 (emphasis added). Because Congress used the permissive word \u201cmay\u201d instead of \u201cshall,\u201d the District Court had no affirmative obligation to strike or reduce the liquidated damages award against Energy West. In light of the facts in this record, we conclude that the District Court was well within its discretion to decline to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">\u00b631 <em>3. Did the District Court err in awarding attorneys\u2019 fees to Tacke without requiring Tacke\u2019s counsel to provide contemporaneous time records?</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">\u00b632 FLSA provides that \u201c[t]he court in such action shall ... allow a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee to be paid by the [employer] ....\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 216(b). To determine the attorneys\u2019 fees, courts use the \u201clodestar\u201d method, which consists of \u201c[multiplying the number of hours reasonably spent on the case by an appropriate hourly rate in the community for such work.\u201d <em>Saizan v. Delta Concrete Prods. Co., </em>448 F.3d 795, 799 (5th Cir. 2006) (per curiam) (citation omitted); <em>see also Laudert v. Richland Co. Sheriffs Dept., </em>2001MT 287, \u00b6 14, 307 Mont. 403, 38 P.3d 790. The lodestar method \u201cis <em>presumed </em>to be the reasonable fee to which counsel is entitled.\u201d <em>Penn. v. Del. Valley Citizens\u2019 Council for Clean Air, </em>478 U.S. 546, 564, 106 S. Ct. 3088, 3098 (1986) (quoting <em>Blum v. Stenson, </em>465 U.S. 886, 897, 104 S. Ct. 1541, 1548 (1984)) (emphasis in original, quotations omitted); <em>Laudert, </em>\u00b6 17 (citation omitted). The party seeking the fees bears the burden of showing the \u201creasonableness of the hours billed.\u201d <em>Saizan, </em>448 F.3d at 799. Reasonable fees do not include fees that were \u201cunproductive, excessive, or redundant,\u201d and the fee claimant must establish reasonableness by the presentation of evidence. <em>Saizan, </em>448 F.3d at 799 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">\u00b633 Energy West argues the District Court erred in awarding attorneys\u2019 fees because Tacke failed to submit contemporaneous time records detailing her counsel\u2019s work on the matter. Tacke rebuts Energy West\u2019s argument, first, by arguing Energy West neither requested the production of billing documentation nor produced its own number of hours worked on the case. However, it was not Energy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>West which was seeking a fee award. It was Tacke\u2019s burden, not Energy West\u2019s, to provide evidence demonstrating that her claimed attorneys\u2019 fees were reasonable. To hold otherwise would shift Tacke\u2019s burden to Energy West.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">\u00b634 Tacke then argues, as she did in the District Court, that she was not required to provide contemporaneous billing records and that her evidence was sufficient to carry her burden. The evidence Tacke submitted to the District Court consisted of two affidavits containing a total of seven sentences, expert deposition testimony, and testimony from Tacke\u2019s counsel. This evidence was long on opinion, but short on detail about the purpose of the hours claimed by the lawyers. The District Court concluded that the evidence, when coupled with its personal knowledge of the case, validated \u201cthe hours that have been submitted here are in fact reasonable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">\u00b635 However, unlike a district court, an appellate court lacks personal observation and involvement in a case that can be called upon when considering an attorneys\u2019 fees award. Without detailed evidence about the hours spent, we are left to assessing counsel\u2019s conclusory statements about lack of duplication or reasonableness on their face, or comparing contrary expert opinion. Appropriate appellate review is thereby hindered, and for this reason appellate courts nationally have required production of contemporaneous billing records, speaking with much frustration about the issue. The Second Circuit admonished plaintiffs\u2019 counsel in a similar, fee-shifting circumstance:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-6\">In light of the difficulties that can be traced to the failure of plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys to keep contemporaneous time records, we are tempted to accept the State\u2019s proposal that plaintiffs be denied all attorney\u2019s fees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-7\">[T]he difficulties raised by the lack of contemporaneous records in this case convince us of the need to announce for the future that contemporaneous time records are a prerequisite for attorney\u2019s fees in this Circuit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b278-8\"><em>N.Y. State Assoc. for Retarded Children, Inc. v. Carey, </em>711 F.2d 1136, 1147 (2d Cir. 1983) (analyzing award of reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988). We are similarly \u201ctempted\u201d in this case. Other courts have likewise expressed these concerns. <em>See e.g. Natl. Assoc. of Concerned Vets. v. Sec. of Def., </em>675 F.2d 1319, 1327 (D.C. Cir. 1982); <em>Grendel\u2019s Den, Inc. v. Larkin, </em>749 F.2d 945, 952 (1st Cir. 1984); <em>In re Hudson &amp; Manhattan </em>R.R., 339 F.2d 114, 115 (2d Cir. 1964); <em>Sussman v. Patterson, </em>108 F.3d 1206, 1212 (10th Cir. 1997); <em>Hensley v. Eckerhart, </em>461 U.S. 424, 433, 103 S. Ct. 1933, 1939 (1983) (\u201cWhere the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>documentation of hours is inadequate, the district court may reduce the award accordingly.\u201d); <em>Erickson v. City of Topeka, </em>239 F. Supp. 2d 1202, 1206 (D. Kan. 2002) (\u201cTo satisfy the burden of proving a reasonable fee, counsel must keep contemporaneous and detailed records of time ....\u201d) (citation omitted); <em>Bergeson v. Dilworth, </em>875 F. Supp. 733, 737 (D. Kan. 1995) (production of time records required when attorneys work on a contingent fee basis).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\">\u00b636 Tacke further argues that even if she wanted to produce the billing records, both the attorney-client privilege and work-product doctrine preclude her from doing so. In asserting the attorney-client privilege, Tacke cites to <em>Clarke v. American Commerce Natl. Bank, </em>974 F.2d 127 (9th Cir. 1992). However, assuming <em>Clarke </em>applies, it does not support a blanket prohibition on providing billing records. There, the American Commerce National Bank (ACNB) allegedly paid the personal legal expenses for its chairman. <em>Clarke, </em>974 F.2d at 128. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency investigated the matter further, and eventually issued an administrative subpoena to ACNB for the production of billing statements from outside legal counsel. <em>Clarke, </em>974 F.2d at 128. ACNB asserted the attorney-client privilege, and after reviewing the records, the Ninth Circuit concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-5\">[The billing statements] do not contain privileged communications between attorney and client. The statements contain information on the identity of the client, the case name for which payment was made, the amount of the fee, and the general nature of the services performed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-6\"><em>Clarke, </em>974 F.2d at 130. While <em>Clarke </em>protects records \u201cwhich also reveal the motive of the client in seeking representation, litigation strategy, or the specific nature of the services provided,\u201d it does not support a blanket prohibition on the use of billing statements. <em>Clarke, </em>974 F.2d at 129. In-camera review by the district courts, accompanied with the use of redaction when necessary, will accommodate the need for such records in order to demonstrate the reasonableness of fee awards in fee-shifting cases while also protecting the attorney-client privilege. <em>See e.g. Huether v. Dist. Ct. of the Sixteenth Jud. Dist., </em>2000 MT 158, \u00b6 22, 300 Mont. 212, 4 P.3d 1193.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">\u00b637 Equally unpersuasive is Tacke\u2019s argument that the work-product doctrine also prohibits the use of billing statements to support an attorneys\u2019 fees claim. The work-product doctrine, as delineated in M. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(3), \u201cis broader in application than the attorney-client privilege, but it is not an absolute privilege.\u201d <em>Kuiper v. Dist. Ct. of the Eighth Jud. Dist., </em>193 Mont. 452, 462, 632 P.2d 694, 700 (1981). To interpret the doctrine as imposing a blanket prohibition on the use of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>administrative records, such as time and billing documents, stretches the privilege too far. As generally noted, \u201cthe work product rule cannot be invoked by an attorney in connection with an affirmative claim for recovery of attorney\u2019s fees to avoid a discovery inquiry concerning possible apportionment of fees among compensable and noncompensable claims.\u201d 23 Am. Jur. 2d <em>Depositions and Discovery </em>\u00a7 45 (2002) (citing <em>Martin v. </em>Paunovich, 632 So. 2d 611 (Fla. 5th Dist. App. 1993)); <em>see also First Union Natl. Bank of S.C. v. Soden, </em>511 S.E.2d 372, 380 (S.C. App. 1998) (analyzing billing statement as not falling within work product). To the extent billing records may contain \u201cordinary work product\u201d or \u201copinion work product,\u201d the records are, again, subject to redaction of such information. <em>See e.g. Palmer by Diacon v. Farmers Ins. Exch., </em>261 Mont. 91, 115, 118, 861 P.2d 895, 910, 912 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">\u00b638  The District Court conducted a careful review of the fee issue and we conclude that it exercised conscientious judgment and did not clearly err in evaluating the evidence or abuse its discretion in approving the fee award. However, while we do not adopt a per se rule as some courts have done, we strongly urge counsel to keep and provide contemporaneous time records in support of attorneys\u2019 fees requests in fee-shifting cases, and we encourage district courts to look askance at requests not so supported.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">\u00b639 <em>4. Did the District Court err in awarding costs pursuant to FLSA instead of the Montana costs statute ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">\u00b640 Energy West argues the District Court erred by awarding costs beyond those allowed under \u00a7 25-10-201, MCA, which it argues is controlling. Tacke responds that costs in this case should be awarded pursuant to 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 216(b), not \u00a7 25-10-201, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">\u00b641 Tacke brought this case under FLSA, which provides that \u201c[t]he court in such action shall, in addition to any judgment awarded to the plaintiff or plaintiffs, allow a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee to be paid by the defendant, and costs of the action.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 216(b). Montana\u2019s cost statute allows the following costs:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-8\">(1) the legal fees of witnesses, including mileage, or referees and other officers;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-9\">(2) the expenses of taking depositions;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-10\">(3) the legal fees for publication when publication is directed;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-11\">(4) the legal fees paid for filing and recording papers and certified copies of papers necessarily used in the action or on the trial;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-12\">(5) the legal fees paid stenographers for per diem or for copies;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-13\">(6) the reasonable expenses of printing papers for a hearing when required by a rule of court;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>(7) the reasonable expenses of making transcript for the supreme court;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-4\">(8) the reasonable expenses for making a map or maps if required and necessary to be used on trial or hearing; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-5\">(9) other reasonable and necessary expenses that are taxable according to the course and practice of the court or by express provision of law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">Section 25-10-201, MCA. Energy West challenges the District Court\u2019s award of costs for mediation fees, legal research, copies, postage, and the construction and synchronization of a deposition, arguing they exceed the costs allowed by \u00a7 25-10-201, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">\u00b642 When determining which statute to apply, we are to use the particular over the general. Section 1-3-225, MCA. Our decision in <em>Kuhr v. City of Billings, </em>2007 MT 201, 338 Mont. 402, 168 P.3d 615, provides helpful guidance. In <em>Ruhr, </em>the employees pursued a wage claim under the state statutory scheme. <em>Kuhr, </em>\u00b6 8. The parties argued whether costs should be awarded under the general costs statute or pursuant to \u00a7 39-3-214, MCA, of the wage claim statutes. <em>Kuhr, </em>\u00b6 35. We reasoned that <em>\u201ca </em>more specialized statute\u201d may require its application instead of the general costs statute. <em>Kuhr, </em>\u00b6 37. We concluded that \u201c[t]his is a wage claim case specifically covered by a more specialized statute,\u201d and applied \u00a7 39-3-214, MCA, the statute awarding costs in wage claims, instead of the general costs statute, \u00a7 25-10-201, MCA. <em>Ruhr, </em>\u00b6 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">\u00b643 Similar to <em>Ruhr, </em>FLSA\u2019s cost provision is more specific and should control over Montana\u2019s general costs statute. To effectuate FLSA\u2019s policies, \u201cCongress has permitted individual employees to sue for back wages and liquidated damages and to receive reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs.\u201d <em>Barrentine v. Arkansas-Best Freight System, Inc., </em>450 U.S. 728, 740 n. 16, 101 S. Ct. 1437, 1444 n. 16 (citing 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 216(b)). In keeping with the purpose of FLSA and our logic in <em>Ruhr, </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 216(b) should govern instead of \u00a7 25-10-201, MCA.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Al\">\u00b644 <em>5. Did the District Court err in admitting Tacke\u2019s exhibits 2, 3, 4, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number><em>and 13 over Energy West\u2019s objections?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">\u00b645 Energy West argues that Tacke\u2019s exhibits of 2, 3, 4, and 13 were irrelevant, confusing, and should have been excluded. Tacke responds that these exhibits were relevant because they allowed the jury to compare her classification and duties when classified as non-exempt with her duties when classified as exempt. Tacke further argues that Energy West did not raise the proper objection for exhibits 2 and 4. \u00b646 Relevant evidence includes \u201cevidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d M. R. Evid. 401. The exhibits at issue are three job descriptions which were not generated during the 2002 to 2005 time period at issue, and a letter dated October 29, 1990, informing Tacke that she was classified as non-exempt and must report her overtime.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">\u00b647 After reviewing the record, we believe Energy West properly raised a relevance objection, but conclude the District Court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the exhibits. While we see Energy West\u2019s concern about relevance, the admitted exhibits, though covering a different time period when Tacke was paid as an hourly employee, provided the jury with additional information about Energy West\u2019s classification and reclassification of Tacke\u2019s position and whether Energy West had acted willfully.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">\u00b648 Even if relevant, evidence may be excluded if it has the propensity to confuse the issue or mislead the jury. M. R. Evid. 403. Here, the District Court required Tacke to lay additional foundation about the exhibits and Energy West had the opportunity through cross-examination, case-in-chief, and closing arguments to clarify any potential confusion that the exhibits caused.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">\u00b649 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b282-8\">JUSTICES LEAPHART, MORRIS, COTTER and NELSON concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b273-7\"> In 2004 the U.S. Department of Labor reorganized and clarified the regulations addressing the administrative exemption, but, for purposes of the analysis in this case, the substantive content of the regulations remained the same.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b276-6\"> The parties here agreed that whether Energy West acted in good faith and on reasonable grounds was a determination to be made by the court, not the jury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b277-7\"> Energy West does not challenge the District Court\u2019s conclusion that a fee rate of $225 per hour was reasonable or its calculation of the lodestar amount.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b281-9\"> Our holding is limited by Energy West\u2019s narrow argument that the District Court erred in awarding costs beyond those allowed under \u00a7 25-10-201, MCA.
