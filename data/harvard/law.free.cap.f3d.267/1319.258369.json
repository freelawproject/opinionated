United States, </em>No. 98-145C, slip op. at 11 (Fed.Cl. Jan. 11, 2000). In light of this court\u2019s opinion in <em>PCA Health Plans of Texas, Inc. v. LaChance, </em>191 F.3d 1353 (Fed.Cir.1999), addressing similar contract provisions under similar circumstances, and this court\u2019s interpretation of Qualmed\u2019s contract, this court reverses.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"AQzj\">On January 1, 1986, Qualmed entered into a contract with the United States Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to provide health benefits to federal employees. Under that contract, Qualmed offered a comprehensive medical plan. The contract incorporated or restated regulations from the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) and Federal Employees Health Benefit Acquisitions Regulations (FEHBAR). Those regulations governed Qualmed\u2019s pricing for its medical plan coverage and also any instance where Qualmed overcharged the Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-11\">For instance, section 3.3 of Qualmed\u2019s contract, which restates FEHBAR \u00a7 1652.215-70, entitled \u201cRate Reduction for Defective Pricing or Defective Cost or Pricing Data\u201d, states:</p>\n<p id=\"b924-12\">If any rate established in connection with this contract was increased because (1) the Carrier furnished cost or pricing data that were not complete, accurate, or current ... (2) the Carrier furnished pricing data that were not accurate as represented on the Claim for Exemption from Submission of Certified Cost or Pricing Data (SF 1412); (3) the Carrier developed FEHBP rates with a rating methodology and structure inconsistent with that used to develop rates for similarly sized subscriber groups [SSSG] ... or (4) the Carrier furnished data or information of any description that were not complete, accurate, and current\u2014 then the rate shall be reduced in the amount by which the price was increased because of the defective data or information.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-13\">Section 5.9, which restates FAR \u00a7 52.215-23 (1991), entitled \u201cPrice Reduction for Defective Cost or Pricing Data\u2014 Modifications,\u201d states:</p>\n<p id=\"b925-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1321\">*1321</page-number>(a) [T]his clause does not apply to any modification for which the price is</p>\n<p id=\"b925-4\">(2) Based on established catalog or market prices of commercial items sold in substantial quantities to the general public.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-5\">(b) <em>If any price ... or any cost reimbursable under this contract, was increased by any significant amount because (1) the Contractor ... famished cost or pricing data that were not complete, accurate, and current ... </em>the price or cost shall be reduced accordingly and the contract shall be modified to reflect the reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-6\">&gt;;&lt; &gt;j\u00ed ^ <em>%</em></p>\n<p id=\"b925-7\">(e) <em>If any reduction in the contract price under this clause reduces the price of items </em>for which payment was made prior to the date of the modification reflecting the price reduction, <em>the Contractor shall be liable </em>and shall pay the United States at the time such overpayment is repaid\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b925-8\">(1) <em>Simple interest on the amount of such overpayment to be computed from the date(s) of overpayment </em>to the Contractor to the date the Government is repaid by the Contractor. ...</p>\n<p id=\"b925-9\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b925-10\">Section 5.34, which restates FAR \u00a7 52.232-17 (1991), states:</p>\n<p id=\"b925-11\">(a) <em>[AJll amounts, except amounts that are repayable and which bear interest under a Price Reduction for Defective Cost or Pricing Data clause [section 5.9], </em>that become payable by the Contractor to the Government under this contract ... <em>shall bear simple interest from the date due until paid unless paid within 30 days of becoming </em>due____</p>\n<p id=\"b925-14\">(b) Amounts shall be due at the earliest of the following dates:</p>\n<p id=\"b925-15\">(1) The date fixed under this contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-16\">(2) The date of the first written demand ....</p>\n<p id=\"b925-17\">(3) The date the Government transmits ... a proposed supplemental agreement to confirm completed negotiations ....</p>\n<p id=\"b925-18\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"A_Oo\">In other words, section 5.9 of the contract permits the recovery of interest from the date of overpayment, 1991 and 1992 in this case. Section 5.34, on the other hand, only permits the recovery of interest from the date of first written demand for the amount, and only if the amount due is not paid within 30 days of that demand. Section 3.3 reduces the contract rates themselves by the amount the price increased because of defective data or information.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-20\">According to Qualmed, its plan calculated the charged rates based on a two-step process. First, the plan selected two \u201csimilarly sized subscriber groups\u201d (SSSGs), which were converted from per member/per month capitation to separate \u201cself\u2019 or \u201cfamily\u201d rates, i.e., to the \u201cbase rate.\u201d Second, the plan modified the base rate to account for variables between the Government and the SSSGs, including benefit levels (loading) and demographic information. After modification, this rate became the \u201csubscription rate,\u201d or the rate charged to the Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-21\">OPM\u2019s Office of the Inspector General (OIG) performed an audit of Qualmed\u2019s operations for the years 1988-1992. In its Final Audit Report, the OIG found, <em>inter alia, </em>that the plan selected Public Service Company (PSC) and Honeywell as its SSSGs in 1991, and Intel and Honeywell as its SSSGs in 1992. The OIG determined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1322\">*1322</page-number>Qualmed did not accurately select SSSGs for 1991 and 1992. Specifically, Qualmed should have selected Los Alamos National Labs instead of Honeywell in 1991, and Los Alamos and PSC instead of Honeywell and Intel in 1992. Los Alamos and PSC were more accurate SSSGs in both 1991 and 1992 because those entities were arithmetically closer in size to the Federal Employees\u2019 Health Benefit Program (FEHBP). Because Qualmed incorrectly chose SSSGs, OPM determined that Qualmed overcharged for its medical coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-4\">After the audit, Qualmed and OPM settled the dispute regarding reimbursements for the overpayment. Qualmed reimbursed to OPM the principal amount of overpayment within 30 days of reaching the settlement. The settlement, however, did not resolve the question of whether the Government was also entitled to recover interest from the date of overpayment, rather than from 30 days after the date of first written demand for the amount \u2014 the date of the settlement agreement. Thus, in February 1998, Qualmed filed a complaint in the Court of Federal Claims seeking a declaratory judgment that OPM was not entitled to interest on the overpay-ments. OPM filed a counterclaim seeking interest from Qualmed in the amount of $311,689,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> as determined by the contracting officer, plus additional interest. Both parties filed motions for summary judgment. While those motions were pending, this court decided <em>PCA Health Plans of Texas, Inc. v. LaChance, </em>191 F.3d 1353 (Fed.Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b926-5\">To the Court of Federal Claims, Qualmed argued that the two separate steps of calculating rates under the plan established a legal distinction between \u201cdefective community rating and defective pricing\u201d and \u201cdefective cost or pricing data\u201d under section 5.9. In other words, according to Qualmed, the selection of incorrect SSSGs amounted to \u201cdefective pricing\u201d \u2014 an activity not covered by section 5.9. Qualmed observed that selection of SSSGs is part of the initial step of setting a base-line market price. Thus, Qualmed argued, \u201cdefective cost or pricing data\u201d could not encompass the incorrect selection of SSSGs because \u201cdefective cost or pricing data\u201d under section 5.9 was only possible during the second step of converting the base market price into the final rate through FEHBP-specific adjustments, i.e., only after the SSSGs had been selected.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-10\">Based on its interpretation of the 1987 Federal Register (52 Fed.Reg. 16032 (May 1, 1987)), the Court of Federal Claims accepted Qualmed\u2019s proffered distinction between \u201cdefective community rating and defective pricing\u201d and \u201cdefective cost or pricing data.\u201d Specifically, the Court of Federal Claims noted that the Federal Register stated that FAR 52.215-23 (section 5.9) applied to loadings and demographic rate adjustments. The Federal Register did not expressly mention that the selection of SSSGs was also subject to this section. The Court of Federal Claims determined that \u201c[t]his omission leads to the inference that selection of SSSGs are not included within the regulation.\u201d <em>Qualmed Plans, </em>No. 98-145C, slip op. at 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-11\">In addition, according to the Court of Federal Claims, both the Board of Contract Appeals (BCA) and the Federal Circuit holdings in <em>PCA Health Plans </em>implicitly accepted this distinction because those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1323\">*1323</page-number>opinions did not address this \u201cunderlying factual issue.\u201d Id. at 8-9. The Court of Federal Claims then determined that the overpayment in 1991 and 1992 was based solely on Qualmed\u2019s selection of the wrong SSSGs, which was not covered by section 5.9. Instead, the Court of Federal Claims concluded that that overpayment was covered by section 5.34. Because Qualmed reimbursed OPM\u2019s overpayment within 30 days of the Government\u2019s first written demand via the settlement agreement, the Court of Federal Claims concluded that the Government was not entitled to any interest under section 5.34 for the years 1991 and 1992. Consequently, the Court of Federal Claims granted Qualmed\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The Government appealed. This court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(3) (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b927-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-5\">The Federal Circuit reviews a grant of summary judgment by the Court of Federal Claims without deference. <em>Cook v. United States, </em>86 F.3d 1095, 1097 (Fed.Cir.1996). Contract interpretation is also subject to review without deference. <em>Hughes Communications Galaxy, Inc. v. United States, </em>998 F.2d 953, 957 (Fed.Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b927-6\">In its summary judgment denying the Government interest for the overpayment under section 5.9 of the contract, the Court of Federal Claims declined to apply this court\u2019s decision in <em>PCA Health Plans. </em>The relevant facts in <em>PCA Health Plans, </em>however, are strikingly similar to this case. In <em>PCA Health Plans, </em>the OIG\u2019s audit report determined that PCA engaged in defective pricing because PCA incorrectly picked Abbott Labs and Motorola, rather than Travis County and the University of Texas, as SSSGs in 1991. <em>Appeal of PCA Health Plans of Texas, Inc., </em>No. 48,711, slip op. at 10,19 (A.S.B.C.A. June 24,1998) <em>(Appeal of PCA Health Plans). </em>PCA argued that OPM\u2019s 1991 claim concerned \u201crating methodology\u201d rather than \u201cdefective cost or pricing data.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b927-8\">In its initial decision, the BCA found that PCA could not escape the application of section 5.9(e) based on its argument that OPM\u2019s claim concerned bad \u201cmethodology,\u201d not \u201cdefective pricing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 23. Because PCA identified two significantly underrated groups as its SSSGs, the Board found that OPM\u2019s claim concerned the furnishing of \u201cinaccurate data.\u201d On appeal, this court affirmed, stating:</p>\n<p id=\"b927-9\">The board, crediting the OPM Office of Inspector General\u2019s audit of PCA, found that \u201cOPM\u2019s claim ... does not concern rating \u2018methodology,\u2019 but furnishing to OPM of \u2018inaccurate data.\u2019 \u201d We will not disturb the board\u2019s factual determination \u201cunless the decision is fraudulent, or arbitrary, or capricious____\u201d PCA presents no evidence that such a finding is warranted here. Thus, its submission of defective pricing data implicates the interest payment mandate of section 5.9(e)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b927-11\"><em>PCA Health Plans, </em>191 F.3d at 1356. This court therefore affirmed the Board\u2019s grant of summary judgment that PCA owed interest from the date of the overpayment.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-12\">In response to the above-quoted language, Qualmed asserts that this court simply affirmed a \u201cfactual determination\u201d in <em>PCA Health Plans. </em>Thus, according to Qualmed, that factual aspect of the prior case does not bind this case. As mentioned previously, however, the relevant facts in <em>PCA Health Plans </em>are nearly identical to those in this case. Namely, both PCA and Qualmed incorrectly picked underrated SSSGs, thereby causing them to overcharge for their medical coverage plan. In this case, the OIG clearly stated that Qualmed picked an incorrect SSSG in 1991, and two incorrect SSSGs in 1992, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1324\">*1324</page-number>even if it did pick one correct SSSG in 1991. As in <em>PCA Health Plans, </em>Qualmed\u2019s selection of incorrect SSSGs caused the overpayment. Moreover, Qualmed now relies on a \u201crating methodology\u201d versus \u201cdefective cost or pricing data\u201d argument \u2014 the same argument rejected by this court in <em>PCA Health Plans.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b928-4\">Qualmed nonetheless presses its contention that only sections 3.3 and 5.34 provide a remedy for defects in the first step of the rating process, including use of inconsistent rating methodologies to establish market price. Section 5.9, according to Qualmed, does not apply to these first-step defects. Qualmed points out that section 5.9 is entitled \u201cPrice Reduction for <em>Defective Cost </em>or <em>Pricing Data </em>\u2014 Modifications,\u201d while section 3.3 is entitled \u201cRate Reduction for <em>Defective Pricing </em>or <em>Defective Cost </em>or <em>Pricing Data </em>\u201d (emphasis added). Qualmed also notes that section 3.3 refers to \u201c(3) the Carrier developed FEHBP rates with a rating methodology and structure inconsistent with that used to develop rates for similarly sized subscriber groups [SSSG].\u201d Thus, according to Qualmed, only section 3.3 addresses \u201cdefective pricing\u201d or the use of inconsistent rating methodologies, and the resulting failure to afford OPM the market price.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-5\">Sections 3.3 and 5.9, read in their entirety, however, do not contain the distinction urged by Qualmed. Section 3.3 states that if rates are calculated too high, <em>\u201cthe rate shall be reduced </em>in the amount by which the price was increased because of the defective data or information.\u201d In other words, section 3.3 does not address payment of interest, but instead requires reductions in inflated rates. Moreover, Qualmed\u2019s mistake \u2014 the selection of incorrect SSSGs \u2014 also fits with other provisions of section 3.3, namely, \u201c(1) ... cost or pricing data that were not complete, accurate, or current\u201d or \u201c(4) ... data or information of any description that were not complete, accurate, and current.\u201d This language is similar to section 5.9(b), which discusses \u201ccost or pricing data that were not complete, accurate, and current.\u201d Thus, the contract remedies incomplete or inaccurate pricing data under both section 3.3 and section 5.9. Section 3.3 remedies this problem by requiring a reduction in rates to correct the inaccuracies. Section 5.9 further remedies the same problem by permitting the Government to recover interest on any overpayments.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-7\">The purported distinction in the 1987 Federal Register between \u201cdefective pricing\u201d (as found by the OIG) and \u201cdefective cost or pricing data\u201d under section 5.9 does not alter this reading of the contract. The 1987 Federal Register entry may not expressly state that the selection of SSSGs is subject to section 5.9, but the Register entry also does not expressly exclude over-payments based on an incorrect selection of SSSGs from coverage under section 5.9. In other words, the Federal Register does not resolve the question of applicability of section 5.9 to this case. <em>PCA Health Plans, </em>on the other hand, necessarily decided that section 5.9 applies to overpay-ments based on incorrect selection of SSSGs. Particularly because this court implicitly decided the issue in <em>PCA Health Plans, </em>this court detects no legal distinction between \u201cdefective pricing\u201d and \u201cdefective cost or pricing data\u201d for applying section 5.9.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-9\">In <em>PCA Health Plans, </em>PCA argued that its 1991 modifications were \u201cbased on established catalog or market prices of commercial items sold in substantial quantities to the general public,\u201d and therefore, section 5.9 did not apply to those modifications. <em>Appeal of PCA Health Plans, </em>slip <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1325\">*1325</page-number>op. at 20. This court squarely addressed this issue:</p>\n<p id=\"b929-4\">PCA contends that its community rated contracts were \u201cmarket price\u201d contracts that fall under this exception. OPM, however, announced in the Federal Register that FAR 52.215-23 \u2014 section 5.9\u2014 would apply when a contractor \u201cpro-vid[es] defective cost or pricing data.... If the data on which the initial rate was converted is found defective, the clause provides a remedy for the Government.\u201d 52 Fed.Reg. 16036 (1987). PCA is charged with the knowledge of published regulations; it is therefore bound by OPM\u2019s interpretations of section 5.9.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-5\"><em>PCA Health Plans, </em>191 F.3d at 1356.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-6\">Likewise, Qualmed argues that the annual establishment of the FEHBP market price based on SSSGs is a price modification \u201cbased on ... market prices of commercial items sold in substantial quantities to the general public.\u201d As discussed in <em>PCA Health Plans, </em>insurance companies, including Qualmed, received notice in the Federal Register that section 5.9 would apply to defective cost or pricing data. For the reasons discussed above, Qualmed provided \u201cdefective cost or pricing data\u201d that was \u201cnot complete, accurate, and current\u201d when it selected incorrect SSSGs, and then used that inaccurate data in calculating its rate. Thus, section 5.9 applies to this case. The contracting officer correctly determined that Qualmed must pay interest from the date of overpayment in 1991 and 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b929-8\">Based on <em>PCA Health Plans </em>and the language in Qualmed\u2019s contract, this court concludes that section 5.9 applies to over-payments made by the Government to Qualmed for its medical plan coverage based on Qualmed\u2019s incorrect selection of SSSGs. Thus, Qualmed must pay simple interest on the Government\u2019s overpayment, computed from the dates of overpayment in 1991 and 1992. Accordingly, this court reverses the summary judgment of the Court of Federal Claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-10\">COSTS</p>\n<p id=\"b929-11\">Each party shall bear its own costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-12\">\n<em>REVERSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b926-6\">. $159,395 of this amount corresponds to interest charges for contract years 1988 and 1989. As noted in the Final Decision of OPM, dated April 7, 2000, Qualmed withdrew its claim that the 1988-89 contract did not provide for the recovery of interest from the date of overpayment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
