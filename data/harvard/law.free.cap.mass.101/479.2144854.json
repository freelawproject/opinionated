The defendant also requested the judge, in submitting the case to the jury, to instruct them <em>\u201c </em>that said contract was wholly void, because an illegal rate of interest was reserved therein.\u201d This ^request also the judge refused, and instructed the jury \u201cthat the : plaintiff was entitled to recover the price which the defendant had agreed to pay for the stock, less the amount paid by the defendant, and less the amount received from Dockray, with a further deduction of three times the unlawful interest reserved m the contract.\u201d The jury found for the plaintiff, and assessed damages in conformity with this instruction; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b488-6\"><em>J.
