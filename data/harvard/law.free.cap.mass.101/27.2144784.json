The plaintiffs in error, Lucy A. H. Robinson, a married woman, and Daniel S. Holman, had been convicted on an indictment under the Rev. Sts. <em>c. </em>125, \u00a7 17, charging that they <em>11 </em>maliciously did threaten one Donald McDonald to accuse said McDonald of having committed the crime of adultery with the said Lucy A. H. Robinson, with a view and with the intent\u201d of extorting money from McDonald The error assigned was that it did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>appear whether the defendants threatened \u201c verbally or by written or printed communication.\u201d Plea, <em>in nullo est erratum.</em></summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b36-5\"><em>F.

Whatever the means, the crime is the same, and so is the punishment. <em>Regina </em>v. Tiddeman, 4 Cox Crim. Cas. 387. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. O'Brien, 12 Cush. 84.

(2d ed.) 505.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b36-7\">Wells, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Alk\">The statute upon which this indictment was brought makes the offence to consist in threatening, \u201c either verbally or by any written or printed communication,\u201d to accuse, &amp;c. Rev. Sts. c. 125, \u00a7 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-8\">The indictment contains no averment that the threats charged were made in either form. If it were impossible that such a threat could be indicated without written or spoken words, it might be held that the offence was fully charged in the indictment as it stands, and so the omission be regarded as immaterial. But it does not appear to us to be so. In certain possible positions of the parties, and in connection with surrounding circumstances, acts, signs and looks may be equally significant with words, and equally effective for the purpose of extorting money. But such threats are not within the terms of the statute. The words \u201c either verbally or by any written or printed communication \u201d are part of the description of the offence ; and neither being averred in the indictment, no offence at all is charged. Everything essential to constitute the offence must be alleged, or a conviction will be ineffectual. <em>Hopkins </em>v. <em>Com</em>monwealth, 3 Met. 460, 467. <em>Commonwealth </em>v.
