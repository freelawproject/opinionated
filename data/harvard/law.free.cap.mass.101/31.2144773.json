The presiding judge, however, refused to stop the reading, <em>ffeld, </em>that such refusal, at that time, was matter of discretion, to the exercise of which no exceptions lay.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b39-9\">Indictment for receiving stolen goods. At the trial in the superior court, the defendant offered himself as a witness and testified in his own behalf. Upon his cross-examination he was asked whether a certain letter (which was shown to him, and was signed by a person who did not appear to have any interest in these goods) was not taken from him by the officers at the time of his arrest, and he answered that it was. The district attorney then began to read it, but, on the defendant\u2019s attorney asking to look at it, handed it to him. After retaining he paper as long as he wished, he handed it back to the district attorney, saying, \u201c I have no objection to its being read.\u201d The district attorney proceeded to read it to the jury. After the reading of the date and one or two sentences, the defendant\u2019s attorney objected to its admission as evidence in the case to be considered by the jury. But <em>Rockwell, </em>J., overruled the objeo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>tian, and admitted the paper. The defendant, being found guilty, alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b40-5\"><em>F.

Garbett, 1 Denison, 236; <em>The Queen </em>v. Whitehead, Law Rep. 1 C. C. 33; <em>Martin </em>v.

Allen, </em>Attorney General,</author>\n<p id=\"Aqz\">for the Commonwealth, did not argue the competency of the letter; but contended that, after the letter had been examined by the defendant\u2019s counsel, put in evidence and partly read with his consent, the refusal of the presiding judge to entertain an objection to its admission was within his discretion, to the exercise of which no exception lay. And of that opinion was the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
