On February 8, i960, judgment was entered by the Appellate Court affirming the .judgment of the trial court, based only on the common-law record. (24 Ill. App. 2d 302.) However, we have allowed defendant to file an additional record from which it appears that the report of proceedings was filed in time. In our review of the case we have therefore considered the evidence at defendant\u2019s trial.</p> <p id=\"b68-5\" pgmap=\"68\">Section 6 \u2014 303 of the Motor Vehicle Law (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1957, chap. 951/2, par. 6 \u2014 303), provides that any person who drives a motor vehicle on any highway of the State at a time when his license is revoked shall be punished by imprisonment for not less than seven days nor more than one year, and in addition there may be a fine not in excess of $1,000. In this case the trial judge sentenced the defendant to the State Penal Farm at Vandalia for the period of 180 days. We have read the report of proceedings with care and have reached the conclusion that the jury\u2019s verdict of guilty is sustained by competent proof, and that the penalty is proportionate to the nature of the offense and is within the limits of the statute. \u25a0</p> <p id=\"b68-6\" pgmap=\"68\">It would serve no good purpose for us to consider the many assignments of error that were so exhaustively discussed in the Appellate Court opinion. We concur in their analysis and disposition of the problems presented.</p> <p id=\"b68-7\" pgmap=\"68\">Judgment affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b68-8\" pgmap=\"68\">Mr. Justice Solfisburg took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
