The plaintiff proved that on June 9, 1900, an- inspector found upon a wagon at the Twenty-Third Street Ferry thirty cans of milk which bore defendant\u2019s mark. Although he examined some fifteen cans, he took from but one can two samples of milk, one of which he sealed, and gave to the driver, and the other to a chemist employed by the department, to be analyzed. The certificate of the chemist showed 88.84 per cent, of water, 11.16 per cent, milk solids, and 3.59 per cent, of milk fats in the sample, whereas the standard as fixed by the act required that the component' parts should be water 88 per cent., milk solids 12 per cent., and milk fats 3 per cent. It will be noticed by comparing the standard requirements with the component parts of the milk of the one can examined that the deviations from the standard were fractional as to two of the component parts, while as to the third,\u2014that of milk fats,\u2014which the law says must not be less than 3 per cent., the percentage was in fact 3.59. The question whether merely sampling one out of thirty cans was a compliance with the spirit of the statute may be doubted, because it seems, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>matter of first impression, to be manifestly unjust to do as the inspector here did, which was to examine fifteen cans, and then take a sample from one which he found to be the poorest, and confine the analysis to such sample. In People v. Wiard, 61 App. Div. 612, 69 N. Y. Supp. 1142, affi rmed 170 N. Y. 590, 63 N. E. 1120, it was said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-4\">\u201cAn analysis of a sample of milk taken from only part of the product delivered by the producer at any one time to a single purchaser will not afford a basis for an action for a penalty.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">Passing this point, however, we think that the learned judge at special term was right in dismissing the complaint upon the ground that the failure to make a second inspection at the farm of the mixed milk of the herd of cows from which the milk first sampled was drawn was fatal to recovery. Section 12 of the act provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-6\">\u201cIn taking samples of milk for analysis, * * * where the same is delivered by the producer, * * * the said commissioner of agriculture or assistant or his agent or servants shall within ten days thereafter with the consent of the said producer, take a sample in a like manner, of the mixed milk of the herd of cows from which the milk first sampled was drawn, and shall deliver the duplicate sample to the said producer, and shall cause the sample taken by himself or his agent to be analyzed. If the sample of milk last taken * * * shall upon analysis prove to contain no higher percentage of milk solids or no higher percentage of fats than as the sample taken (referring to the first sample), * * * then no action shall lie against the said producer,\u201d etc.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">It is admitted that no attempt was made to comply with this provision of the law, and the only question presented for our determination, therefore, is whether or not it is applicable. .In that connection the first consideration is as to whether the defendant was a producer, as distinguished from a mere seller, of milk. Although there were upon the wagon other cans of milk, the testimony shows that the milk from the can sampled bearing the defendant\u2019s mark came from his farm at Vails Gate, Orange county, and therefore the conclusion is supported that the defendant was a producer, as distinguished from a mere seller.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-8\">The argument that section 12 is only applicable to a criminal proceeding, and does not apply in an action for a penalty, we think is untenable. The language of section 12 is that \u201cno action shall lie against the said producer for violation of subdivisions 1, 2, 3, 7, and 8 of section 20 of the agricultural law,\u201d and subdivisions 1, 2, and 3 of section 20 refer in terms to the standards required with respect to the component parts of milk which we have discussed, and section 37 provides that penalties shall be imposed for a violation by any person of the provisions contained in article 2 of the agricultural law, in which article section 20 is to be found.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-9\">It follows, therefore, that the disposition made by the learned judge .at special term was right, and that the judgment appealed from .-should be aErmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
