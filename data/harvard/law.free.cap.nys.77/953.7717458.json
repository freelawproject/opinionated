She made her application therefor, and offered a premium of 10 per cent, thereof for the loan. The loan, $2,250, and the 10 per cent, thereof, $225, amounted to $2,475. The defendant took 24% shares of stock in the corporation, of the par value of $2,475, known as \u201cClass C\u201d stock. She paid $1 per share premium therefor ($2,475), and agreed to pay on the 1st day of each month 80 cents per share of stock ($19.80) until the loan was fully paid, as provided by the rules and regulations of the corporation. This 80 cents was made up of 50 cents per share ($12.38) interest at 6 per cent, on the $2,475, and 30 cents per share ($7.24) to apply in payment for the stock. August 25, 1899, the bond and mortgage were made and delivered, and the stock assigned as additional collateral to the loan. The defendant received in cash only $450, and the corporation assumed and agreed to pay a prior mortgage of $1,800 on the property, drawing interest at 5 per cent. The defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"954\">*954</page-number>then paid monthly the $19.80 from September 1, 1899, to June 30, 1901, both inclusive, amounting to $435.60. The corporation paid the interest on the $1,800 mortgage from September 1, 1899, to July 1, 1901, amounting to $165. A temporary receiver of the corporation was appointed July 15, 1901, and soon thereafter the corporation was dissolved, and a permanent receiver was appointed, and directed to \u2022close up the affairs of the corporation. The defendant never made default in any respect up to the time the temporary receiver was appointed. 'The withdrawal value of the stock when the receiver was appointed was $163.24, and the estimated value of the stock when the affairs of the corporation were closed up $32.64. Leaving out unnecessary details, the foregoing fairly represents the facts appearing from the submission.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-5\">We are not inclined to hold the loan usurious. It was an exorbitant compensation agreed to be paid for the use of the money, considering all the payments to be made by the defendant; but the legislature has legalized such agreements, and, \u2022 if parties will enter into them, they must take the consequences. It seems to be well settled, however, that when the corporation making the loan goes into the hands of a receiver, and it is no longer able to carry out the agreement, the borrower is relieved also from compliance with the terms thereof, and an equitable adjustment between the parties, must be made. In such cases the better rule seems to be that the borrower \u2022be charged with the money received from the corporation and the legal rate of interest thereon, and be credited with such payments as are referable to the loan itself, and not to the stock. This rule is based upon the theory that the relation of a member as a shareholder and a borrower are separate and distinct; that as Shareholder he should bear his proportionate share of the loss, but as borrower he should have the benefit of the' rescission of the contract, and should repay what he has received, less what he has paid on account thereof.

By this method of adjustment the defendant loses the $24.75 paid originally upon her stock, and also the $7.42 paid by her each month for 10 months upon the stock. She is allowed, however, all her coun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"955\">*955</page-number>sel asks for her in his brief submitted upon the argument, and substantial justice and equity are apparently done in the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-5\">Judgment should be ordered .for the plaintiff against the defendant for $392.25, with interest from July 1, 1901, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
