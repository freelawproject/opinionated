This order was made on the ground and for the reason that the David Kennedy estate owned stock in the corporation, and a proceeding was pending before the treasurer of Ulster county to ascertain the value of such stock in order that the value of the taxable transfers under the will of Dr. Kennedy might be fixed, and the learned justice at special term placed his decision specifically on this ground. It is a settled rule of law that where, in an application for a' peremptory writ of mandamus, the relators, as in this case, proceed wholly on the papers' presented, only undisputed statements of fact contained in the petition can be considered, and every other statement of fact contained in the answering papers must be assumed to be true. People v. New York Cent. &amp; H. R. Co., 156 N. Y. 570, 51 N. E. 312; People v. Brush, 146 N. Y. 60, 40 N. E. 502; People v. City of Brooklyn, 140 N. Y. 215, 43 N. E. 554; People v. St. Louis &amp; S. F. Ry. Co., 47 Hun, 543.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">From these papers it appears that Dr. David Kennedy in his lifetime sold to the Dr. David Kennedy Corporation certain formulas for the compounding of medicine, other property, and the good will of a business comprising the manufacture of proprietary medicines made from these formulas. He became then a stockholder in the corporation and an officer of it. By canvassing the public, and extensive and judicious advertising, the corporation established a large and lucrative business, its customers extending over a very considerable part of the country. Afterwards he was deposed as an officer of the corporation, and thereafter organized a rival establishment in the same city for conducting and carrying on practically the same business as that of the corporation defendant. He had sold to this corporation his name in connection with the business, formulas, and good will above mentioned, but he began to employ his name, which had become inseparably and valuably connected with these medicines, in the rival business. Even before this he had instituted lawsuits against the corporation, had attempted to seize its mail, and in many ways had manifested his ill-will towards it. He had asked for and obtained a reasonable statement of its affairs, assets, liabilities, and business, and these petitioners, after his death, have pursued the same course, with an evident desire and intent to injure the business of the corporation and build up the new and rival business which he had instituted. The material facts of the petition, other than the pendency of the inquiry before the <em>county </em>treasurer, are denied; the other facts above enumerated distinctly appear in the answering affidavits; and the inferences therefrom above suggested are inevitable. There is no longer any doubt of the right of a stockholder to examine the books of a corporation in a proper case and for a proper purpose (In re Steinway, 159 N. Y. 250, 53 N. E. 1103, 45 L. R. A. 461), but it must be in a proper case, and for a proper purpose. It is evident that the declared object of this desired examination, viz., to enable the county treasurer to ascertain the value of the stock of the corporation so that the value of the taxable transfers under Dr. Kennedy\u2019s will may be fixed, is a mere pretense, inasmuch as under the tax law the treasurer can subpoena <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>the officers of the corporation, and obtain from them thereunder all necessary information. It is apparent from the papers that the real object of the petitioners is to obtain information that will aid them in crippling the business of the defendant corporation, for the benefit of its business rival. This does not present a proper case for a peremptory mandamus, since it is clear that the object sought is not one-of which the law approves.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">The order must be reversed, and the proceedings dismissed, with $10 costs and the disbursements to the appellant. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
