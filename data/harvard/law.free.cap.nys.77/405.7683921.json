On appeal to the county court a new trial was had, and again a jury found a verdict of no cause of action. The county court set this verdict aside and directed a third trial. From this order an appeal is taken to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-23\">It appears that the sole question submitted to the jury was the question of the negligence of the defendant. The defendant was the owner of a piece of land upon which a maple tree some 19 inches through and 87 feet high was standing. It was 23 feet from- the traveled track of the highway. The plaintiff cut it down to use for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>firewood. The evidence supports the conclusion that in falling it would, in spite of all efforts to prevent, fall along and partly in the traveled track. When the tree was so- far cut that it began to fall, the defendant saw two teams approaching, going in the direction in which the tree was falling. Defendant, as a witness, says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-5\">\u201cI hollered, \u2018Hold on!\u2019 and run right into the road and waved my hand and hollered.- * * * They partly pulled the team to a Stop, and I says, \u2018Hold on!\u2019 * * * and Howe hollered, \u2018Hold on!\u2019 * * * I stood right side of the road, and probably within two feet of the track on the road. * * * I told Bishop [the driver of the-first team] to hold on, and as he got right up close by; * * * and I says: \u2018Hold on, you damned fools! Don\u2019t .go under that tree. You will get killed.\u2019 And they proceeded and grabbed the whip.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b434-10\">It appears from his testimony that the only attention paid to these warnings and efforts to stop them was to urge the horses to greater -speed. The first team passed under the tree. The second team was not so fortunate. The tree struck them, killing the horses and smashing the sleigh. This-evidence is partly corroborated by the only other witness on the subject,\u2014Bishop, sworn for the plaintiff. He says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-11\">\u201cI testified on the trial before the justice up at Pine. I there testified that I heard Waldron [defendant] calling me, warning me to stop, before 1 reached the tree, and that was true.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b434-12\">On this testimony it was submitted to the jury whether the defendant was negligent in not giving notice of the danger,\u2014sufficient notice; and apparently two juries have found that ample notice was given, and they might have found that it was willfully disregarded. That the jury was justified in its conclusion, from the evidence in this case, that defendant-was free from negligence, there can be no doubt. The learned trial judge made no ruling on the trial of which certainly the plaintiff has a right to complain,' and the same can be said of the -charge to the jury. The question submitted was a question of fact. It could not be \u00e1 question of law. It would have\" been error to have taken the question of defendant\u2019s negligence from the jury. The plaintiff\u2019s counsel asked the court to charge \u201cthat the act of the defendant in' falling the tree was, in itself, presumable negligence.\u201d This was properly refused. This is asking the court to instruct the jury that defendant was negligent as a matter of law. So there is no exception appearing in the record, available to the plaintiff, which would warrant an order for a new trial. The learned court, in stating its reasons for setting aside the verdict, says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-13\">\u201cBpon further examination of the case, I am of the opinion that I might have legally gone further, and have charged the jury that it was negligence per se to fall a tree of this size into a public highway used by the traveling public, and that, further than that, it was a wrong punishable by indictment under the Penal Code of the state of New York; and, upon the evidence before me, I might well have directed a verdict for the plaintiff.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b434-14\">We may properly presume that because of this understanding of the law the verdict was set aside. If this is a correct exposition of the law as applicable to this case, it was clearly the duty of the county \u25a0court to direct a new trial, to the end that the jury might be properly instructed, or a verdict directed. But we do not agree with the learned county court in this regard, and do agree with the under<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>standing of the court, expressed on the trial, that defendant\u2019s negligence was a question of fact for the jury, and not a question for the court to pass upon.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">The order of the county court in setting aside the verdict is reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the verdict is reinstated. All concur, except SMITH, J., who dissents.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
