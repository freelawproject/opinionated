This resolution appointing the relator was passed on the 13th day of November, 1901, \u201csaid appointment to take effect on and after November 14, 1901,\u201d and it appeared that the relator commenced work under this appointment on the 18th of November, 1901.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-10\">By rule 35 of the municipal civil service rules of the city of New' York, it is provided that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-11\">\u201cEvery original appointment to or employment in any position in the competitive class shall be made for a probationary term of three months, and an appointing or nominating officer, in notifying the person certified to him for employment, shall specify the same as for a probationary term only; and if the conduct and fitness of the probationer are satisfactory to the .appointing officer, his retention in the service after the end of such term -shall be equivalent to his permanent appointment, but if his conduct, capacity or fitness \"be not satisfactory, he may be discharged at the end of such term' without regard to the provisions of rule 42, limiting the power of removal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b690-12\">It\u2019 further appeared that the conduct and services of the relator were not. satisfactory; that on the 17th day of February, 1902, a \u25a0resolution was passed by the board of City Record of the city of New York ordering the relator\u2019s dismissal at the end of his probationary term of three months, and upon the same day notice thereof was given to the relator. The relator claims that his term' of service commenced on the 14th of November, 1901, and, his proba'tionary term having expired, his retendon in office beyond that time \u25a0 was equivalent to a permanent appointment, and thenceforth he could only be removed as provided for by rule 42 of the municipal civil \u2022service rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-15\">We think the court below incorrectly determined that the period \u25a0 of the relator\u2019s employment commenced from the date of his appointment. On the contrary, we think that it began when he commenced work under his appointment, and not from the date specified in the resolution appointing him. The relator did not hold a public of-fice.. He was an employ\u00e9 of the city, and his appointment was to take effect \u201con and after November 14th.\u201d His term of employment commenced when he accepted the appointment, by actually entering into the service of the city. The object of this probationary period is \u201cto enable the head of the department who has made the appointment not only to ascertain the fitness of the pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>bationer, but to learn whether, on the whole, he is a satisfactory and agreeable person to have serve in the position, and one who will become a reasonably efficient officer,\u201d and also to enable the appointee to familiarize himself with the duties of his employment, so that, after becoming acquainted with them, he will be able to perform them. People v. Kearney, 49 App. Div. 125, 62 N. Y. Supp. 1097, affirmed in 164 N. Y. 64, 58 N. E. 14. And it was held in that case that both the appointing officer and the appointee were entitled to the whole of the probationary period,\u2014the one to determine whether the appointee would make a competent and efficient employe; and the other, to demonstrate that fact to the appointing officer. To accomplish this result, it is quite evident that the period must be actually spent in the service of the city, and must therefore run, not from the time when the appointing power indicates to the appointee that he is to have the position, but from the time the employe actually commenced his work under his appointment. The rule provides that every original' appointment to or employment in any position in the competitive class shall be made after a probationary term of three months. The term of an employ\u00e9 commences from the time of his employment, and his employment commences when he actually commences work under the appointment. His discharge on February 17th, assuming that the probationary term commenced on the 18th, was proper; for that was upon the last day of the term, and the proper time for the appointing power to act.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">It follows that -the order appealed from should be reversed, and the application denied, with $50 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
