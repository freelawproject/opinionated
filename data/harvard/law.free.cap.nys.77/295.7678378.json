The complaint is for a breach of contract of sale for certain oil, in that but part thereof was delivered. The answer is general denial. The defendant has succeeded in changing the place of trial on the ground of the convenience of 21 witnesses, all in its employ. The defendant states that 15 of. them will testify to the quality of the ingredients of the oil, or of the oil which was furnished, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>and that 6 of them can testify to conversations had as to the alleged contract for the sale of said oil and with reference to the sale, made in Europe, in regard to the same, at variance with the claims set forth in the complaint. The learned counsel for the respondent in his brief discusses the merits of the appeal as if the question to be determined was whether oil furnished in full performance of the contract was up to the standard required by the contract, and states, \u201cUpon the argument of the motion at special term it appeared before the court that the defendant had in fact furnished the requisite number of barrels to complete the contract.\u201d But the moving affidavits, to- which we are confined, do not show anything of that kind. The answer is a general denial, and the defendant moves upon an affidavit which nowhere states that it proposes to give evidence, or to attempt to give evidence, that it performed the contract by furnishing or by tendering the quantity and quality of oil required thereby. If the facts stated in the counsel\u2019s points were embodied in his client\u2019s affidavit, we should not hesitate to affirm the order, but, as we are limited by the affidavit, we seek therein in vain for any facts which justify the change of venue, and the defendant must prevail by the strength of its own affidavit, and not by the technical defects of that read in answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">Order reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
