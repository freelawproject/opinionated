The motion proceeded on the assumption, based upon interviews with the attorney for the \u2022plaintiff, that the plaintiff would not claim that the defendant had possession of the painting entitled \u201cEve,\u201d and that title to the other painting is claimed by Rose L. Barclay.' The complaint has not been amended, and the plaintiff\u2019s attorney denies that he has made any agreement that he will not hold the warehouse company for both paintings. It is not pretended that Rose E- Barclay claims title \"to the painting \u201cEve.\u201d The painting \u201cFaust\u2019s Dream\u201d was seized \"by the sheriff pursuant to a replevin requisition issued in the action, \u25a0and the warehouse did not rebond it, and no longer has the possession or control thereof. It would be entirely proper to bring in Rose L. Barclay as a party defendant, since she claims to own one of the paintings; but that relief was not demanded. There was, however, no authority to grant the order appealed from, which, in effect, terminates the warehouse company\u2019s liability for both paintings.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-9\">The order should therefore be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion for an interpleader should be denied, with costs, without prejudice to a motion on the part of the warehouse company to bring in Rose L. Barclay as a party defendant. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
