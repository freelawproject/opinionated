I think that the learned special term (Wilmot M. Smith, J., presiding) was justified in finding that the plaintiff consented to the construction. She did object to the removal of the curbstone to the outside of the sidepath, but it appears that such curbstone was originally set at the expense of the Village Improvement Society, which consented to the removal; and I think, moreover, that the relocation thereof was within the control of the highway commissioners. The main contention of the learned counsel for the appellant is that the provision contained in section <em>2 </em>of chapter 640 of the Laws of 1900, \u201cno sidepath shall be constructed upon or along any regularly constructed or maintained sidewalk, except with the consent of the persons owning the abutting lands,\u201d makes the consent of the plaintiff a prerequisite to the construction of this sidepath. As it is undisputed that the sidepath is wholly outside of the sidewalk, it follows that such contention involves the proposition that the word \u201calong\u201d is synonymous with the word \u201calongside\u201d or \u201cadjoining.\u201d I think that the use of the word \u201calong\u201d in the phrase \u201cupon or along\u201d is to complete the idea of superimposition; for \u201cupon\u201d means \u201con,\u201d and a sidewalk presents the feature of length or extension, and I think that \"along\u201d is used in complement to that idea, as it m\u00e9ans literally, \u201cin line with, in connection with.\u201d Cent. Dict. In Pratt v. Railroad Co., 42 Me. 585, the court say: \u201cUnder the word \u2018along,\u2019 and as an adverb in Webster\u2019s Dictionary, is the follovting: \u2018Sax. and-lang, or ond-lang; Fr. au-long, le-long. See Long. The Saxons always prefixed \u2018and\u2019 or \u2018and,\u2019 and the same sense seems to be by the length, or opposite the length, or in the direction of the length.\u2019 \u201d In Heath v. Railway Co., 61 Iowa, 14, 15 N. W. 573, one provision of the ordinance authorized the construction of its road \u201calong\u201d an alley, and another provision a construction \u201con, over, and along,\u201d and the court held the words synonymous, and that in using the word \u201calong\u201d the ordinance did not authorize a construction \u201cby the side of.\u201d I think, then, that the word should be read as referring only to construction within the lines of the sidewalk. To give \u201calong,\u201d as used in this statute, the full force of \u201calongside of,\u201d is not to make it a synonym of another word, but is to disregard the force of a compound with the very same word, although such compound itself expresses the idea of locality, namely, beside, by the side of. Cent. Dict. In Arbenz v. Railroad Co., 33 W. Va. 1, 9, 10 S. E. 14, 17, 5 L. R. A. 371, it was held that the \u201cword \u2018along,\u2019 used with reference to a street, could not, in their statute, mean \u2018along the side\u2019 of the street, because such meaning would confer no' right whatever in respect to the street, but would leave the railroad to make its way through the adjoining lots, without the consent of the state or any aid from this statute.\u201d I think that the plain intent of the statute is to permit the construction of sidepaths within the lines of highways, and to limit their location within such lines, but not to permit construction upon any regular sidewalk, unless the abutting <em>owner </em>consent. The bicycle is to be regarded as a vehicle that may properly be used upon highways. Ryan v. Preston, 59 App. Div. 97, 69 N. Y. Supp. 100; 1 Thomp. Com. Neg. 1335, and authorities cited; Elliot, Roads &amp; S., and authorities cited. In Ryan v. Preston, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>supra, we held, per Hirschberg, J., that the bicycle does not impose an additional burden upon the highway, but that as a carriage or a vehicle it has place upon the public roadways; and that the statutes authorizing sidepaths within the lines of a highway are constitutional, in that they were regulations in the furtherance of the safety and convenience of the public. It is not to be assumed that the legislature would intend to make this regulation of the use of a highway in the interest of the public lawfully traveling thereon depend upon the consent of the adjacent property owner. There is no good reason for it, for it does not appear that any right of the abutting owner could be affected by requiring bicycles in the highway to be kept apart from other vehicles, instead of traveling on all parts of the highway. On the other hand, to permit any abutter, as such, to veto this regulation of public traffic within the lines of a public way, would put it within the power of an individual whose rights were not involved to defeat a measure adopted for the safety and convenience of the public. But there are obvious reasons for prohibiting the permanent invasion of the sidewalk by constructing thereon a way for vehicles which are classed with carts, wagons, or carriages, and the consequent destruction of the distinctive character of -the sidewalk without the abutter\u2019s consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">The judgment should be affirmed, w\u2019ith costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
