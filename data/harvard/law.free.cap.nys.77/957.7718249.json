The property was at 71 Carey street, in the city of Buffalo, N. Y., and was leased by plaintiff to defendant to be used as a livery for mobile station carriages. The lease was in writing, and was set out in the complaint in full. Among other provisions therein contained was the following: \u201cThe Mobile Company agree to conform to the fire underwriters\u2019 rules as to the storage and care of gasoline.\u201d The complaint alleged what those rules provided in detail, and further alleged in brief that the defendant, in violation of its agreement in the lease, failed to conform to such rules as to the storage and care of gasoline, but stored and handled the same in violation of such rules, and as a result thereof plaintiff\u2019s property was set on fire, and completely burned and destroyed. The fire having been caused by the handling of large quantities of gasoline within and about the building <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"958\">*958</page-number>in the nighttime, the insurance companies in which the buildings were insured refused absolutely to pay the insurance thereon, and by reason of the premises the plaintiff suffered damages, which he claimed to recover. These were, in effect, the allegations of the complaint, to which no objection was made. In addition the allegations 'sought to be struck out were inserted in the complaint, as follows: \u201cThat at the time of making the said agreement [the written lease] it was, in addition thereto, specifically agreed and understood by and between the parties thereto that the handling of gasoline openly was dangerous, and that the handling of gasoline within the building in any manner was extremely dangerous, and liable to cause explosion and fire; and that it was specifically understood and agreed between the parties that no' gasoline would be handled within the buildings; that the gasoline to be used by the defendant in its motors was to be stored in a barrel outside the buildings, and to be handled entirely outside the buildings\u201d; and that the damage was caused by a violation of these agreements. It was claimed by the defendant that these allegations were irrelevant and redundant, that the defendant was aggrieved thereby, and they should, therefore, be stricken out, under section 545, Code Civ. Proc Relief of this kind rests largely in the discretion of the court, and should be granted only when it is evident, if denied, the moving party will be aggrieved by the allegation remaining in the pleading. It does not appear by the pleading whether the agreements referred to in these allegations were in writing or by paroi. If in writing, they could certainly be proved on the trial, having been made at the same time as the lease, and having been alleged in the complaint. Possibly they could be proven if by paroi. It can be more satisfactorily determined off the trial, whether the agreements were valid, and constituted, in whole or in part, a basis for plaintiff\u2019s right of action. Whether the agreements were within the rules of the fire underwriters, and so covered by the lease, will depend upon whether there were any rules, and what they were. The plaintiff alleges there were rules, and sets out the nature thereof. The defendant may concede there were rules, and that they are correctly 'set out in the complaint, or it may controvert the allegations of the complaint with reference thereto. Then the issues so raised can only be determined upon the trial. If the agreements in question go beyond the rules as finally established, we see no reason why they might not be relied upon in whole or in part as a basis of plaintiff\u2019s right of action, especially if in writing. While technically it might be 'said that the allegations, if immaterial, would, if allowed to remain in the complaint, aggrieve the defendant, yet we think under the circumstances the court very properly denied the motion to strike them out, and the order should be affirmed, with $10 costs and disburs\u00e9ments. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
