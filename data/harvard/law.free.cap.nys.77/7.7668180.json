Levoy (May, 1902) 76 N. Y. Supp. 783.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">The second proposition is based upon reading section 351 of the Penal Code in connection with section 17 of chapter 570 of the Laws of 1895, which prescribes an exclusive penalty of the forfeiture of the amount of the bet when made or recorded upon a race course. It was held by the court of appeals in the case of People v. Fallon, 152 N. Y. 1, 46 N. E. 302, 37 L. R. A. 419, that the section cited from the act of 1895 was constitutional and valid. We think that the decision of the court of appeals in that case necessarily implies that section 351 of the Penal Code is also constitutional. See last paragraph of the opinion of Martin, J., 152 N. Y. on page 12, 46 N. E. 304, 37 L. R. A. 419.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">The order appealed from should be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
