The plaintiff thereupon moved to vacate such order upon the ground that, as no cause of action existed in favor of anybody prior to the appointment of the plaintiff as trustee, the provisions of section 3268 did not apply. There is no doubt as to the correctness of the plaintiff\u2019s contention in this respect. Rielly v. Rosenberg, 57 App. Div. 408, 68 N. Y. Supp. 265. It is only where the cause of action has existence prior to the adjudication in bankruptcy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>that the defendant becomes entitled to require security for costs as matter of right. Schreier v. Hogan, 70 App. Div. 2, 74 N. Y. Supp. 1051. The court below denied the motion to vacate upon the ground that by virtue of section 3271 of the Code of Civil Procedure there existed the right to grant the order requiring security for costs to be filed in its discretion. It is undoubtedly true that the court possesses such power, and may exercise it in a proper case; but the application under this section cannot be made ex parte. Notice is required, and application must be made to the court. Pursley v. Rodgers, 44 App. Div. 139, 61 ,N. Y. Supp. 1015. It is clear, therefore, that the first order was improperly granted, and the plaintiff became entitled to have his motion granted, unless the court was authorized upon the motion to vacate to hear and determine the question upon the merits, treating the same as though motion had been made therefor, as the parties were then all before the court. There is authority for such conclusion, and in a proper case the court may consider and dispose of the question of the right to the security for costs as a discretionary matter upon a motion made to vacate the ex parte order. Corbett v. Brantingham, 65 App. Div. 335, 72 N. Y. Supp. 763. It is the settled rule, however, that the defendant must make his motion to file security for costs before service of the answer, as by such service he waives the right to such security. Hull &amp; Co. v. McNally, 33 App. Div. 132, 53 N. Y. Supp. 351. In the present case, therefore, the plaintiff was entitled to relief upon two grounds: First, the Code did not authorize an ex parte application; and, second, there was waiver of right to security by the service of the answer. The court, however, had power to relieve from the latter condition upon the defendant showing facts which excused its default in not moving earlier, and relieving from the effect of the waiver. It is the claim of the respondents that they showed themselves entitled to such relief. The affidavit in excuse, however, shows that the defendant served his answer with full knowledge of what its effect would be. He avers as an excuse that he could obtain no extension of time to answer, and that the court for ex parte business was not in session, so that he could not obtain an extension of time. It is not disclosed by the affidavit that he made the slightest effort to procure an order extending his time to answer. Such order could be granted by any judge, either in or out of court. There is not a word in the defendants\u2019 affidavit to show that he ever prepared a paper or sought to find a judge to obtain an order of extension, but, relying upon the fact that the court was not in session, served his answer, and took his chances of being relieved from the condition in which such act placed him. There is, therefore, not the slightest excuse shown entitling the defendants to relief from the waiver which the service of the answer involved. Nor did they attempt to take immediate action to secure such result, but, on the contrary, applied ex parte, and as matter of right. There was no ground, therefore, upon which the court was authorized to exercise its discretion under section 3271 of the Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">The order should therefore be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion granted, .with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
