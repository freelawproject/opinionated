From a judgment for defendant, plaintiff appeals. Reversed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b696-13\">The complaint in this action states, in substance, that in November, 1900, the plaintiff and her husband, who is since deceased, executed and delivered to the defendant a conveyance of certain premises therein described, and such conveyance is made a part of the complaint; that such conveyance was made upon the agreement that the defendant should comfortably maintain, support, and clothe, and provide a home for, both herself and husband, during the term of their lives, and of the survivor of them, and furnish and provide suitable burial for each of them at their decease; that it was also covenanted in such conveyance that such care, maintenance, support, and burial should be and remain until their decease a lien upon the prepises therein described; that the defendant at once entered into possession of the premises under such deed, and still holds the same; and that, she and her husband lived and made their home there with such defendant. So much of the .complaint is admitted by the answer. The complaint further avers that now the defendant has wholly failed and refuses to comfortably maintain, support, and clothe her, and to provide proper and necessary food for her support. In short, it avers an utter and complete breach of the contract on the defendant\u2019s part, greatly to her injury in health and to her damage. The complaint then prays for a decree of the court vacating and setting aside the contract between them, and annulling and declaring void such conveyance, and also for such other judgment and relief as to the court shall seem just, and for costs of the action. These latter averments are denied by the answer. It also sets up as an affirmative defense that the defendant has expended large sums in providing a burial place for the parties, and for the burial of the husband, and has paid for repairs and improvements upon the p\u2019.~ 'e, and assumed the payment of a mortgage thereon, and that no part of such sums has ever been repaid to him. The issues so made were brought to trial at a special term of this court, and upon the opening of the case a motion was made .by the defendant to dismiss the complaint upon the ground that it fails to state a cause of action. Such motion was granted, and judgment ordered accordingly. Prom the judgment so entered, this1 appeal is taken.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b696-14\">Argued before PARKER, P.

Assuming, as we must, -that the defendant \u201chad ceased to furnish the requisite food, support, and clothing, and refused to longer perform the contract on his part, the plaintiff would be entitled, under the covenant in the conveyance, to have a proper sum fixed by the court, sufficient to furnish such support, and such sum declared a lien upon the premises, and that it be enforced by a sale thereof. Stehle v. Stehle, 39 App. Div. 440, 57 N. Y. Supp. 201. Such relief, at least, she is, upon the averments in her complaint, clearly entitled to; and the court had the power, and it was its duty, upon her establishing the same, to award her a judgment to that effect. An answer having been interposed, she was not limited to the precise relief claimed, but under her prayer for further relief she was entitled to any consistent with the case set forth in the complaint. Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 1207; Murtha v. Curley, 90 N. Y. 372; Bell v. Merrifield, 109 N. Y. 202, 207, 16 N. E. 55, 4 Am. St. Rep. 436.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">For this reason, it was error to dismiss the complaint, and the judgment must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">Judgment reversed, and new trial granted; costs to appellant to abide \u25a0event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
