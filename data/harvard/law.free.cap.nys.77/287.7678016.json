On the <em>2d </em>day of January, 1898, the appellant was the owner of a milk business and route in said city; and he, together with many other like owners, on that day made an agreement in writing with certain trustees for a sale and transfer of the milk business to them. The agreement recites that the parties contemplated forming a corporation. The vendors covenanted that \u201cfrom and after the time that the said businesses are, respectively, transferred to the said corporation, the said parties hereto agree not to enter upon their own account in any territory or district known as the \u2018Greater New York\u2019 for a term of twenty years from date thereof, and that they, nor either of them, will engage in the said business, either directly or indirectly, or be in any manner interested in other business, excepting that of the corporation to be formed as hereinabove stated.\u201d On the 14th day of January, 1902, the respondent obtained an injunction order restraining the appellant, pendente lite, from \u201cin any manner entering into competition with the plaintiff, * * * or engaging in the milk business, directly or indirectly, in the territory of Greater New York, either as principal or agent, or in any form or manner doing or becoming interested in any milk business other than that of\u201d the plaintiff, and \u201cfrom in any manner injuring, impairing, or destroying the good will transferred from said defendant\u201d to' the plaintiff, and from, \u201ceither personally, or by agent, servant, or employ\u00e9 soliciting or interfering with any of the customers transferred from this defendant to the plaintiff.\u201d In the order from which the appeal is taken it is \u201cordered, adjudged, and determined that the defendant, Dietrich Tietjen, is guilty of a contempt of this court, in having willfully disobeyed the injunction order, * * * in that he engaged in the milk business, directly or indi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>rectly, in the district or territory of Greater New York, and that he became interested, directly or indirectly, in a milk business other than that of the Mutual Milk &amp; Cream Company, and that he, either on his own behalf, or on behalf of some other person, solicited and interfered with the plaintiff\u2019s customers.\u201d It appears that the appellant\u2019s brother is the owner and proprietor of a milk route in the city of New York. The moving affidavits show that on various occasions, subsequent to the sale of his milk business under said agreement, the appellant has driven one of his brother\u2019s milk wagons, from which milk has been delivered by a helper to' parties who were formerly customers of the respondent, and that on one occasion the appellant personally so delivered milk from the wagon. Several of the affiants from these facts draw the inference, and give it as their belief, that the appellant is interested in the milk business, and is soliciting customers therefor, but no other facts are stated. The appellant\u2019s affidavit shows that he is employed by his brother as a driver of a milk wagon at a salary of $10 per week, and that he is in no manner interested in the business, and has not solicited any customers for his brother. The affidavit of the brother is to the same effect, and he explains how he obtained the customers who were formerly patrons of the respondent. Other affidavits are also presented, which show that the brother obtained these customers without the intervention of the appellant. The belief of the affiants that the appellant is interested or engaged in the milk business, or has solicited customers for his brother, is no' proof of the fact. We have, therefore, merely proof that the appellant is acting as driver for his brother in the latter\u2019s milk business, and occasionally delivers or assists in delivering milk from the wagon to his brother\u2019s customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-3\">It appears that the proposed injunction order originally presented for settlement by the respondent would have enjoined the appellant, \u201ceither as principal, agent, or employ\u00e9,\u201d and that the order proposed by the appellant, which was adopted by the court, omitted the word \u201cemploy\u00e9.\u201d The respondent then made a motion to resettle the order by omitting the word \u201cemploy\u00e9,\u201d and in other respects. The court resettled the order, modifying it in some particulars, but adhered to the omission of the word \u201cemploy\u00e9.\u201d It is shown that appellant\u2019s counsel specifically drew the attention of the court to his objection to\" the word \u201cemploy\u00e9\u201d being incorporated, which was that it would be subject to enjoin the appellant from earning his living as an ordinary employ\u00e9 in the milk business of another. After the order was resettled, the appellant was then advised by his counsel that he was not restrained from working for his brother in this capacity, provided he did not solicit trade. In these circumstances, it is extremely doubtful whether the appellant violated the injunction order at all. But even if the injunction order should be construed as enjoining services such as he has rendered tO' his brother, at most it was only a technical contempt, for which he might be fined the amount of damages shown to have been sustained by the respondent, together with costs. Power v. Village of Athens, 19 Hun, 165; Moffat v. Herman, 116 N. Y. 131, 22 N. E. 287; Dejonge v. Brenneman, 23 Hun, 332. This, however, would require an adjudication upon competent proof not only of the facts unequivocally stated which constituted the violation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>injunction order, but that such violation \u201cwas calculated to or actually did defeat, impair, impede or prejudice the rights or remedies\u201d of the respondent. Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7\u00a7 14, 2266, 2281, 2284; Association v. Kuhn, 51 App. Div. 583, 64 N. Y. Supp. 933; Daily v. Fenton, 47 App. Div. 418, 62 N. Y. Supp. 337; Mahon v. Mahon, 50 N. Y. Super. Ct. 92; Cronin v. Crooks, 76 Hun, 123, 27 N. Y. Supp. 822; Id., 143 N. Y. 352, 38 N. E. 268. The order neither adjudicates definitely the facts constituting the violation, nor does it contain even a recital that the acts of the appellant were calculated to, or did, defeat, impair, impede, or prejudice the rights or remedies of the respondent, and no damages have been shown. Nor can the order be sustained as an adjudication of a criminal contempt, under sections 8 and 9 of the Code of Civil Procedure. In such case the punishment is imposed to vindicate the dignity of the court, and in the interest of public justice, and not for the benefit of the party. The fine belongs to the public, and not to the moving party, and costs are not allowed. Boon v. McGucken, 67 Hun, 251, 22 N. Y. Supp. <em>424; </em>People v. Gilmore, 88 N. Y. 628; People v. Court of Oyer and Terminer, 101 N. Y. 246-248, 4 N. E. 259, 54 Am. Rep. 691. The order, on the contrary, requires the payment of both costs and fine to the respondent\u2019s attorney. Furthermore, the facts would not justify a finding that the violation of the injunction order was willful, which is essential to authorize punishment as for a criminal contempt. It may well be that the appellant acted in entire good faith. It appears that the matter was substantially brought to the attention of the judge who made the order, and, in view of the elimination of the word \u201cemploy\u00e9\u201d from the order proposed by the respondent, the appellant should be given the benefit of the doubt; and it should not be inferred against him, as the basis of punishment for a criminal contempt, that he willfully violated the order, even assuming that it did enjoin the acts which he has performed. Railroad Co. v. Ramsey, 45 N. Y. 641; People v. Aitken, 19 Hun, 329; Billings v. Carver, 54 Barb. 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">The observations we have made with reference to the requirement of an adjudication of the facts in the order for the punishment of a civil contempt apply equally here.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">The order should therefore be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion denied, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
