From the nature of the crime charged, and the participation of the two witnesses upon whose testimony the conviction was based, it was of the utmost importance to the rights of the defendant that he should have the full benefit of any testimony he might be able to produce which would bear upon his good character. He went upon the stand and denied that he had committed the crime of which he was accused, and that he had ever seen or known the witnesses who testified against him. Upon this state of the record, the question of defendant\u2019s guilt was a close one, and the error in excluding thereafter testimony offered by him as to his character, which evidence was entirely competent, was necessarily harmful. This error was not cured by the concession of the district attorney, made after he had ascertained his mistake in having such evidence excluded, that \u201cthe witnesses offered by the defense as to good character would testify that the general reputation of the defendant is good.\u201d The defendant, having the witnesses in court, and having placed them upon the stand, was entitled to the benefit of their oral testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-19\">Judgment, accordingly, should be reversed, and a new trial ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
