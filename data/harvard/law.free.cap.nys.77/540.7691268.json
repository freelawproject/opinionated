As we read the papers on this appeal, we think that the plaintiff has established a clear right to the injunction it asked for. It is a corporation organized under the laws of the state of Maine, and carrying on business in the city of New York. It is the owner and proprietor of a natural spring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>\u25a0of water, and for many years the water flowing from that spring has been known under the name of Poland Water, and has been put up by the proprietor in glass bottles, which have been labeled and sold by the plaintiff under the name of Poland Water. It is made to appear by affidavit that this defendant had, prior to the_ beginning of this action, taken the bottles which had contained genuine Poland Water, and which bore the plaintiff\u2019s labels, trade-marks, seals, and signature, filled them with distilled water which was not Poland Water, and sold them, with their contents of distilled water, as and \u25a0for genuine Poland Water. It further appears that the defendant was prosecuted criminally for committing the acts of which the plaintiff complains, and that he pleaded guilty in the court of special sessions in the First division of the city of New York, was fined for the offense, and that he paid the fine.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">Here, then, there is in proof the fact that the defendant has committed acts which would entitle the plaintiff upon final judgment to the relief he demands of an injunction to restrain the defendant and his servants from using the Poland Water bottles, trade-marks, labels, seals, or other property of the plaintiff in the sale of any other than genuine Poland Water, and from refilling such bottles with any \u25a0other than such genuine Poland Water. It may be that the defendant will voluntarily desist from infringing the rights of the plaintiff her\u00e9after, but that possibility, or even probability, furnishes no ground for denying the plaintiff the protection of an injunction. The plaintiff is not compelled to rely upon the defendant\u2019s present virtuous intentions. What the defendant did was a wanton invasion of the plaintiff\u2019s right, as well as a deception practiced upon the public, and a repetition of such acts should be prevented effectually by the restraining order of a court of equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">The order appealed from should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion foj an injunction pendente lite granted, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
