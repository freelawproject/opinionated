The article first charged that a butcher, not named, had been selling horse flesh as beefsteak for six weeks; that the health board inspectors had made a tour of the West Side butcher shops, and as a result \u201csix marketmen were before Magistrate Deuel, in the Jefferson Market police court, yesterday, charged with selling tainted meat.\u201d It is then said that one John Rann was arrested for having 600 pounds of horseflesh in his store; that he was held for trial under $300 bail; and that five persons named, of whom the plaintiff was one, were held for trial for a violation of an ordinance which forbids butchers to display meat in the street. The complaint alleges that by this article the defendant charged the plaintiff with having been guilty of a violation of section 50 of the Sanitary Code of the City of New York, and that he had been guilty of the offense of selling putrid, tainted, rotten, and spoiled meat. At the trial it appeared that upon the day in question this plaintiff, with several other butchers, was charged before the magistrate with a violation of section 47 of the Sanitary Code of the City of New York, which provides that \u201cno meat, poultry, game or fish shall be hung or exposed for sale outside of any shop or store in this city, or in the open windows and doorways thereof,\u201d and were held for trial for a violation of this ordinance, and subsequently were fined $10 each. This offense is the only offense which the article in question stated that the plaintiff had been charged with. He was not connected in any way with the previous statement that six marketmen had been charged with selling tainted meat. In fact, it was not stated that he was a marketman at all, and there was no connection in any way between the charge of selling tainted meat and the charge for a violation of the ordinance forbidding butchers to display meat in the street. No one reading this article would connect the \u00e1ix marketmen not named, charged with selling tainted meat, with the five butchers named, and charged with the violation of the-ordinance. Nor do we think that the concluding statement, \u201cin each store tainted poultry was found,\u201d is libelous. The statement of the fact that in a butcher shop tainted poultry had been found does not charge the butcher with a crime, and was not relied on in the complaint or upon the trial as sufficient to sustain the action. Section 408 of the Penal Code provides that \u201ca person who, with intent that the same may be used as food, drink or medicine, sells, or offers or ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>poses for sale, any article whatever which, to his knowledge, is tainted or spoiled, or for any cause unfit to be used as such food, drink or medicine, is guilty of a misdemeanor.\u201d The fact that in a butcher\u2019s shop there was found poultry or meat that had become tainted, when such poultry or meat was not sold or exposed for sale or intended for sale, would neither be charging a crime nor an offense of any kind. There is no allegation of special damage, and to sustain the action the article must be libelous per se. Considering the whole article, it is. quite clear that what the defendant intended to do was to give an account of a judicial proceeding before a magistrate in which this defendant, with others, had been charged with a violation of an ordinance of the city of New York, and so far as this defendant made any charge against this plaintiff his own testimony shows the article to be true.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">I think the court was justified in dismissing the complaint, and that the judgment appealed from should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
