Y., pursuant to statute do hereby establish by this certificate a water-supply district in said town of Altamont, Franklin county, N. Y., and do establish the following bounds,' to wit: Said water-supply district shall have the same boundaries as the said town of Altamont, Franklin county, N. Y.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">And on the same day the town board entered into the written con-tract in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-9\">The record shows: That the town of Altamont is 18 miles long and 6 miles wide. Much the greater portion of the town is wild, unoccupied forest land, and some portions mountainous. Eighty per cent, of the inhabitants of the town reside in two villages,\u2014Tupper Lake Village, having about 2,000 inhabitants, and Tupper Lake Junction, having about 250; the two villages being about two miles apart. That the assessed valuation of the whole town is $538,543. That of this amount, $209,534 is the assessed valuation of the property of the villages, and $329,009 is the assessed valuation of the town outside the two villages. That the contract provides for a water supply for the two villages and the street between the two villages. The streets in which the pipe line was to run are named in the contract, and there is nothing obligatory upon the relator to lay lines of pipe elsewhere. It is plain that the object of the law authorizing the designation of a water-supply district is solely for the purpose of making a contract with some corporation for a supply of water. The town is not here authorized to create a water supply or lay pipe or erect hydrants. The contract, therefore, and the district designated, must correspond in area. The district established cannot properly be greater than the district to be supplied under the contract. A large district cannot be designated for the purpose of taxation to pay for a water supply to a part only of such district. That is not the intention of the act. The meaning of the act is plain. The area to be designated as a water-supply district must be just the area which the authorized contract is to supply with water \u201cfor fire, sanitary or other public purposes.\u201d The district here established is the whole town of Altamont, 18 miles long and 6 miles wide, or 108 square miles of territory, and the contract calls for a supply of water to less than 1 square mile. It is needless to say that here is a clear attempt to pervert the law, both in its letter and spirit,\u2014an attempt to make those who are not benefited pay for benefits enjoyed by others. This the law neither authorizes nor permits. The contracting corporation was bound to know the law, and bound to know that all the authority the town board possessed was derived from this statute. The fact that water has been supplied under the contract creates no claim against the town of Altamont, in law or equity. The claim was therefore properly rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-10\">Judgment is directed against the relator and in favor of defendants for $50 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
