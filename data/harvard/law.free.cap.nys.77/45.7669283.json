There are six exceptions by the plaintiff to rulings of the referee upon questions of evidence, but none of these discloses any error. Notwithstanding the absence of any exception to the decision, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>we have carefully gone over the evidence, and are of the opinion that it fully sustains the referee\u2019s conclusion.
