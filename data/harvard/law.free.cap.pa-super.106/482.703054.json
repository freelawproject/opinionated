The city claims that the highway is a part of the park area, and that the plaintiffs have no right of access to it. The city is about to erect a fence along plaintiffs\u2019 premises thus preventing an entry on the road by the plaintiff or her tenant.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\">The court, upon application made by the plaintiffs, issued a preliminary injunction restraining for the time being the erection of the fence until final determination of the matter. The court states: \u201cThe facts present a case of threatened injury which would be irreparable. For this reason, the city\u2019s hand should be stayed until the reciprocal rights of the parties can be settled by trial of the issue.\u201d The action of the court was apparently based on reasonable grounds, and this is the only matter which concerns us now. We refrain from a discussion of the merits of the litigation, which cannot be determined at this stage of the proceedings: Conrad v. Stillman, 96 Pa. Superior Ct. 356, and cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">The order is affirmed and the appeal is dismissed at the cost of the appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
