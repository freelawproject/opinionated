We raised the question during the oral argument, and we think the order was not one from which the statutes permit an appeal. The opinion of the court below is published<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and we quote from that decision at page 649, this statement of what the case is about:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AGhK\">\u201c * * * The complaint alleges a conspiracy, both vertical and horizontal, between fifteen corporate defendants, including most of the major film producing and distributing companies in the United States. The purpose of the conspiracy is to destroy competition between defendants\u2019 theaters and independent theaters such as the plaintiff\u2019s. To achieve this result, defendants have established and maintained a nation-wide system of distribution control effectuated by interrelated contracts, agreements and franchises at the various levels of their corporate activity.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b612-14\">The published opinion also calls attention to the fact that the conspiracy is alleged to have continued since 1947, to have resulted in losses to appellant in box office receipts, as well as in prestige, standing and good will, and that the conspiracy has continued from the time Delta\u2019s theater opened with the single purpose of eliminating it from competition. The opinion also notes that the losses claimed could be attributed equally well to Delta\u2019s inability to exhibit a particular film, or to offer any film of prime quality on a particular night, or to a general lack of confidence in Delta\u2019s offerings due to the inferior films it had been forced to exhibit in the past.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-15\">From these references to the complaint it is manifest that it presents only one claim or cause of action, and that the ruling of the court below relates to recoverable items of damage alone. The case is, therefore, ruled by our decision in King v. California Co., 5 Cir., 1955, 224 F.2d 193, petition for rehearing denied 5 Cir., 236 F.2d 413. We held that the complaint there embraced one single claim for damages to real estate and appellant\u2019s right of possession and enjoyment thereof, and we dismissed the appeal because the sum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>mary judgment granted by the court did nothing more than limit the right of recovery to certain years and to certain items of damage. What we said there applies equally here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-5\">\u201c * * The right to appeal is based upon statute, and * * * It is clear that the judgment before us does not come within the ambit of either of those statutes. It is in no sense a final judgment. It is not final as to all parties or as to any party or as to the whole subject matter of the litigation or any facet of it. It does not terminate the litigation and does not grant any relief to appellant or against the ap-pellees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-10\">\u201cThe complaint here sets out one single claim, * * *. That claim covers a number of years and embraces a large number of alleged negligent actions on the part of the appellees or some of them. The judgment does not seek to adjudicate that claim. It purports only to limit appellant\u2019s right to recover certain of the items of damage claimed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-11\">* \u2022\u00bb * * \u2022* \u00ab-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-12\">\u201cIf appellant is barred from recovery of damages accruing during a certain period involved in his civil action, he may, nevertheless, * * * be entitled to recover damages accruing during the other years embraced in his complaint. Moreover, there is nothing final in the determination made by the district court. When it hears the case on the merits, it may have a different idea about the impact of this testimony. * * *\u201d (at page 196)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b613-14\">The same is true here. As the court below points out in its opinion, Delta\u2019s claim is based upon a continuing conspiracy and doubtless, in its effort to establish the conspiracy, it will make proof of transactions covering many years. The order of the court limiting the items of recoverable damage and the time of their accrual has no efficacy in the decision of Delta\u2019s claim. We discussed the authorities now advanced by the parties in King, and adverted to the fact that they were in conflict. We held up final judgment in that case until the Supreme Court could set its hand to the resolving of some of those conflicts. But the decision of the Supreme Court did not, in our opinion, militate against the views we had theretofore expressed in King.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b613-19\">Our attention is called to the fact that the trial court, in this case, certified in its final judgment that \u201cthere is no just reason for delay.\u201d We discussed the effect of such a certificate in King.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> And cf. Reagan v. Traders &amp; General Ins. Co., 5 Cir., 1958, 255 F.2d 845, and Meadows v. Greyhound Corp., 5 Cir., 1956, 235 F.2d 233.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b613-20\">Under these cases we think the order entered by the court below was not ap-pealable and the appeal is Dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b612-16\">.
