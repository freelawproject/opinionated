It was acted on, accepted, and the assessment based upon that acceptance was made by the defendant in this action.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The \u201c90-day letter,\u201d or statutory notice, mandated by I.R.C.1939, \u00a7 272,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> as amended, was. not sent to the taxpayers, Harold G.. Steiner and Ollie Mae Steiner, his wife. Acting under I.R.C.1954, \u00a7 6213, 26 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 6213 (formerly \u00a7 272(a), I.R.C~ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>1939) the defendant District Director proceeded to make levies on taxpayers\u2019 property and they filed a complaint for injunction in the district court seeking to have defendant, and other Revenue Department officials, enjoined \u201cfrom making, beginning or prosecuting any dis-traint or proceeding in court or from issuing any summonses, subpoenas or levies for the collection of the taxes allegedly due the United States Government for the year 1945 from Harold G. Steiner, one of the plaintiffs herein for the years 1946 and 1947 from Harold G. Steiner and Ollie Mae Steiner, plaintiffs herein, until the expiration of the 90-day period after notice of a determination of deficiency is properly mailed in the manner set forth and within the time limited by the appropriate provisions of the Internal Revenue Code to the Plaintiffs by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, or, if a petition is filed with the Tax Court, until the decision of the Tax Court may become final,\u201d and plaintiffs further prayed: \u201cthat the levies heretofore made by the Defendant herein pertaining to the collection of alleged income tax due from the Plaintiffs pertaining to the years 1945, 1946 and 1947 be declared null and void and to take such action as is necessary to release any and all of said levies and to return to Plaintiffs any and all monies collected pursuant to said illegal levies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b903-5\">The Director\u2019s motion to dismiss taxpayers\u2019 complaint for injunction was overruled by an opinion reported below as Steiner v. Reisimer, D.C.Wis.1957, 148 F.Supp. 192, in which the district judge concluded there was jurisdiction under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6213(a), and that 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7421 would not, under the relevant facts, bar injunctive relief. After his motion was denied the Director filed an answer to the complaint and taxpayers moved for summary judgment, supporting their motion with affidavits. Counter-affidavits were interposed by the Director who has appealed from the order of summary judgment for taxpayers entered July 10, 1957, as well as from an order refusing amendment of the order granting permanent injunction.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b903-9\">Exhibits \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d, attached to the complaint, are two U. S. Treasury Department Forms 870M. It is undisputed that Harold G. Steiner signed Exhibit A and he and his wife each, respectively, signed Exhibit B. Moreover, it is admitted that government conferee Steers directed the insertion of typewritten paragraphs, indicated below, on these forms before they were mailed out to these taxpayers. For convenience we show a composite of these two exhibits since they are identical save for the lines indicated \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-10\">\u201cIn re: Harold G.

To aid its contention that summary judgment under Rule 56, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C., was improper, the Director refers to various factual questions he claims roam widely over the intellectual terrain objectified by the pleadings and affidavits. Defendant\u2019s theme is summarized in his brief, at one place, by this passage: \u201cThe Director claims that under the record circumstances he is entitled to a trial and to be allowed to offer oral and written evidence to show that the waiver here was under its terms effective and the Government had evidenced sufficiently that the assessments would be in the amounts stated in the Forms 870M \u2018on the basis of the settlement hereinbefore proposed\u2019 * * at the conference between Steers and taxpayer and his representatives.\u201d But this ignores one of the outstanding aspects of the case and dominating the proceedings below when the following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b905-6\">\u201cThe Court: Wait a minute. We are talking about the authority of the District Director or his nominees to accept, and what I am trying to get from you is what issue of fact is there on that as opposed to legal questions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b905-7\">\u201cMr. Dealy [Counsel for Defendant] : Well, your honor, the fact is, as I see it, whether or not the authority has been delegated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b905-8\">\u201cThe Court: All right. Isn\u2019t that a legal question? You are relying upon statutes\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b905-9\">\u201cMr. Dealy: And regulations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b905-10\">\u201cThe Court: And there is no testimony that you could offer over and above that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b905-11\">\u201cMr. Dealy: That is probably true, your honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b905-13\">\u201cThe Court: You will stand on the statutes and regulations?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b905-14\">\u201cMr. Dealy: That is right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b905-4\">\u201cThe Court: That\u2019s a legal question, isn\u2019t it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b905-16\">\u201cMr.'Dealy: The testimony, however, could cover the procedures of the Service and what is done and generally relied upon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b905-17\">\u201cThe Court: Now, wait a minute. If the Service customarily does something that\u2019s illegal, that doesn\u2019t make it legal, the fact that they do it. If the Service does something that the law doesn\u2019t permit them to do, doesn\u2019t give them power to do, that\u2019s a nullity. We can't decide a case on the basis of that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b905-18\">\u201cMr. Dealy: I believe, your hon- or, the law has long held that long standing custom of operations, and especially of administrative agencies, can be sanctioned by the Commissioner if not specifically changed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b905-19\">\u201cThe Court: Of interpretation. You can\u2019t do something that\u2019s illegal and make it legal by doing it, can you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b905-20\">\u201cMr. Dealy: We have had no showing here, your honor, from the taxpayer that this is illegal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b905-22\">\u201cThe Court: Getting back to the question of whether you have any fact issue on that question,\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b905-23\">\u201cMr. Dealy: If your honor wishes to treat it as a legal issue, the Government will abide by that decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b905-24\">\u201cThe Court: I am asking you for your help. I can\u2019t see any question of fact on it, and I don\u2019t want to be wrong. If there is an issue of fact on it, I want to know on that one narrow point.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b905-25\">\u201cMr. Dealy: It will probably be decided, your honor, by reference to the law and the regulations. However, if your honor desires testimony to be enlightened as to the procedure and practice of the Service, we can produce that testimony in greater length than we have in our affidavits here, and certainly in greater length as to the general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>practice as well as the specific practice in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b906-4\">\u201cThe Court: That would be merely testimony to enable the court to construe the statute or regulations?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b906-5\">\u201cMr. Dealy: That\u2019s right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b906-6\">\u201cThe Court: And still be a legal question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b906-7\">\u201cMr. Dealy: All right, your hon- or; and whether the notice sent to the taxpayers constituted an acceptance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b906-8\">Rule 56 received detailed consideration in our opinion reported as Homan Mfg. Co. v. Long, 7 Cir., 1957, 242 F.2d 645, 653, and what was said there, in this passage, is obviously apposite here: \u201cSummary judgment procedure enables district judges to nip in the bud litigation which would wilt, if the case went forward to a trial on the merits, because there was no genuine issue as to any material fact.\u201d The authorities, Campana Corp. v. Harrison, 7 Cir., 1943, 135 F.2d 334, and Sarkes Tarzian, Inc. v. United States, 7 Cir., 1957, 240 F.2d 467, pressed on us by defendant are inapposite because the record before us is devoid of a \u201cgenuine issue as to any material fact.\u201d The question below pivoted on power and authority to accept Forms 870M and that issue obstinately resists attempts at classifying it as one of fact under Rule 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-9\">Since there has been no acceptance by the Commissioner these taxpayers\u2019 signatures on Forms 870M did not relieve the taxing officials of their statutory obligation to give plaintiffs notice before assessment and collection. From this it follows that the district court could, and properly did, bring its equity powers into play despite \u00a7 7421. See Homan Mfg. Co. v. Long, 7 Cir., 1957, 242 F.2d 645, 651. Such notice is a condition precedent, and its absence invalidates the assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-10\">While no formal refund claim had been filed by these taxpayers the district court did allow judgment for a refund of all monies and property collected under the challenged levies and assessments. The point was raised on appeal for the first time, and that is enough for disregarding it now. Of course, the refund flowed as a result of invalidating the assessment and that cuts ground from the belated point urged on appeal by the Director,</p>\n<p id=\"b906-12\">The judgment orders appealed are affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b902-9\">.

If in the case of any taxpayer, the Commissioner determines that there is a deficiency in respect of the tax imposed by this chapter, the Commissioner is authorized to send notice of such deficiency to the taxpayer by registered mail. Within ninety days after such notice is mailed (not counting Saturday, Sunday, or a legal holiday in the District of Columbia as the ninetieth day) the taxpayer may file a petition with The Tax Court * * * for a rede-termination of the deficiency. No assessment of a deficiency in respect of the tax imposed by this chapter and no dis-traint or proceeding in court for its collection shall be made, begun, or prosecuted until such notice has been mailed to the taxpayer, nor until the expiration of such ninety-day period, nor, if a petition has been filed with the Board, until the decision of the Tax Court has become final. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 3653(a) the making of such assessment or the beginning of such proceeding or distraint during the time-such prohibition is in force may be enjoined by a proceeding in the proper court. In the case of a joint return filed: by husband and wife such notice of deficiency may be a single joint notice, except that if the Commissioner has beem notified by either spouse that separate-residences have been established, then, in lieu of the single joint notice, duplicate-originals of the joint notice must be sent by registered mail to each spouse at his-last known address * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b902-18\">\u201c(d) Waiver of Restrictions.
