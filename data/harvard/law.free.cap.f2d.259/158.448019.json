The motion presents the question whether we have power \u2014 prior to deciding whether a petitioner shall be allowed to appeal in forma pauperis \u2014 to direct the preparation of a trial transcript at the expense of the United States. The Government contends that we have no such power.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Counsel for petitioner argues that a transcript is necessary to enable him to present to this court an adequate memorandum in support of the petition for leave to appeal in forma pauperis. Petitioner is a person \u201callowed to * * * defend * * * in forma pauperis\u201d in the District Court, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 753(f) (1952); he was defended by assigned counsel, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915 (d) (1952); Fed.R.Cnm.P. 44, 18 U.S.C.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-17\">After trial by jury in the District Court, Whitt was convicted of narcotics violations and was sentenced to prison on November 8, 1957. He made timely application to that court for leave to appeal in forma pauperis. Leave to appeal was denied, with \u201ccounsel of record * * * [and] with defendant present, in open Court, and upon a showing of counsel that there was no substantial question of law present, and on the Court\u2019s own finding that there was no substantial question of law.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> No \u201cbad faith certificate\u201d was entered. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a). Whitt then, <em>pro se, </em>sought leave from this court to appeal in forma pauperis. We appointed counsel for Whitt and held the petition in abeyance, directing counsel to file a memorandum in support of the petition. On March 13, 1958, counsel filed the instant motion, alleging in reply to the Government\u2019s opposition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-18\">\u201cWhat the Government actually opposes in its Opposition herein is a fair distribution of the burden and duty cast upon all of us where a petitioner files an appeal * * *. Normally it might be possible to prepare the record and certify error from an agreed statement through the trial judge. This is not possible in the instant case [since the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>judge is now deceased]. The only \u2018avenue\u2019 of escape from petitioner\u2019s motion \u2014 suggested by the Government \u2014 is for assigned counsel to sit down with the Court reporter, go over the prolonged trial, take notes of possible error and then attempt (if possible) to prepare an agreed statement. It should be recalled that we, as assigned counsel in this Court, are wholly unfamiliar with the record. We would need to comb it in its entirety for possible error in order to answer the question on this appeal \u2014 whether the application to appeal is in good faith or presents a substantial question. In fairness to petitioner, we could not even rely on petitioner\u2019s or his [trial] counsel\u2019s recollection, for they may have missed the kind of error which was so prejudicial that this Court must take notice of it. Even if the recollection of either petitioner or his trial counsel might be referred to, the dispute as to what occurred is apparently in such conflict and the charges against trial counsel so serious, that in our opinion, petitioner\u2019s appeal could not be properly presented to this Court without the transcript. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">The issue is thus whether we have power to provide a trial transcript<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> at Government expense to one who is admittedly a pauper, who has defended at trial in forma pauperis, but who has not yet been allowed to appeal to this court in forma pauperis. The relevant statute, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 753(f), provides in part:<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"AXf\">\u201cFees for transcripts furnished in criminal or habeas corpus proceedings to persons allowed to sue, defend, or appeal in forma pauperis shall be paid by the United States * # -K <em>\u00bb&gt;</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-12\">Authoritative guidance on the subject was given by the Supreme Court in Johnson v. United States, 1957, 352 U.S. 565, 77 S.Ct. 550, 1 L.Ed.2d 593, a case which was presented to the Court in precisely the same posture as the instant case is presented to us.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Court said, 352 U.S. at page 566, 77 S.Ct. at page 551:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-13\">\u201cFinally, either the defendant or his assigned counsel must be enabled to show that the grounds for seeking an appeal from the judgment of conviction are not frivolous and do not justify the finding [by the District Court] that the appeal is not sought in good faith. This does not require that in every such case the United States must furnish the defendant with a stenographic transcript of the trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-14\">See also Farley v. United States, 1957, 354 U.S. 521, 77 S.Ct. 1371, 1 L.Ed.2d 1529; Edwards v. United States, 1957, 355 U.S. 36, 78 S.Ct. 124, 2 L.Ed.2d 72. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>Clearly the Court implied that in some \u201csuch case\u201d provision of a transcript would be appropriate or even necessary.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> And this court has frequently exercised its power to order transcripts prior to determining whether to allow an appeal <em>in forma </em>pauperis<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">We think the statutory language necessarily contemplates that persons who have been allowed to defend in forma pauperis may be provided with free transcripts. It is true that Section 753(f), supra note 4, merely authorizes payment to court reporters for certain transcripts prepared by them. Neither that section nor any other, in so many words, particularizes the situations in which a court in a criminal case can properly direct preparation of a transcript at Government expense. But one such proper situation, implicit in the language of Section 753(f), is where the petitioner has been allowed to \u201cdefend * * * in forma pauperis.\u201d This expression must include not only those cases in which the District Court has entered an explicit order to that effect, but those in which the court has simply appointed counsel to represent an indigent defendant, without the formality of stating that the defense is to be in forma pauperis. To decide otherwise, in the light of the legislative history of the Court Reporters Act,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> would leave the word \u201cdefend\u201d with little or no content in that context. We hold that the statute gives the District Court and this court authority under appropriate circumstances to direct the preparation of transcripts at Government expense at this stage of the proceedings.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b209-15\"> But a trial defense in forma pauperis does not, <em>ipso facto </em>and without more, entitle a petitioner to a transcript as of right. We must be satisfied that, in the factual setting of the particular case, provision of a transcript is appropriate as a means of making manifest the basis of the claim of error. Johnson v. United States, supra. Working time of appointed counsel, United States Attorneys, judges, witnesses, and court reporters is valuable and must be considered ;<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the nature of the crime, the type or length of the trial, or the character of the suggestions of error presented are also relevant. In some cases the preparation of a transcript at Government expense may not be appropriate, and the expense may therefore be unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-16\">This court requires an adequate record on which to base a decision whether to grant or deny leave to appeal in forma pauperis. That record should be made available to us as promptly as cir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>cumstances permit. Neither unwarranted delay in the preparation of the record nor poverty should stand as a roadblock to the proper and expeditious determination of criminal appeals. See Griffin v. People of the State of Illinois, 1956, 351 U.S. 12, 76 S.Ct. 585, 100 L.Ed. 891; Ward v. United States, 1956, 76 S.Ct. 1063, 1 L.Ed.2d 25, 28-29 (per Frankfurter, Circuit Justice); Fed.R.Crim.P. 39(d); Rule 33 of the General Rules of this Court, 28 U.S.C.A.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">In the instant case, petitioner has shown that the balance of convenience weighs heavily in favor of ordering the transcript, particularly in view of the death of the trial judge. In addition to the allegations of present counsel, petitioner, <em>pro se, </em>alleges that the trial court failed to instruct the jury on the manner in which they were to evaluate informer testimony, although such an instruction was appropriate. Present counsel informs this court that trial counsel is uncertain whether such an instruction was given. Also, petitioner claims that the trial judge\u2019s instruction on petitioner\u2019s entrapment defense was inadequate. Proper presentation and resolution of these questions will depend on whether, in fact, the informer instruction was warranted by the evidence and, .if so, whether such an instruction was requested, and whether it was given and given properly; the same is true in regard to the entrapment instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">Under these circumstances, and having regard to the factors which must control our judgment, we have directed preparation of the trial transcript in this case at the expense of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">While it may be unnecessary to our decision in this case, we think it proper to add that in our view the recent decisions of the Supreme Court in Johnson, Farley, Edwards, and Ellis, cited above, mean that in at least some criminal cases there may be a constitutional right to full review. See Note, 58 Col.L.Rev. 832 at 848 (1958). In such a case, failure of the Government promptly to supply a transcript upon order of the court would mean that the court would be under the necessity of considering whether or not such failure required the reversal of the conviction and the ordering of a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b207-11\">. Although the Government does say: \u201cIf necessary, the District Court could order a transcript by authority granted that court under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 753(f) to order such transcripts without expense to the government.\u201d Presumably the Government is referring to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 753(b) par. 3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b207-13\">. We may note, parenthetically, that the DI triet Court appears to have applied an incorrect standard in dealing with the situation before it. In Ellis v. United States, 356 U.S. 674, 675, 78 S.Ct. 974, 975, the Supreme Court said: \u201cThe only statutory requirement for the allowance of an indigent\u2019s appeal is the applicant\u2019s \u2018good faith.\u2019 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915, [28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1915], In the absence of some evident improper motive, the applicant\u2019s good faith is established by the presentation of any issue that is not plainly frivolous. Farley v. United States, 354 U.S. 521, 77 S.Ct. 1371, .1 L.Ed.2d 1529. The good-faith test must not be-converted into a requirement of a preliminary showing of any particular degree of merit. Unless the issues raised are so frivolous that the appeal would be dismissed in the case of a non-indigent litigant, Fed.itules Crim.Proc. 39(a), [18-U.S.C.A.], the request of an indigent for leave to appeal <em>in forma pauperis </em>must be allowed.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b208-7\">. It should be noted that in every case a defendant has access to the transcript of \u201call pleas and proceedings in connecnection with the imposition of sentence.\u201d Poole v. United States, 1957, 102 U.S. App.D.C. 71, 250 F.2d 396; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 753(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b208-8\">. The full text of Section 753(f) provides :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-9\">\u201c(f) Each reporter may charge and collect fees for transcripts requested by the parties, including the United States, at rates prescribed by the court subject to the approval of the Judicial Conference. He shall not charge a fee for any copy of a transcript delivered to the clerk for the records of court. Fees for transcripts furnished in criminal or habeas corpus proceedings to persons allowed to sue, defend, or appeal in forma pauperis shall be paid by the United States out of money appropriated for that purpose. Poes for transcripts furnished in other proceedings to persons permitted to appeal in forma pauperis shall also be paid by the United States if the trial judge or a circuit judge certifies that the appeal is not frivolous but presents a substantial question. The reporter may require any party requesting a transcript to prepay the estimated fee in advance except as to transcripts that are to be paid for by the United States.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b208-18\">.

The Supreme Court in the Johnson case went on to say, after the passage just quoted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-7\">\u201cIt is essential, however, that he be assured some appropriate means \u2014 such as the district judge\u2019s notes or an agreed statement by trial counsel \u2014 of making manifest the basis of his claim that the District Court committed error in certifying that the desired appeal was not pursued in good faith.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">This statement goes to the matter of possible alternative remedies: it does not negative our power to provide a transcript.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b209-10\">.
