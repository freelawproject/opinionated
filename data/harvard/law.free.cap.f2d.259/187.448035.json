The question asked appellant to name the persons present with him at a meeting of \u201cCommunist writers\u201d in 1947.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The record shows the witness urged the Chairman not to press the direction to answer the question and requested him to defer it until a later time. The Chairman agreed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The hearing terminated shortly thereafter without any unequivocally renewed direction or command to answer the \u201csuspended\u201d question. Thus, the requirement of Quinn v. United States,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> that it be brought home to the witness that he risks the penalties of contempt if he refuses to answer the question, was not followed. We need not speculate why the question was not renewed before closing the hearing; it is enough that on the whole record it seems clear that appellant had a right to leave the hearing thinking that the direction to answer was still suspended, if not abandoned. The Chairman\u2019s closing statement to appellant, while not determinative, is consistent with our reading of the record:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-14\">\u201cThe Chairman. You have learned a great deal and made a greater contribution to what we think you now stand for than you realize, because, by the errors that you committed, you are serving a very loud note of warning to a lot of other people who might fall into what you did, quite obviously.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-15\">\u201cThe committee is now adjourned.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b236-16\">Appellant has raised other points, including the argument that the question was not pertinent in fact, and that explanation of pertinency was not given as required by Watkins v. United States.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> However, the absence of a direction to answer as required by the Quinn case makes it unnecessary to reach these contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-17\">Reversed with directions to enter a judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b236-9\">. \u201cCan you tell us who was there when you walked into the room?\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b236-10\">. \u201cMr. Miller. Mr. Walter, could I ask <em>you4 </em>to postpone this question until the testimony is completed and you can gage [sic] for yourself?</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-11\">\u201cThe Chairman. Of course, you can do that, but I understand this is about the end of the hearing.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b236-18\">. 1955, 349 U.S. 155, 75 S.Ct. 668, 99 U.Ed. 964, see also United States v.
