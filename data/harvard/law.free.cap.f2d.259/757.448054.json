Specifically, the articles dealt with here were baby bottle warmers, which were designed to operate from the cigarette lighter outlet on an automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-13\">Aran, doing business as \u201cAuto Nurse Manufacturing Company,\u201d made and sold baby bottle warmers fitted with a cord and connection capable of being inserted into the cigarette lighter, with which automobiles are generally equipped. These bottle warmers are primarily used by parents with infant children, and are sold in baby, drug and department stores under the advertised name of \u201cAuto Nurse.\u201d Aran printed on his business stationery a picture of an automobile with the slogan, \u201cAuto Nurse warms Baby\u2019s food \u2014 on the Go!\u201d There was no method by which the \u201cAuto Nurse\u201d could warm a bottle for the baby except when attached to an automobile, unless a converter could have-been obtained to adapt the device for.attachment on ordinary electric outlets.. Aran did not even manufacture such a. converter.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-16\">From May 31,1949, through November-17, 1954, Aran made payments of manufacturers\u2019 excise tax on the sale of the-baby bottle warmers.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-17\">On February 4, 1955, in response to a-, request, the Treasury Department ruled-by letter that the bottle was not subject, to the manufacturers\u2019 excise tax. On. February 14, 1955, Aran filed his claim-for refund. By letter dated December-8, 1955, the Treasury Department notified Aran that further consideration had' been given and the previous ruling was. reversed. Subsequently, the claim was disallowed, and this action for refund\u2019 was filed in the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-18\">Based upon a stipulation and testimony, the District Court entered judgment against Aran, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-19\"> The evidence did not prove that, there was a long and consistent administrative practice which established a., construction by those officials charged, with the collection of the excise tax. The interpretation of the statute was. favorable to Aran at first, but reversed-ten months later. The construction ins <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>favor of liability has support in other regulations and rulings upon like articles.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Under such circumstance, the administrative officials are empowered to change a ruling.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">The question is one of construction of the statute in the first instance.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The language can be interpreted rationally to include devices not essential to the operation or use of an automobile. The interpretation by the Treasury regulations include as a part or accessory \u201cany article the primary use of which is in connection with such vehicle or article [automobile chassis or body] whether or not essential to its operation or use.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> There is no difficulty in construing the language of the enactment. The fact that all possible parts and accessories were not enumerated in the enactment itself constitutes no test. Improvements and new accessories are constantly being brought on the market. In Universal Battery Company v. United States, 281 U.S. 580, 584, 50 S.Ct. 422, 423, <em>74 </em>L.Ed. 1051, it is said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-6\">\u201cWe think the view taken in the administrative regulations is reasonable and should be upheld. It is that articles primarily adapted for use in motor vehicles are to be regarded as parts or accessories of such vehicles, even though there has been some other use of the articles for which they are not so well adapted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b807-14\">There are questions of fact: (1) whether it is an article used in connection with an automobile; (2) whether it is primarily so used; and ultimately (3) whether it constitutes a part or accessory.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The trial court made findings against the taxpayer and for the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-16\">This Court has affirmed a District Court in holding that seatcovers for automobiles are \u201cparts or accessories\u201d subject to tax under this section.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It was there argued that seatcovers could be put to other uses and that these articles, although primarily for use in connection with an automobile, were not essential for the operation or use thereof. It was also argued that the seatcovers were primarily for the comfort and convenience of the passengers. Although this question of fact as to seatcovers was determined by the trial court in the Hirasuna case and affirmed here, that opinion does not foreclose our examination of a different question of fact in the instant case. The trial judge in this case has, however, arrived at a like conclusion upon the different set of facts presented by this record. This circumstance is highly persuasive. Furthermore, the findings are to be accepted by this Court generally unless clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-17\">While it is true that the intention of the manufacturer might not be controlling in a case where the article is pri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>marily used as a part or accessory, still the fact that here the manufacturer designed, advertised and sold the article primarily for such use has heavy weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b806-14\">.
