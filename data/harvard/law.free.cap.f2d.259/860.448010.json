In each of these years Country Home showed a substantial loss, and at the end of 1939 its publication was discontinued. A substantial saving in petitioner\u2019s annual expenses was achieved thereby.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-11\">Prior to the year 1936 petitioner used the letter-press method for printing its magazines. During the years 1936 through 1939 it changed to a substantial degree to the gravure method of printing. This change effected a considerable saving.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-12\">In February of 1952 the Commissioner of Internal Revenue assessed a deficiency in petitioner\u2019s excess profits tax liability for the years 1943 through 1945 totaling $1,866,250.35. Petitioner filed with the Tax Court a petition for revision claiming an over-assessment for those years.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-14\">In the Tax Court petitioner raised several issues:</p>\n<p id=\"b909-15\">1. Whether petitioner was entitled to relief under \u00a7 722(b) (4) of the 1939 Code, 26 U.S.C.A. Excess Profits Taxes, \u00a7 722(b) (4), on the ground that its average base period net income was an inadequate standard of normal earnings because of the discontinuance at the end of the base period of its unprofitable magazine, Country Home.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-16\">2. Whether petitioner was entitled to relief under \u00a7 722(b) (4) on the ground that its average base period net income was an inadequate standard of normal earnings because of savings it realized due to changes which it made during the base period from the letter-press method of printing to a substantial use of the high-speed multicolor gravure method of printing.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-17\">3. Questioning the determination of petitioner\u2019s adjusted (\u201cconstructive\u201d) average base period net income resulting from both or either of the qualifying factors set forth above.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-18\">4. Whether petitioner is entitled under \u00a7 721 of the Code, 26 U.S.C.A. Excess Profits Taxes, \u00a7 721, to eliminate abnormal income resulting from gravure research and development.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-19\">5. Whether petitioner is entitled under \u00a7 711 of the Code to eliminate certain abnormal expenses incurred during the base period.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-20\">To the first, second and third questions the Tax Court answered in favor of petitioner and held that petitioner\u2019s income average for the applicable base period should be adjusted upwards by $518,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-21\">As to the fourth and fifth issues the Tax Court held for the Commissioner. The Court found that petitioner had not incurred research and development costs entitling it to relief under \u00a7 721. As to the fifth issue the Tax Court held that the expenses which petitioner sought to eliminate from the computation of the base period were not of \u201cabnormal\u201d nature within the purview of \u00a7 711.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>On appeal to this court petitioner raises the following questions:</p>\n<p id=\"b910-4\">1. Whether in determining the amount of relief from excess profits taxes under \u00a7 722(b) (4) the Tax Court acted arbitrarily in th\u00e1t it allowed an amount of relief which was inconsistent with the court\u2019s specific findings of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-5\">2. Whether the Tax Court erred in (holding that a certain portion of the expenses allocated to Country Home magazine would have continued after cessation \u25a0of its publication.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-6\">8. Whether the Tax Court erred in \u25a0concluding that the taxpayer was not entitled to any relief under \u00a7 721 with re.spect to \u201cabnormal\u201d income allegedly received during the taxable year as the result of expenditures made during the \"base period years for research and development in the art of gravure printing.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-7\">4. Whether the Tax Court erred in \u2022failing to include in its decision specific \u25a0 determinations of an over-assessment of income tax for the year 1942, and an over-assessment in declared value excess profits taxes for 1944 where no deficiency with respect to those two taxes had been determined by the Commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-9\">5. Whether the Tax Court in determining the amount of relief granted to the taxpayer under \u00a7 722 erred in using the so-called \u201cvariable credit rule\u201d contained in respondent\u2019s regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-10\">6. Whether the Tax Court erred in \u25a0 concluding that the taxpayer was not entitled to any relief under \u00a7 711(b) (1) (J) for certain \u201cabnormal deductions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b910-12\">Other issues raised by petitioner have been conceded by respondent and will not be considered here.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-13\">The Excess Profits Tax Act of 1940 (\u00a7 201 of the Second Revenue Act of 1940, c. 757, 54 Stat. 974) 26 U.S.C.A. Excess Profits Taxes, \u00a7 710 et seq., imposed an excess profits tax upon certain \u2022 corporations for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1939. The tax was imposed on net income (modified by certain adjustments) in excess of a specific \u2022exemption of $5,000, and a norm or standard referred to as \u201cthe excess profits credit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b910-15\">In computing its tax the petitioner used what is referred to as the \u201caverage income method.\u201d This method provides for the computation of the general average of the excess profits net income for taxable years beginning with the four base period years of 1936 to 1939 inclusive. The excess profits credit is 95% of such base period average income.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-16\">The 1940 Act contained two relief provisions: \u00a7 721 and \u00a7 722 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939. \u00a7 721 provided relief for corporations which had received abnormal income in an excess profits tax year if the taxpayer could demonstrate that such abnormal income was attributable to events in other taxable years. The abnormal income was defined to mean income of exceptional type or magnitude which the taxpayer did not usually receive. If items of abnormal income could be attributed to other years in the light of the events in which such items had their origin, such abnormal income was pushed back or forward to such other years.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-17\">Code \u00a7 722, on the other hand, provided relief when the abnormalities were in the base period, either in form of low income or high deductions arising from certain specific causes. The section permits taxpayers to increase their excess profits credit by upward adjustments of their average base period net income to compensate for changes in the character of business occurring before January 1, 1940. Sec. 722 applies when the taxpayer can demonstrate that if certain changes in his business which occurred towards the end of the base period had occurred at the beginning of such period the average income level used to compute the excess profits tax credit would have been larger than the averagq income actually realized.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-18\">By its petition for review the taxpayer is endeavoring to present to this court on appeal issues decided by the Tax Court with respect to taxpayer\u2019s right to relief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>under the two \u201cabnormalities\u201d sections described above as well as \u00a7 711(b) (1) (J) of the 1939 Code in regard to its excess profits tax liability for the taxable years in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-4\">At the outset respondent challenges this court\u2019s jurisdiction to review the decision of the Tax Court with respect to the taxpayer\u2019s right to relief under \u00a7 722, \u00a7 721 or \u00a7 711(b) (1) (J). In this, respondent relies on \u00a7 732(c) which provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b911-5\">\u201c(c) <em>Finality of determination. </em>If in the determination of the tax liability under this subchapter the determination of any question is necessary solely by reason of section 711(b) (1) * * * (J) * * *, section 721 or section 722, the determination of such question shall not be reviewed or redetermined by any court or agency except the Tax Court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b911-7\">In an effort to avoid the effect of the prohibition of review contained in \u00a7 732 (c) the taxpayer in its petition seeking review has asserted jurisdiction under \u00a7 7482 and \u00a7 7483 of the 1954 Code, 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 7482, 7483.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The taxpayer offers no explanation in support of its assertion of jurisdiction under these sections. Its contention must be that the enactment of the 1954 Code operates to confer jurisdiction upon this court to review decisions of the Tax Court on \u201cabnormalities\u201d issues, apparently upon the theory that the 1954 Code repealed the prohibition against such reviews contained in \u00a7 732(c) of the 1939 Code. However, neither the text nor the legislative history of \u00a7 7482 and \u00a7 7483 sustains the taxpayer\u2019s contention, but rather they show that \u00a7 732(c) still applies with respect to review of World War II excess profits tax relief proceedings. See Brown Paper Mill Co., Inc., v. Commissioner, 5 Cir., 255 F.2d 77.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-8\">Inasmuch as \u00a7 732(c) expressly and without any exception or qualification prohibits any review or redetermination by any court other than the Tax Court of any question \u201csolely by reason of\u201d \u00a7 722, \u00a7 721 or \u00a7 711(b) (1) (J) or (K) \u2014 the \u201cabnormalities\u201d provisions of the Excess Profits Tax Act \u2014 this court must decline to entertain the taxpayer\u2019s petition for review in this proceeding, and dismiss the appeal insofar as it relates to the questions arising and determined under those sections. The causes in which appellate courts have entertained reviews involving \u201cabnormalities\u201d fall into two categories. One comprises the so-called \u201cstandard issues.\u201d These are cases in which the Tax Court had decided that it had no jurisdiction to entertain \u201cstandard issues\u201d in such a proceeding. See Martin Weiner Corporation v. Commissioner, 2 Cir., 1955, 223 F.2d 444; Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Blue Diamond Coal Co., 6 Cir., 1956, 230 F.2d 312; Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. S. Frieder &amp; Sons Co., 3 Cir., 1955, 228 F.2d 478; Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Seminole Manufacturing Co., 5 Cir., 1956, 233 F.2d 395, and cases cited therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-11\">The second category of cases in which appellate courts have reviewed a determination of the Tax Court on \u201cabnormalities\u201d issues involves what may be called \u201ccombination questions.\u201d The Tax Court\u2019s decisions were reviewed because-they were regarded as presenting determinations turning on other provisions in. addition to the \u201cabnormalities\u201d sections.. See Dowd-Feder, Inc., v. Commissioner, 6 Cir., 1949, 173 F.2d 673; Dayton Rubber Co. v. Commissioner, 6 Cir., 1957, 249 F.2d 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-13\">The present petition does not seek review of questions falling within either of these two categories. In particular, the questions could not be regarded as falling in the category of \u201ccombination questions.\u201d Each of the \u201cabnormalities\u201d questions presented here was decided by the Tax Court exclusively and solely by reason of \u00a7 721, \u00a7 722. or \u00a7 711(b) (1) (J). In these circumstances \u00a7 732(c) of the 1939 Code prohibits us from reviewing the Tax Court\u2019s de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>termination. And it makes no difference that both questions of law and of fact may be involved if the determination of the Tax Court is solely by reason of the \u201cabnormalities\u201d provisions. See George Kemp Real Estate Co. v. Commissioner, 2 Cir., 1950, 182 F.2d 847.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-4\">In its petition for review the taxpayer alleges that the Tax Court erred in failing to include in its decision specific determinations of an over-assessment of income tax for the year 1942 and an over-assessment in declared value excess-profits taxes for 1944, even if no deficiency with respect to those two taxes had been determined by the Commissioner. On this point respondent concedes the jurisdiction of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-5\">However, in the notice to the petitioner, the Commissioner found an over-assessment of income tax and declared value excess-profits tax for the years 1942 and 1944. Petitioner did not file a formal claim for refund with respect to those years. Nevertheless, petitioner now urges that the Tax Court erred in not finding an over-assessment with respect to those years.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-6\">On this point petitioner relies on \u00a7 6512(b) (1) <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of the 1954 Code, 26 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 6512(b) (1), which provides as far as relevant here that whenever there is a deficiency of income tax before the Tax Court for' a given year, that court must find the correct income tax liability whether it results in a greater deficiency or an over-assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-7\">Undoubtedly the Tax Court has the power to redetermine the correct tax to the extent that its jurisdiction has been properly invoked, whether such re-determination results in a deficiency or an over-assessment. See Old Colony Trust Co. v. Commissioner, 1928, 279 U. S. 716, 49 S.Ct. 499, 73 L.Ed. 918. But the taxpayer can invoke the jurisdiction of the Tax Court only when the Commissioner has determined a deficiency. See \u00a7\u00a7 6212 and 6213 of the 1954 Code, 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 6212, 6213; Uncasvill Mfg. Co. v. Commissioner, 2 Cir., 1932, 55 F.2d 893. The Tax Court\u2019s authority to find an overpayment applies to taxes of the same kind with respect to which a deficiency has been determined by the Commissioner. This court has held that on petition to the Tax Court to review a determination of a deficiency in ordinary income taxes the Tax Court was without \u2022jurisdiction 'to redetermine taxpayer\u2019s excess profits taxes with respect to which no deficiency had been determined. Su-perheater Co. v. Commissioner, 2 Cir., 1942, 125 F.2d 514. The holding of this case is controlling here.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-10\">In its petition for review the taxpayer contends, in computing the amount of relief under \u00a7 722, that the Tax Court erred by applying the so-called \u201cvariable credit rule\u201d contained in Regulations 112, 35.722-3(d) (5).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It is petitioner\u2019s position that this rule is not based on the statute and therefore is unconstitutional. The petitioner, however, neither in its brief nor on the argument sustained that position.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-11\">Sec. 722(a) provides that in computing the constructive average base period income of a taxpayer no regard shall be had to changes occurring after the base period and during excess profits tax years unless such changes are the result of a program to which the taxpayer was committed during the base period. The Regulations implement this by providing that where increased earnings in an excess profits tax year are due to the expansion to which the taxpayer had committed itself during the base period, the extent to which the change in the capacity for production actually entered into the business of the taxpayer in such excess profits tax year shall be the extent to which a change in the productive capacity is deemed to have existed in December 1939. Thus, if not full but only part productive capacity was attained in any one profit year, only part productive capacity would be allowed in computing taxpayer\u2019s constructive income during the base period.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-12\">Petitioner contends that in computing constructive income, full productive ca<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>pacity should be allowed, whether such full capacity was actually attained during the excess profits tax year. Any other rule, says petitioner, would be unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-4\">The variable credit rule contained in the Regulations has been in effect for many years. It has been applied when appropriate upon the facts in numerous cases before the Tax Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-5\">Nielsen Lithographing Co. v. Commissioner, 19 T.C. 605;</p>\n<p id=\"b913-6\">Southern California Edison Co. v. Commissioner, 19 T.C. 935;</p>\n<p id=\"b913-7\">Yeast Products, Inc., v. Commissioner, 21 T.C. 308;</p>\n<p id=\"b913-8\">Lily Mills Co. v. Commissioner, 21 T.C. 900;</p>\n<p id=\"b913-9\">Springfield Tablet Manufacturing Co. v. Commissioner, 22 T.C. 35;</p>\n<p id=\"b913-10\">Journal-Tribune Publishing Co. v. Commissioner, 24 T.C. 1048;</p>\n<p id=\"b913-11\">R. J. M. Co. v. Commissioner, 24 T.C. 1032;</p>\n<p id=\"b913-12\">Hydraulic Press Manufacturing Co. v. Commissioner, 27 T.C. 278.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-13\">These Regulations set forth a reasonable rule for adjusting the taxpayer\u2019s constructive income average on the basis of production levels actually attained. Petitioner in effect seeks to strike down a reasonable rule and to substitute a rule for adjusting constructive income average without reference to reality but merely on a hypothetical productive capacity \u2014 even though subsequent events prove the hypothesis incorrect. This we cannot do. See Mutual Shoe Co. v. Commissioner, 1 Cir., 1956, 238 F.2d 729, 734, and Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. South Texas Co., 1947, 333 U.S. 496, 501, 68 S.Ct. 695, 92 L.Ed. 831.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-14\">The decision of the Tax Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-15\">Appendix</p>\n<p id=\"b913-16\">(A) \"\u00a7 7482.
