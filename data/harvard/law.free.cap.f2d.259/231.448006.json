The alleged transferor is Mrs. Marie Elizabeth Moran, widow of Daniel J. Moran.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Marie is alleged to have made gifts of her share of her community property by \u201cacquiescing\u201d in the benefits of three trusts \u2014 an insurance trust, a living trust, and a testamentary trust \u2014 established by her husband.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b283-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>I. The Three Trusts.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">Daniel James Moran and Marie Elizabeth Moran were maried before 1922 and remained husband and wife until Daniel died April 3, 1948. Their legal domicile was Texas during their entire married life. Daniel had no separate property.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">November 2, 1928, in New York, Daniel created a living trust, naming as trustee, The Equitable Trust Company, a predecessor to Chase. The trust estate consisted of securities belonging to the community. Income was payable to Daniel for life, then to Marie for life, with the remainder to the settlor\u2019s descendants. Daniel reserved the right to modify or revoke the trust. He reserved no powers of control over the administration of the trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">November 2, 1928 Daniel also created an insurance trust with the same trustee. The trust estate consisted of insurance policies on Daniel\u2019s life. Daniel paid the insurance premiums with community funds. He reserved the right to modify or revoke the trust; and under the policies he had the right to change the beneficiaries. Upon Daniel\u2019s death the insurance proceeds were payable to the trustee. Income was payable to Marie for life, with the remainder to the set-tlor\u2019s descendants. The insurance trust agreement provides that the validity and effect of the trust shall be governed by the law of New York; the living trust instrument contains a similar provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">Daniel\u2019s will provided for a testamentary trust of his residuary estate, Marie to receive the income for life, the remainder to be divided among Daniel\u2019s descendants. Chase, the trustee, was given broad discretionary power to distribute principal to any beneficiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-13\">II. Conflicting Contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-14\">A. The Commissioner held that on Daniel\u2019s death the living trust and insurance trust became irrevocable and the testamentary trust came into being. (1) As to the testamentary trust, the Commissioner took the position that Marie was put to an election under Daniel\u2019s will and that she elected to take under the will, relinquishing her half of the community for a life estate in that half. (2) As to the living trust, the Commissioner held that it became a completed gift by husband and wife when Daniel died without having exercised his right of revocation. (3) Section 86.2(a) of Treasury Regulations 108 specifically covers insurance payable revocably to a third person and purchased with community funds. The Commissioner held that on the husband\u2019s death there was a gift by the wife of one-half the amount of the proceeds of the insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-15\">The Commissioner valued the gift to each trust as the difference between what he concluded that Marie gave up (her community one-half share of the trust estate) and what she retained (a life estate in her one-half). The resulting deficiency for the three trusts amounted to $133,378.88.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This was assessed against Chase as trustee and transferee under Section 1025 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-16\">B. Chase, represented by the same New York lawyers who drew the trusts and the will,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> filed a petition in the Tax <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>Court contending that Marie had made no taxable gifts; but, if she had, that the Commissioner\u2019s measure of each gift should be reduced by the value of the life estate she received in her husband\u2019s one-half of each trust. (1) Chase\u2019s petition, filed May 22, 1953, stated that the estate was still under administration and that <em>\u201cno determination has yet been made as to whether or not the said Marie Elizabeth Moran has elected to take under the will.\u201d </em>The petition alleges however, \u201cupon information and belief\u201d, that Marie\u2019s motive <em>\u201cin not taking against </em>the will was to benefit herself\u201d and that her \u201cfailure to take against the will * * * was an arms length transaction * * * entered into by Marie upon the advice of her attorney * * * as economically advantageous\u201d. (2) As to the living trust and (3) insurance trust, Chase insisted that Marie had no community interest at the time of Daniel\u2019s death; her community interest was transferred when the trusts were created in 1928. As in the case of the testamentary trust, Chase claimed that Marie\u2019s transfers were \u201cbusiness transactions * * * for her own benefit\u201d. -</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">Marie did not join in the petition. Marie did not testify. There is no testimony in the record as to Marie\u2019s alleged \u201cmotives\u201d. There is none as to any \u201carms length\u201d negotiations between Marie and the trustee. There is no evidence as to any affirmative act by Marie showing an intention to transfer any interest to Chase. The stipulation of facts-was between Chase and the Commissioner. It has one short unenlightening paragraph referring to Marie\u2019s receipt of income from the trusts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-8\">\u201cMarie Elizabeth Moran has, since the date of decedent\u2019s death received income from each of the three trusts referred to above in accordance with the provisions of the said trust agreements and of the will of Daniel J. Moran.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b284-9\">One witness testified, briefly. Charles A. Perlitz, Executor, stated: he informed Marie that he would collect the properties in the estate and turn them over to Chase; \u201cMrs. Moran had had no experience in business matters whatever\u201d; she knew nothing about the trusts; she had never asked if she had a right to move against the trusts or the will; he did not \u2018Volunteer that she might have some right to bring suit against the trustees\u201d; \u201csomewhere down the line when I told her that she ought to make a will or someone, I think the lawyers probating the will, told her she ought to make a will, and then there was some reference there to her community interest and whether she should take on the will or not \u2014 under the will \u2014 but that was long subsequent to the time when the will had been probated\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-12\">At the trial the Commissioner and Chase agreed in assuming that Daniel\u2019s will put Marie to an election. Apparently, they agreed also that Marie\u2019s receipt of income from the trust was sufficient to show that she had elected to take under the will. They differed only as to whether the effect of the election was that she had made a taxable gift.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-13\">Chase, in its petition and at the trial, alleged that Daniel provided a trust for his wife \u201cof his entire residuary estate, <em>including the property that Marie Elizabeth Moran owned with him in community\u201d. </em>This, we must point out now, is a contradiction in terms. Daniel Moran could put his wife to an election. But Daniel Moran\u2019s residuary estate could no more include his wife\u2019s one-half of the community property than it could include Chase Manhattan\u2019s properties on Pine Street in the city of New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-14\">C. A majority of the Tax Court, held that Daniel\u2019s will put Marie to an election and that Marie\u2019s \u201cacquiescence\u201d in the testamentary trust constituted a taxable gift. The Court held that the living trust was testamentary, that Daniel gave away nothing while he lived, and the principal remained community property. When, however, Marie acquiesced in the trust by accepting the income, she thereby elected to surrender her community property interest in the principal. This, said the Court, was a taxable gift. The Tax Court agreed with Chase that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>the value of each gift was one-half of the value of the principal less the life estate in the whole. The tax deficiency was fixed at $27,426.06, plus interest amounting to $12,189.20.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">As for the insurance trust, the Tax Court held that, under the law of Texas, a surviving wife has no community property interest in the proceeds of policies payable to a third party beneficiary. Marie\u2019s failure, therefore, to assert such rights could not be treated as constituting a taxable gift. The <em>logically necessary extension of this holding would </em>re<em>quire that the entire amount of insurance proceeds be included in the gross estate of a deceased husband in Texas </em>(and perhaps in other community property states) \u2014 when a husband insures his life in favor of a trustee or other third person beneficiary, using community funds to pay the premiums, and reserving the right to change the beneficiary.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">D. Alarmed at this turn, mainly with respect to the insurance trust but also disagreeing on the valuation of the gifts of Marie\u2019s interests in the other trusts,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the Commissioner filed a motion for reconsideration. The Tax Court reaffirmed its original decision. The Commissioner appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">Chase, trustee, cross-appealed, represented by Texas attorneys.' Now, for the first time in the case, the point is made that in Texas a deceased husband\u2019s residuary estate does not include his wife\u2019s share of the community; that Daniel\u2019s will does not purport to dispose of Marie\u2019s share and therefore she was not put to an election. If Marie transferred her share to the trust, which Chase, the trustee, in this Court <em>now </em>denies, the transfer is said at most to create a revocable trust not subject to a gift tax in 1948. For various reasons, some new in the proceedings, Chase contends that Marie did not make a gift of her interest in the living trust or in the insurance trust; but, if she did, it is claimed that the value of such gift is half of the principal less her life estate in the whole. Chase is willing to agree with the Tax Court that no taxes are owed on the insurance trust. Chase asserts that its transferee liability, if any, was limited to one-half of the cash-surrender value of such policies; the taxpayer relies on two recent Supreme Court cases.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b285-11\">III. New Issue Raised on Appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-12\">The Commissioner objects to the trustee now arguing that Marie was not put to an election. The taxpayer, the Commissioner contends, is not at liberty to urge as a ground for reversal a point not raised in the court below. Indeed, says the Commissioner, the taxpayer invited error. We think that the taxpayer did invite error. Worse, the invitation was accepted. But an appellant has no vested right in an opponent\u2019s error of law in the lower court \u2014 especially when the protesting appellant is the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. The Commissioner owes a duty to the United States government to litigate zealously in the interest of collecting taxes. But he owes a duty to all taxpayers, including the litigating taxpayer, to see that the tax law is applied justly.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>We sympathize with any litigant who has filed a brief on appeal and is then confronted with his opponent\u2019s brief raising a new issue. We sympathize also with Marie, who was not represented in the Tax Court proceedings and whose interests, to our way of thinking, were in conflict with the trustee\u2019s interests. And we sympathize with taxpayers generally who may be affected adversely if, contrary to our convictions and understanding of the law, we allow an erroneous decision to go into the books and generate additional error.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">Federal procedure is moving away from what Pound calls \u201cthe sporting theory of justice\u201d, Wigmore the \u201cinstinct of giving the game fair play\u201d, and Arthur Vanderbilt the theory of procedure as \u201ca contest between two legal gladiators\u201d.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We are a Court \u201cto secure the just * * * determination of every action\u201d. Rule 1, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">Daniel\u2019s will is in the record and speaks for itsef. \u201c[Wjhere, as here, the case below was tried, not upon any misapprehension of the facts, but upon a misapprehension of the effects of those facts in law, appellant may not be prevented from pressing here for the application, to the proven facts, of the correct principles of law.\u201d Associated Indemnity Corp. v. Scott, 5 Cir., 1939, 103 F.2d 203, 209. \u201cWe see no reason why we should make what we think would be an erroneous decision, because the applicable law was not insisted upon by one of the parties.\u201d Smith Engineering Co. v. Rice, 9 Cir., 1938, 102 F.2d 492, 499. Cf. Erie v. Tompkins, 1938, 304 U.S. 64, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-10\">Tax liability as to the testamentary trust depends on whether Daniel\u2019s will put Marie to an election. The question is in the case. A just determination of the appeal requires us to decide it.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-11\">IV. The Community Property System.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-12\">For many years taxpayers in common law states, with a legitimate interest in tax uniformity, and taxpayers in community property states, with a legitimate interest in tax recognition of the realities of the community property system, were at cross purposes.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Finally, Congress enacted the equalization provisions of the Revenue Act of 1948 \u2014 to put tax<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>payers in all states on the same tax basis and at the same time recognize the logical tax effects of community property principles. It is important therefore that we weigh the issues carefully, in the interest of giving full weight to the community property law of Texas \u2014 while we give full weight to the tax laws of the United States. This takes a little doing.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">A few basic principles characterize the community property system. Their application here is determinative of the issues in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">The community property system comes from the custom of the women of the Visigoths and other Germanic tribes sharing the fighting and the spoils of war with their men; it owes its strength to the civilized view that marriage is a full partnership. Husband and wife are equal partners. Each has a present, vested half interest in all community property. All property accumulated during marriage is community property, unless it is received by gift, devise, or inheritance.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In Texas even income derived from separate property belongs to the community, including interest and dividends from separately owned securities. The husband is the manager of the community. But this management is not equivalent to ownership.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> He acts as a managing agent or trustee or managing partner of a limited partnership. The husband may sell or donate community property but not in fraud of his wife\u2019s rights.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The earnings of the husband during marriage are community, and property purchased with such earnings is also community. The wife\u2019s rights, aside from managerial control, are the same as the husband\u2019s. Thus, on death or divorce the community is divided equally. Neither spouse has testamentary disposition over the other\u2019s half of the community. The wife has complete testamentary disposition over her half and may leave it even to her paramour.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Upon the death of either spouse, a community property state levies an inheritance tax on the decedent\u2019s half of the community.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Since 1948 (and prior to 1942), only the decedent\u2019s half is includible in his gross estate for federal tax purposes.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b287-11\">V. The Testamentary Trust.</p>\n<p id=\"Ae\">Whether Marie made a taxable gift of her interest in the community to the trustee under Daniel\u2019s testamentary trust depends upon whether: (A) the will put her to an election and (B) she elected to take under the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-13\">A. If the provisions of a will require a legatee to surrender his property, or his statutory interest in property, to the executor or trustee as a condition to receiving the legacy, the legatee must make an election to take the legacy under the will or to renounce the will and preserve the rights which otherwise would be surrendered. One who accepts the benefits of the will must adopt the whole contents so far as the will con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>cerns him, and renounce every right inconsistent with it. Dunn v. Vinyard, Tex.Com.App.1923, 251 S.W. 1043; Dakan v. Dakan, 1935,125 Tex. 305, 83 S.W.2d 620; White v. Hebberd, Tex.Civ.App. 1936, 89 S.W.2d 482; State v. Jones, Tex. Civ.App.1927, 290 S.W. 244; 44 Texas Jurisprudence 285.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">Because of a long history of stoutly supporting a wife\u2019s vested ownership of half the community, Texas courts are loath to divest a widow of her share of the community on loose inferences. A study of the cases shows five major obstacles standing in the way of an election.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">(1) <em>A presumption exists that a testator intends to dispose of his property only. </em>In Whaley v. Quillin, Tex.Civ.App. 1941, 153 S.W.2d 969, 971, involving a will in which the testator left his residuary estate in trust for his wife, the court held that the will disposed of the testator\u2019s share only; that \u201cthe law presumes that no man will attempt to dispose of another\u2019s property through the instrumentality of a will * * *\u2022 the law will deprive no man of his property by conjecture\u201d. See also the leading cases of Avery v. Johnson, 1917,108 Tex. 294, 192 S.W. 542 and Ellis v. Scott, Tex.Civ.App.1933, 58 S.W.2d 194.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">(2) <em>Only where the testator\u2019s intention to dispose of property that is not his own is shown by clear and unequivocal language is a husband\u2019s will construed to devise his wife\u2019s property. </em>Pope v. Pope, Tex.Civ.App.1943, 175 S.W.2d 289. \u201cIn order that the necessity of an election shall take place, the testator must affect to dispose of property which is not his own, and also make a valid gift of his own property.\u201d McFarland v. Campbell, 5 Cir., 1954, 213 F.2d 855, 857. See also Couts v. Holland, 1908, 48 Tex.Civ.App. 476, 107 S.W. 913; Haby v. Fuos, Tex.Civ.App.1894, 25 S.W. 1121; Edds v. Edds, Tex.Civ.App.1926, 282 S.W. 638; Gibony v. Hutcheson, 1899, 20 Tex.Civ.App. 581, 50 S.W. 648.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">(3) <em>The language of the will must be susceptible of no other construction. </em>\u201c * * * [The law] deprives no man of his property merely by conjecture. * * * For a will to be given the effect of an attempted disposition of property not owned by the testator, it is required that the language of the will conclusively evidence such a purpose. In such cases it is not sufficient that the will may be construed as revealing such an intention. It is necessary that it be open to no other construction.\u201d Avery v. Johnson, 1917, 108 Tex. 294, 192 S.W. 542, 544. If a will is ambiguous as to whether a testator attempted to dispose of both halves of the community, only the testator\u2019s half passes under his will. \u201c[I]f this will should be construed to be ambiguous on the question as to whether the testator intended to bequeath the entire community estate, or merely the interest he owned therein, then the law furnishes a solution by requiring that it be given the construction that only the property owned by the testator was intended to pass thereunder.\u201d Schelb v. Sparenburg, 1939, 133 Tex. 17, 124 S.W.2d 322, 326. See also Gulf C. &amp; S. F. R. Co. v. Brandenburg, Tex.Civ.App. 1914, 167 S.W. 170.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-10\">(4) <em>Use of the first person singular pronoun shows an intention to dispose of the testator\u2019s property only. </em>In Haley v. Gatewood, 74 Tex. 281, 12 S.W. 25,. 26, the testator used the language, \u201cI will and bequeath all the estate I now own and possess\u201d. The Texas Supreme Court held: \u201cWe do not think this language indicates an intention on the part, of the testator to dispose of any part which he did not own or possess.\u201d In Sailer v. Furehe, Tex.Com.App.1930, 22 S.W.2d 1065, 1066, the same result was reached where the testator made a testamentary disposition to his wife of \u201call property, real, personal, and mixed, of which I may die seized and possessed, wherever situated\u201d. A devise of \u201cmy\u201d property is construed as referring only to. the testator\u2019s interest in the community property. Sauvage v. Wauhop, Tex.Civ.App.1912, 143 S.W. 259.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-11\">(5) <em>Finally, the will must give some benefit to replace the property surren</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number><em>dered by the election. </em>Smith v. Butler, 1892, 85 Tex. 126, 19 S.W. 1083; Packard v. De Miranda, Tex.Civ.App.1912, 146 S.W. 211.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">It is in the light of this consistent reluctance of Texas courts to base an election on uncertain inferences that Daniel\u2019s will must be examined.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">The critical language in Daniel\u2019s will creating the testamentary trust provides :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-6\">\u201cFifth: I give, devise and bequeath all of the rest, residue and remainder of the property, both real and personal, <em>which I shall own or to which I may be entitled at the time of my death </em>(hereinafter referred to as <em>my </em>\u2018residuary estate\u2019) by <em>my </em>Trustee of the residuary trust created hereby, in trust * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-7\">\u201cTenth: In the administration of <em>my </em>estate, <em>my </em>executor shall have power * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-8\">\u201cEleventh: In the administration of any trust created hereby <em>my </em>Trustees shall have power * * * \u201d \u201cTwelfth: In the administration of <em>my </em>estate * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b289-9\">Under the law of Texas, the only property Daniel owned or to which he was entitled at the time of his death was his half of the community. The care with which Daniel defined such property as <em>his residuary estate, </em>limiting it to the property to which <em>he </em>was entitled, seems to negate the construction that he intended to dispose of property he did not own. The studied absence of reference to the community or to Marie\u2019s share of the community seems to contradict the contention that Daniel disposed of the entire community, including Marie\u2019s half. Thus, (a) the unambiguous definition of the residuary estate as restricted to property which Daniel owned or was entitled to at the time of his death, (b) the use of the first person singular pronoun, and (c) the complete absence of any disposi-tive language relating to Marie\u2019s share indicate that Daniel did not purport to include Marie\u2019s half of the community in the testamentary trust of his residuary estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-12\">If no intention to dispose of Marie\u2019s property can be found in Paragraph Five, then it is difficult to read such an intention into the will, since that paragraph is the only one that is dispositive of the residuary estate. The Commissioner relies however on Paragraph Seventeen that is explanatory rather than dispositive. The paragraph reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aai-dedup-0\">\u201cSeventeenth: The provisions herein contained for the benefit of my wife are in lieu of dower and any or all other provisions statutory or otherwise for her benefit as my widow.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b289-14\">This provision is meaningless in a community property state such as Texas. There is no dower in Texas. And, a wife\u2019s ownership of half the community is not analogous to the common-law inchoate right of dower. One is a present, vested ownership. The other is a mere expectancy that may be snuffed out. In Texas a wife shares in community property not as a widow, but as a wife, <em>ipso jure, </em>the moment property is acquired. Community property has nothing to do with benefits for widows. Marie, under Texas law, therefore, had no rights of the character referred to in Paragraph Seventeen, as Judge Murdock pointed out in his dissent to the Tax Court holding.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b290-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>Since there is no language in the will to give aid and comfort to his view, the Commissioner is compelled to resort to speculation based on circumstances outside of the will. He contends that the husband\u2019s customary handling of all business matters and the wife\u2019s inexperience and lack of knowledge justify the conclusion that Daniel must have intended to dispose of all their property (her property included) by giving her a life estate with a competent trustee in charge for her protection. These circumstances exist in most marriages. If an election exists because a husband is experienced and a wife inexperienced in business, then a great majority of all wills put the wife to an election. Such speculation strikes us as a shaky basis for divesting a wife of her ownership of half the community.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">If we must speculate, we would give considerable weight to the fact that Daniel was married and lived under Texas community property law for twenty-six years. He was a man of affairs, a man of property, head of Continental Oil Company. In the last six years of his life, something like a cold war existed between the community property states and the noncommunity property states. Taxpayers of means were well aware of the tax involvements inherent in community property. It is difficult to believe that Daniel would not have stated his intentions clearly \u2014 if he had intended to require Marie to give up her half of the community as a condition to receiving his bounty.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> We think also that it is not without significance that when Texas attorneys, familiar with community property law, entered the case (on appeal), they reacted allergically to the contention that the will purported to put Marie to an election, or that she had made an election.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b291-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>B. If it might be said that the will puts Marie to an election, the record does not show that Marie did in fact elect to take under the will. Chase, the Trustee and Ancillary Executor, in its complaint filed in the Tax Court in 1953, <em>five years after Daniel\u2019s death, </em>alleged that \u201cno determination has yet been made as to whether or not the said Marie Elizabeth Moran has elected to take under the will\u201d. If anyone should know, Chase should know. Perlitz, the Executor, in his brief testimony, said that Marie had never asked \u201cwhether she had any right to move against the trust\u201d or \u201cagainst the will\u201d; and that he had never \u201cvolunteer [ed] that she might have any right to bring suit against the trustees\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">In the absence of any showing in the record that Marie had sufficient knowledge of her rights to make a conscious choice, it can hardly be said that she made an election. \u201cIn the absence of statutory regulation, it may be generally said that two things are necessary in order that acts relied upon will amount to an election: First, the party must have had knowledge of his rights; that is, he must have had knowledge of the condition and extent of the estate, and of his duty to choose between the inconsistent rights; second, that he intended to elect, as shown by his words and acts, viewed in the light of all the circumstances.\u201d Dunn v. Vinyard, Tex.Com.App.1923, 251 S.W. 1043, 1046.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">In Rippy v. Rippy, Tex.Civ.App.1932, 49 S.W.2d 494, 497, a widow sued the executor of her husband\u2019s estate for her one-half community property share. The defense was that her husband\u2019s will had put her to an election, and that by receiving money under the will she had made an election. The court held for the wife stating that: \u201cBut, if the terms of the will required appellee to elect to take thereunder, the evidence is undisputed that she had no knowledge of her rights in the premises, nor that she was required <em>to choose between inconsistent rights </em>* * * she accepted the $500 without any knowledge that she was required to choose between two inconsistent rights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">In this case, as in Rippy v. Rippy and in Dunn v. Vinyard, there is no showing, so far as the record goes, that Marie had knowledge of her rights, nor that she understood that it might be said she was to choose between two inconsistent rights. There is no element of estoppel here. No one was misled to his prejudice. Marie received no benefits to which she was not entitled \u2014 on the assumption that Daniel created a trust of his half. The full income was hers: half in her own right for her share of the community, half as income beneficiary under the trust. She was entitled, therefore, to receive the full income from the trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-9\">The record is barren of any evidence to show intention by Marie to create a trust by allowing Chase to have possession of her share of the community. In community property states a widow may leave her share of community with the executor, usually a bank that serves also as trustee under a testamentary trust created by the deceased husband. The reasons are twofold: (1) to continue the administration of the former community as a whole and (2) to give a widow the benefit of a bank\u2019s custodial and managerial services. There was no necessity therefore, as in Delevan v. Thom, Tex.Civ.App.1951, 244 S.W.2d 551, that all of the Moran community be included in a trust; and there was nothing unusual about Marie receiving all of the income. It seems to us that, on the record, all that can be said of Chase\u2019s possession of Marie\u2019s share of the community is that it was held by the bank as agent or custodian. If it could be said that Marie created a trust under Texas law, the trust would be revocable (and therefore not subject to a gift tax.)<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b292-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>Weighing the language of the will and all the circumstances, we agree with the taxpayer that the will did not put Marie to an election and she made no effort to elect. Accordingly, Marie made no taxable transfer of her share of the. community. It is still in her taxable estate. If she chooses to follow her husband\u2019s example, she may do so now by gift or by will. This determination gives full effect to the community property law of Texas, is consistent with the gift tax law, and is in the interest of justice: a wife is not divested of ownership of her share of the community by a loose construction of a will.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">VI. The Insurance Trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">The Commissioner\u2019s position is that on Daniel\u2019s death Marie made a taxable gift of one-half of the value of the proceeds of the insurance policies less the value of a life estate in that half. Chase, the trustee, contends (on appeal) that, although Daniel could revoke the trust and change beneficiaries, Marie could not, and as to her the trust was complete and irrevocable in 1928 when it was created, and therefore there is no tax. The Tax Court held that there was no tax. Under Texas decisions, as the Tax Court construed them, since a surviving wife has no community property interest in the <em>proceeds </em>of insurance payable to a named beneficiary,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Marie could make no taxable gift involving any part of the proceeds. We agree with the Commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-9\">If the decision of the Tax Court is upheld, consistency would require that the entire proceeds of insurance policies be included in a husband\u2019s estate, notwithstanding his ownership of only half of the marital community. The results reached by the Tax Court (A) violate principles of Texas community property law, (B) are contrary to the pre-1942 tax cases (now revitalized by the Revenue Act of 1948), and (C) frustrate the national policy of tax equalization expressed in the Revenue Act of 1948 and interpreted in the regulations carrying out that policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-10\">A. The holding of the Tax Court is not surprising in view of the apparent inconsistency of the Texas cases' and the professed inability of some authorities to find a rational basis for reconciling the cases.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> We have no desire to rush in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>where Texans fear to tread. If, however, there is a rational principle running through the Texas cases, we must find it and apply it: local law determines property rights.<footnotemark>22a</footnotemark> We believe that a close study of the Texas cases shows that the inconsistency is only apparent, not real, and that there is a discoverable touchstone for applying orthodox community property principles to insurance. The touchstone is the distinction between <em>policy-rights </em>and proceeds-rights.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\">Our study of the Texas cases indicates that the doubt that has arisen as to whether insurance is property subject to ownership by the community has been caused by courts failing to <em>say </em>that they distinguish between <em>policy-rights </em>and <em>proceeds-rights. </em>Texas courts consistently make this distinction in their holdings. And consistently recognize that policy-rights are a property asset of the community, and proceeds-rights are property of the named beneficiary (after maturity of the policy) \u2014 however often one encounters the language \u201cinsurance is not property\u201d in cases involving contests over proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-12\">Policy-rights include the whole bundle of incidents of ownership of property in a policy \u2014 all the rights except the right to the proceeds. This bundle includes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>all \u201cthe economic benefits of the insurance, the cash surrender value, the power to change the beneficiary, the power to surrender or cancel the policy, the power to assign the policy or revoke an assignment, the power to pledge the policy for a loan, the power to obtain from the insurer a loan against the surrender value of the policy\u201d.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> These are property rights, as any lawyer or business man knows. They are owned by the marital community when the community pays for the insurance and there is a revocable designation of beneficiary. The right to insurance proceeds is also property just as any other contractual right to money is property, but it is in the beneficiary by a contract which the husband as manager of the community can legally make. If the right to change the beneficiary is reserved, the beneficiary\u2019s proceeds-rights are inchoate until the death of the insured, when these proceeds-rights vest by virtue of the terms of the contract; but in this sense only can it be said that insurance <em>(i. e., </em>the right to the proceeds) is not property subject to the laws of descent, heirship, or community property.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">No one familiar with the workings of the community property system should be surprised that Texas courts hold that the wife has no interest in insurance proceeds received by a third party beneficiary. <em>In the absence of fraud, the wife- has no interest in any community property a third person has receivedl by sale or donation, </em>even though half of the property transferred was the wife\u2019s-The wife\u2019s lack of interest in the proceeds, however, is not inconsistent with, the view that the <em>community </em>effects a. gift of the proceeds to a third person, beneficiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-10\">There is not one case in Texas that, fails to recognize, <em>in result, </em>that insurance <em>is </em>property: when the policy-rights are at issue or, if proceeds-rights-are at issue, when the contest is between, the surviving spouse and a third party beneficiary and there is no fraud.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> There is smog only when there is a contest between the surviving spouse, or her heirs, and the insured, or his heirs, and the practical effect of applying these principles would be to allow the husband to augment his separate estate at the expense of the community. That factual situation is not present in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-11\">The Tax Court recognized that up to the time of Daniel\u2019s death the insurance (at least, the cash surrender value) was community property in which the wife had a vested interest. The Tax Court and Chase, the trustee, did not recognize, however, that when Daniel took out the insurance and created the insurance trust, he acted and could act only as manager of the community. The right of revocation was not in Daniel individually, nor was the trust irrevocable only as to Marie\u2019s half of the community. Daniel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>held the power of revocation as agent or manager of the community. When he died without having exercised that power, the insurance became payable and the trust became irrevocable. His death operated to effect a taxable transfer from the community (husband and wife), rather than to preclude a taxable transfer from Marie, as the tax court seemed to think.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">A review of the jurisprudence shows that the Texas courts invariably treat policy-rights in insurance as property that is a community asset. Just as invariably, they hold that in the absence of fraud, the wife has no community interest in the proceeds of insurance payable to a third party beneficiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">The first case to deal with the problem is the frequently cited case of Martin v. Moran, 1895, 11 Tex.Civ.App. 509, 32 S.W. 904, 906. The husband insured his life <em>for the benefit of his own estate, </em>paying premiums with community funds. The Court held that the wife had a half interest in the proceeds. The Court accepted the proposition that insurance was property and analogized an insurance policy to a promissory note taken during the marriage for a loan of community funds and paid after the death of the husband. The analogy is not sound as to insurance proceeds payable to a third party beneficiary, since the promissory note is really payable to the community. The analogy is sound as to insurance payable to the husband\u2019s estate, only if he is regarded as acting as agent for the community in designating his estate as beneficiary. The result, however, is sound; not because insurance <em>proceeds </em>are a community asset, but because the Court in that case found it was fraudulent for the husband to augment his separate estate at the expense of the community. The Court said: \u201cThe husband can give his interest in the community property to another, but he cannot give his wife\u2019s interest [in the community] to himself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">In the converse of the situation, where an insurance policy is payable to the <em>wife, </em>Texas law is clear that the proceeds are <em>her </em>separate property. San Jacinto Bldg., Inc., v. Brown, Tex.Civ.App.1935, 79 S.W.2d 164; Evans v. Opperman, 1890, 76 Tex. 293, 13 S.W. 312; Davis v. Magnolia Petroleum Co., 134 Tex. 201, 134 S.W.2d 1042; Blackmon v. Hansen, 1943, 140 Tex. 536, 169 S.W.2d 962. That is because the husband is manager of the community, she is not; he can make a gift of community to her, but not to himself. These cases and Martin v. Moran, too, are good community property law.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">Martin v. McAllister, 1901, 94 Tex. 567, 63 S.W. 624, 625, has been criticized as a horrible example of what happens when insurance proceeds are not treated as community assets. In that ease, the husband took out a policy on the wife's life, <em>named himself as beneficiary, </em>and paid the premiums with community funds. The Supreme Court of Texas held that the wife\u2019s heirs were not entitled to share in the proceeds: \u201cThe right to the proceeds of the policy * * * rests upon the same principle * * * that the proceeds of the policy belong to the person named as payee, and it becomes property upon the contingency of the death of the insured\u201d. Martin v. Moran was not cited, but the holding is not necessarily inconsistent, since the Court could \u201csee no ground in the. <em>facts of this case </em>to impeach the action of the husband as fraudulent\u201d toward his wife. Since the proceeds-rights \u201ccould not become the property of the husband or wife during the lifetime of both of them, it cannot be held to be community, and is therefore the separate property of the one to whom it is made payable\u201d. * There is confusing language in the opinion, such as the statement that \u201ca policy of insurance is not a piece of property; it is the evidence of a contract\u201d.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> But the Court\u2019s thinking clearly centered about the proceeds-rights. Up to the moment of transfer, the policy-rights are commu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>nity assets; after the transfer, the wife has no interest. On the assumption that there was no fraud, the case is in line with the principle \u2014 stronger in Texas than in most community property states \u2014 that the husband can dispose freely of community assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">This is brought out clearly in Rowlett v. Mitchell, 1908, 52 Tex.Civ.App. 589, 114 S.W. 845, 847, in which community funds were used to pay premiums on a policy payable to <em>third persons, </em>the husband\u2019s children by his first marriage.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The policy was taken out before the second marriage. In a contest between the beneficiaries and the second wife the court held for the ben\u00e9ficiaries. \u201cThe right of the husband to dispose of the community estate except for the purpose of defrauding his wife is an absolute one * * * he' may expend their joint estate ever, so unwisely, may squander it in \u2018riotous living,\u2019 or may give it away.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">The next case, Jones v. Jones, Tex. Civ.App.1912, 146 S.W. 265, also involved the question whether the husband had acted in fraud of his wife. Shortly before his death the insured substituted his father for his wife as beneficiary on a policy purchased with community funds. The Court, relying on Rowlett v. Mitchell and Martin v. McAllister, held for the beneficiary on the ground that the evidence was insufficient to show fraud. The Court said that \u201can insurance policy is not property\u201d. But, as in Rowlett v. Mitchell, the holding involved a contest with a third party beneficiary over proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">These important early cases were on proceeds-rights. Whiteselle v. Northwestern Mutual Life Ins. Co., Tex.Com. App.1920, 221 S.W. 575, involved a contest over policy-rights. Here, there was a divorce \u25a0 and the issues were whether the community had a claim for reimbursement for premiums paid and whether the cash surrender value was an asset of the community. The Court rejected the wife\u2019s claims. Texas courts have now reversed their position on cash surrender. In San Jacinto Bldg. v. Brown, Tex.Civ.App.1935, 79 S.W.2d 164, the wife was the beneficiary, and a creditor of the husband was attempting to reach community property. The Court held that the cash surrender value was a community asset, but it was consumed in the payment of the proceeds to the wife;, that the proceeds were the separate property of the wife. Russell v. Russell, Tex.Civ.App.1935, 79 S.W.2d 639, gave fulll recognition to this characteristic of insurance in holding that upon divorce a wife is entitled to one-half the cash surrender value of a policy purchased with community funds. This result was approved in Locke v. Locke, Tex.Civ.App. 1940, 143 S.W.2d 637, another divorce case, in which the court specifically stated that the cash surrender value of the policy is a community asset, and that, the wife has a vested one-half interest in this asset. This was followed in Berdoll v. Berdoll, Tex.Civ.App.1940, 145 S.W.2d 227, and Womack v. Womack, 1943, 141 Tex. 299, 172 S.W.2d 307, 308.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-11\">Womack v. Womack is a direct recognition by the Texas Supreme Court that, the policy rights in an insurance policy constitute community property. This-was a divorce case involving policies on the lives of both spouses. The Court stated: \u201cThe courts of this State have-held that the \u2018cash surrender value\u2019 of a policy is property, and may be considered and treated as community property.\u201d Whiteselle was expressly overruled. The Court based its holding on a broad <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>construction of property, extending to \u201cevery species of valuable right and interest\u201d; and on the intention of the Texas legislature, \u201cto give the term \u2018community property\u2019 a broader meaning than it was originally given [in Article 4619, Vernon\u2019s Annotated Civ.Stat.]\u201d. The Court pointed out that \u201cmany of the modern decisions hold that a life insurance policy is property\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">Thompson v. Calvert, Tex.Civ.App. 1957, 301 S.W.2d 496, carried Womack to its logical conclusion. That case, like the instant case, involved policies on the husband\u2019s life taken out during marriage and paid for with community funds, the insured retaining the right to change the beneficiary. On the wife\u2019s death, the Court, approving a ruling of the Texas Attorney General in 1949, treated the policy-rights as a community asset and held that one-half of the cash surrender value of the policies at the time of the wife\u2019s death should be included in the wife\u2019s estate for inheritance tax purposes.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">Blackmon v. Hansen, 1943, 140 Tex. 536, 169 S.W.2d 962, dealt with proceeds. In that case the Texas Supreme Court held that where insurance on a husband\u2019s life, payable to the wife, was paid for with community funds, one-half of the proceeds should be included in the husband\u2019s gross estate in calculating the State Inheritance Tax. This is on the community property principle that the husband is responsible for only half of the transfer (transformation) of policy-rights into proceeds-rights; the other half comes from the wife herself. Had the insurance been payable to the husband\u2019s estate, still only half of the proceeds could have been included in <em>his </em>taxable estate. The Court followed Lang v. Commissioner, 1938, 304 U.S. 264, 58 S.Ct. 880, 82 L.Ed. 1331, in which the United States Supreme Court reached the same conclusion based not on the wife\u2019s ownership of the proceeds but on (1) her payment of half of the premiums and (2) her husband\u2019s possession of the incidents of ownership as agent of the community.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">Blackmon v. Hansen and Thompson v. Calvert establish the Texas rule for taxation of insurance on the life of a husband when the premiums are paid with community funds and the insured retains the right to change the beneficiary. That is the basic factual situation in the instant case. Since both the state and federal laws for estate-inheritance and gift tax purposes \u201ctax the transfer of a present vested interest, state cases interpreting the Texas Inheritance Tax Law should be decisive for the Federal Court in applying state law\u201d. Morrison, Life Insurance \u2014 Tax Aspects, 5 Texas Institutes, p. 139 (1957). Applying Blackmon v. Hansen to federal estate and gift taxes applicable to insurance payable to a third person, one-half of the proceeds are includible in the husband\u2019s estate and one-half are a taxable gift to the wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-9\">Volunteer State Life Ins. Co. v. Hardin, 1946, 145 Tex. 245, 197 S.W.2d 105, 168 A.L.R. 337 points up the distinction we are seeking to make. There the insured husband named his two sisters as beneficiaries. On the death, first of the wife, and later of the husband, the wife\u2019s son and sole heir asserted a claim to share in the proceeds to the extent of one-half of the cash surrender value at the date of his mother\u2019s death. The court held that neither the community nor the wife had a vested right to share in the proceeds of the policies. Martin v. McAllister was quoted with approval. As Professor Huie points out: \u201c * * * the decision in the Hardin case was basically sound. The problem before the court was how far the husband could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>go in making gifts of community property to third persons. * * * [The] result seems in line with the better view in cases involving gifts of third persons * * * Such gifts, whether by means of life insurance or otherwise, are sustained if they are not deemed a fraud on the wife\u2019s' community rights\u201d.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">In other words, the Texas courts <em>do </em>treat insurance as property; and, they are \u201cbasically sound\u201d \u2014 as long as they hold that the husband may give to anybody but his estate. That is the basic position of critics of the Texas courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">Sherman v. Roe, 1953, 153 Tex. 1, 262 S.W.2d 393, 397, concerned the death of a husband and wife in an airplane crash, before enactment of the Texas Simultaneous Death Act, V.A.T.S. Probate Code, \u00a7 47. Insurance on the husband\u2019s life was taken out before his marriage and paid for with separate funds until his marriage. The proceeds were payable to the wife if she survived him, otherwise the proceeds were payable to his estate. It could not be determined who died first. The Court cut the Gordian knot by awarding the proceeds equally to the estates of husband and wife on the theory that the proceeds were community. The Court relied on the statutory presumption in Article 4619 that \u201call the effects which the husband and wife possess at the time the marriage may be dissolved shall be regarded as common effects or gains, unless the contrary be satisfactorily proved\u201d. The opinion shows the dialectic difficulty courts in community property states have in handling insurance. The Court denied that \u201cthe certificate was community property and [that] consequently the proceeds must be community property\u201d. Yet in asserting that the proceeds should be regarded as part of the \u201ceffects possessed\u201d at the dissolution of the marriage, the court necessarily treated the contract fight to the proceeds as property in existence at the dissolution of the marriage, although maturing on the death of the insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-13\">Warthan v. Haynes, Tex.1956, 288 S.W.2d 481, termed \u201cthe ultimate bombshell\u201d,<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> has been widely discussed and criticized in Texas.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> In that case husband and wife were killed in an automobile accident. Unlike Sherman v. Roe it was established that the wife died some fifteen to thirty minutes before her husband. There were three insurance policies on the husband, one taken out before marriage. The wife was the primary beneficiary and the husband\u2019s estate the alternate beneficiary in two of the policies; the third had no provision for an alternate beneficiary. The contest was between the respective administrators of the estates of the husband and wife. The majority of the Court awarded the proceeds of all three policies to the husband\u2019s separate estate, without any right to reimbursement to the community for funds used to pay premiums.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> The Court relied heavily on Vol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>unteer State Life Insurance Co. v. Hardin in holding that the named beneficiary is entitled to the proceeds where there is no fraud on the wife; limited Sherman v. Roe to its peculiar facts; and reaffirmed Martin v. McAllister. Martin v. Moran was distinguished \u2014 properly, it \u2022seems to us \u2014 on the ground that \u201cunder certain circumstances\u201d a husband\u2019s making a policy payable to his estate may be a fraud on his wife [153 Tex. 1, 262 S.W.2d 396]; here with the wife named as first beneficiary, there was no question \u2022of fraud. The opinion specifically recognizes that for tax purposes only, half the proceeds would be includible in the husband\u2019s estate under state inheritance tax laws, citing Blackmon v. Hansen, but pointed out that it was clearly established in Texas that proceeds payable to the wife were <em>her </em>separate property based upon the husband\u2019s right to make a gift.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b299-10\">With due deference, it seems to us that the Texas courts were less enmeshed in conflicting concepts than some of their critics. The decision recognizes that insurance is community property as to policy rights, but that the transfer or conversion of those rights into proceeds-rights by a contract entered into by the husband <em>in the absence of fraud </em>cuts off the wife\u2019s community interest. This may put an excessive reliance on corrective action based on fraud, but it is a perfectly rational principle of the community system as long as the husband continues as managing partner.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b300-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>Summarizing, and readily admitting that our review of the Texas cases tends to oversimplify a complex subject, it seems to us that the following conclusions may be drawn. (1) Without using the terms, Texas courts do in fact recognize that insurance is property and in their holdings, if not their opinions, break down property in insurance between policy-rights and proceeds-rights. (2) Policy-rights in an insurance policy are property, a community asset, when the insurance is purchased with community funds. (3) The wife has a present, vested interest in this asset, as she has in all other community property. (4) This interest ceases, in the absence of fraud, when the policy matures and the bundle of policy rights is converted into insurance proceeds payable to a named third-party beneficiary, just as the wife\u2019s interest in any other community asset is cut off by transfer of the assets to a third person. (5) The transfer is from the community. Under Black-mon v. Hansen, only half of the proceeds fall in the husband\u2019s taxable estate. The other half is a taxable gift from the wife. (6) The Tax Court, therefore, is mistaken in attaching importance to the fact that \u201cMarie did not have a community interest in the proceeds of the policy as against the named beneficiaries\u201d. That is the orthodox situation with respect to transfers in the absence of fraud and is not inconsistent with subjecting Marie\u2019s half to a gift tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">B. Prior to the enactment of the Revenue Act of 1942, the federal courts generally recognized the tax implications of accepting insurance as a community asset, whether the test of taxability was payment of premiums or possession of the incidents of ownership or both.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Some of the decisive cases were decided by this Court. This is of more than academic interest; in repealing the controversial provisions of the Revenue Act of 1942 and enacting the Revenue Act of 1948 Congress revitalized the pre-1942 interpretations of community property law.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">The first important federal tax case dealing with insurance purchased with community funds was Newman v. Commissioner, 5 Cir., 1935, 76 F.2d 449, involving Louisiana law. The policy was revocably payable to the wife. This Court held that the proceeds were in-cludible in full in the husband-insured\u2019s gross estate. The Court based its decision on the fact that the proceeds constituted a gift by the husband to the wife for which \u201cthe estate of neither is regarded as having paid the premiums so as to be entitled to reimbursement\u201d. On the same type of policy and the same regulation, using the premium payment test, the United States Supreme Court reached the opposite result from the result reached in the Newman case. In Lang v. Commissioner, 1938, 304 U.S. 264, 58 S. Ct. 880, 883, 82 L.Ed. 1331, the Supreme Court held that since community funds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>were used to pay the premiums, the wife contributing half, that the policies were \u201ctaken out\u201d by the deceased husband-insured only to the extent of one-half of the proceeds. \u201cIn the absence of a clear declaration it cannot be assumed that Congress intended insurance bought and paid for with the funds of another than the insured and not payable to the latter\u2019s estate, should be reckoned as a party of such estate for purpose of taxation.\u201d The Court held that the policies payable to the children should be accorded the same treatment as the policies payable to the wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\">DeLappe v. Commissioner, 5 Cir., 1940, 113 F.2d 48, concerned a Louisiana insured husband who took out policies during the marriage naming revocably his wife, children, and others as beneficiaries. At this time, under Regulation 80, the incidents of ownership test and the premium payment test were alternative tests of tax liability. Relying upon general principles of Louisiana law, this Court held that the proceeds of policies payable to a named beneficiary other than the estate of the deceased insured could be taxed in husband\u2019s estate only to the extent of one-half the proceeds. The Court specifically held that under community property principles, the wife owned one-half of the policies, since the insured husband paid premiums and exercised the incidents of ownership (including the power to change the beneficiary) as agent for the community, not as an individual owner. The DeLappe decision was followed in Howard v. United States, 5 Cir., 1942, 125 F.2d 986.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">The rationale of the Lang, DeLappe, and Howard eases is applicable to the existing tax situation as to estate and gift taxes. \u201cThe net result should be, it would appear, that incidents of ownership possessed by the husband such as the reserved power to change beneficiaries, under circumstances where the proceeds are payable to a named beneficiary, rather than the insured\u2019s estate, are incidents of ownership held as agent of the marital community. Thus, the proceeds should be includible to the extent of only one-half in the estate of the insured.\u201d Eichenbaum, Estate Taxation of Insurance Proceeds in Community Property States, 1952 Tulane Tax Institute, 251.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">C. For a number of years pressure built up against community property states. Taxpayers in other states considered that they were discriminated against in tax treatment. Finally, in 1942 Congress adopted amendments to the estate and gift tax laws aimed directly at the community property states. These amendments taxed all community property to the first spouse to die, regardless of the surviving spouse\u2019s vested ownership of half of the property. The brief language of former section 811(g) of the Internal Revenue Code was replaced with an entirely new section 811 (g) (4), the effect of which was to overrule by statute the Lang, DeLappe, and Howard cases. Under the 1942 law, the payment of premiums and the exercise of the incidents of ownership by the husband, was <em>not </em>as manager of the community but in his own behalf. This resulted in including all of the proceeds of insurance in the husband\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-9\">The 1942 Act increased rather than diminished the agitation for equalization. It whetted the appetites of the common-law states for income tax equalization. It produced hardships and dissatisfaction among taxpayers in community property states.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> After long negotiations between representatives of the taxpayers in the two groups of states, and representatives of the Treasury and of Congress, with all ultimately in agreement, Congress repealed the unfortunate amendments in the 1942 Act and adopted the equalization bill as part of the Revenue Act of 1948.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> This law makes com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>prehensive changes in income, gift, and estate tax laws designed to equalize all these taxes between taxpayers in common law states and taxpayers in community states. The 1948 Act recognizes the realities of spousal ownership in a community property system. Equalization in income taxes is achieved by allowing the joint return. Equalization in estate and gift taxes is achieved for non-community property by the marital deduction and split gift provisions.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> In the case of life insurance, the repeal of Section 811(g) (4) was intended to make applicable the rules of Section 811(g) which would be applicable had paragraph (4) never been contained in Section 811 (g).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">The effect of repeal of the 1942 Act is to bring a return to the rule of the Lang, DeLappe, and Howard cases: incidents of ownership possessed by the husband, such as the power to change beneficiaries, are held as agent of the community; the proceeds, therefore, are includible to the extent of only one-half in the estate of the insured; the other half would be taxable as a gift by the wife, if the proceeds are payable to a third person. In order to conform the Treasury Regulations with the equalization measures, the Commissioner issued Treasury Decisions 5698 and 5699, 1949-1, 181, 226, the Cum.Bull. 181, 266 amending the gift and estate tax regulations. Treasury Decision 5698, issued May 13, 1949 added to the gift tax regulations, Section 86.2(a), the following subsection:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-7\">\u201c(9) Where property held by a husband and wife as community property is used to purchase insurance upon the husband\u2019s life and a third person is revocably designated as beneficiary and under the State law the husband\u2019s death is considered to make absolute the transfer by the wife, there is a gift by the wife at the time of such death of one-half the amount of the proceeds of such insurance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b302-8\">After some uncertainty, the Internal Revenue Bureau has clarified its position by several rulings. Rev.Rul. 48, 1953-1 Cum.Bull. 392;<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Rev.Rul. 232, 1953-22 Cum.Bull. 21. These rulings recognize that the policy-rights in insurance payable revocably to a third person beneficiary inure to the benefit of the community; therefore, under Treasury Regulations 105, Section 81.27 the proceeds are includible in the insured\u2019s gross estate to the extent of one-half under the incidents of ownership tests; and, under Treasury Regulations 108, Section 86.2(a) (9), the wife makes a gift of the other half upon the death of the insured husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-9\">Cutting through all of this review of cases and statutes and regulations is the sharp knife of the intendment of Congress in imposing gift and estate taxes generally, and as set forth in the 1948 Act. Failure to give effect to the regulations will defeat the national policy of tax equalization.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-10\">Judges and lawyers hypnotize themselves with words. In Texas the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>words were: \u201cinsurance is not property\u201d. The Tax Court here could not escape the phrase, \u201cthe wife has no interest in <em>proceeds\u201d. </em>But gift and estate taxation of insurance is not based on receipt of proceeds. It is based on the <em>transfer </em>of property rights.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> All gift and estate taxes are based on the transfer of effective control over property rights, not the donee\u2019s or heir\u2019s receipt of property. Insurance proceeds are a measure of the value of the transfer. \u201cThe question propounded by the Court of Claims in form suggest that the tax is one imposed by the statute upon the policies. This we have shown is not the case. It is the transfer, * * * which is the subject of the tax. The tax is not on the policies.\u201d Chase National Bank of City of New York v. United States, 1939, 278 U.S. 327, 49 S.Ct. 126, 129, 73 L.Ed. 405. The Newman case was overruled, but what this Court said in that case as to the incidence of gift taxes, we say again now, with a slight change, italicized: \u201cWe think it plain that the statute in question imposes a death tax, not upon the proceeds of insurance policies, the property of the estate, nor upon the proceeds of insurance policies which but for the gift to the beneficiary would be owned by decedent, <em>but upon the cessation, </em>* * * <em>of </em>the control he had over the policies, [as <em>agent of the </em>community] so that his death vested in the beneficiary a settled right which she did not have before.\u201d Newman v. Commissioner, 5 Cir., 1935, 76 F.2d 449, 450, 452. See also Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Wemyss, 1945, 324 U.S. 303, 65 S.Ct. 652, 89 L.Ed. 958; Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Berger, 2 Cir., 1952, 201 F.2d 171; Hooker v. Commissioner, 5 Cir., 1949, 174 F.2d 863.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">In a community property state where insurance on the husband\u2019s life is purchased with community funds, payable revocably to a third person beneficiary, the husband\u2019s right to change the beneficiary and all other control over the property are held as agent of the community. The bundle of rights in the policy is owned by the community. Something happens to this bundle when the insured dies, thereby terminating his control over the property and bringing the community to an end. What happens is, that the community\u2019s property interests in the policy-rights are transformed into the beneficiary\u2019s right to the proceeds. It is a shift in control and a shift of beneficial interest. This is the transfer that is taxed.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">Up to the time of his death, Daniel, as managing agent of the community, had the right to change beneficiaries. When he died without exercising this right, the transfer to the trustee was a completed gift from the community: one-half therefore should have fallen in the taxable estate of the deceased husband. The other half is a taxable gift from the surviving spouse.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">Under the terms of the trust agreement Marie was the income beneficiary for life. Accordingly, the measure of her gift was half the amount of the proceeds less a life estate in that half.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-9\">VII. Transferee Liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-10\">On appeal counsel for the taxpayer argue that even if Marie made a gift at the time of Daniel\u2019s death, the value of such gift could not exceed the value of her half of the cash surrender value of the policies less the value of her retained life interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>Counsel cite Womack v. Womack and Warthan v. Haynes. The Womack case was a divorce suit. Both spouses were still alive. The only property that could be divided was the cash surrender value. In the Warthan case, although the wife died first, cash surrender values were not at issue; the Court awarded the proceeds to the named beneficiary (the husband\u2019s separate estate). More in point is Blackmon v. Hansen holding that where insurance is paid for with community funds, one-half of the proceeds should be included in the husband\u2019s estate for state inheritance tax purposes; \"one-half [is] the property of the wife, and that said part is no part of the estate of the husband.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">Counsel for the taxpayer relies on a line of cases involving transferee liability for income taxes, citing especially two recent Supreme Court decisions: Commissioner v. Stern, 1958, 357 U.S. 39, 78 S.Ct. 1047, 2 L.Ed.2d 1126 and United States v. Bess, 1958, 357 U.S. 51, 78 S.Ct. 1054, 2 L.Ed.2d 1135. These cases and similar cases involving transferee liability for income taxes are inapplicable. The Supreme Court considered that transferee liability depended on whether or not a federal lien attached while the insured, the tax debtor, was still alive. If so, the commissioner could collect up to the cash surrender value only.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> In cases involving income taxes, the liability necessarily attaches during the life of the insured, when the only property that the debtor has in insurance (disregarding replacement value or reserve value) is the cash surrender value. That is all he co.uld transfer and all that could be subject to the government\u2019s lien. It is quite different from transferee liability for estate or gift taxes. Here, liability cannot attach until the transfer; and the transfer itself is the subject of the tax liability. Cash surrender has no significance in this case; the transfer is of proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-9\">As the court pointed out expressly in Rowen v. Commissioner, 2 Cir., 1954, 215 F.2d 641, 646, 647, the \u201ccash surrender value were assets of the decedent in his lifetime\u201d; the proceeds of insurance policies were subject to transferee liability in the hands of the beneficiaries for estate tax purposes. The result would be the same as to the gift tax. The two taxes are in <em>pari materia </em>and must be construed together. Merrill v. Fahs, 1945, 324 U.S. 308, 311, 65 S.Ct. 655, 89 L.Ed. 963. The gift tax transferee provisions (Section 1025 of the 1939 Code) like the estate tax provisions (Sections 827 and 900 of the 1939 Code) plainly extend to all transferred property including the proceeds of life insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-10\">VIII. The Living Trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-11\">The Tax Court held that the living trust was \"clearly testamentary\u201d. The principal therefore remained community property, and Daniel had no power to deprive Marie of her share of the community. When, however, Marie \u201cchose to abide by the terms of the trust in accepting payments of income, she elected to waive and surrender her property interest in the principal thereof and made a taxable gift\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-12\">This reasoning disregards the fact that if the trust were testamentary, it would be invalid because of the Statute of Wills, and Daniel\u2019s half would fall into his residuary estate. Marie could not cure the invalidity by surrendering her half of the community. There would be no valid trust to which she could surrender her property.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-13\">A. Scott,<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> Bogert,<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> and the Restatement<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> do not share the Tax <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>Court view that such a trust is \u201cclearly testamentary\u201d. On the contrary, \u201cIt has been universally held that the creation of a trust inter vivos is not a testamentary disposition merely because the settlor reserves a power to revoke the trust or to modify it, even though in addition he reserves a beneficial life interest in the trust property.\u201d Scott, The Effects of a Power to Revoke a Trust, 57 Harv.L.Rev. 362, 368 (1944). Virtually no cases can be found holding a contrary view. The trust comes into being at the time when the settlor delivers the property to the trustee, and all the beneficiaries acquire interests in the trust at that time, even though there is a condition subsequent allowing the settlor to deprive the beneficiaries of their interests. Unlike a will, \u201cthe death of the settlor is not a condition precedent to the vesting of the interest in the beneficiary. The distinction between a disposition to take effect only on the death of the donor and one to take effect immediately but subject to be revoked may seem to be formal rather than substantial, but it is an important one, and one which has a determinative effect on other problems [the reach of creditors, for example].\u201d 1 Scott on Trusts, Section 57.1, p. 445. Here, Marie acquired an interest when the trust was created. It was subject to divestment, but once acquired, it might never be divested. In fact, it was not divested.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">Add the power to modify and revoke the trust, and the law is still clear that the trust is on the right side of the line. Add the element of control over the trustee\u2019s administration and the trust may cross the line or come so close to the line that courts will divide as to whether a trust is not a trust but a will, depending on the degree of control reserved. Where, however, in an \u201cillusory\u201d trust the settlor \u201creserves such power to control the trustee in the administration of the trust that in effect the trustee is merely his agent acting under his direction, the disposition is testamentary\u201d. Scott, The Effects of a Power to Revoke a Trust, 57 Harv.L.Rev. 362, 371 (1944).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-9\">Here, a close examination of the Moran living trust agreement shows not a word or clause to indicate any intention by the settlor to control the trustee. Further, the trustee is given broad powers of administration, including the right to retain or purchase non-legals and \u201cin its discretion\u201d to make any investments \u201cit may choose\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-10\">B. In concluding that the trust was testamentary, the Tax Court relies on a line of New York cases holding certain trusts \u201cillusory\u201d, citing the leading case of Newman v. Dore, 1937, 275 N.Y. 371, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>9 N.E.2d 966, 112 A.L.R. 643, Hirsch-field v. Ralston, Sup.1926, 66 N.Y.S.2d 59, and In re Sanchez\u2019 Estate, Sur.1945, 58 N.Y.S.2d 230. With due deference, it seems to us that these cases are inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">In Newman v. Dore [275 N.Y. 371, 9 N.E.2d 968] a married man transferred <em>all </em>of his property in trust reserving a life estate and the power of revocation. The trust agreement stated that trustee\u2019s powers were \u201csubject to the settlor\u2019s control during his life\u201d and could be exercised \u201cin such manner only as the settlor shall from time to time direct in writing\u201d. As the Court said, \u201cthe settlor reserved substantially the same rights to enj'oy and control the disposition of the property he previously had possessed\u201d. In re Sanchez\u2019 Estate concerned a transfer of a stock certificate by a husband with intent to defraud his creditors, among them his wife from whom he was separated. Sanchez retained possession and control of the certificate. The Court found that the transfer was fraudulent and illusory. In Hirsehfield v. Ralston the complaint alleged that a husband conveyed his business to a third person through transfer of stock, to defraud his wife of her distributive share of his estate and to disinherit his daughter. The Court held that the complaint failed to state a cause of action, because there was no allegation that the husband owned and controlled the business and the stock at the time of his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">These cases are typical of illusory trusts. There is seldom an express trust by agreement, as in the Moran trust, or, if there is, the settlor in terms reserves virtually complete control over the trustee\u2019s administration of the trust. In either instance, the transferor reserves such a degree of control over the property that the Court is driven to the conclusion there is no real intent to transfer and that the whole transaction is a sham.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">In addition, in the illusory trust cases there is an intent to deprive the wife of her expectant interest, her distributive share, and in most of the cases there is an intent to defraud the wife by transferring property to a third person. In none of the cases does the husband give his wife any beneficial interest in the so-called trust. None of these circumstances are shown to exist here. Newman died three days after he executed his trust. Had the Newman trust been upheld, his wife would have received nothing. Had Daniel died three days after November 28, 1948, the value of Marie\u2019s life interest in the whole of the trust estate would have exceeded the value of her half interest in the community. There is nothing in the record to show that Daniel influenced the trustee in any way in its administration of the trust. There is no showing that the income from the Moran living trust was handled any differently from Daniel\u2019s earnings and other income; even revenue from a husband\u2019s separate property is community, under the law of Texas.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-9\">It must be borne in mind that <em>Daniel did no% create the trust. The community created it. </em>Any rights that were reserved in the settlor were rights held by the community. Newman exercised control over his trust property for himself; Daniel\u2019s control (in his case restricted to the right of revocation and modification) could be exercised only as <em>agent for the community.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b306-10\">Much closer in point is Marine Midland Trust Co. of Binghamton v. Stanford, 1939, 256 App.Div. 26, 9 N.Y.S.2d 648, affirmed mem. 1939, 281 N.Y. 760, 24 N.E.2d 20. There the Court upheld a transfer in trust where a husband retained the life estate, right of revocation and modification, and also the right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>withdraw the principal not to exceed $2,-000 in any year. The husband had previously turned over a little better than half of his estate to his wife from whom he was separated. The Court distinguished Newman v. Dore on the grounds that a trust is not illusory, if made with intent to transfer actual title. In arriving at the intent the Court emphasized that equities between the spouses may be considered.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">In the \u201cillusory\u201d trust cases the wife receives nothing. In each case the transfer is a sham devised by the husband to deprive the wife of her distributive share by making a purported gift to another while still retaining control. Here there is no pretense of any fraud. There is no showing that Daniel intended to deprive Marie of any rights or that the trust had that effect. On the contrary, Daniel wanted his wife to have her share and his too, but free of the burden of capital management. The income he received was community income.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">C. There are no illusory trust cases in Texas. The fact situation in such cases would be subject to the principle that, in the absence of fraud, a husband may transfer community property by gift or sale although the effect may be to divest the wife of her one-half interest in the property. To set aside a transfer as fraudulent, there would have to be an action by the wife or her heirs.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">The Tax Court states, however, that under the law of Texas the living trust was not sufficient to pass a present interest, citing Armington v. Gilcrease Oil Co., Tex.Civ.App., 190 S.W.2d 587, 595; Fleck v. Baldwin, 141 Tex. 340, 345, 172 S.W.2d 975, 978; Bridewell v. Clay, Tex.Civ.App., 185 S.W.2d 170, 172 and Postal Mutual Indemnity Co. v. Penn, Tex.Civ.App., 165 S.W.2d 495, 499.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-9\">This statement is not in accord with our understanding of the law of Texas. Bridewell v. Clay and Postal Mutual Indemnity Co. v. Penn did not involve trusts. Bridewell v. Clay simply held that a gift of a check is revocable until presented for payment. In Postal Mutual Indemnity Co. v. Penn, a workmen\u2019s compensation case concerning proof of dependency, the question was whether the dependent wife had received certain rent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>as a gift. In Armington v. Gilcrease the Armingtons purchased mineral leases but directed the seller to delay execution of the assignments until they decided to whom they wanted to make the assignments, reserving the revenue for themselves in the meantime. They had complete control and the gifts were never completed. Fleck v. Baldwin involved so-called \u201ctentative trusts\u201d, bank savings accounts and certificates for stock in building and loan companies, placed in the name of \u201cMrs. J. C. Baldwin, in trust for \u2014 Mrs. Fleck\u201d. Mrs. Baldwin retained poss\u00e9ssion of the passbooks and certificates and, as the Court said [141 Tex. 340, 172 S.W.2d 979], \u201cshe still regarded them as her 'own * * * and never intentionally parted with her right personally to exercise dominion and control over any part of her estate but constantly retained and exercised the authority to use and dispose of it as she willed\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">We have not found any Texas case that passed directly on the facts as presented by the Moran trust agreement. We believe that Texas courts would uphold the trust. Schmidt v. Schmidt, Tex.Civ.App. 1953, 261 S.W.2d 892, 895 distinguished Fleck v. Baldwin and similar cases: \u201cEach of the cited cases involved the question whether or not certain acts by a principal constituted a \u2018gift inter vivos\u2019 or simply an \u2018agency\u2019. * * * None of those cases is authority for the proposition that the owner of land may not convey the legal title thereto to another person and retain in himself the equitable or beneficial title\u201d, citing the Restatement, 1 Trusts, Sec. 114, and the Texas Trust Act, Article 7425b-7 of the Revised Civil Statutes of Texas, Vernon\u2019s Ann.Civ.St. This article permits a set-tlor to be a beneficiary. Article 7425b-41 provides that \u201cevery trust shall be revocable by the trustor during his lifetime, unless expressly made irrevocable\u201d. Together, the two articles seem to say that there is no logical impediment in Texas trust concepts to a trust such as the Moran living trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">We hold that the Moran living trust was not ambulatory; it was a present, valid trust created in 1928. Marie is the income beneficiary under the express terms of that trust and not because she receives the income in exchange for relinquishing her half of the community as part of an assumed election to accept the benefits of the trust. We do not have before us, therefore, the question at issue in Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Siegel, 9 Cir., 1958, 250 F.2d 339, that is, whether the wife\u2019s election to take under the will should be considered as a gift by the wife or a purchase of an annuity supported by consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">D. Our holding does not mean that' gift tax consequences attached at the time the trustee took title in 1928. In a transfer of property valid under state law, state law focuses on title. The federal gift and estate tax law focuses on transfer of the beneficial enjoyment of the property. One who creates a trust during his lifetime, even though he reserves a life estate, parts with legal title to the trustee and grants to the beneficiaries (including remainderman) an immediate equitable title. Transfer of the possession and enjoyment of the property may be deferred until some future time. It is this very situation that causes the application of the gift and estate tax laws. Treasury Regulation 108, Section 86.3 provide therefore: \u201cA gift [for tax purposes] is incomplete in every instance where a donor reserves the power to re-vest the beneficial title to the property in himself.\u201d The taxable incident is the shifting of the beneficial enjoyment in the trust property, no matter when title is vested. See Brady v. Ham, 1 Cir., 1930, 45 F.2d 454.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">Since Daniel retained the power of revocation (for the community), there was no taxable gift until the shift in beneficial enjoyment at his death. Estate of Sanford v. Commissioner, 1939, 308 U.S. 39, 60 S.Ct. 51, 84 L.Ed. 20; Burnet v. Guggenheim, 1933, 288 U.S. 280, 53 S.Ct. 369, 77 L.Ed. 748. When Daniel died the trust became irrevocable. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>His community one-half should have been included in his gross estate under Section 811(c) and 811(d) of the 1939 Code, and Marie made a taxable gift of the other half under Treasury Regulations, Section 86.2 and 86.3 less her retained life estate in such one-half.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">Had Daniel been acting for himself instead of for the community, and had the right of revocation been retained by him individually the taxpayer would have been on stronger ground to urge that, as to Marie, the gift was complete in 1928. But it was as agent for the community, that Daniel held the right of revocation. For tax purposes the gift was incomplete until the right of revocation ceased on Daniel\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">IX. Conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">Summarizing, we hold as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">1. As to the testamentary trust, we hold in favor of the taxpayer. The will of Daniel Moran did not put his wife to an election, nor did she elect (assuming that the will put her to an election). There was, therefore, no taxable gift of Marie Moran\u2019s share of the community to the testamentary trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-9\">2. As to the insurance trust, we hold in favor of the Commissioner. On the death of the insured, for tax purposes half of the proceeds of the insurance belonged in Daniel Moran\u2019s gross estate and the other half was a taxable transfer from Mrs. Moran, less her retained life interest in that half.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-10\">3. As to the living trust, we hold partly in favor of the Commissioner and partly in favor of the taxpayer. We hold that on Daniel Moran\u2019s death the trust became irrevocable. His half of the community belonged in his gross estate and his wife\u2019s half was a taxable gift to the trust less her retained life interest in that half.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-11\">Accordingly, the judgment is Reversed and the case Remanded for any appropriate proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b282-9\">.

Thom the record showed that the widow was of unsound mind when her husband died and was incapable of speech or of voluntary movement. This condition had existed for some time prior to her husband\u2019s death. The will was made five months before the testator died. These circumstances and the fact that the court found four or five expressions in the will indicating the testator\u2019s intention to dispose of his wife\u2019s share of the community, induced the Court to hold that the will put the widow to an election. In Baldwin v. Baldwin the testator stated that all of the property owned by his wife and himself was community, except her separate property, and he expressly recognized that his wife shared in the estate. The testator left several specific legacies of community property to third persons, showing a clear intention to dispose of his wife\u2019s share along with his. The will contained an election provision. All of this, plus fifteen years of administration by the wife as executor, induced the Court to hold that there was an election. Delevan v. Thom and Baldwin v. Baldwin may be distinguished or explained; in any event they are exceptional cases and against the trend. In each case the court starts its opinion by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>bowing in the direction of the line of decisions holding that in determining whether the will disposes of the beneficiary\u2019s property, the rule is that the will does not so dispose of the property unless it is \u201copen to no other construction\u201d.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b291-12\">.

The Tax Court held: \u201cHowever, the law of Texas appears to be that where the marriage is terminated by the death of the husband, the proceeds of the policies are payable to the named beneficiary and the wife does not have any community property interest that can be asserted against such proceeds. Cf. Jones v. Jones, Tex.Civ.App., 146 S.W. 265, 269; Rowlett v. Mitchell, 52 Tex.Civ.App. [589], at p[age] 592, 114 S.W. [845], at p[age] 847; Martin v.

The distinction may appear to be a bit unusual, but we must take the law of Texas as we find it. Until the Texas courts indicate otherwise, we must assume that the foregoing cases correctly establish the law of Texas, and they <em>appear </em>to hold that the wife has no community property interest in the proceeds of the policies upon the husband\u2019s \u25a0 death.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b292-13\">.

In Texas, unlike the civil law in some jurisdictions, the husband as manager of the community may make limited gifts of community property. Such gifts, however, are subject to the rule that the transfer must not be in fraud of the wife\u2019s community rights. Here the rule is not an absolute one, but relative, being largely a matter of degree and substantiality. If the gift is large in relation to the size of the community, and particularly, if made to one not an intimate member of the family group, tbe wife may, as to one-half, succeed in having it set aside. These rules would apply to gifts of life insurance. If the policy is assigned outright to a child or other third party and is not in fraud of the wife\u2019s rights, husband and wife each have made a gift of one-half. If a third party is named; beneficiary and the right to change beneficiaries is retained, the gift is incomplete until the death of the insured, at which time the rights of the beneficiary become vested and the spouses at that time have completed their gift. But if either the assignment of the policy or the beneficiary designation is in fraud of the wife\u2019s rightjs, she may recover half of the policy proceeds.\u201d Jackson, Community Property and Federal Taxes, 12 S.W.L.J. 1 (1958).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b295-8\">.

For example: \u201cThe rationale rests on the court\u2019s refusal to recognize the property aspects of life insurance * <em>* </em>In seeking simplicity, the court seems only to have perpetuated the logical inconsistency of labelling insurance as property for some purposes but not for others.\u201d Note, 35 Tex.L.Rev. 449 (1957).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b298-14\">. Judge Garwood wrote a powerful dissent, contending that insurance <em>is </em>property. He argued strongly that the proceeds of the policies taken out during the marriage are community property and should go to the community estate. But he reaches the same conclusion that Professor Huie reaches and we reach, that insurance payable to a third person \u201cmay in a proper case amount to no more than legitimate gifts of community property\u201d. He is careful to say that \u201cthis idea is not inconsistent with the idea that the community has a real interest in the policy [rights]. Certainly the husband [as manager or trustee] [for the community] has a real interest\u201d. What offends Judge Garwood, and properly, is that the husband may use his position <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>as trustee to augment Ms separate estate to the detriment of the community in \u2022cases where fraud may be difficult to find \u2022or may be absent. As Judge Garwood \u25a0puts it: \u201c[T]he community estate furnished all of the premiums * * * the Court holds the full proceeds to be separate estate of the husband * * * These sums of money, which, by every in-dicium classic in this and other community property states, are community property * * * become the separate estate of the assured husband merely because the contract happens to be one of life insurance\u201d.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b299-7\">. The Texas legislature has attempted recently to settle the alleged uncertainty by amending the statutory definition of property. Tex.Sess.Laws 1957, c. 404. This amendment recites that an emergency was created by \u201cthe fact that the case of Warthan v. Haynes * * * \u2022casts some doubt on the status of life insurance policies as property\u201d. Accordingly, the definition of property in Article 23 of the 1925 Texas Revised Statute, Vernon\u2019s Ann.Civ.St. art. 23, was amended to include \u201clife insurance policies and the effects thereof\u201d. As to the effect of this amendment see Swift, Housing Bill 900 and Your Life Insurance Policy, 20 Tex.Bar J. 691.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"34\">\n<p id=\"b299-8\">. This result may offend our sensibilities. Unquestionably, it is inconsistent with the concept of the community as an equal partnership. But it is not an aberration in the community property system attributable to failure of Texas courts to recognize insurance as property. It is a logical, though perhaps unnecessarily rigid extension of the orthodox principle that the husband is manager of the community and may expend it \u201cever so unwisely, may squander it in riotous living, or may give it away\u201d. There is a tighter rein on the husband in some community states.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-12\">If we may say so, without being presumptuous, the solution is not to pass a law saying that insurance is property. There are a number of solutions. California attacks the problem broadly. Under section 172 of the West\u2019s Ann.California Civil Code, as interpreted in the courts, any gift of community property without the wife\u2019s written consent may bo set aside as voidable. During the husband\u2019s lifetime the gift may be set aside completely; after the husband\u2019s death, insurance, for example, is voidable to the extent of one-half of the policy proceeds. New York Life Insurance Co. v. Bank of Italy, 1923, 60 Cal.App. 602, 214 P. 61. Narrowly, the legislature might declare that a gift from the husband to himself or to his estate is constructive fraud. Martin v. Moran almost said exactly this. Reimbursement of premiums to the community is a partial solution.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-13\">In Louisiana, as in Texas, a widow has no right to any part of insurance proceeds, if the policy is payable to a third person \u2014 even to her husband\u2019s illegitimate children or to his mistress. Sizeler v. Sizeler, 1930, 170 La. 128, 127 So. 388; Grayson v. Life Ins. Co. of Virginia, La.App.1932, 144 So. 643. But under Article 2408 of the LSA-Givil Code (and perhaps regardless of this article) a husband cannot appropriate community <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>property to his separate estate.

In Hopkins v. Bacon, 1930, 282 U.S. 122, 51 S.Ct. 62, 63, 75 L.Ed. 249, involving income taxes, the United States Supreme Court carefully reviewed the Texas cases on community property, including Martin v. Moran, Martin v. McAllister, and Rowlett v. Mitchell. The Supreme Court' concluded that the wife\u2019s interest in community property in Texas is \u201cproperly characterized as a present vested interest\u201d, notwithstanding the husband\u2019s extensive powers of management and control. Husband and wife, therefore, are entitled to make separate income tax returns, each for one-half of the community income. A similar review and result were reached for Arizona in Goodell v. Koch, 1930, 282 U.S. 118, 51 S.Ct. 62, 75 L.Ed. 247; California in United States v. Malcolm, 1931, 282 U.S. 792, 51 S.Ct. 184, 75 L.Ed. 814; Louisiana in Bender v.

In Blackmon v.

But, said the Court, \u201cafter all, the two laws are similar, in that the <em>transfer tawed is of the same thing, </em>the receipt whereof is taxed\u201d.

Scott, Reporter for the Restatement of Trusts, makes the point that the nature of the trust instrument is important. \u201cIf the creation of a trust is evidenced by a formal trust instrument, it would seem that the danger of fraud is not increased by the fact that the settlor may have reserved extensive powers.\u201d A revision of the Restatement of Trusts, Section 57, adopted in 1947 reads: \u201cWhere by the terms of the trust an interest passes to the beneficiary during the life of the settlor, the trust is not testamentary merely because the settlor reserves a beneficial life estate or because he reserves in addition a power to revoke the trust in whole or in part and a power to modify the trust, <em>and a power to control the trustee as to the Administration of the trust, and the disposition will not he invalid for failure to comply with the requirements of the Statute of Wills unless the terms are so informally stated and the power of control reserved is so great that it would violate the policy of the Statute of Wills to enforce it.\u201d </em>The italicized language was added in the 1947 revision of the section orginally adopted in 1935. The Moran trust agreement is a typical formal trust instrument of the type used by New York banks.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"45\">\n<p id=\"b306-6\">. In the illusory trust cases, \u201cthe set-tlor\u2019s control over property during his lifetime is so complete that to hold that it should not be included in the determination of the widow\u2019s distributive share would be clearly a violation of the statute which is to give ^the widow a share of all the property owned by him on his death\u201d. Scott, The Effects of a Power to Revoke a Trust, 57 Harv.L.Rev. 362, 371 (1944).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"46\">\n<p id=\"b307-6\">. Dunnett v. Shields, 1924, 97 Vt. 419, 123 A. 626, 631, is not a New York case, but in applying the illusory trust doctrine New York courts have of course relied, in part, on decisions of other states. In that case a widow brought suit to set aside a trust created by her husband during his lifetime. The widow claimed that the trust was invalid because it was a fraud upon her rights to her elective share. The trust reserved the right of revocation to the husband-settlor and also gave the husband a life estate in the trust income. At his death the wife was to have a life estate in the income, and at her death the trust provided for the ultimate distribution of the principal to \u25a0others. The court expressly found that the trust was made for the purpose of providing income to the wife after the husband\u2019s death, and that the trust was set up so that the property would not become a part of the husband\u2019s estate and as such subject to the exercise of the widow\u2019s statutory rights. The issue as stated by the court was whether when no express intent to defraud is found in fact, such a conveyance as was made in the instant ease can be said to be fraudulent in law. The court held no. Actual fraud in fact must be proved, and the mere fact that the settlor knew the effect of the conveyance was to deprive the wife of her elective share and give her a life estate in the same property does not give rise to a legal presumption of fraud. The Court stated: \u201c * * * can it be said that where provision is made \u2018primarily for the benefit of the widow, who has the right thereunder, if necessary, to have the entire estate used for her support,\u2019 * * * that the trust fails in the eyes of the law? We do not think so.\u201d See also National Shawmut Bank of Boston v. Cumming, 1950, 325 Mass. 457, 91 N.E.2d 337; Kerwin v. Donaghy, 1945, 317 Mass. 559, 59 N.E.2d 299; Boyle v. John M.

Continental Equitable Title and Trust Co., 1932, 307 Pa. 570, 161 A. 721 the Court upheld a trust where the husband had the right to revoke and reserved the life estate but had no control over the trustee \u2014 although the declared purpose of the trust was to defeat the wife\u2019s rights in any assets.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
