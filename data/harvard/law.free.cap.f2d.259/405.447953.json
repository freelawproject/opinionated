Pulsation problems in gas compressor plants became serious about 1940.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In 1942, appellant created a research division to meet problems such as that of this pulsative flow and attendant vibration. Sometime in 1943, the manager of the research division called in Mr. Stephens, later the patentee, and assigned to him the problem of eliminating the trouble.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Stephens\u2019 study and research culminated in the patent in suit for which application was made on January 11, 1944. The device effectively solved the problem, and proved commercially successful.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">The district court held the claims of the patent invalid, because the device was obvious to one skilled in the art, because it was anticipated by the prior art, because all elements of the combination were old and well known and their functions produced no new, surprising or unexpected results, and because the application of an acoustic filter to a gas compressor does not constitute patentable invention. After careful study and consideration, we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-14\">Some experience and investigation were necessary to identify that the most usual source of the objectionable pressure pulsations was the intermittent gas displacements by the pistons of the compressor.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In its brief, appellant concedes, as it must, that \u201cThe compressor, being the troublemaker, of course had been known in full detail.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b455-15\">In each of the claims (footnote 2, supra) the compressor is referred to as one element of the combination patent. More <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>accurately, we think, the compressor was the source of pulsations causing the trouble intended to be corrected by the patented device. The useful part of the patent consisted solely of the dampener, the low pass acoustical filter.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">Appellant concedes also, as it must, that, \u201cAs applied to the familiar problems of sound reduction or muffling, the acoustical filter per se had been known, either actually or presumptively, to all engineers skilled in this art.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Appellant\u2019s contention, as we understand it, is that, however well known the compressor had been and however extensive had been the application of the acoustic filter to the usual purposes of sound muffling, the application of the filter to attenuate high energy gas pulsation required the exercise of the faculty of invention.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">The district court found (Finding of Fact 12, 152 F.Supp. 450) that, after being assigned to the task of eliminating the trouble, Stephens studied the prior art, particularly an article published in 1940 by Harry F. Olson, E.E., Ph.D., on \u201cElements of Acoustical Engineering,\u201d and \u201ccopied the Olson design equation and duplicated the physical form of low pass acoustic filter shown by Olson to produce the dampener shown by the patent-in-suit.\u201d A comparison of the Olson publication with the patent leaves no reasonable doubt as to the correctness of that finding. That finding teaches further that the use of so-called acoustic filters is not confined to sound muffling. The Olson article states that \u201cAcoustical and mechanical wave filters are becoming very important for use in noise reduction and control of vibration in all types of machinery and appliances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b456-14\">It is not invention to use an old process or an old machine for a new and analogous purpose.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Here the use of the old device was analogous to its former use, was taught in the prior art, and produced only the result which might have been anticipated.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> It did not involve an exercise of the inventive faculty.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> That conclusion is not negatived by evidence of unsuccessful efforts upon the part of a few others not shown to be familiar with the specific prior art,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> nor can commercial success supply the lack of invention.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A9h\">The judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"AH0T\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b454-9\">.

Mr. Fluor, appellant\u2019s president, testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-12\">\u201cA. Well, the vibration in the piping system was in evidence in every compressor plant that we had anything to do with, and because of low pressures during the early days, that is in the first part of the twenty-year period that 1 referred to, from 1920 to 1940, the pressures were low, and so as a result the vibrations caused by the pulsative flow of the gas were not too serious, and that is particularly on the low pressure plants and the smaller plants, and as a result the pulsations or vibrations of the piping could be contained, not eliminated, but the pipes could be held in place by the use of steel straps around the pipes anchoring them to the foundations on which they rested.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b455-17\">. Stephens\u2019 testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-18\">\u201cA. As I recall his conversation amounted to substantially this: \u2018With your background in mathematics, there should be some mathematical solution to this problem. I wish you would put some time toward that solution.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b455-20\">. Mr. Fluor testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-21\">\u201c * * * We built a largo truck that contained all this equipment and we started wherever there was trouble in assisting plants to make tests, and I could readily determine what was the trouble. In most cases, the vibration is caused by the pulsative flow of the gas, but it might be the whole compressor shaking or certain parts of the compressor. In some instances, we have gone in and tested and found it was not the pulsative flow of the gas that caused that particular trouble, but foundations or soil conditions were not right, and by this testing equipment we were able to put our finger, so to speak, on the trouble.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b456-6\">.
