A. Section 2255. This matter was previously before this court, and was remanded for further proceedings for the reason that the government had failed to deny an allegation that it had used perjured testimony knowingly in securing appellant\u2019s conviction. Dunn v. United States, 6 Cir., 245 F.2d 407. Other contentions now made here have been determined adversely to appellant. On numerous occasions, appellant has been before this court in proceedings that wholly lacked merit, and which indicate an abuse of judicial process on his part. See Dunn v. United States, 6 Cir., 234 F.2d 219.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-20\">Upon remand of the case for determination of the claim of the use of perjured testimony against appellant, the government filed responsive pleadings supported by numerous affidavits. The indefinite nature of the claim of the so-called perjured testimony and the lack of factual allegations as to how a certain witness was persuaded to testify falsely do not add up to use by the government, knowingly, of perjured testimony to secure appellant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-21\">The order of the district court dismissing appellant\u2019s motion to vacate sentence was not inconsistent with our directions upon remand, and is, accordingly, affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
