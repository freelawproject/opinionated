After consideration of Wellman\u2019s motion for summary judgment and the Administrator\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint or in the alternative for summary judgment, the District Court dismissed the complaint on the ground that the court lacked jurisdiction over the subject matter. Well-man then appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-13\">During World War II, Wellman was severely wounded while in combat, and having been discharged because of his disability, he received a 50 per cent disability rating. Compensation was paid to him from June 7, 1945, until May 31, 1954. On June 2, 1954, the Administrator acting through his proper subordinates notified Wellman that termination of his compensation was contemplated on the ground that he had been convicted on February 16, 1954, of the crime of conspiracy to advocate the overthrow of the Government by force and violence,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and an order of forfeiture was entered by the Administrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-14\">The Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals on May 25,1955, affirmed, holding that Well-man\u2019s conduct in furtherance of the conspiracy constituted rendering assistance to an enemy of the United States wdthin the meaning of \u00a7 4 of the Act of July 13, 1943<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This action having been commenced, the Board offered a new hearing on the question of forfeiture, and on December 31, 1956, reaffirmed its earlier decision.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It was decided, on the basis of Wellman\u2019s conviction and on the evidence \u201cin its entirety,\u201d that Wellman\u2019s participation in Communist Party activity in Michigan after 1946 and particularly during the period of the Korean conflict \u201cfrom June 27, 1950 through July 27, 1953\u201d rendered assistance to the enemy, \u201cthe enemy being identified as the North Korean Government and the Communist Government of China.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AZa\">There is no suggestion in the Board\u2019s opinion that Wellman performed any overt act in behalf of the Communist Government of China or that of North <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>Korea. The Board points to no act of Congress which declares that conspiratorial efforts by a Party member shall predicate a forfeiture of a veteran\u2019s benefits, previously lawfully awarded.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Rather the Board at some length recited evidence of Wellman\u2019s \u201cdedication to the Communist, movement.\u201d Then, taking \u201cjudicial notice\u201d of world events and the manner in other countries by which as part of an international movement the Communist Party came into power, the Board relied upon and quoted at length from the concurring opinion by Mr. Justice Jackson in Dennis v. United States.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It concluded as a matter of interpretation that \u201cassistance to an enemy\u201d as used in the forfeiture statute must be \u201cconsidered to be a general term which was intended to include all conduct knowingly performed during time of war under circumstances where the potential effect of such conduct, individually or as integral part of other activity, contemporaneous or future, would be to serve the interests of the enemy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">We are pointed to no evidence that Wellman\u2019s activity in Michigan engendered a strike in war production plants or any similar interference said to have an effect obstructive to the war effort in Korea or elsewhere. We find no claim that Wellman\u2019s Communist Party protagonism was exercised among troops to the destruction of their morale or to an interference with the enlistment program. That the Board might conclude Wellman was a dedicated Communist, before, during and after the Korean conflict we have no doubt in view of the court\u2019s opinion affirming, when his case was first on appeal.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Yet it is not suggested that all veterans of earlier wars who might similarly have been Party members thereby are subject to the forfeiture of their disability compensation for \u201crendering assistance to an enemy of the United States.\u201d While the Board says it took into account the evidence \u201cin its entirety,\u201d we are left with the abiding conclusion that the Board\u2019s action basically rested upon Wellman\u2019s Smith Act conspiracy conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-16\">That conviction had been affirmed, and so the record stood when the Administrator\u2019s motion to dismiss was granted by the District Court on June 4, 1957. But the situation has since changed. On June 17, 1957, the Supreme Court decided Yates v. United States.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The following week, certiorari was granted in Wellman v. United States,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the judgment was vacated and the case was remanded for reconsideration in the light of Yates. Thereupon the Court of Appeals reversed Wellman\u2019s conviction and a new trial has been ordered.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We think the Board should have an opportunity to reconsider the forfeiture issue in view of the developments. Accordingly, we remand to the District Court that the case may there be held in abeyance pending the Board\u2019s further consideration.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b214-17\">In passing, it may be noted that Congress has never said that membership in the Communist Party, even though active and meaningful, will ground a forfeiture of a veteran\u2019s benefit rights.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> It certainly did not say so in 1943, when as now the Soviet Union was under Communist domination. The provisions of 38 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 728 actually were in aid of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>the Soviet Union, as well as of our other allies, for a person might have been guilty of rendering assistance to <em>an enemy of the Soviet Union, </em>then our ally, and by his conduct have predicated a forfeiture under 38 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 728. The section was not limited to those who rendered assistance to an enemy of the United States. Moreover, that Congress was referring to a <em>wartime </em>\u201cenemy of the United States,\u201d one engaged in active war against us, finds corroboration by reference to 38 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 729, where the identical language occurs. There provision was made for the termination <em>by </em>statute<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> of benefits payable to alien veterans who persisted in their stay in <em>enemy territory </em>during the war, subject, however, to later reinstatement upon the filing of a de novo claim by the veteran.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">While 38 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 728 authorizes a determination by the Administrator upon \u201cevidence satisfactory to\u201d him, his ruling, as we shall develop, is not simply discretionary with him. If it depends upon an erroneous interpretation of the law, it may be subject to review by the courts. We therefore will further examine this aspect of the case. Congress here sought to equate generally, \u201cmutiny, treason, sabotage, or rendering assistance to an, enemy of the United States or of its allies\u201d as offenses tending to weaken our nation\u2019s position in the total war then being waged. Article III, \u00a7 3 of the Constitution defined \u201cTreason against the United States\u201d to \u201cconsist only in levying War against them, or in adhering to their Enemies, giving them Aid and Comfort.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In short, no person, within the meaning of 38 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 728, guilty of the proscribed offenses was, as a matter of right, to continue eligible to receive benefits from the government of the nation whose welfare and security in time of war he sought to impair. But membership in the Communist Party, whether it advocated overthrow of our Government by force and violence or not,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> was not within the purview of the section or the intent of Congress at the time.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Criminal penalties for a Smith Act violation had already therein been provided, but forfeiture of a veteran\u2019s compensation based upon service-connected disability was not included. The strict interpretation necessary as to so drastic a forfeiture statute as \u00a7 728 requires that it be limited in its application to the specific grounds spelled out by Congress, with clear proof of the overt acts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>relied upon.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Thus, if the Administrator has exceeded his authority in the determination he makes, his ruling becomes arbitrary or capricious in the legal sense. He may not deny a right which the statute creates, except for validly and legally sufficient grounds.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> That his ruling here transcended his authority seems clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">The Administrator would have us say, notwithstanding, that judicial relief is not available even if he has acted in excess of his expressed or implied powers. Not so.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> He argues that judicial review is foreclosed to this appellant. He points to \u00a7 5 of the Act of March 20, 1933<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> which, as it now appears in the Code, reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-5\">\u201cAll decisions rendered by the Administrator of Veterans\u2019 Affairs under the provisions of sections 701, 702, 703, 704, 705, 706, 707-710, 712-715, 717, 718, 720, and 721 of this title or the regulations issued pursuant thereto, shall be final and conclusive on all questions of law and fact, and no other official or court of the United States shall have jurisdiction to review by mandamus or otherwise any such decision.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AgC\">But the foregoing section was expressly made applicable by Congress<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> to the decisions of the Administrator under the provisions of the specified sections. It will be noted that 38 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 728 was <em>not </em>so included. Surely this was no oversight, for the latter section was enacted as \u00a7 4 of the very act which defined the applicability of \u00a7 1. That the omission was deliberate may be the more readily perceived from the fact that Congress accorded finality to the Administrator\u2019s decisions for such forfeitures as are commanded by 38 U.S.C. A. \u00a7 715. Thus the specific <em>inclusion </em>of the non-reviewability section as to decisions for forfeiture based upon fraud and the <em>exclusion </em>of decisions for forfeiture under \u00a7 728 manifestly reflect a clear congressional intent. In short, forfeitures based upon vitiating fraud concerning any <em>claim, </em>for benefits might administratively be finally determined, and we have so held.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b216-13\">The Administrator next argues that if 38 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 705 does not here apply, he may stand upon 38 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 lla-2<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-14\">\u201cNotwithstanding any other provisions of law, except as provided in sections 445 and 817 of this title, the decisions of the Administrator of Veterans' Affairs on any question of law or fact concerning a <em>claim, </em>for benefits or payments under any Act administered by the Veterans\u2019 Administration shall be final and conclusive and no other official or any court of the United States shall have power or jurisdiction to review any such decisions.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b216-15\">Here, it will be noted, Congress accorded finality to decisions concerning claims,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>a term which is thoroughly understood and carefully defined. We have repeatedly recognized that non-reviewability must be accorded to the Administrator\u2019s decisions as to claims.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> But we are not here concerned with a \u201cclaim\u201d by a veteran, but with action <em>by the Administrator </em>working the forfeiture of an already adjudicated award.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">We cannot doubt that ample and substantial grounds dictated the congressional intention that a veteran\u2019s service-connected disability compensation was not to be forfeited by virtue of an unreviewable decision in the agency that a veteran was guilty of so serious an offense as treason or rendering assistance to the enemy in time of war. Moreover, we are entirely satisfied that Congress recognized that there is a very real distinction between a decision as to a <em>claim </em><footnotemark>25</footnotemark> initiated by a veteran and a decision by the Administrator as to action commenced <em>by him </em>under 38 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 728.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Clearly, it is not every action by the Administrator which has been accorded by Congress the status of nonreviewability.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">We have said enough to indicate our appraisal of Wellman\u2019s status and the rights he has sought to vindicate.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> We think the Administrator should have an opportunity to reconsider his action, and for now we need go no farther than to remand the case to the District Court. We expect that it there may again be held in abeyance pending the Administrator\u2019s reconsideration in the light of our observations. We are confident that such reconsideration will seem to be quite in order since Wellman\u2019s Smith Act conviction has been reversed, and since the record is barren of fact or incident to indicate that Wellman in Michigan performed any overt act which rendered assistance to the Communist governments of China and of North Korea.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-16\">Vacated and remanded accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-17\">BASTIAN, Circuit Judge, concurs in the result.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b213-10\">.

But unless and until that happens, he is entitled to prompt payment of all moneys due him.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
