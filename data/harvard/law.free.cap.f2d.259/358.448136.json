Large volume purchases of merchandise are made by the company in California and its principal transportation problem lies in the one-way haul of groceries from California to points of distribution in the other western states. This appeal searches the question of whether or not Utah Wholesale is functioning as a private carrier in accomplishing the interstate haul through contractual relations with the other appellants, William Reid Lamb and Glen C. Poynor, d/b/a Poynor <em>&amp; </em>Lamb Trucking,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and Load Service, Incorporated.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The action was initiated by the Interstate Commerce Commission in the District Court for the District of Utah upon allegation that the Trucking Co. was unlawfully engaged as a carrier in interstate commerce. Jurisdiction is admitted under 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 322(b) and Utah Wholesale and Load Service are parties under the authority of 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 42. The trial court, having concluded that the arrangements between appellants constituted an unlawful subterfuge to evade regulation by the Interstate Commerce Commission, granted injunctive relief. The entire matter was submitted to the District Court upon a written stipulation of facts. The trial court\u2019s conclusions and findings of ultimate fact are therefore based entirely upon consideration of the stipulated operative facts. In recognition of the importance of the question involved and the necessity of a complete consideration of the operative facts we set out in full the material paragraphs of the stipulation as Appendix A.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-16\">The parties agreed at pre-trial that the determinative and only question to be submitted to the trial court was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>\u201cWho, in truth and in fact, was doing the transportation, Poynor and Lamb, who owned the trucks, \u2022or Utah Wholesale Grocery, who wanted its goods shipped?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">The trial court found from the stipulated facts that the purpose of defendants in entering into the agreements was to attempt to avoid application of Part II of the Interstate Commerce Act.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It held that defendants\u2019 acts were an unlawful subterfuge; that the agreed facts of their manner of operation contradicted the written instruments and agreements; that Utah Wholesale was not a private carrier under the Act; that Load Service was not a bona fide agent of Utah Wholesale; that the drivers were not Utah Wholesale employees; that the trucks were never in its possession and control; that the parties had not changed the manner of their operation sufficient to avoid application of the Act; and that Poynor and Lamb were in fact engaged in transporting goods in interstate commerce for compensation in violation of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">Upon appeal, the issue remains the same. Simply stated, it is who was transporting the goods in question. Since the legal classification of appellants as typed carriers under the Interstate Commerce Act is a question of law, Scott v. I. C. C., 10 Cir., 213 F.2d 300, 302, to be determined by the factual answer to that question we must first consider the effect to be given in this court to a finding of ultimate fact made by the trial court which is dependent entirely upon consideration of stipulated and undisputed basic facts. It is immediately apparent that in the instant case this court is in as good a position as the trial judge to evaluate the stipulated facts and we have oft-tinaes stated that in such case .it is our duty to do so. See United States v. Corporation of the President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, 10 Cir., 101 F.2d 156; British America Assur. Co. of Toronto, Canada v. Bowen, 10 Cir., 134 F.2d 256, and cases cited. But our duty to evaluate the facts does not extend to the right or duty to make an independent evaluation without regard to the findings below. Such would be, in cases such as the instant one, a trial de novo and would effectively destroy a paramount function and responsibility of the trial court. Rather, Rule 52(a), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A. contemplates that the scope of appellate review is enlarged in such cases to the extent, and only to the extent, that no regard need be given to the opportunity of the trial court to observe the witness. Skinner v. Parnell, 10 Cir., 257 F.2d 345. Although the findings of the trial court and the inferences and conclusions to be drawn therefrom are not entrenched with finality, Rule 52(a) is applicable to our review, United States v. U. S. Gypsum Co., 333 U.S. 364, 68 S.Ct. 525, 542, 92 L.Ed. 746, and the findings should not be disturbed unless found to be \u201cclearly erroneous.\u201d To be so disturbed the reviewing court must be \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d United States v. U. S. Gypsum Co., supra. We thus must affirm the trial court unless our evaluation\u2019 of the stipulated facts leaves us with the firm conviction that a mistake has been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">In order to effectuate the regulatory purposes of the Interstate Commerce Act the provisions of that Act should be liberally construed. In A. W. Stickle &amp; Co. v. I. C. C., 10 Cir., 128 F.2d 155, 160, certiorari denied 317 U. S. 650, 63 S.Ct. 46, 87 L.Ed. 523, this court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-9\">\u201cA carrier may not avoid the requirements of Part II, supra, by subterfuge or device, or by posing as a private carrier when, in substance and reality, he is engaged under individual contracts in transportation by motor vehicle of property in interstate commerce for compensation. Ownership of the commodity transported is not the sole test. The primary test in \u00a7\u00a7 203(a) (14) and 203(a) (15) [49 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>U.S.C.A. \u00a7 303(a) (14, 15)] is transportation for compensation.\u201d (Footnotes omitted.) 128 F.2d 160.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">The court further stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-6\">\u201cWhat the court said in Georgia Truck System, Inc., v. Interstate Commerce Commission, 5 Cir., 123 F.2d 210, 212, is apposite:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-7\">\u201c \u2018We need not indulge here in any of these refinements. It is sufficient for us to say that the invoked statute is a highly remedial one, that its terms are broadly comprehensive enough to bring within them all of those who, no matter what form they use, are in substance engaged in the business of interstate or foreign transportation of property on the public highways for hire.\u2019 \u201d 128 F.2d 160.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">In the Fifth Circuit case cited the contention was made, as here, that the carrier was but leasing motor vehicles and was not engaged in transportation. The court held the contention to be valid in form only. We believe that to be equally true in the instant case. The history of Poynor and Lamb Trucking shows that its essential business is that of transportation, not the rental of motor vehicles. Nor is it a natural function of Utah Wholesale to transport bulk wheat from points in the mountain states to market in California. Utah Wholesale admittedly needs but one transportation service: drayage of its merchandise from California to distribution points in other states. This need could undoubtedly be lawfully met by Utah Wholesale through its actual operation of leased trucks. But the need cannot be filled, free of I. C. C. regulation, by a trucking company performing every single operative function of a contract carrier under the guise of a lease which, though purporting to give form to a five-year period, is destroyed in substance by a provision allowing contractual escape, without cause, by either party, upon fifteen days\u2019 notice. Such an arrangement has no substance and lends support to the view that the lease arrangement is but a component part of an over-all plan to frustrate the purposes of interstate commerce regulation through un-permitted evasion rather than by bona fide avoidance of the provisions of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-12\">In 1955 and continuing until the initiation of this action the integration of the plan to unify an operation in interstate commerce was emphasized by the common ownership and operation of the Trucking Co. and Load Service. Changes have since been made so that Load Service is now independent of the Trucking Co. in both ownership and management. This is a step in the right direction, Interstate Commerce Comm. v. Vincze, D.C., 151 F.Supp. 449, but is insufficient to raise the over-all plan to one of bona fide substance.'</p>\n<p id=\"b409-13\">Since we do not entertain a firm conviction that a mistake has been committed the judgment of the trial court is accordingly affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-14\">Appendix A</p>\n<p id=\"and-dedup-0\">Stipulation of Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b409-15\">I. On the dates alleged in the complaint and at all times thereafter, William Reid Lamb and Glen C. Poynor were the owners either individually or as owners in common of over the road motor vehicles and operated during the time mentioned in the complaint as Poy-nor and Lamb Trucking.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-16\">II. That Utah Wholesale Grocery Co., is a corporation engaged in the business of wholesale grocery sales in the States of Nevada, Washington, Idaho, and Montana, and purchases large volumes of its merchandise in the State of California. That A. B. Smith is the general manager and an executive officer of said corporation in charge of its business.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-17\">III. Load Service, Incorporated, is a corporation formed in 1955 by William Reid Lamb and Glen C. Poynor, who owned the majority of stock and the controlling interest of the corporation. It was organized for the purpose, among others, of dealing as a broker, and arranging for the transportation by motor vehicles of commodities exempt from regulation under Part II of the Interstate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>Commerce Act, and to give services to shippers and transporters of such exempt commodities. That no authority or licenses is required by the said Interstate Commerce Act to engage in such operations or business. That William Reid Lamb was active in the management of both the truck use of Poynor and Lamb Trucking and Load Service, Incorporated, at all times mentioned in the complaint, as hereinafter set forth.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">IV. That on or about March 28, 1955; June 6, 1955; and 26 of April, 1955, Poynor and Lamb executed instruments entitled \u201cLease of Motor Vehicle Equipment\u201d eleven vehicles, consisting of tractor and trailers, were referred to and described therein. Said instruments are attached hereto as exhibits and marked \u201cA\u201d, \u201cB\u201d, and \u201cC\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">V. That Poynor and Lamb or Load Service, Incorporated, or any of the individuals interested in said defendants had any authority from the Interstate Commerce Commission to engage in the transportation of property in interstate commerce by motor vehicle for compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">VI. That all of the property transported and the transportation referred to in the complaint was transportation in interstate commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">VII. That for a long time prior to the formation of Load Service, Incorporated, Poynor and Lamb Trucking was engaged in the business of transporting on the trucks of Poynor and Lamb exempt commodities in interstate commerce, by motor vehicles, for compensation, and William Reid Lamb was well acquainted with the demand for and customers who required and availed themselves of such transportation as shippers.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">VIII. That the defendant, Utah Wholesale Grocery Company, always had truck loads of merchandise, consisting of several shipments, in the bay area, such as Oakland and San Francisco, California, for delivery by motor vehicle to points in Utah, Idaho, Washington, and Montana. In order to transport these shipments from the bay area to the Utah area on the trucks owned by Poy-nor and Lamb, referred to in exhibits \u201cA\u201d, \u201cB\u201d, and \u201cC\u201d, it was necessary to obtain a load of exempt commodities to transport for compensation, from the Utah Idaho territory to the bay area.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-10\">IX. That under the arrangement between the parties defendant in the performance of the transportation alleged in the complaint, the following plan was followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-11\">William Reid Lamb would solicit and locate a load of an exempt commodity (wheat) to be transported from Malta, Idaho, to South Vallejo, California. He notified Utah Wholesale Grocery Co. the date of the transportation. He dispatched a truck described in exhibit \u201cA\u201d, \u201cB\u201d, or \u201cC\u201d, selected and assigned the driver to drive the truck and generally advanced the two drivers $150 expense money. Also he furnished the drivers daily driver\u2019s logs and an envelope with the number of the tractor and trailer. The truck proceeded from Salt Lake City, Utah, to Malta, Idaho, where it was loaded with wheat for Hines &amp; Co., a grain dealer. The wheat was delivered by the drivers at S. Vallejo, California, and thereafter, the drivers, if they had not been directed by William Reid Lamb, at Salt Lake City, where to go, would be advised by him where merchandise of the Utah Wholesale Grocery should be picked up and loaded in Oakland or San Francisco. The drivers would proceed to the designated points and load the truck with canned goods and other merchandise, pick up the invoices and deliver it to the Utah Wholesale Grocery house designated as the delivery point. The drivers made driver\u2019s logs on the trip and showed thereon Utah Wholesale Grocery as the carrier, also the trip expense envelope showing the name of Utah Wholesale Grocery Co. was filled out showing the trip made, and road expense incurred, and receipts for expenses paid in cash during said trip. These were turned in to William Reid Lamb or Juanita Hurd, a joint employee bookkeeper for Load Service, Incorporated, and Poynor and Lamb Trucking. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>Load Service would prepare a freight bill and statement showing that Utah Wholesale Grocery transported for Hines &amp; Co. a load of wheat from Malta, Idaho, to General Mills at So. Vallejo, California, and show the charges made for the transportation plus the transportation tax of 3'% on the freight charges. The Hines &amp; Co. issued a check payable to the Utah Wholesale Grocery Co. in the amount of the charges, and transmitted the check to Load Service, Incorporated. Receipt of the check and the amount was entered in the accounts of Load Service, and then the check was forwarded to Utah Wholesale Grocery Co., who endorsed it and deposited it in its bank account. Load Service, Inc., prepared an invoice showing the actual mileage of the loaded and unloaded truck on the complete trip from Salt Lake to Malta to Oakland to Salt Lake showing a charge of 21 cents per mile or other agreed mileage. This invoice showed the amount to be paid the drivers and who the drivers were on the trip. The Utah Wholesale Grocery issued checks to the drivers in the amount shown on the invoice, and deducted therefrom all withholding tax. The drivers were all paid on a trip basis. The drivers\u2019 checks were delivered to Load Service or William Reid Lamb and he delivered the checks to the drivers. The trip expense envelope, receipts of cash expenditures on the trip and the drivers\u2019 logs and drivers\u2019 qualification certificates were delivered by Load Service to the Utah Wholesale Grocery Co. At intervals a statement was delivered by Poynor and Lamb to the Wholesale Grocery Company covering several invoices with a description of the trip, the mileage for each trip, the rate per mile, and the Utah Wholesale issued a check for the amount due, and made payment of the expenses recorded on the trip expense envelope to either Poynor and Lamb or Load Service, Inc., depending on who made the expense advance to the drivers.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">X. The representative trip under the arrangement disclosed the following information :</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">(1) Invoice to Utah Wholesale Grocery for trip 214.</p>\n<p id=\"Ad0\">Salt Lake to Malta 163 miles</p>\n<p id=\"A-n\">Malta to Oakland 774 miles</p>\n<p id=\"AA8\">Oakland to Salt Lake 745 miles</p>\n<p id=\"agz-dedup-0\">Salt Lake to Ogden and return 76 miles</p>\n<p id=\"Aq9X\">1758 miles @ 21 cents\u2014 $369.18</p>\n<p id=\"aqa-dedup-1\">Driver Perry 72.50</p>\n<p id=\"adh-dedup-1\">Driver Sweek 72.50</p>\n<p id=\"ArMp\">(2) Invoice from Load Service to Hines &amp; Co. for #42120 wheat for So.

If there were split deliveries or more than one pickup, the total amount of mileage was charged and paid for by Utah Wholesale Grocery.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-21\">XI. All incidental or necessary help and needs such as dock loaders, warehouse help, icing of cargo were arranged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>for by Loading Service, Inc., or the drivers and reported to Load Service, Inc., which entered the services rendered in its account, and made a' charge for such services and for arranging for the load of exempt commodities, which charges have not been paid. At least 1000 trips have been made under the arrangements described herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">XII. All repairs on the trucks were .made and paid for by Poynor and Lamb, and the trucks when not in use were kept at the garage of Poynor and Lamb and were delivered to their garage by the drivers at the end of the completed trip.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">! XIII.

B. Smith was called as a witness, he would testify that carriers authorized by the Interstate Commerce Commission operating between the points involved herein cannot and will not give, the service required by Utah Wholesale\" at a cost that makes any such service available, and that at any cost common carrier service is not fast enough for his needs.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">XV. That at all times since the filing of the complaint in this case and at the present time William Reid Lamb and Glen C. Poynor have and now own trucks for operations over the highway as owners' in common or as individuals, and that Utah Wholesale Grocery Company did not own trucks by which it transports property in the territory involved herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-9\">Paragraph \u201cB\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"amq-dedup-0\">That the defendant would offer in evidence as to present operations copy of instrument entitled \u201cLease of Motor Ve-hide Equipment\u201d attached hereto and marked exhibit \u201cD\u201d, a copy of an instrument entitled \u201cAgreement\u201d between Utah Wholesale Grocery Co. and Load Service, Inc., attached hereto and marked exhibit \u201cE\u201d, and copies of statements rendered between the parties marked exhibits \u201cF\u201d and \u201cG\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-11\">Paragraph \u201cC\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b412-12\">That the Public Liability and Property Damage insurance is carried in the name of and paid for by Utah Wholesale Grocery Co. with the owner of the trucks named as an insured.</p>\n<p id=\"Apg\">Paragraph \u201cD\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b412-14\">That the services performed-by Wil- \u2022 liam Reid Lamb set forth in Paragraph 9 of this Stipulation is now being performed by Load.
