A Government agent testified that he first saw Williams and two other men standing by a parked car in front of Williams\u2019 store; that the three walked to the rear of his store where they stayed for a minute or so, and that they then walked back to the car together. On this walk McKinley Jones, one of the men, was carrying an open box in his arms. Jones put the box on the ground, opened the trunk of the car and deposited the box therein. All of this was done in Williams\u2019 presence. The two others then entered the automobile and drove away.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-19\">The agent followed the car and, when he stopped it some distance away, he found in the trunk the cardboard box which he had seen carried from Williams\u2019 store, and in that box was a five-gallon jar of \u201cmoonshine\u201d whiskey. Returning to the store, the officer observed two similar empty five-gallon jugs being placed by Williams in another car. The officer later found two such jugs between Williams\u2019 store and his house behind the store.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-20\">We perceive no error in the submission of this evidence to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-21\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
