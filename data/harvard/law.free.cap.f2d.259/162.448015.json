Appellant Bryan filed a civil action in that court against ap-pellee Groff \u201cto reform note and other relief.\u201d Groff filed a motion for summary judgment, and it was set for hearing. Counsel for Bryan was not present when the motion was called. The court granted the motion. A date, two days thereafter, was set fo;? the presentation of a formal order granting summary judgment. Counsel for Bryan was duly notified. Another attorney appeared and informed the court that Mr. Bryan was not then present because he was engaged in a case in Virginia, and that Mr. Bryan\u2019s failure to appear at the hearing on the motion was due to his engagement in another court. The District Court entered judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-11\">Although Mr. Bryan tells us that he informed the assignment commissioner of his conflicting engagements, he at no time took steps to inform the court or the clerk of the court. We find no abuse of discretion on the part of the trial court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b211-16\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b211-13\">. Rule 9(d) of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia reads as follows: \u201cIf at the time set for hearing there be no appearance for the moving party the court may treat the motion as submitted or waived, or continue or strike it from the motion calendar. If there be no appearance for the opposing side, it may be treated as conceded.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
