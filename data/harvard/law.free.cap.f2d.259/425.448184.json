The narrow question to be decided is whether O\u2019Meara\u2019s delivery of oil to the Texas Company, by pipe line, to be credited to McDonald\u2019s account,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> was payment to McDonald in accordance with the agreement between the parties. The district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>found no genuine issue as to any material fact. The court granted defendants\u2019 motions for a summary judgment and dismissed the suit as to all defendants. We affirm this judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">May 7, 1955, Philip J. Daspit granted a mineral lease to McDonald covering certain property on Timbalier Island in Terrebonne Parish, Louisiana. A month later McDonald subleased to O\u2019Meara, but reserved an overriding royalty of one-eighth of the oil, gas, and other minerals produced. O\u2019Meara completed his first well December 7, 1955 and later brought in three more wells.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">Sometime before Daspit leased to McDonald, Felix Broussard leased the same property to Tidewater Associated Oil Company. To settle the ownership, Das-pit sued Broussard. During this litigation O\u2019Meara continued to drill and to operate the property, but because of uncertainty as to the outcome of the suit, he withheld payment of the royalty until May 31, 1956. On that date he entered into an escrow agreement with McDonald. The agreement required O\u2019Meara to make payments to the Citizens National Bank &amp; Trust Company of Houma, Louisiana, in escrow, pending final determination of the Daspit v. Broussard suit. May 22, 1957 final judgment was rendered recognizing Daspit\u2019s ownership.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">From the completion of the first well, December 7, 1955, until January 23, 1957, because there was no pipe line connection at Timbalier Island, O\u2019Meara barged the oil, selling at the point of barge delivery. O\u2019Meara deposited with the escrow agent the amount due McDonald as his royalty for the period from December 7, 1955 to January .23, 1957. In the meantime, Texas Company constructed a pipe line to Timbalier Island, attaching it to O\u2019Meara\u2019s wells January 23, 1957. After that date O\u2019Meara made no further deposits to the escrow agent, since all of the oil produced was delivered to the Texas Company. The Texas Company prepared a division order recognizing McDonald\u2019s royalty interest. McDonald has refused to execute this division order and has allowed his share of the oil proceeds to remain with the Texas Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-9\">McDonald contends that O\u2019Meara\u2019s failure to continue making deposits in escrow violated the sublease and is good ground for cancellation of the sublease. McDonald filed suit to cancel before the termination of the Daspit v. Broussard litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-11\">The original mineral lease from Daspit to McDonald contains the following provision for payment of royalty to the lessor: \u201cOil royalties shall be delivered to Lessor free of expense at Lessor\u2019s option <em>in tanks furnished by Lessor at the well or to Lessor\u2019s credit in any pipe line connected therewith. </em>In the event Lessor does not furnish tanks for such royalty oil and no pipe line is connected with the well, Lessee may sell Lessor\u2019s royalty oil at the best market price obtainable and pay Lessor the price received f.o.b. the leased property, less any severance or production tax imposed thereon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b474-12\">The sublease to O\u2019Meara stipulated that McDonald\u2019s overriding royalty should be paid in the same manner as provided for in the original lease: \u201cAssignor reserves to himself a one-eighth (%) of eight-eighths (%) overriding royalty out of all the oil, gas and other minerals produced, saved and marketed from the hereinabove described property; said overriding royalty shall be free of all cost to Assignor, and subject only to Assignor\u2019s proportionate share of the severance taxes which shall be due and payable thereon. <em>Said overriding royalty shall be paid and/or delivered in the same manner as provided in said lease for royalties of the Lessors therein.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b474-13\">Under the terms of the lease and sublease, therefore, O\u2019Meara\u2019s delivery of the oil to the pipe line, constituted delivery of the overriding royalty to McDonald. There is no doubt that delivery to a pipe line purchaser is the usual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>and preferred method of marketing oil. It is undisputed that all of the oil produced after January 23, 1957 was delivered to the Texas Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">McDonald claims that the escrow agreement had the effect of amending the sublease, and that O\u2019Meara\u2019s failure to continue payments to the escrow agent after January 23, 1957 therefore was a violation of the sublease.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">It is unnecessary to determine whether the escrow agreement operated as an amendment to the sublease or as a separate contract. We read the escrow agreement as continuing during the Daspit v. Broussard litigation but as limited in its effect to the period when O\u2019Meara was barging oil, selling it, and handling the entire proceeds. The parties never intended the escrow to apply to the period when the oil would be delivered to a pipe line purchaser and O\u2019Meara would have no funds in his hands belonging to McDonald to be deposited with the escrow agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">The purpose and scope of the escrow agreement are clear enough. During the time O\u2019Meara was barging the oil and selling it, he was accumulating a considerable sum of money. McDonald objected to O\u2019Meara\u2019s possession of the money during the litigation over title. For O\u2019Meara the purpose of the escrow was to put the royalty in the hands of a stakeholder until title could be determined. For McDonald the purpose was to protect his royalty while O\u2019Meara was handling large sums derived from sales of the oil.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">The agreement obligates O\u2019Meara to deposit with the Houma bank the proceeds from one-eighth of the oil, \u201cless severance taxes and cost of collection, which O\u2019Meara has previously sold\u201d. Then, \u201cO\u2019Meara shall continue to purchase and run the oil claimed by McDonald\u201d, depositing McDonald\u2019s portion \u201cless severance taxes and costs of transportation\u201d. McDonald \u201ctakes cognizance of the necessity of barging said oil by the present purchaser\u201d. It seems to us, therefore, that the escrow dealt with a temporary situation and had meaning only as long as O\u2019Meara was barging and selling the oil at the point of barge delivery, and had McDonald\u2019s funds in his hands. The lease and sublease clearly contemplate marketing of oil through a pipe line purchaser as standard operating procedure; failure to take advantage of the Texas Company pipe line to Timbalier would have exposed O\u2019Meara to possible liability for not protecting the lessor\u2019s interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-10\">When final judgment was rendered in Daspit v. Broussard, May 22, 1957, the escrow by its terms ended. McDonald withdrew all of the proceeds representing his overriding royalty from the beginning of production to January 23, 1957. Proceeds due him after January 23, 1957 are being held for his account by the Texas Company, in accordance with the express terms of the sublease and lease. O\u2019Meara\u2019s delivery by pipe line to the Texas Company of all the oil produced under the lease, with a proper credit to McDonald\u2019s account of his royalty interest, constituted payment to McDonald. O\u2019Meara has done all that he was obligated to do under his agreements with his lessor.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-12\">November 23, 1956, O\u2019Meara purchased the mineral lease that Tidewater had acquired from Broussard. McDonald alleges that (1) the acquisition was concealed from him; (2) that,\" in effect, the acquisition perfected title to McDonald\u2019s lease from Daspit, since a lessee cannot dispute his lessor\u2019s title; (3) that O\u2019Meara was placed in the position of having to pay McDonald immediately for the overriding royalty reserved on the Daspit lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-14\">There is no merit to these contentions. (1) The Tidewater lease was recorded on the public records of Terrebonne six months before McDonald filed suit. (2) Under the terms of the O\u2019Meara sublease from McDonald the \u201cLessee shall have the right to purchase a lease or leases from others to protect its leasehold rights and shall not thereby be held to have disputed Lessor\u2019s title; and, in the event Lessor\u2019s title or interest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>therein is claimed by others, Lessee shall have the right to withhold payment of royalties or deposit such royalties in the registry of the Court until final determination of Lessor\u2019s rights.\u201d (3) At the time of O\u2019Meara's purchase of the Tidewater lease the Daspit-Brous-sard action was still pending. O\u2019Meara had put himself in the position of protecting his leasehold, but there was uncertainty as to which lease was valid. He was justified therefore in continuing to make deposits as provided in the escrow agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">We have considered the contentions of the Appellant\u2019s resourceful counsel in addition to those referred to in this opinion. There may be more to this case than meets the eye, as implied in the briefs and oral argument. But we are limited to what we find out in the open. The judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b473-13\">. McDonald brought suit in the District Court for the Parish of Terrebonne, Louisiana. Suit was removed to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana. McDonald joined as defendants the First City National Bank of Houston and T. W. Archer, who hold mortgages secured by O\u2019Meara\u2019s interest in the lease. Louisiana Land and Exploration, that holds a one-thirty-second overriding royalty from O\u2019Meara, also was named as defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b473-30\">. The Texas Company held the oil in a suspense account. The Texas Company-prepared division orders which were distributed to O\u2019Meara and the other owners of the oil. McDonald refused to execute his division order to obtain his share of the oil produced and sold to The Texas. Company.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
