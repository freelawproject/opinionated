New Cut Rate Liquors, 245 F.2d 453, we held that, in such a case, if defendant challenges plaintiff\u2019s allegations of jurisdictional facts, the burden is upon plaintiff to support those allegations by competent proof. The question now before us is whether the competent proof submitted in the case at bar was sufficient to sustain plaintiff\u2019s burden of establishing that the jurisdictional amount is involved. In Seagram-Distillers, at page 458, we referred to witness Lind, produced by plaintiff there. We quoted his testimony that, in a price war in the liquor market,.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-16\">\u201c * * * our product is subject to loss, and our business has been injured, <em>because we can measure it, </em>because we can see what happens to us in every jurisdiction where there is a price break.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-17\">We pointed out</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-18\">\u201cThe measure to which he referred was not otherwise identified or produced in court. Whether the measure was accurate we do not know. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-19\">In the case at bar Lind testified for plaintiff (referring to defendants\u2019\u2019 stores), as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-20\">\u201c \u00ae * * that with these stores, the 19 stores, cutting at the rate of 60 cents per bottle or more that within a period of three months to six months the Calvert sales in the metropolitan Chicago area will go down by at least 40 per cent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-21\">\u201cI compute that on the basis of the same similar situations that have existed before in New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Florida, and Louisiana.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-22\">He also testified as to the average monthly sales of plaintiff and the profit per case and reached a mathematical conclu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>sion that plaintiff\u2019s losses would be \u201cin the neighborhood of $22,500 per month within 3 to 6 months\u201d. However, the \u201csituations\u201d in the named states, to which Lind referred, did not involve plaintiff\u2019s products. Defendants argue that plaintiff has never suffered any loss as a result of price-cutting on its products, but has rested its case solely on speculation as to what happened to an unrelated brand over 17 years ago. When asked specifically by plaintiff\u2019s counsel \u201cDo you have any examples involving plaintiff\u2019s products, Calvert\u2019s in particular?\u201d, Lind answered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-5\">\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think there are any cases where we have allowed our prices to go that way.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">Moreover, plaintiff\u2019s counsel, at the time of trial, told the district court,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-7\">\u201c * * * <em>we make no claim that we can measure any specific loss which has occurred so far.\u201d </em>(Italics supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">Actually plaintiff, prior to the time of the trial below, had had an experience in Chicago during a considerable period when defendants allegedly were unlawfully cutting the retail prices on plaintiff\u2019s products. Its complaint shows such price-cutting started as early as February 8, 1957 and continued to the time of the trial on June 27 and 28, 1957. This was a period of over four months. If this experience of price-cutting had demonstrated that plaintiff suffered any damage as a result thereof, it could have readily shown that fact by evidence. If it could not produce evidence of such actual <em>past </em>damage, we fail to see how the opinion testimony of Lind (and two other witnesses) proves the minimum jurisdictional requirement of threatened <em>future </em>damage. The admission by plaintiff\u2019s counsel that \u201c * * * we make no claim that we can measure any specific loss, <em>which has occurred so far.\u201d </em>makes unconvincing plaintiff\u2019s contention that it met its burden of proving the measure in dollars of its loss likely to result <em>in the future </em>from defendants\u2019 acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-10\">The district court denied a motion of plaintiff for a rehearing of a prior order adverse to plaintiff. In the later order the court expressed the opinion, <em>inter alia, </em>that \u201cthe evidence of damages allegedly suffered and to be suffered in loss of future sales and deterioration of brands is speculative, remote and uncertain, and therefore insufficient to meet the requirements for injunctive relief or to satisfy the jurisdictional amount.\u201d' From both orders plaintiff has appealed. For want of proof of jurisdiction, those orders are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-11\">Orders affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b372-12\">. \u00a7\u00a7 188-191, chap. 121%, Illinois Revised Statutes, 1957.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b372-23\">. 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1331.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b373-12\">FINNEGAN, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b373-13\">I filed a dissent to the majority opinion reported as Seagram-Distillers Corp. v.
