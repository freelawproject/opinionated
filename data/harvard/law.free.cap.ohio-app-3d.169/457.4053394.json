Jones\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>vehicle, a 1987 GMC S-15 truck, broadsided the ear driven by Sara Blake. As a result, Blake\u2019s vehicle rotated and collided with a vehicle driven by Shauna Williams. Jones and Blake died as a result of the collision, and Williams sustained bodily injuries. Both Blake and Williams were minors. At the time of the accident, Blake\u2019s vehicle was covered by an uninsured/underinsured motorist policy with Allstate Insurance Company (\u201cAllstate\u201d). Williams\u2019s vehicle was covered under a policy with State Farm Insurance Company (\u201cState Farm\u201d). Jones had an automobile insurance policy with Progressive, although the truck he was driving was not listed on the policy. At that time, the truck was titled in the name of Bill Adams d.b.a. Bill Adams Auto Sales. Bill Adams Auto Sales had a policy of insurance with Auto-Owners.</p>\n<p id=\"AnU\">{\u00b6 4} On July 6, 2001, Blake\u2019s mother, Amy Iker, both individually and as the administrator of Blake\u2019s estate, and Russell Blake, Blake\u2019s father (collectively, \u201cIker\u201d), brought a wrongful death action against Jones\u2019s estate. They also brought claims against Bill Adams (\u201cAdams\u201d) and Bill Adams Auto Sales, alleging that Adams was the owner of the truck that Jones had driven and that he had negligently loaned the truck to Jones. In an amended complaint, Iker added several insurance companies as defendants, including Allstate and Auto-Owners.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">{\u00b6 5} On October 15, 2002, Williams and her parents filed a personal injury suit against Jones\u2019s estate, Bill Adams Auto Sales, Adams, and Iker. Williams also subsequently added several insurance companies as defendants, including Auto-Owners, Progressive, and State Farm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On November 7, 2002, the two cases were consolidated.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">{\u00b6 6} In 2003, the court granted summary judgment to Adams and Bill Adams Auto Sales, concluding that although a genuine issue of material fact existed regarding who owned the 1987 GMC S-15 truck, they were entitled to summary judgment on the negligent entrustment and respondeat superior claims against them. At the time of trial, Jones\u2019s estate, Auto-Owners, Progressive, and State Farm were the only remaining defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">{\u00b6 7} On December 6, 2004, Auto-Owners filed a motion to bifurcate the issue of insurance coverage from the negligence claims. The court granted the motion on February 16, 2005. On March 21, 2005, the court heard testimony on the ownership of the vehicle that Jones had driven, which was the only contested issue of fact relevant to insurance coverage. Jones\u2019s estate, Williams, and State Farm did not participate in the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>{\u00b6 8} On June 14, 2005, the court ruled that Adams had sold the truck to Jones and that Jones had taken possession of it. Applying the Ohio Uniform Commercial Code (\u201cUCC\u201d), R.C. Chapter 1302, the court concluded that Jones thus owned the S-15 truck on October 17, 2000, and consequently the vehicle was not covered by the Auto-Owners policy issued to Adams. The court further found that because Jones had failed to place the truck on his Progressive policy, the vehicle was not covered under that policy at the time of the accident. The court thus granted judgment in favor of Auto-Owners and Progressive. Iker and Williams appeal from that ruling, raising six assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">{\u00b6 9} Before turning to the assignments of error, we must address whether Williams has standing to appeal from the trial court\u2019s ruling. As noted by Auto-Owners, Williams did not participate in the trial at her request. Auto-Owners thus argues that Williams has waived her right to contest the trial court\u2019s ruling. Williams responds that in the name of judicial economy, it was \u201cperfectly appropriate for one of the Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel to take the lead in trying the case. In this instance it was Plaintiff Iker\u2019s counsel.\u201d Upon review of the record, we agree with Auto-Owners that Williams waived her objections by failing to participate at trial. We find nothing in the record to support Williams\u2019s contention that Iker was acting on her behalf at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">{\u00b6 10} Turning to the assignments of error, we note that Iker contends that the issue before the trial court was simply competing claims of ownership or, in this case, lack of ownership. In reality, the trial court\u2019s inquiry involved a two-step process. First, the trial court was required to determine whether Adams had sold, rather than loaned, the truck to Jones. Second, if the court made the threshold finding that Adams had sold the vehicle to Jones (which it did), it was then required to determine who owned the vehicle for purposes of insurance coverage. Iker\u2019s assignments of error touch on both of these steps, and we will address them in an order that facilitates our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">{\u00b6 11} VI. \u201cThe trial court\u2019s judgment is against the manifest weight of the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">{\u00b6 12} In her sixth assignment of error, Iker claims that the trial court\u2019s conclusion that Adams had sold the S-15 pickup truck to Jones was against the manifest weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-9\">{\u00b6 13} In reviewing a claim that the judgment is not supported by the evidence, we are guided by the holding that \u201cjudgments supported by some competent, credible evidence going to all the essential elements of the case will not be reversed by a reviewing court as being against the manifest weight of the evidence.\u201d <em>C.E. Morris Co. v. Foley Constr. Co. </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 279, 8 O.O.3d 261, 376 N.E.2d 578, syllabus; see <em>Lykins v. Miami Valley Hosp., </em>157 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>Ohio App.3d 291, 2004-Ohio-2732, 811 N.E.2d 124, at \u00b6 112. \u201cFurthermore, we must presume that the findings of the trier of fact are correct because the trier of fact is best able to observe the witnesses and use those observations in weighing the credibility of the testimony.\u201d <em>Lykins, </em>citing <em>Seasons Coal Co. v. Cleveland </em>(1984), 10 Ohio St.3d 77, 81, 10 OBR 408, 461 N.E.2d 1273.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">{\u00b6 14} According to the evidence and stipulations presented at trial, Dale Jones was an auto mechanic who operated a repair shop, as a sole proprietor, in a building leased from Bill Adams Auto Sales for $300 per month. The building was located at the rear of Adams\u2019s lot, and Jones routinely performed mechanical work on Adams\u2019s vehicles. Bill Adams Auto Sales buys and sells used cars. Jones had previously purchased at least two vehicles from Bill Adams Auto Sales: (1) a red 1986 Chevrolet S-10 pickup truck, for which Bill Adams had obtained a security agreement, and (2) a 1985 Chevrolet Suburban.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Both of those vehicles were insured by Jones\u2019s policy with Progressive.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">{\u00b6 15} According to the parties\u2019 stipulations, Jones executed a written sales agreement (Used Vehicle Order form) with Bill Adams Auto Sales for the GMC S-15 pickup on May 11, 2000. He took possession of the S-15 immediately after executing the sales agreement. At the time of the October 17, 2000 accident, the certificate of title to the S-15 pickup was still in the name of Bill Adams Auto Sales. Although not the subject of a stipulation, it is undisputed that an insurance card for the policy issued by Auto-Owners to Bill Adams d.b.a. Bill Adams Auto Sales was found in Jones\u2019s wallet at the time of the accident. Jones had not requested that the S-15 pickup identified in the sales agreement between Bill Adams Auto Sales and Dale Jones be insured under his Progressive policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">{\u00b6 16} At trial, Adams testified that he and Jones did not generally exchange money for the services that Jones rendered and for the amounts that Jones owed him, such as for rent, parts, and vehicles purchased. Rather, the two men kept a \u201crunning account\u201d of what was owed, and they settled up on occasion at Jones\u2019s request. Adams indicated that he always owed money to Jones. He further stated that he had used a security agreement for the purchase of the S-10 because that had been the first vehicle that he had sold Jones, but that he did not require a security agreement for subsequent sales to Jones.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>{\u00b6 17} Addressing the purchase of the S-15 pickup, Adams testified that Jones had decided to buy the truck when the motor \u201cblew\u201d on his S-10. Adams completed the Used Vehicle Order form for the S-15, as he would with any vehicle that he sold. He testified that payment for the vehicle was probably taken off the running tab, per their typical arrangement. Adams testified that Jones had the only keys to the S-15 and that he considered the pickup to belong to Jones after the agreement was signed. Adams did not authorize Jones to use dealer license plates on the S-15 after that point, and he was not aware that they were being used. To the contrary, Adams testified that he had observed Jones put the license plates for his S-10 onto the S-15. Adams admitted that he held the title to the truck at the time of the accident, but that Jones had stated that he was considering giving the truck to this son. Adams testified that he also had not transferred title on the date of purchase when Jones purchased the Suburban. Adams denied that he loaned vehicles. Addressing Kelly Jones\u2019s assertion that she had borrowed a vehicle from him, Adams testified that Jones had arranged for Kelly to purchase a vehicle but that she had returned the vehicle the next day when Jones discovered that her prior car could be repaired.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">{\u00b6 18} In contrast, Kelly Jones, Jones\u2019s daughter, testified that her father had stated that the S-15 pickup was being loaned to him while his S-10 pickup was being repaired. Kelly found parts to repair the S-10 after Jones\u2019s death. Kelly indicated that she had asked to borrow the S-15 sometime in May or June, but that her father had not allowed it because the truck belonged to Adams. She further testified that she had borrowed a 1999 Chevrolet Baretta from Bill Adams Auto Sales in August 2000, and that she was required to execute a Used Vehicle Order form for that vehicle. Kelly testified that she had had the Baretta for a few days and returned the vehicle to Bill Adams Auto Sales. Kelly denied that she had purchased the Baretta.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">{\u00b6 19} Upon review of the Used Vehicle Order form for the S-15 pickup, Kelly testified that she did believe that the signature on the bottom looked like her father\u2019s signature. She stated that she was not aware of any payments that he made for the truck and that the truck had dealer license plates on it at the time of the accident. She testified that the S-10 and the Suburban did not have dealer tags.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">{\u00b6 20} In its June 14, 2005 judgment, the trial court credited the testimony provided by Adams. The court found his testimony \u201cvery telling as to the relationship between Mr. Jones and Mr. Adams\u201d and concluded that the two men were friends. The court credited Adams\u2019s testimony as to the course of dealing between Jones and him, and concluded that Jones had purchased the S-15 from Adams in their customary manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>{\u00b6 21} Upon review of the record, we find ample support for that conclusion. Although the trial court could have credited Kelly\u2019s testimony that Bill Adams loaned vehicles and that her father had merely borrowed the S-15 pickup (and the two Used Vehicle Order forms for the Suburban lend some credence to that assertion), we cannot conclude that the court lost its way when it chose to believe Adams and found otherwise. Moreover, although the transaction apparently was not conducted in accordance with all of the statutory requirements, the court could have reasonably concluded that a sale occurred despite those irregularities. Considering the evidence that Adams and Jones kept a running account and that there had not been a security agreement on the Suburban, it was reasonable for the trial court to conclude that the S-15 pickup had been purchased in this manner as well. In sum, although the court could have reasonably concluded that a sale did not occur, the trial court\u2019s conclusion that Jones purchased the S-15 pickup from Adams was not against the manifest weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">{\u00b6 22} The sixth assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">{\u00b6 23} I. \u201cThe trial court improperly applied the Uniform Commercial Code rather than the Ohio Certificate of Title Act to determine competing ownership claims regarding the 1987 GMC S-15 truck.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">{\u00b6 24} In her first assignment of error, Iker claims that the trial court should have used the Ohio Certificate of Motor Vehicle Title Act, R.C. Chapter 4505, to determine the ownership of the truck driven by Jones. In determining whether Jones was the owner of the vehicle for purposes of insurance coverage, the trial court applied the UCC, R.C. Chapter 1302.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">{\u00b6 25} We will begin our analysis with the Ohio Certificate of Motor Vehicle Title Act. Pursuant to R.C. 4505.04(B), no court \u201cshall recognize the right, title, claim, or interest of any person in or to any motor vehicle sold or disposed of, or mortgaged or encumbered\u201d unless evidenced by a certificate of title, by admission in the pleadings, by stipulation of the parties, or by an instrument showing a valid security interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-9\">{\u00b6 26} The Supreme Court has stated that R.C. 4505.04 applies where parties assert competing rights or competing interests in a motor vehicle. See, e.g., <em>State v. Rhodes </em>(1982), 2 Ohio St.3d 74, 75, 2 OBR 629, 442 N.E.2d 1299. \u201cR.C. 4505.04 was intended to apply to litigation where the parties were rival claimants to title, i.e., ownership of the automobile; to contests between the alleged owner and lien claimants; to litigation between the owner holding the valid certificate of title and one holding a stolen, forged or otherwise invalidly issued certificate of title; and to similar situations.\u201d <em>Hughes v. Al </em>Green, <em>Inc. </em>(1981), 65 Ohio St.2d 110, 115-116, 19 O.O.3d 307, 418 N.E.2d 1355, quoting <em>Grogan Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc. v. Gottfried </em>(1978), 59 Ohio App.2d 91, 94, 13 O.O.3d 154, 392 N.E.2d 1283.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>{\u00b6 27} Over time, the Supreme Court has carved out several exceptions to the applicability of R.C. 4505.04. See, e.g., <em>State v. Shimits </em>(1984), 10 Ohio St.3d 83, 10 OBR 413, 461 N.E.2d 1278 (forfeiture case); <em>Hughes, </em>supra (risk <em>of </em>loss). In <em>Hughes, </em>the Supreme Court held that R.C. 4505.04 does not apply to the issue of risk of loss and that such cases were governed by the UCC. In <em>Smith v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1988), 37 Ohio St.3d 150, 524 N.E.2d 507, the court held that the criteria in R.C. 1302.42(B), not R.C. 4505.04, must be used to identify the owner of a vehicle for purposes of determining insurance coverage in case of an accident. In that ease, the original owner, Frances, gave the vehicle to her son, Charles, who purchased insurance for the vehicle. The vehicle, however, remained titled in Frances\u2019s name. Charles then sold the vehicle to Smith. Although Smith was given the title after the sale, Frances\u2019s signature had not been notarized as required by R.C. 4505.07. Smith was subsequently injured in an accident and sued Charles\u2019s insurer, claiming that the underinsured motorist provision in Charles\u2019s policy covered his damages. Applying the Certificate of Title Act, the trial court and the court of appeals both held that Frances\u2019s assignment of title was invalid and that Smith was entitled to summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">{\u00b6 28} Following <em>Hughes, </em>the Supreme Court reversed, stating:</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">{\u00b629} \u201cAlthough Hughes involved another U.C.C. section, we hold that the thesis underlying that decision is applicable here. Indeed, it is apparent that R.C. 4505.04 is irrelevant to all issues of ownership except those regarding the importation of vehicles, rights as between lienholders, rights of bona-fide purchasers, and instruments evidencing title and ownership. Otherwise, motor vehicle ownership rights will be determined by the Uniform Commercial Code. After the owner is identified, claims to insurance benefits attach to the owner\u2019s insurer. Thus, we hold that the criteria found in R.C. 1302.42(B), and not the Certificate of Title Act, identify the owner of a motor vehicle for purposes of determining insurance coverage in case of an accident. In this case, Roger Smith was clearly the owner of the motor vehicle under the U.C.C. test. Therefore, the Smiths have no claim for benefits under [Charles\u2019s] policy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">{\u00b6 30} As noted by Iker, since <em>Smith, </em>the Supreme Court has held that a proper transfer of title to the purchaser is required in order for the purchaser to obtain a recognizable interest in the automobile. <em>Saturn of Kings Automall, Inc. v. Mike Albert Leasing, Inc. </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 513, 518, 751 N.E.2d 1019. In <em>Saturn, </em>two dealers held title to automobiles that were sold to Gallatin, another dealer. Gallatin was permitted to obtain possession of the vehicles prior to paying for the vehicles, but the dealers retained the titles to the vehicles pending receipt of payment. Gallatin subsequently sold the vehicles to Albert Leasing, Inc. and received payment for them. However, Gallatin failed to remit payment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>to the two dealers. Consequently, the dealers sought replevin of the vehicles and damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">{\u00b6 31} On appeal to the Supreme Court, the parties disputed whether the action was governed by R.C. 4505.04 or the UCC, particularly R.C. 1302.44, which addresses entrustment. The court concluded that \u201c[i]n determining competing claims of ownership of a motor vehicle, R.C. 4505.04(A) controls over the provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code.\u201d Id. at syllabus. Applying that statute to the facts, the court ruled that because the dealerships had retained the certificates of title and they had never been assigned to Gallatin, Gallatin had never been the lawful owner of the vehicles. Thus, Gallatin could not pass title to the purchasers.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">{\u00b6 32} Recently, the Supreme Court of Ohio again applied the Certificate of Motor Vehicle Title Act, rather than the UCC, to determine ownership when there were conflicting claims to the vehicle. The Supreme Court held that \u201c[w]hen an individual acquires a motor vehicle using a counterfeit check and sells the vehicle to a purchaser, R.C. 4505.04 determines who possesses valid title to the motor vehicle.\u201d <em>Allan Nott Ents., Inc. v. Nicholas Starr Auto, L.L.C., </em>110 Ohio St.3d 112, 2006-Ohio-3819, 851 N.E.2d 479.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">{\u00b6 33} In our view, the Supreme Court\u2019s recent opinions in <em>Saturn </em>and <em>Allan Nott </em>do not alter the continued vitality of <em>Smith. </em>Neither <em>Saturn </em>nor <em>Allan Nott </em>concerned risk of loss or insurance coverage, and neither overruled <em>Smith. </em>To the contrary, in <em>Saturn, </em>the Supreme Court expressly distinguished its factual circumstances from <em>Hughes </em>and <em>Smith, </em>stating:</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">{\u00b6 34} \u201cThe issues presented in <em>Hughes </em>and <em>Smith </em>were not the same as the issue before the court in this matter. In <em>Hughes </em>and in <em>Smith, </em>the court was asked to decide whether the Ohio Certificate of Title Act or the Ohio UCC controlled in order to identify the owners of motor vehicles for purposes of determining which party was responsible for the risk of loss <em>(Hughes) </em>and insurance coverage (Smith) for damages that occurred to a motor vehicle prior to the lawful transfer of title.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">{\u00b6 35} \u201cWe are once again called upon to decide, upon the facts before us, whether Ohio\u2019s Certificate of Motor Vehicle Title Law or Ohio\u2019s UCC applies. In <em>Hughes </em>and in <em>Smith, </em>however, it bears repeating that the issues were risk of loss and insurance coverage. Conversely, the question now before us involves competing claims of ownership of three motor vehicles. Here, contractual rights between the parties are not at issue.\u201d <em>Saturn, </em>92 Ohio St.3d at 518, 751 N.E.2d 1019.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-9\">{\u00b6 36} In the present case, we agree with the trial court that the UCC provided the proper means to determine Auto-Owners\u2019 and Progressive\u2019s coverage obli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>gations. Although Iker claims that this action involves competing claims of ownership, this action does not involve rival claimants to title or other similar situations. Rather, as in <em>Smith, </em>the trial court was asked to identify the owner of a vehicle for purposes of determining insurance coverage when an accident occurred. Accordingly, pursuant to <em>Smith, </em>R.C. 1302.42 applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">{\u00b6 37} The first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">{\u00b6 38} II. \u201cThe trial court incorrectly applied Ohio Revised Code Provision Section 1302.42(B) when it should have applied Ohio Revised Code Provision Section 1302.42(C).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">{\u00b6 39} III. \u201cThe trial court mis-applied Ohio Revised Code Provision Section 1302.42(B).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">{\u00b6 40} In her second and third assignments of error, Iker claims that the trial court incorrectly employed R.C. 1302.42(B) rather than R.C. 1302.42(C). Iker argues, in the alternative, that the court misapplied R.C. 1302.42(B) even if it controls.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-9\">{\u00b6 41} R.C. 1302.42 states:</p>\n<p id=\"b499-10\">{\u00b6 42} \u201c(B) Unless otherwise explicitly agreed, title passes to the buyer at the time and place at which the seller completes performance with reference to the physical delivery of the goods, despite any reservation of a security interest and even though a document of title is to be delivered at a different time or place</p>\n<p id=\"b499-11\">{\u00b6 43} \u201c(C) Unless otherwise explicitly agreed where delivery is to be made without moving the goods:</p>\n<p id=\"b499-12\">{\u00b6 44} \u201c(1) If the seller is to deliver a document of title, title passes at the time when and the place where the seller delivers the documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-13\">{\u00b6 45} \u201c(2) If the goods are at the time of contracting already identified and no documents are to be delivered, title passes at the time and place of contracting.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b499-14\">{\u00b6 46} In support of her assertion that the trial court should have applied R.C. 1302.42(C), Iker relies upon <em>Grange Mut. Cas. Co. v. Smith </em>(1992), 80 Ohio App.3d 426, 609 N.E.2d 585. In <em>Grange, </em>Smith sold a Chevrolet Impala to his stepdaughter, Palmer, who had been using the vehicle and had possession of it. Before Smith transferred the title to Palmer, Palmer\u2019s flane\u00e9 was involved in an accident while driving the car. The trial court concluded that, because Palmer already had possession of the car, R.C. 1302.42(C) applied to the transaction. The court thus concluded that because Smith had the title, Smith still owned the vehicle on the date of the accident. Relying upon the Official Comments to UCC 2-401, the Fourth District Court of Appeals affirmed the use of R.C. 1302.42(C). The appellate court also concluded that although the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number><em>Smith </em>had applied R.C. 1302.42(B), the court was not precluded from applying R.C. 1302.42(C). The Fourth District noted that the Supreme Court had applied R.C. 1302.42(B) because it was the relevant section of the UCC for those factual circumstances. The court of appeals thus concluded that because the stepdaughter had possession of the Impala at the time of the contract for sale, the trial court did not err in determining that R.C. 1302.42(C) applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">{\u00b6 47} We find <em>Grange </em>to be inapposite to the present circumstances. Here, the parties stipulated that Jones executed a written sales agreement with Bill Adams Auto Sales for the GMC S-15 pickup on May 11, 2000, which the trial court concluded indicated a sale. The parties further stipulated that Jones took possession of the S-15 immediately after executing the sales agreement. Adams testified that Jones had the only keys to the vehicle and that he considered the truck to belong to Jones after the sales agreement was signed. Based on the evidence, the contract contemplated a physical delivery of the truck from Adams to Jones, which in fact occurred immediately after executing the written contract. Unlike the stepdaughter in <em>Grange, </em>Jones was not in possession of the pickup prior to the contract. Accordingly, the trial court properly applied R.C. 1302.42(B) rather than R.C. 1302.42(C). See, also, <em>Wilson v. Brooks </em>(June 28, 1999), Butler App. Nos. CA98-06-123, CA98-06-132, 1999 WL 459571.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">{\u00b6 48} As an alternative argument, Iker asserts that the trial court misapplied R.C. 1302.42(B) by failing to consider the language of the Used Vehicle Order form. In particular, she cites paragraph 2A of the preprinted conditions on the back of the form, which states: \u201cWe the dealer will deliver to the purchaser the title to the purchased used vehicle free and clear of all liens and encumbrances upon full payment of the purchase price.\u201d Iker argues that this paragraph constitutes an \u201cexplicit agreement\u201d that title would pass to Jones upon payment in full and not before.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">{\u00b6 49} We find nothing ambiguous in the language of paragraph 2A. In light of the fact that paragraph 2A refers to the \u201cdelivery\u201d of \u201cthe title,\u201d paragraph 2A is more properly construed as referring to the delivery of a document of title rather than of the ownership interest. In our view, paragraph 2A does not constitute an agreement that affected when title, in the sense of ownership, passed to the buyer under R.C. 1302.42(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">{\u00b6 50} The second and third assignments of error are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-9\">{\u00b6 51} IV. \u201cThe trial court erred when it overruled the appellant\u2019s objections to hearsay testimony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b500-10\">{\u00b6 52} In her fourth assignment of error, Iker argues that the trial court erroneously overruled objections to hearsay statements from Jones. In response, Progressive argues that Iker failed to identify where in the transcript such errors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>occurred, as required by App.R. 16(A), and that her assignment of error should be disregarded. Auto-Owners and Progressive further assert that any error by the trial court was harmless, because the court\u2019s ruling was based on other competent, credible evidence. In her reply brief, Iker provides citations to the transcript for nine occurrences where statements by Jones were admitted over objection. While we agree with Progressive that Iker\u2019s brief failed to cite the record in accordance with App.R. 16, we have chosen, in our discretion, to address the merits of her argument based on the citations that she belatedly provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">{\u00b6 53} In her reply brief, Iker cites several instances in which Adams testified to alleged statements by Jones related to Jones\u2019s intentions to purchase the S-15 pickup from him and the arrangements for that purchase, including why title was not immediately transferred, whether Jones had purchased insurance for the S-15, and whether he had arranged for license plates for the S-15. Adams\u2019s testimony that Jones approached him about purchasing the vehicle, his description of the arrangements for payment, and his recollection that he saw Jones put license plates from the red S-10 on the S-15 are descriptions of Adams\u2019s observations of Jones\u2019s actions, not statements by Jones. Accordingly, that testimony does not constitute hearsay. Adams\u2019s testimony that Jones told him he had not decided what to do with the S-15 and that he was considering giving the truck to his son were not offered for the truth of Jones\u2019s intentions for the S-15 truck; rather, they were offered to explain the reasons that Adams did not transfer title to Jones immediately after he signed the sales agreement. Accordingly, those statements are also not inadmissible hearsay. Finally, Adams testified that Jones stated that he had put the S-15 truck on his insurance policy. Although this statement constitutes hearsay, we find it to be harmless. The parties stipulated that Jones did not request that the S-15 truck be placed on his insurance with Progressive, and there was substantial additional evidence from which the trial court could conclude that Jones purchased the S-15 pickup from Adams.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">{\u00b6 54} The fourth assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">{\u00b6 55} V. \u201cAuto Owners and Progressive should not benefit from their insured\u2019s unclean hands.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">{\u00b6 56} In her fifth assignment of error, Iker claims that Adams and Jones violated several provisions of R.C. Title 45 during the alleged sale of the truck to Jones. Iker contends that as a result of these violations, Adams and Jones should be denied the benefits of a declaratory judgment under the doctrine of unclean hands.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>{\u00b6 57} Although Iker focuses on Adams\u2019s and Jones\u2019s conduct, Adams had been dismissed from the litigation and is not a party to the declaratory judgment action. Moreover, the parties have stipulated that Iker would not seek to satisfy a judgment against Jones\u2019s estate and Adams. Accordingly, Adams and the estate were not affected \u2014 either positively or negatively \u2014 by the court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">{\u00b6 58} Moreover, we emphasize that the parties involved in the trial sought a declaratory judgment as to the responsibilities of the insurance companies with whom Adams and Jones had policies. Iker provides no authority for imputing the alleged misconduct of Adams and Jones to the insurance companies, and we are aware of none. To the contrary, violations of R.C. Title 45 are generally irrelevant to the determination of ownership for purposes of insurance. See <em>Smith </em>and <em>Wilson, </em>supra. We find no basis to conclude that Auto-Owners and Progressive should be precluded from a judgment in their favor under the doctrine of unclean hands.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">{\u00b6 59} The fifth assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">{\u00b6 60} Having overruled all of the assignments of error, the judgment of the trial court will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b502-8\">Donovan and Walters, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b502-9\">Sumner E.

The insurers for the employers of Amy Iker, Williams, and Williams\u2019s parents were also named as defendants. Pursuant to <em>Westfield Ins. Co. v. Galatis, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 216, 2003-Ohio-5849, 797 N.E.2d 1256, the trial court ultimately granted summary judgment to these insurers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b494-7\">. According to the index to the stipulated joint exhibits, Exhibit D represented the Used Vehicle Order form, dated March 8, 1999, for the Suburban, whereas Exhibit E represented the Used Vehicle Order form, dated March 20, 1998, for the Chevy S-10. Exhibit E, however, states that the vehicle model is \"K20\u201d, not \"S10.\" Upon review of those exhibits, we find it clear that both forms refer to the same vehicle, the Suburban. The VIN for the vehicles is the same on both forms and, upon reviewing the Progressive policy declarations page (Exhibit J), we see that K20 refers to a Suburban. It is undisputed, however, that Jones bought an S-10 truck and a Suburban from Adams.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
