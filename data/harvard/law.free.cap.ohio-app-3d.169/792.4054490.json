Plaintiff-appellee and cross-appellant, Margie Burnell, cross-appeals. We affirm in part and reverse in part the judgment and remand the cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-10\">{\u00b6 2} On March 22, 2004, Deputy Sheriff Brian Dulle of the Warren County Sheriffs Office was on duty. That afternoon, Deputy Dulle was driving to the Lebanon Municipal Court to testify in response to a subpoena. The subpoena called Deputy Dulle to testify as a witness in a case involving a motorist whom he had investigated and cited in connection with an automobile accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-11\">{\u00b6 3} Deputy Dulle proceeded through the parking lot of the Lebanon Municipal Building, and the cruiser\u2019s flashing lights and sirens were off. There is a dispute as to his rate of speed. Burnell alleges that Deputy Dufle\u2019s vehicle approached her at an excessive rate of speed; Deputy Dulle estimates his speed at 5 mph. Deputy Dulle turned towards a parking spot designated for police vehicles. His view was partially obstructed by a large van parked at the end of the row of cars. His view was also hindered by sun glare. As he was turning, Deputy Dulle\u2019s cruiser knocked Burnell down and ran over her foot, causing injuries. He backed the vehicle up two to three feet to release Burnell\u2019s foot. According to Deputy Dulle\u2019s deposition, he did not see Burnell prior to the collision. Burnell stated that she saw Deputy Dulle\u2019s vehicle approaching, but did not have time to get out of the way.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>{\u00b6 4} In December 2004, Burnell filed a complaint against the Warren County defendants alleging negligence on the part of Deputy Dulle and seeking damages. Warren County filed a motion for summary judgment in November 2005. In a decision dated January 8, 2006, the trial court partially granted the motion. The court\u2019s decision found that Deputy Dulle was shielded from liability by sovereign immunity, but refused to hold the Warren County Commissioners and the Warren County Sheriffs Office immune. Warren County timely appealed, raising a single assignment error. Burnell cross-appealed, also raising a single assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">{\u00b6 5} A trial court\u2019s decision on summary judgment is reviewed de novo. <em>Burgess v. Tackas </em>(1998), 125 Ohio App.3d 294, 296, 708 N.E.2d 285. Summary judgment is proper when there are no genuine issues of material fact, the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and reasonable minds can only come to a conclusion adverse to the nonmoving party, construing the evidence most strongly in the that party\u2019s favor. Civ.R. 56(C). See, also, <em>Harless v. Willis Day Warehousing Co. </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 64, 66, 8 O.O.3d 73, 375 N.E.2d 46. The moving party bears the initial burden of informing the court of the basis for the motion and demonstrating the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. <em>Dresher v. Burt </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 280, 293, 662 N.E.2d 264. If the moving party meets its burden, the nonmoving party has a reciprocal burden to set forth specific facts showing a genuine issue for trial. Id. We are mindful of the rule\u2019s provisions in reviewing the assignments of error that follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-6\">{\u00b6 6} Assignment of error No. 1:</p>\n<p id=\"b826-7\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cThe trial court erred by refusing to grant summary judgment for defendants-appellants * * * pursuant to R.C. 2744.02(b)(1)(a) by finding that Deputy Sheriff Brian Dulle was not on a \u2018call to duty\u2019 while driving to testify pursuant to subpoena when the accident occurred.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b826-8\">{\u00b6 8} Warren County argues that it is entitled to immunity because Deputy Dulle, in traveling to the courthouse to testify in his capacity as a police officer and pursuant to a subpoena, was \u201cresponding to an emergency\u201d as contemplated by R.C. 2744.02(B)(1)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b826-9\">{\u00b6 9} R.C. Chapter 2744 establishes a three-tiered analysis for determining whether a political subdivision is immune from tort liability. <em>Grooms v. Crawford, </em>Butler App. Nos. CA2005-05-008 and CA2005-05-009, 2005-Ohio-7028, 2005 WL 3588422, \u00b6 11. First, R.C. 2744.02(A) establishes the general rule that a political subdivision is immune from liability for acts or omissions connected with governmental or proprietary functions. Second, this general immunity is revoked if the exception in R.C. 2744.02(B)(1) applies, subject to the defenses in R.C. 2744.02(B)(1)(a) through (c). Third, if a political subdivision is exposed to liability by virtue of the provisions of R.C. 2744.02, R.C. 2744.03(A) provides defenses to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>certain specific conduct that the political subdivision may assert, again subject to the limitations of R.C. 2744.03(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">{\u00b6 10} Regarding the first tier of the analysis, it is not disputed that the Warren County defendants (Warren County Sheriff Tom Ariss, the Warren County Sheriffs Office, and the Warren County Board of Commissioners) are included in the term \u201cpolitical subdivision.\u201d See R.C. 2744.01(F). In addition, as an on-duty police officer, Deputy Dulle was engaged in a \u201cgovernmental function\u201d at the time of the accident. See R.C. 2744.01(C)(2)(a). Thus, the general rule of immunity, R.C. 2744.02(A), applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">{\u00b6 11} The second tier of the analysis requires a court to determine whether any of the exceptions to immunity apply. The trial court determined that this case involved the negligent operation of a motor vehicle, triggering the exception in R.C. 2744.02(B)(1):</p>\n<p id=\"b827-7\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cExcept as otherwise provided in this division, political subdivisions are liable for injury, death, or loss to person or property caused by the negligent operation of any motor vehicle by their employees when the employees are engaged within the scope of their employment and authority.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b827-8\">{\u00b6 13} Warren County does not challenge the applicability of this exception to the present matter. Rather, Warren County argues that it is immune from liability under R.C. 2744.02(B)(1) by virtue of the full-defense provisions of R.C. 2744.02(B)(1)(a) through (c). When liability is to be imposed based upon negligent operation of a motor vehicle by a government employee, R.C. 2744.02(B)(1)(a) through (c) provide three full defenses. Warren County refers to the defense precluding liability when \u201c[a] member of a municipal corporation police department or any other police agency was operating a motor vehicle <em>while responding to an emergency call </em>and the operation of the vehicle did not constitute willful or wanton misconduct.\u201d (Emphasis added.) R.C. 2744.02(B)(1)(a). An \u201cemergency\u201d call is defined as \u201ca call to duty, including, but not limited to, communications from citizens, police dispatches, and personal observations by peace officers of inherently dangerous situations that demand an immediate response on the part of a peace officer.\u201d R.C. 2744.01(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b827-10\">{\u00b6 14} On appeal, Warren County argues that a police officer en route to court to testify under subpoena is, by definition, on an emergency call under the immunity statute. The trial court rejected the argument that Deputy Dulle was on an emergency call when the accident occurred. We agree with the trial court\u2019s ruling on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-11\">{\u00b6 15} The fact that Deputy Dulle was an on-duty police officer driving to court to testify at the time of the incident does not make this an emergency call. We recognize that the Ohio Supreme Court held that an \u201cemergency call\u201d is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>limited to inherently dangerous situations that demand an immediate response. See <em>Colbert v. Cleveland, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 215, 2003-Ohio-3319, 790 N.E.2d 781, \u00b6 11-15. The high court held that an \u201cemergency call\u201d as defined in R.C. 2744.01(A) \u201cinvolves a situation to which a response by a peace officer is required by the officer\u2019s professional obligation.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 15. But we do not find that the <em>Colbert </em>court\u2019s analysis requires that the phrase \u201cemergency call\u201d be so broadly construed as to encompass the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">{\u00b6 16} It was not Deputy Dulle\u2019s professional duty, but his civic duty, to respond to the subpoena. The fact that the subject matter of his testimony involved the officer\u2019s official duties does not render driving to the city building to testify about the subject an emergency call. Deputy Dulle\u2019s professional obligations were not engaged while he was driving to the courthouse. Thus, this case is distinguishable from those cited by Warren County for support of its argument. See, e.g., <em>Cunningham v. Akron, </em>Summit App. No. 22818, 2006-Ohio-519, 2006 WL 290100; <em>Rutledge v. O\u2019Toole, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 84843, 2005-Ohio-1010, 2005 WL 563727; <em>Kintyhtt v. Barberton, </em>Summit App. No. 22468, 2005-Ohio-3799, 2005 WL 1763606.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-6\">{\u00b6 17} We conclude that the trial court properly denied summary judgment in favor of the Warren County Commissioners and the Warren County Sheriffs Office on the basis that the officer was not responding to an emergency call. While Deputy Dulle was on duty at the time of the accident, he was correctly determined by the trial court not to be on an emergency call at this time, as is required by R.C. 2744.02(B)(1)(a) for immunity under that section. Warren County\u2019s first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-7\">{\u00b6 18} Cross-Assignment of error No. 1:</p>\n<p id=\"b828-8\">{\u00b6 19} \u201cThe trial court erred in finding that Deputy Dulle was not liable for willful or wanton misconduct as a matter of law and in granting his motion for summary judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b828-9\">{\u00b6 20} Burnell maintains that there is ample evidence in the record to give rise to a material question of fact whether Deputy Dulle was acting recklessly when the accident occurred. Burnell asserts that this question of fact precludes summary judgment in his favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-10\">{\u00b6 21} After finding that Deputy Dulle negligently operated his police cruiser while on duty but not responding to an emergency call, the trial court determined that he was not guilty of any willful or wanton misconduct. The court held Deputy Dulle immune from liability under R.C. 2744.03(A)(6). This statute provides a general grant of immunity to an employee of a political subdivision unless one of the following applies: (1) the employee\u2019s acts or omissions were manifestly outside the scope of his employment or official responsibilities, (2) the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>employee\u2019s acts or omissions were performed with malicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a wanton or reckless manner, or (3) civil liability is expressly imposed by statute. Burnell challenges Deputy Dulle\u2019s right to sovereign immunity based upon the second of these three exceptions, wanton and reckless conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-4\">{\u00b6 22} Whether a person acted in a reckless and wanton manner is usually a question of fact for the jury. <em>Fabrey v. McDonald Village Police Dept. </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 351, 356, 639 N.E.2d 31. Deputy Dulle conceded that he was driving with an obstructed view due to the sun and the parked van and that he did not see Burnell until after the collision. As stated, there is a factual dispute regarding Deputy Dulle\u2019s speed at the time of the accident. In her deposition, Burnell stated that Deputy Dulle \u201cwas so close, he hit me in a couple seconds. I didn\u2019t have time to move.\u201d But Deputy Dulle claimed that he was \u201ccreeping,\u201d and estimated his speed at 5 mph (he was only able to provide an estimate because his speedometer did not register at speeds below 10 mph).</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">{\u00b6 23} As the nonmovant, the evidence must be construed in Burnell\u2019s favor. Because reasonable minds could come to different conclusions regarding whether Deputy Dulle\u2019s conduct rose to the level of recklessness or wantonness, the trial court erred in awarding summary judgment to Deputy Dulle.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">{\u00b6 24} Burnell\u2019s cross-assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-7\">{\u00b6 25} Having overruled Warren County\u2019s assignment of error and sustained Burnell\u2019s cross-assignment of error, we affirm the portion of the trial court decision denying summary judgment to the Warren County Commissioners and the Warren County Sheriffs Office. We reverse the portion of the trial court decision granting summary judgment to Deputy Dulle. We remand the cause to the trial court for further proceedings according to law and consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-8\">Affirmed in part and reversed in part, and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b829-9\">Powell, P.J., and Bressler, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
