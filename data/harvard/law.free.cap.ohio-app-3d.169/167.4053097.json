The court found that in light of the Ohio Constitution\u2019s new Article XV, Section 11 (\u201cIssue I\u201d), the state could not pursue a conviction against Kvasne for the offense of domestic violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-11\">{\u00b6 2} The state argues that the trial court wrongly dismissed the first count of the indictment, because R.C. 2919.25 remains constitutional in spite of the passage of Issue I.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-12\">{\u00b6 3} Kvasne has filed a cross-appeal to challenge the state\u2019s appeal and, further, to challenge both his conviction on the second count of the indictment for abduction and the sentence imposed therefor.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-13\">{\u00b6 4} He initially asserts that the state\u2019s appeal should be dismissed. Moreover, he claims in his five cross-assignments of error that his abduction conviction should be reversed because it is sustained by neither sufficient evidence nor the weight of the evidence in that abduction is not a lesser included offense of the crime alleged in the indictment, kidnapping. He also claims that the trial court failed to permit him to present the testimony of one of his defense witnesses. He additionally claims that his sentence of more than the minimum term is unsupported in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>{\u00b6 5} After a review of the record, this court agrees with the state\u2019s argument. This court previously has held that R.C. 2919.25 is neither incompatible with Issue I nor unconstitutional in light of it. <em>State v. Burk, </em>164 Ohio App.3d 740, 2005-Ohio-6727, 843 N.E.2d 1254; <em>State v. Douglas, </em>Cuyahoga App. Nos. 86567 and 86568, 2006-Ohio-2343, 2006 WL 1304860. Consequently, that portion of the trial court\u2019s order is reversed, and the cause is remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">{\u00b6 6} Kvasne\u2019s assertions and claims lack merit. His conviction for abduction and the sentence imposed for that conviction, therefore, are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">{\u00b6 7} This case results from an altercation that occurred between Kvasne and the victim, D.J.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> D.J. testified that beginning in the summer of 2003, she and Kvasne shared a romantic relationship as \u201cboyfriend\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and girlfriend. Although Kvasne worked most weekdays at a job in Michigan, he returned to Cleveland on weekends to live with her in her home.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">{\u00b6 8} The romantic portion of the relationship ended in December 2004, but Kvasne continued to live there. D.J. indicated that pursuant to their usual living arrangement, she continued to pay most of the expenses, but he contributed to the household by giving her money for incidentals and by making home repairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">{\u00b6 9} In February 2005, D.J. asked Kvasne to find another place to live \u201cby springtime.\u201d She testified that on the evening of February 5, he arrived at home angry. Apparently, he had been thinking about her request but \u201ccouldn\u2019t accept that.\u201d He indicated that he believed she \u201chad taken advantage of him because he put the furnace in,\u201d which had cost him a significant amount of money.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-9\">{\u00b6 10} D.J. testified that although she attempted to walk away from the argument, Kvasne started to \u201cpush [her] around.\u201d After she nearly fell into a piece of furniture, he grabbed her arms and shoved her onto her knees. She retaliated by \u201cgrabb[ing] him by the crotch of his pants.\u201d He \u201cjumped backwards\u201d to avoid her hands, then forcefully \u201cpoked\u201d her with all the fingers of his hand, jamming them as a unit into the side of her face in the area of her jaw.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-10\">{\u00b6 11} When she indicated that his action hurt, he stated that it \u201cwas just a poke\u201d; he proceeded to demonstrate that he could have done more damage if he wished by throwing her down, straddling her, and with his left hand, pinning her arms to the floor over her head. He then \u201cslapped [her] in the side of [her] face with his right hand.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b202-11\">{\u00b6 12} D.J. threatened to call the police. Kvasne responded that he would remain where he was until she withdrew her threat. After about a minute, she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>relented. At that point, he permitted her to stand. In order to keep peace with him thereafter, she acted as if the argument was over.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">{\u00b6 13} A few days later, when Kvasne resumed working, she removed his personal belongings from her home and changed the locks so that he could not use his key. Furthermore, she decided to file a criminal complaint against him so that he would not seek to return.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">{\u00b6 14} Kvasne eventually was indicted on two counts. Count one charged him with domestic violence in violation of R.C. 2919.25; count two charged him with kidnapping in violation of R.C. 2905.01. The indictment contained both a notice of prior conviction and a repeat-violent-offender specification for his 1985 conviction for the crime of voluntary manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">{\u00b6 15} Kvasne entered a written waiver of his right to a jury trial; therefore, the trial court acted as the trier-of-fact. Kvasne stipulated to the fact of his prior conviction. At the conclusion of the proceeding, the trial court dismissed count one, finding that under the circumstances of the facts proved in the case, Ohio\u2019s \u201cnew constitutional amendment\u201d precluded a conviction of Kvasne pursuant to R.C. 2919.25. As to count two, over his objection, the court found Kvasne not guilty of kidnapping, but guilty of the \u201clesser included\u201d offense of abduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">{\u00b6 16} The court ultimately sentenced Kvasne on his conviction for abduction to a two-year prison term.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-9\">{\u00b6 17} Pursuant to R.C. 2945.67(A), the state filed an appeal of the trial court\u2019s dismissal of count one of the indictment against Kvasne. Kvasne has filed a cross-appeal, in which he claims that the trial court actually acquitted him of the domestic-violence charge. Additionally, he challenges his conviction for abduction and the sentence imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-10\">{\u00b6 18} In its appeal, the state presents the following assignment of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b203-11\">{\u00b6 19} \u201cI. The trial court erred when it dismissed Count One of the indictment based on Ohio Constitution Section XV, Article 11 [sic], Issue I.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b203-12\">{\u00b6 20} Kvasne counters the state\u2019s assignment of error as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b203-13\">{\u00b6 21} \u201cA. This court should dismiss the state\u2019s appeal because the State of Ohio has not properly appealed the trial court\u2019s decision as the state does not have an appeal as of right.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b203-14\">{\u00b6 22} The state argues that the trial court erred in dismissing the charge of domestic violence based upon its belief that under the facts of this case, R.C. 2919.25 could not constitutionally be applied to Kvasne because he and D.J. were not married. This court agrees.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>{\u00b6 23} In <em>Burk, </em>164 Ohio App.3d 740, 2005-Ohio-6727, 843 N.E.2d 1254, \u00b6 32, and more recently in <em>Douglas, </em>2006-Ohio-2343, 2006 WL 1304860, \u00b6 6, this court has held that Issue I does not render R.C. 2919.25 unconstitutional when applied to unmarried persons of opposite sexes who \u201ccohabit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">{\u00b6 24} In this court\u2019s view, the domestic-violence statute does not \u201ccreate or recognize a legal status for relationships of unmarried individuals\u201d; rather, the <em>legal </em>status remains the same, i.e., one is the witness to a crime and one is the defendant. <em>Burk, </em>164 Ohio App.3d 740, 2005-Ohio-6727, 843 N.E.2d 1254, \u00b6 32; cf., <em>Douglas, </em>2006-Ohio-2343, 2006 WL 1304860, \u00b624. This legal status cannot even remotely be said to be \u201cintended to approximate the design, qualities, significance, or effect of marriage.\u201d <em>Burk, </em>164 Ohio App.3d 740, 2005-Ohio-6727, 843 N.E.2d 1254, \u00b6 25; cf. <em>State v. Logsdon, </em>Seneca App. No. 13-05-29, 2006-Ohio-2938, 2006 WL 1585447. It is not different from the status conferred upon the parties by the other statutes that forbid the same type of conduct\u2014 that of harming another individual.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">{\u00b6 25} The same conduct had been proscribed prior to the enactment of the domestic-violence statute. The Ohio legislature simply has determined with the passage of the domestic-violence statute that the state has a legitimate interest in protecting the \u201cfamily,\u201d which consists of persons who share a life in the same household. This is a constitutional exercise of its authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">{\u00b6 26} Kvasne counters with the assertion that the trial court in this case did not simply dismiss the charge, but, rather, acquitted him of it. The record read in its entirety, however, does not support his assertion.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">{\u00b6 27} In considering Kvasne\u2019s motion for acquittal at the close of the evidence, the trial court stated that \u201c[p]rior to announcing [its] verdict on count two\u201d of the indictment, it wanted the record to reflect that in its view, the state provided evidence in its case-in-chief that only barely met the elements to prove the crime of domestic violence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Nevertheless, acquittal was not the appropriate action; instead, \u201cunder the Court\u2019s reading of the law, [it could]n\u2019t do that\u201d because \u201cas far as the Court [was] concerned,\u201d an acquittal of Kvasne was \u201cthe easy way out.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b204-8\">{\u00b6 28} The court explained its reasoning at some length, indicating that because the evidence demonstrated that Kvasne and the victim were unmarried, \u201cgiven that the voters of the [S]tate of Ohio have chosen\u201d not to \u201crecognize\u201d such a relationship pursuant to the \u201cnew constitutional amendment,\u201d * * * count one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>[was] <em>dismissed, prior to </em>[the] announc[ement of the] verdict.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">{\u00b6 29} At one point during the court\u2019s foregoing discourse, it misspoke, using the words that it was \u201cordering an acquittal.\u201d The court clearly intended, however, to dismiss the charge of domestic violence on the basis of its view that the offense could not be supported under the new constitutional amendment. This is further evidenced by the court\u2019s journal entry, which states that count one was \u201cnolled,\u201d a word that connotes the intent to dismiss rather than to acquit. Since the court speaks only through its journal entry, Kvasne\u2019s counter-argument is rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">{\u00b6 30} Based upon the foregoing, the state\u2019s assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">{\u00b6 31} Kvasne presents the following cross-assignments of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">{\u00b6 32} \u201cI. The state failed to present sufficient evidence to sustain a conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-9\">{\u00b6 33} \u201cII. Appellee\u2019s conviction is against the manifest weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-10\">{\u00b6 34} \u201cIII. The trial court erred by finding appellee guilty of abduction as a lesser-included [sic] of kidnapping.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-11\">{\u00b6 35} \u201cIV. The trial court erred by not enforcing appellee\u2019s subpoena of the police officer as a defense witness after he appeared the previous day with his subpoena.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-12\">{\u00b6 36} &lt;rV. The trial court erred in sentencing appellee to more than the minimum prison sentence when he had not previously served a prison term.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b205-13\">{\u00b6 37} In his first four cross-assignments of error, Kvasne claims that his conviction for abduction should be reversed for four reasons, which will be addressed in logical order.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-14\">{\u00b6 38} Initially, he argues that the trial court violated his right to present a defense when it refused to issue a bench warrant in order to compel the presence at trial of a police officer who received a subpoena from Kvasne to testify.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This argument lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-15\">{\u00b6 39} The record reflects that the officer appeared in response to Kvasne\u2019s subpoena, but his testimony was not required that day; therefore, Kvasne\u2019s trial counsel released him. Moreover, when defense counsel brought the matter to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>trial court\u2019s attention, counsel further admitted that the subpoena had not been personally served on the officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">{\u00b6 40} The trial court correctly noted that personal service of the original subpoena is required in order for the court to issue a bench warrant. <em>State v. Wilcox </em>(June 11, 1992), Cuyahoga App. Nos. 60851 and 60886, 1992 WL 136482. The trial court then continued the matter to the following day for counsel to seek the witness\u2019s attendance.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">{\u00b6 41} Under these circumstances, the trial court neither abused its discretion nor denied Kvasne his right to present a defense. Id. Accordingly, his fourth cross-assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">{\u00b6 42} Kvasne next argues in his first, second, and third cross-assignments of error that his conviction for abduction was improper because it is neither a lesser included offense of kidnapping nor supported by sufficient evidence and the weight of the evidence. These arguments are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-8\">{\u00b6 43} This court recently acknowledged that \u201cthere is a conflict as to whether abduction is a lesser included offense of kidnapping.\u201d <em>State v. Breeden, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 84663, 2005-Ohio-510, 2005 WL 315370, \u00b6 63. Therein, this court cited, inter alia, <em>State v. Morgan, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 81508, 2004-Ohio-6304, 2004 WL 2677456, for the proposition that abduction cannot be considered a lesser included offense,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> whereas <em>State v. Ogletree, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 79882, 2002-Ohio-4070, 2002 WL 1821958, held precisely the opposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-9\">{\u00b6 44} It must first be noted that none of the more recent appellate decisions has recognized that the Ohio Supreme Court previously determined the issue. In <em>State v. Maurer </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 239 at 270-271, 15 OBR 379, 473 N.E.2d 768, the Supreme Court considered the two offenses pursuant to Crim.R. 31(C) and R.C. 2945.74, both of which specifically permit a defendant to be convicted of a lesser included offense. The Supreme Court held that Maurer, who had been indicted for kidnapping, under the circumstances of the case nevertheless \u201cwas not entitled to an instruction on the <em>lesser included offense </em>of abduction.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>{\u00b6 45} The more recent cases from this court that have considered the question of whether abduction is a lesser included offense of the crime of kidnapping not only failed to cite <em>Maurer, </em>but focused instead on \u201cabstract\u201d comparisons of the elements of the offenses. This came about because the test set forth in <em>State v. Rance </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 632, 710 N.E.2d 699, which addressed R.C. 2941.25, became conflated with the test set forth in <em>State v. Deem </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 205, 533 N.E.2d 294. R.C. 2941.25 is concerned with \u201callied offenses\u201d; its intent is to <em>prevent </em>multiple punishments for the same offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">{\u00b6 46} In <em>Deem, </em>the Supreme Court set forth the definitive test for determining whether, in the context of Crim.R. 31(C) and R.C. 2945.74, the same statutes that it considered in <em>Maurer, </em>an offense was a \u201clesser included\u201d offense of another. R.C. 2945.74 seeks to hold a defendant <em>accountable </em>for <em>any </em>criminal conduct he may have committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">{\u00b6 47} As set forth in <em>Deem, </em>an offense \u201cmay be a lesser included offense of another\u201d if the following requirements are met: (1) the offense carries a lesser penalty than the indicted offense; (2) the \u201cgreater\u201d offense cannot, as <em>statutorily defined, </em>ever be committed without having committed the lesser offense, as <em>statutorily defined-, </em>and, (3) some element of the greater offense is not required to prove the commission of the lesser offense. (Emphasis added.) Id., paragraph three of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">{\u00b6 48} Despite the wording emphasized above, it must be noted that <em>Deem </em>specifically adopted the test set forth earlier in <em>State v. Wilkins </em>(1980), 64 Ohio St.2d 382, 18 O.O.3d 528, 415 N.E.2d 303. The language of <em>Wilkins </em>indicates that with respect to a \u201clesser included offense\u201d determination, statutory definitions aside, the analysis <em>must </em>include a consideration of the facts of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">{\u00b6 49} Indeed, the Supreme Court indicated in both <em>Deem </em>and <em>Wilkins </em>that in making a decision as to whether an offense constitutes a lesser included offense of the offense for which the defendant was indicted, a consideration of the evidence presented in the case is crucial. Id. at 388, 18 O.O.3d 528, 415 N.E.2d 303. The aim, according to <em>Deem, </em>was stated as follows: \u201cOur adoption of a test which looks to <em>both </em>the <em>statutory elements </em>of the offenses involved <em>and the evidence supporting </em>- <em>such lesser offenses as presented at trial </em>is grounded primarily in the need for clarity in meeting the constitutional requirement that an accused have <em>notice of the offenses charged </em>against him.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id. at 210, 533 N.E.2d 294.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-9\">{\u00b6 50} The foregoing quote is significant. Although the tests presented in <em>Ranee </em>and <em>Deem </em>seem alike, the aims of the two statutes that the opinions considered are different. Preventing multiple punishments for the same offense clearly is a separate statutory issue from the issue of whether the offense gives <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>notice to the accused and is counted a \u201clesser included\u201d offense of the indicted offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">{\u00b6 51} This court is cognizant that the Ohio Supreme Court has expressed a contrary viewpoint in <em>State v. Barnes </em>(2002), 94 Ohio St.3d 21, 759 N.E.2d 1240. In <em>Barnes, </em>the majority opinion adhered to the position that the evidence presented in a particular case is \u201cirrelevant\u201d to the determination of whether an offense, as \u201cstatutorily defined,\u201d is \u201cnecessarily\u201d included in a greater offense. Id. at 26, 759 N.E.2d 1240. However, in her concurring opinion in <em>Barnes, </em>Justice Lundberg Stratton recognized the problems inherent in the majority opinion\u2019s analysis of lesser included offenses \u2014 i.e., when the analysis focuses <em>strictly </em>on the statutory definitions involved, \u201cconfusion and inconsistency [result].\u201d Id. at 29, 759 N.E.2d 1240.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">{\u00b6 52} Furthermore, a method of analysis that divorces \u201cthe underlying facts of the crimes\u201d in \u201ccompleting\u201d the analysis \u201cbeget[s] illogical results * * *. Decisionmaking in the abstract leaves trial courts to struggle with a test that <em>allows criminal defendants to walk away from their crimes, </em>despite the fact that [the crimes] fit all of the elements of the lesser included offense, unless the state indicts them separately on each potential offense.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id. at 30-31, 759 N.E.2d 1240. In other words, it negates any accountability; the result is <em>opposite </em>the aim of R.C. 2945.74.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">{\u00b6 53} Justice Lundberg Stratton provided a logical solution to the dilemma caused by too strict an application of the second step of the <em>Deem </em>test: return to the basic premise. Rather than \u201ccontinue on the path of examining cases in a vacuum,\u201d an offense should be considered a lesser included offense \u201cdepending on the facts and circumstances of each case.\u201d Id. Thus, \u201cin determining whether one offense is a lesser included offense of the charged offense, the potential relationship of the two offenses must be considered not only in the abstract terms of the defining statutes, but must also be considered in light of the <em>particular facts </em>of each case.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">{\u00b6 54} It is only when the defendant is alleged to have acted by \u201cdeception\u201d that the \u201cstatutorily defined\u201d elements diverge. The elements should not be \u201clumped\u201d together as one in order to notify the defendant of the criminal act of which he is accused. Otherwise, the statutory purpose of R.C. 2945.74 is defeated; the offender is not accountable for committing a \u201clesser included\u201d offense, in spite of the fact that the indictment accuses him of using either force or threat.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">{\u00b6 55} In an effort to distinguish <em>Ranee </em>from <em>Deem, </em>it might be helpful to return to the beginning; to the \u201cNew Ohio Criminal code,\u201d as it was called when enacted by Am.Sub.H.B. No. 511 in 1972. It is clear from the legislative commission\u2019s commentary published in June 1973 that abduction was intended to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>be a lesser included offense of kidnapping, distinguished mainly by the lesser degree of potential harm to the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">{\u00b6 56} The commentary begins, \u201cChapter 2905. combines a number of former kidnapping offenses into one section, although the conduct which may constitute kidnapping is expanded over former law. Lesser offenses of <em>abduction </em>and unlawful restraint are defined, with lawful restraint amounting to false arrest and imprisonment. The chapter retains a child stealing offense, which provides a lesser penalty when the offender is the parent of the child involved.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">{\u00b6 57} \u201cKidnapping and Related Offenses\u201d thus include R.C. 2905.01, which \u201cdefines the <em>most serious </em>offense <em>among the abduction offenses </em>in the code. The offense is divided into two parts, each having a different primary thrust though sharing certain common elements.\u201d The commentary continues, \u201cThe first part of the section includes an abduction or restraint of another for <em>any one </em>of several specified purposes, and it is the <em>offender\u2019s purpose </em>which determines the tenor of this part of the offense.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">{\u00b6 58} The second part of R.C. 2905.01, on the other hand, \u201calso includes an abduction or restraint, and includes holding another in involuntary servitude. <em>In this part </em>of the section, however, the <em>offender\u2019s purpose is irrelevant </em>since the key factor here is the special danger in which the victim is placed.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">{\u00b6 59} Indeed, abduction and kidnapping have been bound together since the early common law. Blackstone defined abduction as the \u201ctaking away of a wife, child or ward, by <em>fraud </em>or open violence,\u201d and kidnapping as the \u201cforcible <em>abduction </em>of a person from his own country to another,\u201d (Emphasis added.) 3 Blackstone Commentaries 139-141. Legal history thus describes kidnapping as the most serious of the abduction offenses. What has been bound together in law for centuries, therefore, should not be rent asunder by a too-literal application of <em>Deem </em>as conflated with <em>Ranee.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b209-9\">{\u00b6 60} As stated in the 1974 Committee Note, R.C. 2905.02 was <em>intended </em>by the legislature to be \u201ca lesser included offense to kidnapping, distinguished mainly by the lesser degree of potential harm to the victim. * * * Unlike kidnapping, however, deception is not listed as one of the means to effect the removal or restraint* * *. Force or threats must be used in every case. Also, the risk of harm to the victim is less than that required in kidnapping * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b209-10\">{\u00b6 61} The language used in <em>Maurer, </em>which was decided only ten years later, therefore, reflected the original legislative intent. Moreover, it is worth noting that since <em>Barnes </em>was decided, it has been cited by the Supreme Court as authority almost exclusively with reference to Crim.R. 52 \u2014 i.e., \u201cplain error\u201d; the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number><em>Barnes </em>majority was reluctant to permit the defendant to escape criminal accountability. Thus, for similar reasons, <em>Barnes </em>is less persuasive than <em>Maurer </em>on the question of the relationship of abduction to kidnapping.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">{\u00b6 62} Even so, R.C. 2905.01 sets forth three separate and distinct kidnapping offenses, to wit: kidnapping by force, kidnapping by threat, <em>or </em>kidnapping by deception; the defendant need utilize only one of the statutorily-defined methods to be guilty of the offense. R.C. 2905.02, Abduction, contains the same elements, <em>but for </em>one \u2014 i.e., the defendant\u2019s use of \u201cdeception.\u201d Thus, if the removal or restraint is done with either force or threat, abduction fits within the \u201cstatutory definition\u201d of kidnapping.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">{\u00b6 63} In the instant case, as <em>indicted, </em>Kvasne was alleged to have committed the offense by threat or force. One of the statutorily defined elements of kidnapping\u2014 i.e., deception, was not named, and, therefore, was <em>not required </em>to prove the offense of abduction. <em>Ogletree, </em>2002-Ohio-4070, 2002 WL 1821958, \u00b6 8; cf., <em>Morgan, </em>2004-Ohio-6304, \u00b6 15. The next step is to examine the evidence presented to determine whether it was sufficient to support Kvasne\u2019s conviction for abduction and whether the trial court\u2019s finding of guilt is supported by the weight of the evidence. <em>Deem, </em>40 Ohio St.3d at 210, 533 N.E.2d 294; <em>State v. Turner </em>(Dec. 12, 1985), Cuyahoga App. No. 49866, 1985 WL 4355.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">{\u00b6 64} D.J. testified that Kvasne pushed her onto the floor, straddled her, and pinned her arms above her head. She stated that her struggles to escape were in vain; she felt \u201cabsolutely helpless\u201d to prevent him from beating her badly, and being aware of Kvasne\u2019s angry disposition, she was afraid for her safety during the incident. She further stated that he refused to permit her to escape until she promised that she would not do anything else to defend herself. Her testimony proved that Kvasne\u2019s use of force and threat during the restraint placed her in fear, thereby violating R.C. 2905.02(A)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">{\u00b6 65} Since defense counsel was unable to impeach her credibility on these points, Kvasne\u2019s guilt of the offense of abduction was supported by both sufficient evidence and the weight of the evidence. <em>State v. Kleybort, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 81350, 2003-Ohio-1162, 2003 WL 1091429, \u00b6 35-36. Kvasne\u2019s first, second, and third cross-assignments of error, therefore, are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-9\">{\u00b6 66} Finally, Kvasne argues that his sentence is unsupported because the trial court failed specifically to find that he \u201cpreviously served a prison term,\u201d as required by R.C. 2929.14(B). This argument also is rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-10\">{\u00b6 67} The record reflects that Kvasne stipulated to his prior conviction in CR196438. His 1985 conviction was for the crime of voluntary manslaughter, a first-degree felony. R.C. 2903.03(B). The docket record for that case demon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>strates that he received a prison sentence of seven to 25 years and served a portion of that term before he was released.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">{\u00b6 68} Moreover, the record in this case reflects that in sentencing Kvasne, the trial court did not rely upon any sentencing statutes that have since been declared unconstitutional in <em>State v. Foster, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 1, 2006-Ohio-856, 845 N.E.2d 470. His sentence, therefore, contravenes neither <em>Blakely v. Washington </em>(2004), 542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403, nor <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey </em>(2000), 530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">{\u00b6 69} Accordingly, Kvasne\u2019s fifth cross-assignment of error also is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">{\u00b6 70} Pursuant to this court\u2019s disposition of the state\u2019s assignment of error in the first case, the dismissal of count one of Kvasne\u2019s indictment is reversed, and this cause is remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">{\u00b6 71} In the second case, Kvasne\u2019s conviction and sentence are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-9\">Judgment affirmed in part and reversed in part, and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b211-10\">Gallagher, P.J., and Kilbane, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b202-12\">.
