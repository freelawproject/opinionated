Brenda Byers, plaintiff below and appellant herein, assigns the following error for review and determination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-4\">The trial court erred in granting appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment and denying appellant\u2019s motion for summary judgment in so far as: (a) appellant\u2019s use of her garage could not be construed, as a matter of law, as being \u201cin whole or in part for business\u201d and thus being covered by a business use exclusion contained in the subject insurance policy; and/or (b) the subject insurance policy was ambiguous regarding the phrase \u201cin whole or in part for business\u201d and should have been construed in favor of appellant, thereby excepting appellant\u2019s use of the garage from the business use exclusion contained in the policy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">{\u00b6 2} Appellant and her flane\u00e9, John Glenn, worked as independent contractors installing satellite antenna television systems. They received work orders at appellant\u2019s house via fax machine and then retrieved satellite dishes at a Chillicothe warehouse. Sometimes they used appellant\u2019s detached garage to assemble the satellite dish antennas and to store them overnight.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">{\u00b6 3} On March 11, 2000, appellant\u2019s garage caught fire, apparently from a wood-burning stove. The fire damaged the structure and various personal-property items. Appellee insured the property under a homeowner\u2019s insurance policy, but denied coverage for the structure. Appellee claimed that appellant used the garage \u201cin whole or in part for business,\u201d a use that was excluded under the policy. The claims supervisor advised appellant: \u201cOur investigation finds the garage was used to store tools and equipment used in the insured\u2019s work/business. The policy specifically excludes coverage for other structures used in whole or in part for business.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">{\u00b6 4} On March 12, 2001, appellant filed a complaint that asserted that she is entitled to coverage under her homeowner\u2019s policy for the damage to her garage. Subsequently, both parties requested summary judgment. Appellee argued that on the date of the fire, appellant used her garage \u201cin whole or in part\u201d for business, which is a use that the policy excludes from coverage. Appellee contended that because appellant\u2019s flane\u00e9 used the garage to assemble satellite dishes and sometimes to store the dishes in the garage on an overnight basis, the coverage exclusion applied. Appellant, however, argued that the phrase \u201c[u]sed in whole or in part for business\u201d is ambiguous. She asserted that the occasional use of the garage to store the satellite dishes on a short-term basis and on occasion to assemble the dishes did not transform her garage into property \u201cused in whole or in part for business.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b438-8\">{\u00b6 5} After consideration, the trial court determined that appellant is not entitled to coverage. The court agreed with appellee that because appellant used <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>the garage to assemble and to store the satellite dishes, she used the garage \u201cin whole or in part\u201d for business. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">{\u00b6 6} In her sole assignment of error, appellant asserts that the trial court erroneously granted appellee summary judgment and denied her summary judgment. She asserts that her use of the garage did not constitute a use \u201cin whole or in part for business,\u201d and that the phrase \u201cused in whole or in part for business\u201d is ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">{\u00b6 7} Initially, we note that appellate courts review trial court summary judgment decisions de novo. <em>Grafton v. Ohio Edison Co. </em>(1996), 77 Ohio St.3d 102, 105, 671 N.E.2d 241. Accordingly, appellate courts independently review the record to determine whether summary judgment is appropriate. Appellate courts need not defer to trial court decisions. See <em>Brown v. Scioto Cty. Bd. of Commrs. </em>(1993), 87 Ohio App.3d 704, 711, 622 N.E.2d 1153; <em>Morehead v. Conley </em>(1991), 75 Ohio App.3d 409, 411-412, 599 N.E.2d 786. Thus, to determine whether a trial court properly granted summary judgment, an appellate court must review the Civ.R. 56 standard for summary judgment as well as the applicable law. Civ.R. 56(C) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-7\">Summary judgment shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, written admissions, affidavits, transcripts of evidence in the pending case, and written stipulations of fact, if any, timely filed in the action, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. No evidence or stipulation may be considered except as stated in this rule. A summary judgment shall not be rendered unless it appears from the evidence or stipulation, and only from the evidence or stipulation, that reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion and that conclusion is adverse to the party against whom the motion for summary judgment is made, that party being entitled to have the evidence or stipulation construed most strongly in the party\u2019s favor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">Thus, a trial court may not grant summary judgment unless the evidence demonstrates that (1) no genuine issue as to any material fact remains to be litigated, (2) the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and (3) it appears from the evidence that reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion, and viewing the evidence most strongly in favor of the nonmoving party, that conclusion is adverse to the party against whom the motion for summary judgment is made. See, e.g., <em>Vahila v. Hall </em>(1997), 77 Ohio St.3d 421, 429-430, 674 N.E.2d 1164.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-9\">{\u00b6 8} The controversy we must resolve in this matter involves an insurance policy. An insurance policy is a contract. <em>Westfield Ins. Co. v. Galatis, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 216, 2003-Ohio-5849, 797 N.E.2d 1256, at \u00b6 9. A court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>interpreting a contract should give effect to the contracting parties\u2019 intent. Id. at \u00b6 11. In doing so, courts must examine the insurance contract as a whole and presume that the language used in the policy reflects the parties\u2019 intent. Id., citing <em>Kelly v. Med. Life Ins. Co. </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 130, 31 OBR 289, 509 N.E.2d 411, paragraph one of the syllabus. \u201cWe look to the plain and ordinary meaning of the language used in the policy unless another meaning is clearly apparent from the contents of the policy.\u201d Id., citing <em>Alexander v. Buckeye Pipe Line Co. </em>(1978), 53 Ohio St.2d 241, 7 O.O.3d 403, 374 N.E.2d 146, paragraph two of the syllabus. \u201c[W]ords and phrases used in an insurance policy must be given their natural and commonly accepted meaning.\u201d <em>Gomolka v. State Auto. Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1982), 70 Ohio St.2d 166, 167-168, 24 O.O.3d 274, 436 N.E.2d 1347. When the words used are clear, courts \u201cmay look no further than the writing itself to find the intent of the parties.\u201d Id. Additionally, the fact that an insurance policy does not define a term does not necessarily mean that the policy is ambiguous. <em>Chicago Title Ins. Co. v. Huntington Natl. Bank </em>(1999), 87 Ohio St.3d 270, 719 N.E.2d 955. However, \u201c[t]he insurer, being the one who selects the language in the contract, must be specific in its use; an exclusion from liability must be clear and exact in order to be given effect.\u201d <em>Lane v. Grange Mut. Cos. </em>(1989), 45 Ohio St.3d 63, 65, 543 N.E.2d 488. See, also, <em>U.S. Fid. &amp; Guar. Co. v. Lightning Rod Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 584, 687 N.E.2d 717; <em>McKeehan v. Am. Family Life Assur. Co. of Columbus, </em>156 Ohio App.3d 254, 805 N.E.2d 183. When an insurer prepares a contract and includes language that is doubtful, vague, or ambiguous, the language must be construed in favor of the insured and strictly against the insurer. <em>Taulbee v. Travelers Cos. </em>(1987), 42 Ohio App.3d 209, 537 N.E.2d 670.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">{\u00b6 9} In the case at bar, we have substantial difficulty with the application of the coverage exclusion clause \u201cin whole or in part for business.\u201d The policy defines \u201cbusiness\u201d as \u201ctrade, profession, or occupation.\u201d \u201cTrade is defined in case law as any business carried on for the purpose of profit or gain or livelihood. The term occupation has been defined as \u2018any business, trade, profession, pursuit, vocation, or calling\u2019 or as \u2018that which occupies, or engages, the time and attention.\u2019 Profession is defined as \u2018a vocation requiring extensive education in science or the liberal arts and often specialized training.\u2019 \u201d (Footnotes omitted.) Windt, Insurance Claims and Disputes (3d Ed.1995) 286-287, Section 11.15. Here, appellant\u2019s \u201cbusiness\u201d was installing satellite antenna systems. Occasionally, appellant and her fianc\u00e9 used the garage to assemble and to store the satellite dishes. At first glance, it appears that appellant\u2019s use of her garage falls within the \u201cin whole or in part for business\u201d exclusion. We believe, however, that the precise scope and application of the contract\u2019s coverage exclusion \u201cin whole or in part for business\u201d have been inadequately and insufficiently defined. Insurance contracts that contain uncertainties or doubtful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>meanings must be construed in favor of the insured and strictly against the insurer. <em>Clark v. Scarpelli </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 271, 744 N.E.2d 719. Taken to its logical extreme, appellee\u2019s interpretation of the phrase \u201cin whole or in part for business\u201d could exclude coverage for the plumber, electrician, or carpenter who parks his tool truck in his garage because he uses the garage \u201cin whole or in part for business.\u201d This exclusion draws no discernable line and sets no parameters to distinguish between active, ongoing business pursuits and passive activities remotely related to income or employment pursuits. Furthermore, under appellee\u2019s interpretation of the exclusion, physicians, attorneys, engineers, teachers, or architects who, on occasion, conduct telephone conversations from their home or garage with a patient, client, student, or employer, or who place work-related material in their vehicle could, in theory, be excluded from coverage because they used their home or garage for \u201cbusiness purposes in whole or in part.\u201d Another example is a homeowner\u2019s teenage son or daughter who uses the family lawnmower, which is stored in the garage, to mow neighborhood lawns for profit. Under appellee\u2019s interpretation, the exclusion would apply in the foregoing examples. We believe, however, that the exclusionary clause\u2019s language lacks precision and is too vague for us to attempt to ascertain its proper scope and application. The language in the exclusionary clause presents far too many uncertainties to either ignore or attempt to fashion a more definitive and limited application. Here, the exclusion arguably applies to deny coverage for an insured\u2019s use of property that in any way remotely touches any \u201cbusiness\u201d or income-earning effort.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">{\u00b6 10} We also note that in the case sub judice, appellant did not actually perform the work that earned her money (i.e., install satellite antennas) in her garage. Instead, she used the garage as a matter of convenience. See, generally, Windt, Insurance Claims and Disputes (3d Ed.1995) 286-287, Section 11.15 (\u201cThe general rule is that to constitute a business pursuit for the purpose of an exclusion in a liability policy, there must be continuity and a profit motive. The business need not be the insured\u2019s principal occupation. * * * The insured\u2019s involvement with the activity, however, should be more than minimal (footnotes omitted)\u201d); see, also, <em>Lenart v. Craig </em>(May 12, 1994), Cuyahoga App. Nos. 65372 and 65373, 1994 WL 189433 (\u201c[I]n order for an activity to constitute a \u2018business pursuit,\u2019 two elements must be satisfied[:] (1) continuity; and (2) profit motive.\u201d) Here, appellant did not continuously use the garage to store and assemble the satellite systems.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">{\u00b6 11} Our research located one Ohio case that touched upon this issue, but the court\u2019s reasoning is not apparent. In <em>Singler v. Gen. Acceptance Group </em>(Sept. 22, 1978), Erie App. No. E-78-28, 1978 WL 214865, the plaintiffs had a home and a separate three-stall garage. A tenant of the home used one of the three stalls <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>to store several coin-operated amusement and vending machines that he used in conducting a business operation at county fairs. After a fire damaged the garage, the insurer denied the claim and asserted that the policy excluded coverage for structures used for \u201cbusiness purposes.\u201d The trial court entered judgment in the plaintiffs\u2019 favor. On appeal, the insurer argued that the tenant\u2019s use of the garage for storing vending machines constituted a use \u201cin whole or in part for business purposes,\u201d which the policy excluded. The trial court determined that renting one portion of the residence to a tenant was not doing business and that the tenant\u2019s use of the garage to store property was not doing business under the policy definition. The policy defined \u201cbusiness\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-5\">(1) a trade, profession or occupation, including farming, and the use of any premises or portion of residence premises for any such purposes; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-6\">(2) the rental or holding for rental of the whole or any portion of the premises by any insured: but business shall not include:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-7\">(a) the occasional rental or holding for rental of the residence premises for dwelling purposes;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-8\">(b) the rental or holding for rental of a portion of the residence premises for dwelling purposes unless for the accommodation of three or more roomers or boarders;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-9\">(c) the rental or holding for rental of a portion of the residence premises for private garage purposes; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-10\">(d) the rental or holding for rental of a portion of the residence premises as an office, school or studio.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-11\">The appellate court concluded that \u201cthere is substantial probative evidence to support the findings of fact and conclusions of law of the trial court.\u201d One explanation for the court\u2019s conclusion is that the alleged \u201cbusiness\u201d use was so minimal that one could not reasonably state that the property was used \u201cfor business.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b442-12\">{\u00b6 12} We recognize that several Ohio cases that construe the word \u201cbusiness\u201d in a homeowner\u2019s insurance policy do not find the term to be ambiguous. None of the cases, however, involved the exact phrase at issue in the case at bar. For example, in <em>Watkins v. Brown </em>(1994), 97 Ohio App.3d 160, 646 N.E.2d 485, the court concluded that a business-exclusion provision in a homeowner\u2019s policy excluded coverage to the insured who babysat for a friend\u2019s child in her home. In <em>Watkins, </em>Brown received $40 per week to babysit on weekdays. One day, Brown broke the child\u2019s leg while changing her diaper, and the Watkinses sued Brown. Brown\u2019s homeowner\u2019s insurance carrier, Cincinnati Insurance Company, asserted that Brown\u2019s homeowner\u2019s policy did not cover the child\u2019s injuries because the policy excluded from liability coverage damages \u201carising out of any activities of any insured in connection with a business owned or controlled by any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>insured.\u201d The appellate court stated that the provision \u201cunambiguously excludes from coverage any liability arising from activities [the insured] engaged in that were connected with [the insured\u2019s] own business\u201d and that the insured\u2019s babysitting activity constituted a \u201cbusiness.\u201d 97 Ohio App.3d at 164, 646 N.E.2d 485. The court noted that the policy defined \u201cbusiness\u201d to include \u201cany trade, profession, or occupation of any kind * * *. Newspaper delivery, baby-sitting, caddying, lawn care, and similar incidental business activities by a minor resident of your household are not considered business,\u201d and concluded that \u201c[a]pplying the principles of strict construction, we conclude that Brown\u2019s baby-sitting services must at least qualify as a \u2018trade, profession, or occupation of any kind\u2019 in order to qualify as a \u2018business.\u2019 \u201d 97 Ohio App.3d at 165, 646 N.E.2d 485. \u201cWe take \u2018trade, profession, or occupation of any kind\u2019 to signify that baby-sitting may be a kind of trade or occupation for which the policy was not meant to provide liability coverage.\u201d 97 Ohio App.3d at 165, 646 N.E.2d 485. The court looked to the ordinary meaning of \u201ctrade,\u201d which is defined as \u201c \u2018the business one practices or the work in which one engages regularly; one\u2019s calling; gainful employment; means of livelihood.\u2019 \u201d The court concluded that Brown\u2019s babysitting constituted a trade:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-4\">Brown and the Watkinses negotiated a fee for Brown\u2019s baby-sitting services to compensate her for her time and trouble. This amount, $40, was paid in cash each Friday, and was not used to purchase food or diapers or any other supplies for Danielle. The fact that Brown did not realize an enormous profit from this arrangement is not dispositive, nor is the fact that she probably would not have agreed to baby-sit if someone other than her good friend had asked her to do it. The definition of \u201ctrade\u201d does not require that the tradesperson be motivated entirely by profit, and the $40 she realized each week was pure profit-gain produced by her labor. Moreover, her labor was regular-each weekday from 9:00 to 4:00 or from 12:00 to 4:00-though it lasted only about six months. * * * Brown\u2019s baby-sitting * * * was work she engaged in regularly, and which produced an income for her. It was therefore a business as contemplated in the homeowner\u2019s policy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">(Citation omitted.) 97 Ohio App.3d at 165-166, 646 N.E.2d 485. We have no quarrel with the <em>Watkins </em>holding for several reasons. First, the <em>Watkins </em>court was not called to decide a matter that involved coverage and loss to the homeowner\u2019s residence unrelated to the actual business use (i.e., in <em>Watkins, </em>the homeowner charged a fee for babysitting and actually sought coverage for risks related to the business, rather than damage or loss sustained for reasons completely unrelated to the business activity such as a house fire caused by faulty wiring). Second, we do not believe that the language the <em>Watkins </em>court construed is sufficiently similar to the language in appellee\u2019s policy. In fact, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>language in <em>Watkins </em>is more specific than the language appellee employed in the case sub judice.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">{\u00b6 13} We also find that the cases appellee cites are inapposite. In <em>United Ohio Ins. Co. v. Metzger </em>(Feb. 8, 1999), Putnam App. No. 12-98-1, 1999 WL 84201, the parties agreed that the loss arose out of or was in connection with the insured\u2019s business. The question on appeal was whether the insured\u2019s wife should be denied coverage. In the case at bar, the parties do not agree that the loss arose out of or was in connection with appellant\u2019s business. In <em>Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. Eckmeyer </em>(2001), 145 Ohio App.3d 753, 764 N.E.2d 487, the court determined that a provision that excluded coverage for \u201cBodily injury or property damage arising out of the ownership, maintenance or use of a vehicle when used: * * * b. For retail or wholesale delivery, including pizza, magazine, newspaper and mail delivery,\u201d was not ambiguous. The court stated that \u201cthe term \u2018delivery\u2019 should be construed to include all work-related activity engaged in by an insured whose primary work-related responsibility is as a delivery driver in the course of his or her working day.\u201d 145 Ohio App.3d at 757, 764 N.E.2d 487. The case sub judice, however, involves different terminology and different facts. In <em>Shuback v. State Auto. Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(Dec. 6, 1999), Mahoning App. No. 97-CA-176, 1999 WL 1138563, the court looked to the following \u201cbusiness use exclusion\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-5\">A. We do not provide Liability Coverage for any person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-6\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-7\">6. While employed or otherwise engaged in the \u201cbusiness\u201d of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-8\">a. selling;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-9\">b. repairing;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-10\">c. servicing;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-11\">d. storing; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-12\">e. parking;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-13\">vehicles designed for use mainly on public highways. This includes road testing and delivery.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-15\">The court determined that the insured\u2019s conduct constituted being employed or otherwise engaged in the business of selling or delivering cars. The court did not examine the precise language of the terms, but instead focused on the argument that the insured\u2019s conduct fell within the exclusion. In the case at bar, by contrast, we believe that appellee\u2019s exclusion language is vague and is not sufficiently defined. Thus, we are unable to determine whether appellant\u2019s conduct falls within the exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-16\">{\u00b6 14} In summary, we agree with appellant that the phrase \u201cused in whole or in part for business\u201d is vague and lacks precision. See, also, <em>Roland v. Nation</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number><em>wide Mut. Fire Ins. Co. </em>(2001), 286 A.D.2d 872, 730 N.Y.S.2d 599 (concluding that insurer could not deny coverage for \u201cother structure\u201d used to store business items because \u201c[t]he phrase \u2018used in whole or in part for business purposes\u2019 is ambiguous in the absence of any qualifying language\u201d). Here, the language makes no effort to distinguish between an ongoing business concern conducted in a home or garage and passive or incidental activities remotely related to a person\u2019s employment or income. Consequently, we must construe the provision in appellant\u2019s favor, find that the exclusion does not apply, and conclude that the exclusion does not preclude coverage. See <em>Galatis, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 216, 2003-Ohio-5849, 797 N.E.2d 1256.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">{\u00b6 15} We, however, certainly recognize and acknowledge valid concerns by insurers in these situations. Insureds should not be permitted to unilaterally expand their bargained-for homeowner\u2019s insurance coverage by simply choosing to operate a commercial enterprise and expect expanded coverage springing from their homeowner\u2019s insurance policy. A commercial enterprise exposes insureds and insurers to increased risks. Therefore, insureds should obtain appropriate coverage and pay the corresponding premium to reflect the increased risk and increased coverage associated with business concerns. However, contract language must clearly define and delineate excluded activities. Contract language that could be construed to constitute an absolute prohibition on any activity even remotely involved with a business or income enterprise cannot be enforced unless that prohibition is clearly and explicitly set forth. Many people engage in activities that arguably involve passive \u201cbusiness\u201d activities within their private residences. An insured who stores a briefcase or records in her garage or home should not, in our view, be deemed to have been engaged in a business activity and fall under the coverage exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\"> {\u00b6 16} Second, even if we accepted appellee\u2019s argument that the contract\u2019s exclusionary language is clear and unambiguous and did exclude the structure from coverage if it was used \u201cin whole or in part for business,\u201d we believe that the business activity in the case sub judice was so minimal that it did not invoke the exclusion\u2019s application. Here, the alleged business activity apparently did not cause the loss or damage. Activities related to a business that may result in a de minimis increase in risk and did not cause the loss or damage should not preclude coverage under an insurance contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">{\u00b6 17} Accordingly, based upon the foregoing reasons, we hereby sustain appellant\u2019s sole assignment of error, reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment, and remand the matter for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-8\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b446-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>Kline, J., concurs in judgment only.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b446-4\">Harsha, P.J., dissents.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b446-5\">Harsha, Presiding Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A2j\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">{\u00b6 18} It is clear that the appellant used the garage \u201cin whole or in part for business\u201d by storing satellite parts in it and by occasionally using the space to assemble the dishes.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">{\u00b6 19} Consider the example of a plumber, electrician, or carpenter who has a work vehicle parked in the garage. Storing a work vehicle in a garage or storing items for work in your own car doesn\u2019t constitute \u201cusing\u201d the garage for business. Most people use their vehicles to get to and from work and have various work-related items in their vehicles. But that does not mean that merely storing that vehicle \u2014 even if it is a company owned vehicle \u2014 is \u201cusing\u201d that garage for business purposes. However, if you store business inventory in the garage you are \u201cusing\u201d the garage for work purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">{\u00b6 20} Another scenario that may arise involves the teenage son or daughter who uses the family lawnmower to mow lawns for profit. The policy defines \u201cbusiness\u201d to include \u201ctrade, profession, or occupation,\u201d and I do not believe that occasional lawn mowing by a teenager meets any of the dictionary definitions of trade, profession, or occupation, although someone who ran a landscaping business would meet that definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-9\">{\u00b6 21} Likewise, if you are a doctor or lawyer talking to a patient or client on your cell phone in the garage, you are not using the garage for work purposes. You may be standing in the garage but you are not \u201cusing\u201d it any more than you are using the grocery store for work purposes if you happen to be talking to a patient or client when standing in line to pay for your groceries. You happen to be there, but your presence does not involve the structure in your business. \u201cPresence\u201d and \u201cuse\u201d are not synonymous.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-10\">{\u00b6 22} Finally, the contract here is not vague. This exclusion from coverage applies only to \u201cother structures,\u201d not to the actual dwelling where the insured resides. So, an insured would not void coverage to the residence itself by working from home, either occasionally or on a regular basis. While there may indeed be some \u201cclose calls\u201d as to whether the business exclusion applies, this is not one of them. Appellant clearly used the garage for business purposes in at least two ways \u2014 to store items associated with her business and to assemble items for her business. I disagree with the majority\u2019s contention that appellant used the garage as a mere \u201cconvenience.\u201d She clearly needed to assemble and store the dishes somewhere and used her garage for this purpose. Rather than reversing the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, we should affirm it on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>narrow facts of this case, while recognizing that perhaps there are other \u201cclose\u201d situations that may result in a different result.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
