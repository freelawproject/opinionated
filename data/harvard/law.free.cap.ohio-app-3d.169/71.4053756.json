For the reasons set forth herein, we reverse the judgment and remand the cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">{\u00b6 2} This taxpayer suit was previously before this court in W. <em>Unity ex rel. Beltz v. Merillat, </em>6th Dist. No. WM-03-016, 2004-Ohio-2682, 2004 WL 1171179 (\u201cW. <em>Unity I </em>\u201d). This matter originally arose as a result of appellant\u2019s challenge to a public-improvement cost estimate under Ohio\u2019s Prevailing Wage Law, R.C. 4115.03 to 4115.16. The subject of the prior appeal was the trial court\u2019s denial of appellant\u2019s application for an injunction and for a writ of mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">{\u00b6 3} In our previous decision, the issue before this court was whether a \u201cfair estimate\u201d of the total overall cost of the construction of a public improvement must automatically include the cost of labor based on the prevailing wage in the locality at the time the project is let out for bidding. We concluded that it must. W. <em>Unity I </em>at \u00b6 30. Therefore, we reversed the judgment of the trial court. Because the construction was already completed, we could not afford appellant his requested injunctive relief or a writ of mandamus. Id. at \u00b6 36. However, we noted that we could award appellant his demand for court costs and attorney fees. Id. Therefore, we remanded the cause \u201cfor a determination of appellant\u2019s costs, including his attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">{\u00b6 4} Upon remand, on February 23, 2005, appellant filed a memorandum and affidavit in support of attorney fees and costs of appellant\u2019s attorney, Joseph M. D\u2019Angelo, seeking $105,032.50. On March 4, 2005, appellees filed a memorandum in response seeking a significant \u201cdiscount\u201d of the so-called lodestar amount as well as costs. On April 12, 2005, appellant filed a reply memorandum.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-9\">{\u00b6 5} After a motion filed by appellees, the trial court held a hearing on the matter on June 16, 2005. On July 13, 2005, appellant filed a surreply brief on fees and costs, adding $13,262 in attorney fees, bringing the total request to $118,294.50. On October 19, 2005, the trial court entered a judgment entry awarding appellant\u2019s attorney a discounted amount of $12,000 in attorney fees. It is from this judgment that appellant appeals, asserting the following assignments of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b105-10\">{\u00b6 6} \u201cI. The Trial Court committed reversible error in refusing to award any fees for time expended by law clerks.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-11\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cII. The Trial Court erred in finding the reasonable hourly Rate for Attorney D\u2019Angelo to be $100 per hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>{\u00b6 8} \u201cHI. The Trial Court erred by reducing the lump sum of Attorney D\u2019Angelo\u2019s hours by two-third based solely on the hours Appellee\u2019s counsel expended.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cIV. The Trial Court abused its discretion in disregarding Appellant\u2019s Supplemental Fee Request.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">{\u00b6 10} R.C. 4115.16(D) provides that upon a court\u2019s finding that a violation of the prevailing-wage law has occurred, the court shall award attorney fees and court costs to the prevailing party. Further, with regard to taxpayer suits against a municipal corporation, R.C. 733.61 provides: \u201cIf the court hearing a case under section 733.59 of the Revised Code is satisfied that the taxpayer had good cause to believe that his allegations were well founded, or if they are sufficient in law, it shall make such order as the equity of the case demands. In such case the taxpayer shall be allowed his costs, and, if judgment is finally ordered in his favor, he may be allowed, as part of the costs, a reasonable compensation for his attorney.\u201d We recognized this authority in the original appeal by remanding the cause \u201cfor a determination of appellant\u2019s costs, including his attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d <em>W. Unity I </em>at \u00b6 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">{\u00b6 11} \u201c[Wjhere a court is empowered to award attorney fees by statute, the amount of such fees is within the sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d <em>Brooks v. Hurst Buick-Pontiac-Olds-GMC, Inc. </em>(1985), 23 Ohio App.3d 85, 91, 23 OBR 150, 491 N.E.2d 345. See, also, <em>Bittner v. Tri-County Toyota, Inc. </em>(1991), 58 Ohio St.3d 143, 146, 569 N.E.2d 464. An abuse of discretion connotes more than an error of law or judgment. It implies that the court\u2019s attitude is unreasonable, unconscionable, or arbitrary. <em>Blakemore v. Blakemore </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St:3d 217, 219, 5 OBR 481, 450 N.E.2d 1140.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">{\u00b6 12} Relative to the calculation of attorney fees, we have held:</p>\n<p id=\"b106-9\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cGenerally, when awarding reasonable attorney fees, the trial court should calculate the number of hours reasonably expended and multiply that number by the hourly fee. See <em>[Bittner] </em>at syllabus. Thereafter, the trial court \u2018may modify that calculation by application of the factors listed in DR 2-106(B).\u2019 Id. DR 2-106(B) states:</p>\n<p id=\"b106-10\">{\u00b6 14} \u201c \u2018Factors to be considered as guides in determining the reasonableness of a fee include the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b106-11\">{\u00b6 15} \u201c \u2018(1) The time and labor required, the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, and the skill requisite to perform the legal service properly.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-12\">{\u00b6 16} \u201c \u2018(2) The likelihood, if apparent to the client, that the acceptance of the particular employment will preclude other employment by the lawyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>{\u00b6 17} \u201c \u2018(3) The fee customarily charged in the locality for similar legal services.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\">{\u00b6 18} \u201c \u2018(4) The amount involved and the results obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">{\u00b6 19} \u201c \u2018(5) The time limitations imposed by the client or by the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">{\u00b6 20} \u201c \u2018(6) The nature and length of the professional relationship with the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">{\u00b6 21} \u201c \u2018(7) The experience, reputation, and ability of the lawyer or lawyers performing the services.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-8\">{\u00b6 22} \u201c \u2018(8) Whether the fee is fixed or contingent.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b107-9\">{\u00b6 23} <em>\u201cBittner </em>recognized, however, that all of these factors \u2018may not be applicable in all cases\u2019 and that \u2018the trial court has the discretion to determine which factors to apply, and in what manner that application will affect the initial calculation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hess v. Toledo </em>(2000), 139 Ohio App.3d 581, 586-587, 744 N.E.2d 1236, quoting <em>Bittner </em>at 146, 569 N.E.2d 464.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-10\">{\u00b6 24} All of appellant\u2019s assignments of error essentially challenge the reasonableness of the trial court\u2019s award of attorney fees and costs, which was clearly heavily discounted from the amount requested. Initially, we find it necessary to discern the trial court\u2019s review process as demonstrated by the record. Although the matter was scheduled for a June 16, 2005 hearing, the only transcript in the record is the partial transcript testimony of relator Jeff Beltz. This testimony relates to the scope of the apparently oral agreement for attorney D\u2019Angelo\u2019s services. Without a transcript of the hearing, this court is left with the rather minimal analysis by the trial court in its October 19, 2005 judgment entry, and this serves as the basis for our review. We also note that a trial court\u2019s failure to articulate its reasons for varying from an adequately documented lodestar amount can render an award virtually unreviewable. See <em>Simmons v. BVM, Inc. </em>(Aug. 31, 1995), 8th Dist. No. 68502, 1995 WL 517032.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-11\">{\u00b6 25} In his first assignment of error, appellant argues that the trial court abused its discretion when it essentially treated the law-clerk and paraprofessional fees requested as overhead expense with no award. We agree with appellant that it is clear from the trial court\u2019s calculation of the $12,000 award (120 discounted hours by attorney D\u2019Angelo multiplied by the $100 discounted hourly rate) that the trial court did not award anything for law-clerk and paraprofessional fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-12\">{\u00b6 26} In support of his contentions that the trial court erred in failing to award any law-clerk or paraprofessional fees, appellant cites several cases. Appellees respond that none of these cases involves the specific attorney-fees statute at issue in the present case, R.C. 733.61. In <em>Scheiderer &amp; Assoc. v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number><em>London </em>(Aug. 5, 1996), 12th Dist. No. CA95-08-022, 1996 WL 435312, the court examined the reasonableness of awarding certain litigation expenses, including paralegal fees, as an award of attorney fees under R.C. 2323.51 as a sanction for appellant\u2019s frivolous conduct. The court found that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in awarding these fees, noting that when properly employed, these paraprofessionals \u201cmay decrease litigation expenses, and their use should not be discouraged.\u201d Id. Pursuant to <em>Non-Employees of Chateau Estates Resident Assn. v. Chateau Estates, Ltd., </em>2nd Dist. No. 2004 CA 19, 2004-Ohio-3781, 2004 WL 1587234, at \u00b6 33, and <em>Jackson v. Brown </em>(1992), 83 Ohio App.3d 230, 614 N.E.2d 847, attorney fees under R.C. 5321.15 landlord/tenant law includes the work of law clerks and legal interns. Finally, in <em>Specht v. Finnegan, </em>149 Ohio App.3d 201, 2002-Ohio-4660, 776 N.E.2d 564, in the context of a public-records and open-meeting case, we have stated that paralegal fees are compensable as an element of attorney fees. Id. at \u00b6 44, citing <em>Jackson </em>at 232, 614 N.E.2d 847.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">(\u00b6 27} Although <em>Scheiderer, Chateau Estates, </em>and <em>Specht </em>involved attorney fees under statutes other than R.C. 733.61 for taxpayer suits, the principles have application in the present case. None of these statutes specifically mention paraprofessional or law-clerk fees, but rather use the term \u201cattorney fees\u201d and \u201ccosts.\u201d Pursuant to <em>Scheiderer, Chateau Estates, </em>and <em>Specht, </em>it is not an abuse of discretion <em>to award them </em>in appropriate cases. We cannot say that it is necessarily an abuse of discretion to refuse to award them. However, we remand this matter for a further consideration and discussion by the trial court regarding the reasons for either failing to award these fees or, alternatively, for awarding these fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">{\u00b6 28} In his second assignment of error, appellant argues that the trial court abused its discretion in finding the reasonable hourly rate for attorney D\u2019Angelo, a Toledo-based attorney with specialized experience in the area of prevailing-wage law, was $100, the allegedly common rate in Williams County. Appellant cites the 2004 Desktop Reference on the Economics of Law Practice in Ohio. Appellant also cites the favorable results he obtained for his client on what we termed in the original appeal, \u201ca question of public or great general interest.\u201d <em>W. Unity I </em>at \u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">{\u00b6 29} In the present case, the trial court stated that it applied the criteria for fees and legal services contained in DR 2-106. However, the trial court did not state specifically which criteria.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">{\u00b6 30} In the past, this court has not been persuaded that the purpose of DR 2 \u2014 106(B)(3) is to compel attorneys who accept cases from various parts of a state (or from more than one state) to vary their hourly fees based upon the prevailing fees charged by other attorneys who do not conduct a statewide practice but who limit their practice to a smaller geographical area. See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number><em>Hamilton Mut. Ins. Co. v. Perry (1997), </em>124 Ohio App.3d 147, 152, 705 N.E.2d 731. We agree with appellant that the evidence presented in this case shows that the locality to be considered in relation to DR 2 \u2014 106(B)(3) is not so narrow as Williams County, Ohio. Appellant\u2019s attorney presented evidence showing that he has conducted an 11-year litigation and labor-law practice from a law office located in Toledo, Ohio. The evidence presented to the trial court showed that the fee of $200 an hour was commensurate with the fees charged by other attorneys based in Toledo who have expertise on par with the expertise of appellant\u2019s attorney. Accordingly, this court finds that the trial court abused its discretion when it ruled that a fee of $100 an hour was customarily charged in the locality for similar legal services.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">{\u00b6 31} In his third assignment of error, appellant contends that the trial court abused its discretion when it arbitrarily cut attorney D\u2019Angelo\u2019s hours by two-thirds based solely on the hours appellees\u2019 counsel expended on his ill-conceived arguments that ultimately failed. Appellant\u2019s third assignment of error implicates DR 2 \u2014 106(B)(1) and (4): the time and labor required, the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, the skill requisite to perform the legal service properly, and the results obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">{\u00b6 32} In the present case, the trial court concluded that the time claimed was \u201coverstated by a factor of 3.\u201d The only apparent observation that led to this conclusion was stated by the trial court as follows: \u201c[AJlthough it is not a direct measure of the time required by Mr. D\u2019Angelo to perform these services, the Court notes that opposing counsel in the aggregate billed just over 81 hours to defend the same case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">{\u00b6 33} <em>Chateau Estates </em>involved five issues, including a complex water-safety issue, which required a large amount of time and effort, and on which the plaintiffs were ultimately successful. Thus, the court concluded that the trial court \u201cvastly underestimated\u201d the attorneys\u2019 time. Id. at \u00b6 39. The appellate court ended up performing the attorney-fees calculation itself because of the trial court\u2019s \u201cobstinanee\u201d in ignoring the appellate court\u2019s guidance on this issue in a prior appeal. Id. at \u00b6 37, 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-8\">{\u00b6 34} In <em>Specht, </em>we found no abuse of discretion when the trial court discounted attorney fees for an admittedly inexperienced attorney because the trial court \u201cexamined the fees at length against the factors enumerated in DR 2-106.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 48. In contrast to <em>Specht, </em>in the present case, we have no evidence of thoughtful consideration by the trial court. Further, in contrast to <em>Specht, </em>there is no evidence that appellant\u2019s attorney was inexperienced and, therefore, possibly inefficient, and appellant was successful on all the substantive prevailing-wage-law issues raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>{\u00b6 35} Similar to the court\u2019s finding in <em>Chateau Estates, </em>we believe that the trial court underestimated attorney D\u2019Angelo\u2019s time. However, we decline to perform the attorney-fees calculation ourselves and remand the cause for a further, thoughtful, Specht-like consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">{\u00b6 36} In his final assignment of error, appellant asserts that the trial court abused its discretion in disregarding appellant\u2019s supplemental fee request, which was necessitated by appellees\u2019 ongoing opposition to appellant\u2019s attorney fees. As with the law-clerk and paraprofessional fees, it is clear from the trial court\u2019s simple calculation of the $12,000 award that the trial court disregarded appellant\u2019s supplemental fee request for the additional time that D\u2019Angelo and his staff spent on the attorney-fees issues continuing to be raised by appellees after appellant\u2019s filing of the initial request.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">{\u00b6 37} In support, appellant cites <em>Turner v. Progressive Corp. </em>(2000), 140 Ohio App.3d 112, 746 N.E.2d 702. In <em>Turner, </em>the Eighth District Court of Appeals held that the trial court abused its discretion in concluding that the time the attorney spent preparing the attorney-fee argument was not properly part of the lodestar. Id. at 117-118, 746 N.E.2d 702. The court found that to consistently fail to compensate an attorney for this time \u201c \u2018would not comport with the purpose behind most statutory fee authorizations, viz, the encouragement of attorneys to represent indigent clients and to act as private attorneys general in vindicating congressional policies.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 118, 746 N.E.2d 702, quoting <em>Gagne v. Maher </em>(C.A.2, 1979), 594 F.2d 336, 344. The court remanded the case, in part, for the trial court to \u201caddress an award for the time expended on the attorney fee application.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">{\u00b6 38} Appellees contend that <em>Turner </em>has no application in the present case because the state prevailing-wage law at issue does not implicate congressional policies like the Fair Labor Act did in <em>Turner. </em>We find, however, that the principle articulated in <em>Turner </em>still has application to state policies, such as the prevailing-wage law. That is, to fail to compensate an attorney for the time spent preparing the attorney-fee argument, without any explanation by the trial court, would not comport with the purpose behind most statutory fee authorizations, namely, the encouragement of attorneys to represent indigent clients and to act as private attorneys general in vindicating state policies. We remand for the trial court to address, at a minimum, an award for the time expended on the attorney-fee application under appellant\u2019s supplemental fee request.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">{\u00b6 39} Therefore, to the extent herein described, appellant\u2019s assignments of error are found well taken. The Williams County Court of Common Pleas award of $12,000 for attorney fees is reversed, and the issue of fees is remanded to the trial court for a redetermination of a reasonable fee and findings that rationally articulate why appellant is not entitled to the claimed lodestar award. Appellees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>are ordered to pay the costs of this appeal pursuant to App.R. 24. Judgment for the clerk\u2019s expense incurred in preparation of the record, fees allowed by law, and the fee for filing the appeal is awarded to Williams County.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b111-5\">Skow, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b111-6\">Handwork, J., concurs in part and dissents in part.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b111-7\">Handwork, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Ah\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">{\u00b6 40} I concur in all respects with the decision of the majority, with one exception. The majority remands the cause to the trial court for the purposes of further consideration and discussion of the issue of whether paraprofessional (paralegal) or law-clerk fees may be awarded as part of the attorney-fee award, suggesting that \u201c[w]e cannot say that it is necessarily an abuse of discretion to refuse to award them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b111-9\">{\u00b6 41} In light of <em>Scheiderer, Chateau Estates, </em>and <em>Specht, </em>and because of the fact that we clearly consider this case an appropriate case for the award of attorney fees, I would find that the failure to award paraprofessional (paralegal) fees and law-clerk fees was an abuse of discretion and would remand only for the trial court to include the hours submitted for these fees as part of the award of attorney fees.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
