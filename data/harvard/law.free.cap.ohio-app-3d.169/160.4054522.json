She contends that the trial court erred in concluding that because she was in default for\\answer, the trial court was not obliged to consider testimony-concerning the best interest of the children of the parties and could properly exclude her from participating in the proceedings. We agree. Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court is reversed, and this cause is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b193-9\">{\u00b6 2} Plaintiff-appellee, Dan W. Rue Jr., filed a complaint for divorce on July 19, 2005. In the complaint, Mr. Rue alleged that the parties were married in Xenia on April 18, 2002, and that there are two children of the marriage: Tiffany N. Rue, born October 15, 1991, and Bradley E. Rue, born July 11, 1997. The complaint alleged incompatibility, extreme cruelty, and gross neglect of duty and asked for a divorce, custody of both children, child support, attorney\u2019s fees, and spousal support.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-11\">{\u00b6 3} The record reflects that the complaint was served upon Mrs. Rue on July 20, 2005, by personal service. Mrs. Rue did not file an answer or other responsive pleading. A pretrial hearing was held on December 1, 2005. Mr. Rue and his trial counsel were present. Mrs. Rue was present, but was not represented. The following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<p id=\"b193-13\">{\u00b6 4} \u201cTHE COURT: Okay. Mrs. Rue, you haven\u2019t filed any answer, you haven\u2019t entered an appearance, you haven\u2019t done anything to contest the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-14\">{\u00b6 5} \u201cMRS. RUE: I have, they have sent everything I file [sic] back to me.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-15\">{\u00b6 6} \u201cTHE COURT: You haven\u2019t filed anything, ma\u2019am. If it is not filed with the Clerk of Courts, it is not my responsibility nor the Clerk of Courts responsibility to do your paperwork properly. That is your responsibility. Until it\u2019s done properly, it is not filed, so we\u2019re going to schedule this for an uncontested hearing and Mr. Sheets and his client will come in and conduct a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>{\u00b6 7} \u201cNow, if you get an attorney or you properly file a motion for request to answer late \u2014 you\u2019re out of time to answer now.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cMRS. RUE: Mmm-hmm.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cTHE COURT: I\u2019ll grant that, but you can\u2019t do it by yourself. If you want to contest this case, you can\u2019t do it by yourself. It\u2019s as simple as that. Legally you may be able to, but you can\u2019t do it by yourself. Okay. You\u2019ve had since July and it is not filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cMRS. RUE: I know.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cTHE COURT: Mr. Sheets [representing Mr. Rue], I\u2019ll have the assignment clerk contact you, we\u2019ll set it for a one hour noncontested hearing at the next available. I don\u2019t know when that is. It won\u2019t be less than the two weeks you said. It more than likely will be sometime after the first of the year.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-9\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cAnd, ma\u2019am, the only way you can get that set aside is to get a proper motion filed asking for permission to now file your answer late and then I\u2019ll sign that and then you can file your answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-10\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cBut again, I don\u2019t think you can do that by yourself. Get an attorney and they\u2019ll file it, they know how to do that, that is what they\u2019re paid for. That is what they go to school for at least seven years to learn how to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-11\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cWe sent this case to mediation. I got a mediation report. That didn\u2019t result in any sort of agreement, so apparently I have some sort of underlying custody issue here. Again, this strengthens my statement that you can\u2019t do this by yourself.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-12\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cFirst of all, if you don\u2019t get something properly filed you come in here on an uncontested hearing, Mr. Sheets is going to conduct a hearing and you\u2019ll sit there and be an observer. That is the way it works.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-13\">{\u00b6 16} \u201cAre there any other issues that we can help settle; are there real estate issues or property issues?</p>\n<p id=\"b194-14\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cMR. SHEETS: Not that I\u2019m aware of, no.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-15\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cMRS. RUE: Yes, there is property that needs to be divided but not real estate but personal property.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-16\">{\u00b6 19} \u201cTHE COURT: Okay. Again, unless you get something done here, you\u2019re not even sitting here properly to contest any of those issues. Nothing is before me that is being contested at this point. You need to get something done.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-17\">{\u00b6 20} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b194-18\">{\u00b6 21} \u201cTHE COURT: * * *. Mr. Sheets, you\u2019ve got a motion here about an interview with the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>{\u00b6 22} \u201cMR. SHEETS: Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">{\u00b6 23} \u201cTHE COURT: If the matter is not contested, we certainly won\u2019t need to do that.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">{\u00b6 24} \u201cMR. SHEETS: Understood.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">{\u00b6 25} \u201cTHE COURT: If the matter \u2014 if we get a contest then certainly I\u2019ll consider that. How old is the child?</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">{\u00b6 26} \u201cMRS. RUE: 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-9\">{\u00b6 27} \u201cTHE COURT: Certainly at the age that I do interview the children then if there is a contest of those issues. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b195-10\">{\u00b6 28} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b195-11\">{\u00b6 29} \u201cTHE COURT: You need to file an answer, you need to get an attorney to represent you if you want to get involved in contesting these issues. It\u2019s just, there is no other way to do it.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-12\">{\u00b6 30} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b195-13\">{\u00b6 31} \u201cTHE COURT: All right. There you go. Anything else?</p>\n<p id=\"b195-14\">{\u00b6 32} \u201cMRS. RUE: Not at this present time, but there is other property.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-15\">{\u00b6 33} \u201cTHE COURT: Well, again, that is not even before me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b195-16\">{\u00b6 34} The final hearing was held December 16, 2005. Again, Mr. Rue was present with his attorney. Mrs. Rue was present, but was not represented by counsel. At the outset of that hearing, the trial court informed Mrs. Rue: \u201c[Y]ou haven\u2019t filed any answer or any counterclaim, anything of that nature, so you\u2019re going to be very limited as to your input today. We\u2019re not here contesting anything; there is nothing before the Court to be contested.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b195-17\">{\u00b6 35} Mr. Rue was called as a witness on his behalf. He testified that he and Mrs. Rue were incompatible, without <em>going </em>into any details. He then stated that he was \u201csatisfied with the division of property as it now stands\u201d and that he desired that the court name him as the residential parent. He indicated that there was no agreement to that effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-18\">{\u00b6 36} The trial court then asked Mr. Rue\u2019s counsel to go through a list of the divided property, for the record. The following colloquy ensued:</p>\n<p id=\"b195-19\">{\u00b6 37} \u201cTHE COURT: Your household goods and furnishings, you\u2019re telling me you have divided those?</p>\n<p id=\"b195-20\">{\u00b6 38} \u201cMRS. RUE: (INDECIPHERABLE).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-21\">{\u00b6 39} \u201cTHE COURT: To your mutual satisfaction or\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b195-22\">{\u00b6 40} \u201cMR. RUE: She hasn\u2019t told me what she wanted or anything.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>{\u00b6 41} \u201cMRS. RUE: I have, Your Honor, several times. I\u2019ve advised several times over the last several months and he refuses to and neglects to give me any of my property.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">{\u00b6 42} \u201cTHE COURT: Again, you haven\u2019t filed any answer or anything in this case. I\u2019m not here \u2014 I\u2019m not going to contest this stuff. Unless you two can work out what you\u2019re going to do with this property, you\u2019re going to each keep what you have in your own possession now.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">{\u00b6 43} There was then a discussion of particular items of personal property, interrupted by the following colloquy:</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">{\u00b6 44} \u201cTHE COURT: You said something about some wedding band, what are you talking about?</p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">{\u00b6 45} \u201cMR. RUE: The wedding band set that I gotten [sic], she gave that to me when she was heading out the door.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-9\">{\u00b6 46} \u201cTHE COURT: What does that consist of?</p>\n<p id=\"b196-10\">{\u00b6 47} \u201cMR. RUE: There an\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b196-11\">{\u00b6 48} \u201cMRS. RUE: An engagement ring and a band.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-12\">{\u00b6 49} \u201cTHE COURT: I\u2019m talking to him now. I don\u2019t want to hear you anymore unless you\u2019re asked a question. You understand that? Just destructive of what is going on here.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b196-13\">{\u00b6 50} Following Mr. Rue\u2019s testimony concerning the property and debts of the parties, the trial court asked Mrs. Rue if she was contesting grounds, and she stated: \u201cWe are incompatible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b196-14\">{\u00b6 51} Later, the trial court asked Mr. Rue whether he was seeking spousal support, and he said that he was not. The trial court inquired of both parties concerning their income and expenses for purposes of determining child support. Without any testimony on the subject, and without eliciting the views of either party other than having initially ascertained that Mr. Rue was seeking to be named the residential parent, the trial court announced that it was awarding custody of the children to Mr. Rue, with a standard order of visitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-15\">{\u00b6 52} There was some discussion of the car that was being awarded to Mr. Rue. The trial court noted that Mrs. Rue\u2019s request that the car be refinanced to remove her liability as a co-obligor on the loan financing that car was reasonable and ordered it done. There was a discussion of a boat that was supposedly titled in the name of Mrs. Rue\u2019s grandfather, but with that certificate of title having been lost. The trial court determined that it had no jurisdiction over the boat.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-16\">{\u00b6 53} Finally, the trial court asked whether Mrs. Rue wanted to return to her maiden name, and she said that she did; the trial court said that he would sign an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>order to that effect. The hearing then concluded. Although the trial court occasionally questioned Mrs. Rue on matters, she was never afforded an opportunity to cross-examine Mr. Rue, to call witnesses on her own behalf, or to argue concerning the division of property, child custody, or child support.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">{\u00b6 54} On March 3, 2006, the trial court entered a final decree of divorce that, among other things, named Mr. Rue as the residential parent of the parties\u2019 children. From the judgment and decree of divorce, Mrs. Rue appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">{\u00b6 55} Mrs. Rue\u2019s sole assignment of error is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">{\u00b6 56} \u201cThe trial court erred in not considering the best interest of children under R.C. 3109.04\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b197-9\">{\u00b6 57} From the record, it is apparent that the trial court concluded that because Mrs. Rue had not filed an answer, she could not contest any of the issues in the divorce, including the issue of which parent should be named the residential parent. Therefore, the trial court reasoned, there was nothing for it to consider. Mrs. Rue was not permitted to present any evidence or argument concerning the best interests of the children, and the trial court had no evidence before it on this subject beyond Mr. Rue\u2019s bare assertion of his desire to be named the residential parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-10\">{\u00b6 58} In his brief, Mr. Rue notes:</p>\n<p id=\"b197-11\">{\u00b6 59} \u201cThe basis of Appellant\u2019s argument is that the trial court erred in not permitting her to participate in the Final Hearing due to her failure to file an answer and that it further erred by not stating findings of fact related to the best interests of the children under R.C. 3109.04. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b197-12\">{\u00b6 60} \u201cIt must be remembered that Appellant failed to file an answer to the complaint and, as such, was in default. Generally, a party in default cannot otherwise appear and attempt to defend the action. In fact, the Civil Rules provide that a party in default need not even be served with further documents in the matter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b197-13\">{\u00b6 61} We agree with Mr. Rue that the essence of Mrs. Rue\u2019s argument is that the trial court erred by, in effect, rendering a default judgment of divorce against her without permitting her to participate meaningfully in the trial. We agree with Mrs. Rue that this was, in fact, reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-14\">{\u00b6 62} The provision of the Ohio Rules of Civil Procedure concerning default judgment, to which Mr. Rue refers, is Civ.R. 55. Civ.R. 75(F) provides: \u201cThe provisions of Civ.R. 55 shall not apply in * * * divorce, annulment, [or] legal separation [actions].\u201d This is consistent with the trial court\u2019s independent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>obligations: (1) pursuant to R.C. 3105.171(B) to divide the marital and separate property equitably between the parties; and (2) pursuant to R.C. 3109.04(A) \u201cafter hearing the testimony of either or both parents,\u201d to allocate the parental rights and responsibilities for the care of the minor children of the marriage \u201cin a manner consistent with the best interest of the children.\u201d The performance of this independent judicial duty does not lend itself to judgment by default.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">{\u00b6 63} A divorce litigant may not be prevented from presenting evidence because the litigant has failed to file an answer. <em>Campbell v. Campbell </em>(Aug. 13, 1993), Gallia App. No. 92 CA 39, 1993 WL 307535. We approve and follow <em>Campbell v. Campbell.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">{\u00b6 64} It may be good case management for a domestic-relations court to maintain a separate docket for noncontested divorces, and we are aware that this is a venerable practice within some of the counties in our jurisdiction. But the fact that a divorce litigant has not filed an answer does not prevent the litigant from contesting one or more issues in the divorce. In the occasional case, this may mean that a case set for hearing on the noncontested docket may have to be reset for the contested docket because the nonanswering, and hitherto unassertive, defendant shows up at the hearing intending to contest one or more issues. In this case, though, the pretrial conference alerted the trial court to the fact that this was a contested case, despite the fact that Mrs. Rue had not answered the complaint, so there was an opportunity to reset the case on the contested docket.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">{\u00b6 65} The trial court also seems to have been under the impression that a divorce litigant may not proceed pro se. It may be almost as unwise for a divorce litigant to proceed pro se as it is for a defendant in a capital murder case to do so, but a divorce litigant, unlike a criminal defendant, has no right to the appointment of counsel at state\u2019s expense if the litigant is indigent. A divorce litigant who cannot afford an attorney is not thereby barred from being heard. To hold otherwise would violate the Due Process and Equal Protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and the Open Courts provision in Article I, Section 16 of the Ohio Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">{\u00b6 66} Mrs. Rue\u2019s sole assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-9\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b198-10\">{\u00b6 67} Mrs. Rue\u2019s sole assignment of error having been sustained, that part of the judgment of the trial court awarding a divorce is affirmed, both parties having agreed, in open court, that they are incompatible. The judgment of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>trial court is reversed in all other respects, and this cause is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b199-6\">Brogan and Walters, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b199-7\">Sumner E.
