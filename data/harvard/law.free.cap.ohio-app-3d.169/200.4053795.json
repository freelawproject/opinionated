Finding no merit to the appeal, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">{\u00b6 2} In 2005, Paschal was charged with drug possession. He moved to suppress the evidence found in his vehicle. The following evidence was presented at the suppression hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">{\u00b6 3} Officer Robles was patrolling the area of West 85th Street and Lorain Avenue because he had received numerous drug complaints in that area. At around 9:00 p.m., he observed two men sitting in a car parked in front of a boarded-up house that had been recently raided by police. He observed the men leaning together as if they were looking at something between them. Robles testified that he did not find this suspicious, but rather, he found it \u201codd.\u201d He also found it odd that when he pulled his police cruiser alongside the parked car, the men looked at him in surprise and said, \u201cHow are you doing, officer?\u201d Although he had had the opportunity to speak to the men, Robles testified that he did not. Instead, he pulled his cruiser into a driveway to turn around.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">{\u00b6 4} Robles testified that he wanted to get the license plate number from the car and to observe what the occupants were doing. However, when he pulled into the driveway, he looked back and saw the passenger \u201cjump out of the car\u201d and run up the driveway toward the boarded-up house. Robles testified that as soon as the passenger exited the car, the driver, later identified as Paschal, \u201csped away.\u201d At that time, Robles decided to pursue Paschal because he believed he had just interrupted a drug transaction. By the time he turned the police cruiser around and caught up with Paschal\u2019s vehicle, Paschal had already traveled \u201ca good quarter mile.\u201d Although Robles testified that Paschal was exceeding the speed limit, Robles was not \u201crunning radar,\u201d nor did he cite Paschal for any traffic violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-9\">{\u00b6 5} After Robles stopped Paschal, he approached the car and asked him what he was doing back there and the identity of his passenger. Paschal was unable to give any coherent answer; instead, he \u201chemmed and hawed.\u201d Robles asked Paschal to step out of the car, and then Robles observed in plain view a rock of crack cocaine on the floorboard of the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-10\">{\u00b6 6} Following the hearing, the trial court granted Paschal\u2019s motion, finding that the Terry stop was based on the officer\u2019s hunch and not on any reasonable and articulable facts. See <em>Terry v. Ohio </em>(1968), 392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>{\u00b6 7} The state appeals, arguing in its sole assignment of error that the trial court erred in granting Paschal\u2019s motion to suppress because the officer had reasonable suspicion of criminal activity based on specific and articulable facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">{\u00b6 8} At a hearing on a motion to suppress, the trial court functions as the trier of fact, because the trial court is in the best position to weigh the evidence by resolving factual questions and evaluating the credibility of the witnesses. <em>State v. Mills </em>(1992), 62 Ohio St.3d 357, 582 N.E.2d 972. On review, an appellate court must accept the trial court\u2019s findings of fact if they are supported by competent, credible evidence. <em>State v. Harris </em>(1994), 98 Ohio App.3d 543, 546, 649 N.E.2d 7. After accepting those factual findings, the reviewing court must independently determine as a matter of law whether the applicable legal standard has been satisfied. <em>State v. Lloyd </em>(1998), 126 Ohio App.3d 95, 709 N.E.2d 913.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">{\u00b6 9} In the seminal case of <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. at 9, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889, the United States Supreme Court explained that the Fourth Amendment allows a police officer to stop and detain an individual if the officer possesses a reasonable suspicion, based upon specific and articulable facts, that criminal activity \u201cmay be afoot.\u201d See, also, <em>State v. Andrews </em>(1991), 57 Ohio St.3d 86, 565 N.E.2d 1271. A valid investigative stop must be based upon more than an inchoate and unparticularized suspicion or hunch that criminal activity is afoot. <em>United States v. Arvizu </em>(2002), 534 U.S. 266, 122 S.Ct. 744, 151 L.Ed.2d 740. <em>Terry, </em>392 U.S. at 27, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">{\u00b6 10} In deciding whether reasonable suspicion exists, courts must examine the \u201c \u2018totality of the circumstances\u2019 of each case to [determine] whether the detaining officer has a \u2018particularized and objective basis\u2019 for suspecting legal wrongdoing.\u201d <em>Arvizu, </em>534 U.S. at 273, 122 S.Ct. 744, 151 L.Ed.2d 740, quoting <em>United States v. Cortez </em>(1981), 449 U.S. 411, 417-418, 101 S.Ct. 690, 66 L.Ed.2d 621; <em>State v. Bobo </em>(1988), 37 Ohio St.3d 177, 524 N.E.2d 489, paragraph one of the syllabus, citing <em>State v. Freeman </em>(1980), 64 Ohio St.2d 291, 18 O.O.3d 472, 414 N.E.2d 1044.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">{\u00b6 11} Under this totality-of-the-circumstances approach, police officers are permitted to \u201cdraw on their own experience and specialized training to make inferences from and deductions about the cumulative information available to them that \u2018might well elude an untrained person.\u2019 \u201d <em>Arvizu, </em>534 U.S. at 273, 122 S.Ct. 744, 151 L.Ed.2d 740, quoting <em>Cortez, </em>449 U.S. at 418, 101 S.Ct. 690, 66 L.Ed.2d 621. Thus, a court reviewing the officer\u2019s reasonable-suspicion determination must give due weight to the officer\u2019s trained eye and experience and view the evidence through the eyes of those in law enforcement. Id. See, also, <em>Andrews, </em>57 Ohio St.3d at 87-88, 565 N.E.2d 1271.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>{\u00b6 12} The state argues that Paschal\u2019s driving away after his passenger jumped out of his vehicle constituted unprovoked flight. It further argues that these actions, coupled with the fact that the men were parked in front of a house that had been recently raided for drugs, created reasonable suspicion justifying Officer Robles\u2019s investigative stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">{\u00b6 13} In support of its arguments, the state cites <em>Illinois v. Wardlow </em>(2000), 528 U.S. 119, 125, 120 S.Ct. 673, 145 L.Ed.2d 570, in which the United States Supreme Court held that presence in a high crime area, coupled with unprovoked flight at the sight of a police officer, constitutes reasonable suspicion to justify a stop.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-6\">Such a holding is entirely consistent with our decision in <em>Florida v. Royer </em>[ (1983) 460 U.S. 491, 498, 103 S.Ct. 1319, 75 L.Ed.2d 229], where we held that when an officer, without reasonable suspicion or probable cause, approaches an individual, the individual has a right to ignore the police and go about his business. Id. at 498, 103 S.Ct. 1319, 75 L.Ed.2d 229. And any \u2018refusal to cooperate, without more, does not furnish the minimal level of objective justification needed for a detention or seizure.\u2019 <em>Florida v. Bostick, </em>501 U.S. 429, 437, 111 S.Ct. 2382, 115 L.Ed.2d 389 (1991). But unprovoked flight is simply not a mere refusal to cooperate. Flight, by its very nature, is not \u2018going about one\u2019s business\u2019; in fact, it is just the opposite. Allowing officers confronted with such flight to stop the fugitive and investigate further is quite consistent with the individual\u2019s right to go about his business or to stay put and remain silent in the face of police questioning.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">{\u00b6 14} The state also directs us to <em>State v. Jordan, </em>104 Ohio St.3d 21, 2004-Ohio-6085, 817 N.E.2d 864, in which the Ohio Supreme Court, relying on <em>Wardlow, </em>held that unprovoked flight upon seeing police officers is a relevant consideration in determining whether the facts and circumstances are sufficiently suspicious to justify a <em>Terry </em>stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">{\u00b6 15} However, we find both <em>Wardlow </em>and <em>Jordan </em>distinguishable because in both of those cases, the unprovoked flight occurred immediately after seeing the police. In <em>Wardlow, </em>eight officers in a four-car caravan were patrolling a heavy drug-trafficking area to investigate drug transactions. They anticipated encountering a large number of people, including drug customers and individuals serving as lookouts. Two of the officers observed Wardlow standing next to a building. Wardlow looked in the officers\u2019 direction and immediately fled on foot. He was found with a handgun and ammunition.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-9\">{\u00b6 16} In <em>Jordan, </em>a uniformed officer was responding to an anonymous tip that drug activity was occurring at a particular house. When he arrived in a marked police vehicle, Jordan, who was seated on the porch, shouted something, and his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>male companion immediately fled the scene on foot. A crack pipe was found in Jordan\u2019s pocket.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">{\u00b6 17} In both of those cases, the courts held that the immediate flight, coupled with the circumstances surrounding each case, gave the officers reasonable suspicion to justify a <em>Terry </em>stop. However, immediate flight is not present in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">{\u00b6 18} In the instant case, Robles testified that when he pulled his cruiser beside Paschal\u2019s car, both men looked over at him and said, \u201cHow are you doing, officer?\u201d Although he found this \u201codd,\u201d he stated that he did not find this suspicious. Robles did not activate his cruiser\u2019s overhead lights or issue an order to the occupants of the vehicle, although he testified that he could have done so. Instead, he pulled in a driveway to turn around. It was then that the passenger exited the vehicle and that Paschal drove away. To constitute unprovoked flight, Paschal would have had to immediately speed away when Officer Robles pulled beside Paschal\u2019s car.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">{\u00b6 19} The state suggests that instead of driving off, Paschal \u201ccould have simply stayed put, and gone about his business.\u201d However, it is possible that Paschal was going about his business when he drove off. Paschal had no reason to believe that he was not free to leave. Robles admitted that Paschal was free to leave the area. Robles did not activate his lights or order Paschal to remain at the scene. Instead, Robles pulled in a driveway to turn around.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">{\u00b6 20} Although we find this to be a close case, we must accept the trial court\u2019s findings of fact if they are supported by competent and credible evidence. <em>Harris, </em>98 Ohio App.3d 543, 649 N.E.2d 7. The trial court found that Officer Robles effectuated the <em>Terry </em>stop on a hunch. Competent and credible evidence exists to support the trial court\u2019s findings. Officer Robles testified that he did not know what the occupants of the car were doing but found their behavior of leaning together \u201codd.\u201d He stated that he believed he had interrupted a drug transaction, which was why he pursued Paschal.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\"> {\u00b6 21} Therefore, we hold that the court\u2019s decision regarding the <em>Terry </em>stop is supported by competent, credible evidence, and we thus affirm the court\u2019s decision. We also point out that the deference granted the trial court in its findings of fact is important and should be adhered to, especially in cases that are a very close call. In addition, \u201cwhen we weigh the court\u2019s legal determinations, \u2018we will indulge all reasonable presumptions consistent with the record in favor of [the] lower court.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Coppock </em>(1995), 103 Ohio App.3d 405, 411, 659 N.E.2d 837, quoting <em>Fletcher v. Fletcher </em>(1994), 68 Ohio St.3d 464, 468, 628 N.E.2d 1343.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-9\">{\u00b6 22} Accordingly, the assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-10\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b238-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>Celebrezze Jr., P.J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b238-5\">Corrigan, J., dissents.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b238-6\">Corrigan, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Ao\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">{\u00b6 23} I respectfully dissent because I believe that consistent with <em>Illinois v. Wardlow </em>(2000), 528 U.S. 119, 120 S.Ct. 673, 145 L.Ed.2d 570, the police officer had a reasonable suspicion that criminal activity might be occurring based on the flight of one of the occupants of the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">{\u00b6 24} The majority\u2019s attempt to distinguish <em>Wardlow </em>on the basis that the flight did not occur \u201cimmediately\u201d after seeing the officer is both legally and factually incorrect. Nowhere in <em>Wardlow </em>does the Supreme Court speak of a temporal nexus between the sighting of a police officer and a person\u2019s flight from the officer. As in all <em>Terry </em>cases, the unique facts and circumstances of each situation dictate whether an officer\u2019s suspicion is objectively reasonable. The mechanistic time restraints that the majority uses in attempting to distinguish <em>Wardlow </em>are inconsistent with the totality-of-the-circumstances approach used in these kinds of cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-9\">{\u00b6 25} In any event, the undisputed facts show that immediate flight did occur. The officer testified that \u201cseconds\u201d had elapsed from the time he pulled up to Paschal\u2019s car and the time Paschal\u2019s passenger \u201ctook off.\u201d This amounted to the time it took to pull into the next driveway and turn around. Even under the majority\u2019s tortured reading of <em>Wardlow, </em>this lapse of time was immediate enough to arouse suspicion and justify a <em>Terry </em>stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-10\">{\u00b6 26} The majority questions whether the officer was \u201csuspicious,\u201d quoting him as saying that he merely found the situation odd. This is an incomplete view of the record. Defense counsel asked the officer, \u201c[D]id you find it suspicious that they were looking at something and sort of huddled together in the middle of the car? Did you find that suspicious?\u201d The officer answered, \u201cThat drew my attention to them.\u201d The officer testified that he suspected that a drug transaction had been occurring and pulled his car around to get a better look at the license plate.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-11\">{\u00b6 27} Obviously, the officer thought that two men, huddled together in a car in front of a boarded-up drug house, were suspicious enough to warrant a record check. When Paschal\u2019s passenger took off running just seconds after seeing the officer, a <em>Terry </em>stop was justified.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
