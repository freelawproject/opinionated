Appellees were constructing a residential home and hired appellee Newark Builders Supply, Inc., a subcontractor, to perform drywall work. Newark in turn hired independent contractors Jonathon Rockett and Jayson Hastings to sand the drywall. On October 22, 2003, Mr. Rockett, while sanding a wall near a drop-off, fell to the basement floor and subsequently died.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">{\u00b6 2} On April 16, 2004, appellant, Jeffrey Rockett, Mr. Rockett\u2019s father, filed a complaint, individually and as the administrator of his son\u2019s estate, against appellees, claiming negligence, the Ohio frequenter statutes, R.C. 4101.11 and 4101.12, and wrongful death.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">{\u00b6 3} Appellees filed motions for summary judgment. By judgment entry filed November 21, 2005, the trial court granted the motions in favor of appellees, finding that they did not owe a duty of care to provide for the safety of Mr. Rockett.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-9\">{\u00b6 4} Appellant filed an appeal and this matter is now before this court for consideration. Assignments of error are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b412-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b412-11\">{\u00b6 5} \u201cThe trial court committed reversible error by granting defendants/appellees John Wilson and Arrow Homes Services, LLC\u2019s motion for summary judgment on all of plaintiff/appellant Rockett\u2019s claims.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b412-12\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b412-13\">{\u00b6 6} \u201cThe trial court committed reversible error by granting defendant/appellee Newark Builders Supply, Inc.\u2019s motion for summary judgment on all of plaintifflappellant Rockett\u2019s claims.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b412-14\">I, II</p>\n<p id=\"b412-15\">{\u00b6 7} Appellant\u2019s two assignments of error challenge the trial court\u2019s decision granting summary judgment to appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-16\">{\u00b6 8} Summary judgment motions are to be resolved in light of the dictates of Civ.R. 56, which was reaffirmed by the Supreme Court of Ohio in <em>State ex rel. Zimmerman v. Tompkins </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 447, 448, 663 N.E.2d 639:</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>{\u00b6 9} \u201cCiv.R. 56(C) provides that before summary judgment may be granted, it must be determined that (1) no genuine issue as to any material fact remains to be litigated, (2) the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and (3) it appears from the evidence that reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion, and viewing such evidence most strongly in favor of the nonmoving party, that conclusion is adverse to the party against whom the motion for summary judgment is made. <em>State ex. rel. Parsons v. Fleming </em>(1994), 68 Ohio St.3d 509, 511, 628 N.E.2d 1377, 1379, citing <em>Temple v. Wean United, Inc. </em>(1977), 50 Ohio St.2d 317, 327, 4 O.O.3d 466, 472, 364 N.E.2d 267, 274.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">{\u00b6 10} As an appellate court reviewing summary judgment motions, we must stand in the shoes of the trial court and review summary judgments on the same standard and evidence as the trial court. <em>Smiddy v. Wedding Party, Inc. </em>(1987), 30 Ohio St.3d 35, 30 OBR 78, 506 N.E.2d 212.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">{\u00b6 11} Appellant argues that there are genuine issues of material fact as to whether the removal of scaffolding and a guardrail by Arrow and/or Newark constituted \u201cactive participation,\u201d thereby creating a duty of care. Further, appellant argues that the erection of the scaffolding and the guardrail by Arrow and/or Newark created an assumed duty to protect appellant. In arguing \u201cactive participation,\u201d appellant cites <em>Hirschbach v. Cincinnati Gas &amp; Elec. Co. </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St.3d 206, 6 OBR 259, 452 N.E.2d 326, syllabus, wherein the Supreme Court of Ohio held the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cOne who engages the services of an independent contractor, and who actually participates in the job operation performed by such contractor and thereby fails to eliminate a hazard which he, in the exercise of ordinary care, could have eliminated, can be held responsible for the injury or death of an employee of the independent contractor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b413-8\">{\u00b6 13} The \u201cactive participation\u201d doctrine has been defined and redefined by the Supreme Court of Ohio. Before liability can attach, it is necessary to determine the existence of a duty. In the seminal case of <em>Cafferkey v. Turner Constr. Co. </em>(1986), 21 Ohio St.3d 110, 21 OBR 416, 488 N.E.2d 189, the Supreme Court of Ohio sought to define the duty of a general contractor to independent contractors on a job site. In discussing the \u201cinherent risk\u201d theory of <em>Hirschbach, </em>supra, <em>Cafferkey </em>at 112, 21 OBR 416, 488 N.E.2d 189, emphasized that the duty to eliminate an inherent risk arises only if there is active participation by the general contractor. The <em>Cafferkey </em>court set forth the following rule at syllabus: \u201cA general contractor who has not actively participated in the subcontractor\u2019s work, does not, merely by virtue of its supervisory capacity, owe a duty of care to employees of the subcontractor who are injured while engaged in inherently dangerous work.\u201d As to the facts, the <em>Cafferkey </em>court held that mere knowledge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>of activities does not give rise to active participation. Id. at 112, 21 OBR 416, 488 N.E.2d 189.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">{\u00b6 14} Nearly a decade later, the Supreme Court of Ohio again addressed the \u201cactive participation\u201d rule in <em>Bond v. Howard Corp. </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 332, 650 N.E.2d 416. The <em>Bond </em>court held the following at syllabus:</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cFor purposes of establishing liability to the injured employee of an independent subcontractor, \u2018actively participated\u2019 means that the general contractor directed the activity which resulted in the injury and/or gave or denied permission for the critical acts that led to the employee\u2019s injury, rather than merely exercising a general supervisory role over the project. <em>(Cafferkey v. Turner Constr. Co. </em>[1986], 21 Ohio St.3d 110, 21 OBR 416, 488 N.E.2d 189, construed and applied.)\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">{\u00b6 16} The <em>Bond </em>court rejected as active participation the general contractor\u2019s supervisory capacity regarding compliance with safety laws and regulations. Id. at 334, 650 N.E.2d 416.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">{\u00b6 17} Therefore, it is our duty under our scope of review to determine whether the facts sub judice rise to \u201cactive participation\u201d by appellees. As stated previously, under a summary judgment review, the facts must be construed in a light most favorable to the nonmoving party, i.e., appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">{\u00b6 18} Pursuant to this standard, it is presumed that Arrow installed the guardrail and, by inference, that Arrow removed the scaffolding prior to the incident. It is also presumed that Newark removed the guardrail erected by Arrow, but installed the scaffolding for the drywall work. It is undisputed that Arrow was off the job and not present the day of the incident. It is also undisputed that Arrow was the general contractor who hired Newark, a subcontractor, to do the drywall work on the house. Newark hired independent contractors Mr. Rockett and Mr. Hastings to sand the drywall. No Arrow or Newark employees were at the job site the day of the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-9\">{\u00b6 19} It is appellant\u2019s position that Arrow, by removing the scaffolding and installing the guardrail, and Newark, by removing the guardrail and installing the scaffolding, exercised control over a critical variable and therefore created \u201cactive participation\u201d in the acts of Mr. Rockett and Mr. Hastings.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-10\">{\u00b6 20} In our review, the Supreme Court of Ohio\u2019s decisions do not favor such an analysis of \u201cactive participation.\u201d There is no evidence that Arrow directed any of the activity of Mr. Rockett and Mr. Hastings or that it gave or denied permission for critical acts that led to the injury. In particular, the assumption of enforcing safety rules and regulations does not give rise to \u201cactive participation.\u201d <em>Bond, </em>72 Ohio St.3d at 334, 650 N.E.2d 416.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>{\u00b6 21} Appellant argues that under the holding of <em>Sopkovich v. Ohio Edison Co. </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 628, 693 N.E.2d 233, the Supreme Court of Ohio extended the active-participation doctrine. Although the <em>Sopkovich </em>court did address active participation, it limited it strictly to the owner of the property, Ohio Edison, and its exclusive control and communication over deactivation of electrical lines. Id. at 643, 693 N.E.2d 233. Therefore, we find that the holding of <em>Sopkovich </em>does not expand on the active-participation doctrine as applied to a general contractor who did not have exclusive control over the subcontractor and/or independent contractors.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">{\u00b6 22} We specifically find that the removal of the guardrail and installation of the scaffolding by Newark and the removal of the scaffolding and the installation of the guardrail by Arrow prior to the entrance of Mr. Rockett and Mr. Hastings on the job site, as well as the absence of appellees on the job site on the day of the incident, do not equate to active participation.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">{\u00b6 23} Therefore, under the facts cited and argued as true by appellant, we find that the trial court was correct in granting summary judgment to appellees, because appellant failed to establish a duty owed by appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">{\u00b6 24} Assignments of Error I and II are denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">{\u00b6 25} The judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Licking County, Ohio is hereby affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b415-10\">Edwards, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b415-11\">Hoffman, P.J., dissents.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b415-12\">Hoffman, Presiding Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AOK\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-13\">{\u00b6 26} I respectfully dissent from the majority opinion. Specifically, I disagree with the majority\u2019s limitation of <em>Sopkovich v. Ohio Edison Co. </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 628, 693 N.E.2d 233, to the owner of the property upon which the incident occurred. I find that the holding of <em>Sopkovich </em>should be equally applied to a general or subcontractor who has exercised authority or control over the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-14\">{\u00b6 27} In the instant action, I find that reasonable minds could come to differing conclusions as to whether the guard rails and scaffolding are \u201ccritical variables\u201d in the workplace. I also find that reasonable minds could come to differing conclusions as to whether appellees in this case retained or exercised control over those variables. Accordingly, I would reverse the decision of the trial court and remand the matter for jury trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
