By judgment entry filed April 18, 2005, the trial court denied the request.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">{\u00b6 3} On April 26, 2005, appellant filed a motion to reconsider the request. A hearing was held on May 13, 2005. By judgment entry filed May 16, 2005, the trial court once again denied the request.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">{\u00b6 4} An adjudicatory hearing before a magistrate was held on May 24, 2005. By decision filed June 7, 2005, the magistrate found appellant to be a delinquent child. Appellant filed objections. By judgment entry filed January 5, 2006, the trial court denied the objections and affirmed the magistrate\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">{\u00b6 5} Appellant filed an appeal and this matter is now before this court for consideration. Assignments of error are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">{\u00b6 6} \u201cThe trial court committed harmful error in denying the request of the trial counsel for the appellant to order an evaluation of the child to determine her competency to stand for adjudication.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b364-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b364-10\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cThe trial court committed harmful error in proceeding with the adjudication of the child when the record failed to demonstrate that she was able to understand the nature of the proceedings and assist in her own defense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b364-11\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b364-12\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cThe trial court committed harmful error in overruling the child\u2019s objections to the magistrate\u2019s adjudication of her as an alleged delinquent child as the record fails to demonstrate that she was legally competent to proceed with the adjudicatory hearing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b364-13\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b364-14\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cThe record created below is insufficient to demonstrate, by proof beyond a reasonable doubt, that the child was delinquent for committing the acts specified in the complaint filed against the child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b364-15\">I, II, III</p>\n<p id=\"b364-16\">{\u00b6 10} These assignments challenge the trial court\u2019s procedure on the issue of appellant\u2019s competency to stand trial. Appellant claims that the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>court erred in failing to appoint an expert under Juv.R. 32 on the issue of competency. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\">{\u00b6 11} The decision to appoint an expert to evaluate competency lies within the trial court\u2019s sound discretion. Juv.R. 32(A). In order to find an abuse of that discretion, we must determine that the trial court\u2019s decision was unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable, and not merely an error of law or judgment. <em>Blakemore v. Blakemore </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 5 OBR 481, 450 N.E.2d 1140.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">{\u00b6 12} It is not contested by either party that appellant is entitled to be competent and to participate in her own defense and hearing. Juv.R. 32 governs social history, physical examination, and mental examination before adjudication and states:</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cThe court may order and utilize a social history or physical or mental examination at any time after the filing of a complaint under any of the following circumstances:</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">{\u00b6 14} \u201c(1) Upon the request of the party concerning whom the history or examination is to be made;</p>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">{\u00b6 15} \u201c(4) Where a party\u2019s legal responsibility for the party\u2019s acts or the party\u2019s competence to participate in the proceedings is an issue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b365-9\">{\u00b6 16} In appellant\u2019s April 14, 2005 motion for evaluation of competency to face adjudication and sanity, defense counsel stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b365-10\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cCounsel\u2019s contact with Ms. [H.] and her family has caused her concern about her ability to appreciate the instant proceedings, assist in her own defense and understand the nature of her actions. As Ms. [H.] is currently indigent, it is requested that it be ordered that the evaluation be performed at public expense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b365-11\">{\u00b6 18} The trial court sua sponte denied the motion without hearing, finding that \u201c[i]t was not apparent to this Court by her demeanor or any other factor that the child was incompetent or suffers from any mental deficiencies warranting a mental evaluation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b365-12\">{\u00b6 19} On April 26, 2005, appellant filed a motion for reconsideration. By judgment entry filed April 28, 2005, the trial court ordered the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b365-13\">{\u00b6 20} \u201c1. The Court shall immediately appoint a guardian <em>ad litem </em>to represent the child\u2019s best interests. The guardian <em>ad litem </em>shall interview the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-14\">{\u00b6 21} \u201c2. The motion for reconsideration shall come before the Court for an oral hearing. The child shall attend, as well as all other parties, legal counsel for the juvenile, the guardian <em>ad litem, </em>and an assistant prosecuting attorney. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>Court will hear <em>evidence and argument </em>in support of the motion for reconsideration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">{\u00b6 22} During the hearing, the state did not oppose the competency evaluation and pretrial psychological examination. Defense counsel explained to the trial court the reason for the request for the competency evaluation and accompanied the explanation with appellant\u2019s Individualized Education Program (\u201cI-E-P\u201d) test scores:</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">{\u00b6 23} \u201cIn my representation and contact with Ms. [H.] and in interviews with her family thus far I do have concern as to whether she is able to assist me in her defense and understand the nature of her actions and appreciate the instant proceedings. Ms. [H.] has limited communication abilities which are making it difficult to prepare her defense as her counsel and I\u2019m unsure if these limitations from our conversations are due to immaturity or competency and thus have requested a professional psychologist to determine so. Further, although it\u2019s not readily apparent on the surface, Ms. [H.] does \u2014 has suffered from family history that most children and young teenagers fortunately haven\u2019t had to live through. She\u2019s witnessed abuse in her family. She has lost both parents at one time or other \u2014 another and has been in and out of foster care homes since she was nine. Not surprisingly Ms. [H.] has been seeing and has seen counselors in the past for both emotional mental concerns. Currently [B.H.] is enrolled as an eighth grade student but she is in special ed classes and she\u2019s in the middle school but acting under an I-E-P to accommodate the lower functioning. And I do apologize for not attaching it to the motion. I just obtained her I-E-P today and the I-E-P does state that she is reading and comprehending at an upper second grade level so she\u2019s not at the functioning level of an eighth grader.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">{\u00b6 24} The guardian ad litem further substantiated appellant\u2019s request as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">{\u00b6 25} \u201cI found [B.H.] to be a very happy, bubbly child and that\u2019s exactly the word I would use is child. She is fomteen years of age. She is going to be going into high school. However, her emotional abilities and her emotional personality is much younger than that of a fourteen-year-old and I had serious concerns when I did speak with her with regard to her level of understanding. I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s necessarily competency, however, if you look at the Rules, I believe it\u2019s a child of seven, age seven and under or perhaps it\u2019s six, a child under that age is presumed incompetent so \u2014 and if you look at what the I-E-P states which is that she\u2019s reading at a second grade level, that\u2019s a child of seven and eight years old. So I believe it would be in the best interest for her to have a psychological evaluation to at least determine whether she really understands the seriousness of these proceedings, whether she understands the wrongfulness of her acts in this matter. She does have a very, very horrible living history. She <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>has been in no less than ten placements over her lifetime which is a very short period of time considering, and she\u2019s been bounced around, and there are history of sexual molestation and rape, and accusations of molestation throughout her family. So I do believe it would be in her best interest to have a psychological evaluation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">{\u00b6 26} The trial court called appellant\u2019s aunt to the stand and asked her about appellant\u2019s competency. The aunt testified to the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">{\u00b6 27} \u201cI\u2019ve had her for more than just now. I\u2019ve had them the most of their lives so I pretty much know what \u2014 what they do and what they don\u2019t know. And \u2014 and she don\u2019t understand. It\u2019s just, I mean, if you \u2014 if you sit and explain something to her, it\u2019s just like they get a blank look on their face like they \u2014 it just goes like it\u2019s not comprehending through to them what you\u2019re trying to\u2014 tried saying it to them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">{\u00b6 28} The trial court then called appellant\u2019s father, who appeared not to remember appellant\u2019s schooling and disability, but did state that he had no problem communicating with her and that she understood the house rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">{\u00b6 29} The trial court then questioned appellant. The trial court asked the standard competency questions, whether she knew her attorney and what the attorney\u2019s role was, whether she knew what the judge was and what the judge\u2019s role was. Appellant did not know what a judge did, did not know what a witness was, and did not know the purpose of the adjudication hearing. Appellant knew she was in court accused of rape and understood \u201clater this month the Court will hear evidence as to whether or not you did what you were accused of.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b367-9\">{\u00b6 30} Although the trial court engaged in the standard \u201ccompetency\u201d dialogue seen in adult criminal court, it does not mitigate against the opinions of three people, defense counsel, the guardian ad litem, and appellant\u2019s aunt. All of these three people were in more intense contact with appellant than the trial court was during its cursory questioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-10\">{\u00b6 31} We concur with the trial court\u2019s analysis that this case is not an adult criminal proceeding. However, we find that the record as a whole substantiates the fact that a medical expert should have been ordered to render an opinion of competency sub judice.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-11\">{\u00b6 32} Assignments of Error I, II, and III are sustained. The matter is remanded to the trial court for the appointment of an expert to evaluate appellant\u2019s competency to participate in her own defense during the adjudicatory hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">{\u00b6 33} This assignment is rendered moot and the adjudication is reversed for a new trial pending the results of the competency evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">{\u00b6 34} The judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Licking County, Ohio, Juvenile Division is hereby reversed and remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b368-8\">Gwin, P.J., and Hoffman, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
