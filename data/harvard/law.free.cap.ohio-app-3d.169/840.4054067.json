At the same time, the trustees approved and adopted regulations applicable to the newly zoned Wedgewood Commerce Center. Those regulations, which are titled \u201cWedgewood Commerce Center Development Standards,\u201d were filed in February 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-10\">{\u00b6 3} The Wedgewood Commerce Center Development Standards divide the Planned Commercial District into 17 separate subareas within the Wedgewood Commerce Center. Each of the subareas is designated for a specific use, including, among others, \u201cSuburban Office,\u201d \u201cAttached Housing,\u201d and \u201cCommercial.\u201d Only Subareas 3, 8, and 9 are designated for commercial use.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-11\">{\u00b6 4} The \u201cSubarea Development Criteria\u201d for subarea 3 provides that the gross building area for that subarea is 220,857 square feet. In turn, the Subarea Development Criteria for subarea 8 states that the gross building area for that subarea is 144,553 square feet while the criteria for subarea 9 provides that the gross building area for that subarea is 134,520 square feet. Thus, the combined total gross commercial building area is 500,000 square feet. The Wedgewood Commerce Center Development Standards also require establishment of an architectural review committee.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-12\">{\u00b6 5} Following the adoption of the development plan for the Planned Commercial District, Liberty Township issued zoning certificates allowing commercial use in subareas that were designated for \u201csuburban office\u201d use rather than for commercial use.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-13\">{\u00b6 6} Subarea 3 of the Wedgewood Commerce Center, which was platted in 1994 as lot 2069 and comprises approximately 34 acres, has been owned by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>appellant Wedgewood Limited Partnership I since 1991. In October 2003, appellant submitted an application for certain variances from the Liberty Township Zoning Resolution in order to construct a Wal-Mart Super Center on lot 2069, but later withdrew its application.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-4\">{\u00b6 7} Thereafter, on January 19, 2004, the Liberty Township Board of Trustees issued a \u201cPublic Statement and Instructions to Zoning Department Regarding Future Administration of Wedgewood Commerce Center Development Plan\u201d to address the \u201csignificant controversy regarding proposed additional commercial development in the Wedgewood Commerce Commercial Center development and in Liberty Township, generally.\u201d In that document, the trustees interpreted the development plan as imposing a \u201cfloating\u201d maximum of 500,000 square feet of commercial development in the Wedgewood Commerce Center. In that document, the trustees further stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b874-5\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cExtensive review and analysis of the Wedgewood Commerce Center development plan, the minutes of the meetings which led to the approval of that plan, the policies that have been followed to date in administering that plan, and the discernable intent of all of the parties expressed during the conception and the process which led to the approval of the plan, has led us to conclude that the ultimately adopted plan imposed a \u2018floating\u2019 maximum of 500,000 sq. ft. of \u2018commercial\u2019 development in the Wedgwood Commerce Center. We have found evidence of the establishment of this limit in a number of different documents. Moreover, we have found no documents or proof through amendment processes which modified this \u2018overall\u2019 square footage cap, as best as we can conclude. 4*</p>\n<p id=\"b874-7\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cThe analysis reveals that the commercial development completed to date, and substantially through the approval process, has consumed most of the commercial square footages imposed by the development plan as an overall cap. The analysis also reveals that, on an acreage basis, commercial development to date has exceeded at least two of the acreage figures evidenced in the document which constitute the development plan, as amended.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-8\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cUnder these circumstances, we have determined that except for a few modest projects which have already completed the two-step \u2018major\u2019 administrative review process, all additional applicants seeking to construct retail or other arguable \u2018commercial\u2019 development in the Wedgewood Commerce will be required to seek approval as a \u2018major\u2019 plan of modification. In other words, we are instructing our zoning department to refrain from issuing zoning certificates for any additional commercial development in the Wedgewood Commerce Center, to issue such permits only after an approval through the \u2018two-step\u2019 major process has been completed. Each process will be considered to be an application to consume any remaining portion of the square footage limitation, or exceed that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>limitation, and as a modification to expand the acreage limitation which we believe has been met.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">{\u00b6 11} The Liberty Township Board of Trustees, in its public statement, further concluded that \u201cthe negotiated plan required an architectural review (design review) board and process which, in our view, has not been considered or operated as contemplated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b875-6\">{\u00b6 12} Thereafter, on June 29, 2004, appellant submitted two separate applications for zoning permits to Liberty Township. The first application was for the retail/grocery component of the proposed Wal-Mart Super Center and indicated that the building area was 220,598 square feet. The second application was for a Murphy Oil gas station at the proposed Wal-Mart site and indicated that the building area was 243 square feet.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-7\">{\u00b6 13} As memorialized in a letter dated September 30, 2004, the Liberty Township zoning inspector denied the two applications on four grounds. The zoning inspector specifically found that the development plan for Wedgewood Commerce Center \u201cremains incomplete, because at no time has this office received a revised Development Plan and Plat which in all respects conforms to the representations and commitments made at the meeting of the Liberty Township Board of Trustees which occurred on November 18, 1991, and at the hearings which preceded that final hearing.\u201d The zoning inspector further found that the proposed construction \u201cwould exceed the maximum allowable commercial acreage and square footage limitations that were expressly made a part of the development plan\u201d and that the applications did not \u201cinclude the required approval of the Wedgewood Commerce Architectural Review Committee.\u201d Finally, the zoning inspector found that the applications were \u201cincomplete, internally inconsistent, and at variance with the requirements of Resolution and the Wedgewood Commerce Development Plan in many different respects.\u201d The deficiencies in the plans were specifically enumerated in the zoning inspector\u2019s letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-8\">{\u00b6 14} In response, appellant, on October 20, 2004, hand-delivered a letter to the zoning inspector, dated October 20, 2004, from appellant\u2019s treasurer indicating that appellant was withdrawing that portion of its application relating to the Murphy Oil gas station. Appellant\u2019s treasurer, in that letter, referenced an attached letter from its engineering firm, CESO Engineers and Surveyors, which addressed the concerns that the zoning inspector had raised in her September 30, 2004 letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-9\">{\u00b6 15} On or about October 19, 2004, appellant filed a notice of appeal from the zoning inspector\u2019s September 30, 2004 decision with appellee Liberty Zoning Board of Zoning Appeals. Appellant, in its appeal, alleged that the zoning inspector was incorrect and had acted improperly in determining that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>development plan for Wedgewood Commerce Center was incomplete and in determining that the proposed construction would exceed the maximum square foot limitations. Appellant also alleged that the zoning inspector was incorrect in holding that a zoning certificate could not be issued because there was no approval by the architectural review board and in finding that the application was incomplete.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-5\">{\u00b6 16} A public hearing was held on November 16, 2004. On January 11, 2005, the Board of Zoning Appeals adopted a document titled \u201cFindings of Fact and Conclusions of Law\u201d that affirmed the decision of the zoning inspector.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-6\">{\u00b6 17} Subsequently, on February 8, 2005, appellant filed a notice of appeal from the Board of Zoning Appeals\u2019 decision with the Delaware County Court of Common Pleas pursuant to R.C. 2506.01. The record of the proceedings before the Liberty Township Board of Zoning Appeals was filed with the trial court on March 18, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-7\">{\u00b6 18} On March 28, 2005, appellant filed a motion seeking to supplement the record with additional evidence, arguing that the record did not contain all of the \u201ctownship\u2019s documents and other evidence that were relied upon by the township\u2019s zoning inspector and the [Board of Zoning Appeals] in denying the application for a zoning certificate.\u201d Appellant, in its motion, specifically alleged that the missing documents were the basis for the trustee\u2019s imposition of a \u201cfloating cap\u201d on commercial development and a \u201ctwo step\u201d approval process and both the zoning inspector\u2019s decision and the decision of the Board of Zoning Appeals affirming the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-8\">{\u00b6 19} Pursuant to a decision and entry filed on May 13, 2005, the trial court denied appellant\u2019s motion, finding that \u201cquestions and concerns regarding certain documents and procedures should have been addressed at the hearing below and because they were not, this Court is unable to permit the record to be supplemented.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b876-9\">{\u00b6 20} The parties filed briefs in the trial court and a hearing was held on July 18, 2005. At the hearing, the trial court stated, on the record, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b876-10\">{\u00b6 21} \u201cThe Court: Counsel, let me tell you where I\u2019m coming from so that you know what I really want you to address today. The two major issues as far as this court is concerned is one, what is the legal basis of the five hundred thousand square foot limit, and two, what are the facts as to whether or not the P.U.D. approved back in \u201992 expired or not.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b876-11\">{\u00b6 22} At the conclusion of the hearing, the trial court indicated on the record that it was thinking of remanding the matter to the Board of Zoning Appeals for additional evidence and asked the parties to file briefs addressing the issue of whether the trial court had the authority to do so. After briefs were filed by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>parties, the trial court, pursuant to a decision and entry filed on September 22, 2005, remanded the matter to the Liberty Township Board of Zoning Appeals. The trial court, in its decision and entry, stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b877-4\">{\u00b6 23} \u201cIn this case, vital information is missing from the Liberty Township Board of Zoning Appeals (\u2018BZA\u2019) record that was submitted to this Court. Scarce, if any, testimony or exhibits were contained within the record that resolved questions pertaining to the basis of the zoning inspector\u2019s decision to deny Wedgewood\u2019s application for a zoning certificate. Further, the record was also devoid of evidence as to the legal basis of the 500,000 square foot commercial limit imposed upon the WCC; and evidence as to the affect of the originally approved PUD plan for the WCC on the commercial limit. As such, it appears that the BZA decision may have been reached without consideration of these crucial questions. It also has been demonstrated that such evidence may have reasonably affected the BZA\u2019s decision. Accordingly, this Court must remand this matter to the BZA to carry out its role as the finder of fact to determine the basis of zoning inspector\u2019s decision, as well as provide documentation of the legal basis of the 500,000 square foot commercial limit on the Wedgewood Commerce Center Plan Development and the affect of the original Planned Unit Development Plan. Therefore, this case is hereby REMANDED to the Liberty Township Board of Zoning Appeals.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">{\u00b624} Appellant now appeals from the trial court\u2019s September 22, 2005 decision and entry, raising the following assignments of error on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b877-6\">{\u00b6 25} \u201cI. The court of common pleas erred by remanding this administrative appeal to the Board of Zoning Appeals in order to consider additional evidence and by not entering judgment in favor of plaintiff-appellant where the record before the BZA was complete on the issue of the nonexistence of a \u2018floating cap\u2019 on commercial development and, thus, remand is only an invitation to create evidence where none exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-7\">{\u00b6 26} \u201cII. The court of common pleas erred by remanding this administrative appeal to the Board of Zoning Appeals to consider additional evidence and by not entering judgment in favor of plaintiff-appellant where the township trustees\u2019 January 19, 2004 instructions, which announced the creation of a \u2018floating cap\u2019 on commercial development that the court of common pleas recognized served as the primary basis for denial of a zoning certificate to plaintiff-appellant, were an invalid legislative act and, thus, remand to consider further evidence on this matter is futile.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-8\">{\u00b6 27} \u201cHI. The court of common pleas erred by remanding this administrative appeal to the Board of Zoning Appeals and by not entering judgment in favor of plaintiff-appellant since the preponderance of the substantial, reliable, and probative evidence does not support the denial of a zoning certificate to plaintiff-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>appellant because plaintiff-appellant\u2019s application for a zoning certificate complied with all requirements of the development plan and the January 19, 2004 instructions issued by the township trustees are illegal, unconstitutional, and unenforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">{\u00b6 28} \u201cIV. The court of common pleas erred by remanding this administrative appeal to the Board of Zoning Appeals and by not entering judgment in favor of plaintiff-appellant since the January 19, 2004 instructions and denial of plaintiff-appellant\u2019s application for zoning certificate on the basis of those instructions violated plaintiff-appellant\u2019s right to due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-6\">{\u00b6 29} \u201cV. The court of common pleas erred by remanding this administrative appeal to the Board of Zoning Appeals and by not entering judgment in favor of plaintiff-appellant since the township is barred by equitable estoppel and laches from enforcing a \u2018floating cap\u2019 on commercial development that takes into account developments approved in subareas designated in the development plan for \u2018suburban office\u2019 use.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-7\">{\u00b6 30} \u201cVI. The court of common pleas erred by remanding this administrative appeal to the Board of Zoning Appeals and by not entering judgment in favor of plaintiff-appellant since the preponderance of the substantial, reliable, and probative evidence does not support the denial of a zoning certificate to plaintiff-appellant because: plaintiff-appellant\u2019s application for zoning certificate complied with all technical aspects of the zoning resolution; the development plan does not require the approval of an architectural review committee for a zoning certificate to be issued; plaintiff-appellant did not consent to commercial development in subareas designed in the development plan for \u2018suburban office\u2019 use; and no modification of the development plan is necessary for plaintiff-appellant to be entitled to a zoning certificate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b878-8\">{\u00b6 31} In turn, appellee raises the following assignment of error on cross-appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b878-9\">{\u00b6 32} \u201cI. The court of common pleas erred by remanding this administrative appeal to the Board of Zoning Appeals to consider additional evidence, and by not entering judgment in favor of defendant-appellees, where all of the evidence in the record demonstrates that as a matter of law the decisions of the township zoning inspector and the township Board of Zoning Appeals affirming the zoning inspector\u2019s decision were constitutional and lawful, and supported by all of the substantial, reliable, and probative evidence on the record as a whole.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b878-10\">{\u00b6 33} However, before addressing the merits of the assignments of error, we must first address whether the September 22, 2005 decision and entry of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>Delaware County Court of Common Pleas is a final, appealable order.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">{\u00b6 34} Ohio law provides that appellate courts have jurisdiction to review only final orders or judgments. See, generally, Section 3(B)(2), Article IV, Ohio Constitution; R.C. 2505.02. If an order is not final and appealable, then an appellate court has no jurisdiction to review the matter and it must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">{\u00b6 35} Revised Code 2505.02 states:</p>\n<p id=\"b879-7\">{\u00b6 36} \u201c(B) An order is a final order that may be reviewed, affirmed, modified, or reversed, with or without retrial, when it is one of the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b879-8\">{\u00b6 37} \u201c(1) An order that affects a substantial right in an action that in effect determines the action and prevents a judgment;</p>\n<p id=\"b879-9\">{\u00b6 38} \u201c(2) An order that affects a substantial right made in a special proceeding or upon a summary application in an action after judgement;</p>\n<p id=\"b879-10\">{\u00b6 39} \u201c(3) An order that vacates or sets aside a judgment or grants a new trial;</p>\n<p id=\"b879-11\">{\u00b6 40} \u201c(4) An order that grants or denies a provisional remedy and to which both of the following apply;</p>\n<p id=\"b879-12\">{\u00b6 41} \u201c(a) The order in effect determines the action with respect to the provisional remedy and prevents a judgment in the action in favor of the appealing party with respect to the provisional remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-13\">{\u00b6 42} \u201c(b) The appealing party would not be afforded a meaningful or effective remedy by an appeal following final judgment as to all proceedings, issues, claims, and parties in the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-14\">{\u00b6 43} \u201c(5) An order that determines that an action may or may not be maintained as a class action;</p>\n<p id=\"b879-15\">{\u00b6 44} \u201c(6) An order determining the constitutionality of any changes to the Revised Code made by Am. Sub. S.B. 281 of the 124th general assembly, including the amendment of sections 1751.67, 2117.06, 2305.11, 2305.15, 2305.234, 2317.02, 2317.54, 2323.56, 2711.21, 2711.22, 2711.23, 2711.24, 2743.02, 2743.43, 2919.16, 3923.63, 3923.64, 4705.15, and 5111.018, and the enactment of sections 2305.113, 2323.41, 2323.43, and 2323.55 of the Revised Code or any changes made by Sub. S.B. 80 of the 125th general assembly, including the amendment of sections 2125.02, 2305.10, 2305.131, 2315.18, 2315.19, and 2315.21 of the Revised Code.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b880-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>{\u00b6 45} In the case sub judiee, appellant specifically argues that the trial court\u2019s September 22, 2005 decision and entry is a final, appealable order pursuant to R.C. 2505.02(B)(2) and 2505.02(B)(3). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-4\">{\u00b6 46} As is stated above, R.C. 2505.02(B)(2) provides that an \u201corder that affects a substantial right made in a special proceeding\u201d is a final, appealable order. A \u201csubstantial right\u201d is defined as \u201ca right that the United States Constitution, the Ohio Constitution, a statute, the common law, or a rule of procedure entitles a person to enforce or protect.\u201d R.C. 2505.02(A)(1). An order that affects a substantial right is one that, if not immediately appealable, would foreclose appropriate relief in the future. <em>Neary v. Bd. of Zoning Appeals </em>(July 30, 1999), Montgomery App. No. 17428, 1999 WL 960777, at *4, citing <em>State v. Chalender </em>(1994), 99 Ohio App.3d 4, 6-7, 649 N.E.2d 1254.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">{\u00b6 47} We find that the order appealed from is not a final, appealable order since the trial court\u2019s September 22, 2005 decision and entry did not preclude the possibility that appellant\u2019s application for a zoning permit would be granted on remand. In <em>Neary, </em>supra, the appellant, after three of his permits for construction of a billboard were revoked and five other permits for construction of billboard signs were denied by a zoning inspector, filed an appeal with the Board of Zoning Appeals (\u201cBZA\u201d). The appellant, in his appeal, requested that if the zoning inspector\u2019s decision was upheld, he be granted variances for the eight proposed billboards. The BZA denied the appellant\u2019s applications for permits and refused his request for variances for them.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-6\">{\u00b6 48} The appellant in <em>Neary </em>then appealed to the Montgomery County Common Pleas Court pursuant to R.C. 2506.01. The appellant, in his brief to the trial court, asserted five assignments of error. The appellant argued that the BZA had acted in an arbitrary, capricious, and unreasonable manner by interpreting the zoning code as limiting billboards to no more than 50 square feet in size, that the code sections relevant to the BZA\u2019s decision were unconstitutional since they had the effect of banning all billboards within the city limits of Moraine, and that the zoning code contained an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority inasmuch as the BZA enjoyed unfettered discretion in determining whether to grant or deny variance requests. The appellant in <em>Neary </em>also argued that the code was being arbitrarily enforced and that the BZA should be equitably estopped from revoking the three previously granted permits.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-7\">{\u00b6 49} The common pleas court sustained Neary\u2019s first assignment of error and remanded the case to the BZA with instructions to \u201cdetermine what restrictions or limitations apply to Neary\u2019s billboards.\u201d The court further found that the appellant\u2019s second and fifth assignments of error were moot and overruled his third and fourth assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>{\u00b6 50} On remand in <em>Neary, </em>the BZA denied the appellant\u2019s request for permits and his requests for variances. The appellant then appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-4\">{\u00b6 51} The Second District Court of Appeals noted, as a preliminary matter, that it had to determine whether the trial court\u2019s decision following the appellant\u2019s first appeal to that tribunal constituted a final, appealable order. In holding that that decision was not a final, appealable order, the Second District Court of Appeals stated: \u201cSince the trial court\u2019s first decision did not preclude the possibility of Neary\u2019s applications being granted on remand, we cannot say his substantial right to use the land, if existent, was affected by the decision. Therefore, we conclude that the [sic] neither R.C. \u00a7 2505.02(B)(1) nor (2) provide a basis for finding the trial court\u2019s first decision to be a final appealable order.\u201d <em>Neary, </em>Montgomery App. No. 17428, 1999 WL 960777, at *4. For the same reason, we hold that the trial court\u2019s September 22, 2005 decision and entry was not a final, appealable order.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">{\u00b6 52} The next issue for determination is whether the trial court\u2019s September 22, 2005 decision and entry was a final, appealable order under R.C. 2505.02(B)(3). Appellant maintains that the trial court\u2019s remand order, in effect, grants a new trial and thus is a final order as defined in R.C. 2505.02(B)(3). However, we find that the trial court\u2019s order does not grant a trial de novo since the trial court had not reached the merits of the case and did not render its decision on the matter. Thus, the trial court retained jurisdiction over this matter. See <em>Eberhard Mfg. v. Santa </em>(July 19, 2001), Cuyahoga App. No. 78588, 2001 WL 824454. Accordingly, the trial court\u2019s September 22, 2005 decision and entry is not a final, appealable order pursuant to R.C. 2505.02(B)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b881-6\">{\u00b6 53} We further note that the similar issue of whether a court of common pleas order remanding a case for further hearing to the Board of Building Appeals was a final, appealable order was considered in <em>Shaker Towers Condominium v. Cleveland Fire Dept. </em>(2000), 135 Ohio App.3d 742, 735 N.E.2d 520. In that case, a condominium association appealed from a decision of the Board of Building Appeals that required it to install an elevator recall system. The trial court remanded the matter to the Ohio Board of Building Appeals for a hearing, finding that the record was incomplete. In holding that the trial court\u2019s order was not a final, appealable order, the Eighth District Court of Appeals stated: \u201cThe order set forth above clearly does not vacate or set aside the decision of the Ohio Board of Building Appeals. It does not determine the merits of the appeal; rather, it effectively requires the board to hold a new hearing in order to create a better record for appellate review. Even though the judge indicated that the order was final, that does not determine the finality of the order under R.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>2505.02. It is clear that the matter is still pending in her court subject to compliance with the judge\u2019s direction upon remand.\u201d Id. at 745, 735 N.E.2d 520.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">{\u00b6 54} Finally, while appellant cites numerous cases in support of its proposition that orders of remand to an administrative body in an administrative appeal under R.C. Chapter 2506 are final, appealable orders, we find that those cases are distinguishable from this case. In <em>Stace Dev., Inc. v. Wellington Twp. Bd. of Zoning Appeals, </em>Lorain App. No. 04CA008619, 2005-Ohio-4798, 2005 WL 2219618, for example, the appellant appealed the trial court\u2019s decision reversing the BZA\u2019s denial of a zoning variance and ordering the BZA to reconsider the variance petition filed by the appellee. In <em>Hensel v. Bd. of Zoning Appeals Lake Township, </em>Stark App. No. 2001-CA-00046, 2001-Ohio-1377, 2001 WL 1131058, which was decided by this court, the trial court reversed the decision of the Board of Zoning Appeals and remanded the matter to the BZA to consider whether or not to grant a variance. In <em>Perez v. City of Cleveland Bd. of Zoning Appeals </em>(Jan. 13, 2000), Cuyahoga App. No. 75166, 2000 WL 23123, the appellant City of Cleveland Board of Zoning Appeals appealed from a decision by the trial court reversing the BZA\u2019s denial of a request for a change of use permit and remanding the matter to the BZA. In all of the above cases, the trial court reversed a decision made by the BZA before remanding the matter to the BZA. In other words, the trial court made a decision on the merits. The trial court in this matter did not do so.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The trial court in this matter remanded the cause to the BZA for additional action. The trial court never made a decision on the assignments of error that were before it.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>{\u00b6 55} Based on the foregoing, we find that the September 22, 2005 decision and entry of the Delaware County Court of Common Pleas was not a final, appealable order.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-4\">{\u00b6 56} The appeal and cross-appeal are, therefore, dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b883-6\">Hoffman, P.J., and Boggins, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b879-16\">. Previously, this court, pursuant to a judgment entry filed on February 21, 2006, denied appellees' motion to dismiss for lack of a final, appealable order. However, that finding was subject to reconsideration. See, for example, <em>Tabbaa </em>v. <em>Koglman, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 83215, 2004-Ohio-2706, 2004 WL 1172307, and <em>Hayes </em>v. <em>White </em>(Dec. 3, 2001), Columbiana App. No. 01 CO 00, 2001 WL 1568866.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b882-6\">. {\u00b6 a} See, also, <em>Geisert v. Willoughby Zoning Bd. </em>(Sept. 30, 1993), Lake App. No. 93-L-020, 1993 WL 407240. In that case, the Willoughby Zoning Board revoked a conditional use permit and the appellant then appealed to the court of common pleas. The court of common pleas reversed the decision of the zoning board and remanded solely because the board had failed to make findings of fact and conclusions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-7\">{11b} In holding that the trial court\u2019s order was not a final appealable order, the court in <em>Geisert </em>stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b882-8\">{\u00b6 c} \"At this time, the trial court\u2019s order does not address the merits of whether the conditional user permit should or should not be revoked.
