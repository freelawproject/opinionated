McMonagle, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b634-12\">{\u00b6 1} Defendant-appellant, John P. Welms, appeals his assault conviction. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-13\">{\u00b6 2} Plaintiff-appellee, the city of Cleveland, filed a complaint against appellant, charging him with one count of assault, a misdemeanor of the first degree in violation of Cleveland Codified Ordinances 621.03. Appellant waived his right to a jury trial. After a bench trial, the court found appellant guilty. He was sentenced to two years of community control and ordered to pay restitution for the complaining witness\u2019s medical treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-14\">{\u00b6 3} The events that gave rise to the charge occurred at Cloud 9, a nightclub in the city of Cleveland. At trial, two witnesses testified on behalf of the city. Stacey Rossi, a bartender at Cloud 9, testified that she was sitting in the club having cocktails<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> when she observed appellant and the complaining witness, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>Kenneth Stock, arguing. Rossi testified that she observed appellant punch Stock in the face. Rossi described Stock as trying to get up after appellant had hit him, but falling down. According to Rossi, a crowd congregated around Stock, who was on the floor, with some of the members of the crowd on top of him. Rossi \u201cassumed\u201d that appellant was one of the people on top of Stock; she did not actually observe that.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">{\u00b6 4} Rossi also testified that after the altercation, Stock\u2019s eye was swollen and he had a \u201cbig lump on his head.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">{\u00b6 5} The second witness for the city was Stock. Stock testified that he was at the club and observed appellant. Stock and appellant had previously been introduced to each other by a mutual acquaintance and had an unresolved \u201cmisunderstanding.\u201d Stock testified that in hopes of resolving their misunderstanding, he approached appellant. Stock and appellant began to argue, however, and appellant pushed Stock, sending him \u201cflying backwards.\u201d Stock explained that once he got up, he approached appellant with a clenched fist. Stock testified that appellant hit him, causing Stock to fall to the ground. While on the ground, Stock felt people kicking and hitting him. Stock testified that appellant was on top of him, and when the altercation was broken up by the club\u2019s bouncers, appellant was one of the people the bouncers removed from on top of him.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">{\u00b6 6} Stock testified that after the altercation, he left Cloud 9 and went to a friend\u2019s house. Stock explained that the following day he went to the hospital because he could not open his mouth and had blurred vision and a bad headache. Stock testified that he was diagnosed with a fractured jaw. Stock also testified that he returned to the hospital because he needed stronger pain medication in order to eat. Six photographs depicting Stock\u2019s injuries were admitted into evidence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">{\u00b6 7} Stock denied threatening appellant. Stock also denied throwing a glass at appellant, as appellant and two witnesses claimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-9\">{\u00b6 8} At the conclusion of the city\u2019s case, the defense made a Crim.R. 29 motion for acquittal, which was denied. The defense then presented witnesses on its behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-10\">{\u00b6 9} The first defense witness, Paulo Formichelli, went to Cloud 9 with appellant. Formichelli testified that on a prior occasion, appellant had him listen to voicemail messages left by Stock for appellant. Formichelli described Stock\u2019s tone in the voicemail messages as angry.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-11\">{\u00b6 10} Formichelli testified that upon arriving at Cloud 9, he went to another part of the club from where appellant was and did not observe the altercation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>between appellant and Stock. Formichelli went back to the portion of the club where appellant was after the altercation had ended and observed employees of the club sweeping up glass. Formichelli was unaware of how the glass was broken, though.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">{\u00b6 11} The second defense witness, Anthony DeBaltzo, described Stock approaching appellant and being \u201caggressive, in his face},]\u201d and \u201cpushing, pointing at him.\u201d In particular, DeBaltzo described Stock as pushing his finger into appellant\u2019s chest. DeBaltzo testified that appellant pushed Stock back \u201cto get him out of his space},]\u201d and that Stock then threw a glass aimed in appellant\u2019s direction. After throwing the glass, Stock \u201ccharged\u201d appellant, and appellant punched Stock, causing Stock to fall back. DeBaltzo testified that no one was on top of Stock. Later that evening, DeBaltzo saw Stock at another club.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">{\u00b6 12} Eric Loomis was the third defense witness. Loomis testified that he observed appellant and Stock exchange words, and saw Stock \u201c[get] in [appellant\u2019s] face.\u201d Loomis testified to the following sequence of events: appellant pushed Stock away; Stock threw a glass, hitting a wall; Stock charged appellant; and appellant hit Stock, who fell to the ground. Loomis testified that Stock \u201cgot up real quick\u201d and no one was on the floor with him. Loomis testified that he also saw Stock later in the evening at the same club where DeBaltzo testified to seeing him.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">{\u00b6 13} Appellant was the final witness for the defense\u2019s case. Appellant testified that Stock approached him in Cloud 9 and wanted to talk to him about their misunderstanding. Appellant testified that while Stock was talking to him, Stock became enraged, and swore and poked at him. Appellant testified that he then pushed Stock, who fell down. Appellant testified that he screamed to Stock to \u201c[s]tay the T away from me.\u201d Stock then picked up a glass and threw it at appellant and ran after him. Appellant punched Stock in the face, because, as he explained, Stock was \u201c[r]unning at me, coming after he threw the rock glass at me. He wasn\u2019t coming to shake my hand.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">{\u00b6 14} Appellant\u2019s sole assignment of error is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cThe trial court erred in finding the appellant guilty of assault because the conviction was against the manifest weight of the evidence as appellant proved by a preponderance of evidence that appellant was acting in self-defense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b636-9\">{\u00b6 16} In a bench trial, the trial court assumes the fact-finding function of the jury. Accordingly, to warrant reversal from a bench trial under a manifest weight of the evidence claim, this court must review the entire record, weigh the evidence and all reasonable inferences, consider the credibility of witnesses and determine whether in resolving conflicts in evidence, the trial court clearly lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the judgment must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>be reversed and a new trial ordered. <em>State v. Thompkins </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 387, 678 N.E.2d 541; <em>Brooklyn v. Nova, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 83550, 2004-Ohio-3610, 2004 WL 1532201.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">{\u00b6 17} Cleveland Codified Ordinances 621.03 governs assault and provides as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">{\u00b6 18} \u201c(a) No person shall knowingly cause or attempt to cause physical harm to another.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">{\u00b6 19} To prevail on a nondeadly-force affirmative defense, one must show by a preponderance of the evidence that (1) he was not at fault in creating the situation, (2) he reasonably believed that some force was necessary to defend himself against the imminent use of unlawful force, and (3) the force used was not likely to cause death or great bodily harm. <em>Columbus v. Dawson </em>(1986), 33 Ohio App.3d 141, 142, 514 N.E.2d 908. Under Ohio law, there is no duty to retreat, even if it is possible to do so, before using nondeadly force in self-defense. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-8\">{\u00b6 20} In his assignment of error, appellant argues that the trial court \u201ccompletely ignored the evidence of the affirmative defense of self defense and gave great weight to the flawed testimony of the alleged victim.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-9\">{\u00b6 21} The record in this case supports a finding that appellant was at fault for creating the altercation between himself and Stock. Stock testified that the initial physical contact between him and appellant occurred when appellant pushed him. Loomis, who testified for the defense, described the initial physical contact between appellant and Stock as occurring when appellant pushed Stock away after Stock \u201cgot in [appellant\u2019s] face.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b637-10\">{\u00b6 22} DeBaltzo, who testified for the defense, described Stock as pointing and pushing his finger into appellant\u2019s chest, and appellant then pushing Stock back \u201cto get him out of his space.\u201d Stock also described appellant as poking at him.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-11\">{\u00b6 23} Thus, out of the four witnesses who testified to the initial moments of the altercation,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> two described Stock poking appellant, and two described the initial physical contact between appellant and Stock as occurring when appellant pushed Stock. Based on that testimony, the trier of fact could have reasonably concluded that the physical altercation resulted from appellant pushing Stock to the ground. Moreover, the trial court could have reasonably concluded that Stock\u2019s poking appellant did not constitute an attack on appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>{\u00b6 24} Thus, upon review of the record, we cannot conclude that the trial court clearly lost its way and created a manifest miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">{\u00b6 25} Moreover, our view is not changed by the inconsistencies (whether the club was crowded and whether Stock threw a glass in appellant\u2019s direction) in the witnesses\u2019 testimonies. Whether the club was crowded is irrelevant in this case. Further, regardless of whether the testimony relative to Stock throwing a glass was believed or disbelieved, it does not change the fact, as admitted by appellant, that prior to the alleged glass-throwing incident, appellant pushed Stock with enough force to knock him to the ground. As previously discussed, appellant\u2019s action in pushing Stock to the ground could reasonably support the conclusion that appellant was the aggressor.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">(\u00b6 26} We also find appellant\u2019s argument that the trial court gave too much weight to Rossi\u2019s testimony unpersuasive. Appellant argues that \u201c[Rossi\u2019s] judgment was impaired by alcohol\u201d and, thus, she was only able to \u201cassume\u201d facts. In regard to the effect of Rossi\u2019s alcohol consumption, there is no evidence in the record to indicate that Rossi was intoxicated. When \u00c9ossi was asked if she was drunk, she responded \u201cno.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">{\u00b6 27} In regard to the assumption made by Rossi (i.e., that appellant must have been in the group who Rossi testified was piled on top of Stock), it is important to note that this was a bench, not a jury, trial. We review a judge\u2019s decision on whether to admit evidence for abuse of discretion, <em>McClintock v. Fluellen, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 82795, 2004-Ohio-58, 2004 WL 35782, at \u00b6 26, and we give further deference to a judge\u2019s decision when the evidence is introduced in a bench trial. <em>State v. Fautenberry </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 435, 439, 650 N.E.2d 878. Unless the record indicates otherwise, the judge is presumed to have considered only admissible evidence. Id. There is no indication from this record that the trial judge considered Rossi\u2019s assumption. Moreover, the piling on top of Stock occurred, if at all, at the conclusion of the fray, after appellant had pushed and punched Stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-8\">{\u00b6 28} Appellant\u2019s final argument relates to the lack of medical evidence at trial. The city did not introduce Stock\u2019s medical record from his treatment into evidence, as the city did not have a certified copy of it. There was testimony at trial, however, regarding Stock\u2019s injuries. In particular, Rossi testified that after the altercation, Stock\u2019s eye was swollen and he had a \u201cbig lump on his head.\u201d Stock also testified that the following day he went to the hospital because he could not open his mouth and had blurred vision and a bad headache. Stock testified that he was diagnosed with a fractured jaw. Further, Stock explained that he returned to the hospital to obtain stronger pain medication because he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>was having difficulty eating. This testimony was sufficient to demonstrate that Stock suffered physical harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">{\u00b6 29} In regard to the court\u2019s order of restitution based upon Stock\u2019s injuries, we first note that appellant has failed to make the sentencing hearing, at which restitution was ordered, part of the record for our review. Thus, we are unable to determine whether appellant objected to the specific amount and must presume the regularity of the proceeding. See <em>Knapp v. Edwards Laboratories </em>(1980), 61 Ohio St.2d 197, 199, 15 O.O.3d 218, 400 N.E.2d 384.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">{\u00b6 30} We are able to determine from a review of the record, though, that appellant\u2019s attorney, prior to sentencing, \u201crequested motion to provide itemized bills/invoices of all medical records pertaining to injuries from the assault.\u201d Appellant\u2019s counsel further represented that \u201ca stipulation regarding the amount of restitution will be available for the date of sentencing.\u201d We are also able to determine that in ordering restitution, the court considered the medical records from Fairview Health System relative to Stock\u2019s injuries. Thus, to the extent that appellant\u2019s argument is that the court erred by ordering restitution, appellant waived that argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">{\u00b6 31} Based upon the aforementioned, appellant\u2019s assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b639-9\">Corrigan, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b639-10\">Gallagher, P.J., dissents.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b639-11\">Michael J. Corrigan, J., retired, of the Eighth District Court of Appeals, sitting by assignment.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b634-15\">. Rossi explained that she was scheduled to work, but never worked that evening because, as was the club's practice, employees were not always required to work if it was not busy and the club had the necessary coverage.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b635-12\">. The photographs, however, were not made a part of the record for our review.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b637-12\">. Rossi testified that she initially \u201cwasn't really paying too much attention because * * * people do that [get in arguments] all the time at clubs.\u201d Formichelli testified that he was in another portion of the club when the altercation occurred and did not observe any of it.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b639-12\">Sean C. Gallagher, Presiding Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Ag2\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-13\">{\u00b6 32} I respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s conclusion that appellant was at fault in creating the situation. Under Ohio law, in order for a defendant to establish self-defense involving the use of nondeadly force, he must prove by a <em>preponderance </em>of the evidence (1) that the defendant was not at fault in <em>creating the situation giving rise to the altercation </em>and (2) that he had reasonable grounds to believe and an honest belief, even though mistaken, that he was in imminent danger of bodily harm and that his only means to protect himself from such danger was by the use of force not likely to cause death or great bodily harm. See 4 Ohio Jury Instructions (2000), Section 411.33; <em>State v. Fritz, </em>163 Ohio App.3d 276, 2005-Ohio-4736, 837 N.E.2d 823. There is no duty to retreat when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>nondeadly force is employed. <em>State v. Marbury, </em>Montgomery App. No. 19226, 2004-Ohio-1817, 2004 WL 758404.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">{\u00b6 33} I would not interpret the law on self-defense as narrowly as does the majority and the trial court. I believe that appellant established by a preponderance of the evidence that Stock, and not appellant, was at fault in <em>creating the situation </em>that gave rise to the altercation. DeBaltzo, Loomis, and appellant testified that Stock approached appellant and was aggressive and \u201cin his face.\u201d Stock himself corroborated the fact that <em>he </em>approached the appellant and they started to argue. Rossi, a witness for the city, also testified that the two were arguing. Stock created the situation that gave rise to the altercation.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">{\u00b6 34} I would reverse the appellant\u2019s conviction as being against the manifest weight of the evidence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
