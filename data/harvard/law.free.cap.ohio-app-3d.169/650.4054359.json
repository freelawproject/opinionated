In his cross-appeal, Gumm challenges the denial of the balance of his postconviction claims. We affirm the court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-10\">{\u00b6 2} In 1992, Gumm was convicted of aggravated murder and was sentenced to death. In 2002, the United States Supreme Court ruled in <em>Atkins v. </em>Virginia<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that executing a mentally retarded person violates the proscription against cruel and unusual punishment contained in the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution. In December of that year, the Ohio Supreme Court in <em>State v. </em>Lott<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> established procedures and substantive standards for adjudicating a capital defendant\u2019s <em>Atkins </em>claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-11\">{\u00b6 3} The court in <em>Lott </em>recognized that a defendant who had been sentenced to death before the <em>Lott </em>decision had not been afforded a full and fair opportunity to litigate his claim of mental retardation as a complete bar to his death sentence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court provided that opportunity by exempting that defendant from the time strictures of R.C. 2953.21 and the jurisdictional requirements of R.C. 2953.23, and by affording him 180 days from the date of its decision to present his <em>Atkins </em>claim in a postconviction petition.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b685-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>{\u00b6 4} In April 2003, Gumm presented his <em>Atkins </em>claim in a postconviction petition. He also presented in his petition claims seeking relief from his conviction on an array of non <em>-Atkins </em>grounds. Following a hearing, the common pleas court granted Gumm\u2019s <em>Atkins </em>claim, but denied the balance of his claims. These appeals followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-4\">\n<em>I. Gumm\u2019s Atkins Claim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">{\u00b6 5} The state presents on appeal a single assignment of error challenging the common pleas court\u2019s determination that Gumm is mentally retarded. This challenge is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">\n<em>A. The Mental-Retardation Hearing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">{\u00b6 6} At the hearing on his <em>Atkins </em>claim, Gumm presented testimony by two of his sisters, two of his junior high school teachers, and a court-appointed psychologist. His sisters testified that Gumm, during his childhood and adolescence, had been largely neglected by his alcoholic parents. He could neither read nor write, and he would communicate in grunts rather than words. He could not or would not attend to his personal hygiene, and he did not learn to tie his shoes until he was a teenager. His school attendance was sporadic, as he bounced from home to home to institution. He started drinking as a teenager, and alcohol remained a problem for him. He never established his own home, never had a steady job, never obtained a driver\u2019s license, and never used public transportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-8\">{\u00b6 7} On intelligence-quotient (\u201cIQ\u201d) tests administered between 1974 and 1979, Gumm received full-scale scores of 73, 70, and 71. In 1980 and 1981, when Gumm was 15 and 16 years old and living in an orphanage, his junior high school placed him for eighth and ninth grade in a class for students deemed \u201ceducable mentally handicapped\u201d and \u201ceducable mentally retarded.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b685-9\">{\u00b6 8} Two of the special-education teachers assigned to the class testified at Gumm\u2019s <em>Atkins </em>hearing. The teachers portrayed Gumm as a low-functioning student who was memorable because of his \u201cunke[m]pt\u201d appearance and \u201clost\u201d demeanor. An IQ test administered in 1981 yielded a full-scale score of 79. That and other testing showed that Gumm functioned during those years on a second-to-third-grade educational level. Gumm\u2019s teachers found that Gumm could read \u201ca little\u201d and could do simple arithmetic. He could follow simple directions and was able to assist the school\u2019s custodians with menial tasks in the cafeteria. He was polite to and cooperative with his teachers and classmates. But his affect was \u201cdull,\u201d and his behavior was that of a \u201cloner\u201d and a \u201cfollower.\u201d And he possessed fewer social skills than his classmates and exhibited notably poor personal hygiene. Based on the deficiencies in his adaptive skills, his under-80 IQ score, and the adverse effects of his intellectual and adaptive deficiencies on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>his educational performance, the school classified Gumm as \u201ceducable mentally retarded.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">{\u00b6 9} A court-appointed psychologist, Dr. David Alan Ott, qualified by the trial court as a mental-retardation expert, applied similar criteria to conclude that Gumm was mentally retarded. The Ohio Supreme Court in <em>State v. Lott </em>provided three criteria for evaluating a capital defendant\u2019s claim that he is, in the words of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Atkins, </em>\u201cso impaired as to fall within the range of mentally retarded offenders [against] who[se] [execution] there [has emerged] a national consensus.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The defendant must demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence (1) that he suffers from \u201csignificantly subaverage intellectual functioning,\u201d (2) that he has experienced \u201csignificant limitations in two or more adaptive skills, such as communication, self-care, and self-direction,\u201d and (3) that these manifestations of mental retardation appeared before the age of 18.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">{\u00b6 10} The court in <em>Lott </em>formulated its mental-retardation criteria based upon the clinical definitions of mental retardation provided in 1992 by the American Association of Mental Retardation (\u201cAAMR\u201d) and in 2002 by the American Psychiatric Association (\u201cAPA\u201d) and cited with approval by the Supreme Court in <em>Atkins.</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Both definitions provided these diagnostic criteria for mental retardation: substantial limitations in present functioning, manifested before the age of 18, and characterized by significantly subaverage intellectual functioning coexisting with significant limitations in two of the adaptive skills of communication, self-care, home living, social/interpersonal skills, use of community resources, self-direction, health and safety, functional academics, leisure, and work.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">{\u00b6 11} In 2002, the AAMR amended its definition to require a finding of significant deficiencies in one of three categories of adaptive skills: \u201cconceptual,\u201d which includes language, money concepts, self-direction, and the functional academic skills of reading and writing; \u201csocial,\u201d which includes interpersonal relationships, self-esteem, gullibility, naivete, and avoiding victimization; and \u201cpractical,\u201d which includes work, self-care, health, and safety skills. The AAMR also added in 2002 five assumptions that an examiner must take into account in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>diagnosing mental retardation, including the assumption that a mentally retarded person\u2019s strengths often coexist with his limitations and the assumption that a mentally retarded person may improve his functioning level with an appropriate system of supports.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b687-4\">{\u00b6 12} Dr. Ott reviewed the legal standard for mental retardation provided in <em>Atkins </em>and <em>Lott </em>and the psychological standards provided in 2000 by the APA and in 2002 by the AAMR. He reviewed Gumm\u2019s records, conducted a two-and-one-half-hour interview with Gumm, and interviewed Gumm\u2019s sisters, a brother, and his two special-education teachers. His examination led him to the opinion that Gumm was \u201cpresently mentally retarded.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">{\u00b6 13} Dr. Ott addressed first the adaptive-skills criterion. He found that Gumm had significant deficits in two \u2014 the conceptual and the practical \u2014 AAMR adaptive-skills categories and in nine of the eleven APA adaptive skills. He noted, for example, that the records of the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Corrections (\u201cDRC\u201d) indicated that Gumm could not read or write and was functionally illiterate. He found that these deficits in functional academics had first been identified when Gumm was six years old and that they had persisted through his adolescence and his 15 years on death row. Dr. Ott assigned little significance to Gumm\u2019s submission, during his imprisonment, of \u201ckites,\u201d or written inquiries addressed to prison personnel. He stated that the variety of handwriting on the kites had confirmed to him what the DRC records had noted: that Gumm had relied on staff and fellow inmates to write them for him.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">{\u00b6 14} Dr. Ott also found the record replete with notations concerning Gumm\u2019s poor personal hygiene, from early in his school career- through his 1992 trial. Dr. Ott\u2019s examination of Gumm for his mental-retardation hearing confirmed that the deficits in Gumm\u2019s self-care skills had persisted.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">{\u00b6 15} Dr. Ott then addressed the intellectual-functioning criterion. On IQ tests administered to Gumm before the age of 18, he scored 73, 70, 71, and 79. On IQ tests administered in 1992, right before his trial, and in 1994, Gumm received full-scale scores of 70, 67, and 61.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-8\">{\u00b6 16} For purposes of his examination, Dr. Ott disregarded two of Gumm\u2019s later scores, because they had been achieved in a group test. He also found the 79 scored in 1981 to be \u201cproblematic,\u201d coming as it did a mere two years after the 70 scored in 1978 and the 71 scored in 1979. Dr. Ott stated that he had elected not to test Gumm\u2019s IQ to aid him in his analysis, because his understanding of \u201cthe stability of IQ over time[,] and particularly once one reaches adolescence,\u201d led him to expect no dramatic improvement over the intervening years; because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>a test administered in a restrictive setting like a prison would give an invalid view of an individual\u2019s functioning; and because testing conducted after the age of 18 and under Gumm\u2019s circumstances would be open to questions concerning Gumm\u2019s motivation to do his best. He insisted that historical records and the consistency of those records over time were much more useful to his analysis than the results of a test conducted currently.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">{\u00b6 17} The court in <em>Lott </em>cautioned that an IQ test score is merely one measure of intellectual functioning that \u201calone [is] not sufficient to make a final determination on [the mental-retardation] issue.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Nevertheless, the court declared that a full-scale IQ score above 70 gives rise to \u201ca rebuttable presumption that a defendant [is] not mentally retarded.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Dr. Ott acknowledged the presumption, but criticized it as \u201cinconsistent with the state of the science in terms of AAMR and APA\u2019s definition^].\u201d The APA defines the term \u201cmild mental retardation\u201d as one \u201ctypically used to describe people with an IQ level of 50-55 to <em>approximately </em>70.\u201d <footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Dr. Ott testified that the AAMR and the APA require that IQ scores be subjected to a standard error of measurement of plus or minus three to five points. Thus, he asserted, the AAMR and the APA permitted a finding of subaverage intellectual functioning in a person with an IQ score of 73. Dr. Ott concluded that Gumm\u2019s IQ test scores from age eight to age 26 were, with the exception of the 1981 score, \u201cvery consistent * * * within the same range\u201d and \u201cconsistent with mental retardation when one takes into account the standard error of measurement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">{\u00b6 18} Dr. Ott acknowledged that Gumm\u2019s academic deficits had likely been affected by his hearing problem, his unstructured and unsupervised childhood, his school and home environments, and his alcohol abuse. He also considered the APA assumption that a mentally retarded person given an appropriate system of supports could improve his functioning to the point where he is no longer mentally retarded. He acknowledged that Gumm, while in prison, had posed few discipline problems and had maintained a menial job. But he noted that Gumm\u2019s deficits had preceded his alcohol abuse. And he concluded that, given the \u201cbreadth\u201d of Gumm\u2019s deficits, such improvement was unlikely.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">{\u00b6 19} Dr. Ott did not interview prison personnel. He noted that the AAMR requires an examiner to consider an individual\u2019s functioning in a community setting. And he asserted that the experience of prison personnel with Gumm in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>such a restrictive setting would not have allowed them to extrapolate to provide an accurate view of how Gumm would function in a community setting.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-4\">{\u00b6 20} The state did not produce at the hearing an expert to counter Dr. Ott\u2019s expert opinion that Gumm was mentally retarded. It instead presented the testimony of two lay witnesses \u2014 a death-row case manager and a death-row corrections officer \u2014 in an attempt to show that Gumm presently demonstrated no significant limitations in his adaptive skills.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">{\u00b6 21} The witnesses testified that Gumm interacted well and communicated effectively with others. They noted that he had submitted kites and commissary slips and that he had, until the decision in <em>Atkins, </em>attended GED classes. But they acknowledged that the kites bore different handwriting. And they conceded that they did not know who had written the kites or slips, whether Gumm could read or write, or whether he knew how much money he had in his commissary account. And the case worker acknowledged that prison records reflected that, throughout his time in prison, Gumm had continued to be a follower, had continued to manifest \u201cmental deficiencies,\u201d and had remained illiterate and thus dependent on the prison staff and fellow inmates for help with his correspondence.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">{\u00b6 22} The witnesses testified that during the recreation hour each day (the one hour when he was not confined to his cell), Gumm watched television or played cards. When he gambled at cards, the witnesses asserted, Gumm knew whether he was winning or losing. At the close of the recreation hour, it was Gumm\u2019s job, as the \u201crecreation porter,\u201d to straighten the recreation cage. Although the witnesses had heard no complaints, neither could testify about how well Gumm had performed his job.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">{\u00b6 23} The witnesses also stated that Gumm fed, showered, and dressed himself, kept his cell clean, attended \u201cnurse sick call\u201d when necessary, followed the rules, and was mindful of his safety and the safety of others. But they admitted that Gumm\u2019s failure to attend to these matters could result in punishment. And the case worker acknowledged that prison records showed that upon his intake in 1992, Gumm had required close supervision for his and others\u2019 safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-8\">B. <em>The Common Pleas Court\u2019s Decision</em></p>\n<p id=\"b689-9\">{\u00b6 24} Based upon the evidence adduced at the hearing, the common pleas court concluded that Gumm had sustained his burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that he is mentally retarded. The court determined that Gumm\u2019s IQ scores raised the presumption that he was not mentally retarded. But the court found that Gumm had rebutted the presumption with evidence demonstrating significantly subaverage intellectual functioning and significant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>limitations in his social, self-direction, and functional-academics adaptive skills manifested before the age of 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">{\u00b6 25} The determination of whether a capital defendant is, by the <em>Lott </em>court\u2019s definition, mentally retarded presents a factual issue for the trial court.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> And an appellate court may not reverse the trial court\u2019s determination if it was supported by reliable, credible evidence.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">{\u00b6 26} The court below declared the testimony of Gumm\u2019s two sisters to be less than credible. But the testimony by Gumm\u2019s junior high school teachers that Gumm, in eighth and ninth grade, had functioned on a second- or third-grade level provided ample evidence to support the common pleas court\u2019s conclusion that Gumm had, before the age of 18, manifested significantly subaverage intellectual functioning. And Dr. Ott\u2019s testimony to Gumm\u2019s literacy deficiencies, which the state\u2019s witnesses could not effectively counter, supported a finding that those deficiencies had persisted.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">{\u00b6 27} The record is also replete with evidence that Gumm, throughout his life, has experienced significant limitations in the adaptive skills of functional academics, social/interpersonal relationships, self-direction, and self-care. Again, Gumm\u2019s teachers and Dr. Ott provided proof of functional illiteracy that the state\u2019s witnesses could not controvert. And the testimony of the teachers and Dr. Ott, along with the DRC\u2019s records, demonstrated that Gumm had been and had remained a follower with limited social skills and deficits in his personal hygiene.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-7\">{\u00b6 28} The record thus provided reliable, credible, and <em>unrebutted </em>evidence to support the common pleas court\u2019s conclusion that Gumm was mentally retarded. Although the dissent emphasizes that there was evidence that would support a finding that Gumm is not mentally retarded, it is not an appellate court\u2019s function to substitute its judgment for that of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-8\">{\u00b6 29} We therefore conclude that the court properly granted Gumm\u2019s first postconviction claim. Accordingly, we overrule the state\u2019s assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-9\">\n<em>II. Gumm\u2019s Non-Atkins Claims</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b690-10\">{\u00b6 30} In his cross-appeal, Gumm advances six assignments of error. We find no merit to any aspect of the challenges presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>\n<em>A. Appellee\u2019s \u201cAssignment of Error\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b691-4\">{\u00b6 31} In his first assignment of error, Gumm asserts that credible, reliable evidence supported the common pleas court\u2019s determination that he is mentally-retarded. Because the court granted Gumm the relief sought in his <em>Atkins </em>claim, we view Gumm\u2019s first assignment of error as one offered under R.C. 2505.22, in his capacity as the appellee, to prevent a reversal of the court\u2019s judgment on this claim. And because we here affirm that aspect of the court\u2019s judgment, we need not address the assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">\n<em>B. Involuntary Confession and Ineffective Counsel</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">{\u00b6 32} In his remaining assignments of error, Gumm challenges the denial of his third, fifth, eighth, and ninth postconviction claims. In his third, eighth, and ninth claims, he sought relief from his judgment of conviction on the grounds that his confession had been involuntary because he is mentally retarded and because his counsel had been ineffective in preparing for and presenting his defense during the guilt and penalty phases of his trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">{\u00b6 33} Gumm was convicted in 1992. The General Assembly amended R.C. 2953.21(A)(2), effective September 21, 1995, to impose time limitations on the filing of a postconviction petition. The amendment afforded a postconviction petitioner who had been convicted before the amendment\u2019s effective date a period of one year from the effective date to file his petition.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Gumm timely filed his first postconviction petition in 1996. And his 2003 <em>Atkins </em>claim was, under the decision in <em>Lott, </em>timely filed. But he filed his non <em>-Atkins </em>postconviction claims well after the time prescribed by R.C. 2953.21.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-8\">{\u00b6 34} R.C. 2953.23 closely circumscribes the circumstances under which a common pleas court may entertain a tardy postconviction claim. The petitioner must show either that he was unavoidably prevented from discovering the facts upon which his claim depends, or that his claim is predicated upon a new or retrospectively applicable federal or state right recognized by the United States Supreme Court since the time prescribed by R.C. 2953.21 expired. And he must show by clear and convincing evidence that, but for constitutional error at trial, no reasonable factfinder would have found him guilty of the offense of which he was convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-9\">{\u00b6 35} Gumm\u2019s third, eighth, and ninth postconviction claims challenged the voluntary nature of his confession and his trial counsel\u2019s effectiveness. As to these claims, the record does not demonstrate that Gumm was unavoidably prevented from discovering the facts underlying the claims. Nor does it show <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>that the claims were based upon a new or retrospectively applicable federal or state right recognized by the United States Supreme Court since the time for filing his petition expired. We therefore conclude that the court below properly declined to entertain his third, eighth, and ninth claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">\n<em>C. Undisclosed Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">{\u00b6 36} In his fifth claim, Gumm sought relief from his conviction on the ground that the state had failed to disclose exculpatory evidence in the form of information developed by the police during their investigation. In support of his claim, he asserted that this evidence had been in the hands of the state, and that it had come to light only in the course of discovery conducted in preparing his <em>Atkins </em>claim. Thus, Gumm may fairly be said to have been unavoidably prevented from discovering the facts underlying his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">{\u00b6 37} The fair-trial guarantee of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution requires the state to disclose to a criminal accused evidence material to the accused\u2019s guilt or innocence.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Such evidence is \u201cmaterial\u201d only if there is a \u201creasonable probability\u201d that its disclosure would have changed the outcome of the trial.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The determination of whether such a probability exists entails an inquiry not into whether a trial with the undisclosed evidence would have yielded a different verdict, but into whether the evidence, \u201cconsidered collectively,\u201d \u201ccould reasonably be taken to put the whole case in such a different light as to undermine confidence in the verdict.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b692-8\">{\u00b6 38} Gumm was convicted of aggravated murder, attempted rape, and kidnapping in connection with the fatal beating of a ten-year-old boy in an abandoned building. The investigating officers testified at trial that in the weeks following the murder, they had had little physical evidence on which to proceed, and their list of potential witnesses and suspects had consisted of approximately 145 people. They turned their attention to Gumm after his sister had reported that Gumm knew his way around the abandoned building where the victim had been found and that he had been in the vicinity of the building on the day of the murder. Gumm subsequently confessed that he had participated in the murder. And the defense, at the hearing on Gumm\u2019s motion to suppress, failed to convince the trial court that his confession was involuntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>{\u00b6 39} In support of his fifth claim, Gumm offered Crimestopper reports, lead and tip sheets, and investigation notes and summaries memorializing information received and gathered by the police during their investigation. These records showed what the investigating officers stated at Gumm\u2019s trial: that the police had initially had few leads and had cast a very wide net to find the killer. The officers inquired about sex offenders known to live in or frequent the neighborhood surrounding the abandoned building where the victim had been found. They followed tips, often based on rumor and second- and third-hand information, concerning individuals who had made incriminating statements or had exhibited suspicious behavior, individuals who had been seen in or around the abandoned building or the surrounding neighborhood, and individuals who had been seen with the victim around the time of the murder. They also obtained information that impeached the victim\u2019s brother\u2019s credibility and contradicted the state\u2019s theory concerning when the murder had occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-4\">{\u00b6 40} From our review of the record, we conclude that the undisclosed evidence, viewed collectively, was not \u201cmaterial\u201d in that it could not \u201creasonably be taken to put the whole case in such a different light as to undermine confidence in the verdict[s].\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Therefore, the state\u2019s failure to disclose the evidence did not deny Gumm his constitutional right to a fair trial.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Moreover, the record will not permit the conclusion that, but for the state\u2019s failure to disclose the evidence, no reasonable factfinder would have found him guilty of the offenses of which he was convicted. Thus, Gumm failed to satisfy the R.C. 2953.23 jurisdictional requirement of outcome-determinative constitutional error.

But recognizing the gravity of the issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>in this case, I must respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s opinion upholding the determination that Darryl Gumm successfully rebutted the presumption that he is not now, nor has he ever been, mentally retarded. As a result of the trial court\u2019s decision, Gumm has been afforded a complete bar to his death sentence that was imposed in 1992 for the aggravated murder of ten-year-old Aaron Raines.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">{\u00b6 43} The Ohio Supreme Court in <em>State v. Lott,</em><footnotemark><em>22</em></footnotemark><em> </em>interpreting <em>Atkins v. Virginia</em><footnotemark><em>23</em></footnotemark><em> </em>crafted a postconviction opportunity for death-row defendants to litigate claims of mental retardation, even when a defendant\u2019s objective indicia of nonretardation is evidenced by several IQ scores above 70.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">{\u00b6 44} In making its determination, a trial court must first consider whether the defendant has significantly subaverage intellectual functioning. Intellectual functioning is defined by the intelligence quotient (\u201cIQ\u201d) obtained by assessment under one or more of the standardized, individually administered intelligence tests. Significantly subaverage intellectual functioning is defined as an IQ of about 70 or below (approximately two standard deviations below the mean). It is here that the trial court initially, in my opinion, erred because Gumm had scored consistently above 70 on IQ tests before the age of 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">{\u00b6 45} In considering the first <em>Lott </em>prong, the trial court determined that Gumm had met his burden of proving that he had significantly subaverage intellectual functioning. The court explained that \u201cthe IQ test administered to Gumm clearly show [sic] that he is two deviations removed from the norm, i.e., 100.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b694-8\">{\u00b6 46} But this finding was simply not supported by the evidence. Gumm had obtained scores of 73, 70, 71, and 79 on four tests administered before the age of 18. As the trial court noted, the first two scores were obtained by StanfordBinet tests, which had a standard deviation of 16. The remaining scores were obtained by Wechsler Intelligence Scale tests, which had a standard deviation of 15. On <em>none </em>of these tests did Gumm\u2019s score indicate that he was two deviations removed from the norm.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-9\">{\u00b6 47} A fifth IQ test was administered to Gumm while he was incarcerated.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> This was the only test on which Gumm could be said to have tested two deviations from the norm. At the time of the test, Gumm was 26 years old and was just <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>weeks away from being tried for capital murder. The defense expert acknowledged that both of these circumstances may have yielded an unreliable IQ score.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">{\u00b6 48} In fact, the expert testified that he did not administer an IQ test in preparation for Gumm\u2019s <em>Atkins </em>hearing because it would have given an invalid view of Gumm\u2019s functioning. In his view, \u201ctesting that is conducted after the age of 18 certainly would be open to reasonable question about validity, motivation, about the extent which someone tried their best, given the circumstances of the assessment.\u201d In addition, the expert testified, IQ evaluations conducted in restrictive settings such as prisons \u201care not really valid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">{\u00b6 49} Moreover, the expert testified that \u201cGumm\u2019s intelligence test scores are consistent with mental retardation <em>when one takes into account the standard error of measurement.\u201d </em>But, upon questioning by the court, the expert admitted that the error of measurement went both ways:</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">{\u00b6 50} \u201c[Court]: So assuming for the mathematics you are talking about error rate of 3, the 73 test could be either 67 or a 76, right? If we are using plus or minus 3 \u2014 [.]</p>\n<p id=\"b695-8\">{\u00b6 51} \u201c[Expert]: Plus or minus from 3 from 73 would be 70 to 76, yes. And using the 5 it would be 68 to 78.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b695-9\">{\u00b6 52} When asked by defense counsel whether he had an opinion whether Gumm would be \u201con the higher end or the lower end,\u201d the expert said, \u201cThere would be no way of knowing it. It\u2019s a guideline. It can vary depending upon conditions, examiners. There would be no way of doing that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b695-10\">{\u00b6 53} As the trial court pointed out, application of the standard error of measurement made it <em>equally probable </em>that Gumm\u2019s IQ was higher than 70. In fact, the court specifically concluded that Gumm had \u201cfailed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence [that] his IQ was 70 or less.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b695-11\">{\u00b6 54} Accordingly, I believe that the trial court\u2019s determination that Gumm successfully rebutted the presumption that he is not mentally retarded was not supported by reliable evidence. Gumm\u2019s failure to prove that he had significantly subaverage intellectual functioning, as evidenced by the repeated scores above 70, should have stopped the court\u2019s inquiry at that point.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-12\">{\u00b6 55} Moreover, <em>Lott </em>requires evidence of <em>present </em>retardation. Indeed, the AAMR identifies several assumptions that it deems \u201cessential to the application\u201d of its definition of mental retardation. One assumption is that \u201c[l]imitations in <em>present functioning </em>must be considered within the context of community environments typical of the individual\u2019s age peer and culture.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Another assumption is that <em>\u201c[w]ith appropriate personalized supports </em>over a sustained period, the <em>life functioning </em>of the person with mental retardation <em>generally mil improve.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>{\u00b6 56} According to the AAMR, \u201c[a]daptive behavior is the collection of conceptual, social, and practical skills that people have learned so they can function in their everyday lives. Significant limitations in adaptive behavior impact a person\u2019s daily life and affect the ability to respond to a particular situation or to the environment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">{\u00b6 57} Despite the AAMR\u2019s emphasis on an individual\u2019s present functioning and environment, the trial court simply noted that Gumm had \u201cadapted to his surroundings in the penitentiary.\u201d In finding that Gumm had significant limitations in adaptive skills, the court relied on the testimony of teachers who had not seen Gumm since he was in middle school more than 20 years earlier. But their testimony would hardly have been relevant to a determination of whether Gumm is <em>presently </em>mentally retarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">{\u00b6 58} Relying on the testimony of teachers from 20 years earlier instead of on the testimony of workers from the Ohio Department of Corrections who had present-day contact with Gumm, the trial court concluded that Gumm had overcome the presumption of nonretardation and thus should be spared the ultimate penalty for his crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">{\u00b6 59} The trial court stated that it was \u201ckeenly aware [that] once a trial court makes a determination of the Defendant\u2019s mental retardation status, that decision will not be disturbed on appeal, absent an abuse of discretion.\u201d To the contrary, an appellate court will reverse a trial court\u2019s determination that a defendant is mentally retarded if the determination is not supported by reliable, credible evidence.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b696-8\">{\u00b6 60} Here, the trial court determined that Gumm had successfully rebutted the presumption that he was not mentally retarded. But the fact that the court\u2019s determination was not supported by reliable and credible evidence supports the opposite finding. I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b694-10\">. 97 Ohio St.3d 303, 2002-Ohio-6625, 779 N.E.2d 1011.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b694-11\">.
