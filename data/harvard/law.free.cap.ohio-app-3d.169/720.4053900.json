No. 292 (\u201cH.B. 292\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b758-16\">{\u00b6 2} From 1964 to his retirement in April 2000, Chester Wilson was employed by A.K. Steel Corporation, formerly known as Armco Steel Corporation, located in Butler County, Ohio. Mr. Wilson worked in various jobs around the plant, including the position of furnace tender. On August 4, 2000, Mr. Wilson, who was a two-or-three-pack-a-day smoker, was diagnosed with lung cancer.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>{\u00b6 3} On December 14, 2001, Mr. Wilson filed a complaint against a number of companies (hereinafter \u201cappellants\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>) that have been engaged in the mining, processing, manufacturing, sale, and distribution of asbestos or asbestos-containing products or machinery. Mr. Wilson alleged that he had been exposed to asbestos or asbestos-containing products or machinery in his occupation and that appellants were responsible for his lung disease and related physical ailments from which he suffered.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">{\u00b6 4} On April 15, 2003, Mr. Wilson died of lung cancer. Thereafter, Mr. Wilson\u2019s wife, Barbara Wilson, was substituted as the party in interest for the deceased Mr. Wilson.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">{\u00b6 5} On September 2, 2004, H.B. 292 went into effect. The key provisions of H.B. 292 are codified in R.C. 2307.91 to 2307.98. Among other things, these provisions require a plaintiff bringing an asbestos claim to make a prima facie showing that the exposed person has a physical impairment resulting from a medical condition and that the person\u2019s exposure to asbestos was a substantial contributing factor to the medical condition. See R.C. 2307.92(B) through (D) and 2307.93(A)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-7\">{\u00b6 6} In March 2005, appellee filed a motion, with several exhibits attached, seeking to establish the prima facie showing required under H.B. 292. Appellants filed a memorandum in opposition, asserting that appellee\u2019s proffered evidence failed to establish a sufficient prima facie showing to allow her case to proceed and requesting that appellee\u2019s case be administratively dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-8\">{\u00b6 7} On August 30, 2005, the trial court held a hearing on the parties\u2019 various assertions regarding appellee\u2019s asbestos claim. At the hearing, appellee acknowledged that her evidence was insufficient to establish the prima facie showing required under H.B. 292. Nevertheless, appellee argued that H.B. 292 should not apply to her asbestos claim because applying the new law to her claim would amount to an unconstitutional retroactive application of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-9\">{\u00b6 8} On February 24, 2006, the trial court issued an order holding that the retroactive application of H.B. 292 was substantive rather than merely remedial in its effect and therefore violates Section 28, Article II of the Ohio Constitution. Consequently, the trial court announced its intention to \u201cadjudicate substantive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>issues in asbestos cases filed before September 2, 2004 according to the law as it existed prior to [H.B. 292]\u2019s enactment, and [to] administratively dismiss, without prejudice, any claim that fails to meet the requisite evidentiary threshold.\u201d The trial court journalized its order on March 7, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">{\u00b6 9} Appellants now appeal from the trial court\u2019s March 7, 2006 order<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and assign the following as error:</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">{\u00b6 10} Assignment of Error No. 1:</p>\n<p id=\"b760-7\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cThe trial court erred in interpreting R.C. 2307.92 and concluding that the statute would violate the Ohio Constitution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b760-8\">{\u00b6 12} Appellants argue that the trial court erred in concluding that retrospectively applying certain provisions in H.B. 292 to this case would violate the ban on retroactive legislation in Section 28, Article II of the Ohio Constitution. We agree with this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b760-10\">{\u00b6 13} OVERVIEW OF OHIO\u2019S PERSONAL-INJURY ASBESTOS LITIGATION SYSTEM \u2014 PAST and PRESENT</p>\n<p id=\"b760-11\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b760-12\">{\u00b6 14} <em>Ohio's Personal-Injury Asbestos Litigation System </em>\u2014 Pre-H.B. <em>292</em></p>\n<p id=\"b760-13\">{\u00b6 15} In 1980, the General Assembly amended R.C. 2305.10 to state when a cause of action for an asbestos-related personal injury arises or accrues under Ohio law. 138 Ohio Laws, Part II, 3412. R.C. 2305.10(B)(5) now states:</p>\n<p id=\"b760-14\">{\u00b6 16} \u201c[A] cause of action for bodily injury caused by exposure to asbestos accrues upon the date on which the plaintiff is informed by competent medical authority that the plaintiff has an injury that is related to the exposure, or upon the date on which by the exercise of reasonable diligence the plaintiff should have known that the plaintiff has an injury that is related to the exposure, whichever date occurs first.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b760-15\">{\u00b6 17} Prior to September 2, 2004, the General Assembly had never defined the terms \u201cbodily injury caused by exposure to asbestos\u201d or \u201ccompetent medical authority.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AIW\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">{\u00b6 18} <em>Ohio\u2019s Asbestos Litigation Crisis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">{\u00b6 19} Asbestos claims have created a vastly increased amount of litigation in the state and federal courts in this country, which the United States Supreme Court has characterized as \u201can elephantine mass\u201d of cases. H.B. 292, Section 3(A); <em>Ortiz v. Fibreboard Corp. </em>(1999), 527 U.S. 815, 821, 119 S.Ct. 2295, 144 L.Ed.2d 715.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-7\">{\u00b6 20} The extraordinary volume of nonmalignant asbestos cases continues to strain federal and state courts. H.B. 292, Section 3(A). Over 600,000 people in the United States have filed asbestos claims for asbestos-related personal injuries through the end of 2000, and it is estimated that there are currently more than 200,000 active asbestos cases in courts nationwide.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-8\">{\u00b6 21} One report suggests \u201cthat at best, only one-half of all claimants have come forward and at worst, only one-fifth have filed claims to date.\u201d Id. Another study estimates that $54 billion have already been spent on asbestos litigation. Id. Estimates of the total costs of all asbestos claims range from $200 to $265 billion. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-9\">{\u00b6 22} Before 1998, Ohio, Mississippi, New York, West Virginia, and Texas accounted for nine per cent of all filings of asbestos claims. However, between 1998 and 2000, these same five states handled 66 percent of all asbestos filings. As a result, Ohio has now become a haven for asbestos claims and is one of the top five state-court venues for asbestos filings. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-10\">{\u00b6 23} There are at least 35,000 asbestos personal-injury cases pending in Ohio state courts. Id. If the 233 Ohio state-court general jurisdictional judges started trying these asbestos cases today, each would have to try over 150 cases before retiring the current docket. H.B. 292, Section 3(A). That figure conservatively computes to at least 150 trial weeks, or more than three years per judge to retire the current docket. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-11\">{\u00b6 24} \u201cThe current docket, however, continues to increase at an exponential rate.\u201d Id. For example, in 1999 there were approximately 12,800 pending asbestos cases in Cuyahoga County. Id. However, by the end of October 2003, there were over 39,000 pending asbestos cases. Id. Approximately 200 new asbestos cases are filed in Cuyahoga County every month. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-12\">{\u00b6 25} Asbestos personal-injury litigation has already contributed to the bankruptcy of more than 70 companies nationwide, including nearly all manufacturers of asbestos textile and insulation products. Id. \u201cAt least five Ohio-based companies have been forced into bankruptcy because of an unending flood of asbestos cases brought by claimants who are not sick.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>{\u00b6 26} The General Assembly has recognized \u201cthat the vast majority of Ohio asbestos claims are filed by individuals who allege they have been exposed to asbestos and who have some physical sign of exposure to asbestos, but who do not suffer from an asbestos-related impairment.\u201d Id. Indeed, 89 percent of asbestos claims come from people who do not have cancer, and 66 to 90 percent of these noncancer claimants are not sick. Id. Furthermore, according to one study, 94 percent of the 52,900 asbestos claims filed in the year 2000 involved claimants who are not sick. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">{\u00b6 27} Tragically, plaintiffs with asbestos claims are receiving less than 43 cents on every dollar awarded, and 65 per cent of the compensation paid, thus far, has gone to claimants who are not sick. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">{\u00b6 28} <em>Amended Substitute House Bill 292</em></p>\n<p id=\"b762-8\">{\u00b6 29} H.B. 292 was signed into law on June 3, 2004, and took effect on September 2, 2004. The key portions of the law are codified in R.C. 2307.91 to 2307.98. The basic purpose of the law is to resolve this state\u2019s asbestos-litigation crisis.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-9\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b762-10\">{\u00b6 30} <em>Legislative Intent in Enacting H.B. 292</em></p>\n<p id=\"b762-11\">{\u00b6 31} Section 3(B) of H.B. 292 states:</p>\n<p id=\"b762-12\">{\u00b6 32} \u201cIn enacting sections 2307.91 to 2307.98 of the Revised Code, it is the intent of the General Assembly to: (1) give priority to those asbestos claimants who can demonstrate actual physical harm or illness caused by exposure to asbestos; (2) fully preserve the rights of claimants who were exposed to asbestos to pursue compensation should those claimants become impaired in the future as a result of such exposure; (3) enhance the ability of the state\u2019s judicial systems and federal judicial systems to supervise and control litigation and asbestos-related bankruptcy proceedings; and (4) conserve the scarce resources of the defendants to allow compensation of cancer victims and others who are physically impaired by exposure to asbestos while securing the right to similar compensation for those who may suffer physical impairment in the future.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b762-13\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b762-14\">{II33} <em>R.C. 2307.92: Prima Facie Showing of Minimum Medical Requirements</em></p>\n<p id=\"b762-15\">{\u00b6 34} R.C. 2307.92 establishes the minimum medical requirements that a plaintiff with an asbestos claim must meet in order to maintain the action and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>requires the plaintiff to make a prima facie showing of those minimum requirements. The provisions of R.C. 2307.92 categorize asbestos claimants into three distinct categories: (1) claimants who are advancing an asbestos claim based on \u201ca non-malignant condition,\u201d R.C. 2307.92(B); (2) claimants who are advancing an asbestos claim based upon \u201clung cancer of an exposed person who is a smoker,\u201d R.C. 2307.92(C)(1); and (3) claimants who are advancing an asbestos claim that is based upon \u201ca wrongful death * * * of an exposed person[.]\u201d R.C. 2307.92(D)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">{\u00b6 35} The case sub judice involves a claimant, i.e., appellant, who is acting as the personal representative of her late husband, who was a smoker. Appellant claims that her late husband\u2019s lung cancer was caused by his exposure to asbestos. Appellant is also bringing a wrongful-death claim. Therefore, appellant\u2019s claims would be governed by R.C. 2307.92(C)(1) and (D)(1), assuming that the relevant provisions of H.B. 292 can be applied retroactively to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">{\u00b6 36} R.C. 2307.92(C)(1) prohibits any person from bringing or maintaining a tort action alleging an asbestos claim based upon lung cancer of an exposed person who is a smoker, in the absence of a prima facie showing, in the manner described in R.C. 2307.93(A), that the exposed person has a physical impairment, that the physical impairment is a result of a medical condition, and that the person\u2019s exposure to asbestos is a substantial contributing factor to the medical condition. The prima facie showing must include all of the following minimum requirements:</p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">{\u00b6 37} \u201c(a) A diagnosis by a competent medical authority that the exposed person has primary lung cancer and that exposure to asbestos is a substantial contributing factor to that cancer;</p>\n<p id=\"b763-8\">{\u00b6 38} \u201c(b) Evidence that is sufficient to demonstrate that at least ten years have elapsed from the date of the exposed person\u2019s first exposure to asbestos until the date of diagnosis of the exposed person\u2019s primary lung cancer. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b763-9\">{\u00b6 39} \u201c(c) Either of the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b763-10\">{\u00b6 40} \u201c(i) Evidence of the exposed person\u2019s substantial occupational exposure to asbestos;</p>\n<p id=\"b763-11\">{\u00b6 41} \u201c(ii) Evidence of the exposed person\u2019s exposure to asbestos at least equal to 25 fiber per cc years as determined to a reasonable degree of scientific probability * *</p>\n<p id=\"b763-12\">{\u00b6 42} R.C. 2307.92(D)(1) requires a similar prima facie showing to be made by a claimant who is bringing or maintaining an asbestos claim that is based upon a wrongful death.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-13\">3</p>\n<p id=\"b763-14\">{\u00b6 43} <em>R.C. 2307.93: Filing of Prima Facie Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>{\u00b6 44} R.C. 2307.93(A)(1) requires the plaintiff in an asbestos action to file, within 30 days after filing the complaint or other initial pleading, \u201ca written report and supporting test results constituting prima-facie [sic] evidence of the exposed person\u2019s physical impairment that meets the minimum requirements specified in [R.C. 2307.92(B), (C), or (D) ], whichever is applicable.\u201d The defendant in the case has 120 days from the date the specified type of prima facie evidence is proffered to challenge the adequacy of that evidence. R.C. 2307.93(A)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">{\u00b6 45} If the defendant in an asbestos action challenges the adequacy of the prima facie evidence of the exposed person\u2019s physical impairment as provided in R.C. 2307.93(A)(1), the trial court, using the standard for resolving a motion for summary judgment, must determine whether the proffered prima facie evidence meets the minimum requirements specified in R.C. 2307.92(B), (C), or (D). R.C. 2307.93(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">{\u00b6 46} If the trial court finds that the plaintiff failed to make the requisite prima facie showing, the court must administratively dismiss the plaintiffs claim without prejudice. R.C. 2307.93(C). Any plaintiff whose case has been administratively dismissed may move to reinstate his or her case if the plaintiff makes a prima facie showing that meets the requirements of R.C. 2307.92(B), (C), or (D). R.C. 2307.93(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b764-7\">{\u00b6 47} R.C. 2307.93(A)(2) provides that with respect to any asbestos claim that is pending on the effective date of the statute, the plaintiff must file the written report and supporting test results described in R.C. 2307.93(A)(1) within 120 days following the effective date of the statute. The trial court, upon plaintiffs motion and for good cause shown, may extend the 120-day period in which the written report and supporting test results must be filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-8\">4</p>\n<p id=\"b764-9\">{\u00b6 48} <em>The \u201cSavings Clause\u201d in R.C. 2307.93(A)(3)(b)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b764-10\">{\u00b6 49} R.C. 2307.93(A)(3) contains a \u201csavings clause,\u201d which provides that for any cause of action arising before the effective date of this section, the provisions set forth in R.C. 2307.92(B), (C), and (D) are to be applied unless the court finds that \u201c[a] substantive right of a party to the case has been impaired\u201d <em>and </em>that \u201cthat impairment is otherwise in violation of Section 28 of Article II of the Ohio Constitution.\u201d If the court makes both of those findings, it must apply the law that is in effect prior to the effective date of R.C. 2307.93.

Though the language of Section 28, Article II of the Ohio Constitution provides that the General Assembly \u2018shall have no power to pass retroactive laws,\u2019 Ohio courts have long recognized that there is a crucial distinction between statutes that merely apply retroactively (or \u2018retrospectively\u2019) and those that do so in a manner that offends our Constitution. See, e.g., <em>Rairden v. Holden </em>(1864), 15 Ohio St. 207, 210-211; <em>State v. Cook, </em>83 Ohio St.3d [404,] 410, 700 N.E.2d 570, * * *. [T]he words \u2018retroactive\u2019 and \u2018retrospective\u2019 have been used interchangeably in the constitutional analysis for more than a century. Id.

For example, R.C. 2307.93(A)(2) and (3)(a) require a plaintiff with an asbestos claim pending on the effective date of that section to comply with the requirements of filing a prima facie case set forth in R.C. 2307.92. Thus, it is clear that the General Assembly expressly intended for the provisions in R.C. 2307.91 through 2307.93 to apply retroactively.

Appellee still has the right to proceed with that cause of action and to recover for an injury caused by her husband\u2019s exposure to asbestos. The relevant provisions of H.B. 292 merely affect the methods and procedure by which that cause of action is recognized, protected, and enforced, not the cause of action itself. <em>Bielat, </em>87 Ohio St.3d at 354, 721 N.E.2d 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-8\">{\u00b6 78} For example, R.C. 2307.91(Z) defines the term \u201ccompetent medical authority\u201d and lists the requirements that have to be met to allow a court to determine that a medical doctor is competent to provide a diagnosis for purposes of constituting prima facie evidence of an exposed person\u2019s physical impairment that meets the requirements specified in R.C. 2307.92. Appellee cites the new definition of this term to demonstrate that her vested right in her accrued cause of action has been unconstitutionally impaired.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-9\">{\u00b6 79} However, because this statute \u201cpertains to the competency of a witness to testify * * * it is of a remedial or procedural [rather than substantive] nature.\u201d <em>Denicola v. Providence Hosp. </em>(1979), 57 Ohio St.2d 115, 117, 11 O.O.3d 290, 387 N.E.2d 231. Since the provision is procedural or remedial rather than substantive, it does not offend the Ohio Constitution. See <em>Bielat, </em>87 Ohio St.3d at 354, 721 N.E.2d 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-10\">{\u00b6 80} Both the trial court and appellee have argued in these proceedings that H.B. 292 should not be applied to cases that were pending on the date the statute became effective, because the new statute requires plaintiffs who bring an asbestos claim \u201cto meet an evidentiary threshold that extends above and beyond <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>the common law standard \u2014 the standard that existed at the time [Mr. Wilson] filed his claim.\u201d As an example of the common-law standard, the trial court cited <em>In re Cuyahoga County Asbestos Cases </em>(1998), 127 Ohio App.3d 358, 713 N.E.2d 20, which held that a plaintiff seeking redress for asbestos-related injuries had a compensable claim when he could show that asbestos had caused an alteration of the lining of the lung. Id. at 364, 713 N.E.2d 20. We find this reasoning unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">{\u00b6 81} While a vested right may be created by the common law, see <em>Weil, </em>139 Ohio St. 198, 22 O.O. 205, 39 N.E.2d 148, it is well settled that \u201cthere is no property or vested right in any of the rules of the common law, as guides of conduct, and they may be added to or repealed by legislative authority.\u201d <em>Leis v. Cleveland R. Co. </em>(1920), 101 Ohio St. 162, 128 N.E. 73, syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">{\u00b6 82} Furthermore, as the Ohio Attorney General has pointed out in his amicus curiae brief, \u201c[i]t is difficult to maintain * * * that someone has a vested right to a standard that is not the law of the entire State, and is certainly not binding on other appellate districts across the State.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">{\u00b6 83} Additionally, a right cannot be considered \u201cvested\u201d unless it amounts to something more than a mere expectation of future benefit or interest founded upon an anticipated continuance of existing laws. <em>Roberts, </em>147 Ohio App.3d at 411, 770 N.E.2d 1085. In this case, it appears that appellee had nothing more than a mere expectation of future benefit founded upon an anticipated continuance of the law. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-8\">{\u00b6 84} In light of the foregoing, we conclude that appellee has failed to demonstrate that the retroactive application of H.B. 292 will deprive or diminish any vested right held by her or her late husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-9\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b770-10\">{\u00b6 85} <em>Accrued Substantive Rights</em></p>\n<p id=\"b770-11\">{\u00b6 86} The term \u201caccrued substantive rights\u201d has often been used synonymously with the term \u201cvested rights.\u201d See, e.g., <em>Bielat, </em>87 Ohio St.3d at 357, 721 N.E.2d 28. The term \u201caccrued\u201d in its usual or customary meaning is defined as \u201c \u2018to come into existence as an enforceable claim: vest as a right.\u2019 \u201d <em>State ex rel.

The term \u201csubstantive right\u201d has been defined as \u201ca right that can be protected or enforced by law.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (8th Ed.2004) 1349.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-12\">{\u00b6 87} Appellee asserts that R.C. 2307.91(FF)\u2019s definition of \u201csubstantial contributing factor\u201d represents a \u201cdramatic departure\u201d from the definition of \u201csubstantial factor\u201d in the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Horton v.

We disagree with this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">{\u00b6 88} As appellants themselves acknowledge, the General Assembly is not free to make retroactive changes to the settled meaning of a law. When the Ohio Supreme Court interprets a key word or phrase in a statute, those interpretations define substantive rights given to persons who are affected by the statute. <em>Hearing v. Wylie </em>(1962), 173 Ohio St. 221, 224, 19 O.O.2d 42, 180 N.E.2d 921, overruled on other grounds by <em>Village v. Gen. Motors Corp. </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 129, 15 OBR 279, 472 N.E.2d 1079. If those substantive rights are substantially altered by the General Assembly when it amends the definition of that key word or phrase, then the amendment cannot be made to apply retroactively to any action pending at the time of the change, since such a retroactive application of a substantive provision would violate Section 28, Article II of the Ohio Constitution. See <em>Hearing v. Wylie.</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em>,</em></p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">{\u00b6 89} Appellee argues that the definitions of \u201csubstantial contributing factor\u201d and \u201csubstantial occupational exposure to asbestos\u201d in R.C. 2307.91(FF) and (GG), respectively, constitute an attempt by the Ohio General Assembly to make an impermissible retroactive change to the settled law in this state regarding the meaning of those phrases.

There are frequently a number of events each of which is not only a necessary antecedent to the other\u2019s harm, but is also recognizable as having an appreciable effect in bringing it about. Of these the actor\u2019s conduct is only one. Some other event which is a contributing factor in producing the harm may have such a <em>predominant </em>effect in bringing it about as to make the effect of the actor\u2019s negligence insignificant and, therefore, to prevent it from being a substantial factor.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b773-8\">{\u00b6 104} When all of the foregoing is considered, it is apparent that the \u201cpredominant cause\u201d element in R.C. 2307.91(FF) is consistent with Section 431, Comment <em>a </em>of the Restatement of the Law 2d, Torts, adopted in <em>Horton. </em>See <em>Horton, </em>73 Ohio St.3d at 686, 653 N.E.2d 1196.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-9\">{\u00b6 105} We also reject appellee\u2019s argument that R.C. 2307.91(FF) is in conflict with <em>Horton </em>because it contains a requirement that a \u201ccompetent medical authority\u201d determine with a reasonable degree of medical certainty that without the asbestos exposures, the physical impairment of the exposed person would not have occurred. R.C. 2307.91(FF)(2). R.C. 2305.10 has always used the term \u201ccompetent medical authority.\u201d Prior to H.B. 292, neither the General Assembly nor the Ohio Supreme Court had defined the phrase, and, therefore, it was appropriate for the General Assembly to define that phrase. Additionally, defining the term \u201ccompetent medical authority\u201d is clearly a procedural, rather than a substantive, act. See <em>Denicola, </em>57 Ohio St.2d at 117, 11 O.O.3d 290, 387 N.E.2d 231.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-10\">{\u00b6 106} Furthermore, including a \u201cbut for\u201d component in the definition of \u201csubstantial contributing factor\u201d contained in R.C. 2307.91(FF)(2) (i.e., the competent medical authority must determine with a reasonable degree of medical certainty that the physical impairment would not have occurred without or \u201cbut for\u201d the asbestos exposures) is consistent with this state\u2019s long-standing definition of \u201cproximate cause,\u201d to wit: \u201cBriefly stated, the proximate cause of an event is that which in a natural and continuous sequence, unbroken by any new, independent cause, produces that event and without which that event would not have occurred.\u201d <em>Aiken v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1944), 143 Ohio St. 113, 117, 28 O.O. 50, 53 N.E.2d 1018. We also find the \u201cbut for\u201d requirement consistent with Section 431, Comment <em>a </em>of the Restatement of the Law 2d, Torts, adopted in <em>Horton, </em>73 Ohio <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>St.3d at 686, 653 N.E.2d 1196, which uses the word \u201ccause\u201d in its \u201c \u2018popular sense, in which there always lurks the idea of responsibility, rather than the so-called \u201cphilosophical\u201d sense, which includes every one of the great number of events without which any happening would not have occurred.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">{\u00b6 107} We also agree with the following arguments presented by Owens-Illinois, Inc., in its amicus curiae brief, regarding these issues:</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">(\u00b6 108} \u201cR.C. 2307.91(FF) and 2307.92(B-D) [do not] conflict with <em>Horton v. Harwick Chemical Corp., </em>as [appellee] contend[s]. These sections address a different issue than the one addressed in <em>Horton. </em>In <em>Horton, </em>the Ohio Supreme Court rejected the \u2018frequency, regularity, and proximity\u2019 test of <em>Lohrmann </em>for determining \u2018whether a particular product was a substantial factor in producing the plaintiffs injury.\u2019 <em>Horton, </em>73 Ohio St.3d at 683, 653 N.E.2d at 1200 (emphasis added). As the Court made clear, it was addressing the standard for proving the liability of <em>\u2018each defendant </em>in a multidefendant asbestos case\u2019 and the causative role of \u2018exposure to <em>the defendant\u2019s product\u2019 </em>\u2014 as opposed to the causative role of asbestos generally \u2014 at the proof (summary judgment) stage. Id. at 686, 653 N.E.2d at 1202 (emphasis added). The Court declined to require a plaintiff to \u2018prove that he was exposed to a <em>specific product </em>on a regular basis over some extended period of time in close proximity to where the plaintiff actually worked in order to prove that <em>the product </em>was a substantial factor in causing his injury.\u2019 Id. (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b774-7\">{\u00b6 109} \u201cR.C. 2307.92, by contrast, does not concern proof or whether exposure to an individual defendant\u2019s individual product caused an injury. Instead, it concerns only the threshold, prima facie showing of collective exposure to asbestos, and whether that collective exposure was sufficient to cause the injury. The prima facie showing serves only to identify whether the case genuinely involves asbestos-related injury, and not the further and more difficult question whether a particular product or particular defendant is responsible. [Footnote Omitted.] Since <em>Horton </em>did not address this issue at all, this section of HB 292 cannot conflict with <em>Horton.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b774-8\">{\u00b6 110} \u201cThere is a section of HB 292 that contravenes <em>Horton, </em>but it is expressly made only prospective, raising no retroactivity issues. R.C. 2307.96, which governs the standard for proving \u2018that the conduct of [a] particular defendant was a substantial factor in causing the injury,\u2019 was expressly intended to reject <em>Horton </em>and to adopt the \u2018frequency, regularity, and proximity\u2019 test of <em>Lohrmann. See </em>H.B. 292, Section 5 * * * (discussing the reasons the legislature disagreed with the Court about the value of the <em>Lohrmann </em>test). The General Assembly was careful to make this section <em>prospective </em>only. <em>See </em>R.C. 2307.96(C) (\u2018This section applies only to tort actions that allege any injury or loss to person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>resulting from exposure to asbestos and that are <em>brought on or after the effective date of this section.\u2019) </em>(emphasis added). [Footnote omitted.]</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">{Kill} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">{K112} \u201cFinally, HB 292\u2019s requirement (in smoker/lung cancer and wrongful death cases only) of a prima facie showing either of \u2018substantial occupational exposure\u2019 to asbestos or of exposure equal to 25 fiber per cc years (R.C. 2307.92(C)(1)(c), 2307.92(D)(1)(c)), does not \u2018reimpose\u2019 the <em>Lohrmann </em>test that the Ohio Supreme Court had rejected in <em>Horton. </em>This is true for the same reasons discussed above: First, the \u2018substantial occupational exposure\u2019 provisions were not intended to \u2018reimpose\u2019 the <em>Lohrmann </em>test. The General Assemble knew how to adopt <em>Lohrmann, </em>and when it did so, it respected the boundaries of its power and did so prospectively. Second, these provisions again address the prima facie case (whether the claimant had sufficient collective exposure to asbestos generally to state a colorable claim of asbestos-related injury), and not the issue of proof regarding an individual product or defendant, which was the issue in <em>Horton.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b775-7\">{K 113} \u201cRather than addressing the question at issue in <em>Horton </em>(how a plaintiff may prove that a particular defendant, out of all the parties to whose products the plaintiff was exposed, is liable for its role in causing an injury), the \u2018substantial occupational exposure\u2019 provisions are one of two alternative means by which a plaintiff may satisfy a prima facie asbestos exposure threshold in lung cancer and wrongful death cases. Since 1980 it has been the law in Ohio by statute that an asbestos claim requires \u2018injury caused by exposure to asbestos.\u2019 R.C. 2305.10. HB 292 merely defines two alternative ways to [make a prima facie] showing of] exposure, displacing no statute or Supreme Court case law: either by a direct showing under a quantitative standard (25 fiber per cc years) or by a showing of \u2018substantial occupational exposure\u2019 (five years\u2019 work in a job in which the worker either handled raw asbestos, or fabricated asbestos-containing products, or worked with asbestos-containing products, or worked close to others who did these thing). This legislative clarification and specification of \u2018exposure\u2019 is not unconstitutionally retroactive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b775-8\">{K 114} In light of the foregoing, we conclude that applying R.C. 2307.91(FF) and (GG) to actions filed before the effective date of H.B. 292 does not violate Section 28, Article II of the Ohio Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-9\">3</p>\n<p id=\"b775-10\">{K 115} <em>Imposition of New or Additional Burdens, Duties, etc.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b775-11\">{K 116} As to the issue of whether retroactive application of the relevant provisions of H.B. 292 would impose \u201cnew or additional burdens, duties, obli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>gations, or liabilities as to a past transaction,\u201d we first note that appellants contend that this branch of the test for unconstitutional retroactivity \u201cconcerns vested rights in past acts, such as business activity or contracts, and has no obvious application to tort actions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\">{\u00b6 117} However, it appears that this branch of the test for unconstitutional retroactivity has a wider application than business activity or contracts. For instance, in <em>Bielat, </em>the court stated, \u201cThe retroactivity clause nullifies those new laws that \u2018reach back and create new burdens, new duties, new obligations, or new liabilities not existing at the time [the statute becomes effective].\u2019 \u201d <em>Bielat, </em>87 Ohio St.3d at 352-353, 721 N.E.2d 28, quoting <em>Miller, </em>64 Ohio St. at 51, 59 N.E. 749.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">{\u00b6 118} Nevertheless, we conclude that the retroactive application of the relevant provisions of H.B. 292 does not impose any \u201cnew or additional burdens, duties, obligations, or liabilities\u201d on persons seeking to bring an asbestos claim. The changes made by H.B. 292, such as defining \u201ccompetent medical authority,\u201d are procedural or remedial, and not substantive. Therefore, the retroactive application of H.B. 292 does not offend the Ohio Constitution. See <em>Bielat, </em>87 Ohio St.3d at 354, 721 N.E.2d 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">E</p>\n<p id=\"b776-7\">{\u00b6 119} <em>Remedial Retroactive Statutes</em></p>\n<p id=\"b776-8\">{\u00b6 120} A retroactive statute is remedial \u2014 and therefore <em>constitutionally </em>retroactive \u2014 if it is one that affects \u201conly the remedy provided, and include[s] laws that merely substitute a new or more appropriate remedy for the enforcement of an existing right.\u201d <em>Cook, </em>83 Ohio St.3d at 411, 700 N.E.2d 570, citing <em>Van Fossen, </em>36 Ohio St.3d at 107, 522 N.E.2d 489.

See Section 3(A)(3) of H.B. 292. The extraordinary volume of cases has led to circumstances in which the plaintiffs in asbestos actions are receiving less than 43 cents on every dollar awarded, and 65 percent of the compensation paid, thus far, has gone to claimants who are not sick.

However, upon appellants\u2019 application for reconsideration, we reinstated appellants\u2019 appeal on the grounds that the entry appealed from is a provisional remedy as contemplated pursuant to R.C. 2307.93(A)(3) and that because the decision appealed from directly interprets R.C. 2307.93(A)(3), it is a final order pursuant to R.C. 2505.02.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b771-9\">. <em>Hearing v. Wylie </em>states: \u201cThe General Assembly was aware of the decisions of this court interpreting the word \u2018injury.\u2019 Those interpretations defined substantive rights given to injured workmen to be compensated for their injuries. Those substantive rights were substantially altered by the General Assembly when it amended the definition of \u2018injury.\u2019 To attempt to make that substantive change applicable to actions pending at the time of the change is clearly an attempt to make the amendment apply retroactively and is thus violative of Section 28, Article II, Constitution of Ohio.\u201d <em>Hearing, </em>173 Ohio St. at 224, 19 O.O.2d 42, 180 N.E.2d 921.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
