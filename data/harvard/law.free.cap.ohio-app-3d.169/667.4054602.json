(\u201cBuckeye\u201d), has appealed from the judgment of the Wayne County Court of Common Pleas, which found for appellee and cross-appellant, Pioneer Gazebo, Inc. (\u201cPioneer\u201d), on its counterclaim for breach of contract. Additionally, Pioneer has cross-appealed from the judgment of the Wayne County Court of Common Pleas, which denied its complaint for a permanent injunction. This court affirms.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b701-11\">{\u00b6 2} While many of the facts of the underlying matter are highly disputed, several pertinent facts are undisputed. Buckeye and Pioneer began doing business together in 1995. Early in that year, employees of Buckeye spoke with Dan Steiner regarding the possibility of finding an individual in the Amish community to build gazebos that Buckeye would sell. Following a meeting, Steiner and an associate of his, Harley Hochstetler, entered into an agreement with Buckeye regarding the manufacturing of the gazebos. The agreement provided that Buckeye would receive a three percent commission or override on every sale of the gazebos. Thereafter, Steiner located a man, Paul Swartzentruber, who agreed to build the gazebos. On June 11, 1995, the first gazebo was completed. During that year, Steiner alleged that gazebos were sold both to Buckeye and to numerous other individuals.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-12\">{\u00b6 3} In late 1997, Buckeye hired a new sales representative and at that time the parties agreed to increase Buckeye\u2019s commission on the sale of gazebos to five percent of every sale. Steiner alleged that the increase in the commission was contingent upon Buckeye selling at least 200 gazebos annually. Despite not reaching this threshold on numerous occasions, Buckeye continued to receive commissions from Pioneer. Gradually, however, the parties\u2019 business relationship began to deteriorate. In 2000, Buckeye began to suspect that Pioneer was not fully accounting for the sales of the gazebos. The parties\u2019 souring relationship resulted in the instant suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>{\u00b6 4} On February 2, 2005, Pioneer filed suit, seeking a temporary injunction and permanent injunction that would prohibit Buckeye from using the name \u201cPioneer Gazebos\u201d to sell products that were not manufactured by Steiner\u2019s company. In turn, Buckeye counterclaimed against Pioneer, alleging a breach of the commission agreement. The trial court held an initial hearing and denied Pioneer\u2019s request for a temporary injunction. On November 29, 2005, all of the parties\u2019 claims proceeded to a bench trial. At the conclusion of the evidence, the trial court found that neither party had met its burden and denied recovery to both parties. Specifically, the trial court determined that both parties lacked credibility, thereby prohibiting a finding that they had met their burden of proof. Buckeye has timely appealed the trial court\u2019s ruling on its counterclaim, raising one assignment of error for review. Pioneer has timely cross-appealed from the trial court\u2019s ruling on the counts in its complaint, raising three assignments of error for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">Buckeye\u2019s Assignment of Error</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">The court\u2019s decision finding that the appellant did not prove by a preponderance of the evidence the terms of the written commission agreement was against the manifest weight of the evidence, contrary to law, and an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">{\u00b6 5} In its sole assignment of error, Buckeye has asserted that the trial court erred in finding that it had not provided sufficient evidence to support its counterclaim. Specifically, Buckeye has alleged that it provided specific evidence of the terms of the agreement and that the trial court erred in failing to enforce those terms. This court disagrees.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-8\">{\u00b6 6} We review whether a judgment is against the manifest weight of the evidence in a civil context utilizing the same standard of review as that used in the criminal context. <em>Frederick v. Born </em>(Aug. 21, 1996), 9th Dist. No. 95CA006286, 1996 WL 471219, at *6. This court must, therefore, review the entire record, weigh the evidence and all reasonable inferences, consider the credibility of witnesses, and determine whether, in resolving conflicts in the evidence, the trier of fact clearly lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction must be reversed and a new trial ordered. <em>State v. Otten </em>(1986), 33 Ohio App.3d 339, 340, 515 N.E.2d 1009. Further, this court has stated that it \u201cwill not reverse the judgment of the trial court as being against the manifest weight of the evidence if the judgment is based upon some competent, credible evidence that speaks to all of the material elements of the case.\u201d <em>Morris v. Andros, </em>158 Ohio App.3d 396, 2004-Ohio-4446, 815 N.E.2d 1147, at \u00b6 18. \u201cThis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>standard is highly deferential and even 'some' evidence is sufficient to sustain the judgment and prevent reversal.\u201d <em>Bell v. Joecken </em>(Apr. 10, 2002), 9th Dist. No. 20705, 2002 WL 533399, at *2. Therefore, this court\u2019s \u201cdiscretionary power to grant a new trial should be exercised only in the exceptional case in which the evidence weighs heavily\u201d in favor of the plaintiff. <em>State v. Martin </em>(1983), 20 Ohio App.3d 172, 175, 20 OBR 215, 485 N.E.2d 717; see, also, <em>Otten, </em>33 Ohio App.3d at 340, 515 N.E.2d 1009.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">{\u00b6 7} Furthermore, \u201c[i]f a contract is clear and unambiguous, its interpretation is also * * \u2022* a matter of law, and no issue of fact remains to be determined.\u201d <em>Denman v. State Farm Ins. Co., </em>9th Dist. No. 05CA008744, 2006-Ohio-1308, 2006 WL 709104, at \u00b6 13. Contract terms are ambiguous \u201conly if they can be reasonably understood in more than one sense.\u201d <em>Watkins v. Williams, </em>9th Dist. No. 22162, 2004-Ohio-7171, 2004 WL 3017228, at \u00b6 24. \u201cIf a contract is deemed unambiguous, a court must defer to the express terms of the contract and interpret it according to its plain, ordinary, and common meaning.\u201d (Internal quotations omitted.) <em>Haley v. Hunter, </em>9th Dist. No. 23027, 2006-Ohio-2975, 2006 WL 1627135, at \u00b6 15. Courts may resort to extrinsic evidence of the parties\u2019 intent \u201conly where the language is unclear or ambiguous, or where the circumstances surrounding the agreement invest the language of the contract with a special meaning.\u201d <em>Metcalfe v. Akron, </em>9th Dist. No. 23068, 2006-Ohio-4470, 2006 WL 2483875, at \u00b6 18, quoting <em>Kelly v. Med. Life Ins. Co. </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 130, 132, 31 OBR 289, 509 N.E.2d 411.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">{\u00b6 8} We note that the parties did not formally execute a written commission agreement. However, it is undisputed that the parties entered into an agreement through which Buckeye would be paid a commission for gazebos sold by Pioneer. Early in the parties\u2019 business relationship, Buckeye developed a \u201cDealer Sales Recap Sheet,\u201d which Pioneer completed monthly and sent back to Buckeye with a commission check. That sheet contains the following provisions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-7\">Gazebos: Pioneer pays Buckeye 3% on all Gazebos built by Pioneer (not options) except those mutually agreed that there is no commission to be paid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AWs\">Furniture &amp; Other: Pioneer pays Buckeye 3% on all Furniture and other items sold by Pioneer except that mutually agreed that there is no commission to be paid.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b703-8\">Later, by joint agreement, the parties increased the three-percent commission to five percent. Pioneer does not dispute that the above terms were part of the agreement. Further, Pioneer has not contended that the above provisions are ambiguous. Upon our review, we agree that the above contractual provisions are unambiguous because they cannot be \u201creasonably understood in more than one sense.\u201d <em>Watkins </em>at \u00b6 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>{\u00b6 9} It is undisputed that Pioneer, at a minimum, partially performed under the above terms. Pioneer, however, has argued that the trial court properly determined that Buckeye had failed to prove each of the provisions of the commission agreement. Specifically, Pioneer has alleged that the agreement contained a provision that a commission would be paid only if Buckeye sold 200 gazebos, a provision that Buckeye would receive a commission only if invoices were processed in under 45 days, and a provision that Buckeye would receive a commission only if Pioneer\u2019s sales exceeded $1,000,000. Pioneer has pointed to Steiner\u2019s testimony in support of these contentions, along with the testimony of a former Buckeye sales representative, Randy Collier, and a business partner in Pioneer, Paul Swartzentruber.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">{\u00b6 10} A review of the record reveals the following undisputed facts. Pioneer paid in accordance with that agreement for numerous periods. Furthermore, Pioneer paid commissions for periods when Buckeye sold fewer than 200 gazebos. However, at trial, Steiner testified that Pioneer gratuitously paid thousands of dollars in commission that it was not contractually obligated to pay in the hopes that Buckeye would eventually sell 200 units. Steiner asserted that Buckeye promised to improve its sales on a consistent basis. In addition, Collier testified that he was present during the meeting in which the 200-unit threshold was discussed. On cross-examination, however, Collier admitted that he had been terminated by Buckeye and had defaulted on a $10,000 loan given by Buckeye, and that Buckeye currently had a lien on his home.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">{\u00b6 11} While Steiner and Collier presented testimony that may properly be viewed as less than credible, their statements are not wholly unsupported. Steiner produced minutes from a December 11, 1998 meeting of Pioneer\u2019s partners that referenced the 200-unit threshold for receipt of the five percent commission. However, when questioned about those minutes, Steiner admitted that a three percent commission would be paid for all units under 200.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">{\u00b6 12} To confuse matters further, Paul Swartzentruber testified that the five percent commission would not be paid unless Buckeye reached $1,000,000. Furthermore, Steiner testified that Pioneer would have no incentive to pay a commission if Buckeye was not actively marketing its product. Buckeye has ignored this logic, asserting that it is entitled to a commission even if it sells no Pioneer products and Pioneer independently markets its products. It is unclear to this court what the consideration for that contract would be.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-8\">{\u00b6 13} In addition, Pioneer contended below that Buckeye had not always paid invoices within 45 days. In response, Buckeye contended that the rare occasions on which invoices were untimely paid resulted from errors committed by Pioneer in processing the invoices.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>{\u00b6 14} Finally, Buckeye disputed any condition as it related to total sales. Buckeye employees indicated that during initial talks, they had discussed the possibility of selling 100 units. These employees indicated that this initial number was a company goal, but in no way were commissions conditioned upon total sales or any minimum number of gazebos sold. Furthermore, other than Swartzentruber, no party from either business remembered discussing a minimum sales figure prior to paying commissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">{\u00b6 15} Thus, the trial court was presented with conflicting evidence. Moreover, the provisions contained in the Recap Sheet do not contain an integration clause, nor are they signed by either party. Therefore, we cannot say that the written agreement was the entire agreement between the parties. Furthermore, while Pioneer sporadically paid commissions pursuant to the above written provisions for multiple years, the duration of the parties\u2019 agreement was never established.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">{\u00b6 16} In addition to failing to establish the duration of the agreement, we cannot say that Buckeye\u2019s evidence was credible. As noted above, Buckeye contended that it was entitled to a commission regardless of performing any activity that would benefit Pioneer. Furthermore, Dan Schlabach\u2019s testimony undermined the credibility of Buckeye. Schlabach, an independent businessman, testified that he had worked for a short period with Buckeye manufacturing playhouses. Schlabach noted that once his relationship with Buckeye ended, Buckeye continued to use the name of his products to market products they manufactured.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Schlabach\u2019s testimony, therefore, undermined the credibility of Buckeye\u2019s employees who testified about the business relationship with Pioneer.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">{\u00b6 17} Therefore, this court agrees with the trial court\u2019s determination that the parties lacked credibility because they routinely contradicted themselves and one another. Accordingly, we defer to the trial court\u2019s finding that the interested witnesses lacked credibility. See <em>State v. DeHass </em>(1967), 10 Ohio St.2d 230, 227 N.E.2d 212, paragraph one of the syllabus. The trial court had before it multiple accounts of what the parties\u2019 true agreement contained. None of those accounts appeared credible and as noted above, some of the interpretations offered do not support an actionable breach-of-contract claim. The evidence below was susceptible to multiple interpretations, favoring either party. Given the less-than-forthright testimony, we cannot say that the evidence weighed heavily in favor of Buckeye. The trial court\u2019s determination, therefore, that Buckeye failed to prove its case was not against the manifest weight of the evidence. Buckeye\u2019s sole assignment of error lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>Pioneer\u2019s Cross-Assignment of Error Number One</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">The trial court erred in finding that Pioneer Gazebo, Inc. did not have a right to exclusive use of the trade name/trademark \u201cPioneer Gazebos.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">{\u00b6 18} In its first cross-assignment of error, Pioneer has alleged that the trial court erred in finding that it did not prove that Pioneer had first used the term \u201cPioneer Gazebos.\u201d Specifically, Pioneer has alleged that it supplied an abundance of evidence that demonstrated that it was the first to use the trade name \u201cPioneer Gazebos.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">{\u00b6 19} While not providing a standard of review, Pioneer has effectively argued that the trial court\u2019s determination that it had not met its burden of proof was against the manifest weight of the evidence. Accordingly, we utilize such a standard of review as laid out above.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">{\u00b6 20} At issue in the instant matter is whether Pioneer demonstrated that it was in fact a prior user of the trade name \u201cPioneer Gazebos.\u201d The Ohio Supreme Court has held as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-8\">The rights in trademarks, trade names and service marks are acquired by actual user and not by registration. Such rights belong to the one who first actually adopts and uses the name or mark in connection with his business. * * * It is the actual use of the trade name, trademark or service mark in connection with the business and not the duration of such use which gives rise to legal rights. Thus, one who adopts and uses a name in connection with his business or products acquires the right to the use thereof over one who subsequently registers such name or mark. * * * The controlling question in cases of this nature is whether one has used a name, word, symbol or other means of identification in connection with his business in such manner that the public associates such name, etc., with a particular business or commodity so that the use by another is likely to create confusion in the mind of the public. Consequently, one having a prior use of such name, etc., is entitled to the use of such name, etc., to the exclusion of all others who wish to adopt it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b706-9\">(Citations omitted.) <em>Younker v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1963), 175 Ohio St. 1, 6-8, 23 O.O.2d 285, 191 N.E.2d 145. Pioneer has asserted that the undisputed evidence demonstrates that it was the first to use the term \u201cPioneer Gazebos\u201d to market its products. In denying Pioneer\u2019s claim for relief, the trial court held that \u201cit is unclear as to what the agreement was between the parties. Both sides have used the name \u2018Pioneer Gazebos.\u2019 \u201d Upon review of the evidence, the trial court\u2019s conclusion was not against the manifest weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-10\">{\u00b6 21} In support of its case, Pioneer relied upon the testimony of Dan Schlabach, Randy Collier, Charles Hunt, Edward Webber, Dan Steiner, and Paul <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>Swartzentruber. In rebuttal, Buckeye relied upon the testimony of David Champer, James Geiser, Jay Champer, and Mark Berens.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">{\u00b6 22} Schlabach testified that he had previously done business with Buckeye during which he manufactured playhouses that Buckeye sold. Schlabach testified that his business name was Little Cottage Company and that after his relationship with Buckeye ended, Buckeye continued to sell playhouses that were marketed as Little Cottages.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">{\u00b6 23} Collier\u2019s testimony, as noted above, focused solely upon Buckeye\u2019s breach-of-contract claim. Accordingly, it has no bearing on Pioneer\u2019s trade name causes of action. Likewise, Swartzentruber\u2019s rebuttal testimony focused solely upon the breach-of-contract claim. His testimony, therefore, also has no bearing on Pioneer\u2019s claim of prior use of the trade name. In addition, the testimony of Charles Hunt and Edward Webber was limited to demonstrating the damage and consumer confusion caused by Buckeye\u2019s use of the trade name \u201cPioneer Gazebos.\u201d Accordingly, their testimony also has no bearing on Pioneer\u2019s claim that it was a prior user of the trade name.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">{\u00b6 24} Dan Steiner, therefore, was the sole witness who testified for Pioneer on the issue of prior use. Steiner testified that he had developed the name \u201cPioneer Gazebos\u201d with his business partners and their wives. Steiner testified that the name was used prior to the first gazebo being built in June 1995. Steiner noted that he had sold a gazebo using the trade name \u201cPioneer Gazebos\u201d to Bud Mowery as early as 1995. We note that Mowery testified at the trial court hearing for the temporary restraining order, but did not testify at trial. In his earlier testimony, Mowery indicated that he referred to the gazebo as a \u201cPioneer Gazebo,\u201d but never indicated that it was marketed to him under that name. Rather, it is unclear whether Mowery used that term because he was purchasing a gazebo from Steiner\u2019s company then-named Pioneer Lawn Furniture or because the gazebo was marketed under that name.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-8\">{\u00b6 25} Steiner\u2019s testimony continued as follows. A bulk of literature, much of it produced by Buckeye, referred to Steiner\u2019s company as \u201cPioneer Gazebos.\u201d Order sheets, price sheets, and checks written by Buckeye to Pioneer included the term \u201cPioneer Gazebos.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b707-9\">{\u00b6 26} Dave Champer, the founder of Buckeye, testified for Buckeye as follows. Champer testified that he was the first to use the term \u201cPioneer Gazebos.\u201d He noted that Buckeye began marketing using the term as early as 1996. He supported his testimony by relying upon pricing sheets that Buckeye had created in 1996, which used the term \u201cPioneer Gazebos.\u201d He indicated that the name had not been used in 1995 because so few gazebos had been manufactured and even fewer had been sold.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>{\u00b6 27} James Geiser testified next for Buckeye. Geiser, Steiner\u2019s nephew, testified that he performed deliveries for Buckeye. He testified that he had overheard Steiner say, \u201cBoy, if Dave Champer knew what I was doing.\u201d He continued, noting that he believed that Steiner was referring to selling gazebos without paying a commission to Buckeye. Geiser concluded, stating that he had not always found his uncle to be truthful.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">{\u00b6 28} Buckeye\u2019s remaining witnesses, Jay Champer and Mark Berens, focused their testimony upon Buckeye\u2019s breach-of-contract claim. Therefore, their testimony has no bearing on Pioneer\u2019s trade-name cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">{\u00b6 29} Upon review of the evidence, we cannot say that the evidence weighed heavily in favor of Pioneer. Pioneer is correct that Steiner was the sole witness to contend that Pioneer had marketed to a consumer in 1995 using the name \u201cPioneer Gazebos.\u201d As noted above, however, Steiner\u2019s testimony was less than credible. He introduced no evidence at trial to support his claims that he marketed \u201cPioneer Gazebos\u201d in 1995. Furthermore, a bulk of the documentary evidence relied upon by Pioneer that uses the term was produced by Buckeye. We cannot conclude, as Pioneer has, that Buckeye writing a check to \u201cPioneer Gazebos\u201d supports Pioneer\u2019s cause of action. That evidence just as easily can be interpreted to support Buckeye\u2019s stance that it used the term \u201cPioneer Gazebos\u201d throughout the parties\u2019 business relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">{\u00b6 30} Accordingly, the trial court was left with conflicting testimonial evidence and inconclusive documentary evidence. This court, therefore, cannot say that this is the exceptional case in which the evidence weighed heavily in favor of Pioneer. The trial court\u2019s determination that Pioneer had not met its burden was not against the manifest weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-8\">{\u00b6 31} We recognize that such a result leaves the public with two entities marketing \u201cPioneer Gazebos.\u201d While obviously not an ideal result, it is compelled by the record. Like the trial court, we cannot find that either party offered credible evidence regarding the first use in commerce of the term \u201cPioneer Gazebos.\u201d We urge the parties to reach a resolution that is in the best interest of the public, but on the record before us, we cannot compel them to do so. Since this matter has been tried on its merits and is res judicata, only the parties can bring a rational solution to their tangled business affairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-9\">{\u00b6 32} Pioneer\u2019s first cross-assignment of error lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-10\">Pioneer\u2019s Cross-Assignment of Error Number Two</p>\n<p id=\"A-Y\">The trial court erred in denying injunctive relief pursuant to Pioneer Gazebo Inc.\u2019s first claim for relief under the Ohio Deceptive Trade Practices Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>{\u00b6 33} In its second cross-assignment of error, Pioneer has argued that the trial court erred in failing to find that Buckeye had engaged in deceptive trade practices. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">{\u00b6 34} R.C. 4165.02 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-6\">(A) A person engages in a deceptive trade practice when, in the course of the person\u2019s business * * * the person does any of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-7\">(1) Passes off goods or services as those of another;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-8\">(2) Causes likelihood of confusion or misunderstanding as to the source, sponsorship, approval, or certification of goods or services;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-9\">(3) Causes likelihood of confusion or misunderstanding as to affiliation, connection, or association with, or certification by, another.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b709-10\">In its argument, Pioneer asserts that the trial court erred when it failed to find that Buckeye violated the above provisions. Specifically, Pioneer asserts that it presented evidence that Buckeye was using photographs of gazebos manufactured by Steiner\u2019s company and using the name \u201cPioneer Gazebos\u201d to market inferior gazebos and that Buckeye had engaged in a form of \u201ccybersquatting.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AAI\">{\u00b6 35} As noted above, the trial court did not err in finding that Pioneer had not proven that it was entitled to exclusive use of the name \u201cPioneer Gazebos.\u201d Accordingly, the use of that name by Buckeye cannot form the basis of a deceptive trade practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-11\">{\u00b6 36} The remainder of Pioneer\u2019s claims suffers from the same deficiency as its claim of first prior use. Its claims are solely supported by the testimony of Steiner. In turn, they are rebutted by the testimony of numerous Buckeye witnesses. While Steiner contends that Buckeye is using pictures of his gazebos to market inferior gazebos, Buckeye contends that it has engaged in no such activity. While Steiner contends that the documentary evidence clearly established Pioneer\u2019s claim, we cannot reach such a conclusion. Assuming arguendo that Buckeye\u2019s website contained pictures of gazebos that were manufactured by Steiner\u2019s company, there is no evidence that Buckeye was using these pictures to deceive customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-12\">{\u00b6 37} Furthermore, while not pleaded by Pioneer, we note that any claim that the photographs themselves are copyrighted material must also fail. While Steiner asserted that he had taken the photographs, Buckeye employees countered that they had taken the photos. In addition, to the extent that Steiner may have taken the photographs, he conceded that he authorized Buckeye to use them <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>to market his gazebos. As noted above, evidence was presented that the photographs were being used for that purpose. As such, Pioneer failed to meet its burden with respect to a cause of action related to the use of the photographs.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">{\u00b6 88} Accordingly, there is some competent, credible evidence to support the trial court\u2019s finding that Buckeye had not engaged in deceptive trade practices. See <em>Bell, </em>9th Dist. No. 20705, 2002 WL 533399, at *2. Therefore, Pioneer failed to meet its burden in demonstrating by a preponderance of the evidence that Buckeye had engaged in deceptive trade practices. Pioneer\u2019s second cross-assignment of error, therefore, lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">Pioneer\u2019s Cross-Assignment of Error Number Three</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">The trial court erred in denying injunctive relief upon Pioneer Gazebo Inc.\u2019s second claim for relief under the Ohio common law claim for unfair trade practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-10\">{\u00b6 39} In its final cross-assignment of error, Pioneer has argued that the trial court erred in finding that it was not entitled to injunctive relief under common law. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-11\">{\u00b6 40} Pioneer\u2019s final claim is predicated upon a finding that it is entitled to the sole use of the term \u201cPioneer Gazebos.\u201d As we held above, the trial court did not err in finding that Pioneer had not proven that it was entitled to that exclusive use. Accordingly, its unfair trade practices common law claim was properly denied by the trial court. Pioneer\u2019s third cross-assignment of error lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-12\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b710-13\">{\u00b6 41} Buckeye\u2019s sole assignment of error is overruled. Pioneer\u2019s three cross-assignments of error are overruled.
