First, they contend that the trial court erred in finding that the school district may use an express easement for a \u201cstormwater outfall sewer\u201d to drain the treated wastewater. Second, they claim that the trial court erred in finding no unlawful taking of their property as a matter of law. Third, they argue that the trial court erred in finding the school board immune from liability on claims of nuisance and trespass. Fourth, they assert that the trial court erred in finding the existence of an implied easement allowing the school district to drain the treated wastewater.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-10\">{\u00b6 3} For the reasons set forth below, we believe the trial court erred in finding, as a matter of law, that the school district\u2019s drainage of treated wastewater across the Gabels\u2019 property fits within the scope of an express easement for a \u201cstormwater outfall sewer.\u201d The language of the express easement does not unambiguously permit the school district to drain treated wastewater across the Gabels\u2019 property. To the contrary, the easement contains language limiting its use to \u201cStorm Sewer purposes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b645-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>{\u00b6 4} Moreover, we find a triable issue of fact as to whether the drainage of treated wastewater on the Gabels\u2019 property was permissible because it imposed no additional burden on their land.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">{\u00b6 5} We also conclude that the trial court erred in finding the existence of an implied easement to drain the treated wastewater across the Gabels\u2019 property. Although the school board alleges the existence of an implied easement by estoppel, we are unpersuaded that the Gabels took any actions that estop them from disclaiming the existence of an easement to drain the treated wastewater.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">{\u00b6 6} Despite the foregoing conclusions, we agree with the trial court\u2019s determination that the Miami East School Board is immune from liability under R.C. 2744.02, as a matter of law, on the Gabels\u2019 nuisance and trespass claims. Therefore, the Gabels cannot prevail on these tort claims regardless of whether an easement authorizes the discharge of treated wastewater across their property-</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">{\u00b6 7} Finally, we conclude that the trial court erred in entering summary judgment against the Gabels on their mandamus claim alleging a taking of their property without just compensation. A trier of fact reasonably could find that the disputed drainage of treated wastewater across the Gabels\u2019 property is unauthorized and that it qualifies as a substantial or unreasonable interference with their property rights. Accordingly, the judgment of the Miami County Common Pleas Court is affirmed in part and reversed in part, and the cause is remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-8\">I. Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b645-9\">{\u00b6 8} The Miami East School District long ago began operating a wastewater treatment facility on property located adjacent to land the Gabels now own. In 1958, a prior owner of the Gabels\u2019 land, Clark S. Bair, granted the school district an easement to \u201clay and perpetually maintain, operate, repair and remove a sewer fine over and through [his] farm.\u201d The 1958 easement provided for the sewer fine to be \u201claid in a direct fine to Little Lost Creek.\u201d In accordance with this easement, the school district operated a 10,000-gallon wastewater facility for more than 40 years and discharged treated effluent through the sewer line and directly into the creek.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-10\">{\u00b6 9} In 1998, Jeffrey and Pamela Bair, who then owned the Bair property, granted the school district a second easement \u201cfor the installation, maintenance, repair, and replacement of a stormwater outfall sewer on, in, or under\u201d their property. The 1998 easement stated that it was \u201cfor Storm Sewer purposes\u201d and to provide \u201cingress and egress, maintenance and repair of a storm sewer outlet from the adjacent Miami East Board of Education property.\u201d Unlike the 1958 easement, the 1998 easement did not specify that it was to drain directly into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>Little Lost Creek. Instead, the water was to drain onto a low-lying portion of the Bair property a short distance from the creek into which it ultimately would flow.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">{\u00b6 10} Shortly after obtaining the 1998 easement, the school district approved resurfacing of a high school track on its property and the installation of a stormwater drainage system around the track. This work included the placement of a small drain on the Bair property using the 1998 easement. Thereafter, in 2003, the school district began budding an elementary school on its property. The project included a new stormwater drainage system around the school, and it required the placement of a 36-inch cement drain on the Bair property under the 1998 easement.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">{\u00b6 11} In conjunction with the foregoing construction project, the school district also built a new 25,000-gallon wastewater treatment facility on its land to replace the existing 10,000-gallon plant. The school district designed the new facility to discharge into a storm sewer on school property. From there, the treated effluent was to flow onto the Bair property through the stormwater outfall sewer that had been installed pursuant to the 1998 easement. The school district began using the new wastewater treatment facility in May 2004 and discontinued using its older facility at that time. Since then, the school district has used the 1958 sewer-line easement \u201conly as a secondary stormwater outlet.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">{\u00b6 12} The Gabels purchased the Bair property on August 18, 2004. They did not immediately notice that the school district was using the 1998 easement to drain stormwater and treated wastewater onto their property. A few weeks after buying the property, however, the Gabels discovered \u201ca large amount of murky water\u201d flowing from a drain pipe on their land. The water was located near Little Lost Creek in an area \u201ccovered by a large amount of underbrush\u201d that Thomas Gabel had to \u201chack away\u201d to find. The affected area allegedly includes several acres of the Gabels\u2019 property, which remains \u201ccontinually] saturated\u201d due to treated wastewater being discharged there.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">{\u00b6 13} The Gabels objected to the school district about the drainage of treated wastewater onto their property in December 2004. In response, the school district took the position that the drainage was permitted under the 1998 easement that it had obtained from Jeffrey and Pamela Bair. The dispute ultimately resulted in the Gabels filing a five-count verified complaint against the Miami East School District Board of Education. Count one alleged that the drainage of treated wastewater on their property was not permitted under the 1998 easement and constituted a taking of their property without just compensation. As a result, the Gabels sought a writ of mandamus directing the school board to pay them for the taking. Counts two and three set forth tort claims of trespass and nuisance based on an allegation that the drainage of wastewater on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>their property was not authorized by the 1998 easement. Count four alleged a violation of Ohio\u2019s public-records law based on the school board\u2019s failure to provide their attorney with certain information. Count five sought a preliminary injunction preventing further damage to the Gabels\u2019 property. The Gabels later dismissed counts four and five, however, leaving only the two tort claims and the takings issue remaining.</p>\n<p id=\"AgK\">{\u00b6 14} The school board subsequently moved for summary judgment. In support, it argued that it was immune from tort liability. It also maintained that the school district possessed a valid express easement and/or an easement by estoppel permitting the discharge of treated wastewater onto the Gabels\u2019 land. Finally, the school board asserted that the drainage of treated wastewater under the 1998 easement did not constitute a compensable taking.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">{\u00b6 15} In a November 23, 2005 decision and entry, the trial court agreed with the school board\u2019s arguments. It found that the school board was immune from tort liability under R.C. 2744.02. It also found that the Gabels\u2019 tort claims failed because the drainage of wastewater onto their property was permitted under the terms of the 1998 easement. The trial court additionally determined that the school district possessed an easement by estoppel permitting the drainage of treated wastewater across the 1998 easement. With regard to the takings issue, the trial court found that the land at issue had no economically viable use regardless of whether the school district drained treated wastewater on it. The trial court reached this conclusion because the low-lying area was covered with underbrush and located behind a football stadium near a creek where it already was subjected to the drainage of stormwater pursuant to the 1998 easement. Thus, the trial court reasoned that the additional drainage of treated wastewater in the area had no impact on the Gabels\u2019 ability to use the land. This timely appeal followed the trial court\u2019s entry of summary judgment against the Gabels.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b647-8\">{\u00b6 16} In their first assignment of error, the Gabels contend the trial court erred in finding that the 1998 easement authorized the school district to discharge treated wastewater onto their property. The Gabels argue that the 1998 easement is expressly limited to the discharge of stormwater.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-9\">{\u00b6 17} In reaching a contrary conclusion, the trial court reasoned:</p>\n<p id=\"b647-10\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cThe Gabels\u2019 contention that the Board cannot use the 1998 easement with the wastewater treatment plant is without merit. The easement is for the installation and maintenance of a storm sewer outfall or drain. (See Ex. A-l, attached to Defendant\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment). There are no expressed instructions or limitations upon the use of that outfall. (Id.) The use of the outfall for treated wastewater drainage is not inconsistent with the use of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>stormwater outfall drain. The Gabels are simply arguing over the type of water being drained. There is no evidence of any non-compliance with the easement or EPA guidelines and permit requirements. There is no evidence of any environmental hazards, and there is no evidence which would indicate that the processed wastewater is any less clean than unprocessed stormwater. The Court makes no differentiation between unprocessed stormwater and processed wastewater.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">{\u00b6 19} Upon review, we find the foregoing analysis to be unpersuasive. As noted above, the 1998 easement states that it is \u201cfor the installation, maintenance, repair, and replacement of a stormwater outfall sewer on, in, or under\u201d their property. The easement also specifies that it is \u201cfor Storm Sewer purposes\u201d and to provide \u201cingress and egress, maintenance and repair of a storm sewer outlet from the adjacent Miami East Board of Education property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">{\u00b6 20} \u201cStormwater\u201d is commonly defined as \u201can abnormal amount of surface water due to a heavy rain or snowstorm.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> An \u201coutfall\u201d is \u201c[t]he place where a sewer, drain, or stream discharges.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A \u201csewer\u201d is \u201c[a]n artificial, usually underground conduit for carrying off sewage or rainwater.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> With these definitions in mind, we believe a reasonable reading of the 1998 easement is that it was granted to the school district for purposes of transporting rain or snow-related surface water (or \u201cstormwater\u201d) through an underground conduit (or \u201csewer\u201d) to a discharge point (or \u201coutfall\u201d) on the Gabels\u2019 property. Because the 1998 easement specifies that it is for \u201cStorm Sewer purposes,\u201d we cannot agree with the trial court\u2019s finding that there are no limitations imposed on its use. In our view, the school district\u2019s use of the 1998 easement to discharge treated wastewater, in addition to stormwater, onto the Gabels\u2019 property exceeded the express terms of the easement. Although the school board contends that the 1998 easement does not preclude the drainage of wastewater through the stormwater outfall sewer, we find this argument to be without merit. The most reasonable interpretation of a \u201cstormwater outfall sewer\u201d easement for \u201cStorm Sewer purposes\u201d is that it is limited to drainage of stormwater.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b649-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>{\u00b6 21} Unfortunately, the foregoing conclusion does not end our analysis of the easement issue. In its ruling, the trial court also correctly observed that the Ohio Supreme Court has approved new, nonspecified uses for express easements when those uses impose no additional burden on the servient estate. In <em>Friedman Transfer &amp; Const. Co. v. Youngstown </em>(1964), 176 Ohio St. 209, 27 O.O.2d 91, 198 N.E.2d 661, for example, the court reviewed an easement granted to the government for the construction of a bridge. After the bridge had been completed, the government sought to install a water pipeline on it. Although the easement did not provide for the placement of a pipeline, the <em>Friedman </em>court concluded that it could be installed, without any compensation to the landowner, because it imposed no additional burden on the servient estate. Subsequently, in <em>Ziegler v. Ohio Water Serv. Co. </em>(1969), 18 Ohio St.2d 101, 47 O.O.2d 244, 247 N.E.2d 728, the court reviewed an easement granted to the government for highway purposes. The <em>Ziegler </em>court held that an underground water pipeline could be installed on the easement, again without compensation to the landowner, because the pipeline imposed no additional burden on the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-4\">{\u00b6 22} Thereafter, in <em>Jolliff v. Hardin Cable Television Co. </em>(1971), 26 Ohio St.2d 103, 55 O.O.2d 203, 269 N.E.2d 588, the court held that an easement granted to a power company \u201cfor the purpose of transmitting electric or other power\u201d also could be used to run cable television lines across the grantor\u2019s property. In reaching this conclusion, the court noted that running cable television lines was similar to the use specified in the easement and that it imposed no additional burden on the servient estate. The <em>Jolliff </em>court also cited <em>Friedman </em>and <em>Ziegler, </em>observing that in both cases \u201cthe added uses, construction and maintenance of pipelines,\u201d were permitted despite the fact that they \u201cwere of an entirely different nature than the highway-purpose uses which were specified in the original grants.\u201d <em>Jolliff, </em>26 Ohio St.2d at 108, 55 O.O.2d 203, 269 N.E.2d 588; see, also, <em>Centel Cable Television Co. v. Cook </em>(1991), 58 Ohio St.3d 8, 12, 567 N.E.2d 1010 (relying on <em>Friedman, Ziegler, </em>and <em>Jolliff </em>to hold that \u201cthe stringing of coaxial cable by a cable television company along an easement owned by a public utility constitutes no additional burden to the owner of the servient estate\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>{\u00b6 28} Relying on the foregoing line of cases, the trial court concluded that the drainage of wastewater on the Gabels\u2019 property under the 1998 easement was permissible, as a matter of law, because it imposed no additional burden on their land. In reaching this conclusion, the trial court reasoned as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">{\u00b6 24} \u201cThe question in the case sub judice is not whether the wastewater treatment plant adds additional water to the Gabels\u2019 property. The question is whether the additional water imposes a substantial additional burden on the Gabels\u2019 use of the property. The [School] Board has two valid easements over the Gabels\u2019 property. One is for the installation of a stormwater sewer outlet, and the other is for a sewer line. The consolidation of the purified water and the stormwater through one outfall actually means that the school is not draining water onto the Gabels\u2019 property in two places. The water from the treatment plant does not make the natural drainway on the Gabels\u2019 property any less usable than it was with stormwater drainage. The Court has reviewed the photographs taken before and after the plant was operative. (See photographs attached as Ex. A-3 and A-4 to Defendant\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment). The Court finds that the wastewater treatment plant has not imposed any additional burden on the Gabels\u2019 property. The property sits in a ravine and the Gabels have no evidence that there is any way they can use the property with only stormwater drained onto the property that is not available to them with the addition of clean, treated water. The Court finds that there has been no injury to the Gabels\u2019 premises in the way of hindering access thereto, particularly in light of the nature of the property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">{\u00b6 25} Although the issue is perhaps a close one, we believe that the trial court erred in finding, as a matter of law, that the discharge of treated wastewater on the Gabels\u2019 property under the 1998 easement imposed no additional burden on their land. Construing the evidence in a light most favorable to the Gabels, as we must in the context of summary judgment, we believe that a trier of fact reasonably might find otherwise. In its ruling, the trial court noted that the school district held two easements over the Gabels\u2019 land: the 1958 easement, which indisputably provided for the drainage of treated wastewater, and the 1998 easement, which was for storm sewer purposes. The trial court reasoned that no additional burden resulted from the school district\u2019s decision to discontinue using the 1958 easement and to drain treated wastewater <em>and </em>stormwater onto the Gabels\u2019 property under the 1998 easement.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">{\u00b6 26} If the drain pipes installed under both easements discharged directly into the creek on the Gabels\u2019 land, we would be inclined to agree with the trial court\u2019s analysis. As noted above, however, the drain pipe installed under the 1958 easement discharges directly into the creek, whereas the pipe installed under the 1998 easement discharges onto a low-lying portion of the Gabels\u2019 land <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>near the creek but not directly into it. As a result, the Gabels aver that the drainage of both treated wastewater and stormwater using the 1998 easement has resulted in a considerable amount of standing water on their property that would not exist if the 1998 easement were used solely for stormwater purposes. In support of this proposition, Thomas Gabel provided the trial court with an affidavit in which he averred that several acres of his property are affected by the school district\u2019s use of the 1998 easement to drain treated wastewater. He averred that the area is continually saturated and that it contains a \u201clarge amount of murky water.\u201d The Gabels also provided the trial court with a videotape of the area. Among other things, it shows a large pool of water in a wooded portion of their land. Finally, the Gabels provided the trial court with an affidavit from David Winemiller, a licensed engineer and land surveyor. Winemiller averred:</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">{\u00b6 27} \u201ca. The added use of the wastewater treatment plant that utilizes the storm water fallout sewer by the Miami East School Board creates an extreme amount of water. The volume of water is attributable to the volume of water generated by the wastewater treatment plant operated by the Miami East School Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">{\u00b6 28} \u201cb. The continual use of the wastewater treatment plant by the Miami East School Board creates a substantial burden on the Gabels\u2019 property. The wastewater remains in a stagnant pool on the Gabels\u2019 property and fails to drain directly into Lost Creek.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">{\u00b6 29} \u201cc. If the wastewater treatment plant were not being operated by the Miami East School Board, then the amount of water on the Gabels\u2019 property would be significantly less.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">{\u00b6 30} In light of the foregoing evidence, we believe that a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether the drainage of wastewater under the 1998 easement imposes an additional burden on the Gabels\u2019 land beyond the burden created by using the easement for stormwater purposes. As a result, the school board was not entitled to summary judgment on the basis that the drainage of wastewater under the 1998 easement imposed no additional burden and, therefore, was permissible despite the fact that it was not specifically authorized under the terms of the easement.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-9\">{\u00b6 31} We turn next to the trial court\u2019s alternative finding that the school district held an implied easement by estoppel permitting it to use the 1998 stormwater outfall sewer for the drainage of wastewater. In support, the trial court reasoned:</p>\n<p id=\"b651-10\">{\u00b6 32} \u201cThe [School] Board relied upon the easement to build the wastewater treatment plant on the Bairs\u2019 property line. All were aware at the time of the creation of the easement that the Board would be developing the property. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>use of the stormwater outfall for the wastewater treatment plant was open and obvious before the Gabels purchased the property. Additionally, the Supreme Court has held that the principle of caveat emptor applies to sales of real estate relative to observable conditions. <em>Layman v. Binns, </em>35 Ohio St.3d 176 [519 N.E.2d 642] (1988). This means that the Board has an implied easement to use the stormwater outfall with the wastewater treatment plant, and the Gabels are estopped from arguing otherwise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\"> {\u00b6 33} Upon review, we disagree with the trial court\u2019s analysis. \u201c \u2018One claiming an easement by estoppel must establish (1) misrepresentation or fraudulent failure to speak and (2) reasonable detrimental reliance.\u2019\u201d <em>Maloney v. Patterson </em>(1989), 63 Ohio App.3d 405, 410, 579 N.E.2d 230, quoting Bruce &amp; Ely, The Law of Easements and Licenses in Land (1988), Section 6.01. We note, however, that \u201c \u2018[c]ourts are reluctant to find an easement by estoppel on the basis of \u201cmere passive acquiescence.\u201d Nonetheless, under certain circumstances, equity imposes an obligation to disclose information regarding the existence or location of an easement. Such a duty may be found when the servient estate owner observes the claimant improving the servient estate, but not usually when the servient estate owner stands by while the claimant improves his own property, the alleged dominant estate. Furthermore, there is authority that an obligation to speak does not arise when a claimant is already in possession of the relevant information.\u2019 \u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">{\u00b6 34} Consistent with the trial court\u2019s findings, the school board argues that an easement by estoppel arose when Jeffrey and Pamela Bair, the former owners of the property, remained silent and watched the School District expend funds to build a new school and wastewater treatment facility in anticipation of using the 1998 easement to drain treated wastewater across their property. Thus, the school board asserts that the Bairs failed to speak out against the planned use of the 1998 easement to drain treated wastewater and that the school district detrimentally relied on their silence.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">{\u00b6 35} The problem with the estoppel argument is that nothing in the record establishes the Bairs\u2019 <em>knowledge </em>of the school district\u2019s intent to use the 1998 easement to drain treated wastewater prior to completion of the construction project. Although the building of the new school and wastewater treatment facility was public knowledge, Jeffrey and Pamela Bair both averred that no one from the Miami East School District ever approached them about using the 1998 easement for wastewater drainage purposes. Moreover, at the time of the construction project, the school district already held a 1958 easement for the drainage of treated wastewater across the Bairs\u2019 property at a different location. Consequently, it would have been reasonable for the Bairs to assume that the School District would continue to use this easement for the drainage of treated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>wastewater from the new facility. Indeed, even the school board\u2019s own expert, Ohio EPA environmental specialist Joseph Reynolds, opined that during the permitting process, he believed the new wastewater treatment facility would drain through the old system. In any event, nothing in the plans for the project showed the new facility draining onto the Bairs\u2019 property using the 1998 easement, and nothing in the record demonstrates the Bairs\u2019 knowledge of any such intent. As a result, their silence in the face of the construction project does not support the existence of an easement by estoppel.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Therefore, the trial court erred in entering summary judgment in favor of the school board on the basis that the school district held an implied easement to drain treated wastewater using the 1998 stormwater outfall sewer.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">{\u00b6 36} Our analysis up to this point is somewhat academic, however, in light of our agreement with the trial court\u2019s additional finding that the school board is immune from liability on the Gabels\u2019 claims of nuisance and trespass. Under R.C. 2744.02(A)(1), political subdivisions are immune from tort liability \u201callegedly caused by any act or omission of the political subdivision or an employee of the political subdivision in connection with a governmental or proprietary function.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This broad grant of immunity is subject to five exceptions set forth in R.C. 2744.02(B). The second of these exceptions is at issue here. It provides that political subdivisions are liable for \u201closs to person or property caused by the negligent performance of acts by their employees with respect to proprietary functions of the political subdivisions.\u201d R.C. 2744.02(B)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">{\u00b6 37} The issue in the present case is whether the Gabels\u2019 tort claims of nuisance and trespass arise from the negligent performance of a proprietary function by school district employees. Based on our review of the record, we find no evidence to support such a conclusion. Under R.C. 2744.01(C)(2)(i), the design, installation, or construction of a sewer system is classified as a governmental function. On the other hand, R.C. 2744.01(G)(2)(d) provides that the maintenance or operation of a sewer system is a proprietary function. On appeal, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>the Gabels argue that their nuisance and trespass claims are grounded in the negligent performance of a propriety function, namely, the School District\u2019s operation of its new wastewater treatment facility. They assert that the new plant is being operated in a way that results in the unauthorized drainage of wastewater on their property at the site of the 1998 stormwater easement.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">{\u00b6 38} Upon review, we find no error in the trial court\u2019s determination that the school board is immune from liability on the Gabels\u2019 tort claims. The trial court properly noted that the school board has immunity insofar as the tort claims might be read as arising from the design of the new wastewater treatment facility. Because the design of the facility is a governmental function under R.C. 2744.01(C)(2)(l), the immunity exception set forth in R.C. 2744.02(B)(2) would have no applicability.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">{\u00b6 39} As noted above, however, the Gabels contend that their tort claims involve the negligent operation of the new wastewater treatment facility, which has resulted in the unauthorized discharge of water on their property. If the record contained evidence establishing negligent operation of the plant by school district employees, we would find the Gabels\u2019 argument to be persuasive. But the record is devoid of evidence linking the excess water on their property to <em>negligence </em>in the operation of the wastewater treatment facility. To the contrary, the record reflects that the facility is being operated exactly as planned and intended. The plant was specifically designed to discharge treated wastewater onto the Gabels\u2019 property at the site of the 1998 stormwater easement, and that is precisely what is happening. Thus, we find no genuine issue of material fact as to whether the excess wastewater on the Gabels\u2019 property is attributable to the negligent operation of the new wastewater treatment facility.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">{\u00b6 40} Because the discharge of treated wastewater on the Gabels\u2019 property was the intended result of the School District\u2019s actions, R.C. 2744.02(B)(2)does not apply. As set forth above, that provision removes the shield immunity when harm results from the negligent performance of a proprietary function. Absent evidence of such negligence, political subdivision immunity remains intact. See, e.g., <em>Thayer v. W. Carrollton Bd. of Edn., </em>Montgomery App. No. 20063, 2004-Ohio-3921, 2004 WL 1662198, \u00b6 14 (recognizing that the exceptions to immunity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>found in R.C. 2744.02(B) apply \u201cwhere injury results from negligence\u201d rather than intentional acts); <em>Reno v. Centerville, </em>Montgomery App. No. 20078, 2004-Ohio-781, 2004 WL 316512, \u00b6 51 (observing that political subdivisions are immune from liability for intentional tort claims for trespass). Consequently, we find no error in the trial court\u2019s entry of summary judgment against the Gabels on their tort claims alleging nuisance and trespass. The school board is immune from liability on these claims under R.C. 2744.02, and we find no genuine issue of material fact as to whether a statutory exception applies. Therefore, the Gabels cannot prevail on the tort claims regardless of whether the 1998 easement authorized the discharge of treated wastewater across their property.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">{\u00b6 41} The final issue before us is whether the trial court erred in entering summary judgment against the Gabels on their mandamus claim alleging a taking of their property without just compensation. \u201cThe United States and Ohio Constitutions guarantee that private property shall not be taken for public use without just compensation.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Elsass v. Shelby Cty. Bd. Of Commrs. </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 529, 533, 751 N.E.2d 1032. \u201cIn order to establish a taking, a landowner must demonstrate a substantial or unreasonable interference with a property right. Such an interference may involve the actual physical taking of real property, or it may include the deprivation of an intangible interest in the premises.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State ex rel. OTR v. Columbus </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 203, 206, 667 N.E.2d 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">{\u00b6 42} The Ohio Supreme Court has recognized that \u201c \u2018[t]he value of property consists in the owner\u2019s absolute right of dominion, use, and disposition for every lawful purpose. This necessarily excludes the power of others from exercising any dominion, use or disposition over it. Hence, any physical interference by another, with the owner\u2019s use and enjoyment of his property, is a taking to that extent.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 207, 667 N.E.2d 8, quoting <em>Mansfield v. Balliett </em>(1902), 65 Ohio St. 451, 63 N.E. 86; see, also, <em>Smith v. Erie R. Co. </em>(1938), 134 Ohio St. 135, 142, 11 O.O. 571, 16 N.E.2d 310 (recognizing that \u201c[i]n Ohio * * * compensation has been allowed * * * for the easting of extraneous and annoying substances on the owner\u2019s land\u201d); <em>State ex rel.

Carney </em>(1958), 167 Ohio St. 416, 5 O.O.2d 63, 149 N.E.2d 238, the court concluded that a viable takings claim existed when the construction of a public improvement on county property greatly increased the flow of water on the plaintiffs property. The <em>Lucas </em>court held:</p>\n<p id=\"b655-8\">{\u00b6 44} \u201cWhere, in creating a public improvement upon land which it owns, a county without negligence or malice but solely as a result of the creation of such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>improvement physically encroaches upon the land and property of another owner and deprives that owner of any of the use and enjoyment of his property, such encroachment is a taking pro tanto of the property so encroached upon, for which the county is liable, and the owner of such property is entitled to institute an action and have a jury impaneled to determine the compensation due him from the county for the appropriation pro tanto of his property.\u201d Id., syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">{\u00b6 45} Likewise, in <em>Masley v. Lorain </em>(1976), 48 Ohio St.2d 334, 2 O.O.3d 463, 358 N.E.2d 596, the court recognized that any direct encroachment on land subjecting it to a public use that restricts the owner\u2019s dominion and control over the land constitutes a taking. In <em>Masley, </em>which also involved the drainage of water across the plaintiffs\u2019 property, the court concluded:</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">{\u00b6 46} \u201cThe construction and operation of a municipal storm sewer system so as to cause material damage to a downstream landowner, as a result of flooding from rains or other causes which are reasonably foreseeable, is a direct encroachment upon that land which subjects it to a public use that excludes or restricts the landowner\u2019s dominion and control over his land, and such owner has a right to compensation for the property taken under Section 19, Article I of the Ohio Constitution.\u201d Id., syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">{\u00b6 47} The foregoing cases illustrate that one of the fundamental attributes of land ownership is the right to exclude others from use of the land. They also establish that when the government\u2019s unauthorized encroachment on private land interferes with the owner\u2019s use and enjoyment of his property, a potential takings claim arises. In the present case, however, the trial court concluded that no taking occurred, as a matter of law, despite the school district\u2019s discharge of treated wastewater on the Gabels\u2019 property, because the evidence failed to establish any \u201ceconomically viable use\u201d for the land. In support, the trial court reasoned:</p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">{\u00b6 48} \u201cThe Gabels acknowledge that the Board\u2019s use of the easement for purposes of stormwater drainage was and is lawful. (See Complaint, \u00b6 17.) Accordingly, the Gabels must demonstrate that there is an economically viable use of the property, in light of the Board\u2019s right to drain stormwater on the property, in light of the fact that the property is covered with underbrush, in light of the fact that the property sits in a low lying area behind a football stadium and is shown to have had a history of flooding, and in light of the fact that the property borders Lost Creek. The Court finds that flooding is flooding, whether it is stormwater drainage flooding or wastewater treatment plant flooding. The Gabels\u2019 bare assertion that the property is currently useless, is insufficient to meet their burden of showing that it is the wastewater treatment plant that causes it to be useless.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b656-8\">{\u00b6 49} On appeal, the school board similarly argues that the Gabels cannot establish a taking without evidence that the drainage of treated wastewater on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>their land interferes with \u201csome economically viable use of their property.\u201d Because the record fails to show that the wooded area at issue had any economically viable use, the school board contends it cannot be liable for a taking.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">{\u00b6 50} Upon review, we disagree with the trial court\u2019s analysis and the school board\u2019s argument. It is true that a taking may exist when government action deprives a property owner of <em>some, </em>or in certain cases <em>all, </em>economically viable use of his land. See <em>State ex rel. BSW Dev. Group v. Dayton, </em>83 Ohio St.3d 338, 699 N.E.2d 1271 (1998) (recognizing that in cases involving regulatory takings, a landowner must prove the deprivation of all economically viable uses of his land); <em>State ex rel. Elsass, </em>92 Ohio St.3d at 535, 751 N.E.2d 1032 (observing that in nonregulatory takings cases, the deprivation of any economically viable use of land is sufficient to constitute a taking).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">{\u00b6 51} It is also true, however, that the government sometimes takes property that has no \u201ceconomically viable use\u201d other than for private residential purposes.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The school board\u2019s argument suggests that portions of the Gabels\u2019 residential land may be taken for public use, without any compensation being paid, because the land has no other economically viable use. We do not agree. Under the school board\u2019s theory, it could flood the Gabels\u2019 wooded property completely, or possibly even confiscate the land outright, because it has no \u201ceconomically viable use\u201d anyway. But the existence of economic viability, a concept that traditionally has applied in regulatory takings cases, cannot be the linchpin of takings analysis in all cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">{\u00b6 52} To the contrary, as the cases cited above make clear, a compensable taking is established if a landowner simply demonstrates a substantial or unreasonable interference with a property right. These rights include the owner\u2019s absolute right of dominion, use, and disposition of his property for every lawful purpose. It includes the right to exclude others from exercising any dominion, use, or disposition over it. As a result, \u201c \u2018any physical interference by another, with the owner\u2019s use and enjoyment of his property, is a taking to that extent.\u2019 \u201d <em>State ex rel. OTR, </em>76 Ohio St.3d at 207, 667 N.E.2d 8, quoting <em>Mansfield v. Balliett </em>(1902), 65 Ohio St. 451, 63 N.E. 86. This is particularly true in cases involving the physical invasion of private property through flooding caused by public improvements. <em>State ex rel. Elsass, </em>92 Ohio St.3d at 536, fn. 1, 751 N.E.2d 1032.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-8\">{\u00b6 53} In the present case, the Gabels\u2019 intended use and enjoyment of their land might consist of nothing more than taking leisurely walks through their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>woods. To the extent that the school district\u2019s discharge of treated wastewater creates pools of stagnant water and flooding that otherwise would not exist, a trier of fact reasonably might find interference with the Gabels\u2019 right to the exclusive dominion and control over their property. As noted above, the Gabels have averred that the drainage of both treated wastewater and stormwater using the 1998 easement has resulted in a considerable amount of standing water on their property that would not exist if the 1998 easement were used solely for stormwater purposes. In particular, Thomas Gabel provided the trial court with an affidavit in which he stated that <em>several acres </em>of his property are affected by the school district\u2019s use of the 1998 easement to drain treated wastewater. Moreover, engineer David Winemiller averred that use of the 1998 easement to drain treated wastewater across the Gabels\u2019 land has resulted in a \u201cstagnant pool\u201d and an \u201cextreme amount of water\u201d on the property. In his view, the amount of standing water on the Gabels\u2019 land would be \u201csignificantly less\u201d if the new wastewater treatment plant were not being discharged at the site of the 1998 easement. In light of this evidence, we find a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the discharge of treated wastewater, if ultimately found to be unauthorized,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> has resulted in a compensable taking. Finally, we find no merit in the school board\u2019s argument that no taking can exist because the Gabels continue to own the land at issue. The school board cites no authority for the proposition that it must assert actual ownership of the land for a taking to occur. As the case law cited herein makes clear, a taking can arise if a property owner demonstrates interference with a property right, including the right to exclusive use and enjoyment of his land.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">{\u00b6 54} Based on the reasoning set forth above, the judgment of the Miami County Common Pleas Court is hereby affirmed in part and reversed in part, and the cause is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">Judgment affirmed in part and reversed in part, and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b658-8\">Brogan and Wolff, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b659-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>Anthony Valen, J., retired, of the Twelfth District Court of Appeals, sitting by assignment.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b648-7\">.

Even assuming, arguendo, that the 1998 easement was ambiguous with regard to the school board's right to drain treated wastewater onto the Gabels\u2019 property, such ambiguity would not support the trial court\u2019s entry of summary judgment. When an easement is ambiguous as to its scope, a trial court may consider parol evidence to determine the parties' intent. <em>Gans v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number><em>Andrulis </em>(May 18, 2001), Portage App. No. 99-P-0118, 2001 WL 530490. In the present case, the record contains parol evidence in the form of affidavits from Jeffrey and Pamela Bair, the individuals who granted the 1998 easement to the school district. The Bairs both aver that the easement was granted specifically \"for storm water runoff.\u201d They also aver that they did not intend to, and would not, grant the school district permission to discharge wastewater on their property via the 1998 easement. Finally, the Bairs aver that no one from the school district ever sought permission to use the 1998 easement for wastewater purposes. Thus, even if there were ambiguity in the 1998 easement, these affidavits would create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the school district could drain treated wastewater onto the Gabels\u2019 property using that easement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b653-7\">. Parenthetically, we note that it is questionable whether governmental entities ever may obtain an easement by estoppel. This is so because \"governmental entities have the alternative of eminent domain <em>to </em>acquire the necessary land * * *. A private person asserting estoppel does not.\u201d <em>Maloney, </em>63 Ohio App.3d at 411, 579 N.E.2d 230.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b653-8\">. The Gabels have not disputed that the school board qualifies as a \"political subdivision\u201d under R.C. Chapter 2744. A political subdivision is defined in R.C. 2744.01(F) as a \u201cmunicipal corporation, township, county, <em>school district, </em>or other body corporate and politic responsible for governmental activities in a geographic area smaller than that of the state.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Under this definition, the Miami East School District is a political subdivision. But because the Miami East School Board is an instrumentality that carries out the functions of its school district, the potential immunity from tort liability provided to political subdivisions under R.C. Chapter 2744 extends to the school board as well. Cf. <em>Brewer v. Butler Cty. Bldg. &amp; Zoning Dept. </em>(2001), 142 Ohio App.3d 567, 573, 756 N.E.2d 222.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b654-8\">. In connection with the trespass claim, the Gabels' complaint does not even allege the existence of negligence. It alleges harm resulting from \u201cthe intentional acts of Defendant.\u201d With regard to the nuisance claim, the Gabels do allege unspecified acts of negligence. As we have explained above, however, the summary judgment evidence does not support a finding of negligence. Instead, the only reasonable conclusion is that the School District intended to bring about the conditions alleged by the Gabels to constitute a nuisance. In such a case, \u201c[wjhere the harm and resulting damage are the necessary consequences of just what the defendant is doing, or is incident to the activity itself or the manner in which it is conducted, the law of negligence has no application[.]\u201d <em>Angerman v.

For example, if the government appropriates a portion of purely residential property for a public use, the landowner usually remains capable of living in his home.

As set forth in our analysis of the easement issue, supra, there remains a triable issue as to whether the drainage of treated wastewater under the 1998 easement imposes an additional burden on the Gabels\u2019 land beyond the burden created by using the easement solely for stormwater purposes. If the school district\u2019s use of the 1998 easement for wastewater purposes does impose an additional burden on the Gabels\u2019 land, then that use is unauthorized and a potential taking exists.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
