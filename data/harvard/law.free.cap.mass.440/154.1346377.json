The corporations paid corporate excise taxes assessed and self-assessed for the fiscal year involved, then filed an application for abatement with the Commissioner of Revenue (commissioner). The application was denied. Three items for which abatement was sought are the subject of this appeal. The first involved an apportionable tax assessed to General Mills, after audit, on the gain it realized from the sale of its Eddie Bauer stock, where the commissioner determined that Eddie Bauer functioned as part of General Mills\u2019s unitary business in Massachusetts. The second involved a self-assessed tax based on income that Talbots had reported, allegedly in error, as its own but in fact was the gain realized by General Mills from the sale of its Talbots stock, where both corporations had joined the purchaser of the stock in an election under I.R.C. \u00a7 338(h)(10), 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 338(h)(10) (1988), to treat the stock sale as a sale of Talbots\u2019s assets. The third concerned an additional tax assessed on Talbots, after audit, on the gain from a sale of the Talbots trademarks and trade names (intangibles) by its wholly owned Delaware subsidiary, Tal HC, Inc. The commissioner determined that Talbots had transferred its intangibles to Tal HC five days before the sale for no consideration, for no legitimate business purpose, and solely to avoid a Massachusetts tax. He then applied the step transaction doctrine and attributed the gain directly to Talbots.</p>\n<p id=\"AtY\">General Mills and its subsidiaries appealed to the Appellate Tax Board (board) under its formal procedure, contending that because the subsidiaries were independently mn businesses and not part of General Mills\u2019s unitary business in Massachusetts, the gain from the sales of stock could not, consistent with constitutional principles, be taxed. General Mills and Talbots also argued that the deemed sale of Talbots\u2019s assets could not be taxed by the Commonwealth because it was a fictitious transaction resulting from an election under the Internal Revenue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>Code that was not recognized by Massachusetts and produced no income in Massachusetts. They also claimed that the transfer and ultimate sale of the Talbots intangibles could not be taxed because neither General Mills nor Talbots had received the proceeds of that sale, or alternatively, that the gain from the sale of the intangibles should be regarded as an out-of-State sale of stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-10\">The board found that although the three corporations did business in Massachusetts, neither subsidiary was engaged in a unitary business with General Mills in Massachusetts. The board concluded that the subsidiaries \u201chad no rational relationship to General Mills\u2019 Massachusetts business. Therefore . . . taxing General Mills\u2019 gain realized from the sale of stock in these entities would result in the [unconstitutional] taxation of extraterritorial values.\u201d The board ordered an abatement and refund of the tax assessed on the sale of the Eddie Bauer stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-19\">However, because General Mills and Talbots had made an election under I.R.C. \u00a7 338(h)(10) to treat the sale of Talbots\u2019s stock as a sale of its assets and consequently reported the gain from that sale on their Federal consolidated return as income to Talbots, the board determined that the gain from that sale was properly included in Talbots\u2019s Massachusetts net income on its combined Massachusetts return with General Mills. The board also concluded that the gain from the sale of Talbots\u2019s intangibles by Tal HC was taxable to Talbots because Talbots\u2019s transfer of its intangibles to Tal HC \u201clacked economic substance beyond the mere creation of tax benefits,\u201d and that the commissioner properly included the gain from the sale of the intangibles in the numerator of the apportionment formula used to calculate Talbots\u2019s additional tax liability. General Mills and Talbots appealed from the portions of the board\u2019s decision pertaining to the sale of Talbots\u2019s stock and intangibles; the commissioner appealed from the decision as to the sale of the Eddie Bauer stock. We transferred the case from the Appeals Court on our own motion, and affirm the decision of the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-38\">1. <em>Facts. </em>The salient facts are not disputed, but some inferenees drawn by the board are disputed. General Mills is a Delaware corporation with its corporate headquarters in Minneapolis, Minnesota. It is engaged in producing and selling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>packaged food products at wholesale. In the early 1970\u2019s, it began to invest in existing companies in different industries. In 1971, General Mills purchased one hundred per cent of the stock of Eddie Bauer, Inc., a foreign corporation engaged in the business of retail sale of sporting goods and sports clothing, with its corporate headquarters in Seattle, Washington. In 1973, General Mills acquired one hundred per cent of the stock of Talbots, Inc., a Massachusetts corporation with corporate headquarters in Hingham. Talbots is a clothing retailer and catalog sales company. In 1988, General Mills sold its interest in both companies. At all relevant times the three companies did business in Massachusetts.</p>\n<p id=\"A9N\">a. <em>Relationship between parent and subsidiaries. </em>The board found that, for purposes of taxation, neither Talbots nor Eddie Bauer had a unitary business relationship with General Mills because \u201cthere was no significant functional integration, centralized management or economies of scale realized by [General Mills] and its subsidiaries.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> During General Mills\u2019s ownership of Eddie Bauer and Talbots, Eddie Bauer had its own senior management responsible for preparing its own budget and running its business from the State of Washington. Talbots also had its own management team, which conducted its affairs from Massachusetts. Each subsidiary had its own employees and administered its own employee related functions, such as training, payroll, and benefits. Each managed its own purchasing, inventory, site selection, and research functions, separate from General Mills. And each maintained its own administrative offices, warehouses, and retail stores, none of which was shared with General Mills. The two subsidiaries shared no centralized purchasing or advertising functions with the parent. Although General Mills and its subsidiaries shared some officers and directors, it was sporadic and they had no involvement in the day-to-day operations of the subsidiaries.</p>\n<p id=\"Amf\">General Mills provided some services to its subsidiaries. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>loaned them money on an \u201cas needed basis\u201d with interest at commercial rates. It guaranteed a subsidiary\u2019s lease whenever required by the landlord, and it would guarantee revenue bonds to finance major capital projects undertaken by a subsidiary. It permitted a subsidiary\u2019s employee pension plan to invest in General Mills\u2019s pooled retirement funds. General Mills provided legal and tax services to its subsidiaries, charging a pro rata share of the legal fees. It did not charge either subsidiary a fee for the tax service because the New York Stock Exchange and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) required wholly owned subsidiaries to file tax returns on a consolidated basis with the parent corporation. Consequently, General Mills decided that it was more efficient and practical to have the necessary returns prepared by the same tax expert, and it absorbed the entire cost.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-18\">General Mills provided administrative support to Talbots and Eddie Bauer through its \u201cspecialty retailing group\u201d (SRG) staffed at various times by fifteen to eighteen employees on General Mills\u2019s payroll. The SRG assisted the subsidiaries in preparing requests for funding from General Mills for major capital projects, and in the preparation of financial and operational reports required by General Mills, as well as other areas of management. The cost of maintaining the SRG, which was located in New York, was borne by the subsidiaries. General Mills provided each subsidiary, cost free, use of the other\u2019s proprietary customer list. Talbots\u2019s list was \u201cone of the most sought after, highest performing and accurately addressed lists in the industry.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b178-31\">In its 1979 stock prospectus, General Mills represented that \u201cit produce[d] and [sold] apparel, accessories and other fashion items . . . and recreational shoes.\u201d In its SEC Form 10-K and annual report for 1986, it represented that it was engaged in competition in three industry areas, including \u201cSpecialty Retailing.\u201d In its 1987 annual report, General Mills stated that Eddie Bauer was one of its \u201cMajor Growth Businesses\u201d and that Talbots was one of its \u201cthree core businesses,\u201d which collectively generated forty-six per cent of the company\u2019s total 1987 income.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-41\">b. <em>Sale of Talbots\u2019s stock. </em>On May 18, 1988, following <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>negotiations with Jusco Co., Ltd. (JCL), General Mills entered into an agreement with Jusco (U.S.A.), Inc., a Delaware subsidiary of JCL, for the purchase and sale of Talbots\u2019s stock. The parties agreed that General Mills would receive $3 million as consideration for joining with JCL, if requested, in an electian under I.R.C. \u00a7 338(h)(10) to treat the sale of Talbots\u2019s stock as a sale of its assets. The $3 million figure was based on an estimate of the increased Federal tax liability that would result from such an election, and the understanding that there would be no State tax liability.</p>\n<p id=\"A7E\">On May 30, 1988, JCL sought a modification to the agreement, for its own purposes. It proposed that \u201c[ijmmediately prior to the sale of Talbots shares by General Mills, Talbots will sell [its] trademark/tradename intangibles to Jusco (Europe), B.V., in the Netherlands [another JCL subsidiary] for a purchase price to be based on an evaluation by [the accounting firm] Touche Ross, which will be deducted from the total US $325 million to be paid for Talbots shares.\u201d General Mills agreed, subject to a determination of increased tax liabilities and a satisfactory indemnification agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"ADJ\">On June 9, 1988, in response to General Mills\u2019s concern that the proposed sale of Talbots\u2019s intangibles to Jusco (Europe) would create a taxable dividend in Massachusetts, JCL proposed an alternative plan to eliminate any potential Massachusetts tax to General Mills. Under the alternative plan, Talbots would create a Delaware corporation to which it would transfer its zero basis intangibles. The new corporation would then sell the intangibles to Jusco (Europe) for $100 million. The consideration for the sale of Talbots\u2019s stock would be $325 million. After the sale of the stock, the new corporation, which would then be controlled by Jusco (U.S.A.), would lend to Jusco (U.S.A.) the $100 million proceeds from the sale of intangibles. Jusco (U.S.A.) would use the money to pay down the $325 million loan it obtained to acquire the Talbots stock. It was understood that by shifting the taxable transaction for the sale of Talbots\u2019s intangible assets from Massachusetts to Delaware, there would be no Massachusetts tax on the gain, and because there is no income tax in Delaware, General Mills would incur no State tax from the sale of Talbots\u2019s intangibles. At some future date, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>new Delaware corporation would be liquidated. General Mills agreed to the alternative plan. Because it understood that Massachusetts might challenge the scheme, General Mills initially requested a hold harmless agreement but abandoned that request when it became satisfied that the alternative plan was tax neutral.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">The alternative plan to sell the Talbots intangibles was carried out. On June 17, 1988, General Mills incorporated Tal HC, Inc., a Delaware corporation, as a wholly owned subsidiary of Talbots. Talbots assigned its intangibles to Tal HC on June 21, 1988. Tal HC licensed the intangibles back to Talbots<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the same day with no provision for royalty payments. On June 26, 1988, Tal HC sold the Talbots intangibles to Jusco (Europe) for $100 million. Prior to that date, Tal HC had no employees and no liabilities. Its assets consisted of the Talbots intangibles and ten dollars it received from Talbots for Tal HC\u2019s stock. Its only business activities during this time were those just described. Also on June 26, Jusco (Europe) licensed the Talbots intangibles back to Talbots. That licensing agreement contained a provision for royalty payments based on a percentage of sales. Jusco (Europe) received royalty payments from Talbots that averaged more than $24,000 each day from July, 1988, through December, 1988. Tal HC had received no royalty payments for the six days it owned the intangibles.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">On June 27, 1988, General Mills sold its Talbots stock to Jusco (U.S.A.) for $325 million. After the sale Tal HC, which was then controlled by Jusco (U.S.A.) by virtue of its ownership of Talbots\u2019s stock, loaned to Jusco (U.S.A.) the $100 million that it received from Jusco (Europe) on June 26, 1988. Jusco (U.S.A.) applied the $100 million to the $325 million loan it obtained to acquire the Talbots stock. These steps were taken pursuant to JCL\u2019s June 9, 1988, alternative plan. Approximately nine months later, General Mills and Talbots joined Jusco (U.S.A.) in an election under I.R.C. \u00a7 338(h)(10). Consequently, General Mills filed a 1989 Federal consolidated return and a combined Massachusetts return that both treated the sale of Talbots\u2019s stock as a sale of assets by Talbots. General Mills reported Tal HC\u2019s sale of Talbots\u2019s intangibles on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>consolidated Federal return as a direct sale of assets by Tal HC. It could not include the sale of intangibles in the I.R.C. \u00a7 338(h)(10) election because it took place the day before the sale of Talbots\u2019s stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">2. <em>Sale of the Eddie Bauer stock. </em>The commissioner contends that the board erroneously determined that there was no unitary business relationship between General Mills and Eddie Bauer and misapplied the test used to determine the existence of such a relationship. Findings of the board are final, see G. L. c. 58A, \u00a7 13, and will not be disturbed if they are supported by sufficient evidence. \u201cOur review of the sufficiency of the evidence is limited to \u2018whether a contrary conclusion is not merely a possible but a necessary inference from the findings.\u2019 \u201d <em>Olympia &amp; York State St. Co. </em>v. <em>Assessors of Boston, </em>428 Mass. 236, 240 (1998), quoting <em>Kennametal, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>426 Mass. 39, 43 (1997), cert. denied, 523 U.S. 1059 (1998). The credibility of witnesses, the weight of the evidence, and inferences that reasonably may be drawn from the evidence are matters for the board. See <em>Kennametal, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, supra </em>at 43 n.6. If the decision of the board is supported by sufficient evidence, it will not be set aside unless it is based on an error of law. See <em>Syms Corp. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>436 Mass. 505, 511 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">As a general rule, the commerce clause and the due process clause of the United States Constitution prohibit a State from imposing a tax on value earned outside its borders. See <em>ASARCO Inc. </em>v. <em>Idaho State Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>458 U.S. 307, 315 (1982). However, a State may tax a nondomiciliary corporation on an apportionable share of its interstate business provided there is a \u201c \u2018minimal connection\u2019 or \u2018nexus\u2019 between the interstate activities and the taxing State, and \u2018a rational relationship between the income attributed to the State and the intrastate values of the enterprise.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Exxon Corp. </em>v. <em>Department of Revenue of Wis., </em>447 U.S. 207, 219-220 (1980), quoting <em>Mobil Oil Corp. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Taxes, </em>445 U.S. 425, 436, 437 (1980). This is known as the unitary business principle. It permits a State to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>apportionably tax a nondomiciliary corporation on income received from a subsidiary, even if the subsidiary does no business in the taxing State, provided the income is attributable to the subsidiary\u2019s operational involvement in the parent\u2019s interstate business that is subject to apportionable taxation by the State. See <em>Container Corp. of Am. </em>v. <em>Franchise Tax Bd., </em>463 U.S. 159, 165-166 (1983); <em>Mobil Oil Corp. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Taxes, supra </em>at 438.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">The test used to determine the existence of a unitary business relationship between a corporation and its subsidiary for purposes of assessing an apportionable tax focuses on whether \u201ccontributions to income result[] from functional integration, centralization of management, and economies of scale.\u201d <em>Id. </em>See <em>Container Corp. of Am. </em>v. <em>Franchise Tax Bd., supra </em>at 179. The United States Supreme Court has not decided whether any one factor under this test would be sufficient to establish the existence of a unitary business. <em>Id. </em>at 179-180. A State may not tax a nondomiciliary corporation\u2019s income that is derived from a subsidiary\u2019s unrelated business activity that constitutes a discrete business enterprise. See <em>id. </em>at 166; <em>Mobil Oil Corp. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Taxes, supra </em>at 439, 442. The burden is on the taxpayer to show \u201cby \u2018clear and cogent evidence\u2019 that [the State tax] results in extraterritorial values being taxed.\u201d <em>Container Corp. of Am. </em>v. <em>Franchise Tax Bd., supra </em>at 164, quoting <em>Exxon Corp. </em>v. <em>Department of Revenue of Wis., supra </em>at 221.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">The commissioner contends that the \u201ccentralized management\u201d test was satisfied by the management direction that General Mills provided to Eddie Bauer through its hierarchical SRG staffed by General Mills officers; by the guidelines imposed on Eddie Bauer that determined key issues, corporate strategy, and economic targets; and by the officers and directors that they shared. We disagree. Although there were \u201csome managerial links\u201d between the companies, they were insufficient to establish the level of integration needed for the existence of a unitary business. <em>F.W. Woolworth Co. </em>v. <em>Taxation &amp; Revenue Dep\u2019t of N.M., </em>458 U.S. 354, 368 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">Contrary to the commissioner\u2019s assertions, General Mills did not, either directly or through the SRG, involve itself in the operational management of either subsidiary or establish busi-</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>ness guidelines for them. Although nine officers and directors served both General Mills and Eddie Bauer at different times during portions of the corporate fiscal years ending May, 1976, 1977, 1988, and 1989, the uncontroverted evidence was that they did not participate in the day-to-day management of Eddie Bauer or interject themselves into the business decisions of its management. See <em>id. </em>at 368-369 (sporadic participation of common directors at board meetings insufficient to establish unitary relationship). The SRG did not direct the management of Eddie Bauer or Talbots to do anything. It was not involved in the day-to-day management of either subsidiary and it did not oversee any of their operations. <em>Id. </em>The primary purpose of the SRG was to provide administrative support to the subsidiaries'and coordinate their requests for major capital funding for review by General Mills. The board found that the benefits that the subsidiaries received from the SRG were minimal, and that they bore the cost of the services provided to them. Contrast <em>Container Corp. of Am. </em>v. <em>Franchise Tax Bd., supra </em>at 180 n.19. After Eddie Bauer and Talbots were both sold, most employees of the SRG lost their jobs precisely because they were not part of General Mills\u2019s management team, and the senior management staff of Eddie Bauer remained with Eddie Bauer after the sale. The economic \u201cperformance targets\u201d that General Mills set for the subsidiaries were not operational guidelines that dictated the internal workings of the subsidiaries, but instead were the type of performance demands that the sole shareholder of any business corporation would make in overseeing its investment. Such evidence does not compel a finding that a unitary relationship existed. See <em>F.W. Woolworth Co. </em>v. <em>Taxation &amp; Revenue Dep\u2019t of N.M., supra </em>at 369. The key issues and corporate strategies needed to attain those levels of performance were determined autonomously by management of the subsidiaries, persuasive evidence that Eddie Bauer and Talbots operated independently of General Mills and that no centralized management existed between them. See <em>id. </em>at 364-365.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">The commissioner correctly observes that \u201cmere decentralization of day-to-day management responsibility and accountability cannot defeat a unitary business finding,\u201d <em>Container Corp. of Am. </em>v. <em>Franchise Tax Bd., supra </em>at 180 n.19, citing <em>Exxon Corp. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>v. <em>Department of Revenue of Wis., supra </em>at 224. However, it is also true that \u201ca unitary business finding could not be based merely on \u2018the type of occasional oversight \u2014 with respect to capital structure, major debt, and dividends \u2014 that any parent gives to an investment in a subsidiary.\u2019 \u201d <em>Container Corp. of Am. </em>v. <em>Franchise Tax Bd., supra, </em>quoting <em>F.W. Woolworth Co. </em>v. <em>Taxation &amp; Revenue Dep\u2019t of N.M., supra </em>at 369. \u201cThe difference lies in whether the management role that the parent does play is grounded in its own operational expertise and its overall operational strategy.\u201d <em>Container Corp. of Am. </em>v. <em>Franchise Tax Bd., supra </em>at 180 n.19. \u201c[T]he proper inquiry looks to \u2018the underlying unity or diversity of business enterprise,\u2019 <em>[Mobil Oil Corp. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Taxes, supra </em>at 440], not to whether the nondomiciliary parent derives some economic benefit \u2014 as it virtually always will \u2014 from its ownership of stock in another corporation. <em>[ASARCO Inc. </em>v. <em>Idaho State Tax Comm\u2019n, supra </em>at 325-329].\u201d <em>F.W. Woolworth Co. </em>v. <em>Taxation &amp; Revenue Dep\u2019t of N.M., supra </em>at 363-364. There is no evidence that General Mills inteijected its operational expertise of the wholesale food industry into the management of Eddie Bauer, a business oriented toward retail sales of sports clothing and sporting goods. Similarly, there is no evidence that General Mills imposed the over-all operational strategy used in its wholesale food business onto Eddie Bauer. There is, as discussed above, sufficient evidence to support the board\u2019s findings that there was no centralized management between General Mills and its subsidiaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-30\">The commissioner next contends that the board misapplied the \u201cfunctional integration\u201d and \u201ceconomies of scale\u201d tests, arguing that under <em>Container Corp. of Am. </em>v. <em>Franchise Tax Bd., supra </em>at 178, the \u201cultimate issue is whether there was a \u2018flow of value\u2019 between General Mills and [Eddie] Bauer.\u201d His understanding of <em>Container Corp. </em>is flawed. The commissioner\u2019s approach would produce a unitary business finding in virtually every case, as there will almost always be some flow of value through unity of ownership. His approach has been rejected by the Supreme Court. See <em>Container Corp. of Am. </em>v. <em>Franchise Tax Bd., supra </em>at 178-179; <em>F.W. Woolworth Co. </em>v. <em>Taxation &amp; Revenue Dep\u2019t of N.M., supra </em>at 363-364; <em>ASARCO Inc. </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number><em>Idaho State Tax Comm\u2019n, supra </em>at 325-328. Although there must be a \u201cflow of value,\u201d there also must be some \u201cunderlying unity ... of business enterprise,\u201d <em>Mobil Oil Corp. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Taxes, supra </em>at 440, some \u201csubstantial mutual interdependence,\u201d <em>F.W. Woolworth Co. </em>v. <em>Taxation &amp; Revenue Dep\u2019t of N.M., supra </em>at 371. See <em>Container Corp. of Am. </em>v. <em>Franchise Tax Bd., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">The \u201cflow of value\u201d on which the- commissioner relies, namely, the ability of Eddie Bauer to borrow funds from General Mills on an as-needed basis and the cost-free provision of cash management services, either does not arise from a unity of business enterprise or is unsupported by the record.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> All loans to the subsidiaries were arm\u2019s-length transactions at commercial rates; and, except for absorbing the entire cost of preparing the consolidated tax returns required by the SEC and the New York Stock Exchange, General Mills charged Eddie Bauer for the cost of all services provided. These facts do not support a finding that the businesses were functionally integrated. See W.R. <em>Grace &amp; Co.-Conn. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>58 Mass. App. Ct. 469, 476 (2003). There is no evidence that these transactions served an operational function of General Mills. Rather, the transactions are consistent with the existence of an investment function. Contrast <em>Container Corp. of Am. </em>v. <em>Franchise Tax Bd., supra </em>at 180 n.19. Where, as here, a parent invests in a subsidiary that engages in a business truly distinct from that of the parent, it is less likely that the two enterprises will coordinate functions by operational integration, sharing expertise, or economies of scale. See <em>id. </em>at 178. The record does not support the commissioner\u2019s claim that Eddie Bauer received cash management services from General Mills, or that such services were provided to Eddie Bauer on a cost-free basis. The record does support the board\u2019s finding that the few services <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>that General Mills did provide to Eddie Bauer served an investment function, not an operational function.

See <em>Becton, Dickinson &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Revenue, </em>383 Mass. 786, 789 (1981). The board declined to make such a finding, citing <em>F.W. Woolworth Co. </em>v. <em>Taxation &amp; Revenue Dep\u2019t of N.M., supra </em>at 369 (publication of \u201cannual reports ... on a consolidated basis\u201d alone is not controlling). Moreover, the annual reports do not compel such a finding, but rather suggest that General Mills simply was describing itself as a holding company and that Eddie Bauer was but one of many companies that it owned.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">The evidence is sufficient to support the board\u2019s findings that Eddie Bauer was acquired by General Mills as an investment and treated as such, that it was not operationally integrated into General Mills\u2019s wholesale food business but instead operated as an independent business, and that General Mills\u2019s occasional involvement in the management of Eddie Bauer was \u201cmore akin to [that of] a parent company\u2019s oversight of its investment in a subsidiary.\u201d See <em>F.W.

They rely on <em>Rohrbough, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>385 Mass. 830, 832 (1982), where the court said: \u201cAlthough the figure shown as gross income on a taxpayer\u2019s Federal return will normally be the gross income for State tax purposes for the same tax year, <em>this is not always the </em>case\u201d (emphasis added), and Weston Marketing Corp. vs. Commissioner of Revenue, Appellate Tax Board No. 161893 (1994), aff'd, 40 Mass. App. Ct. 1108 (1996), which they describe as \u201canother instance in which Massachusetts gross income was different from [F]ederal gross income because of a fictional transaction prescribed by [F]ederal tax law.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> However, neither case holds that a \u201cfictional\u201d treatment of gross income prescribed by Federal tax law may not be used to determine gross income for Massachusetts tax purposes, or that Massachusetts does not recognize the particular \u201cfictional\u201d treatment of gross income under I.R.C. \u00a7 338(h)(10).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>In the <em>Rohrbough </em>case the court was presented with a differential treatment of income for Federal and State purposes that had been brought about by an election under Massachusetts law. George I. Rohrbough realized a substantial gain in 1971 from the sale of real estate in Boston. The sales price was to be paid over six years, pursuant to promissory notes. The transaction qualified for treatment as an instalment sale under I.R.C. \u00a7 453, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 453 (1976). The Federal tax was thereby spread out over six years, as each note matured. Rohrbough elected, pursuant to G. L. c. 62, \u00a7 63 <em>(e), </em>to pay the Massachusetts tax on the entire gain with his 1971 Massachusetts individual tax return. In 1974, he transferred the remaining instalment notes for all the shares of stock of Rohrbough, Inc., a transaction that qualified as a tax free exchange under I.R.C. \u00a7 351, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 351 (1966). Thereafter, the corporation received instalment payments that it reported on its Federal returns. It did not report the payments on its Massachusetts returns because Rohrbough had paid the Massachusetts income tax due on the entire gain with his 1971 individual return. The commissioner assessed a tax on these payments and denied the corporation\u2019s applications for abatement. The corporation appealed to the board, which ruled that it was entitled to the abatements. <em>Rohrbough, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, supra </em>at 830-831. The court affirmed the decision of the board, holding that where the State tax on the gain had been fully paid in 1971 pursuant to an election under G. L. c. 62, \u00a7 63 <em>(e), </em>the commissioner could not impose what amounted to a double tax on the gain. <em>Id. </em>at 831. The court construed the reference to gross income in G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 30, as a reference \u201cto the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and not simply to the amount of gross income shown on a taxpayer\u2019s Federal income tax return for the same tax year.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 832. The original differential treatment of the gain by Rohrbough for Federal and State purposes was specifically permitted by G. L. c. 62, \u00a7 63 <em>(e), </em>and the court applied various provisions of the Internal Revenue Code to preserve that treatment for his successor in interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">Weston Marketing Corp. <em>vs. </em>Commissioner of Revenue, <em>supra, </em>is similar, but the differential treatment of income in that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>case was, by statute, mandatory, and amounted to nonrecognition of income. In that case the taxpayer was a corporation that had elected Subchapter S status for Federal tax purposes. It had acquired certain regulated futures contracts on which it was required, pursuant to I.R.C. \u00a7 1256, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 1256 (1981), to recognize any gain or loss at market value on the last day of the year. On December 31, 1981, the aggregate market value of the taxpayer\u2019s futures contracts was less than its cost, and pursuant to \u00a7 1256, it reported a loss on its Federal tax return. However, it was not permitted to take the loss on its Massachusetts return because Massachusetts did not recognize Sub-chapter S corporations at the time. See G. L. c. 62, \u00a7 2, as appearing in St. 1973, c. 723, \u00a7 2.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In 1982 the taxpayer sold some of its futures contracts and reported a gain on its 1982 Federal return that reflected a recapture of the loss reported on its 1981 Federal return. It also reported a gain on its 1982 Massachusetts return, but that gain did not include the recaptured loss from 1981 because the taxpayer could not and did not claim the loss on its 1981 Massachusetts return. The board rejected the commissioner\u2019s argument that, as matter of law, a taxpayer\u2019s Massachusetts gross income will be the same as the amount shown on its Federal return. It ruled instead that it must look to the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code to determine a taxpayer\u2019s gross income, citing <em>Rohrbough, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, supra. </em>The board noted that I.R.C. \u00a7 111(a), 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 111(a) (1980), in effect at the time, excluded from gross income \u201cincome attributable to the recovery during the taxable year of any amount deducted in any prior taxable year to the extent such amount did not reduce the amount of tax imposed.\u201d Weston Marketing Corp. vs. Commissioner of Revenue, <em>supra </em>at 6. It concluded that where the taxpayer appellant \u201cdid not have the benefit of the loss for Massachusetts purposes, there is no logical or statutory basis for recapturing that loss for Massachusetts purposes.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">There is no merit to the claim that Massachusetts does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>recognize the election under I.R.C. \u00a7 338(h)(10). General Laws c. 63, \u00a7 30, operates to include all gross income determined under the Internal Revenue Code, except income that is expressly excluded. There is no statute that denies recognition of an election under \u00a7 338(h)(10) or otherwise excludes income resulting from such an election from the application of G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 30. See <em>Koch </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>416 Mass. 540, 551 (1993); Weston Marketing Corp. vs. Commissioner of Revenue, <em>supra. </em>The election is therefore recognized. Similarly, differential treatment of income requires specific statutory authority, as in <em>Rohrbough, </em>and General Mills and Talbots cite no statute that permits or requires differential treatment of Talbots\u2019s Federal and State gross income. We also note that neither General Mills nor Talbots has been exposed to double taxation, as was the taxpayer in <em>Rohrbough, </em>nor has either been assessed a tax on a benefit that was not received, as occurred in the Weston Marketing case.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-20\">We are not persuaded that the gain resulting from the \u201cfietian\u201d should not be taxed because it produced no income in Massachusetts. A gain actually was realized from the sale of the Talbots stock. Had Talbots actually sold its assets, there can be no doubt that the gain would have been taxable in Massachusetts. The \u201cfiction\u201d created by I.R.C. \u00a7 338(h)(10) simply allowed the parties to change the means by which the gain was realized and by whom. It permitted General Mills and Talbots to elect which of them would report that gain on its portian of their consolidated Federal return. Because they elected to have Talbots report the gain, the gross income on Talbots\u2019s Federal tax return increased by the amount of the gain, precisely as if it had sold its assets and produced income in Massachusetts; and General Mills\u2019s gross income was correspondingly reduced, as if it had never sold its Talbots stock. There was nothing \u201cfictional\u201d about the effect of the election for Federal tax purposes. Talbots became liable for a Federal tax on the gain. Moreover, the tax would not simply be the same amount that General Mills would have paid had the election not been made. As a result of the election, General Mills effectively dropped out of the picture, and the tax would be based on Talbots\u2019s separate return, which amounted to approximately $3 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>million more than General Mills would have paid. Those nonfictional consequences had been anticipated and adjustments were made during negotiations between General Mills and JCL. The election also produced Massachusetts tax consequences consistent with the Federal treatment of the gain. See <em>Dow Chem. Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>378 Mass. 254, 264 (1979). There is no suggestion that this approach will cause confusion among the States and lead to double taxation. Because \u00a7 338(h)(10) treated the gain from the deemed sale of Talbots\u2019s assets as includable in its Federal gross income, the literal wording of G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 30, requires that it also be included in Talbots\u2019s Massachusetts gross income. See <em>id. </em>The board correctly determined that the gain from the deemed sale was includable in Talbots\u2019s Massachusetts gross income.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">4. <em>Sale of intangibles. </em>The board found that \u201cthe creation of Tal HC, the transfer of Talbots\u2019 intangibles and the subsequent sale by Tal HC, lacked economic substance . . . beyond the mere creation of tax benefits.\u201d It applied the \u201cstep transaction doctrine\u201d and concluded that \u201c [notwithstanding the form of the transaction, its substance was the direct sale of the intangibles by Talbots.\u201d General Mills and Talbots argue that the board\u2019s decision is not supported by the record, and that the transaction had a valid business purpose and economic substance beyond the creation of tax benefits. They contend that the transaction was in furtherance of General Mills\u2019s over-all business purpose to sell the Talbots stock, that JCL structured the transaction in a manner that would transfer the trademarks to a foreign affiliate in order to obtain certain advantages in the international market and advantages under certain international accounting practices, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>and that pursuant to the terms of the purchase and sale agreement General Mills was required to accommodate JCL.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">The step transaction doctrine is a rule that, for purposes of taxation, looks to the substance of a transaction over its form. See <em>Commissioner of Revenue </em>v. <em>Dupee, </em>423 Mass. 617, 624 (1996), quoting 11 Mertens, Federal Income Taxation \u00a7 43.253, at 347 (1995). It \u201ctreats a series of formally separate \u2018steps\u2019 as a single transaction if such steps are in substance integrated, interdependent, and focused toward a particular result.\u201d <em>Penrod </em>v. <em>Commissioner, </em>88 T.C. 1415, 1428 (1987). See <em>Commissioner of Internal Revenue </em>v. <em>Court Holding Co., </em>324 U.S. 331, 334 (1945) (\u201cThe incidence of taxation depends upon the substance of a transaction. ... A sale by one person cannot be transformed for tax purposes into a sale by another by using the latter as a conduit through which to pass title\u201d); <em>Minnesota Tea Co. </em>v. <em>Helvering, </em>302 U.S. 609, 613 (1938) (\u201cA given result at the end of a straight path is not made a different result because reached by following a devious path\u201d). \u201cThus, the substance of each of a series of steps will be recognized and the step transaction doctrine will not apply, if each such step demonstrates independent economic significance, is not subject to attack as a sham, and was undertaken for valid business purposes and not mere avoidance of taxes.\u201d <em>Commissioner of Revenue </em>v. <em>Dupee, supra, </em>quoting Rev. Rul. 79-250, 1979-2 C.B. 156.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">There was ample evidence to support the board\u2019s findings. JCL\u2019s initial modification called for Talbots to sell its intangibles directly to Jusco (Europe). After General Mills expressed concern about the Massachusetts tax consequences, JCL proposed the two-step transaction that would satisfy the needs of both parties: Jusco (Europe) would acquire the Talbots intangibles, and General Mills would not have to pay a Massachusetts tax. The intermediate transaction served no legitimate business purpose and was designed solely to avoid a Massachusetts tax. It is immaterial that the end result may have been for legitimate business purposes. If an intermediate step has no legitimate business purpose beyond tax avoidance, it may be collapsed for tax purposes under the step transaction doctrine. Tal HC was merely a conduit through which the legitimate transactional route passed, and its involvement was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>properly compressed into a single sale of the Talbots intangibles directly to Jusco (Europe).</p>\n<p id=\"AVn\">General Mills and Talbots contend that Tal HC was not just a paper entity with no employees or offices. There was evidence, however, that such was the case, and that the original plan was to liquidate Tal HC shortly after it sold the intangibles. The finding of the board on this point is thus final, and one that we cannot disturb. But even if Tal HC were a functioning business, the result would not change because the over-all nature of the intermediate step is what matters, not just the nature of the intermediary, although that may be relevant, as here. Applicatian of the step transaction doctrine is not limited to paper entities, and General Mills and Talbots cite no authority to the contrary. It is significant that the licensing agreement between Talbots and Tal HC did not require Talbots to make any royalty payments, but that the licensing agreement between Talbots and Jusco (Europe) did. This is persuasive evidence that Tal HC had no legitimate role in the sale other than tax avoidance.</p>\n<p id=\"AtT\">General Mills and Talbots also argue that if the sale of Talbots\u2019s intangibles is to be compressed by application of the step transaction doctrine, then the entire plan must be reduced to a single transaction for the sale of the Talbots stock.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> They ignore the fact that the parties structured their agreement as two separate transactions. If we were to grant the relief that General Mills and Talbots seek, we would be changing the basic nature of that agreement. JCL did not agree to a simple sale of stock; it agreed to buy assets. The parties agreed to two separate transactions: one for the sale of stock (subject to an election under \u00a7 338[h][10]), and one for the sale of intangibles. And so it was that two separate transactions involving four distinct corporations were presented to the Federal government for taxation: one, a deemed sale of assets by Talbots to Jusco (U.S.A.); the other, a sale of intangibles by Tal HC to Jusco (Europe). It is significant that Talbots and Tal HC paid Federal taxes on a total reported gain of $425 million from the two transactions, and JCL received a stepped up basis of $425 million in the assets it acquired. See I.R.C. \u00a7 338(h)(10); Letter Ruling 84-45, 3 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>Official MassTax Guide at 816-817 (West 2003) (Massachusetts affords stepped-up basis from election under I.R.C. \u00a7 338[h][10]). The step transaction doctrine was correctly applied to straighten the circuitous route taken in the second transaction, allowing the Commonwealth to assess a tax on the true nature of that transaction, namely, a sale of intangibles by Talbots to Jusco (Europe), while leaving the over-all agreement intact.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">5. <em>Tax on sale of intangibles. </em>Under Massachusetts law, a corporation\u2019s taxable net income is multiplied by a three-factor apportionment formula to determine the percentage of the income that is taxable in Massachusetts. See G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 38 (c) (taxable net income apportioned to Commonwealth by multiplying such income \u201cby a fraction, the numerator of which is the property factor plus the payroll factor plus twice times the sales factor, and the denominator of which is four\u201d). See <em>Gillette Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>425 Mass. 670, 673 (1997). The board determined that the commissioner properly included the receipts from Talbots\u2019s sale of its intangibles in the numerator of Talbots\u2019s sales factor, which is determined pursuant to G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 38 <em>(f).</em><footnotemark><em>13</em></footnotemark><em> </em>As part of that determination the board concluded that, pursuant to \u00a7 38 (f) (2), \u201ca greater portion of the intangibles\u2019 income-producing activity was performed in the Commonwealth than in any other [S]tote, based on cost of performance.\u201d The board based its conclusion on findings that it was the business operations (including billing and customer relations) and management of Talbots, all of which were located in Massachusetts, that produced most of the value of the intangibles. The board also noted that all orders for goods were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>sent to and filled from Talbots\u2019s distribution centers, all of which were located in Massachusetts.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">General Mills and Talbots first argue that the board\u2019s recent decision in Combustion Eng\u2019g, Inc. <em>vs. </em>Commissioner of Revenue, Appellate Tax Board No. F228740 (2000), requires that the sale of intangibles be excluded from the numerator of Talbots\u2019s sales factor. The Combustion Engineering case has no relevance to the issue at hand. In that case the board ruled that the proceeds from a deemed sale of assets following an election under I.R.C. \u00a7 338(h)(10) could not be included in the sales factor because the sales in question actually were a sale of stock, the proceeds of which are specifically excluded from the sales factor pursuant to G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 38 <em>(f). </em>Here, the sale did not involve a sale of stock, but a sale of Talbots\u2019s trademarks and trade names, which are not excluded from the sales factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">There is no merit to the argument that all the income-producing activity occurred outside Massachusetts, either in Virginia, where a major portion of Talbots\u2019s catalogs were printed, or in New York and Minnesota, where the sale was negotiated. Such reasoning trivializes the years of work and business effort that developed the value of Talbots\u2019s intangibles, and the argument ignores the undisputed evidence, which the board accepted, that at each step of the catalog development process it was Talbots\u2019s management and employees, located in Massachusetts, who were responsible for the decision-making in preparing and finalizing the catalog and contributed most to the value of the intangibles. The board properly rejected the argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">Finally, General Mills and Talbots argue that the effect of placing the receipts from the sale of intangibles in the numerator of Talbots\u2019s sales factor together with only one month of regular sales from the relevant fiscal year grossly distorted its actual business activity in Massachusetts and thereby resulted in an extraterritorial tax in violation of the due process and commerce clauses. In order to prevail on their constitutional challenge they have the \u201cdistinct burden of showing by \u2018clear and cogent evidence\u2019 that [the State tax] results in extraterritorial values being taxed.\u201d <em>Container Corp. of Am. </em>v. <em>Franchise Tax Bd., </em>463 U.S. 159, 164 (1983), quoting <em>Exxon Corp. </em>v. <em>Depart-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number><em>merit of Revenue of Wis., </em>447 U.S. 207, 223 (1980). It is uncertain how inclusion of the receipts from the sale of the intangibles would result in an extraterritorial tax. The Commonwealth\u2019s apportionment formula need only produce \u201ca \u2018rough approximation\u2019 of the corporate income that is \u2018reasonably related to the activities conducted within the taxing State.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 223, quoting <em>Moorman Mfg.

The question before the court was whether the gain from a deemed sale of assets pursuant to an election under I.R.C. \u00a7 338(h)(10) was taxable as business income or nonbusiness income under Pennsylvania law. Nonbusiness income is taxed at a lower rate. The subsidiary had reported the gain from the deemed sale as nonbusiness income on its return. The court concluded that the gain was taxable as nonbusiness income. Apropos to this case, the gain was both reportable by and taxable to the subsidiary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b193-40\">The commissioner argues that this issue was not raised below, but we are satisfied that it was. See note 8, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b194-6\">General Laws c. 63, \u00a7 38 (f), states: \u201cThe sales factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total sales of the corporation in this commonwealth during the taxable year, and the denominator of which is the total sales of the corporation everywhere during the taxable year. As used in this subsection, \u2018sales\u2019 means all gross receipts of the corporation except interest, dividends, and gross receipts from the maturity, redemption, sale, exchange or other disposition of securities. . . . Sales [of intangible] personal property, are in this commonwealth if: . . . 2. the income-producing activity is performed both in and outside this commonwealth and a greater proportion of this income-producing activity is performed in this commonwealth than in any other state, based on costs of performance.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
