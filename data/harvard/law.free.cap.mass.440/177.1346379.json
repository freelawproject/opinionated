Rule 1:07, as amended, 431 Mass. 1301 (2000), concerning fee-generating appointments by the court, when considering a petition to appoint a trustee of a charitable trust who is \u201cprayed for by name\u201d in the petition.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In this case, a will drawn early in the last century established several trusts and named three trustees, but contained no provision for the trustees\u2019 replacements. In 2000 one of the trustees died, and the two remaining trustees filed a petition to appoint a new trustee, identifying him by name in the petition. A judge in the Probate and Family Court concluded, in effect, that rule 1:07 mandated that he deny the petition and appoint instead the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>person next listed on a list maintained by the Probate and Family Court pursuant to rule 1:07 (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">We conclude that the trustees\u2019 petition was not subject to rule 1:07 and that the judge should not have rejected the proposed trustee solely in reliance on that rule. We remand that issue for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. We affirm two related orders entered by the judge concerning the submissions of sworn statements of services by the trustees and the appointment of a guardian ad litem.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">1. <em>Background. </em>On September 25, 1924, Lotta M. Crabtree died, leaving a will establishing several charitable tmsts, seven of which are still active. Her will identified three trustees to administer the trusts, but made no provision for their replacements. As vacancies occurred over the intervening decades, the remaining trustees petitioned the Probate Court for replacement appointments pursuant to G. L. c. 203, \u00a7 5, in each case naming a replacement trustee.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The two current trustees, Robert J. Naughton and Francis J. Harney (trustees), were both appointed in this manner, as was the most recent third trustee, Joseph F. Lyons, who died on July 5, 2000.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">Among the seven active trusts is the Lotta Agricultural Fund trust (loan fund trust), the purpose of which is to make interest-free loans \u201cto such graduates of the Massachusetts Agricultural College, in Amherst, Massachusetts [now the University of Massachusetts], as have completed their course at said college and have received diplomas therefrom, and who desire to follow agricultural pursuits but are without means to enter upon the same.\u201d As loans are repaid, the repaid funds are to be reinvested in the loan fund trust for the same purpose. In the event that the loan fund trust\u2019s income cannot be used in its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>entirety for loans to eligible graduates, Crabtree\u2019s will directs that the income be used \u201csemi-annually to assist needy and meritorious students in completing their courses of study in said . . . [c]allege.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">The trustees are required by statute to file annual accounts with the Probate Court. See G. L. c. 206, \u00a7 1. In May, 2000, trustees Naughton, Harney, and Lyons filed their fifth accounts. The Attorney General, who had been notified pursuant to G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 8G, did not file an appearance, nor did he otherwise object to the allowance of the accounts. In connection with the accounts for six of the trusts, the trustees reported fees ranging from $636 to $2,163; for the loan fund trust the trustees reported fees of $138,498 for the year at issue, January 1, 1999, through December 31, 1999. On November 17, 2000, the judge allowed all but the loan fund trust accounts, which he \u201cwished to review further.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">After the death of Lyons, the two remaining trustees filed the sixth and final accounts for the period of Lyons\u2019s service. These accounts covered approximately six months, from January 1, 2000, through July 5, 2000, the date of Lyons\u2019s death. As with the previous accounts, the Attorney General was notified, and again, did not file an objection to the allowance of the accounts.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As before, the trustees reported substantially greater fees in connection with the loan fund trust, this time in the amount of $68,661, whereas fees for the six other trusts ranged from $294 to $1,221. As the judge later noted, and the trustees do not dispute, the trustees paid themselves fees of more than $530,000 for the then most recent four years for which they filed accounts pertaining to all seven trusts.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">As noted above, Crabtree\u2019s will provides that income of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>loan fund trust be used \u201csemi-annually\u201d to assist needy students. However, the judge found that the ending balance of funds in the loan fund trust, as reported in the sixth account, was $4,561,810 and that both the fifth and sixth accounts had \u201cbeginning income balances and ending income balances in excess of $300,000 despite an apparent requirement of the trust that all income be used semi-annually.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">After reviewing the trustees\u2019 sixth accounts, on May 17, 2001, the judge issued fourteen orders, two for each trust directed to each trustee, ordering the trustees to file a sworn written statement (statement of services) in connection with both the fifth and sixth accounts of the trusts to include (1) a dated itemized record of all time spent for which compensation was paid; (2) a dated itemization of all expenses for which reimbursement was paid; (3) the total payment made to the trustee; and (4) a certification that the services listed were provided and that the services and time spent were necessary and within the scope of services which the trustee was appointed to perform.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">Also on May 17, 2001, the judge appointed a guardian ad litem, Attorney James R. DeGiacomo, \u201cto represent the interests of potential student charitable beneficiaries\u201d of the loan fund trust in the then pending actions for allowance of the fifth and sixth accounts.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Accompanying the appointment of the guardian ad litem was a temporary order, in which the judge directed the guardian to review the trustees\u2019 compensation and to ascertain whether the trustees were using fund income, recording distributions and making investments in accordance with the terms of the Crabtree will.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> On June 15, 2001, the trustees filed three <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>motions for reconsideration,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> each of which the judge denied in a written memorandum dated August 10, 2001. The trustees appealed from the judge\u2019s orders and from his denial of their motions for reconsideration.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">Meanwhile, on April 19, 2001, the trustees had filed a petition for the appointment of \u201cFrancis L. Swift, or some other suitable person\u201d to fill the vacancy occasioned by Lyons\u2019s death. The petition as filed consisted of a preprinted form, with the trustees submitting the information called for by that form.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> At a brief hearing on the petition, during which Swift was present in the court room, the trustees informed the judge that the requisite bonds for Swift had been filed. See G. L. c. 205, \u00a7 1. The judge made no inquiry concerning Swift\u2019s qualifications. On November 30, 2001, the judge issued his ruling on the petition. He declined to appoint Swift as successor trustee and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>instead appointed Elizabeth F. Potter, the person next on the list maintained by the court pursuant to rule 1:07 (2).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The trustees also appeal from this ruling. The guardian ad litem opposes both appeals.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">2. <em>Appointment of the successor trustee. </em>We begin by reviewing the judge\u2019s November 30, 2001, decision denying the trustees\u2019 petition to appoint Swift as the successor trustee to Lyons, and appointing Potter from the list maintained by the Probate and Family Court pursuant to rule 1:07. Rejecting Swift, the judge stated: \u201cFee generating appointments made by a judge, including appointments of trustees, are subject to Supreme Judicial Court Rule 1:07.\u201d We infer from this that, in the judge\u2019s view, rule 1:07 governs every appointment of a trustee of a charitable trust whenever the trust instrument contains no provision for the replacement of trustees. See G. L. c. 203, \u00a7 5. But see note 21, <em>infra. </em>The judge noted that rule 1:07 had been amended in January, 1999, in the wake of a December, 1997, Report to the Justices by this court\u2019s Committee on Fee-Generating Appointments (Committee Report). The committee had been established in response to a finding by this court\u2019s Commission to Study Racial and Ethnic Bias in the Courts, \u201cthat the procedures for fee-generating appointments used by the courts do not provide equal opportunities for minority appointments.\u201d See Committee Report, <em>supra </em>at l.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> According to the judge, the charitable trusts under the Crabtree will, \u201cwith <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>large fee payments and trustee appointments in the discretion of the judge, are a quintessential example of the \u2018big money estate cases\u2019 with \u2018old boy network\u2019 potential that the amended Rule 1:07 was intended to address.\u201d While the judge correctly identifled the source of the January, 1999, amendment to rule 1:07, and the concerns it was designed to correct, he misapprehended the applicable scope of our rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-10\">At first glance, the rule appears to have wide application. The rule\u2019s preamble is broad (\u201cto assure that all fee-generating appointments made by the courts of the Commonwealth are made on a fair and impartial basis\u201d), as is the directive contained in rule 1:07 (3) (\u201c[ejach court appointment shall be made from the list maintained pursuant to section [2] of this rule, except as otherwise provided in section [4]\u201d). But when read as a whole, the rule does not contemplate that the terms \u201cfee generating appointment\u201d and \u201ccourt appointment\u201d apply to every trustee appointed by a judge pursuant to G. L. c. 203, \u00a7 5. These terms refer only to those appointments that must be recorded in the appointment docket pursuant to rule 1:07 (5).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b204-22\">S.J.C. Rule 1:07 (5) (k) explicitly excludes from the appointment docket, and therefore from the scope of rule 1:07, those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>trustee appointments \u201cprayed for by name\u201d in any petition seeking appointment. See S.J.C. Rule 1:07 (5) (1) (\u201cThe appointment of [a] . . . trustee . . . shall not be entered on the appointment docket except as required by section [5] [k]\u201d). Accord S.J.C. Rule 1:07 (1), as appearing in 403 Mass. 1303 (1989), superseded by S.J.C. Rule 1:07, as appearing in 430 Mass. 1315 (1999) (docket shall include only those trustees who are \u201ca person other than the person, if any, whose appointment was prayed for in a petition, pleading, or written motion, or in cases in which such petition, pleading, or motion does not pray for the appointment of any specific person\u201d). The import of rule 1:07 is that when a judge is required to exercise discretion to identify a new trustee (in other words when no trustee is \u201cprayed for by name\u201d),<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> the judge must exercise that discretion in an even-handed manner. See S.J.C. Rule 1:07, preamble (purpose of rule is \u201cto assure that all fee-generating appointments made by the courts of the Commonwealth are made on a fair and impartial basis with equal opportunity and access for all qualified candidates for appointments,\u201d while avoiding \u201cfavoritism and the appearance of favoritism\u201d). This is consistent with the obvious purpose of the committee and its report. See Committee Report, <em>supra </em>at 17 (recommendations \u201cdirected towards bringing to public light information on the types of appointments made by the courts and the qualifications needed to receive these appointments\u201d and establishing \u201ca regular process to provide public notice of these opportunities and a system to ensure equal opportunity for all those meeting established qualifications for appointment\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">Our rule recognizes and endorses the long-held view that \u201c[i]n naming a trustee to fill a vacancy where the instrument does not prescribe a method, the court has a wide discretionary range.\u201d <em>Wilson, petitioner, </em>372 Mass. 325, 327 (1977). Notwithstanding such discretion, our rule reflects the view that \u201cit would be folly for the judge not to pay attention to the judgment of the active trustees as to who their colleague should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>be.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 329. If every fee-generating appointment made by a judge, pursuant to G. L. c. 203, \u00a7 5, could be made only from the list of persons compiled pursuant to rule 1:07 (2), existing trustees could never exercise any \u201cjudgment\u201d as to who their colleagues should be. Nothing in the committee\u2019s report, or the findings and recommendations of the commission to study racial and ethnic bias in the courts, on which the report relies, or the 1999 amendments to the rule, warrants that conclusion.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b206-11\">Of course, a judge always retains the discretion to reject a nominee \u201cprayed for by name\u201d where the nominee is \u201cjustifiably found to be unsuitable\u201d or there exist \u201cfacts strongly indicative of the necessity of a different appointment.\u201d <em>Lovejoy, petitioner, </em>352 Mass. 660, 665 (1967).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> But it is far from clear that the judge refused to appoint Swift on that basis. The judge did note that he knew \u201cnothing of [Swift\u2019s] qualifications or suitability to serve,\u201d explaining that \u201c[w]hen the instant petitians to fill the vacancies in the trust were presented to the Court at a hearing, the petitioners provided no information about their nominee, Mr. Swift, except his name and that he is of Osterville in the County of Barnstable.\u201d A judge is always free to examine the qualifications of a trustee \u201cprayed for by name.\u201d But until the judge undertakes that examination, it would be difficult for the proponents to anticipate the need to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>establish the nominees\u2019 qualifications.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> It is undisputed that Swift was available to testify at the hearing on the trastees\u2019 petitian, but the judge made no inquiry concerning his qualifications. Had the judge harbored reservations concerning the qualificatians of Swift, he should have made inquiry about those qualifications and given the trustees an opportunity to present them. As we shall explain, it may be that the reason for the judge\u2019s reservation about Swift had less to do with Swift\u2019s qualifications than the fact of his nomination by Naughton and Harney.</p>\n<p id=\"A-6\">In rejecting Swift, the judge also noted that Swift\u2019s name did not \u201cappear on the fist of names\u201d issued pursuant to role 1:07. While the judge\u2019s statement may be nothing more than an explanation as to why in his view he could not appoint Swift, his statement suggests that a candidate not listed under rule 1:07 is not qualified to serve as a trustee appointed under G. L. c. 203, \u00a7 5. Any such inference is incorrect. Those who may seek appointment as trustees \u201cby the court,\u201d i.e., when a judge himself must identify the trustee, must meet the qualifications established from time to time pursuant to role 1:07. See note 11, <em>supra. </em>But there are surely countless trustees who now serve, and who will in the future be nominated to serve (\u201cprayed for by name\u201d), who will not apply to have their names placed on the role 1:07 list. Among other reasons, such trustees may have no interest in serving as trustees for trusts with which they have no connection. Our role was not intended as a Statewide licensing or qualification scheme for all trustees appointed under G. L. c. 203, \u00a7 5.</p>\n<p id=\"AmE\">Although it was error to reject Swift because his name was not included on the role 1:07 list, there may be other reasons for the judge to reject Swift. From his related order, which we address below, it may well be that the judge had valid concerns about the trustees\u2019 performance, such that their nomination of Swift alone was sufficient to disqualify him. If the judge were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>to conclude that the current trustees have not carried out their fiduciary duties in accordance with the settlor\u2019s wishes or have paid themselves fees in excess of their entitlement as trustees, he would be acting well within his discretion to reject their nominee; their \u201cjudgment\u201d would merit no consideration. Here, the judge made no findings to that effect, and we cannot conclude from the record whether such findings would be warranted.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> We therefore remand this matter to the probate judge for further consideration of the trustees\u2019 petition.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b208-12\">3. <em>Trustee statement of services. </em>We consider next the trustees\u2019 challenge to the order that they be required to provide a certifled statement of their services. The judge initially explained that the trustees were fiduciaries whose names were required to be recorded in the appointment docket pursuant to rule 1:07 (5) and that they had been paid without prior approval as required by rule 1:07 (7). In his later, August 10, 2001, memorandum on the trustees\u2019 motion for rehearing, the judge elaborated. He acknowledged that \u201cat first blush\u201d the express terms of the rule seemingly excluded the trustees because Naughton and Harney had been \u201cprayed for by name in a petition, pleading, or written motion,\u201d and were not \u201crequired\u201d to be so recorded. S.J.C. Rule 1:07 (5) (k). Nevertheless, the judge reasoned, the purpose of that exclusion was \u201cto excuse from some provisions of the rule those fiduciaries who were selected by true parties in interest rather than by a judge.\u201d As we explained earlier, rule 1:07 was not intended to apply to all appointments made pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>G. L. c. 203, \u00a7 5, and the judge\u2019s view to the contrary is neither supported by the express terms of the rule nor required to give effect to our rule\u2019s intent.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> That, however, does not end our inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">The judge also ruled that even if rule 1:07 did not apply to Naughton and Harney, he would, in any event, have entered the same order against the trustees \u201cin light of the fees reported in the . . . trust accounts.\u201d The judge had the full authority to do so. As the judge correctly recognized, he has broad statutory authority to supervise trustees, <em>Matter of the Trust Under the Will of Fuller, </em>418 Mass. 466, 484 (1994) (Probate Court retains \u201ctraditional supervisory control codified at G. L. c. 206, \u00a7 1, over trustees it has appointed\u201d),<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> and to examine them \u201cunder oath . . . upon any matters relative to [their] accounts.\u201d G. L. c. 206, \u00a7 3. To the extent that the judge harbored doubt as to the fair value of the trustees\u2019 services,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> or doubt whether they had carried out their fiduciary duties to effectuate the will of the settlor, which he clearly did, it was entirely proper to require <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>the trastees to submit a sworn itemized time and expense statement pursuant to G. L. c. 206, \u00a7 3.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">4. <em>Appointment of guardian ad litem. </em>We now turn to the remaining issue: whether it was proper for the judge to appoint a guardian ad litem. In <em>so </em>doing, the judge relied on both G. L. c. 206, \u00a7 24 (5),<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> and the court\u2019s \u201cinherent\u201d power.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> In the circumstances, the judge\u2019s appointment of a guardian ad litem was proper.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b210-11\">The judge had both the statutory authority to appoint a guard-ion ad litem, and authority to do so under the Probate and Family Court\u2019s roles. Pursuant to G. L. c. 206, \u00a7 24 (5), a guardian ad litem may be appointed if there are interested persons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>who have not been notified or if the identity of all interested persons has not been ascertained. Here, it was not possible to identify or notify all potential beneficiaries of the trust. The section also provides that \u201cwhere the court deems special circumstances exist,\u201d the court may order trustees to give notice of their accounts \u201cto such persons as the court may direct.\u201d Here, the judge identified two special circumstances warranting notice to the guardian ad litem: \u201cthe size of the fees paid by the trustees to themselves\u201d and \u201cthe fact that both accounts have beginning income balances and ending income balances in excess of $300,000 despite an apparent requirement of the trust that all income be used semi-annually.\u201d The trustees do not contest that these circumstances constitute \u201cspecial circumstances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">Additionally, G. L. c. 206, \u00a7 30, provides for the appointment of a guardian ad litem to represent persons with contingent interests in trust funds,<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> and the judge had clear statutory authority to proceed as he did. Moreover, under Rule 5 of the Rules of the Probate and Family Court (2003), a judge may appoint a guardian ad litem to represent the interests of minors, legally incompetent persons, or persons unborn or unascertained, \u201cif notice has been given on the pending matter.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> In short, both statutory provisions and the rule expressly contemplate the appointment of a guardian ad litem in these circumstances.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">The trustees respond that it was error to appoint a guardian ad litem where, as here, the beneficiaries\u2019 interests had ef<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>fectively been represented by the Attorney General. See <em>Claflin, petitioner, </em>336 Mass. 578, 583-584 (1958) (\u201cNo need here appears for the appointment of a guardian ad litem to duplicate . . . work . . .\u201d);<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> <em>Lynde </em>v. <em>Vose, </em>326 Mass. 621, 623-624 (1951) (\u201cTo pay compensation to [the guardian ad litem] for services would be a waste of the money of the estate\u201d because \u201c[t]he guardian ad litem or next friend could represent no interest\u201d).<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> The trustees add that the appointment of a guardian ad litem usurps the Attorney General\u2019s authority to enforce the administration of public trusts pursuant to G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 8.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">The Attorney General\u2019s statutory duties do not displace the Probate and Family Court\u2019s \u201ctraditional supervisory control, codified at G. L. c. 206, \u00a7 1, over trustees it has appointed.\u201d <em>Matter of the Trust Under the Will of Fuller, </em>418 Mass. 466, 483-484 (1994) (appointment of guardian ad litem uncontested, where guardian ad litem was to report on adequacy of settlement reached between Attorney General and trustees and where guardian ad litem\u2019s recommendations contradicted those of Attorney General).<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> See <em>Wilson, petitioner, </em>372 Mass. 325, 330 (1977) (Attorney General\u2019s special role in connection with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>public trusts does not \u201cprovide[] a basis for displacing the court\u2019s traditional discretion under G. L. c. 203, \u00a7 5, with respect to charitable trusts\u201d).<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> A judge is not bound by a settlement reached between acting trustees and the Attorney General, see <em>Matter of the Trust Under the Will of Fuller, supra, </em>or obligated to appoint a nominee proposed by the Attorney General, <em>Wilson, petitioner, supra. </em>In like fashion, a judge is not precluded from exercising his authority because the Attorney General has had the opportunity to object to an account, but has not done so. See <em>Quincy Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>317 Mass. 195, 198 (1944) (\u201cWhere a court has once taken jurisdiction and has become responsible to the public for the exercise of its judicial power so as to do justice, it is sometimes the right and even the duty of the court to act in some particular sua sponte\u201d; it is \u201c[especially appropriate\u201d for the court to do so in \u201ca case in which an appointee of the court to a position of trust is found unworthy or unsuitable\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">Although the judge properly exercised his authority to appoint a guardian ad litem, we are cognizant that payment for the services of a guardian ad litem may in some cases substantially diminish funds available to cony out the purpose of a charitable trust. The Attorney General may have scrutinized the trustees\u2019 fifth and sixth accounts and concluded that their fees were not excessive and that the trustees had complied with the terms of the Crabtree trusts. But it may be, as the judge noted, that for reasons of resource allocation or otherwise, the Attorney General did not undertake a detailed review of the activities of these trustees, sufficient to satisfy the concerns of the judge. In the future, before a guardian ad litem is appointed to review the activities of the trustees of a charitable trust, the Attorney General should be informed of a judge\u2019s intent to make the appointment, and of his reasons for doing so. The Attorney General should be provided with a reasonable date by which to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>register an objection, if any, to such appointment. If the Attorney General does not respond within the designated period, the judge may conclude that there is, in fact, no opposition to the appointment of a guardian ad litem, and that the Attorney General has no objection to the expenditure of charitable trust resources to pay for such services.</p>\n<p id=\"Ax9\">5. <em>Conclusion. </em>We vacate the judge\u2019s order denying the petition to appoint Swift as the successor trustee and his order appointing Potter as trustee of the Crabtree trusts and remand that matter for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

The judge had made the same reference in his August 10, 2001, order directing the trustees to file a statement of services pursuant to rule 1:07 (7). See Part 3, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b204-33\">The early versions of what became rule 1:07 apparently were promulgated to address a possible problem that certain judges were routinely making varipus fee-generating appointments to a small number of attorneys. To monitor and expose any such abuse, the rule established a system to record in one docket fee-generating appointments made by judges, which could be reviewed by the public. Consistent with the purpose of the rule at that time, trustees \u201cprayed for by name\u201d were not required to be recorded on that docket.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-38\">The January, 1999, amendments, on the other hand, were promulgated to address a different issue: the exclusion of women and minorities from those appointments. See Committee Report, <em>supra </em>at 1, 17. To this end, the January, 1999, amendments supplemented the rule with new provisions concerning preappointment and appointment procedures. The amendments did not broaden the scope of trustee appointments encompassed by the rule.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b205-6\">RuIe 1:07 does not apply, of course, only to the appointment of trustees. A wide range of court appointments, including those explicitly listed in (a) through (k), as well as \u201cany other fee-generating appointment not compensated by [the Committee for Public Counsel Services] and not otherwise excluded by this section,\u201d are governed by the rule. S.J.C. Rule 1:07 (5) (1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b206-26\">Nor does the amended rule alter the requirement that the judge give \u201cspecial consideration\u201d to the views of the Attorney General. See <em>Wilson, petitioner, </em>372 Mass. 325, 330 (1977). Rule 1:07 did not negate <em>Wilson, petitioner, supra, </em>or <em>Lovejoy, petitioner, </em>352 Mass. 660, 665 (1967).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b206-30\">Analogizing to <em>Lovejoy, petitioner, supra, </em>the trustees argue that it is reversible error for the judge to substitute his own judgment for that of the Attomey General who, they argue, implicitly assented to Swift\u2019s appointment by not filing an objection. See <em>id. </em>at 665 (where \u201cthe beneficiaries [had united] on a qualified trustee ... [it was] arbitrary and capricious action and an abuse of discretion for the court to appoint a stranger\u201d). Assuming, arguendo, that the Attorney General\u2019s silence here constituted assent, we have elsewhere rejected the crux of the trustees\u2019 argument. See <em>Wilson, petitioner, supra </em>at 329 (Attorney General\u2019s nominee not entitled to same deference as beneficiaries\u2019 nominee in <em>Lovejoy, petitioner, supra, </em>because, among other things, compatibility between beneficiaries of private trust and trustees was \u201chighly important\u201d). Cf. <em>Matter of the Trust under the Will of Fuller, </em>418 Mass. 466, 483-484 (1994) (probate judge not bound by settlement reached between trustees and Attorney General).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"Axe\">While there are specific qualifications for individuals seeking to be appointed by a judge from \u201cthe court list\u201d maintained pursuant to rule 1:07, see note 11, <em>supra, </em>there is no analogous rule that would require similar qualificatians of others. Here, the preprinted petitions submitted by Naughton and Harney did not prompt them to provide information concerning their candidate\u2019s qualifications. See R.M. Rodman, Procedural Forms \u00a7 1774 (5th ed. 1990).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b208-29\">In the judge\u2019s separate memorandum concerning his decision to appoint a guardian ad litem, he stated that \u201cquestions [about the trustees\u2019 administration of the fund] . . . appear from the face of [the] account.\u201d It was \u201cnot clear\u201d to the judge that all fund income had been used in accordance with the terms of the will and questioned both \u201cthe size of the fees paid by the trustees to themselves and the fact that both [the trustees\u2019 fifth and sixth] accounts have beginning income balances and ending income balances in excess of $300,000 despite an apparent requirement of the trust that all income be used semiannually.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b208-38\">If, on remand, the judge denies the trustees\u2019 petition to appoint Swift foreasons pertaining to the trustees\u2019 performance (i.e., if the judge concludes that the performance of the trustees is so questionable that any candidate of theirs would be suspect), it would be futile for the trustees to propose an alternate candidate. In such circumstances, the judge would be required to follow the procedures outlined in rule 1:07 to select and appoint a successor trustee.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b209-6\">In the judge\u2019s August 10, 2001, memorandum directing the trustees to file sworn written statements, the judge suggested that the scope of rule 1:07 may have some limitations. Specifically, he concluded that the \u201cprayed for by name\u201d exclusion applied only where \u201cthe trust instrument specifies a method for successor trustees to be nominated; or the donor or the donor\u2019s family is still legally interested in the trust and entitled to notice; or beneficiaries specified by the trust instrument, or their issue or appointees as defined in the trust instrument, remain legally interested and entitled to notice.\u201d This conclusion reflected the judge\u2019s view that rule 1:07 was intended to apply where \u201cfiduciaries . . . were selected by true parties in interest rather than by a judge.\u201d In both his August 10, 2001, memorandum and his November 30, 2001, decision refusing to appoint Swift, the judge\u2019s conclusions regarding the scope of rule 1:07 rested on a distinction he drew \u201cbetween trusts in which specified beneficiaries continue to be interested . . . and those trusts in which there are no remaining specified beneficiaries.\u201d The judge was apparently persuaded that rule 1:07 was meant to apply in the latter cases (where the appointment \u201clies within the judge\u2019s discretion\u201d), but not the former (where, depending on the circumstances, the judge may have less discretion as to whom to appoint).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b209-7\">While it is undisputed that both Naughton and Harney were each \u201cprayed for by name\u201d by the then trustees of the Crabtree trusts, they were nonetheless appointed by the Probate Court pursuant to G. L. c. 203, \u00a7 5.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b209-8\">Because of \u201cthe size of the fees paid by the trustees to themselves,\u201d the judge wished \u201cto determine if their fee compensation was excessive.\u201d To this end, the judge\u2019s instructions to the guardian ad litem included a direction that the guardian ad litem review, among other things, \u201ctrustee compensation.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b210-15\">As the judge recognized, he also had an affirmative duty to decline to \u201capprove compensation beyond the fair value of services rendered.\u201d See S.J.C. Rule 3:09, Canon 3 (B) (4), as appearing in 382 Mass. 809 (1981). Because of our resolution of the trustees\u2019 claim, we need not consider the guardian ad litem\u2019s argument that the judge had the authority, pursuant to Mass. R. Prof. C. 1.5, as amended, 432 Mass. 1301 (2001), to investigate, sua sponte, whether the trustees\u2019 fees were excessive.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b210-22\">General Laws c. 206, \u00a7 24, provides, in pertinent part: \u201cUpon application for the allowance of an account filed in probate court such notice as the court may order shall be given by publication . . . and by delivering or mailing by registered mail a copy of the citation to the attorney general if there are public charitable interests . . .
