(Shield), was severely and permanently injured when the backhoe truck tire he was repairing exploded. The plaintiffs sued and eventually settled Tremblay\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation claim against Shield for $750,000. They also reached settlements with all other parties except A. Brace Simpson. The Superior Court allowed Simpson\u2019s motion for summary judgment with regard to negligence claims brought against him, holding that Simpson was entitled to coemployee immunity under G. L. c. 152, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (Act). The plaintiffs appealed and we granted their application for direct appellate review.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Because we conclude that these were work-related injuries that are governed exclusively by workers\u2019 compensation, we agree with the Superior Court that Simpson is protected by the Act\u2019s coemployee immunity provision, G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 15.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We therefore affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\u2019<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\"><em>Facts. </em>In the early or mid-1980\u2019s, Simpson, the vice-president in charge of operations and a one-third shareholder of Shield, bought a backhoe track at a salvage yard auction and delivered it to Shield\u2019s facility in Dudley for use at Shield. In the years since that purchase, the track has been used mainly for excavation work in Shield\u2019s business. At all relevant times Simpson knew that the backhoe had wheels with multi-piece rims, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>was generally aware of the risk of injury from exploding rims when a tire was being inflated.</p>\n<p id=\"A84\">Simpson received an order to remove railroad ties on Shield property from Shield\u2019s president, and relayed the instructions to his son, Ryan Simpson, also an employee of Shield. On November 12, 1997, Ryan Simpson was supervising David Tremblay, a maintenance worker at Shield, as Tremblay was changing a tire on the backhoe truck to prepare the truck for use in removal of the railroad ties on Shield\u2019s property. The backhoe\u2019s multi-piece tire rim explosively separated, striking Tremblay in the forehead. As a result of this injury, surgeons had to remove a large part of Tremblay\u2019s forehead, a substantial portion of the left frontal lobe of his brain, and his right eye. Tremblay is now legally blind and suffers from permanent and severe brain injury. The parties do not dispute that Tremblay was injured while working for Shield.</p>\n<p id=\"A4Z\">The plaintiffs sued, and eventually they settled Tremblay\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation claim against Shield for $750,000 and their product liability claims against the manufacturers of the truck and the locking ring mechanism incorporated into the tire. The plaintiffs also sued Simpson individually, alleging that Simpson was negligent because he (1) failed adequately to train and supervise Tremblay, (2) did not warn of the known danger posed by the multi-piece tire rims and provide protective gear to those who foreseeably would service the truck, and (3) transferred the backhoe truck to Shield with knowledge of its dangerous condition and failed to warn others or otherwise address the known danger. Simpson moved for summary judgment on the ground that Tremblay\u2019s negligence claims were barred by the coemployee immunity provision of the Act. G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 15. The Superior Court judge allowed Simpson\u2019s motion on all three counts. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-34\">\n<em>Discussion.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AJ\">1. <em>Granting of summary judgment.</em></p>\n<p id=\"A9V\">a. <em>Summary judgment standard. </em>The Superior Court judge properly allowed the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The grant of summary judgment will be upheld on appeal when, \u201cviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, all material facts have been established and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. . . . [The appellate court] may consider any ground supporting the judgment.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Augat, Inc. </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>410 Mass. 117, 120 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">b. <em>Coemployee immunity provision of G. L. c. 152, \u00a715. </em>Workers\u2019 compensation is the exclusive remedy against employers and coemployees who commit tortious acts \u201cwithin the course of their employment and in furtherance of the employer\u2019s interest.\u201d <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Nutter, McClennen &amp; Fish, </em>45 Mass. App. Ct. 212, 216 (1998). An employee is thus immune from tort liability under the Act, provided that his or her negligence that resulted in another employee\u2019s injury occurred in the course of employment. <em>Mulford </em>v. <em>Mangano, </em>418 Mass. 407, 410-411 (1994). <em>Saharceski </em>v. <em>Marcure, </em>373 Mass. 304, 306 (1977). Co-employees, however, may be sued for tortious acts committed outside the course of employment and for reasons \u201cunrelated to the interest of the employer.\u201d <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Nutter, McClennen &amp; Fish, supra </em>at 216, citing L. Locke, Workmen\u2019s Compensation \u00a7 10.5, at 273 (Nason &amp; Wall Supp. 1995). See G. L. c. 152, \u00a7\u00a7 23-24. An objective test is used to assess whether the coemployee acted in the course of employment or \u201cat least in part for a job-related purpose.\u201d <em>Mulford </em>v. <em>Mangano, supra </em>at 412.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">c. <em>\u201cCourse of employment\u201d test. </em>The \u201ccourse of employment\u201d test used in workers\u2019 compensation cases is much broader than the \u201cscope of employment\u201d test applied to determine whether a master is liable for a servant\u2019s negligent acts. See <em>Mulford </em>v. <em>Mangano, supra </em>at 410-411; <em>Mendes </em>v. <em>Tin Kee Ng, </em>400 Mass. 131, 134-135 (1987); <em>Saharceski </em>v. <em>Marcure, supra </em>at 306 (implicitly rejecting narrower \u201cscope of employment\u201d test); G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 15 (see note 3, <em>supra). </em>An employee has acted in the course of employment whenever he has, on the employer\u2019s premises, engaged in conduct consistent with his contract of hire and pertinent or incidental to his employment. <em>Mulford </em>v. <em>Mangano, supra </em>at 411. Furthermore, an employee has acted in the course of employment even if he has more than one purpose for doing an act, \u201cas long as one significant purpose is related to the employment.\u201d <em>Mendes </em>v. <em>Tin Kee Ng, supra </em>at 134-135. The relevant inquiry with respect to claims against co-employees is not whether the coemployee owned the equipment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>that caused the injury, but whether, at the time of the injury, the coemployee acted in some way related to his or her employment. <em>Id. </em>at 134 (emphasizing \u201ctime of the accident\u201d as relevant time frame for coemployee immunity inquiry and focusing on purpose for employee\u2019s actions, not on ownership of instrumentality). <em>Mulford </em>v. <em>Mangano, supra </em>at 409-411 (implying that time of injury is relevant time frame for coemployee immunity inquiry). <em>Saharceski </em>v. <em>Marcure, supra </em>at 305-307 (looking only to coemployee\u2019s actions on date of accident). G. L. c. 152, \u00a7\u00a7 1-24.</p>\n<p id=\"ANe\">Under the broad \u201ccourse of employment\u201d test of employee immunity, an employee is acting within the course of employment when he provides equipment for his employer\u2019s use. We have applied coemployee immunity in a case where one employee\u2019s equipment indirectly served the employer\u2019s interest by providing the employee with transportation to and from work. <em>Mendes </em>v. <em>Tin Kee </em>Ng, <em>supra </em>at 135 (employee who struck another employee with car while arriving at work acted in course of employment). Coemployee immunity would therefore apply in a case where the instrumentality directly served the employer\u2019s interest by performing services for the employer\u2019s benefit and profit. See <em>id.; Security Roofing &amp; Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>163 F. Supp. 794, 796 (D. Mass. 1958) (recognizing that workers bring their own tools to work to further their employer\u2019s business, not theirs).</p>\n<p id=\"A7-\">The plaintiffs argue that the grant of Simpson\u2019s motion for summary judgment was erroneous because there is a genuine question whether Simpson acted in the course of his employment when he purchased the backhoe and delivered it to Shield. The plaintiffs also contend that Simpson is not entitled to the protection of the Act\u2019s coemployee immunity provision because Simpson\u2019s breach of duty occurred before Tremblay and Simpson became coemployees. In both arguments the plaintiffs\u2019 fixatian on some date earlier than the period of Tremblay and Simpson\u2019s common employment is extraneous. As we have explained above, our case law is clear that for the purposes of the Act\u2019s coemployee immunity provision, the operative time frame is the time of the accident and not some earlier date. <em>Mendes </em>v. <em>Tin Kee Ng, supra </em>at 134.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>According to the principles we have set forth above, it is irrelevant when and why Simpson purchased the backhoe. It is also of no consequence whether Simpson or Shield owned the backhoe at the time Tremblay was injured. <em>Id. </em>(focusing on \u201ccourse of employment,\u201d not on ownership). The only relevant inquiry remains whether, on the day of the accident, Simpson acted in the course of his employment when he provided the backhoe for use at Shield and ordered Tremblay to repair the backhoe without warning him of the dangers posed by its multipiece rims. <em>Id. </em>(critical inquiry is whether coemployee acted in course of employment at time of accident).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">d. <em>Conclusion. </em>Simpson acted on the orders of Shield\u2019s president and, thus, in a way significantly related to his employment when he instructed Tremblay to repair the truck. Additionally, Simpson acted to further his employer\u2019s purposes when he provided the backhoe for removal of railroad ties on Shield\u2019s property. We therefore conclude that at the time of the accident Tremblay and Simpson were coemployees, and that Simpson acted in the course of his employment in both providing the backhoe for use at Shield and ordering Tremblay to prepare the backhoe for removal of railroad ties on property of Shield. Thus, even if Simpson had been negligent in not warning Tremblay of dangers associated with the backhoe\u2019s multi-piece tire rims, the order allowing Simpson\u2019s motion for summary judgment must be upheld.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">2. <em>Denial of motion to amend complaint.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">The exclusivity provision of G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 24, prohibits a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>loss of consortium action based on \u201cany injury to the employee that is compensable under\u201d the Act. See <em>St. Germaine </em>v. <em>Pendergast, </em>411 Mass. 615, 627 (1992) (concluding that Act bars all loss of consortium suits based on injuries covered by Act). As we have explained above, Tremblay\u2019s injury is covered by the Act. Therefore, even if Tremblay and Fredette had been married at the time of Tremblay\u2019s injury, Fredette would not have been able successfully to maintain a loss of consortium claim, and we need not consider whether the right to bring a loss of consortium claim should be extended to unmarried partners. See <em>Feliciano </em>v. <em>Rosemar Silver Co., </em>401 Mass. 141 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b284-7\">The plaintiffs appealed from the entry of summary judgment and the denial of an earlier motion to amend the complaint to add a claim of loss of consortium on behalf of Fredette individually. At the time of the accident, Fredette was Tremblay\u2019s cohabiting but unmarried partner.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b284-8\">General Laws c. 152, \u00a7 15, provides in pertinent part: \u201cNothing in this section, or in section eighteen or twenty-four shall be construed to bar an action at law for damages for personal injuries . . . by an employee against any person <em>other than </em>the insured person employing such employee . . . and said insured person\u2019s employees\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b284-9\">Because of our ruling on the issue of workers\u2019 compensation coemployee immunity, we need not reach the issue of Fredette\u2019s claim for loss of consortium. See part 2, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b284-10\">We acknowledge the amici curiae briefs filed by Associated Industries of Massachusetts and New England Legal Foundation. We also acknowledge the amicus curiae brief filed by the Massachusetts Academy of Trial Attorneys.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b288-8\">The test for coemployee immunity has sometimes been expressed as an inquiry whether the coemployee, if injured in the same accident, would have been entitled to workers\u2019 compensation, and if not, then such coemployee could not be said to have acted in the course of employment. See <em>Meade </em>v. <em>Ries, </em>642 N.W.2d 237, 244 (Iowa 2002); <em>Blank </em>v. <em>Chawla, </em>234 Kan. 975, 982 (1984); <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Hutchinson, </em>453 S.W.2d 269, 270 (Ky. 1970). This is essentially the same rule that this court recognized in <em>Mulford </em>v. <em>Mangano, </em>418 Mass. 407, 409 &amp; n.2 (1994) (coemployee immunity rule under G. L. c. 152 \u201cinvolves the same \u2018course of employment\u2019 standard that determines whether an employee is acting in the course of employment and thus is entitled to workers\u2019 compensation\u201d). Here, had Simpson also been hit by the exploding tire rim, he would have been eligible for workers\u2019 compensation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b288-9\">Given our decision, we acknowledge, but need not separately address, the plaintiff\u2019s argument regarding the \u201cdual persona\u201d theory.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
