Koumaris, was convicted of a 1975 felony-murder in the first degree with armed robbery as the predicate felony, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 17, respectively.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendant appeals arguing that it was error for the Superior Court judge, who was also the trial judge, to deny his motion to suppress confessions he made to prison officials and police, and to refuse to conduct a voir dire of the jury regarding statements defense counsel made while jurors were nearby. He also argues that the prosecutor vouched for the veracity of a Commonwealth witness in closing argument, thereby committing reversible error. We have reviewed the entire record pursuant to our duty under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. We reject the defendant\u2019s claims of errors and find that the prosecutor\u2019s argument, taken in context, was not reversible error. We also conclude that there is no basis to exercise our power under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. Accordingly, we affirm the defendant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">1. <em>Facts. </em>We recite facts the jury could have found, in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, reserving certain facts for our discussion of other issues. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vinnie, </em>428 Mass. 161, 164, cert, denied, 525 U.S. 1007 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">On June 12, 1975, the victim, a twenty year old woman, was the attendant working at a Hess gasoline station in Brockton. It was Hess\u2019s policy that attendants were to keep approximately fifty dollars on their person to make change for customers, with any excess to be deposited in a floor safe.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-9\">At approximately 3:30 p.m., a witness saw a man with red hair near a public telephone inside the station. The victim also was inside the station. Sometime before 4 p.m., in the general vicinity of the station, another witness saw a man with reddish brown hair, who had bright red blood on the front of his trousers, running behind a New England Telephone building through its parking lot in the direction of a junk yard. Nearby was a stream with a bridge over it.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>The victim\u2019s body was discovered by a gasoline station patron at approximately 4 p.m. The victim suffered eighteen stab wounds, several of which were characterized as defensive wounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">The defendant confessed to the murder four times. The first confession took place in 1976. The defendant, whose hair was light red at the time, was incarcerated in the Plymouth County house of correction. He confessed to Herbert Knight, a fellow inmate who had befriended him.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The second and third confessions took place on March 8, 1998, when the defendant was incarcerated for offenses unrelated to the murder in a segregation unit at the Southeastern Correctional Center. He confessed separately to two correction officers, Jeffrey Souza and Russell Curran. The defendant\u2019s fourth confession was to State Trooper Paul Petrino and Brockton Detective Emanuel Gomes, who were assigned to investigate the confessions the defendant made to the correction officers. This last confession occurred after the defendant had received his Miranda rights and signed a waiver form.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">Each confession was essentially the same. The defendant stated that he committed a murder in Brockton. He stated that, in 1975 or 1976, at approximately 10 a.m., he stabbed a female Hess gasoline station attendant numerous times with a kitchen knife. He said the attendant was approximately twenty-four years old and had long brown hair. The defendant said that he was \u201chigh on drugs\u201d and went to the gasoline station in his mother\u2019s 1965 Chevrolet station wagon because he needed money for drugs. The defendant stated that he had to wait for a man who was in the station to leave and then went up to the attendant and demanded money. The victim said, \u201cNo,\u201d and she screamed and struggled with the defendant; she also slapped him. He took a knife out and stabbed her. The victim fell to the floor and the defendant continued to stab her until she stopped struggling and screaming. The defendant then reached into the victim\u2019s front pocket and removed approximately fifty dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">The defendant said he threw the knife away. He told the inmate that he threw it \u201cinto a river or a lake or something,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>but told the police and correction officers that he threw it into a junk yard. While being questioned by the State trooper and Brockton detective, the defendant pointed to a photograph of the victim and began to cry. The defendant accurately told one of the correction officers that two detectives investigating the case were named Gentile and Reardan, and said to the State trooper that he could not be certain it happened at 10 a.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">As a result of his confession to the State trooper and Brock-ton detective, the defendant was indicted for murder in the first degree and armed robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">2. <em>Denial of the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress. </em>The defendant argues that it was error for the judge to deny his motion to suppress the confessions to the murder because, he claims, he was subject to a \u201ccustodial interrogation\u201d when he confessed to correction officers, and the officers did not read him the Miranda warnings. The defendant also argues that his subsequent confession to Trooper Petrino was inadmissible because it was the fruit of the poisonous tree. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Brandwein, 435 Mass. 623, 628 (2002); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>White (No. 3), </em>365 Mass. 312, 314 (1974), cert, denied, 419 U.S. 1111 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">We present the facts as found by the motion judge and add, as necessary, uncontested facts from the record of the motion hearing. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Leon L., </em>52 Mass. App. Ct. 823, 824 (2001). \u201c[W]e accept the motion judge\u2019s subsidiary findings of fact absent clear error.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Yesilciman, </em>406 Mass. 736, 743 (1990). The motion judge\u2019s legal conclusion is a matter for review, especially if constitutional issues are involved. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>432 Mass. 214, 234 (2000). A judge\u2019s ruling may be reversed if the facts are clearly erroneous or if justice requires. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moon, </em>380 Mass. 751, 756 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">As noted, on March 8, 1998, the defendant was incarcerated in a segregation unit. At approximately 6 p.m., he asked Officer Souza if he could speak to an \u201cinner perimeter security\u201d (IPS) officer.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> When Souza told the defendant that no IPS officer was available, the defendant said that he wanted to speak to Souza <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>because he wanted to get something off his conscience. He also stated that he believed he was going to die imminently.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\">Following prison procedure, Souza handcuffed the defendant and took him to an interview room. The defendant confessed to the murder and signed Souza\u2019s written notes.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> After the defendant signed the notes, Souza contacted the IPS officer, Russell Curran. The defendant, again handcuffed, went with Officer Curran to an interview room, and reiterated his confession to the murder. Both correction officers stated that the defendant was calm and spoke clearly. Further, Curran knew the defendant because Curran regularly searched prisoners who, like the defendant, worked in an \u201cIndustries\u201d unit at the prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">Relying on <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Larkin, </em>429 Mass. 426, 434 (1999), the defendant argues that because he was in handcuffs \u201cthroughout the entire questioning\u201d by correction officers, which limited his \u201cability to leave the interview room,\u201d he was subject to custodial interrogation for Miranda purposes. The defendant\u2019s argument fails because, unlike the defendant in <em>Larkin, </em>the undisputed facts make clear that, in this case, the defendant was never interrogated by the correction officers. To the contrary, the defendant was not subjected to \u201ceither express questioning or its functional equivalent.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Painten, </em>429 Mass. 536, 541 (1999), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>424 Mass. 792, 796-797 (1997). The defendant initiated the entire course of events. It was only in response to his insistence that he talk to an officer that evening that Souza responded, \u201cGo ahead. Tell me what you got to say.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The defendant then proceeded to do what he had told Souza he wanted to do \u2014 get something off his conscience. Only after the defendant had confessed, did Souza ask one question (regarding the whereabouts of the knife).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">In the subsequent meeting with Officer Curran, Curran also began by asking the defendant what he wanted to say, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>asked <em>no </em>questions. The defendant later told Trooper Petrino that there was no coercion by Souza. These interactions between the defendant and the correction officers do not amount to an interrogation.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">Because the defendant was not subject to an interrogation by correction officers, Miranda warnings were not necessary.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Moreover, it follows for the same reason that the defendant\u2019s subsequent confession to Trooper Petrino was not inadmissible as the fruit of the poisonous tree. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brandwein, </em>435 Mass. 623, 628 (2002); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>White (No. 3), </em>365 Mass. 312, 314 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">In addition, although it is not raised as an issue on appeal, under our power pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, we find no error in the judge\u2019s findings that the defendant\u2019s statements were not affected by his \u201cmental illness.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">The judge did not err in admitting the defendant\u2019s confessions.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>3. <em>Voir dire of the jury. </em>The defendant claims that the judge erred when he refused to conduct a voir dire of the jury to determine whether they heard, and were affected by, comments of defense counsel they may have overheard. The defendant argues that the failure to conduct a voir dire of the jury denied him his constitutional right to a trial by an impartial jury under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution. In analyzing this issue, we provide the relevant facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">On the first day of trial, the Commonwealth presented the testimony of four witnesses: the victim\u2019s brother, the witness who discovered the victim\u2019s body at the Hess gasoline station, an ambulance attendant who performed CPR on the victim, and the witness who saw a man with red hair in the station, by the public telephone. At the conclusion of their testimony, the judge called a recess. On the way out of the court room, defense counsel was talking to another attorney. Unaware that the jurors were right behind her, defense counsel said that she did not have much with which to cross-examine the witnesses. The other attorney\u2019s response was that defense counsel was \u201cmaking [her] points.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">On returning from the recess, defense counsel told the judge what happened and asked the judge to conduct a voir dire of the jury. The judge declined and said that the comment was innocuous.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">If \u201ca judge determines that the jury may have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>exposed ... to material that \u2018goes beyond the record and raises a serious question of possible prejudice,\u2019 he should conduct a voir dire of jurors to ascertain the extent of their exposure to the . . . material and to assess its prejudicial effect.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Francis, 432 Mass. 353, 369-370 (2000), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>376 Mass. 790, 800 (1978). \u201cThe determination of potential juror prejudice is a matter within the sound discretion of the trial judge.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Federici, </em>427 Mass. 740, 747 (1998), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Samuel, </em>398 Mass. 93, 96 (1986), and G. L. c. 234, \u00a7\u00a7 26B, 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">Defense counsel\u2019s remark came after only thirty-five minutes of testimony. Defense counsel did not know if any juror actually overheard the comments. The testimony of three of the four Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses established preliminaries regarding the time the victim was found, her condition, and the Hess gasoline station\u2019s policy regarding attendants\u2019 keeping approximately fifty dollars on their person. The fourth witness testified that the attendant and a man with red hair were in the station at approximately 3:30 p.m. On cross-examination, defense counsel elicited that the fourth witness was never able to establish the identity of the man he saw that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">Given these facts (and the multiple confessions of the defendant), the testimony of these witnesses were not key to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>outcome of the trial. Furthermore, the response from the other attorney was favorable to the defendant. We cannot say, therefore, that the judge abused his discretion in determining that defense counsel\u2019s statement was \u201cinnocuous\u201d and did not affect the case, and in declining to conduct a voir dire of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">4. <em>The prosecutor\u2019s closing statement. </em>The defendant argues that the prosecutor committed reversible error by improperly vouching for the veracity of a prosecution witness during closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">At the defendant\u2019s trial, the prosecution called Herbert Knight, the inmate to whom the defendant confessed in 1976. Knight, who was \u201con the run from charges in Michigan\u201d at that time, took the information to Massachusetts authorities in hopes of receiving favorable consideration in Michigan. Although at the defendant\u2019s trial, Knight claimed that he never received anything for the information, in cross-examination, defense counsel implied that Knight had a motive to he because of his attempt to obtain consideration in his own case. In her closing, defense counsel suggested that Knight either fabricated the story or that he took advantage of the defendant and convinced him that he had killed the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">In his closing, the prosecutor made statements addressing Knight\u2019s testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-8\">\u201cLet\u2019s first analyze the statements of Herbert Knight in 1976, something he tells his friend. Well, he\u2019s a con. That\u2019s what he is, in jail looking for somebody that he can rat out on, and [the defendant] makes the mistake of talking to him and telling him what happened, and Herb Knight goes to the authorities and, of course, is his credibility in doubt? Sure it is. He\u2019s looking for a deal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-9\">\u201cBut that was in 1976. We\u2019re talking about him on the stand in 2002. He no longer is looking for a deal. This is a man that\u2019s done his time. He\u2019s living in Ware, Massachusetts. He\u2019s sixty-two years old and he gets a phone call from Trooper Petrino. What do you know about this?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-10\">This is a guy who will tell you that he wasn\u2019t treated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>right. He has motive not to tell what he knows to help law enforcement, but I suggest to you that he did what was right. <em>He told you the truth. There\u2019s credibility to what he said on that stand. </em>What he told the police in 1976, you may question because of his motive to lie.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">Defense counsel objected to the argument as improper vouching for Knight\u2019s credibility. The judge stated that the argument concerned Knight\u2019s motive to lie and, in substance, overruled the objection. We examine the defendant\u2019s claim for prejudicial error. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pearce, All </em>Mass. 642, 644 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">It is never proper for an attorney to vouch for a witness\u2019s credibility. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chavis, </em>415 Mass. 703, 713 (1993), and cases cited. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ciampa, </em>406 Mass. 257, 265 (1989). However, it is permissible to comment and draw inferences regarding the evidence at trial, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chavis, supra, </em>and cases cited, or to point to the logical reasons a witness\u2019s testimony should be believed, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rolon, </em>438 Mass. 808, 816 (2003). Here defense counsel put Knight\u2019s credibility at issue during both her cross-examination of him and her closing argument. As discussed, she argued that Knight had either fabricated the story or convinced the allegedly weak-minded defendant that he had committed the crime. Therefore, \u201cthe prosecutor legitimately could defend the credibility\u201d of Knight. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chavis, </em>415 Mass. 703, 714 (1995). See <em>id. </em>at 713 (\u201cprosecutor may make a fair response to an attack on the credibility of a government witness\u201d). Moreover, \u201c[cjlosing arguments must be viewed \u2018in the context of the entire argument, and in light of the judge\u2019s instructions to the jury and the evidence at trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Allison, </em>434 Mass. 670, 687 (2001), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Viriyahiranpaiboon, </em>412 Mass. 224, 231 (1992). Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Raymond, </em>424 Mass. 382, 391-392 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">Taken in context, the prosecutor\u2019s statements, \u201cHe told you the truth. There\u2019s credibility to what he said on that stand,\u201d were not improper vouching. It is clear from the context that the prosecutor\u2019s argument was focused on Knight\u2019s motive to he. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Marangiello, </em>410 Mass. 452, 465 (1991), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stone, </em>366 Mass. 506, 516 (1974) (prosecutor\u2019s statement in support of witnesses\u2019 credibility appropriately \u201cbased on the demeanor and motive of the witnesses and the consistency of their stories\u201d). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hardy, </em>431 Mass. 387, 396 n.6 (2000) (\u201cHe\u2019s telling you the truth\u201d not improper vouching).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">Moreover, the judge informed the jury that closing arguments were not evidence, told them repeatedly that they were to decide the facts based solely on the testimony and the exhibits,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and charged the jury regarding what they could consider in determining the credibility of the witnesses. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pearce, supra </em>at 645, and cases cited. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Raymond, supra </em>at 392 (no objection from defense counsel). Taken in context together with the judge\u2019s instructions to the jury, we find that the prosecutor\u2019s statements were not prejudicial error.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">5. <em>Conclusion. </em>For the reasons stated, we find no merit to any of the issues raised on appeal by the defendant, and decline to exercise our power under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b426-10\">The armed robbery charge was placed on file due to sentencing on the felony-murder charge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b427-7\">As discussed, <em>infra, </em>Knight reported this information to authorities in 1976, with no apparent consequences for the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b428-9\"> \u201cInner perimeter security\u201d investigates internal complaints within the prison.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b429-7\">At trial, Souza testified that he removed the handcuffs so the defendant could sign the notes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b429-8\">The motion judge mischaracterized this as a question, stating, \u201cSouza asked [the defendant] what he wanted to say.\u201d The transcript makes clear that Souza, rather than asking a question, made a declarative statement, and the defendant did not challenge Souza\u2019s statement. In his brief, the defendant also presents this statement in the declarative, not the interrogative.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b430-7\">Because of our ruling, the issue of custody need not be addressed other than to note that where the defendant, already incarcerated in a segregation unit, was handcuffed and taken, in the presence of a single officer, to an interview room to have a conversation the defendant requested, such routine use of handcuffs did not operate to create a \u201ccustodial\u201d setting \u201cbeyond that imposed by the confines of ordinary prison life.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Larkin, </em>429 Mass. 426, 435 (1999), quoting <em>People </em>v. <em>Margolies, </em>125 Misc. 2d 1033, 1041 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b430-8\">At the suppression hearing, the defendant raised the possibility that he may have been suffering from mental illness at the time of his confession. The motion judge made the following findings, which we conclude are not clearly erroneous. The defendant introduced no expert or expert opinion in support of his claim, but the judge was given, for review, the defendant\u2019s Department of Correction medical and mental health records for March, 1998. The judge found that \u201cdespite [the defendant\u2019s] questionable mental stability on the day before the confession and before receiving medications, there is no evidence that his mental condition affected his cognitive abilities such that his statements should be suppressed.\u201d The judge found that the defendant was interviewed by an evaluator on the day before the confession, and denied that he was having either \u201cauditory or visual hallucinations,\u201d or that he was \u201csuicidal.\u201d The evaluator noted that the defendant was \u201coriented in all spheres\u201d and that the defendant stated that his behavior (including \u201cbanging his head\u201d) \u201cwas a consequence of his being a \u2018Bom again Christian.\u2019 \u201d The defendant started receiving medication the day after the confession. The judge found, \u201cEven after being on medication for several days, [the] defendant never recanted his confession.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b430-9\">In addition, the only two defense witnesses testified that in November, 1999, the defendant apologized for murdering their daughters, which was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>trac. The jury were warranted in discounting these admissions, especially as they occurred after his confession to the victim\u2019s murder.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b431-10\">The exact exchange was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-11\">The clerk: \u201c[Defense counsel], you have a matter to bring to the Court\u2019s attention, ma\u2019am?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-12\">Defense counsel: \u201cYes, Judge, as I was breaking just after \u2014 just after we broke for lunch, I was leaving the courthouse with [another attorney] who was in back of me, and on the way out, I was talking to her, unfortunately, about the case without being aware that there were jurors coming out right behind me, and I don\u2019t know if they overheard anything or not. I do remember that at one point I said to her, and I think it\u2019s maybe all I said about the case, that I didn\u2019t have much to cross-examine and her response was that I was making my points, and although I did not see the juror, specifically, she felt that one of the jurors at least overheard what we had said, because at that point she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>had turned around and saw that they were walking by us.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-8\">The judge: \u201cSounds like an innocuous statement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-9\">Defense counsel: \u201cIt may very well have been, Your Honor. It certainly was not intended to be overheard by the jurors, however, and I don\u2019t know whether it would have any effect on them, but I think it has to be put on record, and I leave it to the Court to decide . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-10\">The judge: \u201cIf you didn\u2019t discuss anything other than that. . . ?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-11\">Defense counsel: \u201cI don\u2019t remember saying anything more than that about the case itself.
