We reversed those convictions because of ineffective assistance of counsel, based on trial counsel\u2019s failure to raise the defense of lack of criminal responsibility due to the defendant\u2019s psychologi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>cal disorders combined with his use of alcohol. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Roberio, </em>428 Mass. 278 (1998). On retrial, in January, 2000, the defendant was convicted of the same offenses. His murder conviction was premised on theories of felony-murder,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> deliberate premeditation, and extreme atrocity or cruelty. In the instant appeal, the defendant contends that admission of the prior recorded testimony of two witnesses who testified at his first trial, Kenneth Jones and Rebecca Jennings, deprived him of his right to confront the witnesses against him in violation of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights. He alleges that the Commonwealth did not satisfy the requirements for the admissibility of prior recorded testimony because neither witness was \u201cunavailable.\u201d As to Jennings, he claims further that, because counsel at the first trial failed to focus on the issue of the defendant\u2019s mental capacity as affected by his disorders and alcohol, her cross-examination was constitutionally insufficient. The defendant also requests that we exercise our authority under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, to reduce the degree of murder. We affirm the convictions and decline to exercise our authority under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">1. <em>Facts and procedural history. </em>Because the key issue at trial was the defendant\u2019s mental condition, the facts of the underlying crime may be succinctly stated. We summarize those facts the jury could have found. On the evening of July 29, 1986, the defendant and Michael Eagles<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> entered the Middle-borough trailer home of the victim, a seventy-nine year old man who lived alone and kept a large amount of cash in his trailer. The following day, his body was discovered, savagely beaten with a blunt force object. Several bones, including his spine, were fractured, and he had been strangled with his own pillow case. He was alive at the time these injuries were inflicted. Cash, a shotgun, and miscellaneous personal property had been stolen from his home. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>Several weeks before the victim\u2019s death, the defendant had asked a friend to \u201cdo a break with him ... to get. . . money\u201d from an old man who had a \u201clot of money\u201d and \u201cdidn\u2019t believe in banks.\u201d On the evening of the murder, the defendant and Eagles were driven to an area near the victim\u2019s trailer. The defendant said that he \u201cwas going to break into some man\u2019s house,\u201d and asked for a return ride about one hour later. On the return trip, the defendant was shirtless and wet (it had been raining) and Eagles was seen holding a roll of money. During this ride, Rebecca Jennings, the victim\u2019s granddaughter (who was not implicated in the crimes), was picked up and given a ride home. She noticed the shirtless defendant in the car but did not converse with him. Kenneth Jones, a friend of Eagles, testified regarding Eagles but said he did not see the defendant at all that day. The testimony of the last two witnesses, Jennings and James, was admitted as prior recorded testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">On the day after the murder, the defendant was observed with a fifty dollar bill and revealed the details of the murder to a friend. He also had the friend drive him back to the area of the trailer, where he retrieved the victim\u2019s shotgun and a metal box. The police later found these items. A State police fingerprint expert testified that a fingerprint on a beer stein found in the victim\u2019s kitchen was that of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-9\">At the second trial, a neuropsychologist testifying for the defendant opined that the defendant had an attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, an \u201coppositional defiant disorder,\u201d and a learning disability, and that, when those conditions were exacerbated by alcohol use, the defendant lacked the substantial capacity to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b267-10\">2. <em>Prior recorded testimony. </em>To satisfy the confrontation clause, the Sixth Amendment establishes a rule of necessity, i.e., that the prosecution either produce, or demonstrate the unavailability of, the declarant whose statement it wishes to use against the defendant. The judge must be satisfied that the Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>monwealth has made \u201ca good faith effort to produce the witness at trial.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Siegfriedt, </em>402 Mass. 424, 427 (1988). Once unavailability is shown, the proponent of the recorded testimony must demonstrate that the hearsay is reliable. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bohannon, </em>385 Mass. 733, 742-743 (1982). Reliability depends on whether the testimony was shown to be reliable when given and whether the evidence of that testimony is sufficiently accurate. As to the first component, as a matter of constitutional law, the indicia of reliability are satisfied if the prior testimony was given under oath, the defendant was represented by counsel, counsel had opportunity to cross-examine the witness, and the issue at both judicial proceedings is similar. <em>Id. </em>at 742.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">The prosecutor informed the judge at the outset of the trial that Jones was a fugitive from justice in Florida wanted on a probation violation warrant issued in that State, and that the Commonwealth had been unable to locate him. Massachusetts State troopers had contacted his probation officer and a deputy sheriff in Florida and were seeking to locate him, but he had moved from his known address. A State trooper spoke with Jones\u2019s girl friend, who did not provide any useful information. His probation officer received no information regarding Jones\u2019s location in conversations with his mother and brother. A stake out of a bar in Florida which an informant indicated to authorities Jones would visit on New Year\u2019s Eve (trial began later in January) was unavailing. All information tended to show that Jones was addicted to \u201ccrack\u201d cocaine and living on the street with no permanent address. Defense counsel conceded that the Commonwealth had made a good faith effort to locate Jones. The judge so concluded and allowed the Commonwealth\u2019s motion to admit his prior recorded testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">The situation changed during trial. On the fourth day of trial, as the Commonwealth was planning to rest its case, the prosecutor informed the judge that he had learned on the previous night that, as the result of a traffic stop in Florida, Jones had just been arrested on the probation violation. The prosecutor further stated if he were to proceed under the Uniform Act to Secure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>the Attendance of Witnesses from Without a State in Criminal Proceedings (interstate act), see G. L. c. 233, \u00a7\u00a7 13A-13D, it would take some time to complete the required paperwork and procedures.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The judge concluded that the witness \u201cremainfed] unavailable,\u201d and admitted his prior testimony from the first trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">Although the defendant claims that mere inconvenience should not result in a determination of unavailability and that an attempt could have been made to expedite the interstate procedure to obtain Jones\u2019s early appearance, it was certainly within the judge\u2019s discretion to determine that it was impractical to compel the jury to wait the number of days (if not weeks) needed to produce Jones as a live witness. It is the combination here of the obviously adequate steps taken by the Commonwealth prior to trial to locate Jones, together with the fact that he was not found until midtrial, that resulted in satisfaction of the Commonwealth\u2019s burden of establishing unavailability. Given the Commonwealth\u2019s pretrial diligence, the prosecutor was not obligated to undertake at midtrial the cumbersome procedures of the interstate act or suffer a mistrial.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">With respect to Rebecca Jennings, the defendant claims both that she was not unavailable and that her prior recorded testimony was not reliable. Jennings was hospitalized suddenly for kidney stone surgery on the second day of the trial. When the Commonwealth was about to rest its case on Friday, January 14, 2000, the prosecutor informed the judge that Jennings\u2019s doctor had stated by letter that Jennings would not be released from the hospital until the following Tuesday, January 18 (the day when the evidence was expected to and did close), and would be unable to attend court until January 25. The judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>ruled that she was unavailable and admitted her testimony from the first trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">The defendant maintains that this was another instance of mere inconvenience, not unavailability. But this was a sudden operation, not a scheduled surgery, and a doctor had indicated that Jennings could not testify until one week after the evidence concluded. Thus, this presented a classic case of unavailability. The judge again acted within her discretion in determining that Jennings was unavailable.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-12\">The defendant argues that Jennings\u2019s prior testimony is not \u201creliable\u201d because there was no opportunity for cross-examination. Although the defendant was represented by counsel who cross-examined Jennings at the first trial, present counsel claims that the cross-examination was ineffective because it did not focus on the defendant\u2019s mental state as exacerbated by the use of alcohol. The question presented is whether, when there has been a determination that counsel was ineffective in an earlier trial, the defendant had an adequate opportunity to cross-examine the witness on that occasion,' so that admission of the witness\u2019s recorded testimony at the second trial is not fundamentally unfair.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-24\">We considered this precise issue in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Childs, 413 Mass. 252 (1992). In that case, the defendant\u2019s original conviction of murder in the second degree was reversed due to ineffective assistance of counsel: the defense attorney had failed to keep from the jury evidence of the defendant\u2019s stale (see G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 21, First and Second) and pardoned (see G. L. c. 127, \u00a7 152) convictions. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Childs, </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. 33 (1986), <em>S.C., </em>400 Mass. 1006 (1987), <em>S.C., </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. 64 (1991), <em>S.C., </em>413 Mass. 252 (1992). At retrial, it was uncontroverted that the defendant had shot and killed the victim. The only issue was whether the killing was intentional or accidental. The defendant testified that the gun went off accidentally, and the only other eyewitness on the matter was George DeMattia, Jr. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Childs, </em>413 Mass. 252, 253 (1992). He was unavailable at the second trial, and the judge admitted his prior recorded testimony supporting the Commonwealth\u2019s theory of an intentional killing. Clearly, De-Mattia\u2019s \u201ctestimony was critical.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 254. On appeal, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>defendant argued that he did not have an adequate opportunity to cross-examine DeMattia because his counsel, who had been determined ineffective as to other aspects of the defense, was defective in his cross-examination of DeMattia. Accordingly, he claimed that the testimony \u201clacked sufficient indicia of reliability to satisfy the defendant\u2019s right of confrontation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 263.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">The \u201crelevant\u201d principle, the <em>Childs </em>court noted, <em>id., </em>is that a defendant \u201cis not entitled under the confrontation clause to a cross-examination that is \u2018effective in whatever way, and to whatever extent, the defense might wish.\u2019 <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Siegfriedt, </em>[402 Mass. 424, 429 (1988)] .... \u2018The decisions of [the Supreme] Court make it clear that the mission of the Confrontation Clause is to advance a practical concern for the accuracy of the truth-determining process in criminal trials by assuring that the \u201ctrier of fact [has] a satisfactory basis for evaluating the truth of the prior statement.\u201d \u2019 <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bohannon, </em>[385 Mass. 733, 746 (1982)]. . . . See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tanso, </em>411 Mass. 640, 646-649 (1992). \u2018Cross-examination, to pass muster under the confrontation clause, does not have to be a perfect cross-examination.\u2019 <em>Id. </em>at 648.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Childs, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">Although defense counsel asserted several deficiencies in the prior cross-examination of DeMattia (failure to introduce evidence of a pending charge against him, failure to introduce a prior inconsistent statement, and the repetitious elicitation of testimony harmful to the defendant), <em>id. </em>at 263-264, the court determined that defense counsel had conducted a \u201clengthy\u201d cross-examination that attacked DeMattia\u2019s \u201csincerity, perceptions . . . and memory.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 264. The court concluded that even should they deem the cross-examination less than perfect, the proposes of the confrontation clause were met. Hence, the judge\u2019s conclusion at the second trial, that DeMattia\u2019s recorded testimony was sufficiently reliable to be admitted, was not error. In other words, the fact that counsel was ineffective in regard to one issue does not taint all aspects of the prior trial. Counsel may be deemed ineffective in one respect while his conduct as to other matters may be adequate. The United States Supreme Court has reached a similar result in accord with Federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>constitutional principles: as long as there was \u201cadequate opportunity to cross-examine\u201d at the first trial and counsel \u201cavailed himself of that opportunity,\u201d the prior testimony has sufficient \u201cindicia of reliability.\u201d <em>Mancusi </em>v. <em>Stubbs, </em>408 U.S. 204, 216 (1972). We glean from these cases that while a \u201cperfect\u201d cross-examination is not required, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Childs, supra </em>at 263, the confrontation clause requires an adequate cross-examination or a reasonable strategic decision to forgo such questioning. Counsel must have the opportunity for cross-examination, and counsel may be ineffective if the opportunity to cross-examine was not utilized.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-14\">But that rule does not affect the situation before us. Jennings\u2019s testimony did not relate to the reason counsel was deemed ineffective; furthermore, counsel had the opportunity to cross-examine her with respect to the testimony she offered. Counsel at the first trial was found to be ineffective for failure to present evidence of the defendant\u2019s mental condition and the effect of intoxication on that mental condition. Jennings\u2019s testimony had no bearing on that issue. She testified only to the weather and the defendant\u2019s physical appearance (shirtless and wet) just after the murder. (Her direct testimony was merely two pages long; her cross-examination was another one-half page.) Her testimony, if believed, established only the defendant\u2019s presence in the vicinity of the crime near the time of the murder, nothing more. The ineffective assistance concerned the defendant\u2019s alleged mental condition; the completely unrelated testimony of Jennings is not affected by that finding. \u201cThat some of the conduct of . . . defense counsel in the first trial was deemed ineffective does not . . . taint the entire cross-examination.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Childs, </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. 64, 70 (1991). Defense counsel had the opportunity to cross-examine Jennings and exercised it. Neither the right to confront witnesses nor the right to cross-examine was impinged here.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-37\">The defendant claims that his motive or purpose in cross-examining Jennings at the first trial was not identical to his mo-five or purpose in cross-examining her at the retrial, because his original counsel did not mount a defense based on the defendant\u2019s mental condition. He claims that our law requires that the prior testimony of the now unavailable witness must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>have been \u201cin a proceeding addressed to substantially the same issues as in the current proceeding, with reasonable opportunity and similar motivation on the prior occasion for cross-examination of the declarant by the party against whom the testimony is now being offered.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ortiz, </em>393 Mass. 523, 532 (1984), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Meech, </em>380 Mass. 490, 494 (1980). However, to decide whether the defendant\u2019s motive to cross-examine at the earlier proceeding is similar to his motive to cross-examine at the current trial, \u201c[t]he issue on which the testimony was introduced in the [earlier] proceeding as well as the purpose for which the testimony was offered must be substantially similar to the issue and purpose for which the same testimony is offered at the subsequent . . . trial.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ortiz, supra, </em>quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Canon, </em>373 Mass. 494, 512 (1977), cert. denied, 435 U.S. 933 (1978) (Liacos, J., dissenting). Here, the issue on which the testimony was introduced by the Commonwealth at the first trial was the same as the issue for which it was offered by the Commonwealth at the second trial: to prove the defendant\u2019s presence in the vicinity of the crime at the relevant time. Concerning the requirement that the prior testimony must have been given in a proceeding addressed to substantially the same issues as the present proceeding, in both trials the issue was the defendant\u2019s culpability. When the defendant\u2019s theory of defense changes because ineffective assistance has been replaced by acceptable representation, the right of the Commonwealth to present testimony of an unavailable witness on other subject matter cannot logically be affected.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">The defendant has not shown that his right to confrontation has been violated. Rather, he seeks an opportunity to question Jennings on a subject on which she did not testify, theorizing that that testimony would be beneficial to the defense.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We reject the defendant\u2019s implicit invitation to adopt a per se rule that, if failure to present a certain defense is the basis for reversal of a conviction, cross-examination of each witness must have focused on that subject or that witness\u2019s prior rec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>orded testimony is not admissible. This is particularly true concerning a witness whose testimony is as restricted in scope as that of Jennings. There was no abuse of discretion or other error of law in admitting the prior recorded testimony in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">3. <em>Relief pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. </em>We have reviewed the entire record and conclude that there is no reason to exercise our power under G.
