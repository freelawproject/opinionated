The issue for review is whether, in light of <em>Messing, Rudavsky &amp; Welicky, P.C. </em>v. <em>President &amp; Fellows of Harvard College, </em>436 Mass. 347 (2002) <em>(Messing); Patriarca </em>v. <em>Center for Living &amp; Working, Inc., </em>438 Mass. 132 (2002) <em>(Patriarca); </em>and other authority, Mass. R. Prof. C. 4.2, as amended, 437 Mass. 1303 (2002), ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>plies to former employees. A Superior Court judge held that it did, and entered protective orders prohibiting the plaintiff\u2019s counsel from privately making contact with the organizational defendants\u2019 former employees without permission of the court or defense counsel. We conclude that rule 4.2 does not apply to former employees. Accordingly, we vacate the protective orders.</p>\n<p id=\"Ajs\">1. The background of this case is as follows. The plaintiff, James G. Clark, as administrator of the estate of Frank D. Clark (Clark), brought a wrongful death action against Beverly Health and Rehabilitation Services, Inc.; Beverly Enterprises, Inc.; and Beverly Enterprises-Massachusetts, Inc. (collectively, Beverly Health); and the individual defendants. The complaint alleged that Clark died as the result of an overdose of morphine administered by the defendant Carmen Vanhome, a nurse at the Hermitage, where Clark resided. The Hermitage is a health and rehabilitation center owned by Beverly Health. The complaint further alleged that after Vanhome administered the overdose of morphine, she was ordered by the defendant, Dr. Henry M. Wieman, to administer a morphine antidote, Narcan, to Clark. Wieman, who has since died and is represented by a personal representative, then allegedly ordered Vanhorne to cease administering the Narcan. The plaintiff maintains that Wieman\u2019s actions and understaffing at the Hermitage significantly contributed to Clark\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"ACg\">In the course of discovery, the plaintiff\u2019s counsel made contact with Sharyn Lee Rennie, a nurse formerly employed at the Hermitage who was on duty the night that Clark died. The judge found, and the plaintiff does not dispute, that Rennie was \u201cdirectly involved\u201d in the subject matter of the litigation. The plaintiff\u2019s counsel identified himself to Rennie, identified the parties, and described the general nature of the case. See Mass. R. Prof. C. 4.3, 426 Mass. 1404 (1998). After ascertaining that Rennie was unrepresented and was willing to speak with him without an attorney, the plaintiff\u2019s lawyer had at least one substantive conversation with Rennie concerning her memory of relevant events. Subsequently, Rennie was deposed. She chose to appear without counsel. At the deposition, both the plaintiff\u2019s and Beverly Health\u2019s attorneys had the opportunity to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>question her under oath, and Beverly Health\u2019s attorney posed several questions to Rennie concerning her prior contacts with the plaintiff\u2019s lawyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">Shortly after Rennie\u2019s deposition, Beverly Health\u2019s attorneys sought a protective order to prevent the plaintiff\u2019s counsel from ex parte contact with former Beverly Health employees. The plaintiff opposed the motion and filed a cross motion for an order allowing such contacts and prohibiting Beverly Health\u2019s counsel from soliciting former employees of the organization as clients. A Superior Court judge entered a protective order prohibiting the plaintiffs counsel from contacting former Beverly Health employees unless defense counsel were present or permission were granted by defense counsel or the court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, the judge expressly granted leave to the plaintiff to renew his motion to make contact with former Beverly Health employees, if our decision in the then pending <em>Patriarca </em>case so permitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">While the <em>Patriarca case </em>was pending, we decided the <em>Messing </em>case, which we shall discuss later in this opinion. The plaintiff filed a motion to reconsider the protective order on the ground that it contravened our holding in <em>Messing. </em>The judge summarily denied the motion. The plaintiff unsuccessfully sought interlocutory relief in the Appeals Court pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 118, first par. The plaintiff then petitioned this court pursuant to G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, to vacate the Superior Court orders. A single justice granted relief from the orders \u201cto the extent that the blanket prohibition against contact with any former employee is inconsistent with the decisions in\u201d <em>Messing </em>and <em>Patriarca. </em>She reserved and reported the case on the question whether, in light of the <em>Messing </em>and <em>Patriarca </em>decisions, rule 4.2 \u201chas any applicability to former employees of a defendant corporation who were directly involved in the subject matter of the litigation and questioning them about the subject matter of the litigation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">2. We have recently examined the scope of rule 4.2, which is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>also known as the \u201cno-contact rule.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In <em>Messing, supra, </em>we considered the extent to which the no-contact rule permits ex parte communications between an opposing attorney and the current employees of an organization represented by counsel. In <em>Patriarca, supra, </em>we considered the application of the no-contact rule to former employees who were not represented by the organization\u2019s counsel, were not alleged to have committed the wrongful acts alleged in the litigation, and were without authority to bind the organization in matters concerning the litigation. We expressly left open the broader question of the general applicability of rule 4.2 to former employees. <em>Id. </em>at 134. That question confronts us here.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">The judge, relying on the then current text of comment [4] to rule 4.2, concluded that the no-contact rule barred ex parte contact between the plaintiffs lawyer and former employees of Beverly Health, because:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-6\">\u201cGiven that the plaintiff\u2019s counsel is contacting the defendants\u2019 former employees who were directly involved in the subject matter of the litigation and questioning them about the subject matter of the litigation, it is clear that the employees\u2019 statements could constitute admissions and/or their acts or omissions could be imputed to the corporate defendants.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">The judge\u2019s conclusions are not supported by the text of rule 4.2, the text of comment [4], or by the purposes the rule is intended to serve.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">Rule 4.2 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-9\">\u201cIn representing a client, a lawyer shall not communicate about the subject of the representation with a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>person the lawyer knows to be represented by another lawyer in the matter, unless the lawyer has the consent of the other lawyer or is authorized by law to do so.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">The language is unambiguous. Rule 4.2 limits the circumstances in which a lawyer may communicate ex parte with a person whom the lawyer knows to be represented by counsel. While the rule prohibits a lawyer from making ex parte contact with a former employee whom counsel knows to be represented, see <em>Patriarca, supra, </em>at 136 n.6, it neither prohibits nor purports to regulate private contacts between an adverse attorney and the organization\u2019s former employees as such.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-9\">Beverly Health\u2019s attempt to bring former employees within the ambit of the no-contact rule by way of comment [4] is unpersuasive.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> If anything, comment [4] emphasizes that only current employees, and only certain kinds of current employees, properly fall within the prohibitions of the no-contact rule. As revised in light of our holding in <em>Messing, supra, </em>comment [4] applies rule 4.2 to prohibit a lawyer\u2019s ex parte contact \u201conly\u201d with three categories of employees whose interests are closely aligned with the organization in the dispute: \u201cthose agents or employees [1] who exercise managerial responsibility in the matter, [2] <em>who are alleged to have committed the wrongful acts </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number><em>at issue in the litigation, </em>or [3] who have authority on behalf of the organization to make decisions about the course of the litigation\u201d (emphasis supplied).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> There can be little doubt that categories (1) and (3), both of which employ the present tense (\u201cwho exercise,\u201d \u201cwho have authority ... to make decisions\u201d), refer to employees and agents who have an ongoing relationship to the represented organization, that is, who are current employees or agents. Beverly Health does not appear to argue otherwise. Rather, Beverly Health argues that, because the second category of prohibited employee is described in the past tense, it therefore includes former employees. Because the composition of the second category of employee was not affected by our holding in <em>Messing, supra, </em>Beverly Health contends that category (2) pertains to Beverly Health\u2019s former employees, and the protective order must stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">A commonsense reading of the comment refutes this argument. First, category (2) is not free standing. It is a clause that modifies the phrase \u201cthose agents or employees.\u201d By definition, <em>former </em>agents or employees at one time were, but no longer are, \u201cagents or employees.\u201d To conclude otherwise would fold former constituents of the organization into its current composition; an illogical result. Second, the use of the past tense in category (2) merely reflects the common assumption that the current agent or employee\u2019s allegedly wrongful conduct will have occurred prior to the filing of the complaint (\u201calleged to have committed\u201d).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">The purposes of rule 4.2 would not be served by including <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>former employees within its reach. Rule 4.2 exists \u201cto protect the attorney-client relationship and prevent clients from making ill-advised statements without counsel of their attorney.\u201d <em>Messing, supra </em>at 358. See <em>Patriarca, supra </em>at 136-137. In the context of organizational entities, it aims to balance, on the one hand, a litigant\u2019s need for information and, on the other, an organization\u2019s need to protect its legitimate interests. <em>Id. </em>at 137. An organization\u2019s attorney-client relationship is appropriately protected when the no-contact rule is construed to prohibit ex parte communication with employees \u201cwho are so closely tied with the organization or the events at issue that it would be unfair to interview them without the presence of the organization\u2019s counsel.\u201d <em>Messing, supra </em>at 359. Preventing the disclosure of unfavorable facts merely because they happen to have occurred in the workplace is not a legitimate organizational interest for purposes of applying rule 4.2. <em>Id. </em>at 358, quoting <em>Dent </em>v. <em>Kaufman, </em>185 W. Va. 171, 175 (1991) (no-contact rule does not exist \u201cto protect a corporate party from the revelation of prejudicial facts\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">It stands to reason that, if including all current employees within the ambit of the no-contact rule would unfairly tip the balance of the rule in the organization\u2019s favor, the imbalance would be exacerbated by including former employees and agents merely because they may have had some involvement in the events at issue. As we emphasized in <em>Messing, </em>rule 4.2 protects only the attorney-client relationship, and not the underlying facts. <em>Messing, supra </em>at 359. See Curley <em>vs. </em>North American Man Boy Love Ass\u2019n, No. Civ. A. 00-10956-GAO (D. Mass. Mar. 31, 2003) (construing rule 4.2 in light of our holding in <em>Messing, </em>and ruling that \u201cformer member of an organization . . . does not become a present \u2018client\u2019 \u201d of organization\u2019s attorney \u201csolely because the person\u2019s own acts done, when the person was a member, might later be a basis for holding the organization liable\u201d). See P.J. Liacos, M.S. Brodin, &amp; M. Avery, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>Massachusetts Evidence \u00a7 13.4.4, at 781-783 (7th ed. 1999) (distinguishing attorney-client communications from facts).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">Indeed, exclusion of former employees furthers both the specific and the more general purposes of rule 4.2. It must be remembered that rule 4.2 is but one part of a comprehensive system of laws and regulations designed to hold counsel to the highest professional standards in our adversary system. Within that system, pretrial (including precomplaint) discovery plays an essential role. It is the phase in which material facts are discovered, issues are narrowed as theories of the case are tested, rejected, or refined, and the parties and their attorneys have the opportunity to assess the strengths and weaknesses of their case with an eye toward both trial and the negotiation of settlement. Courts have long recognized that informal interviews are an exceptionally efficient means for the meaningful gathering of facts. They are generally more conducive to full disclosure and far less costly than the more structured processes of formal discovery, or even informal investigation with opposing counsel present. See <em>Niesig </em>v. <em>Team </em>I, 76 N.Y.2d 363, 372 (1990) (\u201cCostly formal depositions that may deter litigants with limited resources, or even somewhat less formal and costly interviews attended by adversary counsel, are no substitute for such off-the-record private efforts to learn and assemble, rather than perpetuate, information\u201d). See also <em>Cram </em>v. <em>Lamson &amp; Sessions Co., Carlon Div., </em>148 F.R.D. 259, 261 (S.D. Iowa 1993); Siguel <em>vs. </em>Trustees of Tufts College, Civ. A. No. 88-0626-Y (D. Mass. Mar. 12, 1990). Moreover, in cases where witness testimony is more central than documentary testimony, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>a ban such as that proposed by Beverly Health might inhibit the vindication of a party\u2019s rights because the litigant\u2019s counsel could not be certain that the pleadings are sufficiently grounded in facts to meet counsel\u2019s obligations of truthfulness to the tribunal. See <em>Kaveney </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>97 F. Supp. 2d 88, 94 (D. Mass. 2000); <em>Niesig </em>v. <em>Team I, supra </em>at 372.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">Former employees may be a useful source of meaningful information, because they may feel less directly tied to the employer\u2019s interests and therefore more willing to discuss informally what they know. At the same time, these employees may still have economic and other ties to the organization that would make them reluctant to speak freely in the presence of the organization\u2019s attorneys, even in an informal setting. In effeet, immunizing former employees from all ex parte interviews would permit the organization to monitor the flow of nonprivileged information to a potential adversary at the expense of uncovering material facts. Fairness in our established system of adversary representation would be the casualty. See <em>Niesig </em>v. <em>Team I, supra </em>at 371 (\u201cThe broader the definition of \u2018party\u2019 in the interests of fairness to the corporation, the greater the cost in terms of foreclosing vital informal access to facts\u201d). Much less drastic options, such as appropriately tailored protective orders, and its own formal and informal interviews with former employees, are available to protect Beverly Health\u2019s attorney-client and investigative interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-24\">Beverly Health suggests unethical conduct, a priori, on the part of any opposing counsel who may seek or conduct an ex parte interview with a former employee. We reject this notion. Although rule 4.2 does not prohibit a lawyer from making contact with former employees of a represented corporation, \u201ccounsel must, of course, be assiduous in meeting other ethical and professional standards found outside rule 4.2.\u201d <em>Patriarca, supra </em>at 139. Without limitation, counsel conducting the ex parte interview must pay particular attention to avoid transgressing Mass. R. Prof. C. 4.1, 426 Mass. 1401 (1998), governing a lawyer\u2019s duty of truthfulness to a third party; Mass. R. Prof. C. 4.3, 426 Mass. 1404 (1998), governing a lawyer\u2019s dealings with unrepresented persons; and Mass. R. Prof. C. 4.4, 426 Mass. 1405 (1998), requiring the lawyer to refrain from using unfair <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>or illegal tactics to obtain evidence. See Patriarca, <em>supra </em>at 139-141 &amp; nn. 9, 10. Further, counsel must also be careful to avoid violating applicable privileges or matters subject to appropriate confidences or protections.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Existing attorney disciplinary procedures should adequately address any less than scrupulous professional conduct. Our holding today follows the weight of authority on the matter.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>3. Beverly Health has not demonstrated that the class of former employees included in the protective orders, or any of them, is either represented by counsel or has any relationship to the organization other than that of former employee or former agent. Because neither the text of rule 4.2 or of comment [4], nor the purposes to be served by the rule, permits the application of rule 4.2 to former employees, the protective orders should not have issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">4. The orders of the Superior Court entered on June 25, 2001, and May 6, 2002, are vacated. The single justice will remand the case to the Superior Court for the entry of an order denying Beverly Health\u2019s motion for a protective order and for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b292-8\">The protective order also provided: \u201cIn the event the plaintiff needs to introduce evidence at trial obtained through interviews with former employees of [Beverly Health], plaintiff must first request permission from this Court through a motion in limine.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b293-10\">We reject, as lacking in merit, Beverly Health\u2019s threshold argument that this case does not deserve review. To the contrary, the case is particularly appropriate for review under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3. First, the plaintiff, whose motion for reconsideration and petition for interlocutory appellate review were denied, has no other pretrial avenue of relief available. It would be difficult, if not impossible, for him to demonstrate on posttrial appeal that the outcome of the case was materially affected by his lack of unimpeded access to former Beverly Health employees. Second, the question before us has broad implications for the administration of justice and for the conduct of attorneys throughout the Commonwealth. See <em>Messing, supra </em>at 351.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b294-15\">Rule 9.1 (h) of the Massachusetts Rules of Professional Conduct, 426 Mass. 1432 (1998), defines \u201c[p]erson\u201d to include \u201ca corporation, an association, a trust, a partnership, and any other organization or legal entity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b294-17\">Rule 4.2 was adopted on June 9, 1997, became effective January 1, 1998, and its comment [4] was amended effective June 5, 2002, in response to our decision in <em>Messing, </em>in a manner we describe, <em>infra. </em>Rule 4.2 is identical to the American Bar Association\u2019s Model Rule 4.2.

Frequently, a former employee may have interests adverse to that of the former employer. A blanket rule that would require the former employee to accept the organization\u2019s representation would deny that individual the right to an attorney of the person\u2019s choice, <em>Patriarca, supra </em>at 136 (attorney may not appear for another without that person\u2019s consent), and may involve the corporation\u2019s counsel in conflicts of interest. See Mass. R. Prof. C. 1.7, as amended, 430 Mass. 1301 (1999); Mass. R. Prof. C. 1.8, 426 Mass. 1338 (1998).

Mich. 1992) (\u201cThe majority of courts have held that Rule 4.2 does not apply to any former employee\u201d); <em>Nessig </em>v. <em>Team I, supra </em>at 368; Larkin v. United States, No. Civ. A. 01-0527 (E.D. La. Oct. 9, 2002) (\u201cRule 4.2 does not apply to former employees\u201d); Siguel vs. Trustees of Tufts College, Civ. A. No. 88-0626-Y (D. Mass. Mar. 12, 1990) (\u201cThe mere fact that a former employee is a prospective witness does not trigger\u201d no-contact rule). See generally ABA Annotated Model Rules of Professional Conduct 406-408 (4th ed. 1999), and cases cited. Our conclusion also accords with other authority. See, e.g., Restatement (Third) of the Law Governing Lawyers \u00a7 100 comment b (2000); 2 G.C. Hazard &amp; W.W. Hodes, The Law of Lawyering \u00a7 4.2:107, at 739 (Supp. 1994) (no-contact rule \u201cdoes not address communications with <em>former </em>agents and employees, and technically there should be no bar\u201d [emphasis in original]). The conclusion is also consistent with the position long maintained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>by the ABA, which drafted the rule, see ABA Committee on Ethics and Professional Responsibility Formal Op. 91-359 (1991) (rule 4.2 does not apply to former employees and comment \u201cgives no basis for concluding that such coverage was intended\u201d), and made explicit in the organization\u2019s proposed model rules and comments. See ABA Center for Professional Responsibility, Ethics 2000 Commission, comment [7] to Rule 4.2 of the Proposed Model Rule of Professional Responsibility (\u201cConsent of the organization\u2019s lawyer is not required for communication with a former constituent\u201d). Proposed comment [7] also attempts to clarify the permitted scope of the ex parte contact with an additional statement, as follows: \u201cIn communicating with a current or former constituent of an organization, a lawyer must not use methods of obtaining evidence that violate the legal rights of the organization.\u201d See Massachusetts Bar Association, Committee on Professional Ethics Opinion No. 02-3 (\u201cFormer agents or employees are not \u2018agents or employees\u2019 of an organization\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
