L. c. 71, \u00a7 42, seventh par., to displace teachers without such status. The Appeals Court, in an unpublished memorandum and order under its rule 1:28, modified and affirmed on other grounds the Superior Court judgment and remanded the case for a determination of remedy. <em>Lyons </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Dedham, </em>56 Mass. App. Ct. 1113 (2002). We granted the defendants\u2019 application for further appellate review. Because we conclude that there were no proper grounds for vacating the arbitration award, we vacate the judgment entered in the Superior Court, and order that judgment be entered confirming the arbitration award pursuant to G. L. c. 150C, \u00a7 11 <em>(d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">We summarize the relevant undisputed facts and lengthy procedural history. The plaintiffs, Anne Lyons and Pauline Turner, were both employed as \u201cChapter I teachers\u201d in the Dedham public schools. \u201cChapter I\u201d is a federally funded program that provides supplemental instruction to low achieving elementary and middle school students. To that end, Chapter I teachers work with small groups of designated students in reading and mathematics.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">Each Chapter I teacher is required to have a bachelor\u2019s degree in education, a Massachusetts Department of Education certification as a teacher, a separate certification in reading, and at least two years of classroom teaching experience. It is undisputed that Turner and Lyons both had the requisite qualifications. Turner was certified in elementary education. She was an elementary school teacher from September, 1956, through the end of the 1963 school year, when she \u201ctook time off to raise her family.\u201d In the fall of 1985, she began substitute teaching, and was hired as a Chapter I teacher in Dedham in January, 1986. Except for a brief period in 1986, Turner was employed as a Chapter I teacher until she was laid off in 1994 due to budget cuts. Lyons was certified in elementary education, as well as in English and social studies (for grades seven through twelve). She taught junior high school English for two years starting in 1960. After that, she stopped teaching, acquired <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>a master\u2019s degree in education, and raised her family. In 1980, Lyons was hired as a Chapter I teacher, and worked in that capacity until she was laid off in 1995, also due to a reduction in funding.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">When Turner was notified that she would be laid off, she informed the superintendent that she had \u201cprofessional teacher status\u201d (formerly known as tenure)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and that she intended to displace or \u201cbump\u201d an elementary classroom teacher who did not have such status. See G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42, seventh par. (teacher with professional teacher status \u201cshall [not] be laid off pursuant to a reduction in force or reorganization if there is a teacher without such status for whose position the covered employee is currently certified\u201d). The superintendent declined to recognize that Turner had professional teacher status. Turner filed a complaint in the Superior Court claiming the defendants violated her statutory \u201cbumping rights.\u201d A Superior Court judge dismissed the complaint in 1994, concluding that Turner\u2019s sole remedy under the statute was arbitration. Turner appealed, and the Appeals Court affirmed and ordered that the case be remanded to arbitration. <em>Turner </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Dedham, </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. 354 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">Meanwhile, in 1995, Lyons received notification that she would be laid off at the end of the school year, due to budget reductions. Lyons informed the superintendent that she intended to exercise her \u201cbumping rights,\u201d but he refused to recognize her status. Lyons filed for arbitration to resolve her claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">Turner and Lyons had separate arbitration proceedings. After each had completed four days of hearings, the parties agreed that the arbitrators would confer and issue a joint decision. In July, 1998, the arbitrators concluded that Turner and Lyons were not \u201cteachers\u201d within the meaning of G. L. c. 71, \u00a7\u00a7 41 and 42, and therefore did not have \u201cprofessional teacher status,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>or the privileges associated with such status. In reaching their decision, the arbitrators compared the qualifications and characteristics of Chapter I teachers with those of teachers in the \u201cUnit A\u201d collective bargaining unit, which included classroom teachers.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The arbitrators concluded that \u201c[w]hile there are some similarities between Chapter I teachers and a variety of Unit A positions, on balance the jobs have been, and are, very different.\u201d In particular, the arbitrators considered differences in the hiring process, evaluation procedures, salary structure, duties and responsibilities, and collective bargaining units.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">Turner and Lyons filed a complaint in the Superior Court to vacate the joint arbitration award and for a declaration that they were \u201cteachers\u201d pursuant to G. L. c. 71, \u00a7\u00a7 41 and 42. A judge in the Superior Court vacated the arbitration award pursuant to G. L. c. 150C, \u00a7 11 (a) (3), because he concluded that the award violated public policy. In an amended judgment, the judge remanded the case to the original arbitrators to determine an appropriate remedy. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">1. The arbitrators\u2019 decision is \u201csubject to judicial review as provided in [G. L. c. 150C]\u201d (relative to collectively bargained agreements to arbitrate). G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42, sixth par. General Laws c. 150C, \u00a7 11 (a), authorizes a judge to vacate an arbitrator\u2019s award only in limited circumstances. \u201cThis court has consistently acknowledged that \u2018[o]ur review of an arbitrator\u2019s award is limited in scope.\u2019 \u201d <em>Higher Educ. Coordinating Council/Roxbury Community College </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Teachers\u2019 Ass\u2019n/Mass. Community College Council, </em>423 Mass. 23, 27 (1996), quoting <em>School Comm. of Holbrook </em>v. <em>Holbrook Educ. Ass\u2019n, </em>395 Mass. 651, 654 (1985). \u201cTh[is] policy of limited judicial review is reflective of the strong public policy favoring arbitration . . . .\u201d <em>Plymouth-Carver Regional School Dist. </em>v. <em>J. Farmer &amp; Co., </em>407 Mass. 1006, 1007 (1990). The only potential grounds for vacating the award in this case is G. L. c. 150C, \u00a7 11 (a) (3), which applies when \u201cthe arbitrators exceed[] their powers or render[] an award <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>requiring a person to commit an act or engage in conduct prohibited by state or federal law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">2. As a preliminary matter, we reject the plaintiffs\u2019 argument that this case is not ripe for appellate review. General Laws c. 150C, \u00a7 16, authorizes six circumstances in which a party may appeal from a court order pertaining to arbitration proceedings. See <em>School Comm. of Agawam </em>v. <em>Agawam Educ. Ass\u2019n, </em>371 Mass. 845, 846 (1977). Clause (5) authorizes appeals from a judge\u2019s \u201corder vacating an award without directing a rehearing.\u201d G. L. c. 150C, \u00a7 16 (5). Here, the Superior Court judge ordered the arbitrators\u2019 award to be vacated, declared that the plaintiffs were teachers entitled to exercise statutory bumping rights, and remanded the case \u201cto the original arbitrators\u201d to determine a remedy. Although the judge opined that \u201cfurther arbitration proceedings [were] necessary to determine an appropriate remedy,\u201d he did not \u201cdirect[] a rehearing.\u201d Thus, we conclude that this appeal is proper under G. L. c. 150C, \u00a7 16 (5). Contrast <em>Suffolk County Sheriff\u2019s Dep\u2019t </em>v. <em>AFSCME Council 93, AFL-CIO, Local 1134, </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. 473, 474 (2000) (dismissing appeal from judgment that vacated arbitration award and ordered a rehearing before a new arbitrator). In support of our conclusion, we note that the purpose underlying G. L. c. 150C, \u00a7 16, which is that arbitration should proceed without interruption from an appeal, see <em>School Comm. of Agawam </em>v. <em>Agawam Educ. Ass\u2019n, supra </em>at 847-848, would not be served if this case were remanded to determine an appropriate remedy. Moreover, because we conclude that it was error to vacate the award, it would \u201cneedlessly frustrate the administration of justice,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chatfield-Taylor, </em>399 Mass. 1, 3 (1987), to require additional proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">3. A judge should allow a motion to vacate an arbitration award if the arbitrator did not have authority to resolve the dispute. See G. L. c. 150C, \u00a7 11 (a) (3) (judge shall vacate award if \u201cthe arbitrators exceeded their powers\u201d). See also <em>Higher Educ. Coordinating Council/Roxbury Community College </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Teachers\u2019 Ass\u2019n/Massachusetts Community College Council, supra </em>at 27, and cases cited. The plaintiffs initially argued, and the Superior Court concluded, that the arbitrators\u2019 award violated public policy. As an alterna<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>tive ground, the plaintiffs contend that the arbitrators were statutorily precluded from deciding this dispute. We address each of these arguments in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">a. An arbitration award that offends public policy \u201cis beyond the arbitrator\u2019s powers and is therefore subject to vacation under G. L. c. 150C, \u00a7 11 (a) (3).\u201d <em>Massachusetts Highway Dep\u2019t </em>v. <em>American Fed\u2019n of State, County &amp; Mun. Employees, Council 93, </em>420 Mass. 13, 16 (1995). \u201c[Bjecause the public policy \u2018doctrine allows courts to by-pass the normal heavy deference accorded to arbitration awards and potentially to \u201cjudicialize\u201d the arbitration process, the judiciary must be cautious about overruling an arbitration award on the ground that it conflicts with public policy.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bureau of Special Investigations </em>v. <em>Coalition of Pub. Safety, </em>430 Mass. 601, 604 (2000), quoting <em>E. I. DuPont de Nemours &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Grasselli Employees Indep. Ass\u2019n of E. Chicago, </em>790 F.2d 611, 615 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 853 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">The Superior Court judge\u2019s conclusion that the arbitration award violated public policy was clearly erroneous. The sole reason for his conclusion was his determination that the award \u201cclearly ignore[d] the law as stated in <em>Brophy </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Worcester, 6 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 731 (1978)\u201d (applicability of tenure to \u201clong term substitutes\u201d and \u201cfederal programs\u201d teachers). An alleged error of law is not a violation of public policy. See <em>Bureau of Special Investigations </em>v. <em>Coalition of Pub. Safety, supra </em>at 604-605 (delineating prerequisites for public policy exception), and cases cited. Nor is an error of law a permissible basis for vacating an arbitration award. <em>Concerned Minority Educators of Worcester </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Worcester, </em>392 Mass. 184, 187-188 (1984). It is well settled that \u201c[w]e do not, and cannot, pass on an arbitrator\u2019s alleged errors of law . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 187, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">b. The plaintiffs alternatively argue that the arbitrators did not have jurisdiction over their dispute because G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42, reserves such determinations to a judge.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In support of this contention, the plaintiffs rely on <em>School Comm. of Westport </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number><em>Coelho, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 614 (1998), and <em>Ballotte </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>51 Mass. App. Ct. 728 (2001).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Those cases are distinguishable and inapplicable in these circumstances. In the <em>Coelho </em>case, the Appeals Court concluded that teachers who were laid off for budgetary reasons, and who were not the subjects of performance based dismissals, could not challenge their <em>layoffs </em>in an arbitration proceeding. <em>School Comm. of Westport </em>v. <em>Coelho, supra </em>at 618-619. In reaching this conclusion, the Appeals Court noted that G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42, \u201cprecludes the application of any provision of [\u00a7\u00a7 41 or] 42 that would \u2018affect the right of a superintendent to lay off teachers\u2019 for the specified [budgetary] reasons.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 618, quoting G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42, seventh par. The court reasoned that an arbitrator ruling on the propriety of a layoff \u201ccould void the superintendent\u2019s action\u201d and thereby infringe on the superintendent\u2019s discretion to lay off teachers for economic reasons. <em>Id. </em>at 618-619. In the <em>Ballotte </em>case, the Appeals Court concluded that a teacher laid off for economic reasons could sue her employer in the Superior Court for alleged violations of her rights under G. L. c. 71, \u00a7\u00a7 41 and 42. <em>Ballotte </em>v. <em>Worcester, supra </em>at 731. In that case, the Appeals Court reasoned that nothing \u201cprevents [the plaintiff] from pursuing her statutory claims in Superior Court.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>The plaintiffs in this case have not challenged the propriety of the underlying decision to lay them off for economic reasons. Rather, they allege that the defendants violated their statutory right to displace teachers without professional teacher status. Neither the language of the statute nor the cases discussed above preclude an arbitrator from considering whether a properly laid-off instructor has statutory bumping rights. See G. L. c. 71, \u00a7\u00a7 41 and 42. An arbitrator\u2019s determination of bumping rights cannot, and does not, affect the superintendent\u2019s discretion to reduce the number of teachers.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">4. The plaintiffs contend that even if the arbitrators had authority to hear this dispute, the judiciary is responsible for independently determining whether Lyons and Turner are teachers under G. L. c. 71, \u00a7\u00a7 41 and 42. See <em>School Dist. of Beverly </em>v. <em>Geller, </em>435 Mass. 223, 230 (2001) (Cordy, J., concurring) (\u201cthe responsibility for interpreting the meaning of G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42, and the scope of the arbitrator\u2019s authority thereunder remains with the court\u201d). They further posit that anyone certified to teach is a \u201cteacher,\u201d and that their certificates suffice to obtain a judicial declaration of their status as \u201cteachers\u201d for proposes of G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 41, first par.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">General Laws c. 71 does not define \u201cteacher\u201d in the context of delineating who is eligible for \u201cprofessional teacher status.\u201d See G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 41, first par. (\u201cFor the purposes of this section, a <em>teacher . </em>. . who has served in the public schools . . . shall be entitled to professional teacher status\u201d). Prior to the passage of the Education Reform Act, St. 1993, c. 71, \u00a7 43, the Appeals Court considered, among other things, whether teachers in federally funded programs were entitled to tenure under G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 41, as amended through St. 1973, c. 847, \u00a7 6. <em>Brophy </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Worcester, </em>6 Mass. App. Ct. 731, 737 (1978). In that case, the court evaluated \u201cthe conditions of employment\u201d and \u201cthe functions of teachers holding those positions,\u201d and concluded that those teachers were sufficiently analogous to \u201cregular\u201d teachers. <em>Id. </em>Thus, the court concluded that those federally funded program teachers were entitled to tenure pursuant to the statute. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">The Education Reform Act made a number of changes to the education statutes. See, e.g., <em>School Comm. of Pittsfield </em>v. <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number><em>Educators of Pittsfield, </em>438 Mass. 753, 759-760 (2003) (describing its major features). Although it replaced the concept of \u201ctenure\u201d with that of \u201cprofessional teacher status,\u201d see note 3, <em>supra, </em>it did not change or modify the term \u201cteacher\u201d as it is used in that context. Compare G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 41, as amended through St. 1990, c. 404, \u00a7 2 (\u201c[ejvery school committee, in electing <em>a teacher </em>who has served in its public schools for the three previous consecutive school years, shall employ him to serve at its discretion . . .\u201d), with St. 1993, c. 71, \u00a7 43 <em>(\u201ca teacher . . . </em>who has served in the public schools of a school district for three consecutive years . . . shall be entitled to professional teacher status\u201d). We are not persuaded that the Legislature intended to alter the analysis of a person\u2019s status as a teacher, as that word is used in G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 41, to establish professional teacher status. Therefore, we reject the plaintiffs\u2019 contention that the only relevant inquiry in these circumstances is whether a person is certified to teach.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">In determining whether Lyons and Turner were teachers, the arbitrators analyzed the plaintiffs\u2019 \u201cconditions of employment\u201d and \u201cfunctions.\u201d See <em>Brophy </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Worcester, supra. </em>Because we conclude that the arbitrators had the authority to determine whether Lyons and Turner were teachers, we need not determine whether the arbitrators correctly applied the law to the facts of this case. See <em>School Comm. of Waltham </em>v. <em>Waltham Educators Ass\u2019n, </em>398 Mass. 703, 705 (1986), citing <em>Trustees of the Boston &amp; Me. Corp. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Autk., 363 </em>Mass. 386, 391 (1973) (\u201carbitrator\u2019s award may not be vacated on either\u201d an \u201cerror of law or ... of fact\u201d). See also <em>Goncalo </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Fall River, </em>55 Mass. App. Ct. 7, 10 (2002) (\u201cjudge properly refused to vacate\u201d arbitrator\u2019s ruling that teacher did not have professional teacher status as it was a ruling of law not subject to judicial review). Similarly, because the plaintiffs\u2019 case was fully decided by the arbitrators, we need not reach the plaintiffs\u2019 other arguments, which in any event have no merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">5. For the above stated reasons, we hold that no grounds exist for vacating the present arbitration award under G. L. c. 150C, \u00a7 11 (a). We therefore vacate the judgment of the Superior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>Court, and order that judgment be entered confirming the arbitration award.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b96-8\">Among other things, the Education Reform Act of 1993, St. 1993, c. 71, replaced the concept of \u201ctenure\u201d with \u201cprofessional teacher status.\u201d St. 1993, c. 71, \u00a7 43. Professional teacher status is granted to \u201ca teacher, school librarian, school adjustment counselor, school social worker or school psychologist who has served in the public schools of a school district for the three previous consecutive school years.\u201d G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 41, first par. It is undisputed that both Lyons and Turner served in the Dedham school district for the requisite period.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b97-7\">According to the arbitrators\u2019 decision, the \u201cUnit A\u201d collective bargaining unit included \u201cregular and special education teachers\u201d as well as \u201cspecialists\u201d in reading for grades six through eight, art, music, and physical education.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b99-8\">In its unpublished memorandum upholding the Superior Court judge\u2019s order to vacate the arbitration award, the Appeals Court concluded that arbitrators lack authority to arbitrate disputes concerning \u201cbumping rights\u201d under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42. However, because Turner\u2019s case was ordered by the court to arbitration, the Appeals Court found that the arbitrators\u2019 decision was not, \u201cstrictly speaking . . . \u2018beyond the scope of their authority.\u2019 \u201d Nevertheless, it stated that a confirmation of the arbitrators\u2019 award would \u201ccompound the error of forcing Turner to arbitration, and unjustly deprive her of the judicial determination of her status that she sought and to which she was entitled under \u00a7 42.\u201d The court further reasoned that given the circumstances of the case, it was unnecessary to distinguish Lyons\u2019s situation, even though Lyons never sought a judicial determination prior to arbitration. Because we conclude that the arbitrators had jurisdiction to decide this dispute, we need not address these conclusions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b100-9\">Both <em>School Comm. of Westport </em>v. <em>Coelho, </em>44 Mass.

The <em>Coelho </em>case, however, was decided before the joint arbitration award was issued. Ironically, the defendants contacted the arbitrators to express concern that, pursuant to Coelho's reasoning, the arbitrators did not have jurisdiction.
