L. c. 254, \u00a7 4, includes contractual interest and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees incurred in enforcing the lien. We conclude that it does not.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b744-8\">1. <em>Background. </em>This is the second appeal in a case that began as an in rem proceeding to enforce a mechanic\u2019s lien. The facts underlying the plaintiffs claim are set forth in our prior opinion, <em>National Lumber Co. </em>v. <em>LeFrancois Constr. Corp., </em>430 Mass. 663, 664-665 (2000) <em>(National Lumber I). </em>We summarize only those undisputed facts that are relevant to the issues now before us. LeFrancois Construction Corporation purchased a lot in North-borough on which it intended to construct a house and contracted with the plaintiff, National Lumber Company, to supply lumber and other materials for the house. The contract also provided that LeFrancois would pay National Lumber interest at eighteen per cent annually on any amount remaining unpaid and reasonable charges of collection including attorney\u2019s fees. National Lumber perfected a mechanic\u2019s lien by filing a notice of contract and a sworn statement that claimed an amount due for materials totaling $26,103.98. See G. L. c. 254, \u00a7\u00a7 4, 8&gt;3 <footnotemark>4</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> After the notice of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>contract was filed but before the lien was perfected, LeFrancois sold the house to the defendants, Dean and Stephanie Schwartz. National Lumber brought an action to enforce its mechanic\u2019s lien against the Schwartzes, and in <em>National Lumber </em>/, we held that it could validly enforce the lien against them, even though they were not named as defendants until after the expiration of the statutory deadline, see G. L. c. 254, \u00a7 11,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> for the filing of the plaintiffs complaint. <em>National Lumber I, supra </em>at 666.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">Thereafter, the Schwartzes obtained a dissolve lien bond in the penal sum of $26,104 from United Casualty and Surety Insurance Company (United).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Schwartzes recorded the bond in the Worcester County registry of deeds and served a copy of the bond on the plaintiff. Approximately two weeks later, the plaintiff filed a complaint to enforce the bond against United in the District Court, and moved to strike the bond as insufficient or increase the penal sum of the bond to include National Lumber\u2019s service charges and attorney\u2019s fees and for an assessment of damages. The District Court consolidated these cases, denied the plaintiff\u2019s motions, and concluded that G. L. c. 254 limits a mechanic\u2019s lien to the amount claimed pursuant to \u00a7 8. Judgment entered against the Schwartzes and the District Court declared that the plaintiff was entitled to enforce the dissolve hen bond held by United. National Lumber appealed to the Appellate Division of the District Court, which reversed, holding that the hen included \u201creasonable contracted-for interest and related expenses\u201d including attorney\u2019s fees. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>granted the defendants\u2019 application for direct appellate review.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>A mechanic\u2019s lien is a statutory creation, <em>East Coast Steel Erectors, Inc. </em>v. <em>Ciolfi, </em>417 Mass. 602, 605 (1994); <em>Pratt &amp; Forrest Co. </em>v. <em>Strand Realty Co., </em>233 Mass. 314, 318 (1919), and can be enforced only by strict compliance with the statute. <em>Savoie Quarry &amp; Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>Ziman, </em>234 Mass. 210, 214 (1919). General Laws c. 254 governs the creation, perfection, and dissolution of a mechanic\u2019s lien and \u201cis strictly construed against the party claiming the lien.\u201d <em>Ng Bros. Constr. </em>v. <em>Cranney, </em>436 Mass. 638, 644 (2002). We have discussed the statutory process in prior opinions. See <em>Tremont Tower Condominium, LLC </em>v. <em>George B.H. Macomber Co., </em>436 Mass. 677 (2002); <em>Ng Bros. Constr. </em>v. <em>Cranney, </em>supra; <em>National Lumber I, </em>supra; <em>Hammill-McCormick Assocs., Inc. </em>v. <em>New England Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., </em>399 Mass. 541 (1987). Here, our inquiry is limited to whether a mechanic\u2019s lien recorded pursuant to G. L. c. 254, \u00a7 4, includes contractual interest and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees in addition to the amount claimed for labor and materials. We conclude that it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">\u201cThe primary purpose of the lien is to provide security to contractors, subcontractors, laborers, and suppliers for the value of their services and goods provided for improving the owner\u2019s real estate. ... At the same time, the statute contains filing and notice requirements to protect the owner and others with an interest in the property.\u201d <em>Hammill-McCormick Assocs., Inc. </em>v. <em>New England Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., supra </em>at 542-543. See <em>Bloom-South Flooring Corp. </em>v. <em>Boys\u2019 &amp; Girls\u2019 Club of Taunton Inc., ante </em>618 (2003). The statute creates a self-enforcing system to promote the lien\u2019s purposes. G. L. c. 254, \u00a7 4 (on filing and giving notice, subcontractor creates lien to secure \u201cpayment of all labor and material\u201d furnished), \u00a7 8 (on filing sworn statement of \u201camount due,\u201d lien perfected), and \u00a7 14 (lien dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>solved when bond \u201cin a penal sum equal to the amount of the lien\u201d recorded).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-4\">Statutory language is the primary source of legislative intent. <em>Hoffman </em>v. <em>Howmedica, Inc., </em>373 Mass. 32, 37 (1977). Where the language is plain and unambiguous, it is conclusive of the Legislature\u2019s purpose. <em>Pyle </em>v. <em>School Comm. of S. Hadley, </em>423 Mass. 283, 285 (1996), and cases cited. We do not \u201cread into the statute a provision which the Legislature did not see fit to put there, whether the omission came from inadvertence or of set purpose.\u201d <em>General Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Envtl. Protection, </em>429 Mass. 798, 803 (1999), quoting <em>King </em>v. <em>Viscoloid Co., </em>219 Mass. 420, 425 (1914).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">The plain wording of G. L. c. 254 limits a mechanic\u2019s lien created pursuant to \u00a7 4 to the amount due for labor and materials. Section 4 authorizes a subcontractor to create a lien for \u201call labor and material.\u201d Section 8 requires the subcontractor to file a statement of the claim for \u201cthe amount due him\u201d within thirty days of the \u00a7 4 notice. The subcontractor creates a valid lien even if he negligently misstates \u201cthe amount due for labor or material.\u201d G. L. c. 254, \u00a7 11. Finally, the property owner may dissolve the lien by obtaining a surety bond \u201cin a penal sum equal to the amount of the lien sought to be dissolved conditioned for the payment of any sum which the claimant may recover on his claim <em>for labor or labor and </em>materials\u201d (emphasis added). G. L. c. 254, \u00a7 14. Nowhere in this detailed statutory framework is there a reference to interest or attorney\u2019s fees. Contractual interest and attorney\u2019s fees are not \u201clabor and material,\u201d nor can they be part of the \u201camount due\u201d at the time the statement of claim is filed because they have not yet been determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">Despite the language in these provisions, National Lumber asks us to interpret the statute to authorize contractual interest and attorney\u2019s fees as part of the lien. It cites language in \u00a7 17 (\u201crebate of interest\u201d), \u00a7 21 (\u201cwith interest\u201d), and \u00a7 22 (\u201cCosts shall be in the discretion of the court. . .\u201d) as indicating the Legislature\u2019s intent that the statute be construed broadly to promote a meaningful collection mechanism for subcontractors. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>However, these provisions do not concern the enforcement of a lien created pursuant to \u00a7 4. See G. L. c. 254, \u00a7 17 (immature claims), \u00a7 21 (distribution following court-ordered sale), \u00a7 22 (costs following court-ordered sale). Where language in certain provisions is noticeably absent from other provisions of the same statute, such as here, we have consistently held that \u201cthe language should not be implied where it is not present.\u201d <em>Hallett </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>431 Mass. 66, 69 (2000), quoting <em>First Nat\u2019l Bank </em>v. <em>Judge Baker Guidance Ctr., </em>13 Mass. App. Ct. 144, 153 (1982). 2A N. Singer, Sutherland Statutory Construction \u00a7 46:06, at 194 (6th ed. 2000) (\u201cwhere the legislature has carefully employed a term in one place and excluded it in another, it should not be implied where excluded\u201d).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">Any doubt that the statutory language is limited to labor and materials is resolved by a consideration of other factors. Reading the statute to allow for the recovery of interest and attorney\u2019s fees as a component of the lien would contradict the Legislature\u2019s unambiguous intent that an interested person may dissolve the lien by obtaining a surety bond in the amount due for labor and materials and recording it. G. L. c. 254, \u00a7 14. Allowing a lien holder to record a claim for one amount, pursuant to \u00a7 8, and, as here, later to assert a higher amount because of terms in the contract, would subvert the statute\u2019s purpose to protect those with an interest in the property. See <em>HammillMcCormick Assocs., Inc. </em>v. <em>New England Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., supra </em>at 543, and cases cited; <em>Valentine Lumber &amp; Supply Co. </em>v. <em>Thibeault, </em>336 Mass. 411, 413 (1957). Further, the design of G. L. c. 254 ensures that a person searching the records in a registry of deeds can determine with certainty the amount due. G. L. c. 254, \u00a7 8 (recorded, sworn statement of claim must state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>\u201ca just and trac account of the amount due him\u201d). See <em>National Lumber I, supra </em>at 668.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">The plaintiff perfected a lien in an amount due for materials, as stated in its sworn statement of claim, of $26,103.98. Its recovery from the Schwartzes is limited by statute to this amount. The Schwartzes\u2019 liability derives solely from statute and these statutes present explicit means and amounts for recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">The District Court was correct in holding that the lien was dissolved when the Schwartzes recorded United\u2019s surety bond. According to G. L. c. 254, \u00a7 14, a \u201cperson in interest\u201d may dissolve a mechanic\u2019s lien by recording a surety bond \u201cin a penal sum equal to the amount of the lien sought to be dissolved conditioned for the payment of any sum which the claimant may recover on his claim for labor or labor and materials. Upon the recording of the bond, the lien shall be dissolved.\u201d Just as strict compliance with the provisions is required to perfect the lien, <em>National Lumber I, supra </em>at 666, so may a person in interest dissolve the lien by strictly adhering to the statute. Here, the lien was dissolved because the defendants complied with \u00a7 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">Finally, National Lumber claims that it is entitled to statutory interest pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7\u00a7 6C and 6H.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Neither of these provisions is applicable in the instant case because the nature of the plaintiff\u2019s action is in rem, to enforce a lien. <em>Howard </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>5 Cush. 119, 121 (1849). The plaintiff\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>action is neither \u201cbased on contractual obligations\u201d nor one \u201cin which damages are awarded.\u201d G. L. c. 231, \u00a7\u00a7 6C, 6H.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">\n<em>Judgment of the District Court affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b744-9\">We acknowledge the amicus brief filed jointly by the Northeastern Retail Lumber Association and the Massachusetts Retail Lumber Dealers Association.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b744-10\">GeneraI Laws c. 254 was substantially revised by St. 1996, c. 364.
