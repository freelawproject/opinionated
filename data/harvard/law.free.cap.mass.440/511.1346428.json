R. Prof. C. 1.7, 426 Mass. 1330 (1998),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> governing conflicts of interest does not mandate the disqualification of counsel for the plaintiffs, where the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel of record, Mark A. Berthiaume, became a member of the law firm Seyfarth Shaw (Seyfarth), which at the time acted as counsel for Equity in other matters. Pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 118, Equity petitioned a single justice of the Appeals Court for interlocutory review of the judge\u2019s order, who reported the matter to a full panel.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We transferred the cases to this court on our own motion. We now dismiss the petition as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>The facts, which are not disputed, giving rise to Equity\u2019s motion to disqualify Seyfarth are as follows. In September, 1999, the plaintiffs, former partners of Charles River Park \u201cD\u201d Company (Charles River), filed an action in the Superior Court against Equity, followed by a second action in March, 2000. The two actions, later consolidated, apparently alleged breaches of contracts and breaches of the covenants of good faith and fair dealing arising from the transfer of certain interests in Charles River to a limited partnership.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In January, 2000, Berthiaume, at the time a partner in the law firm of Schnader Harrison Goldstein &amp; Manello (Schnader Goldstein), entered his appearance on behalf of the plaintiffs in both actions. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>On July 10, 2001, a judge in the Superior Court allowed the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment and denied Equity\u2019s cross motion for summary judgment in the first action. A final judgment amended in the first action entered on September 3, 2002, and in the second action on September 23, 2002. Both Equity and the plaintiffs appealed from the final judgments: Equity appealed from the allowance of summary judgment for the plaintiffs, while the plaintiffs, still represented by Berthiaume, appealed from so much of the order as concerned prejudgment interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">Shortly after the notices of appeal were filed in the Superior Court, Berthiaume\u2019s law firm, Schnader Goldstein, dissolved. On January 1, 2003, Berthiaume became a member of Seyfarth, working in its Boston office. Before Berthiaume joined the firm, Seyfarth conducted an internal \u201cdue diligence\u201d review to identify any possible conflicts of interest between Seyfarth\u2019s existing clients and clients of Berthiaume whom he would continue to represent if (and when) he became a member of Seyfarth. The conflict check revealed that Equity was a current client of Seyfarth with matters unrelated to the Massachusetts contract action pending in offices other than Boston. Sometime before January, 2003, the firm informed Berthiaume of that fact, but also informed him, incorrectly as it turned out, that Equity had consented to Berthiaume\u2019s continued representation of the plaintiffs in the Massachusetts action. Equity, in fact, neither had been informed of, nor had consented to, Berthiaume\u2019s or Seyfarth\u2019s continued representation of the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">When Equity discovered for itself that Berthiaume, now a Seyfarth partner, represented the plaintiffs, by letter dated January 24, 2003, it demanded that Seyfarth withdraw its representation of the plaintiffs. On February 5, 2003, presumably in response to that letter, Seyfarth filed in the Superior Court an \u201cemergency motion for instructions\u201d regarding the \u201ccompeting demands\u201d of its clients Equity and Charles River. On February 12, 2003, Equity filed a cross motion to disqualify both Berthiaume and Seyfarth from continuing to represent Charles River. The motions were considered by the same judge who had earlier <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>entered summary judgment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On February 27, 2003, after \u201cbalancing\u201d the interests of Seyfarth\u2019s two clients and counsel\u2019s duty of loyalty to each, the judge denied Equity\u2019s disqualification motion.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The judge noted that his ruling also provided \u201cinstructions\u201d to the parties, as requested by Seyfarth.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>We consider first whether the issue of Berthiaume\u2019s disqualification is now moot. After the Superior Court judge issued his decision concerning disqualification, and after Equity had filed its initial brief here, Equity terminated its entire relationship with Seyfarth, a circumstance noted briefly in Equity\u2019s reply brief.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Equity argues that the issue of disqualification is not moot because to rule otherwise would provide a client in these circumstances with a \u201cHobson\u2019s choice\u201d: to enforce a lawyer\u2019s duty of loyalty as expressed in rule 1.7, the client would be required to continue to retain the lawyer whom it believed had violated that very duty. We conclude otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">Rule 1.7, by its terms, prohibits a lawyer from representing \u201ca client\u201d whose interests are directly adverse to those of \u201canother client,\u201d unless the lawyer \u201creasonably believes the representation will not adversely affect the relationship with the other client\u201d and \u201ceach client consents after consultation.\u201d Several courts have concluded that if, as here, the lawyer no longer represents a client because the client has, in essence, fired the lawyer, disqualification of the lawyer from continuing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>to serve another existing client serves no purpose, even assuming that a violation of rule 1.7 may have existed at some point in time. See, e.g., <em>Hartford Acc. &amp; Indem. Co. </em>v. <em>RJR Nabisco, Inc., 121 </em>F. Supp. 534, 540-542 (S.D.N.Y. 1989) (disqualification not warranted where client left firm after complaint was filed because \u201cthe relationships between the firms and clients\u201d were \u201cnot continuing\u201d); <em>Wong </em>v. <em>Fong, </em>60 Haw. 601, 605-606 (1979) (where attorney-client relationship terminated when separate litigation resolved, and where no record that confidential or prejudicial information obtained during litigation, disqualification \u201cwould be an empty ritual, for the evils which that remedy was intended to cure would have been dissipated\u201d). See also <em>In re Dayco Corp. Derivative Sec. Litig., </em>102 F.R.D. 624, 627, 632 (S.D. Ohio 1984) (no disqualification required where firm voluntarily withdrew from representing client in unrelated action after motion to disqualify was filed and no confidential information exchanged); Crystal, Disqualification of Counsel for Unrelated Matter Conflicts of Interest, 4 Geo. J. Legal Ethics 273, 310 (1990) (judges should deny motions for disqualification where there is no longer conflict of interest because disqualification is \u201cneedlessly expensive way\u201d to respond to wrongful conduct; firm can be \u201cpunished for any misconduct by damage award or disciplinary action\u201d). But see <em>Unified Sewerage Agency of Wash. County </em>v. <em>Jelco, Inc., </em>646 F.2d 1339, 1345 n.4 (9th Cir. 1981) (present-client standard continues to apply even though representation ceases prior to filing of motion to disqualify to preclude attorneys from converting \u201cpresent\u201d client into \u201cformer\u201d client by choosing when to cease to represent disfavored client).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">It is important that, in this case, Equity has made no claim that any duty of confidentiality has been violated by Seyfarth, or that it is actually harmed by Berthiaume\u2019s continued representation of the plaintiffs. See <em>Tipton </em>v. <em>Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, </em>872 F.2d 1491, 1498-1499 (11th Cir. 1989) (disqualification not warranted where law firm representing defendant in one action and representing plaintiff in unrelated property matter withdrew from latter action and where no indication that confidential information had been obtained); <em>Hartford Acc. &amp; Indem. Co. </em>v. <em>RJR Nabisco, Inc., supra </em>at 540-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>541 (disqualification not warranted where no indication firm obtained confidential information from former client and no claim of actual prejudice if firm continued to represent remaining client). It is also important to note that it was Equity\u2019s unilateral decision to terminate its relationship with Seyfarth, not Seyfarth\u2019s decision to cease representing Equity. See <em>id. </em>at 541 (\u201cCourt is not faced with a client abandoned by its counsel, or by counsel who will represent their clients with anything less than full vigor\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">There have been occasions where we have answered a question in a case that is moot because the issue is \u201cone of public importance, where it was fully argued on both sides, where the question was certain, or at least very likely to arise again in similar factual circumstances,\u201d especially where appellate review \u201ccould not be obtained before the recurring question would again be moot.\u201d <em>Lockhart </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>390 Mass. 780, 783 (1984). But motions to disqualify by their nature are intensely fact specific. See <em>Hartford Acc. &amp; Indem. Co. </em>v. <em>RJR Nabisco, Inc., supra </em>at 541 n.7. Whatever decision we might reach concerning the judge\u2019s decision is unlikely to offer guidance in the future.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We express no opinion on the judge\u2019s ruling, which touches on an unsettled and vigorously debated area of professional ethics. See, e.g., American Bar Association Committee on Ethics and Professional Responsibility, Formal Op. 95-390 (1995) (with three members dissenting). See also Green, Conflicts of Interest in Litigation: The Judicial Role, 65 Fordham L. Rev. 71, 74-76 (1996) (discussing spectrum of judicial responses to violations of conflicts of interest standards and disqualification motions).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">We also express no opinion as to the propriety of Berthiaume\u2019s continuing to represent the plaintiffs when he became a partner at Seyfarth, or of Seyfarth\u2019s permitting him to do so. See <em>Wong </em>v. <em>Fong, supra </em>at 607 n.7. We recognize that, \u201c[i]n this day of frequent firm reorganizations and lateral transfers, [a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>wooden application of the conflict of interest canons] would merely invite an increased number of disqualification motions, bom of little more than hardball litigation strategy sessions and advanced where there is no threat of actual prejudice.\u201d <em>Hartford Acc. &amp; Indem. Co. </em>v. <em>RJR Nabisco, Inc., supra </em>at 541. In cases of lateral transfers or law firm mergers every effort should be made, however, to ensure that clients are apprised of any potential conflicts to avoid the circumstances that occurred here. We continue to be of the view that, \u201c[p]utting it as mildly as we can, we think it would be questionable conduct for an attorney to participate in any lawsuit against his own client without the knowledge and consent of all concerned.\u201d <em>McCourt Co. </em>v. <em>FPC Props., Inc., </em>386 Mass. 145, 149 (1982), quoting <em>Cinema 5, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Cinerama, Inc., </em>528 F.2d 1384, 1386 (2d Cir. 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">The petition for interlocutory review is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b532-6\">Rule 1.7 of the Massachusetts Rules of Professional Conduct, 426 Mass. 1330 (1998), states:</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">\u201c(a) A lawyer shall not represent a client if the representation of that client will be directly adverse to another client, unless: (1) the lawyer reasonably believes the representation will not adversely affect the relationship with the other client; and (2) each client consents after consultation.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">\u201c(b) A lawyer shall not represent a client if the representation of that client may be materially limited by the lawyer\u2019s responsibilities to another client or to a third person, or by the lawyer\u2019s own interests, unless: (1) the lawyer reasonably believes the representation will not be adversely affected; and (2) the client consents after consultation.

See Mass. R. A. P. 9 (d), as appearing in 378 Mass. 935 (1979). Thus, no appeal from the amended judgment in the Superior Court has been entered on the docket of the Appeals Court. Mass. R. A. P. 10 (a) (1). The Superior Court judge thus correctly concluded that he had jurisdiction to rule on the motions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b534-7\">Equity sought to have both Seyfarth and Berthiaume disqualified; the judge\u2019s ruling applied specifically to Berthiaume.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b534-8\">No affidavit or motion to expand the record on appeal has been filed by Equity. At oral argument, counsel for Equity confirmed that Equity is no longer represented by Seyfarth in any matters, and that all attorney-client relationships between Equity and Seyfarth have been terminated, a fact not challenged by either Seyfarth or the plaintiffs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b536-7\">For example, in this case Berthiaume did not join Seyfarth until after final judgment had entered in the Superior Court and notices of appeal had been filed, and he did so only after having been erroneously informed that Equity had consented to his continued representation of Charles River. We think it unlikely that a motion to disqualify will arise in these same circumstances in the future.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b537-7\">Cowin, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AQl\">(concurring, with whom Spina, J., joins). I agree with the court that the issue of Attorney Mark A. Berthiaume\u2019s disqualification is moot because there is no longer a dual representation that may disqualify him. Even if a conflict of interest resulting in a violation of Mass. R. Prof. C. 1.7, 426 Mass. 1330 (1998), may have existed at one time, it arose only after Equity Residential Properties Trust appealed from the Superior Court judge\u2019s grant of summary judgment and ended when Equity terminated its relationship with the law firm of Seyfarth Shaw, just after the initiation of this interlocutory review and prior to the underlying appeal. On this record, a ruling on whether Berthiaume\u2019s past dual representation required disqualification serves no purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-8\">I write separately because the court proceeds to discuss Berthiaume and Seyfarth\u2019s actions, intimating that were it not for the fortuitous events that rendered this issue moot, we would have reviewed the facts of the case and determined whether dual representation was justified in this instance. Important factors would have included whether any duty of confidentiality <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>had been violated, whether Equity had been apprised of potential conflicts, and whether the motion to disqualify was a response to actual or threatened prejudice to Equity or merely a litigation strategy. This is troubling because it implies that there are circumstances in which this kind of dual representation is permissible, and suggests that this court currently possesses the comprehensive understanding of the issue that is necessary to make such a ruling. I view these implicit conclusions as inappropriate and premature.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">Against a backdrop of increasing law firm reorganizations and mergers, lateral transfers, and the rise of large-scale firms that transcend State and national borders, the issue of dual representation is one of multifaceted overtones and novel complexity. The proper interpretation of rule 1.7 in this shifting landscape requires not a decisional law approach, but systematic consideration. At this time, we cannot assume that Berthiaume and Seyfarth\u2019s actions were permissible, nor should we categorically rule out a per se disqualification in such circumstances. Instead, we should engage in a coherent study of the problems of dual representation in the organization of contemporary firms and the interplay between rule 1.7 and motions to disqualify, seeking input from the bar and, in particular, from those firms that such a study is most likely to affect. The proper outcome of such a study should be an addition or amendment to the Massachusetts Rules of Professional Conduct. To the extent that the court suggests that these issues should be dealt with on a case-by-case basis, I do not join in the opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
