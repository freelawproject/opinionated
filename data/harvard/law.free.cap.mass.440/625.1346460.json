The department calculated the amount of double billing at $675,052 and ordered Fitchburg to refund that amount to its ratepayers, with interest, over a similar period. Fitchburg appealed pursuant to G. L. c. 25, \u00a7 5. A single justice of this court reserved and reported the matter, without decision, to the full court. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>1. <em>Background. </em>We begin with a general overview of the relevant statutory and regulatory background. The department is authorized by the Legislature to enforce legislation and to promulgate rules and regulations governing the provision of telecommunications and energy services within the Commonwealth. Among its other duties, the department regulates the rates a gas company may charge to its retail customers, or \u201cratepayers.\u201d See G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 IE (authority to establish rules and regulations for gas company base rates); G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 58 (procedures for gas and electricity price regulation); G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 76 (general supervision of gas companies).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">Two kinds of regulated gas company charges are at issue in this appeal: the base rate and the CGAC, both of which are components of the total amount ratepayers pay for gas services in Massachusetts. See 220 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 6.06 (1993). The base rate is the principal device through which a gas company operating within the Commonwealth generates revenue from its ratepayers. See <em>Boston Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Telecom. &amp; Energy, </em>436 Mass. 233, 234 (2002). During the relevant period, a gas company\u2019s base rate was determined on a \u201ccost of service/rate of return\u201d basis, calculated to permit utilities to recover reasonable operating expenses and to earn a fair return on investment. See <em>Boston Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Telecom. &amp; Energy, </em>436 Mass. 233, 234 (2002). Base rates are established in departmental proceedings conducted in accordance with G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 94,'' which, among other things, requires the department to hold a public hearing on, and to investigate the propriety of, any requested base rate changes, and to inform the Attorney General of the proposed changes. G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 94.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Base rates are then set prospectively, based on historical data, i.e., a \u201ctest year,\u201d from which the gas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>company projects its future costs based on various estimates. See <em>Boston Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Telecom. &amp; Energy, supra </em>at 234-235; <em>Boston Edison Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>375 Mass. 1, 6, 7 (1978). Once established by the department, a base rate does not fluctuate with a gas company\u2019s actual costs, but only changes when the company files for, and pursuant to the procedures set out in G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 94, the department approves, a base rate change. See <em>Boston Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Telecom. &amp; Energy, supra </em>at 234, 235.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">In contrast, the CGAC is a price component established by departmental regulations that permits a utility, on a semi-annual basis, to recoup the actual costs of gas by passing those costs on to the ratepayers. See 220 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 6.06; G. L. c. 164, \u00a7\u00a7 76, 76C. The department computes the CGAC according to a complex mathematical formula that factors both projected gas costs for a certain period and a \u201creconciliation adjustment\u201d of the difference between the actual costs incurred during the relevant period and the forecast. See 220 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 6.06-6.08 (1993). Unlike the base rate, which is not subject to retroactive adjustment and may only be changed pursuant to the hearing procedures set out in G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 94, the CGAC \u201cmay, for good cause shown, be modified by the [djepartment\u201d in such manner as it \u201cmay determine to be in the public interest.\u201d 220 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 6.02, 6.12(1) (1993). See <em>Consumers Org. for Fair Energy Equality, Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>368 Mass. 599, 601-602 (1975) (describing history and function of fuel adjustment clauses).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">Inventory finance charges are charges that a company may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>incur when it borrows money to purchase gas inventory.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> From 1979<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> until 1987, the department permitted gas companies to include the cost of IFCs in either their base rate or their individually developed CGAC, so long as these costs were not included in both charges. See, e.g., Haverhill Gas Co., D.P.U. 246, at 2, 4 (1980); Bay State Gas Co., D.P.U. 962, at 1-2 (1982). In 1987, the department adopted a uniform CGAC formula that included IFCs.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Wyman-Gordon Co., D.P.U. 1669-C (1987). 220 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 6.06. Including IFCs in the CGAC rather than in the base rate allows a gas company to pass fluctuations in its interest rate costs on to consumers in a speedier, less expensive, and more market-sensitive manner than if the company were required to adjust its IFCs through the costly base rate proceedings set out in G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 94. For this reason, gas companies generally favor including IFCs in their CGAC. See, e.g., Bay State Gas Co., D.P.U. 962, <em>supra </em>at 8-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">We summarize the facts as found by the department and in the undisputed record on appeal. In 1984, Fitchburg applied for an increase in its base rate, using 1983 as its \u201ctest year\u201d from which to project its future costs. Fitchburg\u2019s 1983 base-rate costs included IFCs, and it sought to include IFCs in the prospective new base rate. Before the department could approve <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>the requested base rate increase, and for reasons unrelated to the present litigation, Fitchburg and the Attorney General negotiated a settlement that reduced Fitchburg\u2019s requested base rate increase from $1,450,983 to $816,218. The settlement, which was subsequently approved by the department, did not include any description or specific breakdown of the cost components in the base rate, and did not contain any discussion of IFCs.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">Fitchburg did not include IFCs in its CGAC in 1983, 1984, 1985, or 1986. In 1987, when the department first included IFCs in a standardized CGAC formula promulgated by regulation, Fitchburg began to include IFCs in its CGAC. Between 1987 and 1998, Fitchburg regularly submitted CGAC on a semiannual basis to the department. See 220 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 6.06. The department, pursuant to its standard policy, gave Fitchburg\u2019s CGAC applications \u201ctentative\u201d approval, while expressly reserving the right to review and require changes to the CGAC application, including modifications that \u201crequire the [c]ompany to refund to its customers any amounts that are found by the [department to be the result of imprudent [c]ompany action.\u201d However, in that period, the department never required Fitchburg to adjust the amount of the IFCs in its CGAC, and costs were passed on to ratepayers.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">Fitchburg did not seek to raise its base rate again for fourteen years, until 1998. See Fitchburg Gas &amp; Elec. Light Co., D.T.E. 98-51, at 1 (1998). During the 1998 base rate increase proceedings, Fitchburg included IFCs in its 1997 \u201ctest year,\u201d thereby alerting the department that Fitchburg might be collecting IFCs in its base rate in addition to its CGAC. On November 1, 1999, the department, on its own initiative, commenced an investigation to determine \u201c(1) whether any over-collecting of a return on gas inventory by Fitchburg has occurred; (2) the amount of any over-collection; and (3) whether Fitchburg\u2019s ratepayers are entitled to reimbursement resulting from an over-collection.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">Between March 14, 2000, and February 15, 2001, the department held hearings at which both Fitchburg and the Attorney General, as an intervener, presented documentary and testimonial evidence. See G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 11E. On May 31, 2001, the department issued its investigative order. It found that from May 1, 1987, to November 30, 1998 (a period of 139 months), Fitch-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>burg improperly overcharged its ratepayers by including IFCs in both its base rate and its CGAC. The department determined that the overcharges amounted to $675,052, and ordered Fitch-burg to repay that amount to its ratepayers, with interest. See 220 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 6.08(2) (1993). To \u201cstrike[] an appropriate balance between the need to make ratepayers whole for the overcharges and the need to maintain the financial integrity of the [c]ompany,\u201d the department permitted Fitchburg to amortize its payment to customers for a period not to exceed 139 months.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">Fitchburg filed a timely notice of appeal from the department\u2019s final order, pursuant to G. L. c. 25, \u00a7 5. On January 22, 2003, the single justice reserved and reported the case to the full court.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">2. <em>Standard of review. </em>The standard of review for petitions under G. L. c. 25, \u00a7 5, is well settled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-7\">\u201c[A] petition that raises no constitutional questions requires us to review the department\u2019s finding to determine only whether there is an error of law. . . . The burden of proof is on the appealing party to show that the order appealed from is invalid, and we have observed that this burden is heavy. . . . Moreover, we give deference to the department\u2019s expertise and experience in areas where the Legislature has delegated to it decision-making authority, pursuant to G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14. We shall uphold an agency\u2019s decision unless it is based on an error of law, unsupported by substantial evidence, unwarranted by facts found on the record as submitted, arbitrary and capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law. G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (7).\u201d (Citations omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b651-8\"><em>Massachusetts Inst. of Tech. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>425 Mass. 856, 867-868 (1997). On appeal, Fitchburg challenges the substantiality of the department\u2019s factual findings, the correct<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>ness of its conclusions that any overcharges were illegal, the department\u2019s authority to order a refund of the overcharges, and certain evidentiary rulings. We turn to the merits.-</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">3. <em>Substantial evidence. </em>Fitchburg claims that, in the absence of evidence that a specific amount in its 1984 base rate was attributable to IFCs, the department lacked substantial evidence that the company double charged consumers. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">For purposes of administrative proceedings, substantial evidence is \u201csuch evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 1 (6). In considering the substantiality of evidence in an administrative proceeding, we accord due weight to the \u201c \u2018experience, technical competence, and specialized knowledge\u2019 of the department,\u201d <em>Martorano </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>401 Mass. 257, 261 (1987), quoting G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (7), and reverse only if \u201cthe cumulative weight of the evidence tends substantially toward opposite inferences.\u201d <em>Cobble </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dep\u2019t of Social Servs., </em>430 Mass. 385, 391 (1999). \u201cThe appealing party carries the burden of showing that the order appealed from is unsupported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Boston Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Telecom. &amp; Energy, </em>436 Mass. 233, 237 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">Here, notwithstanding that neither Fitchburg, the Attorney General, nor the department could adduce a specific amount attributable to IFCs from Fitchburg\u2019s 1984 base rate, the evidence was strong that IFCs were included in that base rate. The evidence showed conclusively that the company was recovering IFCs through its base rate prior to 1984, including in its 1983 \u201ctest year,\u201d as a component of the materials and supplies costs in its base rate; that Fitchburg proposed to include IFCs in the 1984 base rate increase; and that the 1984 settlement did not exclude the collection of IFCs from Fitchburg\u2019s base rate in 1984. Fitchburg\u2019s pre-1984 collection of IFCs was consistent with well-established industry practice in the 1980\u2019s, as allowed by the department. See <em>Consumers Org. for Fair Energy Equality, Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>368 Mass. 599, 604-605 (1975) (fact finder may consider department\u2019s \u201clong administrative understanding and practice\u201d). Fitchburg\u2019s own witness testified to the reasonableness of the inference that the company <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>included IFCs in its 1984 base rate.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Moreover, as the department noted in its findings, the fact that Fitchburg included IFCs in its prospective 1998 base rate application, based on a 1997 \u201ctest year\u201d including such charges, is effectively \u201can admission by [Fitchburg] in its filing, albeit now inconvenient to or against the interest of its present claim, to the effect that [Fitchburg] considered IFCs to be part of its established rates dating from [the 1984 rate].\u201d From this and other evidence, the department could reasonably infer that Fitchburg included IFCs in its 1984 base rate, and continued to collect IFCs in its base rate until it sought a base rate adjustment in 1998. See, e.g., <em>Cobble </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dep\u2019t of Social Servs., supra </em>at 390 (agency may draw fair inferences from evidence). That the exact amount of IFCs collected through the base rate is unknown does not detract from the substantial weight of the evidence demonstrating that such charges were included in the base rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-4\">It is undisputed that, in addition to whatever IFCs Fitchburg recovered through its base rate, it collected $657,052 for the IFCs in its CGAC from 1984 through 1998. We agree with the department that it is reasonable to conclude that $657,052 represented the amount by which Fitchburg overcharged its ratepayers because, having fully exercised its option to include IFCs in the base rate, any concurrent IFCs that Fitchburg included in the CGAC were by definition excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">4. <em>Conclusions of law. </em>Fitchburg maintains that, even if it could be shown that it double counted its IFCs, or regardless whether it could be shown to have double counted them, such overcharges were not illegal as a matter of law. The company argues, in fact, that the department knew of and permitted the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>overcollection as a matter of policy. The company maintains that, by deleting from its final CGAC standardization regulations the requirement that gas companies that wish to include IFCs in their CGAC submit to base rate proceedings, the department made a policy decision that speedy implementation of the new CGAC mechanism was more important than ensuring accuracy of charges to consumers. Compare Wyman-Gordon Co., D.P.U. 1669-A, Attachment (1986),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> with 220 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 6.01-6.13 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">The fundamental flaw in this argument is the presumption that the department acted directly counter to the Legislature\u2019s intent to protect ratepayers from overreaching by public utilities. See G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 76 (department exercises \u201cgeneral supervision\u201d over utilities to ensure that they conduct business \u201cwith reference to the safety and convenience of the public\u201d). Fitch-burg requires us to presume that the department, in the interests of expediency, shirked its primary mission, to prevent overpricing by companies whose product is vital to the conduct of everyday life. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>397 Mass. 361, 369 (1986) (\u201cWe note that the [department\u2019s] role in guarding the ratepayers\u2019 interests and assuring that utility companies are not encouraged to avoid their responsibilities is supported by long-standing decisions in which we have found the legislative purpose to be protection of ratepayers\u201d); <em>Weld </em>v. <em>Gas &amp; Elec. Light Comm\u2019rs, </em>197 Mass. 556, 558 (1908) (\u201cwe have adopted, in this State, legislative regulation and control as our reliance against the evil effects of monopoly\u201d). Absent much stronger evidence than Fitchburg has brought to bear in this appeal, we presume that the department\u2019s practices, policies, and procedures further rather than inhibit its objectives and responsibilities. See, e.g., <em>Massachusetts Inst. of Tech. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>425 Mass. 856, 867-868 (1997); <em>Commonwealth Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., supra </em>at 368, 369.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>Here, the department\u2019s regulations standardizing a new CGAC filing must be read against the backdrop of a number of administrative cases decided in 1979 and the 1980\u2019s requiring gas companies to adjust their base rate if costs formerly included in the base rate were recouped through the CGAC. See Investigation by the Department, D.P.U. 4240-78/19806, at 9-10 (1979).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See also Haverhill Gas Co., D.P.U. 246, at 7 (1980) (gas company to adjust its base rate to exclude IFCs); Boston Gas Co., D.P.U. 123, at 11-12 (1980) (same); Bay State Gas Co., D.P.U. 962, at 9 (1982) (same); Colonial Gas Co., D.P.U. 1126, at 6 (1982) (same) Contrary to Fitchburg\u2019s arguments, the new CGAG regulations did not abrogate the prohibition against double charging implicit in those cases. They merely increased the number of options a company has for recouping IFCs, while leaving intact the prohibition against double billing.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Even if we accept Fitchburg\u2019s argument that the base rate hearing requirement was deleted from the final regulation in order to spare consumers the pass-along expense of base rate litigation costs, we do not see how such a policy decision translates into an endorsement of overcharging.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">We reject Fitchburg\u2019s claim that the department failed properly to put the company on notice that it may not double charge its customers. A gas company must be in \u201ccompliance with the provisions of law and the orders, directions and requirements of the department,\u201d G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 76, and the depart<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>ment may establish such policies through adjudicatory proceedings. See <em>Massachusetts Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>383 Mass. 675, 679 (1981). Fitchburg knew, or should have known, of the considerable body of precedent proscribing the practice of double billing. Cf. <em>id. </em>at 679-680. These administrative rulings, no less than common sense, should have alerted Fitchburg to the impropriety of its billing practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">We also find no merit in Fitchburg\u2019s argument that its overcharges were reasonable in light of the department\u2019s repeated approval of its CGAC during the relevant period. The department\u2019s failure to detect Fitchburg\u2019s overbilling practices for a period of over eleven years, while regrettable, does not immunize the company from the consequence of having acted illegally. See <em>LaBarge </em>v. <em>Chief Admin. Justice of the Trial Court, </em>402 Mass. 462, 468 (1988) (\u201cthe doctrine of estoppel is not applied against the government in the exercise of its public duties\u201d); <em>Phipps Prods. Corp. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth., </em>387 Mass. 687, 693 (1982) (\u201cThis court has been reluctant to apply principles of estoppel to public entities where to do so would negate requirements of law intended to protect the public interest\u201d); <em>Doris </em>v. <em>Police Comm\u2019r of Boston, </em>374 Mass. 443, 449 (1978) (\u201cIt would indeed be a most serious consequence if we were to conclude that the inattention or inactivity of government officials could render a statute unenforceable and thus deprive the public of the benefits or protections bestowed by the Legislature\u201d). Similarly, we are unmoved by Fitchburg\u2019s argument that, because its base rates were not as high as they legally could have been, any overcharge of IFCs should be credited against the amount the company would have collected had it sought and obtained a base rate change earlier than 1998. That Fitchburg voluntarily refrained from seeking an increase in its base rate from 1984 to 1998 has no bearing on the question whether the charges it did collect were improper. To hold otherwise would be to permit a gas company to increase its base rates by stealth in violation of G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 94.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">In short, Fitchburg has failed to carry its heavy burden of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>proving that its overcharges were either permitted or endorsed (tacitly or explicitly) by the department.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">5. <em>Scope of authority. </em>We next consider whether, as Fitchburg claims, the department\u2019s refund order constitutes retroactive rulemaking in violation of its statutory authority. It is well established that the department may not order retroactive adjustments (either up or down) of a gas company\u2019s base rate. See <em>Boston Edison Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>375 Mass. 1, 6 (1978) (\u201ca rate increase may not be awarded retroactively as matter of law\u201d). See also <em>Lowell Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>377 Mass. 37, 44-45 (1979); <em>Fryer </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>374 Mass. 685, 689-690 (1978); <em>Newton </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>367 Mass. 667, 678 (1975); <em>Metropolitan Dist. Comm\u2019n </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>352 Mass. 18, 26-27 (1967). See generally Krieger, The Ghost of Regulation Past: Current Applications of the Rule against Retroactive Ratemaking in Public Utility Proceedings, 1991 U. 111. L. Rev. 983, 984. The rule against retroactive ratemaking finds its source in the statutory construction of G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 94, which mandates determination by the department, after a public hearing and an investigation, of the \u201cpropriety\u201d of the new base rate. See, e.g., <em>Consumers Org. for Fair Energy Equality, Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>368 Mass. 599, 605-606 (1975); <em>Cambridge Elec. Light Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>363 Mass. 474, 494-495 &amp; n.31 (1973); <em>Metropolitan Dist. Comm\u2019n </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., supra </em>at 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">We have not previously been asked to determine whether the rule against retroactive ratemaking should be applied to adjustments in the CGAC, but we have no difficulty in concluding that an order retroactively adjusting a CGAC is well within the department\u2019s general supervisory authority over utility costs, see G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 76, and is consistent with its \u201cbroad authority to determine ratemaking matters in the public interest.\u201d <em>Massachusetts Inst. of Tech. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub.

Unlike the base rate, which is a calculation of rates going forward based on historical data, the CGAC adjusts semiannually for utility costs as they actually have been incurred, according to a mechanically applied technical formula. See <em>Consumers Org. for Fair Energy Equality, Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., supra </em>at 606. The formula itself is a fixed \u201crate\u201d that cannot be changed outside the hearing procedure mandated by G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 94. See <em>id. </em>at 604. But the \u201cdollars and cents\u201d amount inserted into the flow-through formula is presumptively not fixed. <em>Id. </em>They represent costs over which utilities often have little bargaining power or control, and it would defeat the very purpose of a CGAC to require these costs to be frozen until the expensive and cumbersome process of a rate change hearing is completed. See <em>id. </em>at 606-607 (it would be \u201cincongruous\u201d to require a \u00a7 94 rate proceeding before passing cost fluctuations onto ratepayers, because \u201cthe clauses were designed precisely to avoid those proceedings except where changes were being proposed in the clauses themselves\u201d).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> See also <em>Newton </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number><em>supra </em>at 679 n.12 (distinguishing power to order rate rebate for inadequate telephone service under G. L. c. 159, with its \u201cspecific sections relating to the regulation of rates and service,\u201d from the general ratemaking powers of G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 76C, and regulations issued thereunder).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">Furthermore, CGAC are governed not by G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 94, but by regulations promulgated pursuant to the department\u2019s general supervisory powers as conferred by the Legislature in G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 76. These regulations expressly give the department authority to investigate the CGAC, see 220 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 6.12(4), and to modify the application of the CGAC. See 220 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 6.02. Fitchburg does not challenge these regulations. Here, the department is not ordering a refund of wrongly projected excessive profits, but taking corrective action in response to an error in the calculation of the CGAC. Such corrective measures are well within its authority to protect consumers. See G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 76. As we stated in another regulatory context, a regulatory body correcting \u201ca mistake in the expense allowance resulting from the improper use of data\u201d does not engage in a \u201c \u2018second look\u2019 that violatefs] the prohibition on retroactivity.\u201d <em>Automobile Insurers Bur. of Mass. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>425 Mass. 262, 267 (1997) (regulation of automobile insurance rates). See <em>Daily Advertiser </em>v. <em>Trans-La, </em>612 So. 2d 7, 25 (La. 1993) (\u201cBy implication, the commission\u2019s ongoing authority to investigate fuel cost adjustments passed on through such clauses includes the power, when necessary, to take corrective measures and to order refunds for charges not prudently incurred\u201d).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">As for the specifics of the refund order itself, we reject Fitch-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>burg\u2019s argument that the department\u2019s order constitutes a confiscation in violation of arts. 1, 10, and 12 of the Declaration of Rights of the Massachusetts Constitution and the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. See <em>Boston Edison Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>375 Mass. 1, 10-11 (1978) (\u201cConfiscation occurs when the Department\u2019s ratemaking decision deprives a utility of the opportunity to realize a fair and reasonable return on its investment\u201d). Ordering an entity to disgorge unlawful profits is not unconstitutional confiscation but rather a lawful responsibility of many administrative agencies, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>including the department. <em>Id. </em>We agree with the single justice that Fitchburg failed to show that the department erred in concluding that a refund payout period of 139 months will amply protect Fitchburg\u2019s \u201cfinancial integrity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">6. <em>Evidentiary issues. </em>Fitchburg was not, as it contends, materially prejudiced by the department\u2019s exclusion from evidence of certain notes and analyses made by a department staff member and by the department\u2019s reliance on materials not in the record. First, there was no error in excluding from evidence the notes and analyses of a staff member who had no decision-making authority within the department and whose testimony would, in any event, have been merely cumulative of the uncontroverted evidence that the department had failed to detect Fitchburg\u2019s overcharges during the relevant period. Second, we agree with Fitchburg that the department should not have included in its order a review of the practices of other gas companies, which it had not introduced in evidence. However, Fitchburg has failed to show that it was substantially prejudiced by the department\u2019s inclusion of the review.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> See G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (7); <em>Trustees of Clark Univ. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>372 Mass. 331, 335 (1977); <em>Duato </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub.

Whenever the department receives notice of any changes proposed to be made in any schedule filed under this chapter which represent a general increase in rates, prices and charges for gas or electric service, it shall notify the attorney general of the same forthwith, and shall thereafter hold a public hearing and make an investigation as to the propriety of such proposed changes after first causing notice of the time, place and the subject matter of such hearing to be published at least twenty-one days before such hearing in such local newspapers as the department may select.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b649-6\">Gas companies procure and store gas to meet future customer demand, particularly seasonal demand. Because a company is not paid until after the gas is distributed to its customers, a gas company incurs expenses for the purchase of gas inventories that are realized either through capital expenditure or short-term borrowing. See Fitchburg Gas &amp; Elec. Light Co., D.T.E. 98-51, at 16 (1998) (\u201cA company is entitled to be reimbursed for the costs associated with using its own funds or for the interest expense it incurs on funds borrowed for this purpose\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b649-7\">In 1979, the department established a standard CGAC to replace the company-specific CGAC. D.P.U. 4240-78/19806, at 2-3 (1979). Concerned lest the rules change lead to overlapping base rate and CGAC charges, the department expressly directed utility companies to be prepared in future rate cases to \u201cshow in detail how its [base] rates are being modified to comply with the standard [CGAC].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 9.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b649-8\">The current version of the applicable regulation states: \u201cTotal inventory finance charges \u2014 As billed in each peak season in anticipation of subsequent off-peak season charges.

Regs. \u00a7 6.06 (1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b651-9\">Fitchburg was given thirty days to file a revised CGAC reconciliation factor in compliance with the department\u2019s order. Fitchburg filed a motion with the department to stay enforcement of the order pending the outcome of its appeal. The motion was denied. Subsequently, Fitchburg filed a motion in the county court for a stay of the department\u2019s order. A single justice denied the motion on November 16, 2001. Fitchburg began to implement the refund in bills for services rendered on or after November 1, 2001.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b653-6\">For example, one Fitchburg witness testified that a utility could be expected to assume that an undisputed item in a proposed filing, such as the IFCs at issue here, would be included in a settlement reached with the government. She also testified that failure to include any amount for gas inventories in the 1983 base rate would have been inconsistent with the company\u2019s obligation to consumers to have enough gas on hand to meet peak winter demand.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">Given the latter testimony, the department acted well within its discretion to conclude that the testimony of a Fitchburg witness who characterized the reference to IFCs in the base rate request as a \u201cplaceholder\u201d was \u201cto put it with restraint, implausible.\u201d See <em>School Comm. of Wellesley </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, 376 </em>Mass. 112, 120 (1978) (\u201cIt is for the agency, not the courts, to weigh the credibility of witnesses and resolve factual disputes\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b654-6\">Proposed 220 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 6.03, which was not adopted, stated: \u201cThe date on which this clause is to become effective for each utility shall be determined by the [department. Implementation may be delayed pending a review of a utility\u2019s allocated cost of service study and in conjunction with any adjustments to base rates determined to be appropriate by the [\u00bfdepartment.\u201d See Wyman-Gordon Co., D.RU. 1669-A, Attachment (1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b655-6\">With regard to other costs that might be included in either the base rate or the CGAC, the department has stated explicitly that a gas company may not collect the same cost twice. Wyman-Gordon Co., D.P.U. 1669-B, at 10 (1987) (\u201cCompanies proposing to include production gas costs in [the CGAC] would be required ... to identify the amounts in excess of the level included in base rates\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b655-7\">Fitchburg had a number of available options for correctly charging for IFCs after standardization of the CGAC. It could have elected to keep the IFCs in its base rate and \u201czeroed out\u201d the amount for IFCs in the standardized CGAC. It could have sought a new base rate hearing to eliminate IFCs from the base rate prior to including them in the CGAC, or, more practically, it could have avoided the base rate proceeding procedures by requesting a voluntary reduction in its base rate. Hearings pursuant to G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 94, are not required for such voluntary reductions, and Fitchburg had used the voluntary reduction procedure on at least one prior occasion, in 1993, to permit its customers to benefit from the reduced expenses realized by a debt financing. See Fitchburg Gas &amp; Elec. Light Co., D.P.U. 93-168A, at 5 (1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b656-7\"> Although the department has a general power to investigate utilities under G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 76, it does not have the power to initiate a new base rate proceeding absent a company\u2019s request. G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 94.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b657-7\">Fitchburg also argues that it was not required to obtain approval of a financing vehicle, see 220 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 6.06, before including IFCs in its CGAC. This matter was the subject of other administrative proceedings, and we need not address it here. Only the overcharging claims are at issue on this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b658-5\">Because we conclude that the department had the authority to adjust a CGAC retroactively, we do not consider the department\u2019s argument that Fitch-burg should be estopped from claiming that the refund order constitutes retroactive ratemaking because it had previously sought a retroactive adjustment in its CGAC. See <em>Rock </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>384 Mass. 198, 200 n.4 (1981) (\u201cSince we find no error in the commission\u2019s order . . . we do not reach these [procedural] issues\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b658-6\">After these petitioners had challenged the increase to their electricity bills, but prior to this court\u2019s decision, the Legislature enacted St. 1974, c. 625, \u00a7 1, which requires that an electric company cannot charge a customer under a fuel adjustment clause without the department\u2019s approval after a public hearing. <em>Consumers Org. for Fair Energy Equality, Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>368 Mass. 599, 612 (1975). See G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 94G (governing fuel adjustment charges for electric companies).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">Because we have long held that changes to fuel adjustment clauses are not ratemaking subject to the requirements of G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 94, <em>Consumers Org. for Fair Energy Equality, Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., supra, </em>we do not agree with Fitchburg that the Legislature\u2019s failure specifically to authorize these adjustments, as it did with electric companies, see G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 94G, indicates a legislative intent to limit the department\u2019s authority to adjust the gas CGAC. See <em>Massachusetts Respiratory Hosp. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Welfare, </em>414 Mass. 330, 333 n.4 (1993) (A subsequent amendment \u201cshould be given no weight as \u2018demonstrating\u2019 that no such authority existed before its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>enactment. To conclude otherwise might discourage the Legislature from eliminating uncertainties in existing legislation for fear that courts might construe its action as an admission that theretofore an agency lacked authority to act in a questioned area\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b659-8\">Although statutes regulating gas companies do vary, it is instructive to note that other States that have examined this issue have also concluded that fuel adjustment clauses are not retroactive ratemaking. See, e.g., <em>Daily Advertiser </em>v. <em>Trans-La, </em>612 So. 2d 7, 23 (La. 1993) (noting \u201cin most jurisdictions, the commission implements such clauses pursuant to its plenary rate making authority,\u201d but because adjustments \u201cgo into effect without an antecedent reasonableness review\u201d a commission is \u201cnot precluded by the rule against retroactive rate making from subsequently examining and modifying such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>adjustments\u201d); <em>Ohio Power Co. </em>v. <em>Public Utils.

See, e.g., <em>Daily Advertiser </em>v. <em>Trans-La, supra </em>at 25 (\u201cBy implication, the commission\u2019s ongoing authority to investigate fuel cost adjustments passed on through such clauses includes the power, when necessary, to take corrective measures and to order refunds for charges not prudently incurred\u201d); <em>Matter of Niagara Mohawk Power Corp. </em>69 N.Y. 2d 365, 372-373 (1987) (\u201c[T]he power to order refunds must be implied, for there is little purpose in reviewing fuel adjustment charges, and the consumer\u2019s interests are ignored, if corrective action is not authorized for imprudent expenditures automatically passed through to the ratepayers.
