Turgeon, II. The arbitration had proceeded as part of MCAD\u2019s alternative dispute resolution (ADR) program. While the MCAD\u2019s review of the arbitrator\u2019s award was pending, Turgeon filed a complaint in the Superior Court to confirm the award pursuant to G. L. c. 251. On the city\u2019s motion, a judge in the Superior Court dismissed the case. When the MCAD affirmed the arbitrator\u2019s award,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the city filed a separate action in the Superior Court, challenging MCAD\u2019s decision. See G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 6. A second judge in the Superior Court affirmed the decision of the MCAD. Turgeon appealed from the judgment in the first action, and the city appealed from the judgment in the second action. A third Superior Court judge allowed Turgeon\u2019s motion to consolidate the cases; however, the cases continued to proceed separately. We transferred the appeals to this court on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-13\">We affirm the judgment denying Turgeon\u2019s request for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>confirmation of the arbitrator\u2019s award under G. L. c. 251, on procedural grounds. Because we conclude that Turgeon has not made a threshold showing that he is \u201chandicapped\u201d as defined in G. L. c. 15IB, \u00a7 1 (17), we reverse the judgment upholding the MCAD\u2019s affirmance of the arbitrator\u2019s award. We remand the matter to the Superior Court where judgment shall enter for the city.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">1. <em>Facts. </em>We summarize the facts as found by the arbitrator, supplemented where necessary by undisputed aspects of the record. On February 11, 1996, Turgeon, a New Bedford police officer and member of the New Bedford police department\u2019s (department\u2019s) \u201cSWAT teams,\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> shot and killed an armed suspect. Turgeon spent the ensuing twelve months on leave on \u201cinjured on duty\u201d (IOD) status. During that period there were two separate inquiries concerning the circumstances of the shooting. First, a public inquest was conducted before a judge in the District Court. Second, the professional standards division of the department conducted an internal investigation. Both investigations vindicated Turgeon of any wrongdoing, and no criminal or other charges were brought against him. In the wake of those decisions, Turgeon returned to his regular police duties in February, 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">Shortly after Turgeon\u2019s return to active duty, then-acting Chief of Police Carl Moniz removed Turgeon from both SWAT teams on which he previously had served \u2014 the special reaction team (SRT) and the tactical patrol force (TPF). Moniz\u2019s decision is the focus of Turgeon\u2019s complaint of handicap discrimination. We describe in some detail the facts culminating in that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">Immediately after the 1996 fatal shooting incident, Turgeon was placed on leave on IOD status and referred to a counsellor, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>in accordance with department policy. Approximately one month later, Turgeon obtained the necessary medical release to return to active duty. Because the public inquest and the internal investigation were still under way, the department assigned Turgeon to an administrative (desk) position. Turgeon responded by \u201ccall[ing] in sick.\u201d After negotiations with the department, Turgeon returned to IOD status. For the following eleven months, and while he was IOD, Turgeon periodically consulted a psychologist.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">In February, 1997, at the conclusion of the two investigations, an incident occurred that is of some significance. On January 25, 1997, apparently when he learned the outcome of the internal investigation absolving him of any wrongdoing, Turgeon sent an electronic mail message (e-mail) to every member of the police department. As the arbitrator found, the lengthy, accusatory message showed \u201cvery clearly\u201d Turgeon\u2019s \u201cfeelings\u201d toward the department\u2019s senior officials. Specifically, Turgeon criticized unnamed leaders of the police department for what he claimed was their failure to support him in the wake of the shooting. He informed his fellow officers that he had lost \u201crespect and admiration\u201d for his superiors, advising his colleagues that, if they were involved in a fatal shooting, they would receive no departmental support. Turgeon urged that his colleagues \u201cnot think twice\u201d in a situation similar to the one he confronted, and to protect themselves \u201chowever . . . possible.\u201d While he remained loyal to his \u201cprofession,\u201d Turgeon wrote, he did not remain loyal to \u201cthis [department.\u201d It is a fair reading of Turgeon\u2019s e-mail that he was angry and bitter about the treatment he had received while he awaited the outcome of the public and internal investigations.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">Turgeon returned to active duty on February 16, 1997, and was assigned to a one-man car patrol. On inquiry, the SRT commander, Lieutenant Kenneth Gifford, informed Turgeon that he would return as a member of the SRT team, and issued a new holster to him. This was followed by a second incident also of import to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">Gifford ordered Turgeon to undergo an SRT requalification firing examination. Turgeon reported to the firing range, but complained to the officer in charge, saying, according to the of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>fleer\u2019s testimony, that he \u201cdidn\u2019t know why he had to be there because he proved himself he could shoot.\u201d Turgeon later sought to downplay the import of this remark.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The officer, however, was left with the impression that Turgeon had made an inappropriate reference to the shooting incident in which Turgeon had killed a man.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">A few days later, members of the SRT (including its two leaders) discussed, among other things, Turgeon\u2019s return to their team. As the arbitrator found, the team regularly discussed prospective team members; their discussion of Turgeon was not out of the ordinary.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Noting both Turgeon\u2019s e-mail and the incident at the firing range, the team members were \u201cconcerned\u201d about Turgeon, and not \u201ccomfortable\u201d about his return to the SRT. One team leader expressed his concerns '.as a \u201cleader of men whose lives were on the line in going through the door in a hostage or barricade situation.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The two leaders presented these concerns to their commander, Gifford, informing him that Turgeon was \u201cacting different,\u201d seemed to be \u201cunder stress,\u201d was \u201ctaking chances,\u201d and seemed to be \u201ctrying to prove something.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">In response, Gifford undertook his own investigation, talking to officers who were friends of Turgeon, including his partner on the night of the shooting. The full content of these conversations is not contained in the record, but it is not disputed that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>Gifford learned that \u201csomething was wrong\u201d and that Turgeon was \u201cunder stress.\u201d Gifford discussed these concerns with Turgeon, who, according to Gifford, \u201chad an answer for everything,\u201d insisting that his behavior was \u201ctaken out of context\u201d or \u201cmisunderstood]. \u2019 \u2019 Gifford concluded that Turgeon should remain on the SWAT teams, but not be permitted to participate in any SRT assignments until both Gifford\u2019s and Turgeon\u2019s team members had more time to observe Turgeon in the course of his regular patrol work. The team\u2019s leaders, \u201cwith some doubts,\u201d agreed to this \u201cprobationary\u201d period.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">Gifford then met with Acting Chief Moniz to discuss the matter. After listening to Gifford, Moniz reached a different conclusion and determined that Turgeon should be removed from the SRT. On March 3, 1997, Moniz met with Turgeon to inform him of his decision. Although their respective accounts vary slightly, there is no dispute that Moniz informed Turgeon that he was being removed from the SRT because of concerns that he was not ready to perform in \u201chigh-risk\u201d situations.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Turgeon disagreed with Moniz\u2019s decision and left, \u201cslamming the door behind him.\u201d Turgeon\u2019s commanding officer later came across Turgeon crying in the locker room \u201cin humiliation and frustration,\u201d according to Turgeon, and told him to go home on sick leave. As he was leaving, Turgeon confronted Moniz in the parking lot, saying that he was making a \u201cmistake\u201d and that this was not the end of the matter. Six months later, Turgeon filed a complaint with the MCAD.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">2. <em>Procedure. </em>We discuss in some detail the proceedings in the MCAD because they inform our decision in large degree. Turgeon\u2019s MCAD complaint alleged that he had been discriminated against on the \u201cpretext\u201d that he had a \u201cperceived psychological handicap.\u201d After an initial review of the case, the MCAD recommended that the parties participate in the \u201cMCAD/AAA program on Alternative Dispute Resolution\u201d administered in accordance with MCAD\u2019s policy on alternative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>dispute resolution (Policy 96-1). The policy was adopted to provide \u201cminimum standards of quality and procedural safeguards,\u201d and to ensure \u201cjust and fair processes and outcomes\u201d for disputes resolved under the program. The MCAD undertook to retain jurisdiction over Turgeon\u2019s complaint \u201cat all times while this [ADR] process is pending.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">On October 19, 1998, eleven months after Turgeon filed his complaint, he and the city executed a submission to arbitration (submission), agreeing to submit their dispute to \u201cbinding arbitration under the MCAD Program on ADR (Policy 96-1).\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The city agreed to do so in reliance on the MCAD\u2019s representation that it would retain jurisdiction of the complaint. As described in the submission, Turgeon claimed that he was removed from the SRT and the TPF because of concerns that he was \u201cready to \u2018snap,\u2019 \u201d that he was \u201cperceived to be under stress,\u201d and that he was \u201cperceived to be handicapped.\u201d Turgeon requested that \u201chis personnel file reflect the fact that he is fit for duty,\u201d that he be awarded \u201cmonetary damages for all losses suffered to date,\u201d and that he be \u201creinstated to all [tactical teams.\u201d An arbitrator was appointed, the parties agreed to the issues to be resolved by the arbitrator,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and the MCAD suspended further \u201cprocessing\u201d of Turgeon\u2019s complaint. See Policy 96-1, \u00a7 1.1(b).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">Fourteen months later, on December 13, 1999, the arbitrator rendered a decision in favor of Turgeon, noting twice that the case had been arbitrated under the MCAD\u2019s Policy 96-1. He ordered the city to reinstate Turgeon as a member of the SRT and the TPF, awarded Turgeon back pay with interest, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>emotional distress damages, and awarded punitive damages totaling approximately $90,000. On January 12, 2000, the arbitrator issued a \u201cclarification of order\u201d; on March 16, 2000, he issued an \u201cinformational order\u201d; and on April 6, 2000, he issued a \u201cfinal order,\u201d in which he also awarded Turgeon attorney\u2019s fees in the amount of $25,388.93.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\">On December 23, 1999, ten days after the arbitrator\u2019s initial decision, the city filed an appeal with the MCAD requesting that it exercise its power under Policy 96-1 to set aside the award.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The MCAD did not act within thirty business days of the arbitrator\u2019s initial decision, dated December 13, 1999. Rather, in April and May, 2000, the MCAD informed the parties that the arbitrator\u2019s decision remained pending under its review.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Without awaiting the MCAD\u2019s decision, on June 7, 2000, Turgeon filed his complaint in the Superior Court alleging that the thirty-day period for setting aside the arbitrator\u2019s award as provided in Policy 96-1 had expired. See note 14, <em>supra. </em>As noted earlier, he had unsuccessfully sought confirmation of the award pursuant to G. L. c. 251, \u00a7 11.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">Meanwhile, on June 20, 2000, the MCAD issued its decision denying the city\u2019s request to set aside the award and declaring the arbitrator\u2019s decision \u201cfinal,\u201d and the case \u201cclosed.\u201d This gave rise to the second action in the Superior Court, filed on July 18, 2000, in which the city appealed from the decision of the MCAD, relying on G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 6, and naming both Turgeon and the MCAD as defendants.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Turgeon and the city <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>filed cross motions for judgment on the pleadings, and the MCAD filed a motion to dismiss on jurisdictional grounds. The second judge in the Superior Court denied MCAD\u2019s motion and then, in a brief memorandum, ruled in favor of Turgeon; he refused to set aside or modify the MCAD\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">3. <em>Standard of judicial review. </em>Turgeon argues that the express terms of Policy 96-1 require that MCAD\u2019s review of an arbitration award be completed within thirty business days. See note 14, <em>supra. </em>Thereafter, he continues, the arbitrator\u2019s decision is \u201cfinal,\u201d the matter is \u201cclosed,\u201d and the parties are free to seek confirmation of the award in the Superior Court pursuant to the provisions of G. L. c. 251, \u00a7 11. The city contends, and a judge in the Superior Court agreed, that G. L. c. 251 is inapplicable to an award by an arbitrator who proceeds, as here, under the MCAD ADR program, and that G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 6, provides the exclusive avenue for judicial review of such awards. We agree with the well-reasoned decision of the Superior Court judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">Policy 96-1 provides a mechanism for the resolution of discrimination claims as an alternative to the MCAD\u2019s statutory and regulatory procedural requirements. The policy reflects an admirable effort by the agency to resolve claims of discrimination in a timely and efficacious manner. By the policy\u2019s express terms, a case remains subject to the MCAD\u2019s review, so that the agency may be assured that every arbitrated decision is consistent with the important public policies the MCAD enforces.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> As explained in \u00a7 1.8(a) of the policy, the MCAD may set aside an arbitrator\u2019s decision if, among other reasons, the decision \u201cis not in the public interest\u201d because it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>\u201cpalpably wrong\u201d or \u201cclearly repugnant to the purposes and policies of the [commission.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">Thus, discrimination cases that proceed to arbitration under the MCAD\u2019s ADR program remain at all times within the MCAD\u2019s exclusive jurisdiction, subject to its review before any arbitration decision is \u201cfinal.\u201d An arbitrator\u2019s decision is, accordingly, not free standing. It reflects the MCAD\u2019s considered judgment that the decision is consonant with the purposes and policies of our antidiscrimination laws. It follows, necessarily, that the final decision is a decision of the MCAD and must be reviewed as such. See G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 6. Judicial review accorded the decisions of independent arbitrators under G. L. c. 251 is simply inapplicable in these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">As provided in G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 6, judicial review proceeds under the well-established standards mandated by G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (7): the reviewing court may set aside or modify the decision because, among other reasons, it exceeds the authority of the agency, is based on an error of law, or is arbitrary or capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law. See G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (7) <em>(b), </em>(c), and <em>(g). </em>The MCAD and the city agree that a court should review to determine only whether the MCAD complied with its own Policy 96-1, applying the standards of G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (7). Stated differently, the court should review the decision of the</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>agency (in this case MCAD\u2019s decision to affirm the arbitrator\u2019s award) rather than the initial decision of the arbitrator itself.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> We agree. Our task is to determine the validity of MCAD\u2019s own decision that the arbitrator\u2019s award was not \u201cpalpably wrong\u201d or \u201cclearly repugnant to the purposes and policies\u201d of the MCAD. See note 19, <em>supra. </em>See also <em>Howe </em>v. <em>Health Facilities Appeals Bd., </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 531, 537 (1985) (\u201cOur search has revealed no statutory scheme in which the scope of judicial review was broader than the scope of review before the administrative body whose decision was subject to review\u201d). While we do not set aside ordinary arbitration decisions on grounds of factual or legal error, see <em>Lynn </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>435 Mass. 54, 61-62 (2001), and cases cited, this particular arbitration was subject to a standard of review (whether it was \u201cpalpably wrong\u201d) under Policy 96-1, and the parties are entitled to have the agency apply that standard. When the parties agreed to arbitration under Policy 96-1, they agreed to a form of arbitration that included review under a standard of \u201cpalpably wrong,\u201d and the customary limitations on the review of arbitration decisions were thus supplanted by the standards articulated in Policy 96-1. If, as we conclude, it is evident that the arbitrator\u2019s decision was \u201cpalpably wrong,\u201d the MCAD\u2019s decision to uphold it must be set aside. In making our determination, we review the agency\u2019s decision to uphold the arbitration award pursuant to the standards set forth in G. L. c. 30A, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>\u00a7 14 (7). See <em>Lavelle </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>426 Mass. 332, 334 (1997). We reject the MCAD\u2019s attempt to cabin our review to an \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d by the agency. See note 20, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\"><em>4. The MCAD decision. </em>The arbitrator found that Turgeon presented \u201ccredible evidence\u201d that his removal from the SRT and TPF teams was based \u201cin part\u201d on the perception that he was handicapped, and that Turgeon had established a prima facie case of handicap discrimination.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark>\u2019<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> He further found that the city did not prove a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for removing Turgeon from the SWAT teams. The city argues that the decision was \u201cpalpably wrong\u201d and \u201crepugnant to [the MCAD\u2019s] purposes and policies,\u201d because Turgeon was not regarded as \u201chandicapped\u201d as that term is defined in G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 1 (17). We agree, and hold that the MCAD\u2019s affirmation of the arbitrator\u2019s decision was an error of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">Claims of handicap discrimination, including a perception of (\u201cregarded as\u201d) impairment, proceed under the well-settled three-stage order of proof. See, e.g., <em>Labonte </em>v. <em>Hutchins &amp; Wheeler, </em>424 Mass. 813, 821 (1997); G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 1 (17). To satisfy his initial burden of establishing a prima facie case of unlawful employment discrimination on the basis of handicap, <em>id., </em>Turgeon was required to present credible evidence that he was (1) \u201chandicapped\u201d; (2) \u201ccapable of performing the essential functions\u201d of the job \u201cwith reasonable accommodation\u201d; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>and (3) subject to an adverse action by his employer; and that (4) the position he had occupied remained open and the employer sought to fill it. G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4 (16). <em>Dartt </em>v. <em>Browning-Ferris Indus., Inc. (Mass.), All </em>Mass. 1, 3 (1998).<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Turgeon was therefore required to make a threshold showing that he was \u201chandicapped\u201d within the meaning of G. L. c. 151B.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>Giving complete deference to the factual findings of the arbitrator, we conclude that Turgeon has failed to meet this initial, but essential, burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">Not all physical or mental impairments constitute a \u201chandicap\u201d under the Massachusetts antidiscrimination statute. General Laws c. 151B, \u00a7 1 (17), provides that a \u201chandicap\u201d is <em>(a) </em>an actual \u201cphysical or mental impairment which substantially limits one or more major life activities\u201d; (b) a \u201crecord of having <em>such </em>impairment\u201d; or (c) \u201cbeing regarded as having <em>such </em>impairment\u201d (emphases added). Subparts <em>(b) </em>and (c), by their terms (\u201csuch impairment\u201d), incorporate all of the requirements of subpart <em>(a): </em>every plaintiff must demonstrate that an actual impairment, \u201crecord of . . . impairment,\u201d or being \u201cregarded as having [an] impairment\u201d \u201csubstantially limits one or more major life activities.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>United Parcel Serv., Inc., </em>527 U.S. 516, 521-522 (1999) (\u201ca person is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>\u2018regarded as\u2019 disabled within the meaning of the [Americans with Disabilities Act] if a covered entity mistakenly believes that the person\u2019s actual, nonlimiting impairment substantially limits one or more major life activities\u201d).<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">The first requirement, whether a plaintiff has demonstrated that he is \u201chandicapped\u201d within the meaning of G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 1 (17), is determined by a three-step analysis. See <em>Bragdon </em>v. <em>Abbott, </em>524 U.S. 624, 631 (1998); <em>Carroll </em>v. <em>Xerox Corp., </em>294 F.3d 231, 238 (1st Cir. 2002); <em>Lebron-Torres </em>v. <em>Whitehall Labs., </em>251 F.3d 236, 239-240 (1st Cir. 2001).<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> First, we consider whether a plaintiff\u2019s' condition, actual or perceived, constitutes a mental or physical \u201cimpairment.\u201d <em>Bragdon </em>v. <em>Abbott, supra. </em>Second, we determine whether the life activity curtailed constitutes a \u201cmajor\u201d life activity as defined in G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 1 (20), and its accompanying regulations. <em>Id. </em>Third, \u201ctying the two statutory phrases together, we ask whether the impairment <em>substantially limited </em>the major life activity\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Bragdon </em>v. <em>Abbott, supra. </em>Under this framework, \u201c \u2018it is insufficient ... to merely submit evidence of a medical diagnosis of an impairment.\u2019 . . . Rather, those seeking [G.

Do these constitute a mental impairment? We can imagine that in some cases, what is referred to in lay terms as \u201cstress,\u201d \u201cemotional problems,\u201d or a lack of \u201cmental stability\u201d may constitute an \u201cimpairment\u201d under the statute. We will, therefore, assume, without deciding, that Turgeon satisfied the first step of establishing that he had a perceived \u201cimpairment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">As to the \u201cmajor life activity\u201d at issue, Turgeon alleged that he was \u201cremoved\u201d from two SWAT teams because of the perceived \u201cimpairment.\u201d Although he never addressed the point, the arbitrator concluded, in essence, that the major life activity at issue here was a change in Turgeon\u2019s working conditions. General Laws c. 15IB, \u00a7 1 (20), provides that \u201cmajor life activities\u201d includes \u201cworking.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Giving Turgeon the full benefit of any doubt, we assume for purposes of our analysis (without deciding) that he satisfied the second step, and established that the \u201cmajor life activity\u201d at issue is \u201cworking.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">Finally, we must determine whether Turgeon was perceived to have a mental impairment that \u201csubstantially limited\u201d the major life activity of working. <em>Bragdon </em>v. <em>Abbott, supra </em>at 631. In so doing, we first consider any relevant authority from the MCAD itself. According to its guidelines, \u201c[a]n impairment substantially limits an individual\u2019s ability to work if it prevents or significantly restricts the individual from performing <em>a class of jobs </em>or <em>a broad range of jobs </em>in various classes\u201d (emphasis added). MCAD Guidelines: Employment Discrimination on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>Basis of Handicap Chapter 151B, \u00a7 II.A.6 (1998) (MCAD Guidelines). Those guidelines are entitled to substantial deference. <em>Dahill </em>v. <em>Police Dep\u2019t of Boston, </em>434 Mass. 233, 239 (2001) (\u201cguidelines represent the MCAD\u2019s interpretation of G. L. c. 151B, and are entitled to substantial deference, even though they do not carry the force of law\u201d). Moreover, the MCAD guidelines are, in this respect, identical to the Federal regulations,<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> and are in accord with substantial Federal precedent interpreting those regulations. See, e.g., <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>United Parcel Serv., Inc., </em>527 U.S. 516, 519-520, 523-525 (1999) (no perception of handicap where mechanic with high blood pressure failed Department of Transportation health certification and lost job that required him to drive commercial vehicles, because plaintiff employable in other types of mechanical jobs); <em>Sutton </em>v. <em>United Air Lines, Inc., </em>527 U.S. 471, 475-476, 491-494 (1999) (no perception of handicap where severe myopia prevented complainants from qualifying as commercial airline pilots, because complainants could work as regional pilots or flight instructors)<footnotemark>31</footnotemark>; <em>Carroll </em>v. <em>Xerox Corp., </em>294 F.3d 231, 239-241 (1st Cir. 2002) (no handicap where sales manager suffering from anxiety and stress transferred to nonmanagerial, sales position and then retired, because no evidence he could not work in that class of jobs); <em>Lessard </em>v. <em>Osram Sylvania, Inc., </em>175 F.3d 193, 197-199 (1st Cir. 1999) (no perception of handicap where injured hand prevented plaintiff from perform<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>ing particular welding job, and employer had no other types of welding positions available).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">Although Turgeon in effect argues that we should ignore the MCAD guidelines, we see no reason to do so. A perception that an employee is unable to perform only a particular aspect (SWAT team membership) of a single, particular job (New Bed-ford police officer) is not sufficient to satisfy the \u201csubstantial limitation\u201d requirement of the statute. An employee is \u201cregarded as\u201d having a \u201csubstantial limitation\u201d on the major life activity of \u201cworking\u201d only if his perceived impairment precludes him from performing a class of jobs. Turgeon, of course, returned to active duty as a police officer assuming all of the responsibilities (and withstanding all of the stress) that the position demands. The record is undisputed that he performs the same duties as other officers, some (perhaps many) of whom serve on neither SWAT team. There is no evidence to suggest that Turgeon\u2019s superiors regarded him as limited in his ability to perform as a police officer on active duty. There is no evidence to suggest that he could not find employment as a police officer in any other city, State, or Federal police department, or in a \u201cbroad range of jobs\u201d such as any other law enforcement position or as a security guard for a private employer. That Turgeon\u2019s superiors assigned him to full-time active duty as a patrolman affirmatively and conclusively demonstrates that they did not regard him as substantially limited in the major life activity of working.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">The MCAD suggests an alternate argument to defend its decision to affirm the arbitrator\u2019s award. It argues that the \u201cmajor fife activity\u201d at issue in this case is not \u201cworking,\u201d but \u201cmental and emotional processes such as thinking, concentrating and interacting with others,\u201d and that Turgeon\u2019s superiors regarded him as having an \u201cimpairment\u201d that \u201csubstantially limited\u201d those activities. We will assume, solely for the purpose of considering MCAD\u2019s theory, that \u201cmental and emotional processes such as thinking, concentrating and interacting with others\u201d were the \u201cmajor life activities\u201d at issue in this case.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> To prevail under the MCAD\u2019s theory, there must be credible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>evidence that Turgeon\u2019s superiors in the department regarded him as \u201csubstantially limited\u201d in his ability to think, concentrate, and interact with others, as compared to the ability of the average person in the general population.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> There is no such evidence. When Turgeon returned to active duty he was provided with a lethal weapon and assigned to patrol duties, undertaking all of the responsibilities of a uniformed police officer. It is inconceivable that Turgeon\u2019s supervisors would have him assume these responsibilities if they regarded his ability to think, concentrate, and interact with others as substantially less than that of the average person on the street. The day-today work of a police officer on patrol is demanding in every respect, physically and mentally. His exercise of judgment, his capacity to react appropriately, often within a split second, and his interaction with people in stressful circumstances are the very essence of a police officer\u2019s responsibilities. If (as we strongly doubt) the arbitrator\u2019s decision, or the MCAD\u2019s independent decision based on its own review of the record, was based on a finding to the contrary, it was \u201cpalpably wrong.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">We recognize that a decision to proceed to arbitration is ordinarily a choice to avoid cumbersome legal proceedings. We do not require that an arbitrator\u2019s decision under Policy 96-1 have the fine texture of a reasoned agency decision. But a decision to resolve a discrimination claim under MCAD\u2019s ADR program does not confer unfettered discretion on an arbitrator. Employees may be subjected to workplace decisions that they perceive are unfair, ill conceived, arbitrary, or vindictive. An employer\u2019s decision may in fact be any (or all) of these. But not every claim of workplace unfairness is a claim of discrimina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>tian, and the MCAD has no jurisdiction to order relief for workplace disputes that arise for reasons other than discrimination. Turgeon was distressed and frustrated by the decision to remove him from the department\u2019s SWAT teams, and his distress and frustration may well be justified. But he has not demonstrated that the decision was made because he was regarded as \u201chandicapped\u201d under our antidiscrimination laws. Nothing in our decision should suggest that Turgeon was or remains unqualified for participation in the SWAT teams. That determination remains properly and exclusively with the New Bedford police department.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">5. <em>Remaining claims. </em>Because of our decision, we need not consider the city\u2019s argument that the arbitrator improperly considered allegations that Moniz retaliated against Turgeon for exercising his rights under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, although we note that those allegations do not constitute claims of discrimination. We similarly need not consider its claims that the arbitrator incorrectly concluded that the city did not proffer legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for its actions, or that the remedies imposed by the arbitrator were beyond the authority of the MCAD. We note only that an arbitrator proceeding under MCAD Policy 96-1 may impose only those remedies available under G. L. c. 151B. See Policy 96-1, \u00a7 1.7(c).<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">We affirm the judgment dismissing Turgeon\u2019s request for confirmation of the arbitrator\u2019s award under G.

In the first Superior Court action, the MCAD argued that judicial review of arbitration awards under Policy 96-1 should proceed only under G. L. c. 251. In the second Superior Court action, the MCAD hewed to this same position, explaining that the MCAD\u2019s review of an arbitration award under Policy 96-1 was not a \u201cfinal\u201d agency action under the MCAD\u2019s regulations; that employment discrimination claims voluntarily submitted to arbitration should be treated as any other labor dispute and exempt from G. L. c. 30A review; that application of G. L. c. 30A defeats the finality of the ADR process; and that the parties did not agree to G. L. c. 30A review when they submitted their dispute to arbitration. On appeal here it has abandoned that position.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">When the Superior Court judge in the second action rejected MCAD\u2019s G. L. c. 251 position, MCAD then argued that the standard of review should be whether the MCAD\u2019s decision was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law. See G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (7). On appeal here the MCAD argues that judicial review of its decision should be limited to a review for \u201cabuse of discretion.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b481-7\">Speciflcally, the arbitrator determined that Turgeon\u2019s superiors were concerned about his \u201cemotional stability\u201d and felt that he \u201cstill suffered from stress\u201d from the fatal shooting.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b481-8\">Turgeon argues on appeal that there was also evidence that he had an \u201cactual\u201d impairment, that he had a \u201crecord\u201d of an impairment, and that he had a work-related injury. See G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 75B. It is too late for Turgeon to pursue these claims. In his MCAD complaint, Turgeon claimed only a \u201cperceived\u201d impairment. We would normally limit our review to that claim. In their submission, however, the parties asked the arbitrator to determine whether Turgeon had a \u201crecord of\u201d impairment as well as a \u201cperceived\u201d impairment. The city agreed to that submission and is bound by it. The arbitrator\u2019s decision, however, addresses only Turgeon\u2019s \u201cperceived\u201d impairment. Turgeon did not seek reconsideration of this ruling to address his \u201crecord of\u201d impairment claim, and took no appeal to the MCAD. Accordingly, Turgeon has waived any claim of an \u201cactual\u201d impairment, a \u201crecord of\u201d having an impairment or a \u201cwork-related\u201d injury.
