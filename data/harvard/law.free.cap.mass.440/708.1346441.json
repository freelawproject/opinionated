L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>c. 35, \u00a7 51,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to John Novero, who had served as classification and treatment director of the Plymouth County house of correction for nine years, that his job would be eliminated as a result of a reorganization of the sheriff\u2019s department, and that a new position, director of program services, would be established. The sheriff gave Novero a hearing pursuant to \u00a7 51, and the discharge was affirmed. Novero appealed from the decision to the Plymouth County personnel board (board). See G. L. c. 35, \u00a7\u00a7 48, 51. The sheriff was the only witness at the hearing before the board, and he explained that his decision was based solely on a departmental \u201creorganization.\u201d At the end of the sheriff\u2019s case, Novero made a motion in the nature of a directed verdict and argued that he was entitled to reinstatement because the sheriff had not met his burden of showing that Novero\u2019s position had been abolished, where the undisputed evidence indicated that the newly created position and Novero\u2019s position were essentially the same.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The board discussed the case briefly, voted, and by a two-to-one decision orally ordered Novero reinstated. The board subsequently issued a letter that set forth the vote in writing but did not state the reasons for reinstatement.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">The sheriff brought an action in the nature of certiorari to review the board\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He claimed that the board\u2019s decision should be vacated because the board misallocated the burden of proof; failed to provide written reasons for its decision; and failed to render a written decision. A judge in the Superior Court affirmed the board\u2019s decision to reinstate Novero, concluding that the outcome was unaffected by the burden of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>proof; the failure by the board to state its reasons in writing was harmless because \u201cit was clear from the record that there could only be one ground for the termination . . . [, i.e.,] the board could only have decided as it did if it found that the change in Novero\u2019s duties did not constitute part of a \u2018reorganization\u2019 \u201d; and the board\u2019s failure to render a written decision was of no consequence because the board members unambiguously articulated their decision at the conclusion of the hearing.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">The sheriff appealed to the Appeals Court, which vacated the judgment of the Superior Court on ground that the record allowed for multiple interpretations of the board\u2019s reasoning. The Appeals Court remanded the case to the board for clarification of its reasons, or a new hearing. See <em>McDonough </em>v. <em>Plymouth County Personnel Bd., </em>57 Mass. App. Ct. 788 (2003). We granted the application of the board and Novero for further appellate review. We affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">1. <em>Standard of review. </em>General Laws c. 249, \u00a7 4, establishes limited judicial review in the nature of certiorari \u201cto correct errors in proceedings which are not according to the course of the common law . . . not otherwise reviewable,\u201d as here. Certiorari allows a court to \u201ccorrect only a substantial error of law, evidenced by the record, which adversely affects a material right of the plaintiff. ... In its review, the court may rectify only those errors of law which have resulted in manifest injustice to the plaintiff or which have adversely affected the real interests of the general public.\u201d <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth. </em>v. <em>Auditor of the Commonwealth, </em>430 Mass. 783, 790 (2000), quoting <em>Carney </em>v. <em>Springfield, </em>403 Mass. 604, 605 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b730-7\">2. <em>Statement of reasons. </em>The sheriff argues that the board was required to produce a written statement of findings or reasons for its decision. General Laws c. 35, \u00a7 51, only requires that the decision, not the reasoning, be in writing. <em>McDonough </em>v. <em>Plymouth County Personnel Bd., supra </em>at 790. A requirement of written reasons in support of a decision has been imposed on other decision makers. For example, the Legislature explicitly requires State agencies to provide a written statement of reasons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>for their decisions. G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 11 (8) (\u201cThe decision shall be accompanied by a statement of reasons for the decision . . .\u201d). The civil service law provides: \u201cUpon completion of the hearing, the member or hearing officer shall file forthwith a report of his findings with the commission . . . [which] shall render a written decision and send notice thereof to all parties concerned.\u201d G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 43. The absence of such a requirement in G. L. c. 35, \u00a7 51, suggests that the Legislature did not intend to impose a similar requirement on county personnel boards. Written findings are helpful to a reviewing court, and generally are necessary for meaningful review; but they are not necessary where the board\u2019s reasoning is otherwise apparent. <em>Id. </em>See <em>Desmarais </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>363 Mass. 883, 883 (1973) (\u201cbetter practice calls for explicit findings of fact by the agency and a statement of reasons for its decision\u201d). Here, no such writing was necessary because the board\u2019s reasoning can be determined with reasonable certainty from the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">The board\u2019s vote, which followed the singular testimony of the sheriff, could only be interpreted as resting on the structure of the sheriff\u2019s reorganization of Novero\u2019s position. The sheriff\u2019s sole justification for discharging Novero was based on his \u201creorganization\u201d of the department and not Novero\u2019s job performance.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> A position may be abolished pursuant to a genuine reorganization plan if the reorganization would, for example, promote efficiency and economy, see <em>School Comm. of Salem </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>348 Mass. 696, 698-699 (1965), or if the position is no longer necessary. See <em>Mayor of Somerville </em>v. <em>District Court of Somerville, </em>317 Mass. 106, 123 (1944), quoting <em>Gardner </em>v. <em>Lowell, </em>221 Mass. 150, 154 (1915). Where, as here, the position remained essentially unchanged after the reorganization, it is sufficiently clear that the board rejected the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>sheriff\u2019s characterization of Novero\u2019s discharge as incidental to a genuine reorganization. See <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Third Dist. Court of E. Middlesex, </em>316 Mass. 663, 667-668 (1944); <em>McNeil </em>v. <em>Mayor &amp; City Council of Peabody, </em>297 Mass. 499, 504 (1937). The absence of any written reason was, therefore, inconsequential.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">We disagree with the Appeals Court\u2019s conclusion that \u201cthe record discloses several possible bases for the board\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>McDonough </em>v. <em>Plymouth County Personnel Bd., supra </em>at 790. There was no basis to suppose, as the Appeals Court suggests, that the board might have concluded that \u201cthe reorganization was neither carefully considered nor consistent with sound penology,\u201d or that \u201cthe sheriff had used a genuine reorganization as a pretext for discharging Novero.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 790-791. The case was tried on the theory that there was no \u201cgenuine reorganization,\u201d not that the reorganization was ill conceived or used as a pretext. The simple focus of Novero\u2019s case was that there can be no valid job reorganization where one job is replaced by its functional equivalent in a single new position, and such a \u201creorganization\u201d may not provide \u201cjust cause\u201d for discharge. See <em>Cambridge Hous. Auth. </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Comm\u2019n, 1 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 586, 590 (1979). Cf. <em>McNeil </em>v. <em>Mayor &amp; City Council of Peabody, supra. </em>Contrary to the Appeals Court\u2019s observation about the board member who quoted from <em>Cambridge Hous. Auth. </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Comm\u2019n, supra </em>at 589, the board member was not commenting on the wisdom of the reorganization or the use of a genuine reorganization as a pretext for adverse action, but on the genuineness of the reorganization itself. He was questioning whether a job properly could be considered abolished as \u201cunnecessary\u201d or \u201cno longer necessary\u201d where it has been replaced by a new position that was its functional equivalent. See <em>McDonough </em>v. <em>Plymouth County Personnel Bd., supra </em>at 791 nn.6 &amp; 7. The only reasonable conclusion to draw from the board\u2019s decision is that two board members determined that the sheriff failed to show that Novero had been discharged for just cause based on a genuine reorganization.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">3. <em>Burden of proof. </em>The sheriff contends that his burden was one of mere production and that Novero was required to prove that the \u201creorganization\u201d was a pretext for a malevolent motive. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>The sheriff further contends that he met his burden by producing evidence of his reasons for eliminating Novero\u2019s position and for refusing to reassign Novero to the \u201cnewly created\u201d position, but that Novero failed to meet his burden of proving that the sheriff acted in bad faith by using \u201creorganization\u201d as a pretext for unlawful discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">General Laws c. 35, \u00a7 51, states that \u201c[i]f the board finds that the action of the appointing authority <em>was justified, </em>such action shall be affirmed; otherwise, it shall be reversed and the person concerned shall be returned to his office or position without loss of compensation\u201d (emphasis added). For the reasons stated by the Appeals Court, \u00a7 51 is modeled somewhat on the civil service laws and, in particular, G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 41, and that the burden of proof fell on the sheriff to show that Novero was discharged \u201cfor just cause,\u201d here, that the discharge was due to a genuine reorganization. See <em>McDonough </em>v. <em>Plymouth County Personnel Bd., supra </em>at 791. The record indicates that the sheriff was aware of his burden, as his counsel devoted his opening statement and his direct examination of the sheriff to the theory that Novero\u2019s discharge was the result of a genuine reorganization. Further, the sheriff never argued before the board that the burden of proof rested with Novero, and he did not object to the use of the directed verdict procedure to test the sufficiency of his prima facie case. Where the evidence failed to show more than a de minimis difference between Novero\u2019s position and the newly created post, the board could properly conclude that the sheriff did not satisfy his burden of proving that Novero\u2019s position was abolished pursuant to a genuine reorganization.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">Contrary to the sheriff\u2019s claim that the board improperly substituted its judgment for his, see <em>School Comm. of Salem </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Comm\u2019n, supra </em>at 699, the board recognized that when a newly created position is the functional equivalent of an abolished position, it is not the product of a genuine reorganization. The board correctly recognized that such a decision could not supply \u201cjust cause\u201d to discharge Novero.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">Because the sheriff failed to meet his burden of proof, we need not consider whether Novero was required to show evidence of bad faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>4. <em>Policy-making position. </em>The sheriff argues in the alternative that he was entitled to discharge Novero and select an individual of his choice because the position was a high level policy-making position whose occupant could be discharged at the will of the sheriff. His reliance on cases that recognize political loyalty and affiliation as appropriate job requirements is misplaced. See, e.g., <em>O\u2019Connor </em>v. <em>Steeves, </em>994 F.2d 905, 909 (1st Cir. 1993), and cases cited. Unlike the employees in those cases, Novero is not an at-will employee. Novero is a tenured county employee who may only be discharged for just cause under G. L. c. 35, \u00a7 51, and the sheriff proceeded under that statute. General Laws c. 35, \u00a7 51, gives tenure to all county employees who have completed five years of service unless otherwise exempted by the statute. Novero\u2019s position was not exempted.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b729-6\">General Laws c. 35, \u00a7 51, states in relevant part: \u201cAny employee subject to [\u00a7\u00a7 48-56], inclusive, except [employees in certain enumerated positions not applicable here] . . . who has completed at least five years of service may not be discharged from such employment except for just cause and for reasons specifically given him in writing by the appointing authority. Before any such discharge is effected, the employee shall be given a full hearing before the appointing authority. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">\u201cIf within five days after receiving written notice of the decision of the appointing authority, the person so discharged shall so request in writing, he shall be given a hearing before the [county personnel] board.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b729-8\">The sheriff\u2019s counsel admitted that Novero\u2019s position and the newly created one \u201clook alike.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b729-9\">Novero challenged the sheriff\u2019s right to seek judicial review in the nature of certiorari. We need not address this argument because the result is unaffected.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b730-8\">Because the sheriff did not raise this last issue on appeal it is deemed waived. See Mass. R. A. P. 16 (a) (4), as amended, 367 Mass. 921 (1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b731-6\">In his supplemental brief, the sheriff argues for the first time that Novero\u2019s termination was the result of his job performance. This claim was not made to the board. Thus, we decline to consider the issue. See <em>Still </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dep\u2019t of Employment &amp; Training, </em>423 Mass. 805, 808 n.3 (1996). Moreover, there is no evidence that the sheriff based Novero\u2019s discharge on performance. When asked whether Novero was discharged for any violation of a rule, regulation, or conduct, the sheriff responded, \u201cNot at this time.\u201d Further, the evidence reveals that Novero had received excellent evaluations from the deputy superintendent from 1992 through 2000.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
