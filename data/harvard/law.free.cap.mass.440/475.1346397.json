We imposed that duty in order to \u201cactualize the abstract right[]\u201d to consult with an attorney prescribed by <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436 (1966). <em>Mavredakis, supra </em>at 860. This rule was announced in the wake of <em>Moran </em>v. <em>Burbine, </em>475 U.S. 412 (1986), in which the United States Supreme Court held that the Fifth Amendment did not require that police inform a suspect of an attorney\u2019s efforts to make contact with him because \u201c[e]vents occurring outside of the presence of the suspect and entirely unknown to him surely . . . have no bearing on the capacity to comprehend and knowingly relinquish a constitutional right.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 422.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">In the present case, we must determine the reach of the <em>Mavredakis </em>rule, and, in particular, whether suppression is required where the suspect retained and consulted with counsel prior to his arrest, was informed of his right to have counsel present when he waived his Miranda rights and spoke to the police, but was not informed that several days prior to the arrest his attorney had told the police that he wanted to be present during any interview of his client. A judge in the Superior Court held that <em>Mavredakis </em>required the defendant to be informed of his attorney\u2019s statement to the police and suppressed the statements made during the interview. The Commonwealth\u2019s application for interlocutory appeal was granted by a single justice of this court and the appeal was entered in the Appeals Court. We transferred the case here on our own motion. Because we conclude that the concerns that underlie the <em>Mavredakis </em>rule are not present in the circumstances of this case, we reverse the allowance of the motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>We take the facts from the motion judge\u2019s findings and undisputed testimony presented at the hearing on the motion to suppress. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hinds, </em>437 Mass. 54, 55 (2002), cert, denied, 537 U.S. 1205 (2003). On November 22, 2000, the Seekonk police department began an investigation into allegations of sexual abuse against the defendant, Donald Collins. On November 27, Detective Russell Brennan of the Seekonk police department located Collins at his place of business in Providence, Rhode Island, and arranged to meet and interview him at 5 p.m. on November 28 at the Seekonk police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>department. On November 28, Collins telephoned Brennan and postponed the meeting with him until the following day, November 29, so that he could \u201chire an attorney and speak to an attorney.\u201d On November 29, Attorney Mark Bond contacted Brennan, stated that he represented Collins, and wanted to be present at the interview later that day, but could not attend. Consequently, Bond rescheduled the interview for November 30. On November 30, Bond contacted Brennan and cancelled that interview as well. There is no evidence that the police had contact with Collins during this period of time, presumably leaving it to Bond to inform Coffins as to the rescheduling of the planned interview. '</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\">After the November 30 interview was cancelled, Brennan applied for, and the Taunton District Court issued, a warrant for Collins\u2019s arrest. Brennan informed the Providence police department, which thereafter took Coffins into custody. Coffins agreed to rendition and, on December 1, Brennan and Investigator Thomas Carroll of the Bristol County district attorney\u2019s office brought Coffins from the Adult Correctional Institution in Cranston, Rhode Island, to the Seekonk police department. On the way, Brennan and Carroll asked Coffins identifying questions (name, date of birth, social security number), and advised him of his Miranda rights. Coffins volunteered that \u201che had been in touch with a lawyer,\u201d was aware that a meeting had been scheduled at the Seekonk police station, and \u201cwas embarrassed by his lawyer\u2019s behavior\u201d in not getting the interview arranged. He went on to say that he had nothing to hide and was willing to speak with them.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">At the Seekonk police department, Brennan again advised Coffins of his Miranda rights, and Coffins signed a notification of rights form on which he also initialled each of the five enumerated rights. Coffins reiterated that he was embarrassed by his attorney\u2019s actions in not getting an interview set up with the police, said he had nothing to hide, and proceeded to answer questions posed by Brennan and Carroll. Brennan never informed Collins of Bond\u2019s request of November 29 to be present at the interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">Coffins was subsequently indicted for forcible rape of a child under sixteen years, and indecent assault and battery on a child <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>under age fourteen years. Prior to trial, Collins moved to suppress the evidence obtained as a result of the December 1 interview. A hearing was held at which Brennan and Carroll testified. The judge found that \u201cthe interview of the defendant was polite, calm and non-threatening,\u201d that \u201cCollins was always cooperative in answering . . . questions,\u201d that Collins \u201cwas not confused by any of the questioning,\u201d and that he never asked to speak with his attorney. She also found that Collins denied any sexual contact with the complainant.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, she found that the police \u201cfailed to inform this defendant that his attorney wanted to be present for the interview,\u201d that there was \u201cno showing that the defendant was aware of his attorney\u2019s desire to be present during questioning,\u201d or \u201cthat the attorney would not have appeared at the police station within a reasonable time were he informed that the defendant was in custody and would be interviewed.\u201d She concluded that \u201c[bjecause of the failure of the police to inform this defendant of a specific communication from his attorney that bears directly on this defendant\u2019s right to counsel, the defendant\u2019s statements must be suppressed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>\u201cThe Commonwealth has the burden of establishing the validity of a Miranda waiver beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vao Sok, </em>435 Mass. 743, 751 (2002). \u201cTo be valid the waiver must be made voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Edwards, </em>420 Mass. 666, 670 (1995). In determining its validity, a court must analyze the \u201ctotality of the circumstances.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>432 Mass. 82, 85 (2000). Within this construct, <em>Mavredakis </em>established a \u201cbright-line rule, providing that police must stop questioning and inform a suspect immediately of attempts of an attorney identifying himself or herself as counsel acting on the suspect\u2019s behalf to contact the suspect.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Beland, </em>436 Mass. 273, 287 (2002). <em>Mavredakis, supra </em>at 861 (\u201cduty to inform applies whether the attorney telephones or arrives at the station\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cThe consequence of the failure so to inform a suspect is that any waiver of rights that has been given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>becomes \u2018inoperative\u2019 for further admissions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In essence, a suspect cannot make an informed waiver of his Miranda rights if he is kept ignorant by police of an attorney\u2019s attempts to provide him with assistance and advice. If the waiver is not informed, it is not valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">The concerns underlying the rule are amply set forth in <em>Mavredakis: </em>\u201c[T]here is an important difference between the abstract right to speak with an attorney mentioned in the Miranda warnings, and a concrete opportunity to meet \u2018with an identified attorney actually able to provide at least initial assistance and advice,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 859, quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Haynes, </em>288 Or. 59, 72 (1979), cert, denied, 446 U.S. 945 (1980); knowledge of an attorney\u2019s efforts to render assistance is necessary to actualize that abstract right at the time a suspect is faced with a decision whether to waive his constitutional rights; and \u201c[a]ny other approach would lend tacit approval to affirmative police interference with the attorney-client relationship.\u201d <em>Mavredakis, supra </em>at 860.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">If, as here, a suspect volunteers that he has retained and consulted with an attorney regarding a police request to interview him, the conclusion that the suspect is fully cognizant of his right to consult with counsel is virtually inescapable. The Miranda warnings received prior to such an interview do not constitute \u201can abstract offer to call some unknown lawyer,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sherman, </em>389 Mass. 287, 291 (1983), quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Haynes, supra, </em>but an invitation to contact the very lawyer that he has retained to represent him in the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">Additionally, this is not a case in which a lawyer has been denied access to a client in custody or under interrogation. See <em>Mavredakis, supra </em>at 861-862 (police policy of forbidding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>contact between third parties and persons being interviewed violates art. 12 if applied to attorneys attempting to contact their clients). Nor is it a case in which a suspect under interrogation, or about to be interrogated, has been kept unaware that a lawyer, purporting to act on his behalf, is attempting to render advice and assistance. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mahnke, </em>368 Mass. 662, 692 (1975), cert, denied, 425 U.S. 959 (1976) (waiver not voluntary where injured suspect not notified of calls made by attorney to police on learning that client was to be interviewed at hospital); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McKenna, </em>355 Mass. 313, 325 (1969) (same where suspect not notified of telephone call made by his attorney to police during interview).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">Collins argues, however, that his statements should be suppressed because the circumstances in which they were made are closely akin to those present in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sherman, supra. </em>In the <em>Sherman </em>case, an attorney, who had been appointed to represent the defendant on a pending criminal charge, learned that the police intended to question him concerning unrelated crimes, and informed the police that she wished to be present at the questioning. When the police picked the defendant up a few hours later, they failed to inform the defendant of the attorney\u2019s request. We held the defendant\u2019s waiver of his Miranda rights at that questioning to be invalid because he was kept ignorant of the attorney\u2019s request and therefore did not know that there was \u201can identified attorney actually available to provide at least initial assistance and advice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 291, quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Haynes, supra. </em>Importantly, there was no evidence that the defendant had consulted the attorney about the case under investigation, or was even aware that the attorney was willing or available to advise him on that matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">Where, as here, a suspect has retained and consulted with an attorney concerning the matter under investigation, it cannot be said that the right to consult with counsel is \u201cabstract\u201d; and where the police have done nothing to impede the contact or the flow of information or advice between lawyer and client (includ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>ing, e.g., failing to notify the defendant of attempts by the lawyer to contact him), our concerns regarding interference with the attorney-client relationship are simply not present. In these circumstances, the rule does not apply, and to extend it would unduly burden law enforcement with responsibilities that firmly belong with attorneys and defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">The judge\u2019s allowance of the motion to suppress on the ground that the <em>Mavredakis </em>rule was violated by the police is reversed. The case is remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b498-6\">Although Collins denied sexual contact with the complainant, statements made during the interview were inculpatory in other respects.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b498-7\">It long has been clear in Massachusetts, however, that the police have no inherent constitutional duty to inform a defendant\u2019s attorney that the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>has been arrested or even that the defendant, already arrested, will be interrogated. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sherman, </em>389 Mass. 287, 291 (1983); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Santo, </em>375 Mass. 299, 305 (1978); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Andujar, </em>7 Mass. App. Ct. <em>777, </em>783 (1979). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mandeville, </em>386 Mass. 393, 401 (1982). While our law requires the police to facilitate the attempts of those in custody to contact their attorneys, the police need not make the telephone calls themselves. See G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 33A.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b499-10\">The rule was not intended to alter the principle that \u201cresponsibility for invoking the protections guaranteed by <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>[384 U.S. 436 (1966)], and art. 12 rests squarely in the hands of criminal defendants.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Beland, </em>436 Mass. 273, 288 (2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b500-7\">While the decisions in these cases preceded <em>Moran </em>v. <em>Burbine, </em>475 U.S. 412 (1986), and appear to be founded more on Federal constitutional rights than art. 12, we concluded in <em>Mavredakis, supra, </em>that they survived <em>Moran </em>v. <em>Burbine, supra, </em>and were still good law under art. 12.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b501-7\">In his initial motion to suppress, the defendant also argued that the police continued to question him after he requested that the interview end and invoked his right to have an attorney present. The Superior Court granted the defendant\u2019s motion on the Mavredakis-based argument, and therefore did not rule on this alternate ground. Based on her findings of fact that were to the contrary, the claim is without merit.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
