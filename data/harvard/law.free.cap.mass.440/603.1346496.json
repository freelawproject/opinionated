McDonough (employee) worked for the Boston Edison Company from 1961 until his voluntary retirement in 1991. He was diagnosed with a metastatic adenocarcinoma and asbestosis four and one-half years after he retired from the company, and died soon afterward. His widow, the claimant, made a claim for benefits under \u00a7 31 of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, G. L. c. 152, which provides for compensation to certain survivors of workers who die because of an injury suffered in the course of their employment. An administrative judge of the Department of Industrial Accidents (department) determined that the employee was exposed to asbestos fibers at work prior to December, 1978, and that his employer was liable under the workers\u2019 compensation system, but denied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>\u00a7 31 benefits because the employee voluntarily had retired and had no earnings in the year preceding his death. The reviewing board of the department reversed the administrative judge\u2019s denial of \u00a7 31 benefits, ordering payment \u201cat rates mandated by \u00a7 35C and 452 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 3.02.\u201d The employer\u2019s insurer appealed from the board\u2019s decision, and we transferred the case from the Appeals Court on our own motion. We vacate the board\u2019s decision, concluding that the plain language of G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 35C, does not support the payment of compensation to the claimant, and that, to the extent that 452 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 3.02(1) (1999) would provide otherwise, the regulation is invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>In Res. 1910, c. 120, the Legislature established the Massachusetts commission on compensation for industrial accidents to \u201cdetermine upon a plan of compensating employees for injuries received in the course of their employment.\u201d This was \u201cthe logical outcome of a long-continued and increasing demand for the modification or abandonment of the common-law remedies as applied to the relationship of employers and injured employees.\u201d Report of the Commission on Compensation for Industrial Accidents 14 (July 1, 1912). Since enacted in St. 1911, c. 751, the Massachusetts workers\u2019 compensation scheme has been conceived as a mechanism by which workers can recover a portion of that income that they are kept from earning because of an injury suffered while working. See generally L. Locke, Workers\u2019 Compensation 1-11, 18-22 (L.Y. Nason, C.W. Koziol, &amp; R. Wall Supp. 2002); L. Locke, Workmen\u2019s Compensation 1-15, 22-26 (2d ed. 1981). Since 1911, we have been consistent in our efforts to give effect to this purpose. See, e.g., <em>Letteney\u2019s Case, </em>429 Mass. 280, 282 (1999) (\u201cour workers\u2019 compensation law was conceived as a system of insurance to replace in part the wages lost by workers or their dependents as a result of injuries suffered in connection with their work\u201d); <em>Tobin\u2019s Case, </em>424 Mass. 250, 253 (1997) (\u201cworkers\u2019 compensation law was designed to provide wage-loss protection to employees who are injured on the job and incur a loss of earning capacity from the injury\u201d); <em>Ahmed\u2019s Case, </em>278 Mass. 180, 183 (1932) (\u201c[workers\u2019] compensation ... is by way of relief from inability to earn, or for deprivation of support flowing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>from, wages theretofore received by the employee\u201d). While we are careful not to \u201cread into [the workers\u2019 compensation statute] by implication or enlargement provisions not fairly within its terms,\u201d <em>Moran\u2019s Case, </em>234 Mass. 152, 155 (1919), and note that \u201cits express provisions cannot be extended beyond their reasonable import,\u201d <em>id., </em>we recognize that it \u201cis to be construed broadly ... in the light of its purpose and ... to promote the accomplishment of its beneficent design,\u201d <em>Johnson\u2019s Case, </em>318 Mass. 741, 746 (1945). We interpret G. L. c. 152, \u00a7\u00a7 31 and 35C, an integral part of the workers\u2019 compensation scheme, in light of these principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">Section 31 of G. L. c. 152 provides for payment to the dependents of an employee who dies as the result of an injury.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201c[Dependents of the employee . . . wholly dependent upon his or her earnings for support at the time of his or her injury, or . . . death\u201d may receive weekly payments amounting to two-thirds of the deceased employee\u2019s wages.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 31. Section 35C provides that \u201c[w]hen there is a difference of five years or more between the date of injury and the initial date [of] eligibility] for benefits under section thirty-one . . . the applicable benefits shall be those in effect on the first date of eligibility for benefits.\u201d Thus, \u00a7 31 is the doorway to compensation, and in cases in which at least five years have elapsed between injury and eligibility, \u00a7 35C is the mechanism by which the amount of compensation is calculated.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">In cases of latent injury, the date of injury is the date of last exposure. See <em>Squillante\u2019s Case, </em>389 Mass. 396, 397 (1983). Here, the administrative judge determined that the date of last exposure was December, 1978, and we accept the judge\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>finding.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See <em>Scheffler\u2019s Case, </em>419 Mass. 251, 258-259 (1994). The date of eligibility for benefits under \u00a7 31 is the date of death, here May 10, 1996. Thus, in this case, nearly two decades passed between the date of injury and the date of eligibility, so \u00a7 35C applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">Following the \u00a7 35C instruction that \u201cthe applicable benefits shall be those in effect on the first date of eligibility for benefits,\u201d the compensation available to the claimant is two-thirds of her husband\u2019s wages on the date of his death. See G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 31. On that date, he had no wages, however they might be defined. The claimant\u2019s husband voluntarily retired from the workforce at age sixty-five in 1991. He did not reenter the workforce between the time of his retirement and the onset of his illness, and there was no evidence that he had any intention of ever doing so. When he retired, he took his pension as a lump sum, and was not in receipt of any stream of eamings-related income at the time of his death. In these circumstances, \u00a7 35C provides no benefits to the claimant. This result, while appearing harsh, is consistent with the purpose of the workers\u2019 compensation law: workers\u2019 compensation is an earnings-replacement or wage-loss protection mechanism, not a life insurance scheme. Cf. <em>Aetna Life &amp; Cas. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. 373, 377 (2000), quoting <em>Zerofski\u2019s Case, </em>385 Mass. 590, 594 (1982) (\u201c \u2018[Pjurpose of [workers\u2019 compensation] is to treat the cost of personal injuries incidental to . . . employment as a part of the cost of business.\u2019 ... \u2018It is not a scheme for health insurance\u2019 \u201d). Here, there was no loss of earnings, and, consequently, no replacement benefits were warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">That \u00a7 35C is ameliorative in nature does not aid the claimant. As we explained in <em>Letteney\u2019s Case, supra </em>at 282, G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 35C, inserted by St. 1985, c. 572, \u00a7 45, reversed the result in <em>Squillante\u2019s Case, supra. </em>In the latter case we held that compensation for an employee incapacitated from work in 1974 by asbestosis that he developed as the result of exposure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>in 1945 was to be calculated on the basis of his wages on the date of injury (the last exposure in 1945), not the date of incapacity. <em>Squillante\u2019s Case, supra </em>at 396-397. Were the facts in <em>Squillante\u2019s Case </em>to arise under the new \u00a7 35C scheme (which applies to incapacity as well as death), the compensation would have been calculated on the basis of his much higher wages in 1974. In this sense, \u00a7 35C indeed is ameliorative. That it is ameliorative, however, does not mean that we may ignore its express terms to allow for payments where no right to payments exists. Cf. <em>Moran\u2019s Case, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">To the extent that the board reaches a different result by applying the provisions of 452 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 3.02(1), that application is misplaced. The regulation instructs that, if there are no earnings on the date of eligibility, the benefits determination under \u00a7 35C should be calculated from the employee\u2019s average weekly wage as of his last date of employment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We recognize that, in circumstances not present here, this regulation could be construed and applied in a manner consistent with the meaning and purpose of the statute, and therefore the regulation is not invalid for all purposes.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See <em>Beth Israel Hosp. Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Med., </em>401 Mass. 172, 183 (1987). Cf. <em>Berrios </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Welfare, </em>411 Mass. 587, 595 (1992) (\u201cregulations are . . . void [if] their provisions cannot <em>by any reasonable construction </em>be interpreted in harmony with the legislative mandate\u201d [emphasis added]). However, as applied by the board in the circumstances of this case, the regulation provides benefits that exceed those intended by the statutory scheme and authorized by \u00a7 35C. Insofar as the regulation is in conflict with the terms of the statute, it is invalid. <em>Beth Israel Hosp. Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Med., supra </em>at 182-183. See G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 5 (\u201ccommissioner shall promulgate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>. . . regulations consistent with this chapter\u201d). Cf. <em>Corriveau </em>v. <em>Home Ins. Co., </em>43 Mass. App. Ct. 924 (1997) (holding unenforceable a regulation that would have provided greater workers\u2019 compensation benefits than permitted by statute).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">Neither the \u201cbeneficent design\u201d of workers\u2019 compensation generally nor the ameliorative nature of one of its provisions may trump the plain language and purpose of the statute. The decision of the reviewing board is vacated. This case is remanded to the department for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b625-7\">\u2018If death results from the injury, the insurer shall pay the following dependents of the employee, including his or her children by a former spouse, wholly dependent upon his or her earnings for support at the time of his or her injury, or at the time of his or her death, compensation as follows ....
