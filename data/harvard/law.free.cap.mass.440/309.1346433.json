The exclusive commitment of two individuals to each other nurtures love and mutual support; it brings stability to our society. For those who choose to marry, and for their children, marriage provides an abundance of legal, financial, and social benefits. In return it imposes weighty legal, financial, and social obligations. The question before us is whether, consistent with the Massachusetts Constitution, the Commonwealth may deny the protections, benefits, and obligations conferred by civil marriage to two individuals of the same sex who wish to marry. We conclude that it may not. The Massachusetts Constitution affirms the dignity and equality of all individuals. It forbids the creation of second-class citizens. In reaching our conclusion we have given full deference to the arguments made by the Commonwealth. But it has failed to identify any constitutionally adequate reason for denying civil marriage to same-sex couples.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">We are mindful that our decision marks a change in the history of our marriage law. Many people hold deep-seated religious, moral, and ethical convictions that marriage should be limited to the union of one man and one woman, and that homosexual conduct is immoral. Many hold equally strong religious, moral, and ethical convictions that same-sex couples are entitled to be married, and that homosexual persons should be treated no differently than their heterosexual neighbors. Neither view answers the question before us. Our concern is with the Massachusetts Constitution as a charter of governance for every person properly within its reach. \u201cOur obligation is to define the liberty of all, not to mandate our own moral code.\u201d <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>123 S. Ct. 2472, 2480 (2003) <em>(Lawrence), </em>quoting <em>Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. </em>v. <em>Casey, </em>505 U.S. 833, 850 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-9\">Whether the Commonwealth may use its formidable regula<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>tory authority to bar same-sex couples from civil marriage is a question not previously addressed by a Massachusetts appellate court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It is a question the United States Supreme Court left open as a matter of Federal law in <em>Lawrence, supra </em>at 2484, where it was not an issue. There, the Court affirmed that the core concept of common human dignity protected by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution precludes government intrusion into the deeply personal realms of consensual adult expressions of intimacy and one\u2019s choice of an intimate partner. The Court also reaffirmed the central role that decisions whether to marry or have children bear in shaping one\u2019s identity. <em>Id. </em>at 2481. The Massachusetts Constitution is, if anything, more protective of individual liberty and equality than the Federal Constitution; it may demand broader protection for fundamental rights; and it is less tolerant of government intrusion into the protected spheres of private Ufe.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">Barred access to the protections, benefits, and obfigations of civil marriage, a person who enters into an intimate, exclusive union with another of the same sex is arbitrarily deprived of membership in one of our community\u2019s most rewarding and cherished institutions. That exclusion is incompatible with the constitutional principles of respect for individual autonomy and equafity under law.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">The plaintiffs are fourteen individuals from five Massachusetts counties. As of April 11, 2001, the date they filed their complaint, the plaintiffs Gloria Bailey, sixty years old, and Linda Davies, fifty-five years old, had been in a committed relationship for thirty years; the plaintiffs Maureen Brodoff, forty-nine years old, and Ellen Wade, fifty-two years old, had been in a committed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>relationship for twenty years and lived with their twelve year old daughter; the plaintiffs Hillary Goodridge, forty-four years old, and Julie Goodridge, forty-three years old, had been in a committed relationship for thirteen years and lived with their five year old daughter; the plaintiffs Gary Chalmers, thirty-five years old, and Richard Linnell, thirty-seven years old, had been in a committed relationship for thirteen years and lived with their eight year old daughter and Richard\u2019s mother; the plaintiffs Heidi Norton, thirty-six years old, and Gina Smith, thirty-six years old, had been in a committed relationship for eleven years and lived with their two sons, ages five years and one year; the plaintiffs Michael Horgan, forty-one years old, and Edward Balmelli, forty-one years old, had been in a committed relationship for seven years; and the plaintiffs David Wilson, fifty-seven years old, and Robert Compton, fifty-one years old, had been in a committed relationship for four years and had cared for David\u2019s mother in their home after a serious illness until she died.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">The plaintiffs include business executives, lawyers, an investment banker, educators, therapists, and a computer engineer. Many are active in church, community, and school groups. They have employed such legal means as are available to them \u2014 for example, joint adoption, powers of attorney, and joint ownership of real property \u2014 to secure aspects of their relationships. Each plaintiff attests a desire to marry his or her partner in order to affirm publicly their commitment to each other and to secure the legal protections and benefits afforded to married couples and their children.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">The Department of Public Health (department) is charged by statute with safeguarding public health. See G. L. c. 17. Among its responsibilities, the department oversees the registry of vital records and statistics (registry), which \u201cenforce[s] all laws\u201d relative to the issuance of marriage licenses and the keeping of marriage records, see G. L. c. 17, \u00a7 4, and which promulgates policies and procedures for the issuance of marriage licenses by city and town clerks and registers. See, e.g., G. L. c. 207, \u00a7\u00a7 20, 28A, and 37. The registry is headed by a registrar of vital records and statistics (registrar), appointed by the Commissioner of Public Health (commissioner) with the approval of the public health council and supervised by the commissioner. See G. L. c. 17, \u00a7 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>In March and April, 2001, each of the plaintiff couples attempted to obtain a marriage license from a city or town clerk\u2019s office. As required under G. L. c. 207, they completed notices of intention to marry on forms provided by the registry, see G. L. c. 207, \u00a7 20, and presented these forms to a Massachusetts town or city clerk, together with the required health forms and marriage license fees. See G. L. c. 207, \u00a7 19. In each case, the clerk either refused to accept the notice of intention to marry or denied a marriage license to the couple on the ground that Massachusetts does not recognize same-sex marriage.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Because obtaining a marriage license is a necessary prerequisite to civil marriage in Massachusetts, denying marriage licenses to the plaintiffs was tantamount to denying them access to civil marriage itself, with its appurtenant social and legal protections, benefits, and obligations.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">On April 11, 2001, the plaintiffs filed suit in the Superior Court against the department and the commissioner seeking a judgment that \u201cthe exclusion of the [pjlaintiff couples and other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>qualified same-sex couples from access to marriage licenses, and the legal and social status of civil marriage, as well as the protections, benefits and obligations of marriage, violates Massachusetts law.\u201d See G. L. c. 231 A. The plaintiffs alleged violation of the laws of the Commonwealth, including but not limited to their rights under arts. 1, 6, 7, 10, 12, and 16, and Part II, c. 1, \u00a7 1, art. 4, of the Massachusetts Constitution.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The department, represented by the Attorney General, admitted to a policy and practice of denying marriage licenses to same-sex <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>couples. It denied that its actions violated any law or that the plaintiffs were entitled to relief. The parties filed cross motions for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">A Superior Court judge ruled for the department. In a memorandum of decision and order dated May 7, 2002, he dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that the marriage statutes should be construed to permit marriage between persons of the same sex, holding that the plain wording of G. L. c. 207, as well as the wording of other marriage statutes, precluded that interpretation. Turning to the constitutional claims, he held that the marriage exclusion does not offend the liberty, freedom, equality, or due process provisions of the Massachusetts Constitution, and that the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights does not guarantee \u201cthe fundamental right to marry a person of the same sex.\u201d He concluded that prohibiting same-sex marriage rationally furthers the Legislature\u2019s legitimate interest in safeguarding the \u201cprimary purpose\u201d of marriage, \u201cprocreation.\u201d The Legislature may rationally limit marriage to opposite-sex couples, he concluded, because those couples are \u201ctheoretically . . . capable of procreation,\u201d they do not rely on \u201cinherently more cumbersome\u201d noncoital means of reproduction, and they are more likely than same-sex couples to have children, or more children.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">After the complaint was dismissed and summary judgment entered for the defendants, the plaintiffs appealed. Both parties requested direct appellate review, which we granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">Although the plaintiffs refer in passing to \u201cthe marriage statutes,\u201d they focus, quite properly, on G. L. c. 207, the marriage licensing statute, which controls entry into civil marriage. As a preliminary matter, we summarize the provisions of that law.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-9\">General Laws c. 207 is both a gatekeeping and a public records statute. It sets minimum qualifications for obtaining a marriage license and directs city and town clerks, the registrar, and the department to keep and maintain certain \u201cvital records\u201d of civil marriages. The gatekeeping provisions of G. L. c. 207 are minimal. They forbid marriage of individuals within certain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>degrees of consanguinity, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2, and polygamous marriages. See G. L. c. 207, \u00a7 4. See also G. L. c. 207, \u00a7 8 (marriages solemnized in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2, and 4, are void ab initia). They prohibit marriage if one of the parties has communicable syphilis, see G. L. c. 207, \u00a7 28A, and restrict the circumstances in which a person under eighteen years of age may marry. See G. L. c. 207, \u00a7\u00a7 7, 25, and 27. The statute requires that civil marriage be solemnized only by those so authorized. See G. L. c. 207, \u00a7\u00a7 38-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">The record-keeping provisions of G. L. c. 207 are more extensive. Marriage applicants file standard information forms and a medical certificate in any Massachusetts city or town clerk\u2019s office and tender a filing fee. G. L. c. 207, \u00a7\u00a7 19-20, 28A. The clerk issues the marriage license, and when the marriage is solemnized, the individual authorized to solemnize the marriage adds additional information to the form and returns it (or a copy) to the clerk\u2019s office. G. L. c. 207, \u00a7\u00a7 28, 30, 38-40 (this completed form is commonly known as the \u201cmarriage certificate\u201d). The clerk sends a copy of the information to the registrar, and that information becomes a public record. See G. L. c. 17, \u00a7 4; G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>\u2019<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">In short, for all the joy and solemnity that normally attend a marriage, G. L. c. 207, governing entrance to marriage, is a licensing law. The plaintiffs argue that because nothing in that licensing law specifically prohibits marriages between persons of the same sex, we may interpret the statute to permit \u201cqualified same sex couples\u201d to obtain marriage licenses, thereby avoiding the question whether the law is constitutional. See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number><em>School Comm. of Greenfield </em>v. <em>Greenfield Educ. Ass\u2019n, </em>385 Mass. 70, 79 (1982), and cases cited. This claim lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">We interpret statutes to carry out the Legislature\u2019s intent, determined by the words of a statute interpreted according to \u201cthe ordinary and approved usage of the language.\u201d <em>Hanlon </em>v. <em>Rollins, </em>286 Mass. 444, 447 (1934). The everyday meaning of \u201cmarriage\u201d is \u201c[t]he legal union of a man and woman as husband and wife,\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 986 (7th ed. 1999), and the plaintiffs do not argue that the term \u201cmarriage\u201d has ever had a different meaning under Massachusetts law. See, e.g., <em>Milford </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>7 Mass. 48, 52 (1810) (marriage \u201cis an engagement, by which a single man and a single woman, of sufficient discretion, take each other for husband and wife\u201d). This definition of marriage, as both the department and the Superior Court judge point out, derives from the common law. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Knowlton, </em>2 Mass. 530, 535 (1807) (Massachusetts common law derives from English common law except as otherwise altered by Massachusetts statutes and Constitution). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lane, </em>113 Mass. 458, 462-463 (1873) (\u201cwhen the statutes are silent, questions of the validity of marriages are to be determined by the jus gentium, the common law of nations\u201d); C.P. Kindregan, Jr., &amp; M.L. Inker, Family Law and Practice \u00a7 1.2 (3d ed. 2002). Far from being ambiguous, the undefined word \u201cmarriage,\u201d as used in G. L. c. 207, confirms the General Court\u2019s intent to hew to the term\u2019s common-law and quotidian meaning concerning the genders of the marriage partners.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">The intended scope of G. L. c. 207 is also evident in its consanguinity provisions. See <em>Chandler </em>v. <em>County Comm\u2019rs of Nantucket County, </em>437 Mass. 430, 435 (2002) (statute\u2019s various provisions may offer insight into legislative intent). Sections 1 and 2 of G. L. c. 207 prohibit marriages between a man and certain female relatives and a woman and certain male relatives, but are silent as to the consanguinity of male-male or female-female marriage applicants. See G. L. c. 207, \u00a7\u00a7 1-2. The only reasonable explanation is that the Legislature did not intend that same-sex couples be licensed to marry. We conclude, as did the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>judge, that G. L. c. 207 may not be construed to permit same-sex couples to marry.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">in</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">The larger question is whether, as the department claims, government action that bars same-sex couples from civil marriage constitutes a legitimate exercise of the State\u2019s authority to regulate conduct, or whether, as the plaintiffs claim, this categorical marriage exclusion violates the Massachusetts Constitution. We have recognized the long-standing statutory understanding, derived from the common law, that \u201cmarriage\u201d means the lawful union of a woman and a man. But that history cannot and does not foreclose the constitutional question.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">The plaintiffs\u2019 claim that the marriage restriction violates the Massachusetts Constitution can be analyzed in two ways. Does it offend the Constitution\u2019s guarantees of equality before the law? Or do the liberty and due process provisions of the Massachusetts Constitution secure the plaintiffs\u2019 right to marry their chosen partner? In matters implicating marriage, family life, and the upbringing of children, the two constitutional concepts frequently overlap, as they do here. See, e.g., <em>M.L.B. </em>v. <em>S.L.J., </em>519 U.S. 102, 120 (1996) (noting convergence of due process and equal protection principles in cases concerning parent-child relationships); <em>Perez </em>v. <em>Sharp, 32 </em>Cal. 2d 711, 728 (1948) (analyzing statutory ban on interracial marriage as equal protection violation concerning regulation of fundamental right). See also <em>Lawrence, supra </em>at 2482 (\u201cEquality of treatment and the due process right to demand respect for conduct protected by the substantive guarantee of liberty are linked in important respects, and a decision on the latter point advances both interests\u201d); <em>Bolling </em>v. <em>Sharpe, </em>347 U.S. 497 (1954) (racial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>segregation in District of Columbia public schools violates the due process clause of Fifth Amendment to United States Constitution), decided the same day as <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Board of Educ. of </em>Topeka, 347 U.S. 483 (1954) (holding that segregation of public schools in States violates equal protection clause of Fourteenth Amendment). Much of what we say concerning one standard applies to the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">We begin by considering the nature of civil marriage itself. Simply put, the government creates civil marriage. In Massachusetts, civil marriage is, and since pre-Colonial days has been, precisely what its name implies: a wholly secular institution. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Munson, </em>127 Mass. 459, 460-466 (1879) (noting that \u201c[i]n Massachusetts, from very early times, the requisites of a valid marriage have been regulated by statutes of the Colony, Province, and Commonwealth,\u201d and surveying marriage statutes from 1639 through 1834). No religious ceremony has ever been required to validate a Massachusetts marriage. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">In a real sense, there are three partners to every civil marriage: two willing spouses and an approving State. See <em>DeMatteo </em>v. <em>DeMatteo, </em>436 Mass. 18, 31 (2002) (\u201cMarriage is not a mere contract between two parties but a legal status from which certain rights and obligations arise\u201d); <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>171 Mass. 404, 409 (1898) (on marriage, the parties \u201cassume[] new relations to each other and to the State\u201d). See also <em>French </em>v. <em>McAnarney, </em>290 Mass. 544, 546 (1935). While only the parties can mutually assent to marriage, the terms of the marriage \u2014 who may marry and what obligations, benefits, and liabilities attach to civil marriage \u2014 are set by the Commonwealth. Conversely, while only the parties can agree to end the marriage (absent the death of one of them or a marriage void ab initia), the Commonwealth defines the exit terms. See G. L. c. 208.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">Civil marriage is created and regulated through exercise of the police power. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stowell, </em>389 Mass. 171, 175 (1983) (regulation of marriage is properly within the scope of the police power). \u201cPolice power\u201d (now more commonly termed the State\u2019s regulatory authority) is an old-fashioned term for the Commonwealth\u2019s lawmaking authority, as bounded by the liberty and equality guarantees of the Mas<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>sachusetts Constitution and its express delegation of power from the people to their government. In broad terms, it is the Legislature\u2019s power to enact rules to regulate conduct, to the extent that such laws are \u201cnecessary to secure the health, safety, good order, comfort, or general welfare of the community\u201d (citations omitted). <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>341 Mass. 760, 785 (1960).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Alger, </em>7 Cush. 53, 85 (1851).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">Without question, civil marriage enhances the \u201cwelfare of the community.\u201d It is a \u201csocial institution of the highest importance.\u201d <em>French </em>v. <em>McAnarney, supra. </em>Civil marriage anchors an ordered society by encouraging stable relationships over transient ones. It is central to the way the Commonwealth identifies individuals, provides for the orderly distribution of property, ensures that children and adults are cared for and supported whenever possible from private rather than public funds, and tracks important epidemiological and demographic data.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">Marriage also bestows enormous private and social advantages on those who choose to marry. Civil marriage is at once a deeply personal commitment to another human being and a highly public celebration of the ideals of mutuality, companionship, intimacy, fidelity, and family. \u201cIt is an association that promotes a way of life, not causes; a harmony in living, not political faiths; a bilateral loyalty, not commercial or social projects.\u201d <em>Griswold </em>v. <em>Connecticut, </em>381 U.S. 479, 486 (1965). Because it fulfils yearnings for security, safe haven, and connection that express our common humanity, civil marriage is an esteemed institution, and the decision whether and whom to marry is among life\u2019s momentous acts of self-definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">Tangible as well as intangible benefits flow from marriage. The marriage license grants valuable property rights to those who meet the entry requirements, and who agree to what might otherwise be a burdensome degree of government regulation of their activities.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> See <em>Leduc </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>421 Mass. 433, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>435 (1995), cert, denied, 519 U.S. 827 (1996) (\u201cThe historical aim of licensure generally is preservation of public health, safety, and welfare by extending the public trust only to those with proven qualifications\u201d). The Legislature has conferred on \u201ceach party [in a civil marriage] substantial rights concerning the assets of the other which unmarried cohabitants do not have.\u201d <em>Wilcox </em>v. <em>Trautz, </em>427 Mass. 326, 334 (1998). See <em>Collins </em>v. <em>Guggenheim, </em>417 Mass. 615, 618 (1994) (rejecting claim for equitable distribution of property where plaintiff cohabited with but did not marry defendant); <em>Feliciano </em>v. <em>Rosemar Silver Co., </em>401 Mass. 141, 142 (1987) (government interest in promoting marriage would be \u201csubverted\u201d by recognition of \u201ca right to recover for loss of consortium by a person who has not accepted the correlative responsibilities of marriage\u201d); <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Misiono, </em>373 Mass. 261, 263 (1977) (unmarried partners not entitled to rights of separate support or alimony). See generally <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Desilets, </em>418 Mass. 316, 327-328 &amp; nn.10, 11 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">The benefits accessible only by way of a marriage license are enormous, touching nearly every aspect of life and death. The department states that \u201chundreds of statutes\u201d are related to marriage and to marital benefits. With no attempt to be comprehensive, we note that some of the statutory benefits conferred by the Legislature on those who enter into civil marriage include, as to property: joint Massachusetts income tax filing (G. L. c. 62C, \u00a7 6); tenancy by the entirety (a form of ownership that provides certain protections against creditors and allows for the automatic descent of property to the surviving spouse without probate) (G. L. c. 184, \u00a7 7); extension of the benefit of the homestead protection (securing up to $300,000 in equity from creditors) to one\u2019s spouse and children (G. L. c. 188, \u00a7 1); automatic rights to inherit the property of a deceased spouse who does not leave a will (G. L. c. 190, \u00a7 1); the rights of elective share and of dower (which allow surviving spouses certain property rights where the decedent spouse has not made adequate provision for the survivor in a will) (G. L. c. 191, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>\u00a7 15, and G. L. c. 189); entitlement to wages owed to a deceased employee (G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 178A [general] and G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 178C [public employees]); eligibility to continue certain businesses of a deceased spouse (e.g., G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 53 [dentist]); the right to share the medical policy of one\u2019s spouse (e.g., G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 108, Second [a] [3] [defining insured\u2019s \u201cdependent\u201d to include one\u2019s spouse), see <em>Connors </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>430 Mass. 31, 43 (1999) [domestic partners of city employees not included within term \u201cdependent\u201d as used in G. L. c. 32B, \u00a7 2]); thirty-nine week continuation of health coverage for the spouse of a person who is laid off or dies (e.g., G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 110G); preferential options under the Commonwealth\u2019s pension system (see G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 12 [2] [\u201cJoint and Last Survivor Allowance\u201d]); preferential benefits in the Commonwealth\u2019s medical program, MassHealth (e.g., 130 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 515.012 [A], prohibiting placing lien on long-term care patient\u2019s former home if spouse still lives there); access to veterans\u2019 spousal benefits and preferences (e.g., G. L. c. 115, \u00a7 1 [defining \u201cdependents\u201d] and G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 26 [State employment] and \u00a7 28 [municipal employees]); financial protections for spouses of certain Commonwealth employees (fire fighters, police officers, and prosecutors, among others) killed in the performance of duty (e.g., G. L. c. 32, \u00a7\u00a7 100-103); the equitable division of marital property on divorce (G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 34); temporary and permanent alimony rights (G. L. c. 208, \u00a7\u00a7 17 and 34); the right to separate support on separation of the parties that does not result in divorce (G. L. c. 209, \u00a7 32); and the right to bring claims for wrongful death and loss of consortium, and for funeral and burial expenses and punitive damages resulting from tort actions (G. L. c. 229, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2; G. L. c. 228, \u00a7 1. See <em>Feliciano </em>v. <em>Rosemar Silver Co., supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">Exclusive marital benefits that are not directly tied to property rights include the presumptions of legitimacy and parentage of children bom to a married couple (G. L. c. 209C, \u00a7 6, and G. L. c. 46, \u00a7 4B); and evidentiary rights, such as the prohibition against spouses testifying against one another about their private conversations, applicable in both civil and criminal cases (G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20). Other statutory benefits of a personal nature available only to married individuals include qualification for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>bereavement or medical leave to care for individuals related by blood or marriage (G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 52D); an automatic \u201cfamily member\u201d preference to make medical decisions for an incompetent or disabled spouse who does not have a contrary health care proxy, see <em>Shine </em>v. <em>Vega, </em>429 Mass. 456, 466 (1999); the application of predictable rules of child custody, visitation, support, and removal out-of-State when married parents divorce (e.g., G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 19 [temporary custody], \u00a7 20 [temporary support], \u00a7 28 [custody and support on judgment of divorce], \u00a7 30 [removal from Commonwealth], and \u00a7 31 [shared custody plan]; priority rights to administer the estate of a deceased spouse who dies without a will, and the requirement that a surviving spouse must consent to the appointment of any other person as administrator (G. L. c. 38, \u00a7 13 [disposition of body], and G. L. c. 113, \u00a7 8 [anatomical gifts]); and the right to interment in the lot or tomb owned by one\u2019s deceased spouse (G. L. c. 114, \u00a7\u00a7 29-33).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">Where a married couple has children, their children are also directly or indirectly, but no less auspiciously, the recipients of the special legal and economic protections obtained by civil marriage. Notwithstanding the Commonwealth\u2019s strong public policy to abolish legal distinctions between marital and non-marital children in providing for the support and care of minors, see <em>Department of Revenue </em>v. <em>Mason M., </em>439 Mass. 665 (2003); <em>Woodward </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Social Sec., </em>435 Mass. 536, 546 (2002), the fact remains that marital children reap a measure of family stability and economic security based on their parents\u2019 legally privileged status that is largely inaccessible, or not as readily accessible, to nonmarital children. Some of these benefits are social, such as the enhanced approval that still attends the status of being a marital child. Others are material, such as the greater ease of access to family-based State and Federal benefits that attend the presumptions of one\u2019s parentage.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">It is undoubtedly for these concrete reasons, as well as for its intimately personal significance, that civil marriage has long been termed a \u201ccivil right.\u201d See, e.g., <em>Loving </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>388 U.S. 1, 12 (1967) (\u201cMarriage is one of the \u2018basic civil rights of man,\u2019 fundamental to our very existence and survival\u201d), quoting <em>Skinner </em>v. <em>Oklahoma, </em>316 U.S. 535, 541 (1942); <em>Milford </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number><em>Worcester, </em>7 Mass. 48, 56 (1810) (referring to \u201ccivil rights incident to marriages\u201d). See also <em>Baehr </em>v. <em>Lewin, </em>74 Haw. 530, 561 (1993) (identifying marriage as \u201ccivil right[ ]\u201d); <em>Baker </em>v. <em>State, </em>170 Vt. 194, 242 (1999) (Johnson, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (same). The United States Supreme Court has described the right to marry as \u201cof fundamental importance for all individuals\u201d and as \u201cpart of the fundamental \u2018right of privacy\u2019 implicit in the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause.\u201d <em>Zablocki </em>v. <em>Redhail, </em>434 U.S. 374, 384 (1978). See <em>Loving </em>v. <em>Virginia, supra </em>(\u201cThe freedom to marry has long been recognized as one of the vital personal rights essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness by free men\u201d).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">Without the right to marry \u2014 or more properly, the right to choose to marry \u2014 one is excluded from the full range of human experience and denied full protection of the laws for one\u2019s \u201cavowed commitment to an intimate and lasting human relationship.\u201d <em>Baker </em>v. <em>State, supra </em>at 229. Because civil marriage is central to the lives of individuals and the welfare of the community, our laws assiduously protect the individual\u2019s right to marry against undue government incursion. Laws may not \u201cinterfere directly and substantially with the right to marry.\u201d <em>Zablocki </em>v. <em>Redhail, supra </em>at 387. See <em>Perez </em>v. <em>Sharp, </em>32 Cal. 2d 711, 714 (1948) (\u201cThere can be no prohibition of marriage except for an important social objective and reasonable means\u201d).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">Unquestionably, the regulatory power of the Commonwealth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>over civil marriage is broad, as is the Commonwealth\u2019s discretion to award public benefits. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stowell, </em>389 Mass. 171, 175 (1983) (marriage); <em>Moe </em>v. <em>Secretary of Admin. &amp; Fin., </em>382 Mass. 629, 652 (1981) (Medicaid benefits). Individuals who have the choice to marry each other and nevertheless choose not to may properly be denied the legal benefits of marriage. See <em>Wilcox </em>v. <em>Trautz, 427 </em>Mass. 326, 334 (1998); <em>Collins </em>v. <em>Guggenheim, </em>417 Mass. 615, 618 (1994); <em>Feliciano </em>v. <em>Rosemar Silver Co., </em>401 Mass. 141, 142 (1987). But that same logic cannot hold for a qualified individual who would marry if she or he only could.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">For decades, indeed centuries, in much of this country (including Massachusetts) no lawful marriage was possible between white and black Americans. That long history availed not when the Supreme Court of California held in 1948 that a legislative prohibition against interracial marriage violated the due process and equality guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment, <em>Perez </em>v. <em>Sharp, </em>32 Cal. 2d 711, 728 (1948), or when, nineteen years later, the United States Supreme Court also held that a statutory bar to interracial marriage violated the Fourteenth Amendment, <em>Loving </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>388 U.S. 1 (1967).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> As both <em>Perez </em>and <em>Loving </em>make clear, the right to marry means <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>little if it does not include the right to marry the person of one\u2019s choice, subject to appropriate government restrictions in the interests of public health, safety, and welfare. See <em>Perez </em>v. <em>Sharp, supra </em>at 717 (\u201cthe essence of the right to marry is freedom to join in marriage with the person of one\u2019s choice\u201d). See also <em>Loving </em>v. <em>Virginia, supra </em>at 12. In this case, as in <em>Perez </em>and <em>Loving, </em>a statute deprives individuals of access to an institution of fundamental legal, personal, and social significance \u2014 the institution of marriage \u2014 because of a single trait: skin color in <em>Perez </em>and <em>Loving, </em>sexual orientation here. As it did in <em>Perez </em>and <em>Loving, </em>history must yield to a more fully developed understanding of the invidious quality of the discrimination.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">The Massachusetts Constitution protects matters of personal liberty against government incursion as zealously, and often more so, than does the Federal Constitution, even where both Constitutions employ essentially the same language. See <em>Planned Parenthood League of Mass., Inc. </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>424 Mass. 586, 590 (1997); <em>Corning Glass Works </em>v. <em>Ann &amp; Hope, Inc. of Danvers, </em>363 Mass. 409, 416 (1973). That the Massachusetts Constitution is in some instances more protective of individual liberty interests than is the Federal Constitution is not surprising. Fundamental to the vigor of our Federal system of government is that \u201cstate courts are absolutely free to interpret state constitutional provisions to accord greater protection to individual rights than do similar provisions of the United States Constitution.\u201d <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>514 U.S. 1, 8 (1995).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">The individual liberty and equality safeguards of the Mas<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>sachusetts Constitution protect both \u201cfreedom from\u201d unwarranted government intrusion into protected spheres of life and \u201cfreedom to\u201d partake in benefits created by the State for the common good. See <em>Bachrach </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, </em>382 Mass. 268, 273 (1981); <em>Dalli </em>v. <em>Board of Educ., </em>358 Mass. 753, 759 (1971). Both freedoms are involved here. Whether and whom to marry, how to express sexual intimacy, and whether and how to establish a family \u2014 these are among the most basic of every individual\u2019s liberty and due process rights. See, e.g., <em>Lawrence, supra </em>at 2481; <em>Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. </em>v. <em>Casey, </em>505 U.S. 833, 851 (1992); <em>Zablocki </em>v. <em>Redhail, </em>434 U.S. 374, 384 (1978); <em>Roe </em>v. <em>Wade, </em>410 U.S. 113, 152-153 (1973); <em>Eisenstadt </em>v. <em>Baird, </em>405 U.S. 438, 453 (1972); <em>Loving </em>v. <em>Virginia, supra. </em>And central to personal freedom and security is the assurance that the laws will apply equally to persons in similar situations. \u201cAbsolute equality before the law is a fundamental principle of our own Constitution.\u201d <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>211 Mass. 618, 619 (1912). The liberty interest in choosing whether and whom to marry would be hollow if the Commonwealth could, without sufficient justification, foreclose an individual from freely choosing the person with whom to share an exclusive commitment in the unique institution of civil marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">The Massachusetts Constitution requires, at a minimum, that the exercise of the State\u2019s regulatory authority not be \u201carbitrary or capricious.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Henry\u2019s Drywall Co., </em>366 Mass. 539, 542 (1974).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Under both the equality and liberty guarantees, regulatory authority must, at very least, serve \u201ca <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>legitimate purpose in a rational way\u201d; a statute must \u201cbear a reasonable relation to a permissible legislative objective.\u201d <em>Rushworth </em>v. <em>Registrar of Motor Vehicles, </em>413 Mass. 265, 270 (1992). See, e.g., <em>Massachusetts Fed\u2019n of Teachers </em>v. <em>Board of Educ., </em>436 Mass. 763, 778 (2002) (equal protection); <em>Coffee-Rich, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Health, </em>348 Mass. 414, 422 (1965) (due process). Any law failing to satisfy the basic standards of rationality is void.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">The plaintiffs challenge the marriage statute on both equal protection and due process grounds. With respect to each such claim, we must first determine the appropriate standard of review. Where a statute implicates a fundamental right or uses a suspect classification, we employ \u201cstrict judicial scrutiny.\u201d <em>Lowell </em>v. <em>Kowalski, </em>380 Mass. 663, 666 (1980). For all other statutes, we employ the \u201c \u2018rational basis\u2019 test.\u201d <em>English </em>v. <em>New England Med. Ctr., </em>405 Mass. 423, 428 (1989). For due process claims, rational basis analysis requires that statutes \u201cbear[] a real and substantial relation to the public health, safety, morals, or some other phase of the general welfare.\u201d <em>Coffee-Rich, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Health, supra, </em>quoting <em>Sperry &amp; Hutchinson Co. </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. on the Necessaries of Life, </em>307 Mass. 408, 418 (1940). For equal protection challenges, the rational basis test requires that \u201can impartial lawmaker could logically believe that the classification would serve a legitimate public purpose that transcends the harm to the members of the disadvantaged class.\u201d <em>English </em>v. <em>New England Med. Ctr., supra </em>at 429, quoting <em>Cleburne </em>v. <em>Cleburne Living Ctr., Inc., </em>473 U.S. 432, 452 (1985) (Stevens, J., concurring).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">The department argues that no fundamental right or \u201csuspect\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>class is at issue here,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> and rational basis is the appropriate standard of review. For the reasons we explain below, we conclude that the marriage ban does not meet the rational basis test for either due process or equal protection. Because the statute does not survive rational basis review, we do not consider the plaintiffs\u2019 arguments that this case merits strict judicial scrutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">The department posits three legislative rationales for prohibiting same-sex couples from marrying: (1) providing a \u201cfavorable setting for procreation\u201d; (2) ensuring the optimal setting for child rearing, which the department defines as \u201ca two-parent family with one parent of each sex\u201d; and (3) preserving scarce State and private financial resources. We consider each in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">The judge in the Superior Court endorsed the first rationale, holding that \u201cthe state\u2019s interest in regulating marriage is based on the traditional concept that marriage\u2019s primary purpose is procreation.\u201d This is incorrect. Our laws of civil marriage do not privilege procreative heterosexual intercourse between married people above every other form of adult intimacy and every other means of creating a family. General Laws c. 207 contains no requirement that the applicants for a marriage license attest to their ability or intention to conceive children by coitus. Fertility is not a condition of marriage, nor is it grounds for divorce. People who have never consummated their marriage, and never plan to, may be and stay married. See <em>Franklin </em>v. <em>Franklin, </em>154 Mass. 515, 516 (1891) (\u201cThe consummation of a marriage by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>coition is not necessary to its validity\u201d).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> People who cannot stir from their deathbed may marry. See G. L. c. 207, \u00a7 28A. While it is certainly true that many, perhaps most, married couples have children together (assisted or unassisted), it is the exclusive and permanent commitment of the marriage partners to one another, not the begetting of children, that is the sine qua non of civil marriage.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">Moreover, the Commonwealth affirmatively facilitates bringing children into a family regardless of whether the intended parent is married or unmarried, whether the child is adopted or bom into a family, whether assistive technology was used to conceive the child, and whether the parent or her partner is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>heterosexual, homosexual, or bisexual.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> If procreation were a necessary component of civil marriage, our statutes would draw a tighter circle around the permissible bounds of nonmarital child bearing and the creation of families by noncoital means. The attempt to isolate procreation as \u201cthe source of a fundamental right to marry,\u201d <em>post </em>at 370 (Cordy, J., dissenting), overlooks the integrated way in which courts have examined the complex and overlapping realms of personal autonomy, marriage, family life, and child rearing. Our jurisprudence recognizes that, in these nuanced and fundamentally private areas of life, such a narrow focus is inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">The \u201cmarriage is procreation\u201d argument singles out the one unbridgeable difference between same-sex and opposite-sex couples, and transforms that difference into the essence of legal marriage. Like \u201cAmendment 2\u201d to the Constitution of Colorado, which effectively denied homosexual persons equality under the law and full access to the political process, the marriage restriction impermissibly \u201cidentifies persons by a single trait and then denies them protection across the board.\u201d <em>Romer </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>517 U.S. 620, 633 (1996). In so doing, the State\u2019s action confers an official stamp of approval on the destructive stereotype that same-sex relationships are inherently unstable and inferior to opposite-sex relationships and are not worthy of respect.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">The department\u2019s first stated rationale, equating marriage with unassisted heterosexual procreation, shades imperceptibly into its second: that confining marriage to opposite-sex couples ensures that children are raised in the \u201coptimal\u201d setting. Protect<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>ing the welfare of children is a paramount State policy. Restricting marriage to opposite-sex couples, however, cannot plausibly further this policy. \u201cThe demographic changes of the past century make it difficult to speak of an average American family. The composition of families varies greatly from household to household.\u201d <em>Troxel </em>v. <em>Granville, </em>530 U.S. 57, 63 (2000). Massachusetts has responded supportively to \u201cthe changing realities of the American family,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 64, and has moved vigorously to strengthen the modem family in its many variations. See, e.g., G. L. c. 209C (paternity statute); G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 39D (grandparent visitation statute); <em>Blixt </em>v. <em>Blixt, </em>437 Mass. 649 (2002), cert, denied, 537 U.S. 1189 (2003) (same); <em>E.N.O. </em>v. <em>L.M.M., </em>429 Mass. 824, cert, denied, 528 U.S. 1005 (1999) (de facto parent); <em>Youmans </em>v. <em>Ramos, </em>429 Mass. 774, 782 (1999) (same); and <em>Adoption of Tammy, </em>416 Mass. 205 (1993) (coparent adoption). Moreover, we have repudiated the common-law power of the State to provide varying levels of protection to children based on the circumstances of birth. See G. L. c. 209C (paternity statute); <em>Powers </em>v. <em>Wilkinson, </em>399 Mass. 650, 661 (1987) (\u201cOurs is an era in which logic and compassion have impelled the law toward unburdening children from the stigma and the disadvantages heretofore attendant upon the status of illegitimacy\u201d). The \u201cbest interests of the child\u201d standard does not turn on a parent\u2019s sexual orientation or marital status. See e.g., <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Doe, </em>16 Mass. App. Ct. 499, 503 (1983) (parent\u2019s sexual orientation insufficient ground to deny custody of child in divorce action). See also <em>E.N.O. </em>v. <em>L.M.M., supra </em>at 829-830 (best interests of child determined by considering child\u2019s relationship with biological and de facto same-sex parents); <em>Silvia </em>v. <em>Silvia, 9 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 339, 341 &amp; n.3 (1980) (collecting support and custody statutes containing no gender distinction).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">The department has offered no evidence that forbidding marriage to people of the same sex will increase the number of couples choosing to enter into opposite-sex marriages in order to have and raise children. There is thus no rational relationship between the marriage statute and the Commonwealth\u2019s proffered goal of protecting the \u201coptimal\u201d child rearing unit. Moreover, the department readily concedes that people in same-sex couples may be \u201cexcellent\u201d parents. These couples (includ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>ing four of the plaintiff couples) have children for the reasons others do \u2014 to love them, to care for them, to nurture them. But the task of child rearing for same-sex couples is made infinitely harder by their status as outliers to the marriage laws. While establishing the parentage of children as soon as possible is crucial to the safety and welfare of children, see <em>Culliton </em>v. <em>Beth Israel Deaconness Med. Ctr., </em>435 Mass. 285, 292 (2001), same-sex couples must undergo the sometimes lengthy and intrusive process of second-parent adoption to establish their joint parentage. While the enhanced income provided by marital benefits is an important source of security and stability for married couples and their children, those benefits are denied to families headed by same-sex couples. See, e.g., note 6, <em>supra. </em>While the laws of divorce provide clear and reasonably predictable guidelines for child support, child custody, and property division on dissolution of a marriage, same-sex couples who dissolve their relationships find themselves and their children in the highly unpredictable terrain of equity jurisdiction. See <em>E.N.O. </em>v. <em>L.M.M., supra. </em>Given the wide range of public benefits reserved only for married couples, we do not credit the department\u2019s contention that the absence of access to civil marriage amounts to little more than an inconvenience to same-sex couples and their children. Excluding same-sex couples from civil marriage will not make children of opposite-sex marriages more secure, but it does prevent children of same-sex couples from enjoying the immeasurable advantages that flow from the assurance of \u201ca stable family structure in which children will be reared, educated, and socialized.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 381 (Cordy, J., dissenting).<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">No one disputes that the plaintiff couples are families, that many are parents, and that the children they are raising, like all children, need and should have the fullest opportunity to grow up in a secure, protected family unit. Similarly, no one disputes that, under the rubric of marriage, the State provides a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>cornucopia of substantial benefits to married parents and their children. The preferential treatment of civil marriage reflects the Legislature\u2019s conclusion that marriage \u201cis the foremost setting for the education and socialization of children\u201d precisely because it \u201cencourages parents to remain committed to each other and to their children as they grow.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 383 (Cordy, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">In this case, we are confronted with an entire, sizeable class of parents raising children who have absolutely no access to civil marriage and its protections because they are forbidden from procuring a marriage license. It cannot be rational under our laws, and indeed it is not permitted, to penalize children by depriving them of State benefits because the State disapproves of their parents\u2019 sexual orientation.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">The third rationale advanced by the department is that limiting marriage to opposite-sex couples furthers the Legislature\u2019s interest in conserving scarce State and private financial resources. The marriage restriction is rational, it argues, because the General Court logically could assume that same-sex couples are more financially independent than married couples and thus less needy of public marital benefits, such as tax advantages, or private marital benefits, such as employer-financed health plans that include spouses in their coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">An absolute statutory ban on same-sex marriage bears no rational relationship to the goal of economy. First, the department\u2019s conclusory generalization \u2014 that same-sex couples are less financially dependent on each other than opposite-sex couples \u2014 ignores that many same-sex couples, such as many of the plaintiffs in this case, have children and other dependents (here, aged parents) in their care.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The department does not contend, nor could it, that these dependents are less needy or deserving than the dependents of married couples. Second, Massachusetts marriage laws do not condition receipt of public and private financial benefits to married individuals on a demonstration of financial dependence on each other; the benefits are available to married couples regardless of whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>they mingle their finances or actually depend on each other for support.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">The department suggests additional rationales for prohibiting same-sex couples from marrying, which are developed by some amici. It argues that broadening civil marriage to include same-sex couples will trivialize or destroy the institution of marriage as it has historically been fashioned. Certainly our decision today marks a significant change in the definition of marriage as it has been inherited from the common law, and understood by many societies for centuries. But it does not disturb the fundamental value of marriage in our society.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">Here, the plaintiffs seek only to be married, not to undermine the institution of civil marriage. They do not want marriage abolished. They do not attack the binary nature of marriage, the consanguinity provisions, or any of the other gate-keeping provisions of the marriage licensing law. Recognizing the right of an individual to marry a person of the same sex will not diminish the validity or dignity of opposite-sex marriage, any more than recognizing the right of an individual to marry a person of a different race devalues the marriage of a person who marries someone of her own race.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> If anything, extending civil marriage to same-sex couples reinforces the importance of marriage to individuals and communities. That same-sex couples are willing to embrace marriage\u2019s solemn obligations of exclusivity, mutual support, and commitment to one another is a testament to the enduring place of marriage in our laws and in the human spirit.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">It has been argued that, due to the State\u2019s strong interest in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>the institution of marriage as a stabilizing social structure, only the Legislature can control and define its boundaries. Accordingly, our elected representatives legitimately may choose to exclude same-sex couples from civil marriage in order to assure all citizens of the Commonwealth that (1) the benefits of our marriage laws are available explicitly to create and support a family setting that is, in the Legislature\u2019s view, optimal for child rearing, and (2) the State does not endorse gay and lesbian parenthood as the equivalent of being raised by one\u2019s married biological parents.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> These arguments miss the point. The Massachusetts Constitution requires that legislation meet certain criteria and not extend beyond certain limits. It is the function of courts to determine whether these criteria are met and whether these limits are exceeded. In most instances, these limits are defined by whether a rational basis exists to conclude that legislation will bring about a rational result. The Legislature in the first instance, and the courts in the last instance, must ascertain whether such a rational basis exists. To label the court\u2019s role as usurping that of the Legislature, see, e.g., <em>post </em>at 394-395 (Cordy, J., dissenting), is to misunderstand the nature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>and purpose of judicial review. We owe great deference to the Legislature to decide social and policy issues, but it is the traditional and settled role of courts to decide constitutional issues.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">The history of constitutional law \u201cis the story of the extension of constitutional rights and protections to people once ignored or excluded.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 557 (1996) (construing equal protection clause of Fourteenth Amendment to prohibit categorical exclusion of women from public military institute). This statement is as true in the area of civil marriage as in any other area of civil rights. See, e.g., <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Safley, </em>482 U.S. 78 (1987); <em>Loving </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>388 U.S. 1 (1967); <em>Perez </em>v. <em>Sharp, </em>32 Cal. 2d 711 (1948). As a public institution and a right of fundamental importance, civil marriage is an evolving paradigm. The common law was exceptionally harsh toward women who became wives: a woman\u2019s legal identity all but evaporated into that of her husband. See generally C.P. Kindregan, Jr., &amp; M.L. Inker, Family Law and Practice \u00a7\u00a7 1.9 and 1.10 (3d ed. 2002). Thus, one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>early Nineteenth Century jurist could observe matter of factly that, prior to the abolition of slavery in Massachusetts, \u201cthe condition of a slave resembled the connection of a wife with her husband, and of infant children with their father. He is obliged to maintain them, and they cannot be separated from him.\u201d <em>Winchendon </em>v. Hatfield, 4 Mass. 123, 129 (1808). But since at least the middle of the Nineteenth Century, both the courts and the Legislature have acted to ameliorate the harshness of the common-law regime. In <em>Bradford </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>184 Mass. 557, 562 (1904), we refused to apply the common-law rule that the wife\u2019s legal residence was that of her husband to defeat her claim to a municipal \u201csettlement of paupers.\u201d In <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>370 Mass. 619, 629 (1976), we abrogated the common-law doctrine immunizing a husband against certain suits because the common-law rule was predicated on \u201cantediluvian assumptions concerning the role and status of women in marriage and in society.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 621. Alarms about the imminent erosion of the \u201cnatural\u201d order of marriage were sounded over the demise of antimiscegenation laws, the expansion of the rights of married women, and the introduction of \u201cno-fault\u201d divorce.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Marriage has survived all of these transformations, and we have no doubt that marriage will continue to be a vibrant and revered institution.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">We also reject the argument suggested by the department, and elaborated by some amici, that expanding the institution of civil marriage in Massachusetts to include same-sex couples will lead to interstate conflict. We would not presume to dictate how another State should respond to today\u2019s decision. But neither should considerations of comity prevent us from according Massachusetts residents the full measure of protection available under the Massachusetts Constitution. The genius of our Federal system is that each State\u2019s Constitution has vitality specific to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>its own traditions, and that, subject to the minimum requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment, each State is free to address difficult issues of individual liberty in the manner its own Constitution demands.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">Several amici suggest that prohibiting marriage by same-sex couples reflects community consensus that homosexual conduct is immoral. Yet Massachusetts has a strong affirmative policy of preventing discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. See G. L. c. 15IB (employment, housing, credit, services); G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 39 (hate crimes); G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 98 (public accommodation); G. L. c. 76, \u00a7 5 (public education). See also, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Balthazar, </em>366 Mass. 298 (1974) (decriminalization of private consensual adult conduct); <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Doe, </em>16 Mass. App. Ct. 499, 503 (1983) (custody to homosexual parent not per se prohibited).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">The department has had more than ample opportunity to articulate a constitutionally adequate justification for limiting civil marriage to opposite-sex unions. It has failed to do so. The department has offered purported justifications for the civil marriage restriction that are starkly at odds with the comprehensive network of vigorous, gender-neutral laws promoting stable families and the best interests of children. It has failed to identify any relevant characteristic that would justify shutting the door to civil marriage to a person who wishes to marry someone of the same sex.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">The marriage ban works a deep and scarring hardship on a very real segment of the community for no rational reason. The absence of any reasonable relationship between, on the one hand, an absolute disqualification of same-sex couples who wish to enter into civil marriage and, on the other, protection of public health, safety, or general welfare, suggests that the marriage restriction is rooted in persistent prejudices against persons who are (or who are believed to be) homosexual.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> \u201cThe Constitution cannot control such prejudices but neither can it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>tolerate them. Private biases may be outside the reach of the law, but the law cannot, directly or indirectly, give them effect.\u201d <em>Palmore </em>v. <em>Sidoti, </em>466 U.S. 429, 433 (1984) (construing Fourteenth Amendment). Limiting the protections, benefits, and obligations of civil marriage to opposite-sex couples violates the basic premises of individual liberty and equality under law protected by the Massachusetts Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">We consider next the plaintiffs\u2019 request for relief. We preserve as much of the statute as may be preserved in the face of the successful constitutional challenge. See <em>Mayor of Boston </em>v. <em>Treasurer &amp; Receiver Gen., </em>384 Mass. 718, 725 (1981); <em>Dalli </em>v. <em>Board of Educ., </em>358 Mass. 753, 759 (1971). See also G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 6, Eleventh.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">Here, no one argues that striking down the marriage laws is an appropriate form of relief. Eliminating civil marriage would be wholly inconsistent with the Legislature\u2019s deep commitment to fostering stable families and would dismantle a vital organiz<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>ing principle of our society.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> We face a problem similar to one that recently confronted the Court of Appeal for Ontario, the highest court of that Canadian province, when it considered the constitutionality of the same-sex marriage ban under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (Charter), part of Canada\u2019s Federal Constitution. See <em>Halpern </em>v. <em>Toronto (City), </em>172 O.A.C. 276 (2003). Canada, like the United States, adopted the common law of England that civil marriage is \u201cthe voluntary union for life of one man and one woman, to the exclusion of all others.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at par. (36), quoting <em>Hyde </em>v. <em>Hyde, </em>[1861-1873] All E.R. 175 (1866). In holding that the limitation of civil marriage to opposite-sex couples violated the Charter, the Court of Appeal refined the common-law meaning of marriage. We concur with this remedy, which is entirely consonant with established principles of jurisprudence empowering a court to refine a common-law principle in light of evolving constitutional standards. See <em>Powers </em>v. <em>Wilkinson, </em>399 Mass. 650, 661-662 (1987) (reforming common-law rule of construction of \u201cissue\u201d); <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>370 Mass. 619, 629 (1976) (abolishing common-law rule of certain interspousal immunity).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">We construe civil marriage to mean the voluntary union of two persons as spouses, to the exclusion of all others. This reformulation redresses the plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional injury and furthers the aim of marriage to promote stable, exclusive relationships. It advances the two legitimate State interests the department has identified: providing a stable setting for child rearing and conserving State resources. It leaves intact the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>Legislature\u2019s broad discretion to regulate marriage. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stowell, </em>389 Mass. 171, 175 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">In their complaint the plaintiffs request only a declaration that their exclusion and the exclusion of other qualified same-sex couples from access to civil marriage violates Massachusetts law. We declare that barring an individual from the protections, benefits, and obligations of civil marriage solely because that person would marry a person of the same sex violates the Massachusetts Constitution. We vacate the summary judgment for the department. We remand this case to the Superior Court for entry of judgment consistent with this opinion. Entry of judgment shall be stayed for 180 days to permit the Legislature to take such action as it may deem appropriate in light of this opinion. See, e.g., <em>Michaud </em>v. <em>Sheriff of Essex County, </em>390 Mass. 523, 535-536 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b333-8\">For American appellate courts that have recently addressed this issue, see <em>Standhardt </em>v. <em>Superior Court, 77 </em>P.3d 451 (Ariz.

Since the earliest days of the Commonwealth, the divorce statutes have permitted (but not required) a spouse to choose to divorce his or her impotent mate. See St. 1785, c. 69, \u00a7 3. While infertility is not a ground to void or terminate a marriage, impotency (the inability to engage in sexual intercourse) is, at the election of the disaffected spouse. See G. L. c. 207, \u00a7 14 (annulment); G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 1 (divorce). Cf. <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Otis, </em>233 Mass. 491, 495 (1919) (\u201cimpotency does not render a marriage void, but only voidable at the suit of the party conceiving himself or herself to be wronged\u201d); <em>Smith </em>v.

However, in <em>Hanson </em>v. <em>Hanson, </em>287 Mass. 154 (1934), a decree of annulment for nonconsummation was reversed where the wife knew before the marriage that her husband had syphilis and voluntarily chose to marry him.

Punitive notions of illegitimacy, see <em>Powers </em>v. <em>Wilkinson, 399 </em>Mass. 650, 661 (1987), and of homosexual identity, see <em>Lawrence, supra </em>at 2478-2479, further cemented the common and legal understanding of marriage as an unquestionably heterosexual institution.

See <em>post </em>at 392 (Cordy, 1, dissenting). We give full credit to the Legislature for enacting a statutory scheme of child-related laws that is coherent, consistent, and harmonious.

We are not required to impute an invidious intent to the Legislature in determining that a statute of long standing has no applicability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>to present circumstances or violates the rights of individuals under the Massachusetts Constitution. That the Legislature may have intended what at the time of enactment was a perfectly reasonable form of discrimination \u2014 or a result not recognized as a form of discrimination \u2014 was not enough to salvage from later constitutional challenge laws burdening nonmarital children or denying women\u2019s equal partnership in marriage.

In my view, however, the case is more directly resolved using traditional equal protection analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">(a) Article 1 of the Declaration of Rights, as amended by art. 106 of the Amendments to the Massachusetts Constitution, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-8\">\u201cAll people are bom free and equal and have certain natural, essential and unalienable rights; among which may be reckoned the right of enjoying and defending their lives and liberties; that of acquiring, possessing and protecting property; in fine, that of seeking and obtaining their safety and happiness. Equality under the law shall not be denied or abridged because of sex, race, color, creed or national origin.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b364-9\">This provision, even prior to its amendment, guaranteed to all people in the Commonwealth \u2014 equally \u2014 the enjoyment of rights that are deemed important or fundamental. The withholding of relief from the plaintiffs, who wish to marry, and are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>otherwise eligible to marry, on the ground that the couples are of the same gender, constitutes a categorical restriction of a fundamental right. The restriction creates a straightforward case of discrimination that disqualifies an entire group of our citizens and their families from participation in an institution of paramount legal and social importance. This is impermissible under art. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\">Analysis begins with the indisputable premise that the deprivation suffered by the plaintiffs is no mere legal inconvenience. The right to marry is not a privilege conferred by the State, but a fundamental right that is protected against unwarranted State interference. See <em>Zablocki </em>v. <em>Redhail, </em>434 U.S. 374, 384 (1978) (\u201cthe right to marry is of fundamental importance for all individuals\u201d); <em>Loving </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>388 U.S. 1, 12 (1967) (freedom to marry is \u201cone of the vital personal rights essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness by free men\u201d under due process clause of Fourteenth Amendment); <em>Skinner </em>v. <em>Oklahoma, </em>316 U.S. 535, 541 (1942) (marriage is one of \u201cbasic civil rights of man\u201d). See also <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Safley, </em>482 U.S. 78, 95-96 (1987) (prisoners\u2019 right to marry is constitutionally protected). This right is essentially vitiated if one is denied the right to marry a person of one\u2019s choice. See <em>Zablocki </em>v. <em>Redhail, supra </em>at 384 (all recent decisions of United States Supreme Court place \u201cthe decision to marry as among the personal decisions protected by the right of privacy\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">Because our marriage statutes intend, and state, the ordinary understanding that marriage under our law consists only of a union between a man and a woman, they create a statutory classification based on the sex of the two people who wish to marry. See <em>Baehr </em>v. <em>Lewin, </em>74 Haw. 530, 564 (1993) (plurality opinion) (Hawaii marriage statutes created sex-based classification); <em>Baker </em>v. <em>State, </em>170 Vt. 194, 253 (1999) (Johnson, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (same). That the classification is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>sex based is self-evident. The marriage statutes prohibit some applicants, such as the plaintiffs, from obtaining a marriage license, and that prohibition is based solely on the applicants\u2019 gender. As a factual matter, an individual\u2019s choice of marital partner is constrained because of his or her own sex. Stated in particular terms, Hillary Goodridge cannot marry Julie Goodridge because she (Hillary) is a woman. Likewise, Gary Chalmers cannot marry Richard Linnell because he (Gary) is a man. Only their gender prevents Hillary and Gary from marrying their chosen partners under the present law.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">A classification may be gender based whether or not the challenged government action apportions benefits or burdens uniformly along gender lines. This is so because constitutional protections extend to individuals and not to categories of people. Thus, when an individual desires to marry, but cannot marry his or her chosen partner because of the traditional opposite-sex restriction, a violation of art. 1 has occurred. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chou, </em>433 Mass. 229, 237-238 (2001) (assuming statute enforceable only across gender lines may offend Massachusetts equal rights amendment). I find it disingenuous, at best, to suggest that such an individual\u2019s right to marry has not been burdened at all, because he or she remains free to chose another partner, who is of the opposite sex.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">The equal protection infirmity at work here is strikingly similar to (although, perhaps, more subtle than) the invidious discrimination perpetuated by Virginia\u2019s antimiscegenation laws <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>and unveiled in the decision of <em>Loving </em>v. <em>Virginia, supra. </em>In its landmark decision striking down Virginia\u2019s ban on marriages between Caucasians and members of any other race on both equal protection and substantive due process grounds, the United States Supreme Court soundly rejected the proposition that the equal application of the ban (i.e., that it applied equally to whites and blacks) made unnecessary the strict scrutiny analysis traditionally required of statutes drawing classifications according to race, see <em>id. </em>at 8-9, and concluded that \u201crestricting the freedom to marry solely because of racial classifications violates the central meaning of the Equal Protection Clause.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 12. That our marriage laws, unlike antimiscegenation laws, were not enacted purposely to discriminate in no way neutralizes their present discriminatory character.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">With these two propositions established (the infringement on a fundamental right and a sex-based classification), the enforcement of the marriage statutes as they are currently understood is forbidden by our Constitution unless the State can present a compelling purpose furthered by the statutes that can be accomplished in no other reasonable manner.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See <em>Blixt </em>v. <em>Blixt, </em>437 Mass. 649, 655-656 (2002), cert, denied, 537 U.S. 1189 (2003); <em>Lowell </em>v. <em>Kowalski, </em>380 Mass. 663, 667-669 (1980). This the State has not done. The justifications put forth by the State to sustain the statute\u2019s exclusion of the plaintiffs are insufficient for the reasons explained by the court, to which I add the following observations.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">The rights of couples to have children, to adopt, and to be foster parents, regardless of sexual orientation and marital status, are firmly established. See <em>E.N.O. </em>v. <em>L.M.M., </em>429 Mass. 824, 829, cert, denied, 528 U.S. 1005 (1999); <em>Adoption of Tammy, </em>416 Mass. 205, 210-211 (1993). As recognized in the court\u2019s opinion, and demonstrated by the record in this case, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>the State\u2019s refusal to accord legal recognition to unions of same-sex couples has had the effect of creating a system in which children of same-sex couples are unable to partake of legal protections and social benefits taken for granted by children in families whose parents are of the opposite sex. The continued maintenance of this caste-like system is irreconcilable with, indeed, totally repugnant to, the State\u2019s strong interest in the welfare of all children and its primary focus, in the context of family law where children are concerned, on \u201cthe best interests of the child.\u201d The issue at stake is not one, as might ordinarily be the case, that can be unilaterally and totally deferred to the wisdom of the Legislature. \u201cWhile the State retains wide latitude to decide the manner in which it will allocate benefits, it may not use criteria which discriminatorily burden the exercise of a fundamental right.\u201d <em>Moe </em>v. <em>Secretary of Admin. &amp; Fin., </em>382 Mass. 629, 652 (1981). Nor can the State\u2019s wish to conserve resources be accomplished by invidious distinctions between classes of citizens. See <em>Plyler </em>v. <em>Doe, </em>457 U.S. 202, 216-217, 227 (1982).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">A comment is in order with respect to the insistence of some that marriage is, as a matter of definition, the legal union of a man and a woman. To define the institution of marriage by the characteristics of those to whom it always has been accessible, in order to justify the exclusion of those to whom it never has been accessible, is conclusory and bypasses the core question we are asked to decide.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This case calls for a higher level of legal analysis. Precisely, the case requires that we confront ingrained assumptions with respect to historically accepted roles of men and women within the institution of marriage and requires that we reexamine these assumptions in light of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>unequivocal language of art. 1, in order to ensure that the governmental conduct challenged here conforms to the supreme charter of our Commonwealth. \u201cA written constitution is the fundamental law for the government of a sovereign State. It is the final statement of the rights, privileges and obligations of the citizens and the ultimate grant of the powers and the conclusive definition of the limitations of the departments of State and of public officers . . . . To its provisions the conduct of all governmental affairs must conform. From its terms there is no appeal.\u201d <em>Loring </em>v. <em>Young, </em>239 Mass. 349, 376-377 (1921). I do not doubt the sincerity of deeply held moral or religious beliefs that make inconceivable to some the notion that any change in the common-law definition of what constitutes a legal civil marriage is now, or ever would be, warranted. But, as matter of constitutional law, neither the mantra of tradition, nor individual conviction, can justify the perpetuation of a hierarchy in which couples of the same sex and their families are deemed less worthy of social and legal recognition than couples of the opposite sex and their families. See <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>123 S. Ct. 2472, 2486 (2003) (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring) (moral disapproval, with no other valid State interest, cannot justify law that discriminates against groups of persons); <em>Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. </em>v. <em>Casey, </em>505 U.S. 833, 850 (1992) (\u201cOur obligation is to define the liberty of all, not to mandate our own moral code\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">(b) I am hopeful that our decision will be accepted by those thoughtful citizens who believe that same-sex unions should not be approved by the State. I am not referring here to acceptance in the sense of grudging acknowledgment of the court\u2019s authority to adjudicate the matter. My hope is more liberating. The plaintiffs are members of our community, our neighbors, our coworkers, our friends. As pointed out by the court, their professions include investment advisor, computer engineer, teacher, therapist, and lawyer. The plaintiffs volunteer in our schools, worship beside us in our religious houses, and have children who play with our children, to mention just a few ordinary daily contacts. We share a common humanity and participate together in the social contract that is the foundation of our Commonwealth. Simple principles of decency dictate that we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>extend to the plaintiffs, and to their new status, full acceptance, tolerance, and respect. We should do so because it is the right thing to do. The union of two people contemplated by G. L. c. 207 \u201cis a coming together for better or for worse, hopefully enduring, and intimate to the degree of being sacred. It is an association that promotes a way of life, not causes; a harmony in living, not political faiths; a bilateral loyalty, not commercial or social projects. Yet it is an association for as noble a purpose as any involved in our prior decisions.\u201d <em>Griswold </em>v. <em>Connecticut, </em>381 U.S. 479, 486 (1965). Because of the terms of art. 1, the plaintiffs will no longer be excluded from that association.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b365-6\">It makes no difference that the referenced decisions consider the right to marry in the context of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution rather than in the context of our Constitution. As explained by the court, <em>ante </em>at 328 n.18, a fundamental right under the Federal Constitution enjoys at least a comparable measure of protection under our State Constitution. See <em>Moe </em>v. <em>Secretary of Admin. &amp; Fin., </em>382 Mass. 629, 651 (1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b366-7\">In her separate opinion in <em>Baker </em>v. <em>State, </em>170 Vt. 194, 253 (1999) (Johnson, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part), Justice Johnson described the equal protection defect in Vermont\u2019s marriage statutes in a slightly different, but no less persuasive, fashion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-8\">\u201cA woman is denied the right to marry another woman because her would-be partner is a woman, not because one or both are lesbians. Similarly, a man is denied the right to marry another man because his would-be partner is a man, not because one or both are gay. Thus, an individual\u2019s right to marry a person of the same sex is prohibited solely on the basis of sex, not on the basis of sexual orientation. Indeed, sexual orientation does not appear as a qualification for marriage under the marriage statutes. The State makes no inquiry into the sexual practices or identities of a couple seeking a license.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b367-7\">Some might say that the use of the so-called strict scrutiny formula is too facile in the sense that, once a court focuses on the formula as a dispositional tool, the result is automatically preordained \u2014 the statute will fail because the State cannot possibly sustain its heavy burden to overcome the presumption of arbitrary and invidious discrimination. This is not so. See, e.g., <em>Blixt </em>v. <em>Blixt, </em>437 Mass. 649, 656-657 (2002), cert, denied, 537 U.S. 1189 (2003) (concluding G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 39D, grandparent visitation statute, furthered compelling State interest in mitigating potential harm to children in nonintact families).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b368-6\">The argument, made by some in the case, that legalization of same-sex marriage in Massachusetts will be used by persons in other States as a tool to obtain recognition of a marriage in their State that is otherwise unlawful, is precluded by the provisions of G. L. c. 207, \u00a7\u00a7 11, 12, and 13.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b368-7\">Because marriage is, by all accounts, the cornerstone of our social structure, as well as the defining relationship in our personal lives, confining eligibility in the institution, and all of its accompanying benefits and responsibilities, to opposite-sex couples is basely unfair. To justify the restriction in our marriage laws by accusing the plaintiffs of attempting to change the institution of marriage itself terminates the debate at the outset without any accompanying reasoned analysis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b370-6\">Justice Cordy\u2019s separate opinion points out, correctly, that, when art. 1 was revised by the people in 1976, it was not then intended to be relied on to approve same-sex marriage. <em>Post </em>at 377-379 (Cordy, J., dissenting). (Justice Spina adverts to the same proposition in his separate opinion, <em>post </em>at 355 [Spina, J., dissenting]). Decisions construing the provision cited in Justice Cordy\u2019s opinion are interesting, but obviously inapposite because they have not dealt in any significant way with the issue before us. Nonetheless, the separate opinion concludes, from what was intended in 1976, and from various cases discussing art. 1, that the revised provision cannot be used to justify the result I reach.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">In so reasoning, the separate opinion places itself squarely on the side of the original intent school of constitutional interpretation. As a general principle, I do not accept the philosophy of the school. The Massachusetts Constitution was never meant to create dogma that adopts inflexible views of one time to deny lawful rights to those who live in another. The provisions of our Constitution are, and must be, adaptable to changing circumstances and new societal phenomena, and, unless and until the people speak again on a specific subject, conformable in their concepts of liberty and equality to what is fair, right, and just. I am cognizant of the voters\u2019 intent in passing the amendment to art. 1 in 1976. Were the revision alone the basis for change, I would be reluctant to construe it favorably to the plaintiffs, in view of the amendment\u2019s recent passage and the voters\u2019 intent. The court\u2019s opinion, however, rests in part on well-established principles of equal protection that are independent of the amendment. It is on these principles that I base my opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-5\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b370-5\">Spina, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Art\">(dissenting, with whom Sosman and Cordy, JJ., join). What is at stake in this case is not the unequal treatment of individuals or whether individual rights have been impermissibly burdened, but the power of the Legislature to effectuate social change without interference from the courts, pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>art. 30 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The power to regulate marriage lies with the Legislature, not with the judiciary. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stowell, </em>389 Mass. 171, 175 (1983). Today, the court has transformed its role as protector of individual rights into the role of creator of rights, and I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">1. <em>Equal protection. </em>Although the court did not address the plaintiffs\u2019 gender discrimination claim, G. L. c. 207 does not unconstitutionally discriminate on the basis of gender.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A claim of gender discrimination will lie where it is shown that differential treatment disadvantages one sex over the other. See <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Interscholastic Athletic Ass\u2019n, </em>378 Mass. 342, 349-352 (1979). See also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>518 U.S. 515 (1996). General Laws c. 207 enumerates certain qualifications for obtaining a marriage license. It creates no distinction between the sexes, but applies to men and women in precisely the same way. It does not create any disadvantage identified with gender, as both men and women are similarly limited to marrying a person of the opposite sex. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, </em>374 Mass. 5, 15-22 (1977) (law prohibiting prostitution not discriminatory based on gender because of equal application to men and women).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">Similarly, the marriage statutes do not discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation. As the court correctly recognizes, constitutional protections are extended to individuals, not couples. <em>Ante </em>at 326 n.15. The marriage statutes do not disqualify individuals on the basis of sexual orientation from entering into marriage. All individuals, with certain exceptions not relevant here, are free to marry. Whether an individual chooses not to marry because of sexual orientation or any other reason should be of no concern to the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">The court concludes, however, that G. L. c. 207 unconstitutionally discriminates against the individual plaintiffs because it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>denies them the \u201cright to marry the person of one\u2019s choice\u201d where that person is of the same sex. <em>Ante </em>at 328. To reach this result the court relies on <em>Loving </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>388 U.S. 1, 12 (1967), and transforms \u201cchoice\u201d into the essential element of the institution of marriage. The <em>Loving </em>case did not use the word \u201cchoice\u201d in this manner, and it did not point to the result that the court reaches today. In <em>Loving, </em>the Supreme Court struck down as unconstitutional a statute that prohibited Caucasians from marrying non-Caucasians. It concluded that the statute was intended to preserve white supremacy and invidiously discriminated against non-Caucasians because of their race. See <em>id. </em>at 11-12. The \u201cchoice\u201d to which the Supreme Court referred was the \u201cchoice to marry,\u201d and it concluded that with respect to the institution of marriage, the State had no compelling interest in limiting the choice to marry along racial lines. <em>Id. </em>The Supreme Court did not imply the existence of a right to marry a person of the same sex. To the same effect is <em>Perez </em>v. <em>Sharp, </em>32 Cal. 2d 711 (1948), on which the court also relies.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">Unlike the <em>Loving </em>and <em>Sharp </em>cases, the Massachusetts Legislature has erected no barrier to marriage that intentionally discriminates against anyone. Within the institution of marriage,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> anyone is free to marry, with certain exceptions that are not challenged. In the absence of any discriminatory purpose, the State\u2019s marriage statutes do not violate principles of equal protection. See <em>Washington </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>426 U.S. 229, 240 (1976) (\u201cinvidious quality of a law claimed to be . . . discriminatory must ultimately be traced to a . . . discriminatory purpose\u201d); <em>Dickerson </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>396 Mass. 740, 743 (1986) (for purpose of equal protection analysis, standard of review under State and Federal Constitutions is identical). See also <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Interscholastic Athletic Ass\u2019n, supra. </em>This court should not have invoked even the most deferential standard of review within equal protection analysis because no individual was denied access to the institution of marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">2. <em>Due process. </em>The marriage statutes do not impermissibly burden a right protected by our constitutional guarantee of due <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>process implicit in art. 10 of our Declaration of Rights. There is no restriction on the right of any plaintiff to enter into marriage. Each is free to marry a willing person of the opposite sex. Cf. <em>Zablocki </em>v. <em>Redhail, </em>434 U.S. 374 (1978) (fundamental right to marry impermissibly burdened by statute requiring court approval when subject to child support order).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">Substantive due process protects individual rights against unwarranted government intrusion. See <em>Aime </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>414 Mass. 667, 673 (1993). The court states, as we have said on many occasions, that the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights may protect a right in ways that exceed the protection afforded by the Federal Constitution. <em>Ante </em>at 328. See <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>514 U.S. 1, 8 (1995) (State courts afforded broader protection of rights than granted by United States Constitution). However, today the court does not fashion a remedy that affords greater protection of a right. Instead, using the rubric of due process, it has redefined marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">Although art. 10 may afford greater protection of rights than the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, our treatment of due process challenges adheres to the same standards followed in Federal due process analysis. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>429 Mass. 362, 371 (1999). When analyzing a claim that the State has impermissibly burdened an individual\u2019s fundamental or other right or liberty interest, \u201c[w]e begin by sketching the contours of the right asserted. We then inquire whether the challenged restriction burdens that right.\u201d <em>Moe </em>v. <em>Secretary of Admin. &amp; Fin., </em>382 Mass. 629, 646 (1981). Where a right deemed \u201cfundamental\u201d is implicated, the challenged restriction will be upheld only if it is \u201cnarrowly tailored to further a legitimate and compelling governmental interest.\u201d <em>Aime </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra </em>at 673. To qualify as \u201cfundamental\u201d the asserted right must be \u201cobjectively, \u2018deeply rooted in this Nation\u2019s history and tradition,\u2019 <em>[Moore </em>v. <em>East Cleveland, </em>431 U.S. 494, 503 (1977) (plurality opinion)] . . . and \u2018implicit in the concept of ordered liberty,\u2019 such that \u2018neither liberty nor justice would exist if they were sacrificed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Washington </em>v. <em>Glucksberg, </em>521 U.S. 702, 720-721 (1997), quoting <em>Palko </em>v. <em>Connecticut, </em>302 U.S. 319, 325, 326 (1937) (right to assisted suicide does not fall within fundamental right to refuse medical treatment because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>novel and unsupported by tradition) (citations omitted). See <em>Three Juveniles </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>390 Mass. 357, 367 (1983) (O\u2019Connor, J., dissenting), cert, denied sub nom. <em>Keefe </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>465 U.S. 1068 (1984). Rights that are not considered fundamental merit due process protection if they have been irrationally burdened. See <em>Massachusetts Fed\u2019n of Teachers </em>v. <em>Board of Educ., </em>436 Mass. 763, 777-779 &amp; n.14 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">Although this court did not state that same-sex marriage is a fundamental right worthy of strict scrutiny protection, it nonetheless deemed it a constitutionally protected right by applying rational basis review. Before applying any level of constitutional analysis there must be a recognized right at stake. Same-sex marriage, or the \u201cright to marry the person of one\u2019s choice\u201d as the court today defines that right, does not fall within the fundamental right to marry. Same-sex marriage is not \u201cdeeply rooted in this Nation\u2019s history,\u201d and the court does not suggest that it is. Except for the occasional isolated decision in recent years, see, e.g., <em>Baker </em>v. <em>State, </em>170 Vt. 194 (1999), same-sex marriage is not a right, fundamental or otherwise, recognized in this country. Just one example of the Legislature\u2019s refusal to recognize same-sex marriage can be found in a section of the legislation amending G. L. c. 15 IB to prohibit discrimination in the workplace on the basis of sexual orientation, which states: \u201cNothing in this act shall be construed so as to legitimize or validate a \u2018homosexual marriage\u2019. . . .\u201d St. 1989, c. 516, \u00a7 19. In this Commonwealth and in this country, the roots of the institution of marriage are deeply set in history as a civil union between a single man and a single woman. There is no basis for the court to recognize same-sex marriage as a constitutionally protected right.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">3. <em>Remedy. </em>The remedy that the court has fashioned both in the name of equal protection and due process exceeds the bounds of judicial restraint mandated by art. 30. The remedy that construes gender-specific language as gender-neutral amounts to a statutory revision that replaces the intent of the Legislature with that of the court. Article 30 permits the court to apply principles of equal protection and to modify statutory language only if legislative intent is preserved. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chou, </em>433 Mass. 229, 238-239 (2001) (judicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>rewriting of gender language permissible only when Legislature intended to include both men and women). See also <em>Lowell </em>v. <em>Kowalski, </em>380 Mass. 663, 670 (1980). Here, the alteration of the gender-specific language alters precisely what the Legislature unambiguously intended to preserve, the marital rights of single men and women. Such a dramatic change in social institutions must remain at the behest of the people through the democratic process.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">Where the application of equal protection principles do not permit rewriting a statute in a manner that preserves the intent of the Legislature, we do not rewrite the statute. In <em>Dalli </em>v. <em>Board of Educ., </em>358 Mass. 753 (1971), the court refused to rewrite a statute in a manner that would include unintended individuals. \u201cTo attempt to interpret this [statute] as including those in the category of the plaintiff would be to engage in a judicial enlargement of the clear statutory language beyond the limit of our judicial function. We have traditionally and consistently declined to trespass on legislative territory in deference to the time tested wisdom of the separation of powers as expressed in art. [30] of the Declaration of Rights of the Constitution of Massachusetts even when it appeared that a highly desirable and just result might thus be achieved.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 759. Recently, in <em>Connors </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>430 Mass. 31 (1999), we refused to expand health insurance coverage to include domestic partners because such an expansion was within the province of the Legislature, where policy affecting family relationships is most appropriate and frequently considered. <em>Id. </em>at 42-43. Principles of equal protection do not permit the marriage statutes to be changed in the manner that we have seen today.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">This court has previously exercised the judicial restraint mandated by art. 30 and declined to extend due process protection to rights not traditionally coveted, despite recognition of their social importance. See <em>Tobin\u2019s Case, </em>424 Mass. 250, 252-253 (1997) (receiving workers\u2019 compensation benefits not fundamental right); <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Superintendent of Schs. of Worcester, </em>421 Mass. 117, 129 (1995) (declaring education not fundamental right); <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Executive Office of Human Servs., </em>414 Mass. 551, 565 (1993) (no fundamental right to receive mental health services); <em>Matter of Tocci, </em>413 Mass. 542, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>548 n.4 (1992) (no fundamental right to practice law); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Henry\u2019s Drywall Co., </em>366 Mass. 539, 542 (1974) (no fundamental right to pursue one\u2019s business). Courts have authority to recognize rights that are supported by the Constitution and history, but the power to create novel rights is reserved for the people through the democratic and legislative processes.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">Likewise, the Supreme Court exercises restraint in the application of substantive due process \u201c \u2018because guideposts for responsible decisionmaking in this unchartered area are scarce and open-ended.\u2019 <em>[Collins </em>v. <em>Harker Heights, </em>503 U.S. 115, 125 (1992).] By extending constitutional protection to an asserted right or liberty interest, we, to a great extent, place the matter outside the arena of public debate and legislative action. We must therefore \u2018exercise the utmost care whenever we are asked to break new ground in this field,\u2019 <em>[id.], </em>lest the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause be subtly transformed into the policy preferences of the Members of this Court, <em>Moore </em>[v. <em>East Cleveland, </em>431 U.S. 494, 502 (1977)] (plurality opinion).\u201d <em>Washington </em>v. <em>Glucksberg, supra </em>at 720.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">The court has extruded a new right from principles of substantive due process, and in doing so it has distorted the meaning and purpose of due process. The purpose of substantive due process is to protect existing rights, not to create new rights. Its aim is to thwart government intrusion, not invite it. The court asserts that the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights serves to guard against government intrusion into each individual\u2019s sphere of privacy. <em>Ante </em>at 329. Similarly, the Supreme Court has called for increased due process protection when individual privacy and intimacy are threatened by unnecessary government imposition. See, e.g., <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>123 S. Ct. 2472 (2003) (private nature of sexual behavior implicates increased due process protection); <em>Eisenstadt </em>v. <em>Baird, </em>405 U.S. 438 (1972) (privacy protection extended to procreation decisions within nonmarital context); <em>Griswold </em>v. <em>Connecticut, </em>381 U.S. 479 (1965) (due process invoked because of intimate nature of procreation decisions). These cases, along with the <em>Moe </em>case, focus on the threat to privacy when government seeks to regulate the most intimate activity behind bedroom doors. The statute in question does not seek to regulate intimate activity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>within an intimate relationship, but merely gives formal recognition to a particular marriage. The State has respected the private lives of the plaintiffs, and has done nothing to intrude in the relationships that each of the plaintiff couples enjoy. Cf. <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Texas, supra </em>at 2484 (case \u201cdoes not involve whether the government must give formal recognition to any relationship that homosexual persons seek to enter\u201d). Ironically, by extending the marriage laws to same-sex couples the court has turned substantive due process on its head and used it to interject government into the plaintiffs\u2019 lives.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b371-8\"> Article 30 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights provides that \u201cthe judicial [department] shall never exercise the legislative and executive powers ... to the end it may be a government of laws and not of men.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b371-9\">Article 1 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, as amended by art. 106 of the Amendments, the Equal Rights Amendment, states: \u201cEquality under the law shall not be denied or abridged because of sex, race, color, creed or national origin.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b372-6\">Marriage is the civil union between a single man and a single woman.

In applying the rational basis test to any challenged statutory scheme, the issue is not whether the Legislature\u2019s rationale behind that scheme is persuasive to us, but only whether it satisfies a minimal threshold of rationality. Today, rather than apply that test, the court announces that, because it is persuaded that there are no differences between same-sex and opposite-sex couples, the Legislature has no rational basis for treating them differently with respect to the granting of marriage licenses.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Reduced to its essence, the court\u2019s opinion concludes that, because same-sex couples are now raising children, and withholding the benefits of civil marriage from their union makes it harder for them to raise those children, the State must therefore provide the benefits of civil marriage to same-sex couples just as it does to opposite-sex couples. Of course, many people are raising children outside the confines of traditional marriage, and, by definition, those children are being deprived of the various benefits that would flow if they were being raised in a household with married parents. That does not mean that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>Legislature must accord the full benefits of marital status on every household raising children. Rather, the Legislature need only have some rational basis for concluding that, at present, those alternate family structures have not yet been conclusively shown to be the equivalent of the marital family structure that has established itself as a successful one over a period of centuries. People are of course at liberty to raise their children in various family structures, so long as they are not literally harming their children by doing so. See <em>Blixt </em>v. <em>Blixt, </em>437 Mass. 649, 668-670 (2002) (Sosman, J., dissenting), cert, denied, 537 U.S. 1189 (2003). That does not mean that the State is required to provide identical forms of encouragement, endorsement, and support to all of the infinite variety of household structures that a free society permits.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">Based on our own philosophy of child rearing, and on our observations of the children being raised by same-sex couples to whom we are personally close, we may be of the view that what matters to children is not the gender, or sexual orientation, or even the number of the adults who raise them, but rather whether those adults provide the children with a nurturing, stable, safe, consistent, and supportive environment in which to mature. Same-sex couples can provide their children with the requisite nurturing, stable, safe, consistent, and supportive environment in which to mature, just as opposite-sex couples do. It is therefore understandable that the court might view the traditional definition of marriage as an unnecessary anachronism, rooted in historical prejudices that modem society has in large measure rejected and biological limitations that modem science has overcome.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">It is not, however, our assessment that matters. Conspicuously absent from the court\u2019s opinion today is any acknowledgment that the attempts at scientific study of the ramifications of raising children in same-sex couple households are themselves in their infancy and have so far produced inconclusive and conflicting results. Notwithstanding our belief that gender and sexual orientation of parents should not matter to the success of the child rearing venture, studies to date reveal that there are still some observable differences between children raised by opposite-sex couples and children raised by same-sex couples. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>See <em>post </em>at 386-387 (Cordy, J., dissenting). Interpretation of the data gathered by those studies then becomes clouded by the personal and political beliefs of the investigators, both as to whether the differences identified are positive or negative, and as to the untested explanations of what might account for those differences. (This is hardly the first time in history that the ostensible steel of the scientific method has melted and buckled under the intense heat of political and religious passions.) Even in the absence of bias or political agenda behind the various studies of children raised by same-sex couples, the most neutral and strict application of scientific principles to this field would be constrained by the limited period of observation that has been available. Gay and lesbian couples living together openly, and official recognition of them as their children\u2019s sole parents, comprise a very recent phenomenon, and the recency of that phenomenon has not yet permitted any study of how those children fare as adults and at best minimal study of how they fare during their adolescent years. The Legislature can rationally view the state of the scientific evidence as unsettled on the critical question it now faces: Are families headed by same-sex parents equally successful in rearing children from infancy to adulthood as families headed by parents of opposite sexes? Our belief that children raised by same-sex couples <em>should </em>fare the same as children raised in traditional families is just that: a passionately held but utterly untested belief. The Legislature is not required to share that belief but may, as the creator of the institution of civil marriage, wish to see the proof before making a fundamental alteration to that institution.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">Although ostensibly applying the rational basis test to the civil marriage statutes, it is abundantly apparent that the court is in fact applying some undefined stricter standard to assess the constitutionality of the marriage statutes\u2019 exclusion of same-sex couples. While avoiding any express conclusion as to any of the proffered routes by which that exclusion would be subjected to a test of strict scrutiny \u2014 infringement of a fundamental right, discrimination based on gender, or discrimination against gays and lesbians as a suspect classification \u2014 the opinion repeatedly alludes to those concepts in a prolonged and eloquent prelude before articulating its view that the exclusion lacks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>even a rational basis. See, e.g., <em>ante </em>at 313 (noting that State Constitution is \u201cmore protective of individual liberty and equality,\u201d demands \u201cbroader protection for fundamental rights,\u201d and is \u201cless tolerant of government intrusion into the protected spheres of private life\u201d than Federal Constitution); <em>ante </em>at 322 (describing decision to marry and choice of marital partner as \u201camong life\u2019s momentous acts of self-definition\u201d); <em>ante </em>at 326 (repeated references to \u201cright to marry\u201d as \u201cfundamental\u201d); <em>ante </em>at 327-328 (repeated comparisons to statutes prohibiting interracial marriage, which were predicated on suspect classification of race); <em>ante </em>at 328 (characterizing ban on same-sex marriage as \u201cinvidious\u201d discrimination that \u201cdeprives individuals of access to an institution of fundamental legal, personal, and social significance\u201d and again noting that Massachusetts Constitution \u201cprotects matters of personal liberty against government incursion\u201d more zealously than Federal Constitution); <em>ante </em>at 329 (characterizing \u201cwhom to marry, how to express sexual intimacy, and whether and how to establish a family\u201d as \u201camong the most basic of every individual\u2019s liberty and due process rights\u201d); <em>id. </em>(\u201cliberty interest in choosing whether and whom to marry would be hollow\u201d if Commonwealth could \u201cforeclose an individual from freely choosing the person\u201d to marry); <em>ante </em>at 333 (opining that in \u201coverlapping realms of personal autonomy, marriage, family life, and child rearing,\u201d characterized as \u201cfundamentally private areas of fife,\u201d court uses \u201cintegrated\u201d analysis instead of \u201cnarrow focus\u201d). See also <em>ante </em>at 337 n.29 (suggesting that prohibition on same-sex marriage \u201cimpose[s] limits on personal beliefs\u201d); <em>ante </em>at 339 n.31 (suggesting that \u201ctotal deference\u201d to Legislature in this case would be equivalent to \u201cstrip[ping]\u201d judiciary \u201cof its constitutional authority to decide challenges\u201d in such areas as forced sterilization, antimiscegenation statutes, and abortion, even though all cited examples pertain to fundamental rights analyzed under strict scrutiny, not under rational basis test); <em>ante </em>at 339 (civil marriage as \u201ca right of fundamental importance\u201d); <em>ante </em>at 341 (noting State policy of \u201cpreventing discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation\u201d); <em>id. </em>(prohibition against same-sex marriage inconsistent with \u201cgender-neutral laws promoting stable families,\u201d and \u201crooted in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>persistent prejudices against\u201d homosexuals); <em>ante </em>at 342 (prohibition against same-sex marriage \u201cviolates the basic premises of individual liberty\u201d). In short, while claiming to apply a mere rational basis test, the court\u2019s opinion works up an enormous head of steam by repeated invocations of avenues by which to subject the statute to strict scrutiny, apparently hoping that that head of steam will generate momentum sufficient to propel the opinion across the yawning chasm of the very deferential rational basis test.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">Shorn of these emotion-laden invocations, the opinion ultimately opines that the Legislature is acting irrationally when it grants benefits to a proven successful family structure while denying the same benefits to a recent, perhaps promising, but essentially untested alternate family structure. Placed in a more neutral context, the court would never find any irrationality in such an approach. For example, if the issue were government subsidies and tax benefits promoting use of an established technology for energy efficient heating, the court would find no equal protection or due process violation in the Legislature\u2019s decision not to grant the same benefits to an inventor or manufacturer of some new, alternative technology who did not yet have sufficient data to prove that that new technology was just as good as the established technology. That the early results from preliminary testing of the new technology might look very promising, or that the theoretical underpinnings of the new technology might appear flawless, would not make it irrational for the Legislature to grant subsidies and tax breaks to the established technology and deny them to the still unproved newcomer in the field. While programs that affect families and children register higher on our emotional scale than programs affecting energy efficiency, our standards for what is or is not \u201crational\u201d should not be bent by those emotional tugs. Where, as here, there is no ground for applying strict scrutiny, the emotionally compelling nature of the subject matter should not affect the manner in which we apply the rational basis test.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">Or, to the extent that the court is going to invoke such emotion-laden and value-laden rhetoric as a means of heightening the degree of scrutiny to be applied, the same form of rhetoric can be employed to justify the Legislature\u2019s proceeding with extreme caution in this area. In considering whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>Legislature has a rational reason for postponing a dramatic change to the definition of marriage, it is surely pertinent to the inquiry to recognize that this proffered change affects not just a load-bearing wall of our social structure but the very cornerstone of that structure. See <em>post </em>at 393 (Cordy, J., dissenting). Before making a fundamental alteration to that cornerstone, it is eminently rational for the Legislature to require a high degree of certainty as to the precise consequences of that alteration, to make sure that it can be done safely, without either temporary or lasting damage to the structural integrity of the entire edifice. The court today blithely assumes that there are no such dangers and that it is safe to proceed (see <em>ante </em>at 340), an assumption that is not supported by anything more than the court\u2019s blind faith that it is so.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">More importantly, it is not our confidence in the lack of adverse consequences that is at issue, or even whether that confidence is justifiable. The issue is whether it is rational to reserve judgment on whether this change can be made at this time without damaging the institution of marriage or adversely affecting the critical role it has played in our society. Absent consensus on the issue (which obviously does not exist), or unanimity amongst scientists studying the issue (which also does not exist), or a more prolonged period of observation of this new family structure (which has not yet been possible), it is rational for the Legislature to postpone any redefinition of marriage that would include same-sex couples until such time as it is certain that that redefinition will not have unintended and undesirable social consequences. Through the political process, the people may decide when the benefits of extending civil marriage to same-sex couples have been shown to outweigh whatever risks \u2014 be they palpable or ephemeral \u2014 are involved. However minimal the risks of that redefinition of marriage may seem to us from our vantage point, it is not up to us to decide what risks society must run, and it is inappropriate for us to arrogate that power to ourselves merely because we are confident that \u201cit is the right thing to do.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 350 (Greaney, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">As a matter of social history, today\u2019s opinion may represent a great turning point that many will hail as a tremendous step <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>toward a more just society. As a matter of constitutional jurisprudence, however, the case stands as an aberration. To reach the result it does, the court has tortured the rational basis test beyond recognition. I fully appreciate the strength of the temptation to find this particular law unconstitutional \u2014 there is much to be said for the argument that excluding gay and lesbian couples from the benefits of civil marriage is cruelly unfair and hopelessly outdated; the inability to marry has a profound impact on the personal lives of committed gay and lesbian couples (and their children) to whom we are personally close (our friends, neighbors, family members, classmates, and co-workers); and our resolution of this issue takes place under the intense glare of national and international publicity. Speaking metaphorically, these factors have combined to turn the case before us into a \u201cperfect storm\u201d of a constitutional question. In my view, however, such factors make it all the more imperative that we adhere precisely and scrupulously to the established guideposts of our constitutional jurisprudence, a jurisprudence that makes the rational basis test an extremely deferential one that focuses on the rationality, not the persuasiveness, of the potential justifications for the classifications in the legislative scheme. I trust that, once this particular \u201cstorm\u201d clears, we will return to the rational basis test as it has always been understood and applied. Applying that deferential test in the manner it is customarily applied, the exclusion of gay and lesbian couples from the institution of civil marriage passes constitutional muster. I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b377-5\">The one difference that the court acknowledges \u2014 that sexual relations between persons of the same sex does not result in pregnancy and childbirth \u2014 it immediately brushes aside on the theory that civil marriage somehow has nothing to do with begetting children. <em>Ante </em>at 331-333. For the reasons explained in detail in Justice Cordy\u2019s dissent, in which I join, the reasons justifying the civil marriage laws are inextricably linked to the fact that human sexual intercourse between a man and a woman frequently results in pregnancy and childbirth. Indeed, as Justice Cordy outlines, that fact lies at the core of why society fashioned the institution of marriage in the first place. <em>Post </em>at 381-382 (Cordy, J., dissenting).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-7\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b383-5\">Cordy, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AsY\">(dissenting, with whom Spina and Sosman, JJ., join). The court\u2019s opinion concludes that the Department of Public Health has failed to identify any \u201cconstitutionally adequate reason\u201d for limiting civil marriage to opposite-sex unions, and that there is no \u201creasonable relationship\u201d between a disqualification of same-sex couples who wish to enter into a civil marriage and the protection of public health, safety, or general welfare. Consequently, it holds that the marriage statute cannot withstand scrutiny under the Massachusetts Constitution. Because I find these conclusions to be unsupportable in light of the nature of the rights and regulations at issue, the presumption <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>of constitutional validity and significant deference afforded to legislative enactments, and the \u201cundesirability of the judiciary substituting its notions of correct policy for that of a popularly elected Legislature\u201d responsible for making such policy, <em>Zayre Corp. </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>372 Mass. 423, 433 (1977), I respectfully dissent. Although it may be desirable for many reasons to extend to same-sex couples the benefits and burdens of civil marriage (and the plaintiffs have made a powerfully reasoned case for that extension), that decision must be made by the Legislature, not the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">If a statute either impairs the exercise of a fundamental right protected by the due process or liberty provisions of our State Constitution, or discriminates based on a constitutionally suspect classification such as sex, it will be subject to strict scrutiny when its validity is challenged. See <em>Blixt </em>v. <em>Blixt, </em>437 Mass. 649, 655-656, 660-661 (2002), cert, denied, 537 U.S. 1189 (2003) (fundamental right); <em>Lowell </em>v. <em>Kowalski, </em>380 Mass. 663, 666 (1980) (sex-based classification). If it does neither, a statute \u201cwill be upheld if it is \u2018rationally related to a legitimate State purpose.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hallett </em>v. <em>Wrentham, </em>398 Mass. 550, 557 (1986), quoting <em>Paro </em>v. <em>Longwood Hosp., </em>373 Mass. 645, 649 (1977). This test, referred to in State and Federal constitutional jurisprudence as the \u201crational basis test,\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is virtually identical in substance and effect to the test applied to a law promulgated under the State\u2019s broad police powers (pursuant to which the marriage statutes and most other licensing and regulatory laws are enacted): that is, the law is valid if it is reasonably related to the protection of public health, safety, or general welfare. See, e.g., <em>Leigh </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Nursing, </em>395 Mass. 670, 682-683 (1985) (applying rational basis review to question of State exercise of police power).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">The Massachusetts marriage statute does not impair the exercise of a recognized fundamental right, or discriminate on the basis of sex in violation of the equal rights amendment to the Massachusetts Constitution. Consequently, it is subject to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>review only to determine whether it satisfies the rational basis test. Because a conceivable rational basis exists upon which the Legislature could conclude that the marriage statute furthers the legitimate State purpose of ensuring, promoting, and supporting an optimal social structure for the bearing and raising of children, it is a valid exercise of the State\u2019s police power.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">A. <em>Limiting marriage to the union of one man and one woman does not impair the exercise of a fundamental right. </em>Civil marriage is an institution created by the State. In Massachusetts, the marriage statutes are derived from English common law, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Knowlton, </em>2 Mass. 530, 534 (1807), and were first enacted in colonial times. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Munson, </em>127 Mass. 459, 460 (1879). They were enacted to secure public interests and not for religious purposes or to promote personal interests or aspirations. (See discussion <em>infra </em>at 381-385 ). As the court notes in its opinion, the institution of marriage is \u201cthe legal union of a man and woman as husband and wife,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 319, and it has always been so under Massachusetts law, colonial or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">The plaintiffs contend that because the right to choose to marry is a \u201cfundamental\u201d right, the right to marry the person of one\u2019s choice, including a member of the same sex, must also be a \u201cfundamental\u201d right. While the court stops short of deciding that the right to marry someone of the same sex is \u201cfundamental\u201d such that strict scrutiny must be applied to any statute that impairs it, it nevertheless agrees with the plaintiffs that the right to choose to marry is of fundamental importance (\u201camong the most basic\u201d of every person\u2019s \u201cliberty and due process rights\u201d) and would be \u201chollow\u201d if an individual was foreclosed from \u201cfreely choosing the person with whom to share . . . the . . . institution of civil marriage.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 329. Hence, it concludes that a marriage license cannot be denied to an individual who wishes to marry someone of the same sex. In reaching this result the court has transmuted the \u201cright\u201d to marry into a right to change the institution of marriage itself. This feat of reasoning succeeds only if one accepts the proposition that the definition of the institution of marriage as a union between a man and a woman is merely \u201cconclusory\u201d (as suggested, <em>ante </em>at 348 [Greaney, J., concurring]), rather than the basis on which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>\u201cright\u201d to partake in it has been deemed to be of fundamental importance. In other words, only by assuming that \u201cmarriage\u201d includes the union of two persons of the same sex does the court conclude that restricting marriage to opposite-sex couples infringes on the \u201cright\u201d of same-sex couples to \u201cmarry.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">The plaintiffs ground their contention that they have a fundamental right to marry a person of the same sex in a long line of Supreme Court decisions, e.g., <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Safley, </em>482 U.S. 78 (1987); <em>Zablocki </em>v. <em>Redhail, </em>434 U.S. 374 (1978); <em>Loving </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>388 U.S. 1 (1967); <em>Griswold </em>v. <em>Connecticut, </em>381 U.S. 479 (1965); <em>Skinner </em>v. <em>Oklahoma, </em>316 U.S. 535 (1942); that discuss the importance of marriage. In context, all of these decisions and their discussions are about the \u201cfundamental\u201d nature of the institution of marriage as it has existed and been understood in this country, not as the court has redefined it today. Even in that context, its \u201cfundamental\u201d nature is derivative of the nature of the interests that underlie or are associated with it.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> An examination of those interests reveals that they are either not shared by same-sex couples or not implicated by the marriage statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">Supreme Court cases that have described marriage or the right to marry as \u201cfundamental\u201d have focused primarily on the underlying interest of every individual in procreation, which, historically, could only legally occur within the construct of marriage because sexual intercourse outside of marriage was a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>criminal act.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In <em>Skinner </em>v. <em>Oklahoma, supra, </em>the first case to characterize marriage as a \u201cfundamental\u201d right, the Supreme Court stated, as its rationale for striking down a sterilization statute, that \u201c[m]arriage and procreation are fundamental to the very existence of the race.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 541. In concluding that a sterilized individual \u201cis forever deprived of a basic liberty,\u201d <em>id., </em>the Court was obviously referring to procreation rather than marriage, as this court recognized in <em>Matter of Moe, </em>385 Mass. 555, 560 (1982). Similarly, in <em>Loving </em>v. <em>Virginia, supra, </em>in which the United States Supreme Court struck down Virginia\u2019s antimiscegenation statute, the Court implicitly linked marriage with procreation in describing marriage as \u201cfundamental to our very existence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 12. In <em>Zablocki </em>v. <em>Redhail, supra, </em>the Court expressly linked the right to marry with the right to procreate, concluding that \u201cif [the plaintiff\u2019s] right to procreate means anything at all, it must imply some right to enter the only relationship in which the State . . . allows sexual relations legally to take place.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 386. Once again, in <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Safley, supra, </em>striking a State regulation that curtailed the right of an inmate to marry, the Court included among the important attributes of such marriages the \u201cexpectation that [the marriage] ultimately will be fully consummated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 96. See <em>Milford </em>v. <em>Worcester, 1 </em>Mass. 48, 52 (1810) (purpose of marriage is \u201cto regulate, chasten, and refine, the intercourse between the sexes; and to multiply [and] preserve . . . the species\u201d). Because same-sex couples are unable to procreate on their own, any right to marriage they may possess cannot be based on their interest in procreation, which has been essential to the Supreme Court\u2019s denomination of the right to marry as fundamental.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">Supreme Court cases recognizing a right to privacy in intimate decision-making, e.g., <em>Griswold </em>v. <em>Connecticut, supra </em>(striking down statute prohibiting use of contraceptives); <em>Roe </em>v. <em>Wade, </em>410 U.S. 113 (1973) (striking down statute criminalizing abortion), have also focused primarily on sexual relations and the decision whether or not to procreate, and have refused to recognize an \u201cunlimited right\u201d to privacy. <em>Id. </em>at 154. Massachusetts courts have been no more willing than the Federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>courts to adopt a \u201cuniversal!]\u201d \u201cprivacy doctrine,\u201d <em>Marcoux </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>375 Mass. 63, 67 (1978), or to derive \u201ccontroversial \u2018new\u2019 rights from the Constitution.\u201d <em>Aime </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>414 Mass. 667, 674 n.10 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">What the <em>Griswold </em>Court found \u201crepulsive to the notions of privacy surrounding the marriage relationship\u201d was the prospect of \u201callow[ing] the police to search the sacred precincts of marital bedrooms for telltale signs of the use of contraceptives.\u201d <em>Griswold </em>v. <em>Connecticut, supra </em>at 485-486. See <em>Moe </em>v. <em>Secretary of Admin. &amp; Fin., </em>382 Mass. 629, 658 (1981), quoting L. Tribe, American Constitutional Law 924 (1978) (finding it \u201cdifficult to imagine a clearer case of bodily intrusion\u201d than being forced to bear a child). When Justice Goldberg spoke of \u201cmarital relations\u201d in the context of finding it \u201cdifficult to imagine what is more private or more intimate than a husband and wife\u2019s marital relations [hip],\u201d <em>Griswold </em>v. <em>Connecticut, supra </em>at 495 (Goldberg, J., concurring), he was obviously referring to sexual relations.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Similarly, in <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>123 S.

Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, </em>374 Mass. 5, 14 (1977) (solicitation of prostitution \u201cwhile in a place to which the public had access\u201d implicated no \u201cconstitutionally protected rights of privacy\u201d); <em>Marcoux </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., supra </em>at 68 (right to privacy, at most, protects conduct \u201climited more or less to the hearth\u201d). It does not intrude on any right that the plaintiffs have to privacy in their choices regarding procreation, an intimate partner or sexual relations.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The plaintiffs\u2019 right to privacy in such matters does not require that the State officially endorse their choices in order for the right to be constitutionally vindicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-9\">Although some of the privacy cases also speak in terms of personal autonomy, no court has ever recognized such an open-ended right. \u201cThat many of the rights and liberties protected by the Due Process Clause sound in personal autonomy does not warrant the sweeping conclusion that any and all important, intimate, and personal decisions are so protected . . . .\u201d <em>Washington </em>v. <em>Glucksberg, </em>521 U.S. 702, 727 (1997). Such decisions are protected not because they are important, intimate, and personal, but because the right or liberty at stake is \u201cso deeply rooted in our history and traditions, or so fundamental to our concept of constitutionally ordered liberty\u201d that it is protected by due process. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, the Supreme Court has concluded that while the decision to refuse unwanted medical treatment is fundamental, <em>Cruzan </em>v. <em>Director, Mo. Dep\u2019t of Health, </em>497 U.S. 261, 278 (1990), because it is deeply rooted in our nation\u2019s history and tradition, the equally personal and profound decision to commit suicide is not because of the absence of such roots. <em>Washington </em>v. <em>Glucksberg, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b390-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>While the institution of marriage is deeply rooted in the history and traditions of our country and our State, the right to marry someone of the same sex is not. No matter how personal or intimate a decision to marry someone of the same sex might be, the right to make it is not guaranteed by the right of personal autonomy.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">The protected right to freedom of association, in the sense of freedom of choice \u201cto enter into and maintain certain intimate human relationships,\u201d <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>United States Jaycees, </em>468 U.S. 609, 617 (1984) (as an element of liberty or due process rather than free speech), is similarly limited and unimpaired by the marriage statute. As recognized by the Supreme Court, that right affords protection only to \u201ccertain kinds of highly personal relationships,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 618, such as those between husband and wife, parent and child, and among close relatives, <em>id. </em>at 619, that \u201chave played a critical role in the culture and traditions of the Nation,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 618-619, and are \u201cdeeply rooted in this Nation\u2019s history and tradition.\u201d <em>Moore </em>v. <em>East Cleveland, </em>431 U.S. 494, 498-499, 503 (1977) (distinguishing on this basis between family and nonfamily relationships). Unlike opposite-sex marriages, which have deep historic roots, or the parent-child relationship, which reflects a \u201cstrong tradition\u201d founded on \u201cthe history and culture of Western civilization\u201d and \u201cis now established beyond debate as an enduring American tradition,\u201d <em>Wisconsin </em>v. <em>Yoder, </em>406 U.S. 205, 232 (1972); or extended family relationships, which have been \u201chonored throughout our history,\u201d <em>Moore </em>v. <em>East Cleveland, supra </em>at 505, same-sex relationships, although becoming more accepted, are certainly not so \u201cdeeply rooted in this Nation\u2019s history and tradition\u201d as to warrant such enhanced constitutional protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">Although \u201cexpressions of emotional support and public commitment\u201d have been recognized as among the attributes of marriage, which, <em>\u201c[tjaken together . . . </em>form a constitutionally protected marital relationship\u201d (emphasis added), <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Safley, </em>482 U.S. 78, 95, 96 (1987), those interests, standing alone, are not the source of a fundamental right to marry. While damage to one\u2019s \u201cstatus in the community\u201d may be sufficient harm to confer standing to sue, <em>Lowell </em>v. <em>Kowalski, </em>380 Mass. 663, 667 (1980), such status has never been recognized as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>fundamental right. See <em>Paul </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>424 U.S. 693, 701 (1976) (mere damage to reputation does not constitute deprivation of \u201cliberty\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">Finally, the constitutionally protected interest in child rearing, recognized in <em>Meyer </em>v. <em>Nebraska, </em>262 U.S. 390, 399 (1923); <em>Pierce </em>v. <em>Society of Sisters, </em>268 U.S. 510, 534-535 (1925); and <em>Care &amp; Protection of Robert, supra </em>at 58, 60, is not implicated or infringed by the marriage statute here. The fact that the plaintiffs cannot marry has no bearing on their independently protected constitutional rights as parents which, as with opposite-sex parents, are limited only by their continued fitness and the best interests of their children. <em>Bezio </em>v. <em>Patenaude, </em>381 Mass. 563, 579 (1980) (courts may not use parent\u2019s sexual orientation as reason to deny child custody).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">Because the rights and interests discussed above do not afford the plaintiffs any fundamental right that would be impaired by a statute Umiting marriage to members of the opposite sex, they have no fundamental right to be declared \u201cmarried\u201d by the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-9\">Insofar as the right to marry someone of the same sex is neither found in the unique historical context of our Constitution<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> nor compelled by the meaning ascribed by this court to the liberty and due process protections contained within it, should the court nevertheless recognize it as a fundamental right? The consequences of deeming a right to be \u201cfundamental\u201d are profound, and this court, as well as the Supreme Court, has been very cautious in recognizing them.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Such caution is required by separation of powers principles. If a right is found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>to be \u201cfundamental,\u201d it is, to a great extent, removed from \u201cthe arena of public debate and legislative action\u201d; utmost care must be taken when breaking new ground in this field \u201clest the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause be subtly transformed into the policy preferences of [judges].\u201d <em>Washington </em>v. <em>Glucksberg, </em>521 U.S. 702, 720 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">\u201c[T]o rein in\u201d the otherwise potentially unlimited scope of substantive due process rights, <em>id. </em>at 722, both Federal and Massachusetts courts have recognized as \u201cfundamental\u201d only those \u201crights and liberties which are, objectively, \u2018deeply rooted in this Nation\u2019s history and tradition,\u2019 <em>[Moore </em>v. <em>East Cleveland, supra </em>at 503] . . . and \u2018implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 720-721, quoting <em>Palko </em>v. <em>Connecticut, </em>302 U.S. 319, 325 (1937).

In the area of family-related rights in particular, the Supreme Court has emphasized that the \u201cConstitution protects the sanctity of the family precisely because the institution of the family is deeply rooted.\u201d <em>Moore </em>v. <em>East Cleveland, supra.</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">Applying this limiting principle, the Supreme Court, as noted above, declined to recognize a fundamental right to physician-assisted suicide, which would have required \u201creversing] centuries of legal doctrine and practice, and striking] down the considered policy choice of almost every State.\u201d <em>Washington </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number><em>Glucksberg, supra </em>at 723.

However, \u201c[t]he long history of a certain practice . . . and its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>acceptance as an uncontroversial part of our national and State tradition do suggest that [the court] should reflect carefully before striking it down.\u201d <em>Colo </em>v. <em>Treasurer &amp; Receiver Gen., </em>378 Mass. 550, 557 (1979). As this court has recognized, the \u201cfact that a challenged practice \u2018is followed by a large number of states ... is plainly worth considering in determining whether the practice \u201coffends some principle of justice so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kostka, </em>370 Mass. 516, 533 (1976), quoting <em>Leland </em>v. <em>Oregon, </em>343 U.S. 790, 798 (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">Although public attitudes toward marriage in general and same-sex marriage in particular have changed and are still evolving, \u201cthe asserted contemporary concept of marriage and societal interests for which [plaintiffs] contend\u201d are \u201cmanifestly [less] deeply founded\u201d than the \u201chistoric institution\u201d of marriage. <em>Matter of the Estate of Cooper, </em>187 A.D.2d 128, 133-134 (N.Y. 1993). Indeed, it is not readily apparent to what extent contemporary values have embraced the concept of same-sex marriage. Perhaps the \u201cclearest and most reliable objective evidence of contemporary values is the legislation enacted by the country\u2019s legislatures,\u201d <em>Atkins </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>536 U.S. 304, 312 (2002), quoting <em>Penry </em>v. <em>Lynaugh, </em>492 U.S. 302, 331 (1989). No State Legislature has enacted laws permitting same-sex marriages; and a large majority of States, as well as the United States Congress, have affirmatively prohibited the recognition of such marriages for any purpose. See P. Green-berg, State Laws Affecting Lesbians and Gays, National Conference of State Legislatures Legisbriefs at 1 (April/May 2001) (reporting that, as of May, 2001, thirty-six States had enacted \u201cdefense of marriage\u201d statutes); 1 U.S.C. \u00a7 7 (2000); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738C (2000) (Federal Defense of Marriage Act).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">Given this history and the current state of public opinion, as reflected in the actions of the people\u2019s elected representatives, it cannot be said that \u201ca right to same-sex marriage is so rooted in the traditions and collective conscience of our people that failure to recognize it would violate the fundamental principles of liberty and justice that lie at the base of all our civil and political institutions.

See <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Interscholastic Athletic Ass\u2019n, </em>378 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>Mass. 342, 357 (1979). Consistent with this purpose, we have construed the ERA to prohibit laws that advantage one sex at the expense of the other, but not laws that treat men and women equally, <em>id. </em>at 346-349 (assuming that \u201cseparate but equal\u201d treatment of males and females would be constitutionally permissible). The Massachusetts marriage statute does not subject men to different treatment from women; each is equally prohibited from precisely the same conduct. See <em>Baker </em>v. <em>State, </em>170 Vt. 194, 215 n.13 (1999) (\u201cthere is no discrete class subject to differential treatment solely on the basis of sex\u201d). Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, </em>374 Mass. 5, 16 (1977) (law prohibiting prostitution applied to both male and female prostitutes and therefore did not discriminate), and <em>Personnel Adm\u2019r of Mass. </em>v. <em>Feeney, </em>442 U.S. 256, 274-275 (1979) (declining to characterize veterans\u2019 preference as sex discrimination because it applied to both male and female veterans), with <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Interscholastic Athletic Ass\u2019n, supra, </em>and <em>Lowell </em>v. <em>Kowalski, </em>380 Mass. 663 (1980) (where statutes and rules at issue advantaged one sex over another).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">Of course, a statute that on its face treats protected groups equally may still harm, stigmatize, or advantage one over the other. Such was the circumstance in <em>Loving </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>388 U.S. 1 (1967), where the Supreme Court struck down a State statute that made interracial marriage a crime, as constituting invidious discrimination on the basis of race. While the statute purported to apply equally to whites and nonwhites, the Court found that it was intended and structured to favor one race (white) and disfavor all others (nonwhites). The statute\u2019s legislative history demonstrated that its purpose was not merely to punish interracial marriage, but to do so for the sole benefit of the white race. As the Supreme Court readily concluded, the Virginia law was \u201cdesigned to maintain White Supremacy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 11. Consequently, there was a fit between the class that the law was intended to discriminate against (nonwhite races) and the classification enjoying heightened protection (race).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">By contrast, here there is no evidence that limiting marriage to opposite-sex couples was motivated by sexism in general or a desire to disadvantage men or women in particular. Moreover, no one has identified any harm, burden, disadvantage, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>advantage accruing to either gender as a consequence of the Massachusetts marriage statute. In the absence of such effect, the statute limiting marriage to couples of the opposite sex does not violate the ERA\u2019S prohibition of sex discrimination.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">This conclusion is buttressed by the legislative history of the ERA, which was adopted by the voters on November 2, 1976, after being approved by constitutional conventions of the Legislature on August 15, 1973, (by a vote of 261-0) and May 14, 1975 (by a vote of 217-55).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">In anticipation of its adoption, the Legislature enacted and, on June 21, 1975, the Governor approved a \u201cResolve providing for an investigation and study by a special commission relative to the effect of the ratification of the proposed amendments to the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the Constitution of the United States prohibiting discrimination on account of sex upon the laws, business communities and public in the Commonwealth.\u201d Res. 1975, c. 26. One of the principal tasks of the commission was to catalog the aspects of the General Laws that would have to be amended for the statutory code to comply with the mandate of the proposed amendment that equality not be abridged on the basis of sex.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">On October 19, 1976, just before the general election at which the amendment was to be considered, the commission filed its Interim Report, which focused on the effect of the Massachusetts ERA on the laws of the Commonwealth. 1976 Senate Doc. No. 1689. A section of the report, entitled \u201cAreas Unaffected by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>Equal Rights Amendment,\u201d addressed some of the legal regimes that would <em>not </em>be affected by the adoption of the ERA. One such area was \u201cHomosexual Marriage,\u201d about which the commission stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-5\">\u201cAn equal rights amendment will have no effect upon the allowance or denial of homosexual marriages. The equal rights amendment is not concerned with the relationship of two persons of the same sex; it only addresses those laws or public-related actions which treat persons of opposite sexes differently. The Washington Court of Appeals has already stated that the equal rights amendment to its state constitution did not afford a basis for validating homosexual marriages. In Colorado, the attorney general has likewise issued an opinion that the state equal rights amendment did not validate homosexual marriage. There are no cases which have used a state equal rights amendment to either validate or require the allowance of homosexual marriages.\u201d (Footnotes omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b398-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 21-22.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">The views of the commission were reflected in the public debate surrounding the passage of the ERA that focused on gender equality. See, e.g., Referenda reviewed, Boston Globe, Nov. 1, 1976, at 26; Voters\u2019 guide on nine state referendum measures, Boston Herald American, Nov. 1, 1976, at 17. Claims that the ERA might be the basis for validating marriages between same-sex couples were labelled as \u201cexaggerated\u201d and \u201cunfounded.\u201d For example, before the vote, the Boston Globe published an editorial discussing and urging favorable action on the ERA. In making its case, it noted that \u201c[t]hose urging a no vote . . . argue that the amendment would . . . legitimize marriage between people of the same sex [and other changes]. In reality, the proposed amendment would require none of these things. Mass, ballot issues ... 1 Equal Rights Amendment. Boston Globe, Nov. 1, 1976, at 29. And in the aftermath of the vote, the Boston Globe heralded the electorate\u2019s acceptance of \u201cthe arguments of proponents that the proposal would not result <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>in many far-reaching or threatening changes.\u201d Referendums fared poorly, Boston Globe, Nov. 4, 1976, at 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">While the court, in interpreting a constitutional amendment, is not bound to accept either the views of a legislative commission studying and reporting on the amendment\u2019s likely effects, or of public commentary and debate contemporaneous with its passage, it ought to be wary of completely disregarding what appears to be the clear intent of the people recently recorded in our constitutional history. This is particularly so where the plain wording of the amendment does not require the result it would reach.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">C. <em>The marriage statute satisfies the rational basis standard. </em>The burden of demonstrating that a statute does not satisfy the rational basis standard rests on the plaintiffs. It is a weighty one. \u201c[A] reviewing court will presume a statute\u2019s validity, and make all rational inferences in favor of it. . . .

Opposite-sex couples can obtain a license and same-sex couples cannot. The granting of this license, and the completion of the required solemnization of the marriage, opens the door to many statutory benefits and imposes numerous responsibilities. The fact that the statute does not permit such licenses to be issued to couples of the same sex thus bars them from civil marriage. The classification is not drawn between men and women or between heterosexuals and homosexuals, any of whom can obtain a license to marry a member of the opposite sex; rather, it is drawn between same-sex couples and opposite-sex couples.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">2. <em>State purpose. </em>The court\u2019s opinion concedes that the civil marriage statute serves legitimate State purposes, but further investigation and elaboration of those purposes is both helpful and necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>Civil marriage is the institutional mechanism by which societies have sanctioned and recognized particular family structures, and the institution of marriage has existed as one of the fundamental organizing principles of human society.

Marriage has not been merely a contractual arrangement for legally defining the private relationship between two individuals (although that is certainly part of any marriage). Rather, on an institutional level, marriage is the \u201cvery basis of the whole fabric of civilized society,\u201d J.P. Bishop, Commentaries on the Law of Marriage and Divorce, and Evidence in Matrimonial Suits \u00a7 32 (1852), and it serves many important political, economic, social, educational, procreational, and personal functions.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">Paramount among its many important functions, the institution of marriage has systematically provided for the regulation of heterosexual behavior, brought order to the resulting procreation, and ensured a stable family structure in which children will be reared, educated, and socialized. See <em>Milford </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>7 Mass. 48, 52 (1810) (civil marriage \u201cintended to regulate, chasten, and refine, the intercourse between the sexes; and to multiply, preserve, and improve the species\u201d).

Admittedly, heterosexual intercourse, procreation, and child care are not necessarily conjoined (particularly in the modern age of widespread effective contraception and supportive social welfare programs), but an orderly society requires some mechanism for coping with the fact that sexual intercourse commonly results in pregnancy and childbirth. The institution of marriage is that mechanism.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">The institution of marriage provides the important legal and normative link between heterosexual intercourse and procreation on the one hand and family responsibilities on the other. The partners in a marriage are expected to engage in exclusive sexual relations, with children the probable result and paternity presumed. See G. L. c. 209C, \u00a7 6 (\u201ca man is presumed to be the father of a child . . . if he is or has been married to the mother and the child was bom during the marriage, or within three hundred days after the marriage was terminated by death, annulment or divorce\u201d). Whereas the relationship between mother and child is demonstratively and predictably created and recognizable through the biological process of pregnancy and childbirth, there is no corresponding process for creating a relationship between father and child.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Similarly, aside from an act of heterosexual intercourse nine months prior to childbirth, there is no process for creating a relationship between a man and a woman as the parents of a particular child. The institution of marriage fills this void by formally binding the husband-father to his wife and child, and imposing on him the responsibilities of fatherhood. See J.Q. Wilson, <em>supra </em>at 23-32. See also R Blumstein &amp; P. Schwartz, <em>supra </em>at 29; C.N. Degler, <em>supra </em>at 61; G. Douglas, <em>supra </em>at 223; S.L. Nock, <em>supra </em>at 7; L. Saxton, <em>supra </em>at 239-240, 242; M.A. Schwartz &amp; B.M. Scott, <em>supra </em>at 4-6; Wardle, <em>supra </em>at 781-796. The alternative, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>society without the institution of marriage, in which heterosexual intercourse, procreation, and child care are largely disconnected processes, would be chaotic.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">The marital family is also the foremost setting for the education and socialization of children. Children learn about the world and their place in it primarily from those who raise them, and those children eventually grow up to exert some influence, great or small, positive or negative, on society. The institution of marriage encourages parents to remain committed to each other and to their children as they grow, thereby encouraging a stable venue for the education and socialization of children. See P. Blumstein &amp; P. Schwartz, <em>supra </em>at 26; C.N. Degler, <em>supra </em>at 61; S.L. Nock, <em>supra </em>at 2-3; C. Lasch, <em>supra </em>at 81; M.A. Schwartz &amp; B.M. Scott, <em>supra </em>at 6-7. More macroscopically, construction of a family through marriage also formalizes the bonds between people in an ordered and institutional manner, thereby facilitating a foundation of interconnectedness and interdependency on which more intricate stabilizing social structures might be built. See M. Grossberg, Governing the Hearth: Law and Family in Nineteenth-Century America 10 (1985); C. Lasch, supra; L. Saxton, <em>supra </em>at 260; J.Q. Wilson, <em>supra </em>at 221.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">This court, among others, has consistently acknowledged both the institutional importance of marriage as an organizing principle of society, and the State\u2019s interest in regulating it. See <em>French </em>v. <em>McAnarney, </em>290 Mass. 544, 546 (1935) (\u201cMarriage is not merely a contract between the parties. It is the foundation of the family. It is a social institution of the highest importance. The Commonwealth has a deep interest that its integrity is not jeopardized\u201d); <em>Milford </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>7 Mass. 48, 52 (1810) (\u201cMarriage, being essential to the peace and harmony, and to the virtues and improvements of civil society, it has been, in all well-regulated governments, among the first attentions of the civil magistrate to regulate [it]\u201d). See also <em>Skinner </em>v. <em>Oklahoma, </em>316 U.S. 535, 541 (1942) (\u201cMarriage and procreation are fundamental to the very existence and survival of the [human] race\u201d); <em>Maynard </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>125 U.S. 190, 211 (1888) (marriage \u201cis an institution, in the maintenance of which in its purity the public is deeply interested, for it is the foundation of the family <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>and of society, without which there would be neither civilization nor progress\u201d); <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Ramsey, </em>114 U.S. 15, 45 (1885) (\u201cno legislation can be supposed more wholesome and necessary in the founding of a free, self-governing commonwealth . . . than that which seeks to establish it on the basis of the idea of the family, as consisting in and springing from the union for life of one man and one woman ... the sure foundation of all that is stable and noble in our civilization; the best guaranty of that reverent morality which is the source of all beneficent progress in social and political improvement\u201d); <em>Reynolds </em>v. <em>United States, </em>98 U.S. 145, 165 (1878) (\u201cUpon [marriage] society may be said to be built, and out of its fruits spring social relations and social obligations and duties, with which government is necessarily required to deal\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">It is undeniably true that dramatic historical shifts in our cultural, political, and economic landscape have altered some of our traditional notions about marriage, including the interpersonal dynamics within it,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> the range of responsibilities required of it as an institution,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and the legal environment in which it exists.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Nevertheless, the institution of marriage remains the principal weave of our social fabric. See C.N. Degler, <em>supra </em>at 61; A.J. Hawkins, Introduction, in Revitalizing the Institution of Marriage for the Twenty-First Century: An Agenda for Strengthening Marriage xiv (2002); C. Lasch, <em>supra </em>at 80; WJ. O\u2019Donnell &amp; D.A. Jones, Marriage and Marital Alternatives 1 (1982); L. Saxton, <em>supra </em>at 229-230, 260; M.A. Schwartz &amp; B.M. Scott, <em>supra </em>at 4; Wardle, <em>supra </em>at 777-780; J.Q. Wilson, <em>supra </em>at 28, 40, 66-67. A family defined by heterosexual marriage continues to be the most prevalent social structure into which the vast majority of children are bom, nurtured, and prepared for productive participation in civil society, see Children\u2019s Living Arrangements and Characteristics: March, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>2002, United States Census Bureau Current Population Reports at 3 (June, 2003) (in 2002, 69% of children lived with two married parents, 23% lived with their mother, 5% lived with their father, and 4% lived in households with neither parent present).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\">It is difficult to imagine a State purpose more important and legitimate than ensuring, promoting, and supporting an optimal social structure within which to bear and raise children. At the very least, the marriage statute continues to serve this important State purpose.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">3. <em>Rational relationship. </em>The question we must turn to next is whether the statute, construed as limiting marriage to couples of the opposite sex, remains a rational way to further that purpose. Stated differently, we ask whether a conceivable rational basis exists on which the Legislature could conclude that continuing to limit the institution of civil marriage to members of the opposite sex furthers the legitimate purpose of ensuring, promoting, and supporting an optimal social structure for the bearing and raising of children.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">In considering whether such a rational basis exists, we defer to the decision-making process of the Legislature, and must make deferential assumptions about the information that it might <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>consider and on which it may rely. See <em>Shell Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Revere, </em>383 Mass. 682, 688 (1981) (court considers \u201cevidence which <em>may </em>have been available to the Legislature\u201d [emphasis added]); <em>Slome </em>v. <em>Chief of Police of Fitchburg, </em>304 Mass. 187, 189 (1939) (\u201cany rational basis of fact that can be reasonably conceived\u201d may support legislative finding); <em>Mutual Loan Co. </em>v. <em>Martell, </em>200 Mass. 482, 487 (1909), aff\u2019d, 222 U.S. 225 (1911) (\u201cLegislature may be supposed to have known\u201d relevant facts).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">We must assume that the Legislature (1) might conclude that the institution of civil marriage has successfully and continually provided this structure over several centuries<footnotemark>22</footnotemark>; (2) might consider and credit studies that document negative consequences that too often follow children either bom outside of marriage or raised in households lacking either a father or a mother figure,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> and scholarly commentary contending that children and families <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>develop best when mothers and fathers are partners in their parenting<footnotemark>24</footnotemark>; and (3) would be familiar with many recent studies that variously support the proposition that children raised in intact families headed by same-sex couples fare as well on many measures as children raised in similar families headed by opposite-sex couples<footnotemark>25</footnotemark>; support the proposition that children of same-sex couples fare worse on some measures<footnotemark>26</footnotemark>; or reveal notable differences between the two groups of children that warrant further study.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">We must also assume that the Legislature would be aware of the critiques of the methodologies used in virtually all of the comparative studies of children raised in these different environments, cautioning that the sampling populations are not representative, that the observation periods are too limited in time,<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> that the empirical data are unreliable, and that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>hypotheses are too infused with political or agenda driven bias. See, e.g., R. Lemer &amp; A.K. Nagai, No Basis: What the Studies Don\u2019t Tell Us About Same-Sex Parenting, Marriage Law Project (Jan. 2001) (criticizing forty-nine studies on same-sex parenting \u2014 at least twenty-six of which were cited by amici in this case \u2014 as suffering from flaws in formulation of hypotheses, use of experimental controls, use of measurements, sampling and statistical testing, and finding false negatives); Stacey, (How) Does the Sexual Orientation of Parents Matter, 66 Am. Soc. Rev. 159, 159-166 (2001) (highlighting problems with sampling pools, lack of longitudinal studies, and political hypotheses).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">Taking all of this available information into account, the Legislature could rationally conclude that a family environment with married opposite-sex parents remains the optimal social structure in which to bear children, and that the raising of children by same-sex couples, who by definition cannot be the two sole biological parents of a child and cannot provide children with a parental authority figure of each gender,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> presents an alternative structure for child rearing that has not yet proved itself beyond reasonable scientific dispute to be as optimal as the biologically based marriage norm. See <em>Baker </em>v. <em>State, </em>170 Vt. 194, 222 (1999) (\u201cconceivable that the Legislature could conclude that opposite-sex partners offer advantages in th[e] area [of child rearing], although . . . experts disagree and the answer is decidedly uncertain\u201d). Cf. <em>Marcoux </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>375 Mass. 63, 65 (1978). Working from the assumption that a recognition of same-sex marriages will increase the number of children experiencing this alternative, the Legislature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>could conceivably conclude that declining to recognize same-sex marriages remains pmdent until empirical questions about its impact on the upbringing of children are resolved.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">The fact that the Commonwealth currently allows same-sex couples to adopt, <em>see Adoption of Tammy, </em>416 Mass. 205 (1993), does not affect the rationality of this conclusion. The eligibility of a child for adoption presupposes that at least one of the child\u2019s biological parents is unable or unwilling, for some reason, to participate in raising the child. In that sense, society has \u201clost\u201d the optimal setting in which to raise that child \u2014 it is simply not available. In these circumstances, the principal and overriding consideration is the \u201cbest interests of the child,\u201d considering his or her unique circumstances and the options that are available for that child. The objective is an individualized determination of the best environment for a particular child, where the normative social structure \u2014 a home with both the child\u2019s biological father and mother \u2014 is not an option. That such a focused determination may lead to the approval of a same-sex couple\u2019s adoption of a child does not mean that it would be irrational for a legislator, in fashioning statutory laws that cannot make such individualized determinations, to conclude generally that being raised by a same-sex couple has not yet been shown to be the absolute equivalent of being raised by one\u2019s married biological parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">That the State does not preclude different types of families from raising children does not mean that it must view them all as equally optimal and equally deserving of State endorsement and support.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> For example, single persons are allowed to adopt children, but the fact that the Legislature permits single-parent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>adoption does not mean that it has endorsed single parenthood as an optimal setting in which to raise children or views it as the equivalent of being raised by both of one\u2019s biological parents.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> The same holds true with respect to same-sex couples \u2014 the fact that they may adopt children means only that the Legislature has concluded that they may provide an acceptable setting in which to raise children who cannot be raised by both of their biological parents. The Legislature may rationally permit adoption by same-sex couples yet harbor reservations as to whether parenthood by same-sex couples should be affirmatively encouraged to the same extent as parenthood by the heterosexual couple whose union produced the child.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">In addition, the Legislature could conclude that redefining the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>institution of marriage to permit same-sex couples to marry would impair the State\u2019s interest in promoting and supporting heterosexual marriage as the social institution that it has determined best normalizes, stabilizes, and links the acts of procreation and child rearing. While the plaintiffs argue that they only want to take part in the same stabilizing institution, the Legislature conceivably could conclude that permitting their participation would have the unintended effect of undermining to some degree marriage\u2019s ability to serve its social purpose. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stowell, </em>389 Mass. 171, 175 (1983) (given State\u2019s broad concern with institution of marriage, it has \u201clegitimate interest in prohibiting conduct which may threaten that institution\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">So long as marriage is limited to opposite-sex couples who can at least theoretically procreate, society is able to communicate a consistent message to its citizens that marriage is a (normatively) necessary part of their procreative endeavor; that if they are to procreate, then society has endorsed the institution of marriage as the environment for it and for the subsequent rearing of their children; and that benefits are available explicitly to create a supportive and conducive atmosphere for those purposes. If society proceeds similarly to recognize marriages between same-sex couples who cannot procreate, it could be perceived as an abandonment of this claim, and might result in the mistaken view that civil marriage has little to do with procreation: just as the potential of procreation would not be necessary for a marriage to be valid, marriage would not be necessary for optimal procreation and child rearing to occur.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> In essence, the Legislature could conclude that the consequence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>of such a policy shift would be a diminution in society\u2019s ability to steer the acts of procreation and child rearing into their most optimal setting.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> <em>Hall-Omar Baking Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Labor &amp; Indus., </em>344 Mass. 695, 700 (1962) (\u201cLegislative classification is valid if it is rational and bears <em>some </em>relationship to the object intended to be accomplished\u201d [emphasis added]).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">The court recognizes this concern, but brushes it aside with the assumption that permitting same-sex couples to marry \u201cwill not diminish the validity or dignity of opposite-sex marriage,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 337, and that \u201cwe have no doubt that marriage will continue to be a vibrant and revered institution.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 340. Whether the court is correct in its assumption is irrelevant. What is relevant is that such predicting is not the business of the courts. A rational Legislature, given the evidence, could conceivably come to a different conclusion, or could at least <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>harbor rational concerns about possible unintended consequences of a dramatic redefinition of marriage.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">There is no question that many same-sex couples are capable of being good parents, and should be (and are) permitted to be so. The policy question that a legislator must resolve is a different one, and turns on an assessment of whether the marriage structure proposed by the plaintiffs will, over time, if endorsed and supported by the State, prove to be as stable and successful a model as the one that has formed a cornerstone of our society since colonial times, or prove to be less than optimal, and result in consequences, perhaps now unforeseen, adverse to the State\u2019s legitimate interest in promoting and supporting the best possible social structure in which children should be bom and raised. Given the critical importance of civil marriage as an organizing and stabilizing institution of society, it is eminently rational for the Legislature to postpone making fundamental changes to it until such time as there is unanimous scientific evidence, or popular consensus, or both, that such changes can safely be made.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">There is no reason to believe that legislative processes are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>inadequate to effectuate legal changes in response to evolving evidence, social values, and views of fairness on the subject of same-sex relationships.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> Deliberate consideration of, and incremental responses to rapidly evolving scientific and social understanding is the norm of the political process \u2014 that it may seem painfully slow to those who are already persuaded by the arguments in favor of change is not a sufficient basis to conclude that the processes are constitutionally infirm. See, e.g., <em>Massachusetts Fed\u2019n of Teachers </em>v. <em>Board of Educ., </em>436 Mass. 763, 778 (2002); <em>Mobil Oil </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>361 Mass. 401, 417 (1972) (Legislature may proceed piecemeal in addressing perceived injustices or problems). The advancement of the rights, privileges, and protections afforded to homosexual members of our community in the last three decades has been significant, and there is no reason to believe that that evolution will not continue. Changes of attitude in the civic, social, and professional communities have been even more profound. Thirty years ago, The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, the seminal handbook of the American Psychiatric Association, still listed homosexuality as a mental disorder. Today, the Massachusetts Psychiatric Society, the American Psychoanalytic Association, and many other psychiatric, psychological, and social science organizations have joined in an amicus brief on behalf of the plaintiffs\u2019 cause. A body of experience and evidence has provided the basis for change, and that body continues to mount. The Legislature is the appropriate branch, both constitutionally and practically, to consider and respond to it. It is not enough that we as Justices might be personally of the view that we have learned enough to decide what is best. So long as the question is at all debatable, it must be the Legislature that decides. The marriage statute thus meets the requirements of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>rational basis test. Accord <em>Standhardt </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>77 P.3d 451 (Ariz. Ct. App. 2003) (marriage statutes rationally related to State\u2019s legitimate interest in encouraging procreation and child rearing within marriage); <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Nelson, </em>291 Minn. 310, 313 (1971) (\u201cequal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, like the due process clause, is not offended by the state\u2019s classification of persons authorized to marry\u201d); <em>Singer </em>v. <em>Hara, </em>11 Wash. App. 247, 262-263 (1974) (\u201cThere can be no doubt that there exists a rational basis for the state to limit the definition of marriage to exclude same-sex relationships\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">D. <em>Conclusion. </em>While \u201c[t]he Massachusetts Constitution protects matters of personal liberty against government incursion as zealously, and often more so, than does the Federal Constitution,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 328, this case is not about government intrusions into matters of personal liberty. It is not about the rights of same-sex couples to choose to live together, or to be intimate with each other, or to adopt and raise children together. It is about whether the State must endorse and support their choices by changing the institution of civil marriage to make its benefits, obligations, and responsibilities applicable to them. While the courageous efforts of many have resulted in increased dignity, rights, and respect for gay and lesbian members of our community, the issue presented here is a profound one, deeply rooted in social policy, that must, for now, be the subject of legislative not judicial action.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b384-7\">The rational basis standard applied under the Massachusetts Constitution and the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution is the same.

It is fair to assume that most of the children affected by that ruling, who properly would be the subject of study in their teenage and adult years, are still only children today.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b408-8\">This family structure raises the prospect of children lacking any parent of their own gender. For example, a boy raised by two lesbians as his parents has no male parent. Contrary to the suggestion that concerns about such a family arrangement is based on \u201cstereotypical\u201d views about the differences between sexes, <em>ante </em>at 337 n.28, concern about such an arrangement remains rational. It is, for example, rational to posit that the child himself might invoke gender as a justification for the view that neither of his parents \u201cunderstands\u201d him, or that they \u201cdon\u2019t know what he is going tMough,\u201d particularly if Ms disagreement or dissatisfaction involves some issue pertaining to sex. Given that same-sex couples raising children are a very recent phenomenon, the ramifications of an adolescent cMld\u2019s having two parents but not one of his or her own gender have yet to be fully realized and cannot yet even be tested in significant numbers. But see note 25, <em>supra, </em>regarding studies of children raised without parents of each gender.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b409-7\">The same could be true of any other potentially promising but recent innovation in the relationships of persons raising children.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b409-8\">The plaintiffs also argue that because the State requires insurance companies to provide coverage for diagnosing and treating infertility unrestricted to those who are married, G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 47H, limiting marriage to opposite-sex couples is contrary to its currently stated public policy and, therefore, no longer rational. This argument is not persuasive. The fact that the Legislature has seen fit to require that health insurers cover the medical condition of infertility, for all subscribers, is not inconsistent with the State\u2019s policy of encouraging and endorsing heterosexual marriage as the optimum structure in which to bear and raise children. There is no rule that requires the State to limit every law bearing on birth and child rearing to the confines of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>heterosexual marriage in order to vindicate its policy of supporting that structure as optimal. Just as the insurance laws relating to infertility coverage cannot be said to be a State endorsement of childbirth out of wedlock, they cannot be said to represent an abandonment of the State\u2019s policy regarding a preference that children be bom into and raised in the context of heterosexual marriage.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b410-7\">Indeed, just recently, this court reasoned that the Legislature could permissibly conclude that children being raised by single parents \u201cmay be at heightened risk for certain kinds of harm when compared with children of so-called intact families,\u201d because such children \u201cmay not have or be able to draw on the resources of two parents\u201d when having to cope with some form of loss. <em>Blixt </em>v. <em>Blixt, </em>437 Mass. 649, 663, 664 (2002), cert, denied, 537 U.S. 1189 (2003). In that case, the differences between single parents and parents raising a child together sufficed to justify subjecting single parents to the grandparent visitation statute, G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 39D. <em>Id. </em>at 662-664. Because the statute implicated fundamental parental rights, its classifications had to survive strict scrutiny, <em>id. </em>at 660, not the mere rational basis test at issue in today\u2019s opinion. The fact that single people can adopt children did not insulate them from differential treatment with respect to their parental rights.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b410-8\">Similarly, while the fact that our laws have evolved to include a strong affirmative policy against discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, have decriminalized intimate adult conduct, and have abolished the legal distinctions between marital and nonmarital children, may well be a reason to celebrate a more open and humane society, they ought not be the basis on which to conclude that there is no longer a rational basis for the current marriage law. See <em>ante </em>at 332-333. To conclude the latter based on the former threatens the process of social reform in a democratic society. States must be free to experiment in the realm of social and civil relations, incrementally and without concern that a step or two in one direction will determine the outcome of the experiment as a matter of law. If they are not, those who argue \u201cslippery slope\u201d will have more ammunition than ever to resist any effort at progressive change or social experimentation, and will be able to put the lie to the arguments of the proponents of such efforts, that an incremental step <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>forward does not preordain a result which neither the people nor their elected representatives may yet be prepared to accept.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"34\">\n<p id=\"b411-7\">The court contends that the exclusive and permanent commitment of the marriage partnership rather than the begetting of children is the sine qua non of civil marriage, <em>ante </em>at 332, and that \u201cthe \u2018marriage is procreation\u2019 argument singles out the one unbridgeable difference between same-sex and opposite-sex couples, and transforms that difference into the essence of legal marriage.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 333. The court has it backward. Civil marriage is the product of society\u2019s critical need to manage procreation as the inevitable consequence of intercourse between members of the opposite sex. Procreation has always been at the root of marriage and the reasons for its existence as a social institution. Its structure, one man and one woman committed for life, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>reflects society\u2019s judgment as how optimally to manage procreation and the resultant child rearing. The court, in attempting to divorce procreation from marriage, transforms the form of the structure into its purpose. In doing so, it turns history on its head.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">The court compounds its error by likening the marriage statute to Colorado\u2019s \u201cAmendment 2,\u201d which was struck by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Romer </em>v. Evans, 517 U.S. 620, 633 (1996). That amendment repealed all Colorado laws and ordinances that barred discrimination against homosexuals, and prohibited any governmental entity from adopting similar statutes. The amendment withdrew from homosexuals, but no others, legal protection from a broad range of injuries caused by private and governmental discrimination, \u201cimposing a broad and undifferentiated disability on a single named group.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 632. As the Court noted, its sheer breadth seems \u201cinexplicable by anything but animus toward the class it affects.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The comparison to the Massachusetts marriage statute, which limits the institution of marriage (created to manage procreation) to opposite-sex couples who can theoretically procreate, is completely inapposite.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"35\">\n<p id=\"b412-8\">Although the marriage statute is overinclusive because it comprehends within its scope infertile or voluntarily nonreproductive opposite-sex couples, this overinclusiveness does not make the statute constitutionally infirm. See <em>Massachusetts Fed\u2019n of Teachers </em>v. <em>Board of Educ., </em>436 Mass. 763, 778 (2002) (\u201cSome degree of overinclusiveness or underinclusiveness is constitutionally permissible . . .\u201d). The overinclusiveness present here is constitutionally permissible because the Commonwealth has chosen, reasonably, not to test every prospective married couple for fertility and not to demand of fertile prospective married couples whether or not they will procreate. It is satisfied, rather, to allow every couple whose biological opposition makes procreation theoretically possible to join the institution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"36\">\n<p id=\"b413-7\">Concems about such unintended consequences cannot be dismissed as fanciful or far-fetched. Legislative actions taken in the 1950\u2019s and 1960\u2019s in areas as widely arrayed as domestic relations law and welfare legislation have had significant unintended adverse consequences in subsequent decades including the dramatic increase in children bom out of wedlock, and the destabilization of the institution of marriage.
