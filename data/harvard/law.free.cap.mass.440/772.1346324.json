We conclude that a reasonable belief is the proper standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-7\"><em>Background. </em>The defendant was charged in the Holyoke District Court with breaking and entering in the daytime with the intent to commit a felony (G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 18); possession of a class A drug with the intent to distribute (G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32); possession of a class A drug (G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 34); and a school zone violation (G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32J). Prior to trial, he filed a motion to suppress the heroin seized by the police in the course of arresting him in an apartment, alleging, inter aha, that \u201cthere was no probable cause to execute an arrest warrant and enter the premises.\u201d After an evidentiary hearing, the judge granted the defendant\u2019s motion. A single justice of this court allowed the Commonwealth\u2019s interlocutory appeal to the Appeals Court. We then granted the Commonwealth\u2019s application for direct appellate review. Because we conclude that the police, in executing a valid arrest warrant at the suspect\u2019s alleged residence, possessed the requisite reasonable belief that the suspect both lived in, and was present at, the residence, and there is no merit to the defendant\u2019s claims concerning violation of the \u201cknock and announce\u201d rule and the seizure of drugs at the residence, we reverse the motion judge\u2019s order allowing the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-8\"><em>Facts. </em>In reviewing the allowance of a motion to suppress, we will not disturb a judge\u2019s findings of fact absent clear error. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>433 Mass. 669, 670 (2001). We supplement the facts found by the motion judge with uncontroverted testimony of the police officers at the motion hearing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>430 Mass. 725, 726 n.5 (2000). We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>recognize that the sequence of events and some of the facts at first blush do not appear to make sense. However, these are, indeed, the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">The judge found that at approximately midday on November 16, 1999, a confidential informant told Detectives Kenneth Ferris and William Lempke<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of the Holyoke police department that three men were selling drugs through a hole in the wall of apartment no. 401 at 275 Main Street in Holyoke. The detectives were also informed that the apartment door was fortified. Lempke testified that, after receiving this information, the officers went to the apartment, knocked on the door that was ajar (the lock was broken) but secured by something behind it, and announced that they were the police. While Lempke remained in the hallway, Ferris went to the police station and telephoned the building owner. The building owner put the police in touch with the apartment building manager, who informed the police that Danny Acevedo was the sole lessee of apartment no. 401.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">The motion judge found that, after checking records, the police determined that there were several outstanding warrants for Acevedo\u2019s arrest. Penis and Detective Dennis Egan viewed Acevedo\u2019s photograph before going to the apartment. Ferris, Egan, and Officer Ron Mihalek then went to the apartment, but did not bring Acevedo\u2019s photograph with them. Approximately one hour after Lempke and Ferris first arrived at the apartment, the officers knocked on the door, which was barricaded, as the police later discovered, by three two-by-four inch boards and a full-size refrigerator. No one answered the door, but the officers heard movement and the toilet flushing inside the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-7\">Lempke was able to see inside the apartment through a two and one-half to three inch hole in a piece of plywood that, as the motion judge found, \u201capparently had been used to cover the apartment window.\u201d Through this hole, Lempke saw three men in the bathroom, including the defendant, whom Lempke thought to be Acevedo. Lempke did not have the opportunity to see Acevedo\u2019s photograph, because it had not been brought to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>the scene. Lempke based his identification on a very general description of Acevedo \u2014 Hispanic male, five feet, seven inches to five feet, eight inches tall, with facial hair \u2014 that he had gleaned from the building manager and from Acevedo\u2019s outstanding arrest warrants.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">Lempke told the other officers that he thought he saw Acevedo in the apartment. The officers testified that they knocked and announced that they were the police, but did not state that they had an arrest warrant for Acevedo. They then forced the apartment door open. The officers found the kitchen and the combination bedroom-living room empty. There was a smell of marijuana in the apartment. Egan tried to open the bathroom door, but the handle came off in his hand. However, the bathroom door opened and three men, including the defendant, walked out.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The police officers detained the men and placed them under arrest for breaking and entering.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">As the men were being secured, Lempke walked into the bathroom that he described as \u201ca very small\u201d room with a shower stall. Lempke saw \u201cthe end of a plastic bag in the bottom of the [toilet] bowl.\u201d The officers lifted the toilet off its foundation and discovered a plastic bag, which contained heroin. Acevedo was nowhere to be found.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-7\">The judge found that the officers never \u201cindicated to any defendant that they had a warrant for his arrest.\u201d The judge also found that the Commonwealth offered no evidence that the officers tried to ascertain whether the defendants had permission to be in the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-8\">\n<em>Discussion.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b795-9\">1. <em>Standard of review. </em>When reviewing the allowance of a motion to suppress, we give substantial deference to the judge\u2019s legal conclusions, but independently review the application of constitutional principles to the facts. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Torres, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>433 Mass. 669, 671-672 (2001). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jimenez, </em>438 Mass. 213, 218 (2002); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>375 Mass. 349, 354 (1978) (judge\u2019s legal conclusion \u201ca matter for review . . . particularly where the conclusion is of constitutional dimensions\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">2. <em>Reasonable belief. </em>The Commonwealth argues that the motion judge erred in holding that the police officers needed a search warrant even though the officers entered the apartment pursuant to a valid arrest warrant for the apartment\u2019s resident. According to the Commonwealth, when the police possess a valid arrest warrant for a suspect, art. 14, like the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution, only requires that the police have a \u201creasonable belief,\u201d as opposed to probable cause, that the suspect is inside his residence before the police may enter to make an arrest. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">An arrest warrant \u201cencompasses the power to enter a [suspect\u2019s] residence for the purpose of executing the warrant.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nova, </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. 633, 634-635 (2000). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pietrass, </em>392 Mass. 892, 897 (1984) (arrest warrant allows police to enter dwelling). A separate search warrant is not required. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Acosta, </em>416 Mass. 279, 281 (1993). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>28 Mass. App. Ct. 589, 592 (1990) (\u201cA person\u2019s home is not a castle against execution of a lawful arrest warrant directed against that person\u201d). Cf. <em>Steagald </em>v. <em>United States, </em>451 U.S. 204, 213 (1981) (separate search warrant required to enter third party\u2019s residence to execute arrest warrant).</p>\n<p id=\"b796-7\">The Supreme Court of the United States has held that for the purposes of the Fourth Amendment, \u201can arrest warrant founded on probable cause implicitly carries with it the limited authority to enter a dwelling in which the suspect lives where there is reason to believe the suspect is within.\u201d <em>Payton </em>v. <em>New York, </em>445 U.S. 573, 603 (1980). Most of the circuits of the United States Court of Appeals that have addressed this issue have agreed that, under the <em>Payton </em>decision, \u201cpolice officers entering a residence pursuant to an arrest warrant must demonstrate a reasonable belief that the arrestee lived in the residence, and a reasonable belief that the arrestee could be found within the residence at the time of the entry.\u201d <em>Valdez </em>v. <em>McPheters, </em>172 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>F.3d 1220, 1224 (10th Cir. 1999), and cases cited. Every Federal circuit court of the United States Court of Appeals that has addressed the issue, except the Ninth Circuit,* *<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> has held that the \u201creason to believe\u201d language was meant to employ a standard less exacting than probable cause.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The vast majority of State courts have followed suit.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">Whether art. 14 is more stringent than the Fourth Amendment is the issue of first impression. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>429 Mass. 620, 623-624 (1999) (whether \u201cart. 14 requires more than a reason to believe that the defendant was within the apart<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>ment to justify a forcible entry\u201d is \u201ca proposition that we do not reach\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DiBenedetto, </em>427 Mass. 414, 418 (1998) (\u201cThis court has not yet decided whether art. 14 . . . requires that police, with a valid arrest warrant, have more than reason to believe a suspect is in a dwelling\u201d). We conclude that art. 14, like the Fourth Amendment, requires that police with a valid arrest warrant have a reasonable belief that the location to be searched is the arrestee\u2019s residence, and a reasonable belief that the arrestee is in his residence at the time the arrest warrant is executed.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">Our holding is supported by the language of art. 14, practical considerations, and our <em>pre-Payton </em>decisions. Article 14 recognizes that \u201c[ejvery subject has a right to be secure from all unreasonable searches . . . of . . . his houses,\u201d and provides that warrants can be issued only if certain requirements are met. It does not specify, however, what level of certainty the police must have that the suspect is within his residence before entering to execute the arrest warrant. Accordingly, we conclude that the reasonableness requirement of the article\u2019s first line governs. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smigliano, All </em>Mass. 490, 499 &amp; n.2 (1998) (Fried, J., concurring) (\u201cReasonableness is . . . the touchstone of art. 14\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">Moreover, requiring probable cause would be overly burdensome, \u201cparticularly when it may be said that a set routine of looking for the defendant first within his own premises is generally sound.\u201d 3 W.R. LaFave, Search and Seizure \u00a7 6.1(a), at 228 (3d ed. 1996 &amp; Supp. 2003). <em>People </em>v. <em>Sprovieri, </em>95 Ill. App. 2d 10, 14-15, aff\u2019d, 43 Ill. 2d 223 (1969) (most \u201crudimentary police procedure dictates that a suspect\u2019s residence be eliminated as a possible hiding place before a search is conducted elsewhere\u201d). The \u201creasonable belief\u201d standard protects suspects against \u201cunreasonable searches\u201d because, where the police have a valid arrest warrant, an impartial magistrate has already found probable cause to believe that the suspect committed a crime. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>28 Mass. App. Ct. 589, 592 (1990) (\u201cThe determination by a judicial officer of probable cause [for the arrest warrant] acts as a screen between the overzealous official and the citizen\u201d). The \u201creasonable belief\u201d standard would allow the officer who has already <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>secured a valid arrest warrant to determine, while on the scene, and based on the information available at the time, whether the suspect is within his residence. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Route, </em>104 F.3d 59, 62 (5th Cir.), cert, denied, 521 U.S. 1109 (1997). Furthermore, this standard would prevent a person for whom an arrest warrant has issued from using his own residence as a haven. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Allen, supra.</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">This court has used a Payton-like reasonableness test well over a century before the United States Supreme Court adopted a comparable standard as a matter of Federal law. In <em>Barnard </em>v. <em>Bartlett, </em>10 Cush. 501, 503 (1852), we essentially adopted a reasonableness standard when we said that an officer who enters a dwelling to serve criminal process on an occupant is \u201cjustified, if the officer acted bona fide, and under a <em>belief </em>that the [person] was there\u201d (emphasis added). A few years later, this court used the term \u201creasonable,\u201d mandating that the officer have a \u201creasonable cause to believe\u201d that the subject of the arrest warrant is within the residence. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Irwin, </em>1 Allen 587, 589 (1861). This \u201creasonable cause to believe\u201d test gained acceptance in later cases and has never been disavowed. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>120 Mass. 190, 196 (1876) (\u201can officer who, holding a warrant against an alleged offender, has reasonable cause to believe that he is within such house, [may] forcibly enter[]\u201d). <em>Blatt </em>v. <em>McBarron, </em>161 Mass. 21, 22 (1894) (officer may enter third person\u2019s home in search of subject of arrest warrant if officer has \u201creasonable cause to believe\u201d that suspect is there).</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">The defendant attempts to distinguish these cases<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and claims that their validity has been cast into doubt by <em>Steagald </em>v. <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number><em>States, </em>451 U.S. 204, 222 (1981), where the Court held that police must obtain a separate search warrant before entering a third party\u2019s residence to execute an arrest warrant. However, because the <em>Steagald </em>decision concerned only the authority of the police, under the Fourth Amendment, to enter a third person\u2019s home, the portions of our earlier cases pertaining to a suspect\u2019s own residence remain undisturbed, leaving the \u201creasonable belief\u201d standard intact.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">The police did not have probable cause to believe that Acevedo was in the apartment. However, they did have a \u201creasonable belief\u201d that apartment no. 401 was Acevedo\u2019s dwelling, and that Acevedo was within that dwelling at the time the officers sought to execute an arrest warrant. The building manager informed the officers that Acevedo was the sole lessee, \u201cactively paying rent at that time.\u201d On their arrival at apartment no. 401, the police noted that the door was ajar, implying that someone was within. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DiBenedetto, All </em>Mass. 414, 417 (1998) (\u201cthe fact that the police found that the . . . door was ajar justified an expectation that someone was likely to be there\u201d). The police could also tell that the door was barricaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">Additionally, the police looked through the hole and \u201cobserved activity in the apartment . . . that suggested the occupant was home.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Acosta, </em>416 Mass. 279, 282 (1993). Furthermore, the police made a tentative identification of Acevedo before entering the apartment \u2014 Lempke looked into the hole and concluded that he saw Acevedo based on the description he obtained from the building manager and from the arrest warrants. That the person Lempke saw turned out to be the defendant does not render Lempke\u2019s belief that he saw Acevedo unreasonable.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>United States </em>v. <em>Risse, </em>83 F.3d 212, 216 (8th Cir. 1996) (\u201cthe officers\u2019 assessment need not in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>fact be correct\u201d). Considering all the circumstances, the police had a reasonable belief that Acevedo rented the apartment and was within it at the time they sought to execute the arrest warrant.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The police entry was, therefore, lawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">3. <em>Knock and announce. </em>The defendant contends that the police violated the requirement that they \u201cknock and announce\u201d before entering an apartment to execute an arrest warrant.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> However, the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress made no mention of the \u201cknock and announce\u201d issue, and the defendant never requested permission to amend his motion. Nor was the issue adequately raised during the suppression hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">A motion to suppress \u201cshall state the grounds on which it is based and shall include in separately numbered paragraphs all reasons, defenses, or objections then available, which shall be set forth with particularity.\u201d Mass. R. Crim. R 13 (a) (2), 378 Mass. 871 (1979).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robles, </em>48 Mass. App. Ct. 490, 491 n.1 (2000). This requirement alerts the judge and the Commonwealth to the suppression theories at issue, and allows the Commonwealth to limit its evidence to these theories. There is no reason for the Commonwealth to extend unnecessarily the length of the suppression hearing by presenting evidence on issues not raised by the defense. When a defendant attempts to raise a new issue after the completion of the hearing\u2019s evidentiary phase, the evidence on that issue is likely to be \u201cscant\u201d or nonexistent. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>429 Mass. 620, 623 (1999). Therefore, the doctrine of waiver precludes the defendant from raising a fresh issue after the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>close of the evidence. See <em>id., </em>and cases cited (waiver doctrine precludes defendant who did not properly alert motion judge to issue from raising it on appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">In his motion to suppress, the defendant contended that \u201c(1) there were no factors to justify a threshold inquiry; (2) there was no probable cause for the search; (3) there was no search warrant; and (4) there was no probable cause to execute an arrest warrant and enter the premises.\u201d The motion made no mention of any failure to knock and announce prior to entry. The Commonwealth focused its evidence accordingly. Relying on snippets of questions and arguments made by counsel for the codefendant, and on defense counsel\u2019s adoption of \u201call of the issues mentioned by [his] brother attorney\u201d after the close of the evidence, the defendant claims that the \u201cknock and announce\u201d issue, although not set forth in his motion, was \u201cspecifically identified\u201d during the suppression hearing. However, the transcript does not support this assertion. The codefendant\u2019s counsel\u2019s comments were made in the context of an argument concerning the officers\u2019 alleged shortcomings in identifying Acevedo, and not as part of a \u201cknock and announce\u201d argument.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> These \u201cbrief commentfs] by [cojdefense counsel in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>his argument to the motion judge in support of the suppression motion did not adequately raise the issue.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ruggerio, </em>32 Mass. App. Ct. 964, 965 (1992). Because the defendant did not properly alert the judge to the \u201cknock and announce\u201d argument, the waiver doctrine precludes him from doing so on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">4. <em>Destruction of evidence. </em>Even had the defendant properly preserved the issue, the result would be no different. The requirement that the police knock, identify themselves, and announce their purpose \u201c[bjefore attempting forcibly to enter a private dwelling to execute a warrant,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Antwine, </em>417 Mass. 637, 638 (1994), may be suspended where necessary to \u201cavoid the potential destruction of evidence.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Macias, </em>429 Mass. 698, 701 (1999). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jimenez, </em>438 Mass. 213, 216 (2002) (failure to knock and announce justified where there is \u201cfear that a substantial portion of the evidence . . . might be destroyed or secreted\u201d). To justify the unannounced entry, the Commonwealth must show that there is probable cause to believe that the evidence will be destroyed if the knock and announce rule is observed. <em>Id. </em>at 216-217. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Scalise, </em>387 Mass. 413, 420 (1982). This showing must be made in advance in an affidavit submitted to the magistrate together with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>warrant application. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jimenez, supra. </em>The showing may also be made after the fact, \u201cif exigent circumstances arise at the threshold of the search [or arrest] justifying both the unannounced entry and the failure to obtain prior judicial authorization.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 217. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Scalise, supra </em>at 422 n.8.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">In deciding whether enough facts were present to amount to probable cause to believe that the evidence would be destroyed, we \u201cdo not examine each fact in isolation, but rather we examine all of the facts together.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>West, </em>55 Mass. App. Ct. 467, 470 (2002). Even several factors \u201cinnocent of themselves,\u201d when combined, may amount to probable cause. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fisher, </em>54 Mass. App. Ct. 41, 44 (2002). The police officers\u2019 expertise and experience may be considered as a factor in the probable cause determination. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>West, supra. </em>See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Feijoo, </em>419 Mass. 486, 498 (1995) (officer\u2019s experience in investigating child abuse is factor supporting probable cause).</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">In this case, the police knocked and identified themselves, but did not state their purpose before forcibly entering apartment no. 401. That failure to announce their purpose was justified by the officers\u2019 concern about the imminent destruction of the evidence. Here, the confidential informant told the police that drugs were being sold out of the apartment, one of the officers looked through the hole in the wall and saw three men in the bathroom, and when the police knocked and identified themselves, they heard movement and a toilet flushing inside the apartment. Considering these facts and reasonable inferences drawn from them, we conclude that the entry was supported by probable cause to believe that the extra time afforded the occupants of the apartment \u201cwould allow a significant additional portion of the evidence sought to be destroyed.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Macias, supra </em>at 703.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-7\">The continuing concern about the destruction of evidence also justified police entry into the bathroom and search of the toilet.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Having heard the flushing sounds, the police could have had legitimate concerns that evidence was being destroyed, with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>perhaps only a brief period of time before all traces would be eliminated by the operation of the plumbing system. The officers were entitled to seize the plastic bag to prevent the destruction of evidence. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DeJesus, </em>439 Mass. 616, 624 n.8 (2003). The police properly used their expertise in investigating narcotics violations, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Franco, </em>419 Mass. 635, 637 (1995), in deducing that the plastic bag found in the toilet contained contraband: the informant spoke of drug dealing, the apartment door was barricaded, the police heard scurrying and flushing of the toilet inside the apartment (which, the officers knew, was a common method of disposing of narcotics), and on entering the apartment, the police smelled marijuana. Lempke\u2019s extensive training and special expertise in narcotics investigations further support the conclusion that the contraband nature of the contents of the plastic bag was immediately apparent to him. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cruz, </em>53 Mass. App. Ct. 24, 34-35 (2001) (object\u2019s criminal nature may be immediately apparent where special expertise permits officer to recognize contraband). The fact that Lempke could not see heroin in the bag \u201cis all but irrelevant: the distinctive character of the [bag] itself spoke volumes as to its contents \u2014 particularly to [his] trained eye.\u201d <em>Texas </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>460 U.S. 730, 743 (1983). Once the officers discovered the bag, they were entitled to remove it from the toilet bowl and seize it.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\"><em>Conclusion. </em>For the reasons set forth above, we hold that art. 14 requires that police, with a valid arrest warrant, have a reasonable belief that the location to be searched is the suspect\u2019s residence, and that the suspect is in his residence at the time the arrest warrant is executed. Furthermore, the defendant waived the \u201cknock and announce\u201d argument, but even if he did not, the entry into the apartment and into the bathroom was justified by the \u201cdestruction of evidence\u201d exception. We also conclude that</p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>the police properly seized the plastic bag they discovered in the bathroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">The order allowing the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress is reversed.

The police are already familiar with a similar standard of \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d based on \u201cspecific and articulable facts\u201d used in <em>Terry-type </em>investigatory stops. <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1 (1968).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b799-8\">The defendant argues that the cases cited by the Commonwealth do not control, because they concern only the right of the police to enter \u201cinto the house of a third party for the purpose of enforcing an arrest warrant.\u201d The defendant is incorrect. In <em>Barnard </em>v. <em>Bartlett, </em>10 Cush. 501, 503 (1852), the court explicitly dealt with the suspect\u2019s \u201cown dwelling-house.\u201d It is irrelevant that later cases employed the \u201creasonable cause to believe\u201d standard to police entries into third parties\u2019 homes. At that time, the standard was the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>regardless of whether the police sought entry into the suspect\u2019s or a third person\u2019s home. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>120 Mass. 190, 196 (1876).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b800-8\">The defendant contends that the police were unreasonable in relying on Lempke\u2019s identification of the defendant as Acevedo, because better practice would have been for the police to bring Acevedo\u2019s photograph to the scene. However, the fact that the police could have brought Acevedo\u2019s photograph with them or had Ferris or Detective John Collamore (both of whom saw the booking photographs of Acevedo at the police station) look through the hole and identify Acevedo does not mean that the police were unreasonable in relying on Lempke\u2019s identification.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b801-7\">The defendant argues that the police actions after they entered the apartment indicated that they did not believe that Acevedo was within. However, the test to determine the propriety of the entry considers only the circumstances known to the police at the time of the entry into the residence. <em>Valdez </em>v. <em>McPheters, </em>172 F.3d 1220, 1227 (10th Cir. 1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b801-8\">Except in certain limited circumstances, the police \u201cmust knock, identify themselves, and state their purpose before entering a dwelling to execute an arrest warrant.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>28 Mass.

He went on to argue that the police were lax in their verification, complaining that the officers did not know Acevedo\u2019s skin complexion, were \u201coff by a couple of inches\u201d on his height, and never asked the occupants of the apartment if Acevedo was among them:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-13\">\u201cThe way that the person wasn\u2019t described as a [inaudible] he says somewhere between five feet, six inches or five feet, seven inches, or five feet, eight inches, the person is five feet, nine inches. So, he\u2019s off <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>by a couple of inches possibly on that. He had no idea about skin complexion. And they never announced who they\u2019re looking for.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-7\">\u201cIf [they] announce and say police, you don\u2019t have to answer the door. The police have no special right just because they are police for you to open the door and say, \u2018hello, how are you?\u2019 If they have a search warrant, then you have to let them in. If they say, \u2018a warrant for Daniel Acevedo.\u2019 And someone in the back says Danny Acevedo was not there, then you might have something more. But they didn\u2019t even announce why they were there, judge.
