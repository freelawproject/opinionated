He filed a motion for a new trial, which was later revised, and denied. His appeal from the denial of his motion for a new trial has been consolidated with his direct appeal. Also before us is the trial judge\u2019s refusal to consider the defendant\u2019s amended motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">On appeal, the defendant claims that he is entitled to a new trial because (1) the Commonwealth lost the victim\u2019s clothing; (2) the judge improperly interfered with the cross-examination of a Commonwealth witness; (3) the judge improperly accepted a witness\u2019s invocation of the privilege against self-incrimination; (4) the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument was based on speculation and facts not in evidence; and (5) the judge committed error in various instructions. He also alleges error in (6) the denial of his motion for a new trial, which alleged ineffective assistance of counsel; (7) the judge\u2019s refusal to consider his amended motion for a new trial; and (8) the imposition of a duplicative sentence. Finally, he asks us to exercise our power under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, to reverse his murder conviction. Except for one conviction of armed robbery, which also served as the predicate felony for the murder conviction, we affirm the convictions and decline to exercise our power under \u00a7 33E to reduce the degree of guilt or grant a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">1. <em>Background. </em>On June 25, 1994, the defendant and Jamal Butler agreed to rob an unspecified drug dealer later that day. The defendant brought a friend with him to the designated meeting place. The three men went to the home of Butler\u2019s girl friend, where Butler paged the victim, Ryan Edwards, whom he knew, and knew to be a cocaine dealer. Edwards\u2019s brother, Alfred Clarke, answered the page and passed the telephone to Edwards. The defendant tried to arrange to buy some cocaine, but Edwards refused to deal because he did not know the defendant. Following a brief argument, the defendant hung up. Butler paged the victim a second time and spoke with Clarke, who knew him. Butler arranged for the defendant to buy one ounce of cocaine from Edwards for $850 at the McDonald\u2019s restaurant on Warren Street in the Roxbury section of Boston, where the parties agreed to meet within one-half hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>At the McDonald\u2019s parking lot, Butler entered Edwards\u2019s car and sat in the back seat. Edwards was in the driver\u2019s seat and Clarke sat in the front passenger seat. Edwards showed Butler the cocaine and Butler said that he was \u201cgoing to get my man,\u201d meaning the defendant, who was to deliver the money. Butler returned to the defendant\u2019s car and told him to \u201cgo handle his business.\u201d The defendant went over to Edwards\u2019s car and sat in the rear seat. Edwards drove out of the parking lot onto Warren Street because he was concerned about being seen by security personnel. The defendant pulled out a gun and said, \u201cKeep driving or I\u2019ll kill both of you.\u201d He ordered Clarke to turn over his cash, pager, and the bracelet he was wearing. He then ordered Clarke to get out of the car. Edwards pulled over and Clarke got out. As the car drove off, Clarke heard a gunshot and saw a flash inside the car. He waved down a police cruiser and told the officers, \u201cThey shot my brother.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b681-4\">At some point the defendant got out of Edwards\u2019s car. Edwards eventually stopped his car in a parking area on Albert Street, approximately five blocks from the McDonald\u2019s restaurant, and \u201crevv[ed]\u201d the engine. An off-duty Boston police officer who was visiting a nearby home heard two gunshots and saw Edwards\u2019s car pull into the parking area. He went outside to investigate. Edwards told him that he had been shot. The officer telephoned 911. Edwards told the responding officer that he had been shot by someone outside the car. Edwards was taken to Boston City Hospital, where he died a short time later. An autopsy revealed that a single bullet entered Edwards\u2019s body about six inches below his right armpit, traveling nearly straight across his torso, slightly downward, through his diaphragm, liver, aorta, and left kidney, causing death. Because Edwards\u2019s clothing had been lost by hospital personnel, it could not be determined whether he had been shot at close range.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">The next day the defendant gave Butler one-half the cocaine he took from Edwards. He also admitted that he shot Edwards. When Butler asked why, the defendant said that he wanted \u201cto make it look good.\u201d A shell casing found on the front passenger seat of Edwards\u2019s car had been discharged from a .25 caliber automatic weapon. The bullet recovered from Edwards\u2019s body was consistent with a .25 caliber bullet. The murder weapon was never found.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>The defense seized on Edwards\u2019s words to the effect that he had been shot by someone outside the car; the testimony of the off-duty officer who heard two shots fired; and the fact that Edwards\u2019s clothing had been lost and could not be analyzed for the presence of gun powder residue to determine whether Edwards had been shot at close range. The defense also tried to depict Butler and Clarke as unworthy of belief, based on their involvement with drugs, their criminal records, prior inconsistent statements, and possible motives to lie. Defense counsel also implied that Clarke might have killed Edwards with a .25 caliber handgun he owned.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">2. <em>Lost evidence. </em>The defendant argues that he is entitled to a reversal of his murder conviction and a dismissal of the indictment because the Commonwealth failed to preserve Edwards\u2019s clothing, thereby depriving him of a fair trial and the opportunity to present evidence favorable to his cause. The defendant raises the issue for the first time on appeal, so we consider whether any error caused a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cintron, </em>438 Mass. 779, 783-784 n.2 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">Detective John Brazil had gone to the emergency room at Boston City Hospital shortly after the shooting to recover Edwards\u2019s clothing, but the clothing was nowhere to be found. Because the clothing was never in the possession of the prosecutor or the police, there was no breach of duty for which the Commonwealth may be held responsible. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Donahue, </em>396 Mass. 590, 596 (1986), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Liebman, </em>379 Mass. 671, 675 (1980). There has been no showing that medical personnel at Boston City Hospital were members of the prosecutor\u2019s staff or had \u201cparticipated in the investigation or evaluation of the case and who either regularly report or with reference to the particular case have reported to his office.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Woodward, </em>427 Mass. 659, 679 (1998), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>St. Germain, </em>381 Mass. 256, 261-262 n.8 (1980). Where the evidence shows only that Detective Brazil attempted to secure the clothing but was unable to obtain it for reasons not attributable to him, the Commonwealth is not culpable for the loss and should not be sanctioned. Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Donahue, supra </em>at 599-602. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>loss of the evidence did not prevent the defendant from arguing that Edwards had been shot from outside the car, but instead allowed him to make the argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">3. <em>Interference with cross-examination. </em>The defendant contends that the judge improperly interfered with his right to cross-examine a Commonwealth witness, Judith Richards, in violation of his rights under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights. There was no objection, and the defendant acknowledges that the standard of review is whether any error created a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">Richards, the sister of Clarke and Edwards, had testified that approximately one month after Edwards was killed, she discovered a gun in the attic, activated the safety, placed the gun in a lunch box, and then threw the lunch box in the trash. The Commonwealth had offered this testimony to explain what happened to the .25 caliber handgun Clarke said he acquired after Edwards was killed. On cross-examination, Richards was asked what kind of gun she threw out, and answered that she could not remember. Defense counsel held up a .38 caliber semiautomatic handgun and a .25 caliber automatic handgun and asked which gun more closely resembled the one she threw out. The judge interrupted and said, \u201cWe don\u2019t want you to guess, though. If you don\u2019t have a memory, just tell us, please.\u201d Richards answered that she did not remember.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">The judge did not improperly limit the defendant\u2019s right to cross-examine the witness, and he did not guide the witness\u2019s testimony or put words in her mouth, as the defendant argues. The right to cross-examine is not absolute, but is subject to the judge\u2019s broad discretion. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jordan, </em>439 Mass. 47, 55 (2003) (cross-examination calling for speculation properly excluded). The witness said she could not remember what type of gun it was. Defense counsel\u2019s next question was improper for two reasons: it assumed a fact (that the witness had a memory of the type of gun she discarded) not in evidence, see <em>Reardon </em>v. <em>Boston Elev. Ry., </em>311 Mass. 228, 231 (1942), and it was confusing because it asked the witness to testify <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>about something for which she said she had no memory.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The judge properly allowed Richards to answer after satisfying himself that she understood that her responsibility was to answer based on her memory, and not on speculation. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hoffer, </em>375 Mass. 369, 376 (1978); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 14, 19 (1997) (judge, in refusing to permit defense counsel to show social worker\u2019s report to nine year old witness, could reasonably conclude that witness would not likely understand that document was only being used to refresh her recollection). A judge may properly participate in the questioning of a witness so long as the questioning is not partisan in nature. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Festa, 369 </em>Mass. 419, 422 (1976), and cases cited. There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">The defendant also contends that the judge improperly \u201crescued\u201d the Commonwealth when he questioned the relevance of defense counsel\u2019s effort to ascertain the identity of the person who had shown Richards how to activate the safety of a handgun and excluded evidence of that person\u2019s identity. The judge did not preclude all inquiry on the subject. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Doherty, </em>394 Mass. 341, 349 (1985). Richards had said that it was not a family member. Defense counsel admitted he did not know the relevance of that person\u2019s identity. The judge nevertheless permitted counsel to inquire if the person was either Clarke or Edwards, and the witness said it was neither. A judge has discretion to exclude irrelevant evidence, sua sponte, provided he does not exhibit bias in the process. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Haley, </em>363 Mass. 513, 516-519 (1973), <em>S.C., </em>413 Mass. 770 (1992). No bias was exhibited, and the judge properly acted within his discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">The judge\u2019s folksy send-off for Richards at the conclusion of her testimony, in which he thanked her and wished her well in college, should not have been said, but it did not create a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. The judge had treated other witnesses in a similar fashion, including defense witnesses. The absence of an objection suggests the lack of any prejudice from the judge\u2019s practice, and refutes the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>claim on appeal that the judge was endorsing Richards\u2019s testimony. Moreover, Richards was not a key witness, and the judge told the jury in his final instruction that he was \u201ctotally neutral,\u201d and that nothing he had said or done during the trial should be construed as an indication that he had an opinion about the facts of the case. There was no substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">4. <em>Invocation of privilege against self-incrimination by Andrew Neals. </em>Clarke had testified that \u201ca couple of days\u201d after the murder he traded his .38 caliber handgun to Andrew Neals for a .25 caliber automatic handgun. The defendant called Neals to testify about the swap to cast doubt on the credibility of Clarke\u2019s testimony, and to explore the possibility that Clarke may have had the gun on the day of the murder. Neals invoked his privilege against self-incrimination during a voir dire. The judge accepted Neals\u2019s claim of privilege and excused him from testifying. The defendant objected, arguing that Neals had waived the privilege by pleading guilty to \u201ca firearm offense.\u201d He also produced a copy of Neals\u2019s criminal record.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">\u201cA witness may refuse to testify unless it is \u2018 <em>\u201cperfectly clear, </em>from a careful consideration of all the circumstances in the case, that the witness is mistaken, and that the answer[s] <em>cannot possibly </em>have such tendency\u201d to incriminate\u2019 (emphasis in original).\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Funches, </em>379 Mass. 283, 289 (1979), quoting <em>Hoffman </em>v. <em>United States, </em>341 U.S. 479, 488 (1951). Although, as the defendant argues, the record does not show the judge\u2019s reason for accepting Neals\u2019s exercise of the privilege, the basis is plain from the record. Neals\u2019s criminal record indicates that he pleaded guilty to illegal possession of only one firearm. However, there were two firearms involved in the alleged swap. Thus, he was entitled to invoke the privilege as to possession of the second firearm. In addition, evidence of the unlicensed trading of firearms exposed Neals to a prosecution of at least one violation of G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 128. There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">5. <em>Prosecutor\u2019s closing argument. </em>The defendant contends that there was no record support for certain statements made by the prosecutor in his closing, and that the prosecutor improperly speculated about the defendant\u2019s motive to shoot Edwards. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>There was record support for the prosecutor\u2019s assertion that the defendant had spoken to Edwards over the telephone and had argued with him before Butler finalized arrangements for the drug sale. Although there was no direct evidence that the defendant told Edwards he \u201cwant[ed] to deal,\u201d as the prosecutor stated, it was clear both that the prosecutor was drawing an inference, and that the purpose of the conversation was to arrange a drug sale. The prosecutor\u2019s dramatization of the imagined course of that conversation was restrained and consistent with reasonable inferences drawn from the evidence. It was permissible. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pope, </em>406 Mass. 581, 587 (1990). The defendant\u2019s claim that the prosecutor improperly argued that he telephoned a second drug dealer is meritless. The prosecutor made no such statement. He argued that Butler made the telephone call.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">The prosecutor posited three possible motives for the shooting, each of which was based on reasonable inferences drawn from the evidence. The prosecutor explicitly presented his theories to the jury as possible scenarios, not as fact, and he also correctly added that evidence of motive was not a necessary element of proof. The argument was not improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">6. <em>Jury instructions, </em>a. Ciampa <em>instruction. </em>Butler testified pursuant to a written plea agreement with the Commonwealth. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ciampa, </em>406 Mass. 257 (1989). The defendant contends that the judge did not instruct the jury that they could not consider Butler\u2019s guilty plea as evidence against the defendant. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Prater, </em>431 Mass. 86, 98 (2000) (\u201cThe better practice would have been for the judge to have provided a specific instruction that the jury should not consider an accomplice\u2019s guilty plea as evidence against [the defendant]\u201d). There was no objection to the lack of the instruction, so we review to determine if any error caused a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\"><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Prater, supra, </em>was decided after the trial of this case, and left open the question whether failure to instruct the jury that they may not consider evidence of the accomplice\u2019s guilty plea as evidence against the defendant constitutes error. <em>Id. </em>at 98. We need not decide the question here because there was no evidence that Butler had pleaded guilty. Thus, there was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>no guilty plea for the jury to consider and no basis for the judge to have given the instruction in question.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">b. <em>Judge\u2019s inflection. </em>The defendant objected to the inflection and the slower speaking pace used by the judge in the instruction on reasonable doubt, which the defendant argues diminished the Commonwealth\u2019s burden of proof, and in the instruction on credibility of witnesses, which he claims suggested that the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses were credible. The judge ordered a copy of the tape recording used by the official court reporter to be included in the record on appeal, and he authenticated the recording. We have listened to the tape, and we discern nothing improper in this case about the judge\u2019s inflection, or the pace of his speech during those portions of the instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">We consider the judge\u2019s instructions in their entirety. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cundriff, </em>382 Mass. 137, 153 (1980), cert, denied, 451 U.S. 973 (1981), and cases cited. Although the judge did stress certain points by inflection or a slower pace, he did not suggest any diminution of the Commonwealth\u2019s burden of proof, or suggest that the jury should believe the Commonwealth witnesses. His use of inflection and a slower speaking pace stressed important concepts, some of which were favorable to the defendant. Some inflection may be desirable to maintain interest and to avoid the obvious negative effects that might flow from speaking in a monotone. The judge\u2019s delivery was appropriately neutral.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">Moreover, the judge instructed the jury that he was \u201ctotally neutral\u201d and had no opinion about how the case should be decided. The jury acquitted the defendant of deliberately premeditated murder and murder with extreme atrocity or cruelty, something that would not likely have occurred if the judge\u2019s inflection had been prejudicial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hogan, </em>426 Mass. 424, 433 (1998), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Keniston, </em>423 Mass. 304, 310-311 (1996). There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>c. <em>Felony-murder instruction. </em>At the beginning of the felony-murder instruction the judge told the jury that they could find the defendant guilty of murder in the first degree if the Commonwealth \u201chas proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant unlawfully killed the victim\u201d in the commission or attempted commission of certain felonies. Continuing, the judge instructed that \u201cthe Commonwealth must prove the following three elements beyond a reasonable doubt. One, that there was an unlawful killing; two, that the killing was committed while the defendant was in the course of committing or attempting to commit a felony punishable by imprisonment for life; and three, that under the circumstances of this case, the defendant committed or attempted to commit the felony with the conscious disregard for human life.\u201d The defendant focuses on the absence of any instruction, other than the judge\u2019s initial statement, indicating that the Commonwealth must prove that the unlawful killing was committed by the defendant, and he contends that the instruction permitted the jury to convict the defendant of felony-murder if he committed or attempted to commit an armed robbery of Edwards even if someone else had killed Edwards.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">A defendant need not commit an unlawful killing to be responsible for murder in the first degree under the felony-murder theory, even if the Commonwealth does not proceed under a theory of joint venture. As long as the unlawful killing occurs in connection with the predicate felony, and at substantially the same time and place, it does not matter that the defendant did not kill the victim: he is responsible for murder. The judge\u2019s instruction on felony-murder was consistent with the model jury instructions. See Model Jury Instructions on Homicide 15 (1999). If Edwards had died of fright while the defendant was robbing him, the defendant would be responsible for murder. The defendant received an instruction more favorable than he was entitled to receive, in that the judge instructed the jury that the Commonwealth must prove that the defendant actually killed Edwards.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">d. <em>Instruction on murder in the second degree. </em>The judge concluded his instruction on murder in the second degree by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>incorrectly stating that, if the Commonwealth has failed to prove murder in the first degree but has proved murder in the second degree, \u201cyou should find the defendant guilty of murder in the first degree.\u201d The defendant objected. The judge did not correct his mistake.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">A reasonable juror would have understood that the judge\u2019s misstatement was a slip of the tongue, because the instruction otherwise makes no sense in the context of the entire set of instructions. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cowels, </em>425 Mass. 279, 288 (1997). The judge\u2019s instructions concerning completion of the verdict slip directed the jury to select either not guilty, guilty of murder in the first degree, or guilty of murder in the second degree. He further instructed that, if they found the defendant guilty of murder in the first degree, to indicate on the verdict slip each theory for which the Commonwealth had met its burden of proof. In light of this instruction, a reasonable juror could not have understood that his or her duty would be to find the defendant guilty of a particular theory of murder in the first degree that had not been proved, if only murder in the second degree had been proved. The error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">7. <em>Motion for a new trial. </em>The defendant argued in his motion for a new trial that counsel was ineffective for fading to call a pathologist and a balhstician who would have provided evidence at trial that the defendant did not fire the fatal shot. He also claimed that counsel was ineffective for failing to provide the defendant with accurate information about the Commonwealth\u2019s intentions to impeach him if he elected to testify, and that as a result of that misinformation the defendant\u2019s waiver of his right to testify was not knowing and voluntary. The motion for a new trial was denied, and the defendant\u2019s motion for reconsideration was also denied, both by the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">\u201cA motion for new trial is addressed to the sound discretion of the judge, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>381 Mass. 141, 142 (1980), and the judge\u2019s disposition of the motion will not be reversed unless it is manifestly unjust, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Little, </em>384 Mass. 262, 269 (1981), [rev\u2019d on other grounds, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Santos, </em>402 Mass. 775, 788 (1988)]; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Leavitt, </em>21 Mass. App. Ct. 84, 86 (1985), or unless the trial was infected with prejudicial constitutional error. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>383 Mass. 253, 257 (1981). Reversal for abuse of discretion is particularly rare where the judge acting on the motion was also the trial judge. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Leavitt, supra </em>at 85. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>13 Mass. App. Ct. 1085 (1982).\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Schand, </em>420 Mass. 783, 787 (1995), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>408 Mass. 117, 125 (1990). When reviewing questions of ineffective assistance of counsel under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, we consider \u201cwhether there was an error in the course of the trial (by defense counsel, the prosecutor, or the judge), and, if there was, whether that error was likely to have influenced the jury\u2019s conclusion.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>411 Mass. 678, 682 (1992). Where the claim of ineffectiveness involves a tactical decision of defense counsel, we inquire whether the decision was \u201cmanifestly unreasonable\u201d when made. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Adams, 374 </em>Mass. 722, 728 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">a. <em>Failure to call experts. </em>Trial counsel filed an affidavit stating that his decision not to call the pathologist or the ballistician he had retained before trial \u201cwas not based alone on [the defendant\u2019s] best interest,\u201d and \u201c[p]art of the reason for not asking these witnesses to testify was not wanting to anger them\u201d because testifying would interfere with their Thanksgiving vacation plans. Although counsel did not disclose any other tactical reason, his affidavit makes clear that he had other reasons. We review under the \u201cmanifestly unreasonable\u201d standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">It is clear from the affidavit of the defense pathologist that he would have offered nothing to detract from the testimony of the Commonwealth\u2019s pathologist, and he would have added nothing to the defense. The Commonwealth\u2019s pathologist opined that, without Edwards\u2019s clothing, it could not be determined whether the shot that killed Edwards had been fired within two feet. He also opined that the absence of any gunpowder residue or stippling in the wound left open a possibility that the fatal shot had been fired from a distance of at least two feet. The defense pathologist indicated that the absence of residue in the wound suggested that it was a \u201cdistant\u201d gunshot wound, without specifying. The defense ballistician indicated in his affidavit that two feet was the approximate distance that residue might be detected. The defense pathologist\u2019s opinion was generally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>consistent with that of the Commonwealth\u2019s pathologist, and the defense ballistician\u2019s opinion was cumulative of the opinion of the Commonwealth\u2019s pathologist. The failure to produce evidence that is essentially cumulative of the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence does not justify a new trial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grace, </em>397 Mass. 303, 305-306 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">The defense ballistician\u2019s affidavit contained opinions beyond his field of expertise that concerned the feasibility of firing a gun from different locations inside and outside the car, matters for which the jury needed no expert to assist them. Moreover, by acknowledging that a passenger in the rear seat of the car could drape his right arm over the front passenger seat to deliver the fatal shot, the ballistician actually bolstered the Commonwealth\u2019s case. He also failed to consider whether the shot could have been fired between the front bucket seats of Edwards\u2019s two-door Honda Prelude automobile as Edwards turned to surrender the drugs to the defendant in the rear seat. Thus, calling the ballistician might have been risky. The record indicates that there were tactical reasons, not manifestly unreasonable, why counsel might not have called the ballistician, including the ballistician\u2019s support of the testimony of the Commonwealth\u2019s pathologist.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">b. <em>Failure properly to advise. </em>The defendant contends that trial counsel was ineffective because he gave faulty advice about the Commonwealth\u2019s ability to impeach him, if he testified, and that the defendant\u2019s waiver of his right to testify was thus not knowing and voluntary. A defendant has the burden of proving that his waiver of his right to testify was invalid. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Freeman, </em>29 Mass. App. Ct. 635, 641-642 (1990). He must \u201cprove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that, but for his counsel\u2019s erroneous advice concerning the admissibility of his [criminal] record, he would have testified in his own defense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 642, citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jordan, </em>207 Mass. 259, 275 (1911), aff'd, 225 U.S. 167 (1912). It is not enough to say that counsel had discouraged him from testifying. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>438 Mass. 766, 776-777 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">Trial counsel filed a motion in limine to preclude the Commonwealth from impeaching the defendant with a prior conviction of attempted murder on a theory of joint venture. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>defendant filed an affidavit in support of his motion for a new trial in which he stated that he told counsel that he had been acquitted of the charge, but that counsel advised him that the judge ruled that he could be impeached with the conviction. The record reflects that counsel must have realized his mistake because, during the hearing on the motion in limine, he correctly described the conviction which he sought to have excluded as an armed assault under a theory of joint venture. The defendant was present during the hearing on the motion. The judge denied the motion in limine and stated his reasons in open court, in the presence of the defendant. The judge rejected the defendant\u2019s affidavit filed in support of the new trial motion as not credible. Trial counsel\u2019s affidavit in support of the new trial motion did not indicate any willingness to accept fault for allegedly misadvising the defendant on the impeachment issue, and given that he had accepted some fault in the same affidavit as to the claimed ineffectiveness for not calling two expert witnesses to testify, the judge could have construed this as an indication that the motion for a new trial was without merit as to the impeachment issue. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>426 Mass. 657, 665-666 (1998); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Savage, </em>51 Mass. App. Ct. 500, 505 n.6 (2001) (\u201cConspicuously absent was an affidavit from trial counsel supporting the defendant\u2019s contention\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">The defendant also alleged in his affidavit in support of his motion for a new trial that defense counsel failed to advise him that the prosecutor agreed during a sidebar conference that he would not introduce a prior conviction of armed robbery. In rejecting the defendant\u2019s allegation, the judge noted that, after the prosecutor stated that he would not use the prior armed robbery conviction, he \u201cwitnessed defense counsel go back and speak for a matter of minutes with the defendant at counsel table. Thereupon the defendant and his counsel and the [prosecutor] approached side bar, where the Court conducted a colloquy with the defendant regarding his rights to testify or not to testify.\u201d The judge was entitled to reject summarily any claim supported only by the defendant\u2019s self-serving affidavits, and infer from his own observation of the defendant and counsel at trial that they were conferring over precisely the matter the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>defendant now claims was never discussed. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Degro, </em>432 Mass. 319, 337 (2000); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Savage, supra </em>at 505. There was no abuse of discretion or other error in the denial of the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">8. <em>Amended motion for a new trial. </em>The judge declined to consider the defendant\u2019s amended motion for a new trial, which raised two new issues. His reason was that, because the defendant\u2019s direct appeal was pending, and because the first motion for a new trial had been decided and an appeal had been taken therefrom, he was without jurisdiction to consider the amended motion. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">General Laws c. 278, \u00a7 33E, states in part: \u201cAfter the entry of the appeal in a capital case and until the filing of the rescript by the supreme judicial court motions for a new trial shall be presented to that court and shall be dealt with by the full court, which may itself hear and determine such motions or remit the same to the trial judge for hearing and determination.\u201d The defendant\u2019s first motion for a new trial was correctly filed with this court, then remitted to the judge, who decided the motion. After the defendant appealed from the denial of his motion for a new trial, the Superior Court was without jurisdiction to take further action on that motion without authorization from this court. See G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cronk, </em>396 Mass. 194, 197 (1985). The amended motion had not been filed in this court, as required by \u00a7 33E, and this court did not authorize the trial judge to determine the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">Because the original motion had been determined, the amended motion for a new trial, which alleged two new claims, was essentially a second motion for a new trial. A defendant may not defeat the gatekeeper provision of \u00a7 33E simply by filing amended motions for a new trial with the Superior Court. The judge correctly declined to consider the defendant\u2019s amended motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-8\">9. <em>Duplicative conviction. </em>The defendant correctly argues that his conviction of the armed robbery of Ryan Edwards is duplicative as the underlying felony of his murder conviction, and must be vacated. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>425 Mass. 685, 692 (1997). The Commonwealth does not dispute this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>issue. However, the conviction of the armed robbery of Clarke may stand, as it is not duplicative of the felony-murder conviction. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Paulding, </em>438 Mass. 1, 13 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">10. <em>G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. </em>We see no reason to exercise our power under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, to reduce the verdict or order a new trial. The convictions are affirmed, except for the conviction on indictment numbered 94-11067-003, count one, alleging armed robbery of Ryan Edwards, which is hereby vacated. That indictment is remanded to the Superior Court for dismissal. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Paulding, supra. </em>The orders denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b684-7\">Tt would have been appropriate for counsel first to ask whether either gun refreshed the witness\u2019s recollection as to what type of gun she threw out.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b687-8\">Although the prosecutor improperly stated in his closing argument that Butler had pleaded guilty (there was no evidence to support the argument), there was no objection and the issue was not raised on appeal. We are satisfied that this portion of the argument did not create a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice because the prosecutor did not suggest that the judge\u2019s acceptance of Butler\u2019s plea was somehow a certification of its accuracy or an endorsement of Butler\u2019s truthfulness.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b688-7\">The Commonwealth did not proceed under a theory of joint venture, and a joint venture instruction was not given.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
