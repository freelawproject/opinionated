All of the reasons alleged for granting leave to appeal are clearly without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">The first allegation, concerning the sufficiency of the evidence, is not supported by the record. The reports of the director of Patuxent and a psychiatrist of the applicant\u2019s own choice show him to be a defective delinquent under the statutory tests. Since the opinions of expert witnesses in a case such as this should be accorded serious consideration, the sufficiency of the evidence to support the determination of the lower court is manifest. <em>Muhly v. Director, </em>234 Md. 624; <em>Williams v. Director, 232 </em>Md. 632.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">The second contention that there was evidence of rehabilitation goes to the weight of the evidence, as distinguished from its sufficiency, and is not available as a ground for leave to appeal. <em>Cooper v. Director, </em>234 Md. 622; <em>Faulkner v. Director, </em>230 Md. 632.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">The third claim, to the effect that the director\u2019s conclusions were based on the reports of staff members who were not available as witnesses, was rejected in <em>McCloskey v. Director, </em>230 Md. 635. See also <em>Schultz v. Director, 227 </em>Md. 666; <em>Fairbanks v. Director, </em>226 Md. 661.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-8\">The fourth contention, concerning the alleged inattention of the lower court, is an unsupported conclusion of the applicant and is insufficient to constitute a ground for relief. Cf. <em>Kiah v. Warden, </em>232 Md. 653.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-9\">\n<em>Application denied.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
