The church was not lived in or connected to any dwelling house. Entrance had been gained by breaking a window. The appellant, when arrested, readily admitted his entry and attempt to remove the safe.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-11\">The appellant contends that there is no crime of common law burglary of a church, and that since proof of breaking and entering a church in the night time does not establish the offense of common law burglary, there is a fatal variance. Code (1957), Art. 27, sec. 29, does not attempt to define the term \u201cburglary\u201d but merely fixes the penalty. <em>Bowser v. State, </em>136 Md. 342, 346. Nor is there anything in the statutes dealing with breaking and entering in the daytime, or into enumerated structures, at variance with the common law crime. Thus, the question before us concerns the common law. Since we have no prior decision on the point, we must look to the common law of England. In <em>State v. Buchanan, </em>5 H. &amp; J. 317, 358 (1821), Judge Buchanan, for the Court, noted that the statement in our Declaration of Rights (then Article 3, now Article 5) that \u201cthe Inhabitants of Maryland are entitled to the Common Law of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>England * * *\u201d had reference to the \u201ccommon law in mass, as it existed here, either potentially, or practically, and as it prevailed in England at the time, except such portions of it as are inconsistent with the spirit of that instrument, and the nature of our new political institutions.\u201d He went on to say that no part should be excluded \u201cmerely because it had not been introduced and used in the courts here,\u201d and that decisions in England subsequent to the separation must be \u201creceived as expositions of the law as it before existed, and not as creating a new law, or altering the old one, which could only be done by legislative enactment. * * * Precedents therefore do not constitute the common law but serve only to illustrate principles.\u201d See also <em>Knee v. Baltimore Passenger Ry. Co., </em>87 Md. 623, 624 and <em>Turner v. Wash. San. Com., </em>221 Md. 494, 503.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">The oldest case on the subject seems to be <em>Anon, </em>1 Dyer 99a (1553), Easter Term, 1 Queen Mary reported in 73 Eng. Rep., Reprint 216, where the indictment read: \u201cburglariously breaking open a church by night to steal the goods of the parishioners.\u201d \u201cAnd Bromely held clearly that this is burglary; but he said it ought to be <em>broke </em>and <em>entered.\u201d </em>In 79 Eng. Rep. Reprint 1160 and 1169 (Popham, 36 Eliz.) it is reported that on two occasions all the Justices resolved that it was burglary to break and enter a church. Coke was Attorney General at the time. A burglary indictment involving a church was sustained in <em>Regina v. Nicholas, </em>1 Cox C.C. 218 (1845), and in <em>Regina v. Baker, </em>3 Cox C.C. 581 (1849), Alderson B. said: \u201cI take it to be settled law that burglary may be committed in a church at common law.\u201d The writers agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">Lord Coke in his third institute (1817 ed.) p. 64 says: \u201cIf a man do break and enter a church in the night, of intent to steal * * * this is burglary, for <em>ecclesia est domus mansionalis omnipotentis Dei.\u201d </em>Lord Hale in his Pleas of the Crown (1st Am. ed. 1847), 556, remarked that this was \u201conly a quaint turn,\u201d and noted that \u201cthe breaking of churches, the walls or the gates of a city is also burglary, and the word <em>mansionalis </em>is only applicable to one kind of burglary, <em>viz., </em>the breaking of a private-house, in which case it must be a dwelling-house.\u201d In 4 Blackstone, <em>Commentaries </em>(Christian ed.), 224, the learned author cites Coke, but relies on the statement in 1 Hawkins, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>P.C. 133. See particularly Britton (Nichols trans. 1901), 36 (originally published in the early 14th century). See also 2 East, P.C. (1806), 491; 1 Russell, <em>Crimes and Misdemeanors </em>(7th Am. ed.), 785; Bishop, <em>Commentaries </em>(5th ed.), \u00a7 106; Hochheimer, <em>Criminal Law </em>(2d ed.), \u00a7 276; Clark &amp; Marshall, <em>Crimes </em>(5th ed.), \u00a7 406; 2 Pollock &amp; Maitland, <em>History of English Law </em>(2d ed.), pp. 492-93; 12 C.J.S., <em>Burglary, </em>\u00a7 25; 9 Am. Jur., <em>Burglary, </em>\u00a7 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">American cases seem to be few, but see <em>People v. Richards, </em>15 N. E. 371 (N. Y.), for a clear recognition of the common law rule. See also <em>Wilson v. State, </em>34 Ohio 199, and <em>Trevino v. State, </em>254 S. W. 2d 786 (Tex. Crim. App.). In 2 Wharton, <em>Criminal Law </em>(12th ed.), \u00a7 996, the author says: \u201cIt has been said that a church edifice may be the subject of burglary at common law [citing authorities]; but this has been doubted [citing 1 Hawkins, <em>supra, </em>and <em>People v. Richards, supra].\u201d </em>We venture to comment that the only doubt expressed has been as to the reason for the rule. We have found no authority denying that the rule existed at common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">On the point of variance we think the allegation regarding the church was sufficiently definite to apprise the accused of the offense with which he was charged, and prevent another prosecution for the same offense. Cf. <em>Hutson v. State, </em>202 Md. 333, 338, and <em>Leet v. State, </em>203 Md. 285, 289. The reference to \u201cdwelling house\u201d may be regarded as surplusage. It is not incumbent upon the State to prove averments not necessary to a statement of the crime charged. In any event, the ambiguity, if any, should have been resolved through pretrial procedure under Rule 725 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">Finally, the appellant contends that he was prejudiced by a reference in the charge to the jury, wherein the trial court referred to the reason for the rule as stated by Ford Coke \u201cin his \u2018quaint way\u2019 as it is said.\u201d He argues that a reference to the \u201cdwelling house of Almighty God\u201d contravenes the Fourteenth Amendment, citing <em>Torcaso v. Watkins, </em>367 U. S. 488, <em>Engel v. Vitale, </em>370 U. S. 421, and <em>Abington School Dist. v. Schempp, </em>374 U. S. 203. We find nothing in the cases cited to prevent counsel, or the Court, from discussing the point at issue or its historical origin, whether this involved a reference <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>to God or not. The appellant\u2019s argument that the \u201ctheory that a church is the dwelling house of God * * * cannot be presented in our courts without violating constitutional principles\u201d is, we think wholly without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
