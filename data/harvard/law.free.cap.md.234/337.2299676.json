Our examination of the extract and our consideration of the earnest and detailed arguments of counsel for the appellant, both printed and forensic, leaves us convinced that the persuasion of the trial judge, after a fourteen-day trial, that the husband and his paramour had both the inclination to commit adultery and ample opportunity to indulge that inclination and had done so, had a sufficient probative basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-18\"><em>Decree </em>affirmed, <em>with costs.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
