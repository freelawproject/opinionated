The first allegation, concerning the sufficiency of the evidence, is not supported by the record. The report of the director of the institution as well as the report of his own psychiatrist were to the effect that the applicant was a defective delinquent within the meaning of the statute, and the jury was entitled to rely on such evidence. We have repeatedly held that the opinions of expert witnesses in defective delinquent cases should be accorded serious consideration. See <em>Cooper v. Director, </em>234 Md. 622, and the cases therein cited. The second contention relates to and bears solely on the weight of the evidence and is not available as a ground for leave to appeal. <em>Cooper v. Director, supra. </em>The third claim, absent a statement as to the nature of the evidence withheld and why or how the withholding of it was prejudicial to the applicant, merely states the conclusion of the applicant and is therefore an insufficient basis for granting leave to appeal. <em>Faulkner v. Director, </em>230 Md. 632, 187 A. 2d 473 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-11\">\n<em>Application denied.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
