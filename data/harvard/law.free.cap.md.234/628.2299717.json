The trial court stated that this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>amounted to no more than an irregularity during trial, which could not be raised in a Post Conviction proceeding. The statement is too broad. His trial antedated the decision in <em>Mapp v. Ohio, </em>367 U. S. 643, which materially changed the law of this State relative to the admissibility of evidence obtained as the result of an illegal search or seizure.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">We heard a direct appeal in this case. <em>Davis, et al. v. State, </em>225 Md. 45. For the reasons stated by Judge Henderson in <em>Davis v. Warden, </em>232 Md. 670, we hold that Tiller\u2019s arrest was lawful, and the search incident thereto was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">\n<em>Application denied.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
