He did not appeal, but in October 1963 filed a petition under the Post Conviction Procedure Act, listing the following seven grounds for relief :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-15\">1. he was advised and induced by a police officer to waive his preliminary hearing ;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-17\">2. his \u201cindictment was not a true bill\u201d as it was procured by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>a single police officer who appeared before the grand jury and rendered hearsay evidence;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-5\">3. one of the persons who testified before the trial court committed perjury (the evidence was only taken in regard to Mullen\u2019s sentence, as he had pleaded guilty) ;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-7\">4. a police officer, who was present in court when the alleged false statements were being made, knew them to be untrue but made no effort to contradict them;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-9\">5. police officers gave false testimony before the court and beat him to educe a confession from him;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-11\">6. the police perpetrated an illegal search and seizure of his apartment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-13\">7. his counsel acted not in his \u201cbest interest\u201d when he advised him to plead guilty to murder in the second degree.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b676-15\">All of the above contentions were examined carefully and dismissed on factual bases by Judge Parker, who conducted the hearing on Mullen\u2019s petition, and we adopt the reasons given by him in his opinion for rejecting them as unsubstantial.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-16\">Mullen seems to have claimed also that he was illegally arrested (although in an oblique way, as he included the contention in the concluding portion of his application). This supposed irregularity, if true or material, was waived by the applicant\u2019s guilty plea, <em>Thomas v. Warden, </em>233 Md. 607, 608, and <em>Case v. State, </em>228 Md, 551, 554, and, additionally, Judge Parker found that \u201c [t] here is no evidence of an illegal search and seizure.\u201d See <em>Young v. Warden, </em>233 Md. 597, 599.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-17\">In his application for leave to appeal, Mullen says (1) that counsel who represented him at his hearing did not protect his \u201crights as guaranteed under the United States Constitution,\u201d and (2) he has never received any \u201ccourt records\u201d requested, and he appends a \u201cPetition for Transcript and all Court Records\u201d to his application. The petition asks that there be delivered to him twenty-one different items, a few of which are: \u201ccopy of the swearing in of grand jury\u201d; \u201ccopy of defendant\u2019s criminal record, both state and federal\u201d; and \u201ccopy of photograph taken of myself in Police headquarters, Prince George\u2019s County, October 11,1962.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b677-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>In view of Judge Parker\u2019s extensive opinion, the applicant\u2019s first allegation in his application is groundless, and we think that no useful purpose could be served by furnishing him the numerous records he has requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">\n<em>Application denied.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
