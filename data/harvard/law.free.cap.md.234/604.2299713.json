He alleges that a number of witnesses testified in his favor, and the State produced only Dr. Boslow, who testified that he was emotionally unstable, without control over his behavior, but not psychotic.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-14\">The contentions are wholly without merit. In addition to Dr. Boslow\u2019s testimony, Dr. Lerner, whom the applicant chose to examine him, filed a report stating that the applicant \u201cfits the description of a defective delinquent in accordance with State law.\u201d This expert also spoke of the patient\u2019s \u201ctendency toward paranoid ideation,\u201d a \u201cpropensity towards criminal activity, and considerable emotional unbalance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b624-15\">The testimony of experts in this field is entitled to serious consideration. <em>Palmer v. State, </em>215 Md. 142, 152. In view of the fact that the problem is fundamentally a medical one, the testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>mony of character witnesses is not controlling. We think the evidence was sufficient to support the finding of the trial court, and the matter of weight was for the trier of facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">\n<em>Application denied.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
