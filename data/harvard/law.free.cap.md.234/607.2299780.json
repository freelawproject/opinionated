Leek was convicted of rape but acquitted of perverted practice by a jury in the Criminal Court of Baltimore. He took an appeal and the judgment was affirmed. <em>Leek v. State, </em>229 Md. 526. Now he has applied for leave to appeal from the denial of post conviction relief by Judge Allen.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-15\">In his petition filed in the Criminal Court of Baltimore on December 31, 1962, Leek listed the following grounds for relief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>1\u2014 there was no evidence before the trial magistrate to establish a <em>prima jade </em>case</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-6\">2\u2014 the State\u2019s examining physician did not appear before the magistrate or the grand jury</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-8\">3\u2014 the trial court did not have jurisdiction to try the case</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-9\">A \u2014 evidence was insufficient to convict</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-10\">5\u2014 the <em>corpus delicti </em>was not proven by the State</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-11\">6\u2014 his conviction was based on perjured testimony</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-12\">7\u2014 the State suppressed evidence</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-13\">8\u2014 he was denied the right to testify in his own behalf</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-14\">9\u2014 his counsel was inadequate</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-15\">10\u2014 the complaining witness did not appear before the grand jury on his indictment for perverted practice</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-17\">11\u2014 he was illegally arrested and evidence seized as a result was improperly admitted</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-19\">The first ten contentions raised by Leek were discussed and properly dismissed by Judge Allen for stated reasons which we adopt.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-20\">Upon examination of the events surrounding Leek\u2019s arrest which are pertinent to his eleventh claim, it becomes clear that the allegation of illegality of arrest is without merit. After the crime was committed and the victim released by Leek, she promptly told the police the details of the crime and gave them a description of the car in which the assault took place, including its license number and color. Acting on that information, police officers arrested Leek, the owner of the car. Probable cause for the applicant\u2019s arrest existed (See <em>Farrow v. State, </em>233 Md. 526; <em>Price v. State, 227 </em>Md. 28; <em>Mulcahy v. State, </em>221 Md. 413; <em>Edwards v. State, </em>196 Md. 233) and, therefore, any evidence seized from Leek by the police at the time he was arrested <em>(e.g. </em>his undershorts) was not improperly used against him at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-21\">While the application for leave to appeal was pending before us, we caused a copy of the printed record extract filed here in Leek\u2019s original appeal to be sent him and he prepared a twenty-page typewritten brief for our consideration. It restated and argued the eleven contentions listed and disposed of above but did not change our views that the contentions lacked substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-22\">\n<em>Application denied.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
