At this point a neighbor, who was returning shampoo she had borrowed from the wife, distracted the appellant and the wife was able to knock the gun from her husband\u2019s hand, whereupon, according to the wife, he hit her and kicked her and struggled with her in an effort \u201cto point the gun back towards me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>If the trier of facts believed the facts to be as the wife and the neighbor said they were, as he seemingly did, he properly could have found that the pointing of the deadly weapon at the head and the expressed intention to kill, followed by the struggle to again point the gun at the wife established the necessary elements of the crime of assault with intent to murder. Had death ensued, the evidence would clearly have supported a finding of malice and of commission of the crime of murder. <em>Marks v. State, </em>230 Md. 108, 112; <em>Beall v.
