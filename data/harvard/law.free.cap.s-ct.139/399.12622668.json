Miller is the second inmate in just over a month who has chosen to die by the electric chair in order to avoid the State's current lethal injection protocol. See <em>Zagorski v. Haslam</em> , 586 U.S. ----, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12620251\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/139/20/\">139 S.Ct. 20</extracted-citation>, --- L.Ed.2d ---- (2018) (SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting from denial of application for stay and denial of certiorari). Both so chose even though electrocution can be a dreadful way to die.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> They did so against the backdrop of credible scientific evidence that lethal injection as currently practiced in Tennessee may well be even worse. See <em>id</em> ., at ----, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12620251\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/139/20/\">139 S.Ct., at </extracted-citation>21 ; <em>Irick v. Tennessee</em> , 585 U.S. ----, ---- - ----, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12617285,12617286\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/139/1/\">139 S.Ct. 1</extracted-citation>, 1-2, --- L.Ed.2d ---- (2018) (SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting from denial of application for stay).</p><p id=\"p-8\">The decision that the Court leaves undisturbed in this case rests in part on the fiction that Miller's choice was voluntary, and in part on predictions about the efficacy of electric chairs made over a century ago. App. to Pet. for Cert. 19a; see <em>In re Kemmler</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1217862\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/136/436/#p443\">136 U.S. 436</extracted-citation>, 443-444, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1217862\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/136/436/#p443\">10 S.Ct. 930</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1217862\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/136/436/#p443\">34 L.Ed. 519</extracted-citation> (1890). Another decision that the Court today declines to review faulted Miller for not proving an available alternative means of his own execution. See No. 18-6739, <em>Miller v. Parker</em> , <em>supra</em> , p. ----. It did so while effectively permitting the State to turn that \"perverse requirement\" into a moving target. See <em>McGehee v. Hutchinson</em> , 581 U.S. ----, ----, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12603558\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1275/#p1276\">137 S.Ct. 1275</extracted-citation>, 1276, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604663,12603558,12604655\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/l-ed-2d/197/746/\">197 L.Ed.2d 746</extracted-citation> (2017) (SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting from denial of application for stay and denial of certiorari). These cases are the unfortunate byproducts of this Court's decision in <em>Glossip v. Gross</em> , 576 U.S. ----, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591161\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2726/\">135 S.Ct. 2726</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591161\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2726/\">192 L.Ed.2d 761</extracted-citation> (2015). Such madness should not continue. Respectfully, I dissent.</p></opinion>\n</casebody>\n</body></html>"
