The trial courts in both cases ruled that plaintiffs\u2019 expert witnesses are not qualified under \u00a7 2169(1). In <em>Woodard, </em>the Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court\u2019s ruling on this issue, and, in <em>Hamilton, </em>the Court of Appeals reversed the trial court\u2019s decision. We conclude that the trial courts did not abuse their discretion in concluding that plaintiffs\u2019 proposed expert witnesses are not qualified under \u00a7 2169(1). Therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>in <em>Woodard, </em>we affirm the part of the Court of Appeals judgment that held that plaintiffs\u2019 proposed expert is not qualified and remand to the trial court for reentry of its order dismissing plaintiffs\u2019 claim with prejudice. In <em>Hamilton, </em>we reverse the Court of Appeals judgment and remand to the trial court for reentry of its order granting a directed verdict to defendant.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"A9ba\">A. <em>WOODARD v CUSTER</em></p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">We summarized the facts underlying this case in our recent decision in <em>Woodard v Custer, </em>473 Mich 1, 3-5; 702 NW2d 522 (2005) <em>(Woodard I):</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-8\">Plaintiffs\u2019 fifteen-day-old son was admitted to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) at the University of Michigan Hospital, where he was treated for a respiratory problem. During his stay in the PICU, he was under the care of Dr. Joseph R. Custer, the Director of Pediatric Critical Care Medicine. When the infant was moved to the general hospital ward, physicians in that ward discovered that both of the infant\u2019s legs were fractured. Plaintiffs sued Dr. Custer and the hospital, alleging that the fractures were the result of negligent medical procedures, namely, the improper placement of an arterial line in the femoral vein of the infant\u2019s right leg and the improper placement of a venous catheter in the infant\u2019s left leg.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-9\">Defendant physician is board-certified in pediatrics and has certificates of special qualifications in pediatric critical care medicine and neonatal-perinatal medicine. Plaintiffs\u2019 proposed expert witness, who signed plaintiffs\u2019 affidavit of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>merit, is board-certified in pediatrics, but does not have any certificates of special qualifications.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-4\">Before discovery, the trial court denied defendants\u2019 motion for summary disposition, concluding that plaintiffs\u2019 attorney had a \u201creasonable belief\u201d under MCL 600.2912d(l) that plaintiffs\u2019 proposed expert witness was qualified under MCL 600.2169 to testify against the defendant physician, and, thus, that plaintiffs\u2019 affidavit of merit was sufficient. After discovery, the trial court granted defendants\u2019 motion to strike plaintiffs\u2019 expert witness on the basis that he was not actually qualified under MCL 600.2169 to testify against the defendant physician. The trial court dismissed plaintiffs\u2019 claim with prejudice, concluding that plaintiffs could not reach a jury without expert testimony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-6\">The Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court\u2019s ruling that plaintiffs\u2019 proposed expert witness was not qualified under MCL 600.2169 to testify against the defendant physician (Judge BORRELLO dissented on this issue), hut reversed the trial court\u2019s dismissal on the basis that expert testimony was unnecessary under the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur, i.e., an inference of negligence may be drawn from the fact that the infant was admitted to the PICU with healthy legs and discharged from the PICU with fractured legs (Judge Talbot dissented on this issue). Unpublished opinion per curiam, issued October 21, 2003 (Docket Nos. 239868-239869). The case was remanded for trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-7\">Defendants sought leave to appeal the Court of Appeals decision that res ipsa loquitur applies and that expert testimony was not necessary. Plaintiffs sought leave to cross-appeal the Court of Appeals decision that their proposed expert witness was not qualified under MCL 600.2169 to testify against the defendant physician. We heard oral argument on whether to grant the applications or take other peremptory action permitted by MCR 7.302(G)(1). 471 Mich 890 (2004).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b609-9\">In <em>Woodard I, </em>we addressed defendants\u2019 application for leave to appeal and held that expert testimony is necessary in this case. At the same time, we granted plaintiffs\u2019 cross-application for leave to appeal to ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>dress whether plaintiffs\u2019 proposed expert witness is qualified under MCL 600.2169(1), which is the subject of the instant opinion. 473 Mich 856 (2005).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">B. <em>HAMILTON v KULIGOWSKI</em></p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">Plaintiff alleges that the defendant physician failed to properly diagnose and treat the decedent while she exhibited prestroke symptoms. The defendant physician is board certified in general internal medicine and specializes in general internal medicine. Plaintiffs proposed expert witness is board certified in general internal medicine and devotes a majority of his professional time to treating infectious diseases, a subspecialty of internal medicine. The trial court granted defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict on the basis that plaintiffs expert is not qualified to testify against the defendant physician because plaintiffs expert specializes in infectious diseases and did not devote a majority of his professional time to practicing or teaching general internal medicine. The Court of Appeals reversed, concluding that plaintiffs expert is qualified to testify against the defendant physician because both plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>proposed expert witness and the defendant physician specialize in internal medicine and because plaintiffs proposed expert did devote a majority of his professional time to the practice of internal medicine given that the treatment of infectious diseases is a subspecialty of internal medicine. 261 Mich App 608; 684 NW2d 366 (2004). We granted defendant\u2019s application for leave to appeal. 473 Mich 858 (2005).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">II. standard of review</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">These cases both involve the interpretation of MCL 600.2169(1). This Court reviews questions of statutory interpretation de novo. <em>Halloran v Bhan, </em>470 Mich 572, 576; 683 NW2d 129 (2004). However, this Court reviews a trial court\u2019s rulings concerning the qualifications of proposed expert witnesses to testify for an abuse of discretion. <em>Cox v Flint Bd of Hosp Managers, </em>467 Mich 1, 16 n 16; 651 NW2d 356 (2002). An abuse of discretion occurs when the decision results in an outcome falling outside the principled range of outcomes. <em>Novi v Robert Adell Children\u2019s Funded Trust, </em>473 Mich 242, 254; 701 NW2d 144 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">MCL 600.2169 provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-9\">(1) In an action alleging medical malpractice, a person shall not give expert testimony on the <em>appropriate </em>standard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>of practice or care unless <em>the person </em>is licensed as a health professional in this state or another state and meets the following criteria:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-5\">(a) If the party against whom or on whose behalf the testimony is offered is a specialist, specializes at the time of the occurrence that is the basis for the action in <em>the same specialty </em>as the party against whom or on whose behalf the testimony is offered. However, if the party against whom or on whose behalf the testimony is offered is a specialist who is hoard certified, the expert witness must be a specialist who is board certified in <em>that specialty.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-6\">(b) Subject to subdivision (c), during the year immediately preceding the date of the occurrence that is the basis for the claim or action, devoted a <em>majority </em>of his or her professional time to either or both of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-7\">(i) The active clinical practice of the same health profession in which the party against whom or on whose behalf the testimony is offered is licensed and, if that party is a specialist, the active clinical practice of <em>that specialty.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-8\">Cii) The instruction of students in an accredited health professional school or accredited residency or clinical research program in the same health profession in which the party against whom or on whose behalf the testimony is offered is licensed and, if that party is a specialist, an accredited health professional school or accredited residency or clinical research program in <em>the same specialty. </em>[Emphasis added.]<footnotemark>[4]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b612-9\">A. MOST RELEVANT SPECIALTY AND BOARD CERTIFICATION</p>\n<p id=\"b612-10\">Although specialties and board certificates must match, not <em>all </em>specialties and board certificates must match. Rather, \u00a7 2169(1) states that \u201ca person shall not give expert testimony on the <em>appropriate </em>standard of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>practice or care unless <em>... </em>(Emphasis added.) That is, \u00a7 2169(1) addresses the necessary qualifications of an expert witness to testify regarding the <em>\u201cappropriate </em>standard of practice or care,\u201d not regarding an inappropriate or irrelevant standard of medical practice or care. Because an expert witness is not required to testify regarding an inappropriate or irrelevant standard of medical practice or care, \u00a7 2169(1) should not be understood to require such witness to specialize in specialties and possess board certificates that are not relevant to the standard of medical practice or care about which the witness is to testify. As this Court explained in <em>McDougall v Schanz, </em>461 Mich 15, 24-25; 597 NW2d 148 (1999), \u201c[MCL 600.2169(1)] operates to preclude certain witnesses from testifying solely on the basis of the witness\u2019 lack of practice or teaching experience in the <em>relevant </em>specialty.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">Further, \u00a7 2169(1) refers to \u201cthe same specialty\u201d and \u201cthat specialty.\u201d It does not refer to \u201cthe same specialties\u201d and \u201cthose specialties.\u201d That is, \u00a7 2169(1) requires the matching of a singular specialty, not multiple specialties. As the Court of Appeals explained in <em>Tate v Detroit Receiving Hosp, </em>249 Mich App 212, 218; 642 NW2d 346 (2002), \u201cthe statute expressly uses the word \u2018specialty,\u2019 as opposed to \u2018specialties,\u2019 thereby implying that the specialty requirement is tied to the occurrence of the alleged malpractice and not unrelated specialties that a defendant physician may hold.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">Moreover, \u00a7 2169(l)(b) requires the plaintiffs expert to have \u201cduring the year immediately preceding the date of the occurrence that is the basis for the claim or action, devoted a <em>majority </em>of his or her professional time to either\u201d the \u201cactive clinical practice\u201d or the \u201cinstruction of students\u201d in \u201cthe same specialty\u201d as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>defendant physician.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) Obviously, a specialist can only devote a <em>majority </em>of his professional time to <em>one </em>specialty. Therefore, it is clear that \u00a7 2169(1) only requires the plaintiffs expert to match one of the defendant physician\u2019s specialties. Because the plaintiffs expert will be providing expert testimony on the appropriate or relevant standard of practice or care, not an inappropriate or irrelevant standard of practice or care, it follows that the plaintiffs expert witness must match the one most relevant standard of practice or care \u2014 the specialty engaged in by the defendant physician during the course of the alleged malpractice, and, if the defendant physician is board certified in that specialty, the plaintiffs expert must also be board certified in that specialty.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">B. SAME SPECIALTY REQUIREMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">The first requirement of \u00a7 2169(l)(a) is that \u201c[i]f the party against whom or on whose behalf the testimony is offered is a specialist, [the expert witness must have] specialize^] at the time of the occurrence that is the basis for the action in the same specialty as the party against whom or on whose behalf the testimony is offered.\u201d That is, if a defendant physician is a specialist, the plaintiffs expert witness must have specialized in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>the same specialty as the defendant physician at the time of the alleged malpractice.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-4\">MCL 600.2169(1) does not define the term \u201cspecialty.\u201d \u201cWe may consult dictionary definitions of terms that are not defined in a statute.\u201d <em>People v Perkins, </em>473 Mich 626, 639; 703 NW2d 448 (2005). \u201c[T]echnical words and phrases, and such as may have acquired a peculiar and appropriate meaning in the law, shall be construed and understood according to such peculiar and appropriate meaning.\u201d MCL 8.3a. Because \u00a7 2169(1) pertains to \u201cactions[s] alleging <em>medical </em>malpractice\u201d and because the term \u201cspecialty\u201d may have acquired a \u201cpeculiar and appropriate meaning\u201d in the medical field, it is appropriate to look to medical dictionaries to define the term \u201cspecialty.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\"><em>Dorland\u2019s Illustrated Medical Dictionary </em>(28th ed) defines a \u201cspecialist\u201d as \u201ca physician whose practice is limited to a particular branch of medicine or surgery, especially one who, by virtue of advanced training, is certified by a specialty board as being qualified to so limit his practice.\u201d MCL 600.2169(l)(a) requires the plaintiff\u2019s expert to specialize in the same specialty as the defendant physician, and, if the defendant physician is \u201ca <em>specialist who is board certified, </em>the expert witness must be a specialist who is board certified in that specialty.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Both the dictionary definition of \u201cspecialist\u201d and the plain language of \u00a7 2169(l)(a) make it clear that a physician can be a specialist who is not board certified. They also make it clear that a \u201cspecialist\u201d is somebody who can potentially become board certified. Therefore, a \u201cspecialty\u201d is a particular branch of medicine or surgery in which one can potentially become board certified. Accordingly, if the defendant physician practices a particular branch of medicine or surgery in which one can potentially be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>come board certified, the plaintiffs expert must practice or teach the same particular branch of medicine or surgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">Plaintiffs argue that \u00a7 2169(l)(a) only requires their expert witnesses to have specialized in the same specialty as the defendant physician, not the same subspecialty. We respectfully disagree. As explained above, \u201cspecialty\u201d is defined as a particular branch of medicine or surgery in which one can potentially become board certified. Moreover, \u201csub\u201d is defined as \u201ca prefix. .. with the meanings \u2018under,\u2019 \u2018below,\u2019 \u2018beneath\u2019. .. \u2018secondary,\u2019 \u2018at a lower point in a hierarchy[.]\u2019 \u201d <em>Random House Webster\u2019s College Dictionary </em>(1997). Therefore, a \u201csubspecialty\u201d is a particular branch of medicine or surgery in which one can potentially become board certified that falls under a specialty or within the hierarchy of that specialty. A subspecialty, although a more particularized specialty, is nevertheless a specialty. Therefore, if a defendant physician specializes in a subspecialty, the plaintiffs expert witness must have specialized in the same subspecialty as the defendant physician at the time of the occurrence that is the basis for the action.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">C. SAME BOARD CERTIFICATE REQUIREMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">The next requirement of \u00a7 2169(l)(a) is that \u201cif the party against whom or on whose behalf the testimony is offered is a specialist who is board certified, the expert witness must be a specialist who is board certified in that specialty.\u201d As we recently explained in <em>Halloran, supra </em>at 574, \u201cMCL 600.2169(l)(a) requires that the proposed expert witness must have the same board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>certification as the party against whom or on whose behalf the testimony is offered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">Plaintiffs argue that the definition of \u201cboard certified\u201d found in the Public Health Code should apply here. We respectfully disagree. The Public Health Code, MCL 333.2701(a), defines \u201cboard certified\u201d as \u201ccertified to practice in a particular medical specialty by a national board recognized by the American board of medical specialties or the American osteopathic association.\u201d However, the Legislature specifically limited the use of the Public Health Code\u2019s definition of \u201cboard certified\u201d to the Public Health Code by stating, <em>\u201cAs used in this part.. </em>. \u2018[b]oard certified\u2019 means . ...\u201d MCL 333.2701(a) (emphasis added). The statute at issue here, MCL 600.2169(1), is part of the Revised Judicature Act, not the Public Health Code, and, thus, the Public Health Code\u2019s definition of \u201cboard certified\u201d does not apply to the statute at issue here.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">Moreover, the Legislature has defined \u201cboard certified\u201d differently in other statutes. Therefore, even if we thought it appropriate to borrow another statute\u2019s definition of \u201cboard certified,\u201d the definition would vary depending on which statute\u2019s definition was borrowed. For instance, the Legislature has defined \u201cboard certified\u201d in the Insurance Code, MCL 500.2212a(4), as \u201ccertified to practice in a particular medical or other health professional specialty by the American board of medical specialties or another appropriate national health professional organization.\u201d Plaintiffs fail to explain why we should choose the Public Health Code\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>definition over the Insurance Code\u2019s definition. We also note that the Legislature limited the Insurance Code\u2019s definition of \u201cboard certified\u201d to the Insurance Code by stating, <em>\u201cAs used in this section, </em>\u2018board certified\u2019 means ....\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). Because the statute at issue here is part of the Revised Judicature Act, not the Insurance Code, the Insurance Code\u2019s definition does not apply to the statute at issue here. Since the Legislature has not defined \u201cboard certified\u201d in the statute at issue here, we instead look to the medical dictionary definition of \u201cboard certified.\u201d <em>Perkins, supra </em>at 639.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\"><em>Taber\u2019s Cyclopedic Medical Dictionary </em>(18th ed) defines \u201ccertification\u201d as \u201ca legal document prepared by an official body that indicates a person or institution has met certain standards, or that a person has completed a prescribed course of instruction or training.\u201d Similarly, <em>Gould Medical Dictionary </em>(3d ed) defines \u201ccertification\u201d as \u201c[a] statement by an officially recognized and legally constituted body, such as a medical board, that a person or institution has met or complied with certain standards of excellence.\u201d Therefore, we conclude that to be \u201cboard certified\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 2169(1) (a) means to have received certification from an official group of persons who direct or supervise the practice of medicine that provides evidence of one\u2019s medical qualifications.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Accordingly, if a defendant physician has received certification from a medical organization to this effect, the plaintiffs expert witness must also have obtained the same certification in order to be qualified to testify concerning the appropriate standard of medical practice or care.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>Plaintiffs argue that a certificate of special qualifications<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> is not a board certificate. We respectfully disagree. Contrary to plaintiffs\u2019 assertion, nothing in \u00a7 2169(l)(a) limits the meaning of board certificate to certificates in the 24 primary medical specialties recognized by the American Board of Medical Specialties or the 18 primary medical specialties recognized by the American Osteopathic Association. Because a certificate of special qualifications is a document from an official organization that directs or supervises the practice of medicine that provides evidence of one\u2019s medical qualifications, it constitutes a board certificate. Accordingly, if a defendant physician has received a certificate of special qualifications, the plaintiffs expert witness must have obtained the same certificate of special qualifications in order to be qualified to testify under \u00a7 2169(l)(a).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">D. SAME PRACTICE/MSTRUCTION REQUIREMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">MCL 600.2169(1)(b) provides that if the defendant physician is a specialist, the expert witness must have \u201cduring the year immediately preceding the date of the occurrence that is the basis for the claim or action, devoted a majority of his or her professional time to either .. . the active clinical practice of that specialty [or] [t]he instruction of students in an . . . accredited health professional school or accredited residency or clinical research program in the same specialty.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Once <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>again the statute refers to \u201cthe same specialty\u201d and \u201cthat specialty,\u201d implying that only a single specialty must be matched. In addition, \u00a7 2169(l)(b) requires the plaintiffs expert to have \u201cdevoted a majority of his or her professional time\u201d to practicing or teaching the specialty in which the defendant physician specializes. As we explained above, one cannot devote a \u201cmajority\u201d of one\u2019s professional time to more than one specialty. Therefore, in order to be qualified to testify under \u00a7 2169(l)(b), the plaintiffs expert witness must have devoted a majority of his professional time during the year immediately preceding the date on which the alleged malpractice occurred to practicing or teaching the specialty that the defendant physician was practicing at the time of the alleged malpractice, i.e., the one most relevant specialty.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">E. RESPONSE TO CHIEF JUSTICE TAYLOR\u2019S CONCURRENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">Chief Justice TAYLOR\u2019s concurrence concludes that unless the defendant physician <em>himself </em>concedes that not all of his specialties are relevant, the plaintiffs expert must match all of the defendant physician\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>specialties. However, because the concurrence recognizes that it would be impossible to obtain an expert witness who devotes a majority of his professional time to all of the defendant physician\u2019s specialties, see \u00a7 2169(l)(b) and part III(D) of this opinion, the concurrence concludes that the plaintiff can simply employ multiple experts to satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 2169(1). That is, a single expert does not have to satisfy all of the requirements of \u00a7 2169(1), as long as a group of experts collectively satisfy these requirements. We respectfully disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">MCL 600.2169(1) states, <em>\u201ca person </em>shall not give expert testimony on the appropriate standard of practice or care unless <em>the person </em>is licensed as a health professional in this state or another state and meets the following criteria....\u201d (Emphasis added.) That is, \u00a7 2169(1) states that a person cannot testify unless that person meets all of the requirements of \u00a7 2169(1). If that person does not meet all of the requirements of \u00a7 2169(1), that person cannot testify.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> For the reasons discussed above, we conclude that the plaintiffs expert does not have to match all of the defendant physician\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>specialties; rather, the plaintiffs expert only has to match the one most relevant specialty.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">Not only is the approach of Chief Justice TAYLOR\u2019s concurrence contrary to the requirements of the statute, it is also an approach that we believe would be unworkable in the real world. Under the concurrence\u2019s approach, if the defendant physician specializes in five specialties, for example, and refuses to concede that not all of these specialties are relevant to the alleged malpractice, the plaintiff would be required to present five expert witnesses to testify. Not only would this be extraordinarily burdensome for the plaintiff, it would also be extraordinarily burdensome for the trier of fact by infecting the entirety of the trial process with irrelevant, distracting, and confusing arguments.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">The concurrence by Chief Justice TAYLOR accuses the majority of \u201cmisunderstanding] completely the traditional roles played by the judge and jury in the trial process.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 619. However, we believe that it is the concurrence that misunderstands these roles. Typically, the trial court allows the parties to introduce relevant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>evidence and does not allow the parties to introduce irrelevant evidence. See MRE 402, which provides, \u201cAll relevant evidence is admissible, except as otherwise provided by the Constitution of the United States, the Constitution of the State of Michigan, these rules, or other rules adopted by the Supreme Court. Evidence which is not relevant is not admissible.\u201d Under the concurrence\u2019s approach, however, the parties would effectively be required to present irrelevant evidence, potentially a great amount of such evidence. And, instead of the trial court itself reviewing the evidence to determine what is and what is not relevant, the trier of fact would be required to do so.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">Requiring the admission of irrelevant evidence would not only be a waste of time and limited judicial resources, it would also cause enormous confusion and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>distraction for the fact-finder. For instance, if the defendant physician claims to specialize in dermatology, internal medicine, plastic surgery, pediatrics, and urology and he negligently prescribes an adult dosage of amoxicillin to a three-year-old child suffering from an ear infection, under the majority\u2019s approach, the plaintiffs expert would have to specialize in pediatrics. However, under the approach of Chief Justice Taylor\u2019s concurrence, the plaintiffs phalanx of experts would have to specialize in dermatology, internal medicine, plastic surgery, pediatrics, and urology. That is, instead of the jury hearing testimony regarding the relevant specialty of pediatrics, the jury would be required also to endure testimony regarding the irrelevant specialties of dermatology, internal medicine, plastic surgery, and urology. To require the jury to hear such irrelevant testimony would confuse the jury and distract it from evaluating the relevant legal issues. Because this is not how the trial process is typically conducted in Michigan, and because the statute does not require trials to be conducted in such a confusing manner, we refuse to impose such a requirement upon the process.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">The concurrence by Chief Justice TAYLOR contends that we are giving the trial court <em>\u201ca </em>power of theory preclusion... heretofore unknown in our jurisprudence.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 618-619. First, whether expert testimony is described as a \u201ctheory\u201d or evidence supporting a theory, testimony regarding a specialty that was not being practiced at the time of the alleged malpractice is irrelevant, and, thus, inadmissible. In other words, irrelevant expert testimony does not magically become relevant and admissible simply by calling it a \u201ctheory.\u201d To use the concurrence\u2019s collapsed building hypothetical, the defendant architect would obviously be able to introduce relevant evidence of an earthquake. However, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>he would not be able to introduce irrelevant evidence of an earthquake, for instance, evidence that an earthquake occurred years after the building collapsed in a country half way around the world. That is, the defendant architect is not precluded from introducing relevant theories, i.e., that the building collapsed because an earthquake occurred that same day in a neighboring city, but he is precluded from introducing irrelevant theories, i.e., that the building collapsed because an earthquake occurred years after the building collapsed in a country half way around the world.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">Second, our holding that relevant expert testimony is admissible and irrelevant expert testimony is inadmissible is hardly a novel holding. As we have explained, it has always been the trial court\u2019s job to facilitate the introduction of relevant evidence and to preclude the introduction of irrelevant evidence.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> We are aware of no precedent that would require all irrelevant specialties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>to match, or that would countenance a phalanx of experts, each of whom would be charged with testifying about a different irrelevant specialty. As the concurrence by Chief Justice TAYLOR itself recognizes, it is they, not the majority, that are advocating a change in the status, because the Court of Appeals in <em>Tate </em>held that irrelevant specialties do not have to match. The horror stories predicted by the concurrence upon the adoption of the majority position simply have not been borne out under <em>Tate. </em>Moreover, we note that <em>none </em>of the parties in these two cases argued that irrelevant specialties and board certificates must match, and none of the parties or the amici curiae argued in favor of the approach adopted by Chief Justice Taylor\u2019s concurrence.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">Further, we note that just because an expert is qualified under \u00a7 2169(1) does not mean that the trial court cannot disqualify the expert on other grounds. MCL 600.2169(2) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-6\">In determining the qualifications of an expert witness in an action alleging medical malpractice, the court shall, at a minimum, evaluate all of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-7\">(a) The educational and professional training of the expert witness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-8\">(b) The area of specialization of the expert witness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-9\">(c) The length of time the expert witness has been engaged in the active clinical practice or instruction of the health profession or the specialty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-10\">(d) The relevancy of the expert witness\u2019s testimony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-11\">In addition, MCL 600.2169(3) specifically states, \u201c[t]his section does not limit the power of the trial court to disqualify an expert witness on grounds other than the qualifications set forth in this section.\u201d MCL 600.2955 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>(1) In an action for the death of a person or for injury to a person or property, a scientific opinion rendered by an otherwise qualified expert is not admissible unless the court determines that the opinion is reliable and will assist the trier of fact. In making that determination, the court shall examine the opinion and the basis for the opinion, which basis includes the facts, technique, methodology, and reasoning relied on by the expert, and shall consider all of the following factors:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-5\">(a) Whether the opinion and its basis have been subjected to scientific testing and replication.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-6\">(b) Whether the opinion and its basis have been subjected to peer review publication.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-7\">(c) The existence and maintenance of generally accepted standards governing the application and interpretation of a methodology or technique and whether the opinion and its basis are consistent with those standards.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-8\">(d) The known or potential error rate of the opinion and its basis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-9\">(e) The degree to which the opinion and its basis are generally accepted within the relevant expert community. As used in this subdivision, \u201crelevant expert community\u201d means individuals who are knowledgeable in the field of study and are gainfully employed applying that knowledge on the free market.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-10\">(f) Whether the basis for the opinion is reliable and whether experts in that field would rely on the same basis to reach the type of opinion being proffered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-11\">(g) Whether the opinion or methodology is relied upon by experts outside of the context of litigation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-12\">(2) A novel methodology or form of scientific evidence may be admitted into evidence only if its proponent establishes that it has achieved general scientific acceptance among impartial and disinterested experts in the field.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>(3) In an action alleging medical malpractice, the provisions of this section are in addition to, and do not otherwise affect, the criteria for expert testimony provided in section 2169.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">Finally, MRE 702 further provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-5\">If the court determines that scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise if (1) the testimony is based on sufficient facts or data, (2) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods, and (3) the witness has applied the principles and methods reliably to the facts of the case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">Therefore, even when a proffered expert meets the criteria contained in \u00a7 2169(1), the expert is subject to further scrutiny under \u00a7 2169(2), \u00a7 2169(3), \u00a7 2955, and MRE 702.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">Moreover, if a defendant believes that the plaintiffs expert is not qualified because he does not specialize in what the defendant believes to be the relevant specialty, the defendant can file a motion to strike the plaintiffs expert. If the trial court denies that motion, the defendant can then, of course, appeal that decision. The defendant can either file an interlocutory appeal or he can wait until the jury renders a verdict to file an application for leave to appeal. Either way, the defendant can certainly preserve the issue for appeal by objecting to the plaintiffs expert\u2019s testimony on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>basis that the expert is not qualified because he does not specialize in the relevant specialty. At this point, the defendant should make clear what he thinks the relevant specialty is and why he thinks such is the relevant specialty.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">IV APPLICATION</p>\n<p id=\"AqJ\">A. <em>WOODARD v CUSTER</em></p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">The defendant physician is the director of pediatric critical care medicine at the University of Michigan Hospital, and specializes in pediatric critical care medicine. \u201cPediatrics\u201d is \u201c[t]he medical specialty concerned with the study and treatment of children in health and disease during development from birth through adolescence.\u201d <em>Stedman\u2019s Medical Dictionary </em>(26th ed). \u201cCritical\u201d is defined as \u201c[d]enoting a morbid condition in which death is possible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Pediatric critical care medicine is the branch of medicine concerned with the care of children who are critically ill. Plaintiffs claim that an arterial line was improperly placed in the femoral vein of the infant patient\u2019s right leg and that a venous catheter was improperly placed in the infant patient\u2019s left leg while the infant was a patient in the defendant hospital\u2019s pediatric intensive care unit. There is no question that the infant patient was critically ill when these procedures were performed. For <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>these reasons, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the defendant physician was practicing pediatric critical care medicine at the time of the alleged malpractice, and, thus, pediatric critical care medicine is the one most relevant specialty.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Plaintiffs\u2019 proposed expert witness undeniably did not specialize in pediatric critical care medicine at the time of the alleged malpractice and has never specialized in pediatric critical care medicine. Therefore, plaintiffs\u2019 proposed expert witness does not satisfy the same specialty requirement of \u00a7 2169(l)(a).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b631-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>The defendant physician is board certified in pediatric critical care medicine, and, as explained above, pediatric critical care medicine is the one most relevant specially. Plaintiffs\u2019 proposed expert witness is not board certified in pediatric critical care medicine. Therefore, plaintiffs\u2019 proposed expert witness does not satisfy the same board certificate requirement of \u00a7 2169(l)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">As explained above, the defendant physician specializes in pediatric critical care medicine and pediatric critical care medicine is the one most relevant specially. During the year immediately preceding the alleged malpractice, plaintiffs\u2019 proposed expert witness did not practice or teach pediatric critical care medicine.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Therefore, plaintiffs\u2019 proposed expert witness also does not satisfy the same practice/instruction requirement of \u00a7 2169(l)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">For these reasons, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that plaintiffs\u2019 proposed expert witness is not qualified to testify on the appropriate standard of practice or care under \u00a7 2169(1). Because plaintiffs failed to present an expert qualified under \u00a7 2169(1) to testify with regard to the appropriate standard of practice or care, the trial court properly dismissed plaintiffs\u2019 claim with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">B. <em>HAMILTON v KULIGOWSKI</em></p>\n<p id=\"b631-8\">The defendant physician specializes in general internal medicine and was practicing general internal medi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>cine at the time of the alleged malpractice. During the year immediately preceding the alleged malpractice, plaintiffs proposed expert witness did not devote a majority of his time to practicing or teaching general internal medicine. Instead, he devoted a majority of his professional time to treating infectious diseases. As he himself acknowledged, he is \u201cnot sure what the average internist sees day in and day out.\u201d Therefore, plaintiffs proposed expert witness does not satisfy the same practice/instruction requirement of \u00a7 2169(l)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">For this reason, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that plaintiffs proposed expert witness is not qualified to testify regarding the appropriate standard of practice or care under \u00a7 2169(1). Because plaintiff failed to present an expert qualified under \u00a7 2169(1) to testify with regard to the appropriate standard of practice or care, the trial court properly granted a directed verdict in favor of defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">V CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">If a defendant physician is a specialist, the plaintiffs expert witness must have specialized in the same specialty as the defendant physician at the time of the occurrence that is the basis for the action. If a defendant physician specializes in a subspecialty, the plaintiffs expert witness must have specialized in the same subspecialty as the defendant physician at the time of the occurrence that is the basis for the action. If the defendant physician is a specialist who is board certified, the expert witness must be a specialist who is board certified in that specialty. If the defendant physician has received a certificate of special qualifications, the plaintiffs expert witness must have obtained the same certificate of special qualifications. However, under \u00a7 2169(l)(a), only the one most relevant specialty or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>subspecialty must match; and only the one most relevant board certificate or certificate of special qualifications must match. We are aware of no precedent that would, as required by Chief Justice TAYLOR\u2019s concurrence, require all irrelevant specialties to match or countenance a phalanx of experts, each of whom would be charged with testifying about a different irrelevant specialty. In addition, under \u00a7 2169(l)(b), if the defendant physician is a specialist, the plaintiffs expert witness must have devoted a majority of his professional time during the year immediately preceding the date on which the alleged malpractice occurred to practicing or teaching the specialty or subspecialty that the defendant physician was practicing at the time of the alleged malpractice, i.e., the one most relevant specialty or subspecialty.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\">The trial courts did not abuse their discretion here in concluding that plaintiffs\u2019 proposed expert witnesses were not qualified under MCL 600.2169(1) to testify regarding the appropriate medical standard of practice or care. Therefore, in <em>Woodard, </em>we affirm the part of the Court of Appeals judgment that held that plaintiffs\u2019 proposed expert is not qualified and remand this case to the trial court for reentry of its order dismissing plaintiffs\u2019 claim with prejudice. In <em>Hamilton, </em>we reverse the Court of Appeals judgment and remand this case to the trial court for reentry of its order granting a directed verdict to defendant.</p>\n<judges id=\"b633-5\">Cavanagh, Weaver, and Kelly, JJ., concurred with Markman, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b608-10\"> Contrary to Chief Justice Taylor\u2019s concurrence\u2019s assertion, <em>this </em>opinion is the <em>majority </em>opinion in this case given that it has four supporters\u2014 Justices Cavanagh, Weaver, and Kelly, and myself.

Regarding the former, we conclude that only one standard of practice or care was envisioned under \u00a7 2169(1), and, thus, the plaintiff need only produce one expert to testify about that standard. If a plaintiff wishes to, however, he is free to offer several different experts to testify regarding that relevant specialty, and each must meet the criteria of \u00a7 2169(1). With respect to experts who are testifying about issues unrelated to the standard of practice or care, there are no limitations on how many experts a plaintiff can produce, and a trial court will consider whether each expert is qualified using the considerations set forth in \u00a7 2169(2) as well as any other applicable requirements.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b622-6\"> The concurrence by Chief Justice Taylor seems to believe that this would not be a problem because MCL 600.2955 precludes opinion testimony that is not based on \u201cproven theories and methodologies.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 621 n 58.

First, in most cases, expert testimony probably will not be required to determine which specialties are relevant. For instance, if a defendant physician specializes in cardiovascular surgery and podiatry and he was performing heart surgery at the time of the alleged malpractice, we doubt very highly that the trial court will need expert testimony to determine that cardiovascular surgery is the relevant specialty. The concurrence states that it finds our belief that the trial court may he able to determine without expert testimony which specialty is relevant \u201ccurious given this Court\u2019s historical recognition that expert testimony is almost always needed to establish the standard of care in medical malpractice actions. ...\u201d <em>Post </em>at 625 n 64. The concurrence appears to be ignoring the distinction between determining which specialty is relevant and determining the appropriate standard of care. Using the cardiovascular surgeon/podiatrist example, although the trial court can probably determine without expert testimony that cardiovascular surgery is the relevant specialty, the trial court probably cannot determine what the appropriate standard of care is for cardiovascular surgeons performing heart surgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">Second, the trial court is, of course, not precluded from seeking expert testimony if it believes that such testimony is necessary for it to determine which specialty is relevant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b625-7\"> The concurrence by Chief Justice Taylor contends that our opinion will deny parties their constitutional right to have a jury determine factual matters. <em>Post </em>at 619.

If the issue is appealed and the appellate court believes that it does not have enough information before it to review the trial court\u2019s decision, it can certainly remand for an evidentiary hearing or take other appropriate action. The concurrence creates the potential for procedural confusion out of thin air.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b630-6\"> Chief Justice Taylor\u2019s concurrence asks us how we \u201cknow\u201d that the defendant physician was practicing pediatric critical care medicine at the time of the alleged malpractice. <em>Post </em>at 624. We \u201cknow\u201d this because all of the admissible evidence supports the trial court\u2019s finding that the defendant physician was practicing pediatric critical care medicine at the time of the alleged malpractice. Further, as Chief Justice Taylor\u2019s concurrence points out, <em>post </em>at 623, 632-633, the plaintiffs did not rebut that finding by presenting qualified expert testimony to support their argument that the defendant physician was not practicing pediatric critical care medicine at the time of the alleged malpractice. Contrary to what Chief Justice Taylor\u2019s concurrence suggests, even assuming that plaintiffs\u2019 expert is qualified to testify that defendant was not practicing pediatric critical care medicine at the time of the alleged malpractice, plaintiffs\u2019 expert cannot reasonably be understood to have testified that the defendant was not practicing pediatric critical care medicine at the time of the alleged malpractice. Plaintiffs\u2019 expert only testified that <em>he </em>performed the procedures in this case during his residency. Unlike Chief Justice Taylor\u2019s concurrence, we do not believe that the jury could have reasonably inferred from this testimony that it is \u201crelatively common for doctors who practice only general pediatric care to perform the procedures in this case ....\u201d <em>Post </em>at 624 n 63. Moreover, it is not our task to \u201cknow\u201d whether pediatric critical care medicine is or is not the relevant specialty; rather, our task is to determine whether the trial court abused its discretion in determining that pediatric critical care medicine is the relevant specialty.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b630-7\"> Plaintiffs\u2019 proposed expert witness is a pediatrician, not a pediatric critical care specialist. A good illustration of the differences between these two types of physicians can be found in this very case: when the infant began to have respiratory problems, plaintiffs took their son to the pediatrician; the pediatrician, recognizing that the infant needed to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>treated by a pediatric critical care specialist, then placed the infant in an ambulance and sent him to the defendant hospital, for treatment by the defendant physician.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b631-10\"> In fact, plaintiffs\u2019 proposed expert witness has never worked as an attending physician in a pediatric intensive care unit nor has he ever taught pediatric critical care medicine. Further, plaintiffs\u2019 proposed expert has not inserted an arterial line or a venous catheter in an infant, the specific medical procedure that was allegedly performed negligently in this case, since his residency in the early 1980\u2019s.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b633-6\">CAVANAGH, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A3L\">(concurring). I continue to believe that MCL 600.2169 is unconstitutional for the reasons set forth in my dissent in <em>McDougall v Schanz, </em>461 Mich 15, 38; 597 NW2d 148 (1999) (CAVANAGH, J, dissenting). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>But because a majority of my colleagues disagree, the statute remains in place. Accordingly, the bench and bar are entitled to be guided in its application. It is for that reason that I join the majority opinion\u2019s statutory analysis outlined by Justice MARKMAN.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">Nonetheless, I take this opportunity to point out that the difficulties in interpreting and applying \u00a7 2169 are highlighted both by the frequency with which a variety of issues surrounding the statute arise and the inability of this Court to reach a consensus on how the statute is to operate. In my view, this serves to validate the many concerns I held when <em>McDougall, supra, </em>was decided, and those concerns remain far from resolved.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b634-5\">MARKMAN, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A0C\">(concurring). I write separately to set forth an additional argument in support of the majority\u2019s conclusion that only the one most relevant specialty and board certificate must match under MCL 600.2169(1), and to explain that although only the one most relevant specialty must match under \u00a7 2169(1), the trial court may require that other relevant specialties match pursuant to MCL 600.2169(2), MCL 600.2169(3), and MRE 702. I write also to respond to Chief Justice TAYLOR\u2019s concurrence\u2019s contention that this opinion is inconsistent with the majority opinion. I have also set forth an appendix that summarizes recent Michigan Supreme Court decisions in the increasingly complex area of medical malpractice.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">MCL 600.2169(l)(a) requires a plaintiffs expert to have specialized \u201cin <em>the </em>same specialty\u201d as the defendant physician. And, if the defendant physician is a specialist who is board certified, \u00a7 2169(l)(a) requires the plaintiffs expert to be \u201cboard certified in <em>that </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>specialty.\u201d (Emphasis added.) In <em>Robinson v Detroit, </em>462 Mich 439, 462; 613 NW2d 307 (2000), this Court held that the phrase \u201cthe proximate cause\u201d as used in the governmental immunity act, MCL 691.1407(2), means \u201cthe one most immediate, efficient, and direct cause of the injury or damage ....\u201d We explained that because \u201c \u2018the\u2019 is a definite article, and \u2018cause\u2019 is a singular noun, it is clear that the phrase \u2018the proximate cause\u2019 contemplates <em>one </em>cause.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original). The same is true here. That is, because \u201cthe\u201d is a definite article, and \u201cspecialty\u201d is a singular noun, the phrase \u201cthe same specialty\u201d contemplates <em>one </em>specialty\u2014 the most relevant specialty.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Therefore, where a defendant physician specializes in multiple specialties, \u00a7 2169(l)(a) requires an expert witness to specialize only in the same specialty engaged in by the defendant physician during the course of the alleged malpractice, i.e., the one most relevant specialty. And, if the defendant physician is board certified in \u201cthat specialty\u201d\u2014 the one most relevant specialty\u2014 the plaintiffs expert witness must also be board certified in that specialty.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-4\">As the majority opinion explains, the requirements of \u00a7 2169(1) are not the only requirements that a medical expert must satisfy in order to be able to testify. MCL 600.2169(2) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-5\">In determining the qualifications of an expert witness in an action alleging medical malpractice, the court shall, at a minimum, evaluate all of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-6\">(a) The educational and professional training of the expert witness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>(b) The area of specialization of the expert witness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-4\">(c) The length of time the expert witness has been engaged in the active clinical practice or instruction of the health profession or the specialty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-5\">(d) The relevancy of the expert witness\u2019s testimony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">In addition, MCL 600.2169(3) specifically states, \u201cThis section does not limit the power of the trial court to disqualify an expert witness on grounds other than the qualifications set forth in this section.\u201d Finally, MRE 702 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-7\">If the court determines that scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise if (1) the testimony is based on sufficient facts or data, (2) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods, and (3) the witness has applied the principles and methods reliably to the facts of the case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">Therefore, although the fact that the defendant physician specializes in multiple specialties and the plaintiffs expert witness does not may not be considered under \u00a7 2169(1), it <em>may </em>be considered under \u00a7 2169(2) and MRE 702. For instance, if the defendant physician specializes in two specialties and both of these specialties are relevant, i.e., the defendant physician\u2019s actions were informed by both specialties at the time of the alleged malpractice, the trial court may well conclude that, although the plaintiffs expert witness is qualified under \u00a7 2169(1) because he specializes in the one most relevant specialty, he may not be qualified under \u00a7 2169(2) or MRE 702 because he does not specialize in both relevant specialties. Through the application of \u00a7 2169(1), as well as by the exercise of judicial discretion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>under \u00a7 2169(2) and MRE 702, plaintiffs are <em>not </em>obligated to produce experts matching irrelevant specialties of defendants, but they are obligated, in my judgment, to produce experts matching relevant specialties.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-4\">RESPONSE TO CHIEF JUSTICE TAYLOR\u2019S CONCURRENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">Chief Justice TAYLOR\u2019s concurrence contends that this concurrence is inconsistent with the majority opinion that I have written. This is simply incorrect. I agree completely with everything said in the majority opinion: (a) The majority opinion holds that irrelevant specialties do not have to match. I agree, (b) The majority opinion holds that under \u00a7 2169(1) only the one most relevant specialty must match. I agree, (c) The majority opinion holds that an individual expert must meet all of the requirements of \u00a7 2169(1) in order to testify; a group of experts cannot pool their expertise to collectively satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 2169(1). I agree, (d) The majority opinion holds that just because an expert is qualified under \u00a7 2169(1) does not mean that the trial court cannot disqualify the expert on \u201cother grounds.\u201d I agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">I write separately only to explain that I believe that one of these \u201cother grounds\u201d for disqualification can be the failure of the plaintiffs expert to match <em>other </em>relevant specialties. Contrary to Chief Justice TAYLOR\u2019s concurrence\u2019s contention, there is nothing in the majority opinion that precludes this conclusion. While the majority opinion holds that under \u00a7 2169(1) only the one most relevant specialty must match, this does not mean that a different provision of law cannot require that other relevant specialties be matched.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">Chief Justice TAYLOR\u2019s concurrence asserts that the majority opinion holds that \u201conly one expert may be utilized\u201d and the concurrence allows more. <em>Post </em>at 592. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>This is again incorrect. As I have explained, I agree completely with the majority opinion that an individual expert must meet all of the requirements of \u00a7 2169(1) in order to testify. Contrary to Chief Justice TAYLOR\u2019s concurrence, I do not believe that an assemblage of experts can join their expertise to collectively satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 2169(1). I further agree with the majority opinion that only one standard of practice or care was envisioned under \u00a7 2169(1), and, thus, the plaintiff need only produce one expert to testify about that standard, but, if a plaintiff wishes to, he is free to offer several different experts to testify regarding that relevant specialty, as long as each expert meets the criteria of \u00a7 2169(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">Chief Justice TAYLOR\u2019s concurrence contends that because I believe that multiple <em>specialties </em>may be relevant, this must also mean that I share its view that a plaintiff can utilize multiple experts because it would be impossible for any one expert to meet the requirements of MCL 600.2169(l)(b). <em>Post </em>at 631 n 71. This provision requires the proposed expert to have \u201cdevoted a majority of his or her professional time\u201d to practicing or teaching the specialty in which the defendant physician specializes. That is, Chief Justice TAYLOR\u2019s concurrence contends that because I believe that multiple specialties may be relevant, and because MCL 600.2169(l)(b) requires the proposed expert to have \u201cdevoted a majority of his or her professional time\u201d to practicing or teaching the specialty in which the defendant physician specializes, I must necessarily agree with them that the plaintiff can utilize multiple experts because one expert cannot possibly devote a majority of his professional time to practicing or teaching multiple specialties.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">However, Chief Justice TAYLOR\u2019s concurrence overlooks that I agree with the majority opinion that under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>\u00a7 2169(1) only the one most relevant specialty must match, and disagree with Chief Justice TAYLOR\u2019s concurrence that all specialties, however irrelevant, must match under \u00a7 2169(1). Because only the one most relevant specialty must match under \u00a7 2169(1), it is not at all impossible for an expert to meet the requirements of \u00a7 2169(l)(b). Moreover, contrary to Chief Justice TAYLOR\u2019s concurrence\u2019s contention, \u00a7 2169(l)(b) does not \u201cpreclude any expert from providing testimony regarding more than one specialty area.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 592. For instance, using Chief Justice TAYLOR\u2019s concurrence\u2019s hypothetical defendant physician who specializes in cardiovascular surgery and nephrology and who negligently inserts a pacemaker, if the trial court determines that cardiovascular surgery is the one most relevant specialty, under \u00a7 2169(1) (a), the plaintiffs expert must specialize in cardiovascular surgery and, under \u00a7 2169(l)(b), he must have devoted a majority of his professional time practicing or teaching cardiovascular surgery. However, even if the plaintiffs expert meets the requirements of \u00a7 2169(1), the trial court may conclude that nephrology is also a relevant specialty and that, if the expert does not also specialize in nephrology, he is not qualified under either \u00a7 2169(2) or MRE 702. Again, there is nothing inconsistent with holding that an expert may be qualified under one provision of law, but is not qualified under a different provision. Moreover, if the plaintiffs expert devotes a majority of his professional time to practicing or teaching cardiovascular surgery and also specializes in nephrology, nothing precludes that expert from testifying about both cardiovascular surgery and nephrology because \u00a7 2169(1) (b) only applies to the one most relevant specialty.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-4\">Chief Justice TAYLOR\u2019s concurrence professes to concur with my concurring opinion. <em>Post </em>at 591. While this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>would be welcome, those who signed Chief Justice TAYLOR\u2019s opinion should understand my concurring opinion more clearly than they do. While this opinion and Chief Justice TAYLOR\u2019s concurrence are in agreement with the proposition that all relevant specialties must match, our analyses differ. While this opinion grounds this conclusion in \u00a7 2169(2) and MRE 702, Chief Justice TAYLOR\u2019s concurrence grounds this conclusion in \u00a7 2169(1). Of greater practical significance, the analysis in this opinion, unlike that of Chief Justice TAYLOR\u2019s concurrence, cannot be separated from the majority opinion\u2019s proposition that no irrelevant specialties must match and that an individual expert must meet all of the requirements of \u00a7 2169(1) in order to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">Because Chief Justice TAYLOR\u2019s concurrence sows confusion regarding where the majority lies, I will attempt to clarify this. In my judgment, there is majority support for the following propositions:</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">(1) Irrelevant specialties do not have to match (Justices Cavanagh, Weaver, and Kelly, and myself);</p>\n<p id=\"b640-8\">(2) Under \u00a7 2169(1), only the one most relevant specialty must match (Justices CAVANAGH, WEAVER, and Kelly, and myself);</p>\n<p id=\"b640-9\">(3) An individual expert must meet all of the requirements of \u00a7 2169(1) in order to testify (Justices CAVANAGH, Weaver, and Kelly, and myself);</p>\n<p id=\"b640-10\">(4) An assemblage of experts cannot join their expertise to collectively satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 2169(1) (Justices Cavanagh, Weaver, and Kelly, and myself);</p>\n<p id=\"b640-11\">(5) That an expert is qualified under \u00a7 2169(1) does not mean that the trial court cannot disqualify the expert on other grounds (Chief Justice TAYLOR and Justices Cavanagh, Weaver, Kelly, Corrigan, and YOUNG, and myself);</p>\n<p id=\"b641-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>(6) Other relevant specialties may have to match under \u00a7 2169(2) and MRE 702 (Chief Justice TAYLOR and Justices CORRIGAN and YOUNG, and myself).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-4\">appendix</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">In light of the growing complexity of medical malpractice statutes in Michigan and the resultant case law, the following is designed as a brief summary of recent Michigan Supreme Court decisions in this area.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">(1) If the claim pertains to an action that occurred within the course of a professional medical relationship and the claim raises questions of medical judgment beyond the realm of common knowledge and experience, the claim sounds in medical malpractice, not ordinary negligence. <em>Bryant v Oakpointe Villa Nursing Ctr, Inc, </em>471 Mich 411; 684 NW2d 864 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">(2) The period of limitations is two years for an action charging malpractice.

Thus, we agree with Justice MARKMAN\u2019s concurring opinion that there can be more than one relevant area of medical specialty at issue in establishing a breach of the applicable standard of care, and that a proffered expert may be excluded on that basis. At first glance, Justice MARKMAN\u2019s concurrence appears to be inconsistent with his lead opinion because the lead opinion would only permit evidence of a singular medical specialty to be adduced. The lead opinion concludes that the trial court must choose <em>one, </em>and only one, specialty that is relevant to establishing the appropriate standard of care and precludes the parties from introducing expert testimony with regard to any other relevant specialty. Justice MARKMAN\u2019s concurrence, however, concludes, as we do, that <em>more than one </em>medical specialty may be ger<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>mane in establishing the requisite standard of care and that plaintiffs may be required to introduce expert testimony regarding other relevant specialties.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">Furthermore, we agree with Justice Markman\u2019s concurring opinion that the practice and teaching requirements in MCL 600.2169(l)(b) preclude any expert from providing testimony regarding more than one specialty area. Thus, because he opines that plaintiffs can be obligated to produce expert testimony regarding more than one specialty area, and every expert may only testify regarding one specialty area, it logically follows that plaintiffs <em>must </em>be able to utilize <em>more than one </em>expert to establish a breach of the applicable standard of care, a conclusion with which we wholeheartedly agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">Thus, we believe that Justice MARKMAN\u2019s \u201cconcurrence\u201d more closely resembles this opinion than the lead opinion. We therefore concur with his concurrence insofar as it concludes that there can be more than one specialty germane to establishing the appropriate standard of care, and also insofar as it implicitly stands for the conclusion that multiple experts may be utilized in establishing a breach of the appropriate standard of care.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As such, there are four votes for these two conclusions of law, just as the lead opinion purports to carry four votes for the conclusions that there can be only one relevant specialty and that only one expert may be utilized.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, in this peculiar, perhaps <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>unprecedented, situation, we conclude that Justice MARKMAN\u2019s concurrence, insofar as it concludes that multiple specialties may be relevant and that multiple experts may be utilized, is the law. Certainly, the fact that Justice Markman lends his signature to two incompatible opinions does not lead to the conclusion that he may cast two separate votes. Rather, because his concurrence was written conceptually later in time than his lead opinion, his concurrence is the law. While some of our analysis goes beyond these two points of his concurrence, it is submitted as the better approach to the statute under review and may be of use in later cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">INTRODUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">In these medical malpractice cases, we granted leave to appeal to consider whether plaintiffs\u2019 proposed expert witnesses qualify under MCL 600.2169 to testify regarding what standards of care the defendant doctors should have met. The trial courts in both cases granted defendants\u2019 motions to strike plaintiffs\u2019 proposed experts on the basis that they were not qualified under MCL 600.2169. In <em>Woodard, </em>a majority of the Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court\u2019s ruling on this issue.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In <em>Hamilton, </em>the Court of Appeals reversed the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>court\u2019s judgment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We conclude in both cases that plaintiffs\u2019 proposed experts do not meet the requirements of MCL 600.2169 and, therefore, that plaintiffs have failed to present expert testimony sufficient to support their claims. Therefore, in <em>Woodard, </em>we affirm the part of the Court of Appeals judgment that held that plaintiffs\u2019 proposed expert is not qualified and remand this case to the circuit court for reinstatement of its order dismissing plaintiffs\u2019 claim with prejudice. In <em>Hamilton, </em>we reverse the Court of Appeals judgment that plaintiffs proposed expert is qualified and remand this case to the circuit court for reinstatement of its order granting a directed verdict to defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">I. FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS BELOW</p>\n<p id=\"AXY\">A. <em>WOODARD v CUSTER</em></p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">We summarized the facts underlying this case in our recent decision in <em>Woodard I:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-8\">Plaintiffs\u2019 fifteen-day-old son was admitted to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) at the University of Michigan Hospital, where he was treated for a respiratory problem. During his stay in the PICU, he was under the care of Dr. Joseph R. Custer, the Director of Pediatric Critical Care Medicine. When the infant was moved to the general hospital ward, physicians in that ward discovered that both of the infant\u2019s legs were fractured. Plaintiffs sued Dr. Custer and the hospital, alleging that the fractures were the result of negligent medical procedures, namely, the improper placement of an arterial line in the femoral vein of the infant\u2019s right leg and the improper placement of a venous catheter in the infant\u2019s left leg.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-9\">Defendant physician is board-certified in pediatrics and has certificates of special qualifications in pediatric critical care medicine and neonatal-perinatal medicine. Plaintiffs\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>proposed expert witness, who signed plaintiffs\u2019 affidavit of merit, is board-certified in pediatrics, but does not have any certificates of special qualifications.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-5\">Before discovery, the trial court denied defendants\u2019 motion for summary disposition, concluding that plaintiffs\u2019 attorney had a \u201creasonable belief\u201d under MCL 600.2912d(l) that plaintiffs\u2019 proposed expert witness was qualified under MCL 600.2169 to testify against the defendant physician, and, thus, that plaintiffs\u2019 affidavit of merit was sufficient. After discovery, the trial court granted defendants\u2019 motion to strike plaintiffs\u2019 expert witness on the basis that he was not actually qualified under MCL 600.2169 to testify against the defendant physician. The trial court dismissed plaintiffs\u2019 claim with prejudice, concluding that plaintiffs could not reach a jury without expert testimony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-7\">The Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court\u2019s ruling that plaintiffs\u2019 proposed expert witness was not qualified under MCL 600.2169 to testify against the defendant physician (Judge BORRELLO dissented on this issue), but reversed the trial court\u2019s dismissal on the basis that expert testimony was unnecessary under the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur, i.e., an inference of negligence may be drawn from the fact that the infant was admitted to the PICU wdth healthy legs and discharged from the PICU with fractured legs (Judge Talbot dissented on this issue).<footnotemark>[5]</footnotemark> The case was remanded for trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-8\">Defendants sought leave to appeal the Court of Appeals decision that res ipsa loquitur applies and that expert testimony was not necessary. Plaintiffs sought leave to cross-appeal the Court of Appeals decision that their proposed expert witness was not qualified under MCL 600.2169 to testify against the defendant physician. We heard oral argument on whether to grant the applications <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>or take other peremptory action permitted by MCR 7.302(G)(1).<footnotemark>[6]</footnotemark> <em>[Woodard I, supra, </em>473 Mich at 3-5.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">After hearing oral argument, we issued our opinion in <em>Woodard I, </em>which concerned only defendants\u2019 application for leave to appeal. In that opinion, we reversed the Court of Appeals decision that res ipsa loquitur applied to relieve plaintiffs of the need to present expert testimony.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Because our decision in <em>Woodard I </em>required plaintiffs to produce expert testimony to support their claims, we simultaneously granted plaintiffs\u2019 cross-application for leave to appeal the Court of Appeals determination that their proposed expert was not qualified under MCL 600.2169.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">B. <em>HAMILTON v KULIGOWSKI</em></p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">Between 1992 and 1998, defendant Dr. Mark F. Kuligowski treated Rosalie Ackley for hypertension, diabetes, weight control, and a thyroid ailment. On March 19, 1998, Ackley, who was in her seventies, complained of numbness and weakness in her left arm. She further informed Kuligowski that she had been diagnosed with a blockage in her neck several years earlier. After detecting abnormal sounds in Ackley\u2019s carotid artery during a physical examination, Kuligowski suspected that she had suffered a minor stroke and possibly suffered from bilateral carotid artery disease. Although he ordered a bilateral carotid Doppler echocardiography,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Kuligowski advised Ackley that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>there was no cause for immediate concern. Three days later, Ackley suffered a stroke. She subsequently died in December 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">Plaintiff, Ackley\u2019s daughter, filed the instant medical malpractice action on behalf of Ackley\u2019s estate alleging that Kuligowski was negligent in failing to recognize Ackley\u2019s prestroke symptoms and render appropriate treatment. Kuligowski is board-certified in internal medicine, and primarily sees geriatric patients. In support of her claims, plaintiff called as a witness a proposed expert who, like Kuligowski, is board-certified in internal medicine. Plaintiffs proposed expert spends half of his professional time in his office treating internal medicine and infectious disease patients and the other half in a hospital treating primarily infectious disease patients.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">Kuligowski moved to strike plaintiffs proposed expert, arguing that he was not qualified under MCL 600.2169 to testify with regard to the appropriate standard of care because he specializes in infectious diseases while Kuligowski himself specializes in general internal medicine. The circuit court granted Kuligowski\u2019s motion, ruling that plaintiffs proposed expert was not qualified under MCL 600.2169(l)(b) because he did not devote a majority of his time to the practice of general internal medicine but, instead, to the treatment of infectious diseases. Thereafter, the circuit court also granted Kuligowski\u2019s motion for a directed verdict on the basis that plaintiff did not have a qualified expert to support her claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">The Court of Appeals reversed the trial court\u2019s ruling and held that plaintiffs proposed expert was qualified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>under MCL 600.2169. The panel concluded that the treatment of infectious diseases was merely a \u201csubspecialty\u201d within the broader specialty of internal medicine, and that the statute does not require the matching of subspecialties. It further concluded that, because the treatment of infectious diseases is merely a branch of internal medicine with a narrower focus, plaintiffs proposed expert did, in fact, devote a majority of his time to the practice of internal medicine. The Court of Appeals therefore remanded the case for further proceedings.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">We granted Kuligowski\u2019s application for leave to appeal.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">These cases involve the interpretation of MCL 600.2169. We review questions of statutory interpretation de novo.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> As always, our goal is to discern and give effect to the legislative intent that is expressed in the statutory language.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> If the statutory language is unambiguous, then the Legislature\u2019s intent is clear and we must enforce the statute as written.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b652-8\">Before 1986, the question whether a plaintiffs proposed expert was qualified to testify with regard to the appropriate standard of care in a medical malpractice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>case was governed by MRE 702.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> This evidentiary rule provided trial courts with broad discretion to qualify proposed experts if they determined that scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge was needed to assist the trier of fact in determining the appropriate standard of care the defendant doctor should have met and that the proposed expert was qualified to offer such testimony on the basis of the expert\u2019s \u201c \u2018knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">However, as we discussed in <em>McDougall v Schanz,</em><footnotemark><em>17</em></footnotemark><em> </em>our Legislature ultimately deemed MRE 702 ineffective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>in assuring that proposed experts presented reliable testimony in medical malpractice cases.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The primary deficiency with MRE 702 was that it failed to ensure that trial judges excluded proposed experts who were not actively involved in the medical field about which they sought to testify.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Therefore, in 1986 our Legislature enacted the first version of MCL 600.2169, which was designed to limit a trial court\u2019s discretion to qualify experts in medical malpractice cases by systematically \u201cprecluding] certain witnesses from testifying solely on the basis of the witness\u2019 lack of practice or teaching experience ... .\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b655-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>Our Legislature further limited the discretion of trial judges to qualify proposed experts in 1993 when it enacted 1993 PA 78, which amended MCL 600.2169 to set forth even more restrictive criteria than the 1986 version.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> In its current form, MCL 600.2169 now provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-5\">(1) In an action alleging medical malpractice, a person shall not give expert testimony on the appropriate standard of practice or care unless the person is licensed as a health professional in this state or another state and meets the following criteria:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-6\">(a) If the party against whom or on whose behalf the testimony is offered is a specialist, specializes at the time of the occurrence that is the basis for the action in the same specialty as the party against whom or on whose behalf the testimony is offered. However, if the party against whom or on whose behalf the testimony is offered is a specialist who is board certified, the expert witness must be a specialist who is board certified in that specialty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-7\">(b) Subject to subdivision (c), during the year immediately preceding the date of the occurrence that is the basis for the claim or action, devoted a majority of his or her professional time to either or both of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-8\">(i) The active clinical practice of the same health profession in which the party against whom or on whose behalf the testimony is offered is licensed and, if that party is a specialist, the active clinical practice of that specialty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-9\">(ii) The instruction of students in an accredited health professional school or accredited residency or clinical research program in the same health profession in which the party against whom or on whose behalf the testimony is offered is licensed and, if that party is a specialist, an accredited health professional school or accredited residency or clinical research program in the same specialty.<footnotemark>[22]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>(3) This section does not limit the power of the trial court to disqualify an expert witness on grounds other than the qualifications set forth in this section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">Accordingly, these provisions set forth a number of specific, minimum criteria that a proposed expert must satisfy in order to testify regarding the appropriate standard of care in a medical malpractice case.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The first of these, of course, is that the proposed expert must be a licensed health professional.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The statute then goes on to set forth several additional requirements aimed at ensuring that the proposed expert possesses the same professional credentials as the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>doctor, thereby assuring that the proposed expert is familiar with the standards and techniques that should typically be followed by a physician in the defendant\u2019s position. In particular, the statute requires that if the defendant doctor is a specialist, the proposed expert must also be a specialist in the same specialty. Further, if the defendant doctor is a board-certified specialist, the proposed expert must also be a board-certified specialist in the same specialty.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">Moreover, in addition to requiring that the proposed expert possess the same specialty qualifications as the defendant doctor, the statute, unlike MRE 702, also seeks to ensure that the proposed expert possesses actual, recent experience in that specialty area. It does this by requiring that the proposed expert have devoted a majority of his or her professional time during the year preceding the alleged malpractice to either the active clinical practice of the defendant\u2019s specialty area or the instruction of that specialty area.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">Finally, the statute makes clear that the above requirements represent only the bare <em>minimum </em>that a proposed expert must meet in order to testify regarding the standard of care. It does this by explicitly granting a trial court the discretion to disqualify a proposed expert for other, unenumerated reasons;<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> for example, if the trial court determines that the proposed expert\u2019s testimony is unreliable under MCL 600.2955<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> or the three factors recently added to MRE 702.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>A. \"SPECIALIST\u201d DEFINED</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">As is obvious from the above synopsis of the statute, the determination whether a proposed expert is minimally qualified to testify regarding the appropriate standard of care often turns on whether the defendant doctor qualifies as a specialist in a given area of medicine, thereby requiring the proposed expert to likewise qualify as a specialist in that area. MCL 600.2169, however, does not define the term \u201cspecialist.\u201d It therefore falls upon us to accord a meaning to that term that best comports with the Legislature\u2019s intent. In doing so, we are guided by two principles. The first is that MCL 600.2169 does not stand alone. Rather, \u201c[i]t exists and must be read in context with the entire act, and the words and phrases used there must be assigned such meanings as are in harmony with the whole of the statute . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> The second comes from the Legislature\u2019s decree in MCL 8.3a that undefined words or phrases shall be given their common and ordinary meaning, but that technical words and phrases, and legal terms of art, are to be construed according to their peculiar and appropriate meaning.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">Applying the first of these principles, we first note that some indication regarding the meaning of the term <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>\u201cspecialist\u201d can be gleaned from the relationship of MCL 600.2169 to MCL 600.2912d(l).<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> The latter statute, in conjunction with MCL 600.2169, requires the plaintiffs counsel to file an affidavit of merit with the complaint that is signed by a physician who counsel <em>reasonably believes </em>specializes in the same specialty as the defendant physician.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Accordingly, the Legislature intended for a plaintiff to be able to form a reasonable belief regarding whether a defendant doctor is a specialist at the commencement of the action \u2014 i.e., before the discovery process. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the Legislature intended for the determination whether a defendant doctor is a specialist to correlate to how the defendant doctor subjectively represents himself or herself; in other words, whether the doctor holds himself or herself out as a specialist.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">Further indication of what the Legislature intended when it used the term \u201cspecialist\u201d can be gleaned from dictionary definitions. Because MCL 600.2169 uses the term \u201cspecialist\u201d in the context of a <em>medical </em>specialist, it is a technical term that must be accorded its \u201cpeculiar and appropriate meaning\u201d within the medical community. MCL 8.3a. Accordingly, it is necessary in this instance for us to refer to medical, rather than lay, dictionaries.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>Some medical dictionaries base the determination whether a doctor is a specialist on how that doctor allocates time during practice; in other words, whether that doctor limits his or her practice primarily to a particular branch of medicine or surgery, or to a certain class of patients, organs, or diseases.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Other medical dictionaries, however, define a specialist not according to how the doctor allocates time, but rather according to whether the doctor has advanced training or knowledge in a specific branch of medicine or surgery, or a certain class of patients, organs, or diseases.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>Thus, taking into consideration these technical definitions of the term \u201cspecialty,\u201d as well as the meaning that can be ascribed to it from the relationship of MCL 600.2169 to MCL 600.2912d(l), we conclude that the Legislature intended the term \u201cspecialist\u201d as used in MCL 600.2169 to denote a physician who holds himself or herself out as either (1) limiting his or her practice primarily to a particular branch of medicine or surgery, or to a certain class of patients, organs, or diseases, or (2) having advanced training or knowledge in a specific branch of medicine or surgery, or a certain class of patients, organs, or diseases.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">We note at this point that many areas of specialization contain narrower, more limited areas within them. For instance, a physician who specializes in pediatrics <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>can focus on general pediatric care, or can farther concentrate on the more limited fields of pediatric critical care or neonatal-perinatal care. Similarly, a physician who specializes in internal medicine can focus on general internal medicine or further concentrate his or her practice on any one of numerous, more limited fields such as cardiology, infectious diseases, gastroenterology, nephrology, and so forth. Plaintiffs maintain that the term \u201cspecialty\u201d refers only to those areas of medicine that are recognized and designated as such by the American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS) and the American Osteopathic Association (AOA). Under the ABMS/AOA framework, more generalized fields are termed \u201cspecialties\u201d and more limited fields are termed \u201csubspecialties.\u201d Thus, plaintiffs argue that their proposed experts\u2019 qualifications and the defendant doctors\u2019 qualifications need only match at the broader, more generalized level. They assert that the narrower, more focused areas are not specialties but \u201csubspecialties\u201d under the ABMS/AOA framework and that the language of MCL 600.2169 does not contemplate subspecialties.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">We reject this assertion. The plain language of MCL 600.2169(l)(a) is completely devoid of any indication that the Legislature intended that a physician\u2019s \u201cspecialty\u201d be circumscribed by the designations given by the ABMS and the AOA. Clearly, the unambiguous language of MCL 600.2169(l)(a) contemplates board-certified specialists as well as non-board-certified specialists. Because the statute permits a physician to be a \u201cspecialist\u201d without board certification of <em>any variety, </em>there is no basis to conclude that the designations given by optional certifying organizations dictate a physician\u2019s \u201cspecialist\u201d status.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Moreover, permitting the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>\u201cspecialty\u201d designations given by the ABMS and the AOA to determine a physician\u2019s specialty would render MCL 600.2169(l)(c) nugatory. Because both certifying boards award specialty certification in family medicine,<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> every general practitioner would be considered a \u201cspecialist\u201d and subject to the expert witness requirements of MCL 600.2169(l)(a) instead of the expert witness requirements applicable to generalists under \u00a7 2169(l)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">Instead, we turn to the generally accepted technical meaning of the term \u201cspecialty,\u201d which encompasses narrower, more focused areas of medical practice, qualifying them as specialties in and of themselves.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Thus, because the broader, more generalized areas and the narrower, more limited areas within them both constitute specialties under the accepted technical meaning of the word \u201cspecialty,\u201d a plaintiffs proposed expert must match the defendant doctor\u2019s qualifications at both levels.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b664-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>B. \u201cBOARD-CERTIFIED\u201d DEFINED</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">Once it is determined that a defendant doctor qualifies as a specialist in a given area, the next inquiry is whether he or she also qualifies as a board-certified specialist in that area. Before defining what it means to be board-certified, however, one point bears emphasis. That is that the statute does not require the matching of board certifications in and of themselves. Rather, it only makes board certifications germane if the defendant doctor is a <em>\u201cspecialist </em>who is board certified.\u201d Accordingly, the fact that a defendant doctor has obtained a board certification in a given area is irrelevant to the issue of credential matching unless the defendant doctor first qualifies as a specialist in that area.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">Like with the term \u201cspecialty,\u201d the Legislature did not define the phrase \u201cboard certified\u201d in MCL 600.2169. Because of this, the plaintiffs in both these cases have argued that we should read MCL 600.2169 <em>in pari materia </em>with MCL 333.2701(a) of the Public Health Code, which defines \u201cboard certified\u201d as \u201ccertified to practice in a particular medical specialty by a national board recognized by the American board of medical specialties [ABMS] or the American osteopathic association [AOA].\u201d Accordingly, plaintiffs urge this Court to hold that a proposed expert need only match a defendant doctor\u2019s board certification if that certification was issued by the ABMS or the AOA.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">We decline to impute the definition of \u201cboard certified\u201d from MCL 333.2701(a) to MCL 600.2169 for several reasons. First, the Legislature made clear that the definition of \u201cboard certified\u201d set forth in MCL 333.2701(a) applies only to the Public Health Code by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>prefacing it with the statement <em>\u201cAs used in this part </em>[of the Public Health Code]... \u2018Board certified\u2019 means ...(Emphasis added.) Especially in light of such clear words of limitation, we must presume that the Legislature intended that the definition of \u201cboard certified\u201d set forth in MCL 333.2701(a) would not be applied to other statutes using the same phrase.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> Second, statutes are only read <em>in pari materia </em>when they relate to the same subject or share a common purpose,<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> and not when, as here, their scope and aim are distinct and unconnected.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> The Legislature\u2019s purpose in enacting the Public Health Code was to protect the public health, safety, and welfare,<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> by regulating the persons, facilities, and agencies that affect them. Its purpose in enacting the Revised Judicature Act, of which MCL 600.2169 is a part, was to set forth the organization and jurisdiction of the judiciary and to effect procedural improvements in civil and criminal actions.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> MCL 600.2169 fulfills this purpose by setting minimum requirements for proposed experts to ensure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>that proof of medical malpractice \u201c \u2018emanate[s] from sources of reliable character,\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> and is unrelated to protecting the health, safety, and welfare of the general public.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">We thus fall back on the general rule set forth in MCL 8.3a that undefined, technical phrases are to be construed and understood according to their peculiar and appropriate meaning. We also keep in mind that if the Legislature had wanted to limit the definition of \u201cboard certified\u201d in MCL 600.2169 only to certification by specific organizations it would have done so explicitly, as it did in MCL 333.2701(a).<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> Doing so, we adopt the definition of \u201cboard certified\u201d set forth by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of New York,<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> which has defined that term as denoting \u201ca credential bestowed by a national, independent medical board indicating proficiency in a medical specialty.\u201d<footnotemark>49</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b667-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>As we did above with regard to the \u201cspecialty\u201d versus \u201csubspecialty\u201d dispute, it is again necessary for us to resolve a question that arises in most cases as a result of nomenclature often used to distinguish between certifications offered for broad specialty areas and certifications offered for the narrower subspecialty areas. Specifically, certifications coinciding with the broader specialty areas are often referred to by parties and in case law as board certifications, while certifications coinciding with the narrower specialty areas are referred to as \u201ccertificates of special qualifications\u201d or \u201ccertificates of added qualifications.\u201d The result is that in many cases, such as <em>Woodard, </em>plaintiffs will argue that certificates of special qualifications are not board certifications that need to be matched. We clarify, however, that under the above definition of the phrase \u201cboard certified,\u201d any difference between what are traditionally referred to as board certifications and what have commonly been called certificates of special qualifications is merely one of semantics. When a certificate of special qualifications is a credential bestowed by a national, independent medical board indicating proficiency in a medical specialty, it is itself a board certification that must be matched.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-4\">C. WHETHER ALL SPECIALTIES AND BOARD CERTIFICATIONS MUST BE MATCHED</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">Because many defendant doctors specialize in more than one area, or have become board-certified special<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>ists in more than one area, the question often arises whether MCL 600.2169 requires that a proposed plaintiffs expert match <em>all </em>the defendant doctor\u2019s specialties and board certifications. In <em>Tate v Detroit Receiving </em>Hosp,<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> our Court of Appeals answered this question in the negative. Relying primarily on the statute\u2019s mandate that a proposed expert must \u201c \u2018specialize[] <em>at the time of the occurrence that is the basis of the action </em>\u2019 \u201d in the same specialty as the defendant doctor,<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> the <em>Tate </em>panel concluded that MCL 600.2169 \u201cshould be read so as to allow an expert to testify if that expert [specializes in or] is [a] board certified [specialist] in the same specialty being practiced by the [defendant] health professional <em>at the time </em>of the alleged malpractice.\u201d<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> While we generally agree with the result reached by the Court of Appeals in <em>Tate, </em>we disavow its rationale.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">The primary flaw with the Court of Appeals holding in <em>Tate </em>is that it bases its conclusion regarding what expert testimony is required on the language of MCL 600.2169. By its plain terms, however, MCL 600.2169 <em>never </em>requires a plaintiff to introduce expert testimony with regard to the standard of care. Instead, it merely states that if a plaintiff needs to introduce expert testimony to establish the appropriate standard of care, the expert introduced must meet the requirements set forth in the statute. Thus, the issue whether a plaintiff needs to introduce expert testimony at all, and, if so, whether the plaintiff needs to introduce expert testimony concerning the standard of care applicable to all the defendant doctor\u2019s specialties and board certifications, depends not on MCL 600.2169, but on the spe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>cialties and board certifications that are put into issue by the parties during the pleading and discovery process. To illustrate this point, we provide the following hypothetical examples:</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">1. Assume a plaintiff sues a doctor who has five specialties, but asserts in the complaint and accompanying affidavit of merit that the defendant doctor should have met the standard of care coinciding with only one of the defendant doctor\u2019s specialties, and that the defendant doctor\u2019s other four specialties are irrelevant to establishing and understanding that standard of care. Further assume that, in the answer, the defendant doctor admits that the plaintiff has asserted the appropriate standard of care, further admits that the challenged actions did not conform to it, and only contests the amount of damages.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> In this situation, the plaintiff need not present expert testimony regarding the standard of care at trial. The plaintiff need only offer evidence regarding damages. MCL 600.2169 is thus inapplicable. The result would be the same in a case where a plaintiff is able to successfully avail himself or herself of the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">2. Assume again that the plaintiff sues a doctor who has five specialties, and again asserts in the complaint and accompanying affidavit that the defendant doctor should have met the standard of care coinciding with only one of the defendant doctor\u2019s specialties, and that the defendant doctor\u2019s other four specialties are irrelevant to establishing and understanding that standard of care. This time, the defendant doctor admits in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>answer and accompanying affidavit that the plaintiff has asserted the correct standard of care, but asserts that the challenged actions conformed to it. In this case, MCL 600.2169 applies because the plaintiff will need to introduce \u201cexpert testimony on the appropriate standard of practice or care\u201d in order to prove that the defendant doctor\u2019s actions did not conform to it. However, because the defendant doctor has conceded that only one of the five specialties is germane to the appropriate standard of care, the plaintiffs proposed expert only has to comply with the mandates of MCL 600.2169 with regard to that one specialty.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\">3. Assume again that the plaintiff sues a doctor who has five specialties, and again asserts in the complaint and accompanying affidavit that the defendant doctor should have met the standard of care coinciding with only one of the defendant doctor\u2019s specialties, and that the defendant doctor\u2019s other four specialties are irrelevant to establishing and understanding that standard of care. Assume this time that the defendant doctor, instead of admitting that the plaintiff has asserted the appropriate standard of care, asserts that the standard of care coinciding with one of the other specialties is the one the defendant should have met. In this situation, unless the plaintiff agrees with the defendant, the plaintiff will need to present expert testimony, concerning the standards of care applicable to two of the defendant doctor\u2019s five specialties \u2014 the one that the plaintiff asserts is applicable and the one that the defendant asserts is applicable. No testimony regarding the standard of care for the defendant doctor\u2019s other three specialties will be needed because the defendant has conceded that they do not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>In this third hypothetical, the plaintiff will need to present two types of expert testimony: testimony to prove that the standard of care asserted by the defendant doctor <em>does not </em>apply, and testimony to establish the standard of care the plaintiff believes is applicable and how the defendant breached it. This, of course, raises the question whether MCL 600.2169 requires the plaintiff to produce one expert qualified to offer testimony in both areas. We hold that it does not; rather, it allows a plaintiff to produce multiple experts, each matching the defendant doctor\u2019s credentials with regard to one specialty area, in order to fulfill the burden.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> The reason is that MCL 600.2169(l)(b) requires a plaintiffs proposed expert to have devoted a majority of his or her professional time during the year immediately preceding the alleged malpractice to either the active clinical practice of, or the teaching of, the specialty about which the expert will testify. The statute does not impose a similar burden on the defendant doctor. Thus, while a defendant doctor can offer testimony regarding the appropriate standard of care for more than one specialty area, it would be impossible under the statute for a plaintiff to present one expert to likewise testify regarding the appropriate standard of care for more than one specialty area. It is a fundamental rule of statutory interpretation that statutes should be given a reasonable construction based on the legislative intent that can be inferred from their words.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>construction of MCL 600.2169 that would render compliance impossible would not be reasonable.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">D. RESPONSE TO THE JUSTICE MARKMAN LEAD OPINION SIGNED BY JUSTICES CAVANAGH, KELLY, AND WEAVER, WHICH WE CONSIDER A DISSENT</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">The lead opinion\u2019s interpretation of MCL 600.2169(1), as we understand it, is that it represents a legislative determination that in all cases <em>only one </em>of the defendant doctor\u2019s specialties will be relevant to establishing the standard of care he or she should have met. Therefore, the justices in the lead opinion assert that the statute directs the trial court to determine, at the beginning stages of a lawsuit, exactly which specialty area the defendant doctor was practicing at the time of the alleged malpractice and to limit the expert testimony that may be presented to the jury only to testimony regarding the standard of care commensurate with that specialty area, or what the lead opinion terms the \u201crelevant\u201d specialty. However, the lead opinion\u2019s interpretation is not grounded in the statutory language. Furthermore, its effect is to allow the trial court in the name of culling out the irrelevant to really exercise a power of theory preclusion with regard to both plaintiffs and defendants heretofore unknown in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>our jurisprudence. In doing so, it will deny in given cases either a plaintiff or a defendant doctor his or her constitutional right to have a jury determine factual matters, weigh evidence, and assess credibility. This result will collide with the due process right under our Constitution of a party to present the theories it has as long as there is sufficient evidence to support each theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\">The biggest problem with the lead opinion\u2019s interpretation of the statute is that it misunderstands completely the traditional roles played by the judge and jury in the trial process. Juries find facts so as to evaluate the theories of the parties. Judges, among other things, keep out evidence that is irrelevant to the proving of the theories. If the parties cannot produce evidence sufficient for a reasonable juror to decide the case on the basis of a certain theory, the jury is precluded by the judge from considering that theory. This preclusion however cannot come before proofs are presented or it is shown that there are no such facts by a properly pleaded motion for summary disposition or similar motion. A simple example to demonstrate this, albeit from another context, may be helpful. Let us assume that sometime after construction is completed a building collapses. In such a case, if the owner sues the architect on the theory of malpractice, the architect could defend by saying he or she was not the cause because he or she was not negligent but that the real cause was perhaps the negligence of the construction engineers, defectively manufactured materials, or even that there was an act of God, say, an earthquake. These alternative explanations, or theories, of how the building collapsed of course would either be factually supportable or not. If there was evidence to support them, they would be submitted to the jury for sorting out. This opportunity to support a party\u2019s theory with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>evidence cannot be precluded at the initiation stage of the lawsuit. It only can be done by a motion asserting that there is no genuine issue of material fact pursuant to MCR 2.116(0(10), or a similar type of pretrial motion, or at the close of a party\u2019s proofs at trial where insufficient facts have been submitted. In no case, however, could the theories be described, as the lead opinion does, as relevant or irrelevant. The theories only give alternative views regarding how things happened. The words, relevant or irrelevant, can only apply to the supporting evidence for the theories. In any case, to complete the example, under the lead opinion\u2019s thinking, in our hypothetical case a court could hold that the earthquake theory is irrelevant and preclude testimony on it immediately after the answer was filed and before there was any opportunity to even secure or present supporting facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">The problem the hypothetical points out is the problem the lead opinion will create in medical malpractice cases also. For instance, if a doctor who specializes in cardiovascular surgery and nephrology<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> negligently inserts a pacemaker, the trial court should not be able to preclude either the plaintiff or the defendant from arguing that the defendant\u2019s specialty in nephrology was or was not implicated by the procedure as long as the parties can produce reliable<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> expert testimony to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>support their theories. If they do, they should be allowed to present their theories to the jury for it to make the factual determination of which specialty or specialties were implicated by the procedure. Yet, under the lead opinion\u2019s approach, if the trial judge determines after the defendant\u2019s answer is filed that one party\u2019s theory regarding which specialty explains the standard of care is \u201cirrelevant,\u201d no proofs are allowed on it. Never, before today, has a theory in this or any other litigation of which we are aware been itself declared unpresentable without regard to the evidence to support it. What the lead opinion is doing is not a relevancy exercise. The only \u201crelevancy\u201d question for the trial court would be whether the proffered testimony has any tendency to make it more or less probable that the procedure the defendant doctor performed implicated one or more of his or her specialty areas. But this is not the decision the lead opinion wants the trial court to make. The lead opinion wants to let the trial court determine the factual question whether the pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>cedure performed by the defendant doctor did, in fact, implicate one or more of the doctor\u2019s specialty areas. This <em>is not </em>a relevance question, no matter how adamant the lead opinion is in trying to characterize it as one. Rather, it is an exercise of explanatory theory preclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">By allowing such theory preclusion, the lead opinion\u2019s analysis allows in a medical malpractice case the trial court, rather than the jury, to determine the factual issue of which specialty or specialties the defendant doctor was practicing at the time of the alleged malpractice. <em>Ante </em>at 558-560. This plainly disrupts the historical dynamic of our trial process, whereby factual determinations are to be made by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">The historical division of functions between the court and the jury needs no citation of authority. It is the province of the jury to determine questions of fact and assess the credibility of witnesses.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">Not only will the lead opinion\u2019s analysis take factual determinations out of the province of the jury, it will also foreclose the jury from assessing credibility and weighing evidence. A good example on the credibility issue can be seen in <em>Woodard. </em>Defendant Custer has argued throughout the proceedings in this case that the procedures he performed implicate the specialty of pediatric critical care. It is the case, however, that plaintiffs proffered expert, Anthony Casamassima, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>M.D., who specializes in general pediatrics, testified in his deposition that he performed the same procedures on infants the same age as Austin Woodard during his residency.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> On the basis of this testimony, plaintiffs have asserted that although such procedures were performed by a critical care specialist in this case, they do not necessarily implicate the specialty of critical care medicine. Under our analysis of the statute, if plaintiffs had presented their own critical care specialist meeting the criteria of MCL 600.2169(1) to support proffered expert Casamassima\u2019s testimony that these procedures do not implicate the specialty of critical care, the testimony from all three doctors (Woodard, Casamassima, and plaintiffs critical care specialist) would be presented to the jury. The jury, after hearing this testimony, would evaluate the credibility of each doctor, determine how much weight should be given each doctor\u2019s testimony, and make a factual determination regarding the theories so as to determine whether the procedures performed by defendant Custer do, in fact, implicate the specialty of pediatric critical care and the standard of care commensurate with it or, rather, merely implicate the specialty of general pediatrics and its commensurate standard of care. This is the jury\u2019s traditional function.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> The lead opinion, however, does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>not even mention proffered expert Casamassima\u2019s testimony. Instead, it concludes without discussing it that Custer was \u201cpracticing pediatric critical care medicine ....\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 576.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> How do they know? To say it was one or the other specialty is not a determination concerning relevance but a choice of which it was after considering evidence.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">Even more troubling at a less theoretical plane than the theory-preclusion role that the lead opinion gives to the trial court is how this will be practically implemented. There are puzzling questions to which the lead opinion provides no answers. For example, consider the following difficulties. In the case where there are mul<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>tiple specialties claimed, the trial court would have to have a hearing very soon after the defendant\u2019s answer is filed so that the parties can get the decision by the judge of what the \u201crelevant\u201d specialty is so they can secure experts. Yet, at that point, there will be no depositions and probably not even reports, at least for the defendant doctor who just got sued. How is the trial judge to determine which specialties are \u201crelevant\u201d without expert testimony gained from depositions?<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> Moreover, reports, if there are any, are hearsay. How is that dealt with? Further, once the decision is made by the trial court, how does the loser proceed if that party, plaintiff or defendant or maybe even both, thinks the trial court got it wrong? Does he or she make an application for interlocutory leave to appeal in the Court of Appeals? Even if the Court of Appeals does grant the interlocutory leave to appeal, if the trial court\u2019s decision is affirmed and this Court will not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>review the case (which is very likely), does the loser then get to create a separate record in the trial court regarding his or her theory \u2014 the theory that the jury never heard?<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> If he or she is allowed a separate record (and how could he or she not be?), surely the opposing party will defend even on that separate record with their own experts. Where is the economy in this approach, which approach was, as advanced by the lead opinion, to stop the needless expense of having to secure \u201cirrelevant\u201d experts? Further, when the jury has heard only one theory regarding the standard of care and specialty at issue and an appeal of its decision is taken, is the earlier interlocutory holding (if there was one) res judicata? If it is not binding, or if there was no interlocutory appeal granted, how is the Court of Appeals, or eventually this Court, to analyze the factual dispute, at that stage or for that matter interlocutorily, with regard to the vying theories of \u201crelevant specialties\u201d and, thus, differing standards of care? Appellate courts will have no basis for a decision on that factual issue or issues. These conundrums all come from the fact that the justices in the lead opinion misunderstand what they are calling on judges to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">At another level, constitutional rather than merely practical, the lead opinion\u2019s theory-preclusion approach <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>denies a defendant doctor the right to procedural due process. This, of course, violates the United States Constitution and Michigan Constitution, which provide that no person (such as one being sued) shall be deprived of \u201clife, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\u201d<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> Said simply, this means that the Court must allow the defendant doctor an effective opportunity to defend the action, which entitles the defendant to confront adverse witnesses, to call his or her own witnesses, and to present evidence and arguments.<footnotemark>67</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">But the lead opinion\u2019s theory-preclusion analysis prevents a defendant doctor from arguing, and introducing evidence to prove, that more than one of his or her specialty areas is germane to establishing the appropriate standard of care. It also precludes the doctor from arguing that the plaintiffs proposed expert does not know what standard of care the defendant doctor should have followed because the proposed expert does not possess the same specialties and has not spent the requisite time practicing or teaching those specialties. Thus, the lead opinion\u2019s interpretation of the statute allows the trial court to prevent the defendant from introducing evidence, making arguments, and cross-examining witnesses, i.e., presenting a defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">Further, the lead opinion\u2019s theory-preclusion analysis will also adversely affect plaintiffs. That is, the justices in the lead opinion appear to believe that it will always be defendants who assert that multiple specialties are germane to establishing the appropriate standard of care, perhaps as some sort of gaming tactic. See <em>Ante </em>at 568. We, however, do not believe that this will always be the case. For example, if a defendant doctor is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>a specialist in two areas, a plaintiff may wish to argue that the combination of the defendant\u2019s specialization in both areas imposes a higher standard of care on the defendant than the standards of care applicable to the individual areas. Under our interpretation of the statute, the plaintiff is allowed to argue to the jury that the higher standard of care applies, as long as he or she can produce experts who satisfy the criteria of MCL 600.2169(1) for both areas. Under the lead opinion\u2019s interpretation of the statute, however, the plaintiff cannot present such an argument to the jury. Rather, the trial court would determine that only the standard of care applicable to one of the specialty areas is the \u201crelevant\u201d one, thereby precluding the plaintiff from arguing to the jury that the higher standard of care applies. Thus, the lead opinion\u2019s interpretation of the statute will not only deny defendants the right to present a complete defense, but will also limit the theories that plaintiffs can present to the jury. Do the justices in the lead opinion believe that this is without possible constitutional implications?</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">All of these problems with the lead opinion\u2019s analysis stem from the fact that the justices in the lead opinion repeat the same error made by the Court of Appeals in <em>Tate. </em>That is, they rely on MCL 600.2169(1) to answer the question of what expert testimony is needed. However, as we explained above, the statute was never intended to, and indeed does not, address that issue. Nowhere in MCL 600.2169(1) did the Legislature attempt to address <em>whether </em>a plaintiff needs to produce expert testimony with regard to a particular standard of care. Rather, as we explained in <em>McDougall, </em>the Legislature\u2019s purpose in enacting MCL 600.2169 was to ensure that <em>if </em>a plaintiff needs to produce expert testimony regarding a particular standard of care, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>expert testimony \u201c \u2018 emanate [s] from sources of reliable character .. .\u201d<footnotemark>68</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b683-4\">In misinterpreting MCL 600.2169(1) as resolving the question <em>whether </em>expert testimony is needed with regard to a particular standard of care, the lead opinion first notes that the statute states that a proffered expert shall not testify regarding \u201cthe <em>appropriate </em>standard of practice or care\u201d unless he or she satisfies the listed criteria. The lead opinion incorrectly construes this as a legislative determination that the plaintiff only has to produce expert testimony establishing the standard of care coinciding with what the lead opinion terms \u201cthe relevant\u201d specialty area, i.e., the standard of care applicable to the specialty area that the defendant doctor was practicing at the time of the malpractice. We believe the lead opinion\u2019s construction is erroneous because expert testimony regarding \u201cthe <em>appropriate </em>standard of practice or care\u201d <em>necessarily includes </em>testimony about whether a particular procedure implicates a certain specialty area and, therefore, the standard of care applicable to that specialty area.<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> In other words, what the statute clearly says is that a proffered expert cannot testify with regard to what specialty area the defendant doctor was practicing and the standard of care commen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>surate with that specialty unless the proposed expert meets the requirements of MCL 600.2169(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">We also disagree with the lead opinion\u2019s reliance on the use of terms such as \u201cthe same specialty,\u201d \u201cthat specialty,\u201d \u201ca person,\u201d and \u201cthe person\u201d in MCL 600.2169(l)(a) for the proposition that a plaintiff need only present expert testimony regarding the standard of care applicable to one of the defendant doctor\u2019s specialty areas. We agree with the lead opinion that these phrases are written in the singular. But our construction of the statute does not, as the lead opinion believes, require reading them in the plural. Said simply, the fact that the plaintiff may need to produce multiple experts concerning the applicability or nonapplicability of multiple standards of care does not change the fact that each proffered expert is \u201ca person\u201d who must match the defendant doctor\u2019s qualifications with respect to \u201cthat specialty\u201d that he or she is called to testify about.<footnotemark>70</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">The sum of all of this is that the lead opinion\u2019s interpretation of MCL 600.2169(1) does not follow from its plain language. It also allows the trial court to perform functions that are solely within the province of the jury, such as making credibility and factual determinations. Moreover, it effectively denies a defendant doctor his or her due process right to present a defense, and precludes plaintiffs from presenting supportable theories. We do not believe that such an interpretation of the statute is a reasonable one and we believe that it likely is an unconstitutional approach. Therefore, we cannot join it.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>E. ANALYSIS OF THE EFFECT OF JUSTICE MARKMAN\u2019S HAVING SIGNED BOTH THE LEAD OPINION AND HIS CONCURRENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">We find Justice Markman\u2019s interpretation of the statute perplexing. He purports to concur in the lead opinion\u2019s conclusion that MCL 600.2169(1) requires the trial court to choose one, and only one, specialty that is germane to establishing the appropriate standard of care and to preclude the parties from introducing expert testimony regarding other specialties claimed to be relevant. Inconsistently, he then argues in his concurrence that under MCL 600.2169(2) and (3) and MRE 702 the trial court may determine that <em>more than one </em>specialty is relevant and allow the parties to introduce expert testimony with regard to those other relevant specialties.<footnotemark>71</footnotemark> These positions are incompatible. Simply stated, the concurrence does not concur but disagrees. It should be a dissent. Because the concurrence, which must have been written after the lead opinion and thus is later in time, has been joined in part by the three justices signing this opinion, we believe it now becomes a de facto majority opinion.<footnotemark>72</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b686-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>IV APPLICATION</p>\n<p id=\"AM0\">A. <em>WOODARD v CUSTER</em></p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">It is undisputed that defendant Custer holds himself out as limiting his practice primarily to, and having advanced training in, the fields of pediatric critical care and neonatal-perinatal medicine. He therefore qualifies as a specialist in both of those areas.<footnotemark>73</footnotemark> Further, under the definition we have set forth above, Custer qualifies as a board-certified specialist in both of these areas. Plaintiffs\u2019 proposed expert, however, only qualifies as a board-certified expert in general pediatric care.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">Throughout the proceedings in this case, Custer asserted that the specialty areas of pediatric critical care and neonatal-perinatal medicine were germane to establishing and understanding the standard of care that he should have followed when treating plaintiffs\u2019 son in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit. Plaintiffs, however, failed to present experts qualified to testify <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>that the specialties of pediatric critical care and neonatal-perinatal medicine were not relevant to establishing and understanding the standard of care that Custer should have met. Rather, their proposed expert was only qualified to testify regarding the standard of care coinciding with the specialty area they asserted was relevant, general pediatrics. Accordingly, because plaintiffs needed three expert witnesses and only presented one, they failed to present sufficient expert testimony to establish the appropriate standard of care. The trial court thus properly dismissed their lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">B. <em>HAMILTON v KULIGOWSKI</em></p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">Defendant Kuligowski holds himself out as limiting his practice primarily to, and having advanced training in, general internal medicine. He therefore qualifies as a specialist in that field.<footnotemark>74</footnotemark> Further, because it is undisputed that he has obtained board certification in general internal medicine, he qualifies as a board-certified specialist in that field.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">Although he does not hold himself out as limiting his practice primarily to that field, plaintiffs proposed expert holds himself out as having advanced training or knowledge in general internal medicine. Further, he is board-certified in that field and therefore qualifies as a board-certified specialist in general internal medicine. Thus, were he only required to meet the requirements of MCL 600.2169(l)(a), plaintiffs proposed expert would be qualified to testify regarding the appropriate standard of care that Kuligowski should have met because plaintiffs proposed expert was a board-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>certified specialist in the same specialty as Kuligowski at the time of the alleged malpractice.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">Plaintiffs difficulties, however, stem from the fact that her proposed expert also qualifies as a specialist in the field of infectious diseases, and admittedly spent a majority of his professional time during the year preceding the alleged malpractice in the active clinical practice of infectious diseases rather than general internal medicine. Thus, plaintiffs proposed expert fails to meet the requirements of MCL 600.2169(l)(b). Accordingly, the trial court properly granted Kuligowski\u2019s motion to strike plaintiffs proposed expert. Further, because the result was that plaintiff failed to present needed qualified expert testimony to support her lawsuit, the trial court correctly granted Kuligowski\u2019s motion for a directed verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">V CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">The trial courts in both these cases properly held that plaintiffs\u2019 proposed experts were not qualified under MCL 600.2169 to testify regarding the appropriate standard of care that the defendant doctors should have met.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">In <em>Woodard, </em>a majority of the Court of Appeals properly affirmed the trial court\u2019s determination that plaintiffs\u2019 proposed expert was not qualified. Thus, because plaintiffs failed to present expert testimony sufficient to support their claims, and because we have already held that the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur does not relieve plaintiffs of this burden,<footnotemark>75</footnotemark> we affirm the part of the judgment of the Court of Appeals that held that plaintiffs\u2019 expert was not qualified and remand the case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>to the circuit court for reinstatement of the circuit court\u2019s order dismissing plaintiffs\u2019 claim with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">In <em>Hamilton, </em>the Court of Appeals improperly reversed the judgment of the circuit court and held that plaintiffs proposed expert was qualified under MCL 600.2169. We therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case to the circuit court for reinstatement of the circuit court\u2019s order granting a directed verdict to defendant Kuligowski.</p>\n<judges id=\"b689-6\">Corrigan and Young, JJ., concurred with Taylor, C.J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b646-7\"> We do not, however, agree with his conclusion that the trial court, rather than the parties themselves or the jury, is to determine which specialties are germane.

Thus, in order to present expert testimony that a particular specialty area is germane to establishing the appropriate standard of care, a party not only needs to establish that its proposed expert meets the credential and experience requirements of MCL 600.2169(1), but <em>also </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>that the expert\u2019s opinion is based on proven theories and methodologies, i.e., that it is not based on \u201cjunk science.\u201d <em>Gilbert v DaimlerChrysler Corp, </em>470 Mich 749, 779-783; 685 NW2d 391 (2004); see also MCL 600.2955; <em>Craig v Oakwood Hosp, </em>471 Mich 67, 78-80; 684 NW2d 296 (2004). The lead opinion appears to overlook this fact and, thus, seems to think that under our analysis parties, particularly defendants, will be able to assert that any specialty is germane to establishing the standard of care.</p>\n<p id=\"AGu\">The lead opinion responds to this by asserting that we are \u201cconfusing relevancy and reliability.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 568 n 14. That is not the case. What we are stating is that a party must present rehable expert testimony to prove that a specialty area is germane to establishing the standard of care. The lead opinion dismisses this by asking why a party should have to introduce evidence concerning an irrelevant specialty. We would ask in response how exactly it is that a specialty area can be dismissed as irrelevant when rehable expert testimony has been presented that it was implicated by the procedure performed and, thus, is germane to understanding the standard of care the defendant doctor should have exercised.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"59\">\n<p id=\"b676-8\"> <em>People v Lemmon, </em>456 Mich 625, 636-637; 576 NW2d 129 (1998); see also <em>Page v Stanley, </em>242 Mich 326, 330; 218 NW 673 (1928). That factual determinations are solely within the province of the jury is not only a matter of historical happenstance, it is also guaranteed by the Michigan Constitution. Specifically, Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 14 provides that, when demanded, the defendant has a right to a jury trial.

The fact that a particular procedure is performed in a PICU on a critically ill patient, however, does not necessarily mean that <em>that </em>particular procedure implicates the specialty of critical care medicine. As an example, the mere fact that a critical care specialist practicing in a PICU inserts an IV into the arm of a critically ill patient does not in and of itself make the insertion of IVs a procedure implicating the doctor\u2019s specialty in critical care medicine.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"63\">\n<p id=\"b678-8\"> The lead opinion claims that it knows Custer was practicing pediatric critical care medicine \u201cbecause all of the admissible evidence supports the trial court\u2019s finding that the defendant physician was practicing pediatric critical care medicine at the time of the alleged malpractice.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 576 n 19. That is not the case because Cassamassima\u2019s testimony was admissible to prove that he, a specialist in general pediatric care, performed such procedures during his residency. From this testimony, and the context in which it was elicited, the jury could reasonably infer that it is relatively common for doctors who practice only general pediatric care to perform the procedures in this case and that a specialty in pediatric critical care is not required to understand the standard of care that should have been followed. The lead opinion, however, simply concludes without considering this testimony that these procedures require a specialty in pediatric critical care to perform and then, on the basis of that conclusion, asserts that Cassamassima\u2019s testimony is not admissible because it was not offered by a specialist in pediatric critical care.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"64\">\n<p id=\"b679-6\"> The justices in the lead opinion seem to believe that the trial court \u2022will simply be able to determine at the beginning stages of trial, without expert testimony, whether a particular procedure implicates a particular specialty. We find this curious given this Court\u2019s historical recognition that expert testimony is almost always needed to establish the standard of care in medical malpractice actions because it is something that is not within the common purview of jurors or the court. <em>Woodard I, supra, </em>473 Mich at 6; <em>Bryant v Oakpointe Villa Nursing Centre, Inc, </em>471 Mich 411, 422-423; 684 NW2d 864 (2004). The justices in the lead opinion respond by asserting that expert testimony probably will not be required in most cases. However, contrary to the lead opinion\u2019s belief, most cases probably will not be as simple as choosing between cardiovascular surgery and podiatry because most defendant doctors\u2019 specialties will be closely related. The lead opinion also accuses us of \u201cignoring the distinction between determining which specialty is relevant and determining the appropriate standard of care,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 569 n 15, and asserts that expert testimony will only be needed to determine the standard of care, not the specialty or specialty areas implicated by a procedure. How, exactly, will a trial judge with no medical training determine whether a particular procedure implicates such interrelated specialties as pediatric critical care medicine or neonatal-perinatal care medicine, or both.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"65\">\n<p id=\"b680-6\"> Strangely, the lead opinion asserts that a separate record will not be necessary because all the defendant doctor will have to do to preserve the issue is object on the ground that the plaintiffs expert does not specialize in the \u201crelevant\u201d specialty. <em>Ante </em>at 574-575. The lead opinion misses the point. The issue on appeal will not be whether the proposed expert specializes in the specialty area the trial court determined was the \u201crelevant\u201d one. Rather, the issue will be whether the trial court chose the correct specialty as the \u201crelevant\u201d one. There will be no way for an appellate court to assess that determination without a record being made containing expert testimony regarding which specialty areas were implicated by the procedure the defendant doctor performed, just as there is no way for a trial court to make the determination in the first instance without such a record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"66\">\n<p id=\"b681-7\"> US Const, Am Xiy \u00a71; Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 17.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"67\">\n<p id=\"b681-8\"> <em>Bundo v Walled Lake, </em>395 Mich 679, 696; 238 NW2d 154 (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"68\">\n<p id=\"b683-5\"> <em>McDougall, supra </em>(Taylor, EJ., dissenting), 461 Mich at 36, quoting <em>McDougall, </em>218 Mich App at 518.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"69\">\n<p id=\"b683-6\"> The word \u201cappropriate,\u201d which can he defined by reference to an ordinary dictionary because it is a common, rather than technical, term, means \u201c[s]uitable for a particular person, condition, occasion, or place; proper; fitting.\u201d <em>The American Heritage Dictionary: Second College Edition </em>(1982).

But, Justice Markman agrees with both the lead opinion and this opinion that the practice and teaching requirements in MCL 600.2169(l)(b) preclude any proffered expert from being able to testify about more than one specialty area. Thus, because he states in his concurrence that plaintiffs can be obligated to produce expert testimony regarding more than one specialty area, it logically follows that plaintiffs must he able to utilize more than one expert, just as we have concluded in this opinion.

In doing so, he states, \u201cWhile the majority opinion holds that under \u00a7 2169(1) only the one most relevant specialty must match, this does not mean that a different provision of law cannot require that other relevant specialties be matched.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 583. Justice Markman apparently does not see the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>inconsistency in arguing that there can only be one relevant specialty and, at the same time, arguing that there can be more than one. He also apparently does not realize that his argument that \u201cdifferent provision[s] of law\u201d require more than one specialty to match defeats the lead opinion\u2019s argument that MCL 600.2169(1) mandates that there can be only one \u201crelevant\u201d specialty and, in the process, renders nugatory every word and clause of MCL 600.2169(1) that the lead opinion relies on for the conclusion that there can be only one \u201crelevant\u201d specialty. Furthermore, Justice Markman fails to explain how it is reasonable to interpret MCL 600.2169(1) as mandating that there be only one relevant specialty but, simultaneously, saying that experts proffered to testify about other specialty areas must meet the requirements of MCL 600.2169(1).
