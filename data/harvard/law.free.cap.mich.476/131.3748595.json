This case involves a conflict between the legislative branch\u2019s exercise of the \u201clegislative power\u201d to appropriate and to tax, and the judicial branch\u2019s inherent power to compel sufficient appropriations to allow the judiciary to carry out its essential judicial functions. Specifically, the Trial Court seeks to compel the defendant counties to appropriate funding for the enhanced pension and retiree health care plans it deems necessary to recruit and retain adequate staff to allow it to carry out its essential judicial functions. The circuit judge found in favor of the Trial Court, holding that the benefits were \u201creasonable and necessary\u201d to the court\u2019s ability to perform its constitutional responsibilities and that the counties created for them<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>selves a contractual obligation to appropriate funds for the enhanced pension and retiree health care plans. The Court of Appeals affirmed. Because we conclude that such benefits were not \u201creasonable and necessary\u201d to the \u201cserviceability\u201d of the court, and because we conclude that the defendant counties were not contractually obligated to appropriate funds for the enhanced benefits plan sought by the Trial Court, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand this case to the circuit judge for entry of a judgment in favor of defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">The Trial Court\u2019s predecessor, the 46th Circuit Court, was the circuit court serving Otsego, Crawford, and Kalkaska counties. Pursuant to Administrative Order No. 1996-9, 451 Mich civ, the 46th Circuit Court, along with the district and probate courts within these counties,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> became part of a demonstration project designed to evaluate the feasibility of consolidating various court functions into a single entity known as the 46th Circuit Trial Court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The chief judge of the 46th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>Circuit Court was appointed the Trial Court\u2019s chief judge (hereafter Chief Judge), and Otsego County was designated as the Trial Court\u2019s control unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">In order to facilitate this consolidation, the Trial Court began a large-scale administrative reorganization for the purpose of standardizing wages, benefits, and personnel policies. During this reorganization in the summer of 2000, the Chief Judge requested that his employees switch to a less-favorable prescription drug and health insurance plan and that they relinquish longevity pay. In return for this concession, the Chief Judge agreed to seek an enhanced employee pension plan and a new retiree health care plan funded by the counties. The Chief Judge presented his enhanced benefits plan, first, to the Tri-County Committee, a nonbinding committee that consisted of individuals representing each county, and subsequently to each county\u2019s board of commissioners. The boards of commissioners for Otsego and Kalkaska counties passed resolutions agreeing to implement the enhanced benefits plan. On August 29, 2000, the Crawford County Board of Commissioners passed the following resolution:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-6\">MOTION by Hanson, seconded by Beardslee, to authorize the County [to] pay 24% of $50,000 ($12,000) for the year 2000 and that payment will increase at 4% per year until 2017, and at that time will pay an estimated $94,649 and that the Blue Cross/Blue Shield medical supplement payment per individual would be capped at [sic] the year 2000 at $4,087.00 [and] would increase at 4% per year until 2017 for an employee to be eligible for $7,654.00 per year.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-7\">MOTION by Wieland, seconded by Hanson, to request the [Trial] Court not implement the MERS [Municipal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>Employees\u2019 Retirement System] B-4 upgrade at this time, but recognize the change in the 2001/2002 budget cycle.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">That same afternoon, the Chief Judge informed the Chairwoman of the Crawford board that there had been an error in calculating the annual premium for the first year of the retiree health care plan and that the $4,087 figure was too low. The Chief Judge and the Chairwoman of the board subsequently agreed that the sum of $5,763 should be substituted as the correct first-year premium. However, the Crawford board never amended the resolution to reflect this new figure.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">Following the vote in Crawford County, the Chief Judge prepared a contract memorializing the agreement. Although the contract was signed by representatives from Kalkaska and Otsego counties, Crawford County refused to sign the contract because of the board\u2019s concern regarding the prospect of a sizeable unfunded liability.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Shortly thereafter, on December 4, 2000, the Chief Judge implemented both the enhanced benefits plan and the employee concessions by order. Initially, Crawford County alone refused to appropriate its share of the costs of the enhanced benefits plan for fiscal years 2001-2003. However, approximately one year after the implementation order was entered, the Kalkaska County Board of Commissioners rescinded its resolution approving the enhanced benefits plan primarily on the basis of the concerns raised by Crawford County.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Otsego County proceeded to fund the entire cost of the enhanced benefits plan without reimbursement from the other funding units.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>After unsuccessful attempts to settle the dispute, the Chief Judge communicated the notice required by Administrative Order No. 1998-5, \u00a7 III(l), 459 Mich clxxvi, of the Trial Court\u2019s intention to sue Crawford County. After the required 30-day waiting period expired, the Trial Court brought this action to compel funding, claiming both that Crawford County was contractually obligated to fund the enhanced benefits and that it had failed to provide sufficient funds to allow the court to operate. Specifically, the Trial Court argued that, absent the enhanced benefits, the morale of its employees would decline, leading to lower productivity and, as a result, the court would be unable to function. The Trial Court further argued that it could not generate sufficient savings in its budget to pay for the enhanced benefits and that any staff cuts would prevent the court from operating at a serviceable level. Crawford County denied the allegations and asserted in a counterclaim that the Trial Court had exceeded its authority when it implemented the enhanced pension and retiree health care plans and that the Trial Court had fraudulently misrepresented the costs of the latter. Kalkaska County moved to intervene on behalf of Crawford County. In a separate action, Crawford and Kalkaska counties sued Otsego County, claiming that Otsego County had improperly implemented the enhanced pension and retiree health care plans and had colluded with the Trial Court to withhold information about the cost of the pension increase. The cases were consolidated and the State Court Administrator assigned a circuit judge from outside the affected counties to preside over these cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">The circuit judge eventually found that the Trial Court\u2019s requested budget, specifically the requested appropriation for the enhanced benefits plan, was \u201creasonable and necessary\u201d to the court\u2019s ability to perform its essential functions. The requested appropriation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>was \u201creasonable\u201d because it was not \u201cexcessive\u201d and was \u201ccomparable to what other courts spend on like activities.\u201d The requested appropriation was also \u201cnecessary\u201d because it had been \u201cconvincingly\u201d proved that loss of the benefits plan would destroy employee morale to the point where the court could no longer function. The circuit judge also found that the August 29, 2000, resolution created an explicit contract with the Trial Court to implement the enhanced benefits plan. In a published opinion, 266 Mich App 150; 702 NW2d 588 (2005), the Court of Appeals affirmed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">This Court granted the defendant counties\u2019 application for leave to appeal, limited to the questions: (1) whether the appropriations sought for the enhanced benefits plan were \u201creasonable and necessary to achieve the court\u2019s constitutional and statutory responsibilities\u201d; (2) whether the defendant counties were contractually obligated to fund the enhanced benefits plan at the level requested by the Trial Court; and (3) whether there was evidence to support the conclusion that the level of funding offered by the counties was insufficient to allow the court to fulfill its essential functions. 474 Mich 986 (2005).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b194-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>II.

The interpretation of a county resolution, as with the interpretation of a statute, is a question of law, which we review de novo. <em>Eggleston v Bio-Medical Applications of Detroit, Inc, </em>468 Mich 29, 32; 658 NW2d 139 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"AlR\">A. \"INHERENT POWER\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">The judiciary\u2019s \u201cinherent power\u201d to compel funding is an extraordinary power and is derived from the separation of governmental powers set forth principally in Const 1963, arts 4-6, relating to the authorities of the legislative, executive, and judicial branches of government, Eind Const 1963, art 3, \u00a7 2, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>The powers of government are divided into three branches: legislative, executive and judicial. No person exercising powers of one branch shall exercise powers properly belonging to another branch except as expressly provided in this constitution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b195-4\">The framers of Michigan\u2019s Constitution understood well the importance of separating the powers of government. The doctrine of separation of powers rests on the notion that the accumulation of too much power in one governmental entity presents a threat to liberty. James Madison expressed this sentiment more than 200 years ago when he wrote, \u201cthe accumulation of all powers, legislative, executive, and judiciary, in the same hands, whether of one, a few, or many, and whether hereditary, self-appointed, or elective, may justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny.\u201d The Federalist, No. 47. Thus, governmental power was separated\u2014 with the Legislature exercising the \u201clegislative power,\u201d Const 1963, art 4, \u00a7 1; the Governor exercising the \u201cexecutive power,\u201d Const 1963, art 5, \u00a7 1; and the judiciary exercising the \u201cjudicial power,\u201d Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">The \u201clegislative power\u201d has been defined as the power \u201cto regulate public concerns, and to make law for the benefit and welfare of the state.\u201d Cooley, Treatise on the Constitutional Limitations (Little, Brown &amp; Co, 1886), at 92. Perhaps the most fundamental aspect of the \u201clegislative power,\u201d authorized by the opening sentence of US Const, art I, \u00a7 8, which defines the powers of the legislative branch, is the power to tax and to appropriate for specified purposes. See also Const 1963, art 4. The power to tax defines the extent to which economic resources will be apportioned between the people and their government, while the power to appropriate defines the priorities of government. Partly in recognition of the enormity of these powers, the framers of our constitutions determined that the branch of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>government to exercise these powers should be that branch which is closest to, and most representative of, the people.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">This is true for other reasons as well. In contrast with the judiciary, for example, the legislature is not restricted in the range of testimony that it may hear as a prelude to enacting public policy, it is better positioned to accommodate competing policy priorities, it is better equipped to effect compromise positions after negotiation and bargaining, it is more regularly and directly accountable to the people, and its membership is more broadly representative of society and its various interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">However, just as it is implicit in the separation of powers that each branch of government is empowered to carry out the entirety of its constitutional powers, and only these powers, it is also implicit that each branch must be allowed adequate resources to carry out its powers. Although the allocation of resources through the appropriations and taxing authorities lies at the heart of the <em>legislative </em>power, and thus belongs to the legislative branch, in those rare instances in which the legislature\u2019s allocation of resources impacts the ability of the judicial branch to carry out its constitutional responsibilities, what is otherwise exclusively a part of the legislative power becomes, to that extent, a part of the judicial power. As observed by James Madison:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-7\">[M] embers of each department should be as little dependent as possible on those of the others, for the emoluments annexed to their offices. Were the executive magistrate, or the judges, not independent of the Legislature in this particular, their independence in every other would be merely nominal. [Madison, The Federalist, No. 51.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-8\">As the legislative department alone has access to the pockets of the people, and has in some constitutions full discretion, and in all a prevailing influence over the pecu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>niary rewards of those who will fill the other departments, a dependence is thus created in the latter, which gives still greater facility to encroachments of the former. [Madison, The Federalist, No. 48.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">In order for the judicial branch to carry out its constitutional responsibilities as envisioned by Const 1963, art 3, \u00a7 2, the judiciary cannot be totally beholden to legislative determinations regarding its budgets. While the people of this state have the right to appropriations and taxing decisions being made by their elected representatives in the legislative branch, they also have the right to a judiciary that is funded sufficiently to carry out its constitutional responsibilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">Thus, the judiciary\u2019s \u201cinherent power\u201d to compel appropriations sufficient to enable it to carry out its constitutional responsibilities is a function of the separation of powers provided for in the Michigan Constitution. The \u201cinherent power\u201d does not constitute an exception to the separation of powers; rather, it is integral to the separation of powers itself. What <em>is </em>exceptional about the judiciary\u2019s \u201cinherent power\u201d is its distinctiveness from more traditional exercises of the judicial power, involving as it does determinations that directly implicate the appropriations power.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">However, in order to accommodate this distinctive, and extraordinary, judicial power with the normal primacy of the legislative branch in determining levels of appropriations, the \u201cinherent power\u201d has always been sharply circumscribed. The \u201cinherent power\u201d contemplates only the power, when an impasse has arisen between the legislative and judicial branches, to determine levels of appropriation that are \u201creasonable and necessary\u201d to enable the judiciary to carry out its constitutional responsibilities. However, levels of appro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>priation that are <em>optimally </em>required for the judiciary remain always determinations within the legislative power.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">This Court has recognized the inherent powers doctrine for over 120 years. In <em>Stowell v Jackson Co Bd of Supervisors, </em>57 Mich 31; 23 NW 557 (1885), the Jackson Circuit Court deemed it necessary to house jurors in a hotel during the course of a murder trial. After the trial was over, however, the board of supervisors refused to pay for the hotel charges. This Court undertook its analysis by noting that the trial court has the power and discretion to determine whether a jury needs to be secluded. We reasoned that, because the trial court has the power to sequester the jury, it must also have the authority to bind the county funding unit to pay for that sequestration. <em>Id. </em>To hold otherwise \u201cwould put it in the power of a board of supervisors to prevent courts from exercising their proper functions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 34-35.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Therefore, the Court concluded that, while the Legislature controls the power of the purse, \u201cthe inherent power and duty of courts to exercise their functions must authorize [payment for actions such as the sequestration] as becomes expedient in the course of judicial business.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">That the judiciary\u2019s inherent power to compel funding also extends to the appropriation of funds for employee salaries was expressed by Justice BLACK in his dissenting opinion in <em>Wayne Circuit Judges v Wayne Co, </em>383 Mich 10; 172 NW2d 436 (1969) <em>(Wayne Co I). As </em>he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>explained, the essence of the \u201cinherent power\u201d doctrine is \u201cthat the constitutionally-assigned duty of a court such as ours automatically carries with it the power and responsibility of making [continually] sure that this \u2018one court of justice\u2019 (Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 1) functions serviceably as a co-equal branch of Michigan\u2019s government . ...\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 33. To determine whether a court can function \u201cserviceably,\u201d Justice BLACK indicated that the Court must first determine whether the appropriation sought by the court is necessary to address a \u201ccritical judicial need[]\u201d and, if it is, then determine whether the amount requested is reasonable \u201cto meet the urgency of the situation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-3\">Less than two years later, this Court expressly adopted Justice Black\u2019s dissenting statement in <em>Wayne Co I. Wayne Circuit Judges v Wayne Co (On Rehearing), </em>386 Mich 1, 8-9; 190 NW2d 228 (1971) <em>(Wayne Co II). </em>In so holding, this Court concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-4\">\u201cthe Judiciary <em>must possess </em>the inherent power to determine and compel payment of those sums of money which are reasonable and necessary to carry out its mandated responsibilities, and its powers and duties to administer Justice, if it is to be in reality a co-equal, independent Branch of our Government.\u201d <em>[Id. </em>at 9, quoting <em>Commonwealth, ex rel Carroll v Tate, </em>442 Pa 45, 52; 274 A2d 193 (1971) (emphasis in original).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">We further reasoned that the \u201cinherent powers\u201d doctrine is rooted in the constitutional command that the judicial power of this state is vested exclusively in \u201cone court of justice. . . .\u201d Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 1. \u201cThe [Legislature may not abolish that court. Neither is it permissible for the [Legislature to render the court inoperative by refusing financial support.\u201d <em>Wayne Co II, supra </em>at 14 (opinion by T.E. BRENNAN, J.). Thus, the judiciary has the inherent power to seek the funding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>necessary to sustain its ability to function serviceably in carrying out its constitutional responsibilities. <em>Wayne Co I, supra </em>(BLACK, J., dissenting). On that basis, this Court held that Wayne County must appropriate funds for those positions \u201cestablished by the law or needed in the operation of the circuit court....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">Subsequent decisions make clear that the judiciary\u2019s inherent power to compel funding is limited to those appropriations required to meet \u201ccritical judicial needs.\u201d <em>Wayne Co Prosecutor v Wayne Co Bd of Comm\u2019rs, </em>93 Mich App 114; 286 NW2d 62 (1979). In <em>Wayne Co Prosecutor, </em>several county executive officers sought an injunction against budget cuts proposed by the defendant county. The Court of Appeals began its analysis by noting that, as is the case with the judiciary, a funding authority is obligated to budget sums sufficient to allow executive officers to carry out their mandated duties and obligations. However, the Court of Appeals also recognized that the courts must not involve themselves with the \u201ctruly discretionary appropriations decisions of a county board ....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 122. To balance these concerns, the Court of Appeals held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-5\">\u201cserviceability\u201d [is] tbe standard to be applied in determining whether the board of commissioners has unlawfully underfunded the county executive officers so that they are unable to fulfill their statutory obligations. Serviceability must be defined in the context of Justice Black\u2019s opinion, <em>i.e. </em>\u201curgent\u201d, \u201cextreme\u201d, \u201ccritical\u201d, and \u201cvital\u201d needs. A serviceable level of funding is the minimum budgetary appropriation at which statutorily mandated functions can be fulfilled. A serviceable level is not met when the failure to fund eliminates the function or creates an emergency immediately threatening the existence of the function. A serviceable level is not the optimal level. A function funded at a serviceable level will be carried out in a barely adequate manner, but it will be carried out. A function <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>funded below a serviceable level, however, will not be fulfilled as required by statute. <em>[Id. </em>at 124, citing <em>Wayne Co I </em>(Black, J., dissenting).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">This Court reiterated the limited nature of the \u201cinherent power\u201d doctrine in <em>Employees &amp; Judge of the Second Judicial Dist Court v Hillsdale Co, </em>423 Mich 705, 717; 378 NW2d 744 (1985). In <em>Hillsdale Co, </em>this Court addressed the issue of whether a funding unit could be compelled to appropriate funds for salary increases that were neither approved by it nor \u201cproven to be necessary to maintain a statutory function of the court or to provide for the overall administration of justice.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This Court began its analysis by noting that \u201c[e]ach branch of government has inherent power to preserve its constitutional authority.\u201d <em>Id. </em>On the other hand, \u201can indispensable ingredient of the concept of coequal branches of government is that \u2018each branch must recognize and respect the limits on its own authority and the boundaries of the authority delegated to the other branches.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>United States v Will, </em>449 US 200, 228; 101 S Ct 471; 66 L Ed 2d 392 (1980). Thus, a lawsuit to compel funding under the \u201cinherent powers\u201d doctrine is limited to circumstances where \u201cthe overall operation of the court, or a constitutional function is in jeopardy because of the actions taken by the funding unit.\u201d <em>Hillsdale Co, supra </em>at 717-719. This Court noted that there was no dispute that, as found by the trial court, the plaintiff trial court was functioning at a level \u201c \u2018satisfactory to all.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 722. Because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>there was no claim that the plaintiff trial court could not exercise a statutory or constitutional function, there was no basis to resolve \u201cthe issue of when and under what standards the judiciary may compel expenditures beyond those <em>appropriated____\u201d Id. </em>at 722.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">Justice RlLEY wrote separately for the purpose of \u201cset[ting] forth principled procedures to resolve, as fairly and expeditiously as possible, those conflicts which necessarily arise when the legislative branch refuses to approve funding requested by the judicial branch for reasonable and necessary court operations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 728 (RlLEY, J., dissenting). Specifically, Justice RlLEY responded to the majority\u2019s failure to articulate a standard against which the court\u2019s inherent power to compel funding is to be measured. Justice RlLEY began her analysis by recognizing that the \u201cinherent powers\u201d doctrine was designed to preserve the balance of power between the three branches, not to upset that balance in favor of judicial supremacy. In order to protect both the county board\u2019s power over county funds and the court\u2019s ability to exercise the judicial power, Justice RlLEY concluded that \u201cthe judiciary must bear the burden of articulating the constitutional bases for asserting [the inherent power]\u201d and that it must invoke the authority \u201cwith caution, in a manner that will not place in jeopardy the public\u2019s confidence in the integrity of the judiciary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 740. Specifically, Justice RlLEY opined that the court seeking to compel funding must \u201cset forth specific findings of fact, identifying those judicial functions that will be in jeopardy if the appropriation requested is denied, and conclusions of law indicating why the function is required by the constitution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 744.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">We agree with Justice RlLEY that invocation of the \u201cinherent power\u201d of the judiciary will least disrupt the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>constitutional balance between the judicial and legislative branches where procedures of the sort she proposes are followed. Accordingly, we adopt that portion of Justice RlLEY\u2019s opinion that articulates the <em>procedure </em>that trial courts must follow in pursuit of their \u201cinherent power.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">In litigation to compel funding, the plaintiff court must prove by clear and convincing evidence that the requested funding is both \u201creasonable and necessary.\u201d <em>Branch Co Bd of Comm\u2019rs v Service Employees Int\u2019l Union, </em>168 Mich App 340, 351; 423 NW2d 658 (1988); <em>17th Dist Prohate Court v Gladwin Co Bd of Comm\u2019rs, </em>155 Mich App 433, 453; 401 NW2d 50 (1986). The plaintiff court seeking to compel funding must demonstrate that \u201cthe overall operation of the court, or a constitutional function is in jeopardy because of the actions taken by the funding unit.\u201d <em>Hillsdale Co, supra </em>at 717-719. Finally, a court deciding an inherent powers claim must specifically set forth findings of fact identifying specifically those judicial functions that will be in jeopardy if the appropriation sought is denied, and conclusions of law indicating why such functions implicate the constitutional responsibilities of the judiciary.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">B. CLEAR &amp; CONVINCING EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">Because the Trial Court here has failed to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that the enhanced benefits plan is both \u201creasonable and necessary\u201d to allow that court to function serviceably in carrying out its constitutional responsibilities, we conclude that the circuit judge and the Court of Appeals clearly erred in holding that the Trial Court could compel appropriations for such plan. An appropriation is \u201cnecessary\u201d when it is sought by the court to address a \u201ccritical judicial needQ\u201d that affects that court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>ability to function \u201cserviceably\u201d in carrying out its constitutional responsibilities. <em>Wayne Co </em>I, <em>supra </em>at 33-34. A \u201cserviceable\u201d level of funding is \u201cthe minimum budgetary appropriation at which statutorily mandated functions can be fulfilled.\u201d <em>Wayne Co Prosecutor, supra </em>at 124. \u201cA function funded at a serviceable level will be carried out in a barely adequate manner, but it will be carried out.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">To justify the conclusion that the enhanced benefits plan was both \u201creasonable and necessary,\u201d the circuit judge and the Court of Appeals both relied on the claims of the Chief Judge that failure to provide the enhanced benefits would negatively affect employee morale. However, we believe that the Trial Court failed to demonstrate that there existed a morale problem that impaired the court\u2019s ability to function \u201cserviceably\u201d in carrying out its constitutional responsibilities. <em>Wayne Co II.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">Specifically, the Chief Judge testified that there \u201cprobably\u201d would be people who would quit their jobs and that the Trial Court would have trouble finding new employees. However, the Chief Judge\u2019s opinion was utterly unsupported. The Trial Court failed to demonstrate that even <em>one person </em>had either left its employ or was planning to leave its employ as a result of the alleged inadequacy of the preexisting benefits plan.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Further, the Trial Court was unable to identify even <em>one </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number><em>person </em>who had refused an offer of employment because the preexisting benefits plan was inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">Even assuming for the sake of argument that there was sufficient evidence to support the Chief Judge\u2019s claim of declining morale, a claimed effect on employee morale, by itself, is not sufficient to invoke the \u201cinherent powers\u201d doctrine. The circuit judge and the Court of Appeals based their holdings on <em>Gladwin Co. </em>In <em>Glad-win Co, </em>the defendant funding unit determined compensation for court employees without taking into account the training, responsibilities, and duties of each position. As a result, for example, a probation officer was paid the same amount as a register, and a newly hired juvenile probation officer was paid the same wage as the defendant county\u2019s general clerical employees. The Court of Appeals concluded that, because of the morale problems caused by this \u201cunfair and inequitable\u201d pay scheme, the additional appropriations for salaries for the disputed positions were \u201creasonable and necessary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 454-455.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">However, we note that declining employee morale alone was <em>not </em>the determinative factor in <em>Gladwin Co. </em>As noted by the Court of Appeals, the irrational pay scheme instituted by the funding unit had caused the court to fill the position of juvenile probation officer six times in less than 12 years. Further, the court had considerable difficulty attracting competent employees for the position, as demonstrated by the two occasions on which the position had gone unfilled for more than three months each. In other words, the irrational pay scheme had not just caused the court\u2019s employees to become \u201cdemoralized,\u201d but such morale problems had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>specifically manifested themselves in the court\u2019s inability to hire and retain probation officers. Accordingly, we conclude that a claim that court employees suffer from a loss of morale is insufficient to support an inherent powers claim, absent some showing that the claimed morale problems have demonstrably caused court employees to be unable to carry out their constitutional responsibilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">Further, there is no evidence here that the productivity of court employees has diminished to such an extent that the court cannot carry out its constitutional responsibilities, or indeed that it has diminished to any extent. Rudi Edel, administrator of the Trial Court, testified that the court was not suffering from any speedy-trial problems either before or after the current funding controversy. Defendants\u2019 appendix at 1452a-1453a.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In fact, the court has continued to process its civil and criminal dockets adequately.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>Moreover, an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>audit conducted by the State Court Administrative Office determined that the Trial Court\u2019s quality control is \u201cexcellent.\u201d Thus, unlike in <em>Gladwin Co, </em>there is no evidence that the claimed morale problems rendered the court incapable of carrying out any of its essential judicial functions. Even if we accept the Chief Judge\u2019s unsupported statements that some court employees may have \u201cone eye on another job\u201d and will be \u201cunhappy,\u201d the Trial Court has failed to demonstrate that those employees are unable to perform their jobs. In fact, the Trial Court\u2019s own expert testified that the employees were functioning \u201cwithin the ranges that are expected to be there by the State.\u201d Plaintiffs appendix at 852b.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Further, the Chief Judge admitted that his staff was \u201csoldiering on\u201d even in light of the potential loss of the enhanced benefits plan. In other words, even assuming that the employees were dissatisfied or unhappy, the Trial Court was, in fact, <em>able </em>to function as a court even without the enhanced benefits plan. The question in an inherent powers case is not whether all court employees are \u201csatisfied\u201d or \u201chappy,\u201d but, rather, whether they are able to perform their jobs in a manner that allows the Trial Court to function \u201cserviceably\u201d in carrying out its constitutional responsibilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>Also, the Chief Judge admitted at trial that he specifically asked for \u201cthe best [pension] plan that\u2019s available.\u201d Trial transcript at 342. In other words, the requested appropriation, by its own terms, comprises the <em>maximum </em>necessary to improve employee morale, not what was \u201creasonable and necessary\u201d to ensure that its employees could carry out the Trial Court\u2019s constitutional responsibilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">Finally, any claimed morale problems that did exist among the Trial Court\u2019s employees seem predicated upon the Chief Judge\u2019s own unilateral promise to provide the enhanced benefits.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> To this extent, the Trial Court is seeking to require the counties to pay for a problem that it has arguably created. It cannot be that a court can claim a \u201cmorale problem\u201d where the alleged problem is a function of unwarranted promises of benefit increases that it has made to its employees. Under the circuit judge\u2019s reasoning in this regard, any court could seek to invoke its \u201cinherent power\u201d to compel its funding unit to make an appropriation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>beyond what it was prepared to make\u2014 no matter how unreasonable or unnecessary\u2014 solely on the basis of such a unilateral promise. To adopt such a position would not maintain the balance of powers between the legislative and judicial branches\u2014 as the \u201cinherent powers\u201d doctrine is designed to do\u2014 but would instead impose a doctrine of judicial supremacy in favor of the branch of government <em>least </em>suited to make policy-driven appropriations and taxing decisions.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">In light of insufficient evidence that the appropriation for enhanced benefits sought by the Trial Court was \u201cnecessary\u201d to the ability of the court to function \u201cserviceably\u201d in carrying out its constitutional responsibilities, the Trial Court has failed to establish a right to compel funding from the defendants under the \u201cinherent powers\u201d doctrine.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Therefore, any increased benefits for the employees of the Trial Court must come through the ordinary processes of negotiation and bargaining between the Trial Court and the representatives of the people on the Crawford, Kalkaska, and Otsego county boards of commissioners; such benefits are not properly obtained by judicial order.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">C. CONTRACT CLAIMS</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">Although we conclude that the requested appropriation was not \u201cnecessary\u201d to allow the Trial Court to function \u201cserviceably\u201d in carrying out its constitutional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>responsibilities, we must also address the lower courts\u2019 alternative conclusion that defendants are contractually obligated to appropriate funding for the enhanced benefits plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">Administrative Order No. 1998-5, 459 Mich clxxviclxxvii, provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-6\">A court must submit its proposed and appropriated annual budget and subsequent modifications to the State Court Administrator at the time of submission to or receipt from the local funding unit or units. The budget submitted must be in conformity with a uniform chart of accounts. If the local funding unit requests that a proposed budget be submitted in line-item detail, the chief judge must comply with the request.... A chief judge may not enter into a multiple-year commitment concerning any personnel economic issue unless: (1) the funding unit agrees, or (2) the agreement does not exceed the percentage increase or the duration of a multiple-year contract that the funding unit has negotiated for its employees....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-7\">If, after the local funding unit has made its appropriations, a court concludes that the funds provided for its operations by its local funding unit are insufficient to enable the court to properly perform its duties and that legal action is necessary, the procedures set forth in this order must be followed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">Our primary task in construing a statute is to discern and give effect to the intent of the Legislature. <em>Sun Valley Foods Co v Ward, </em>460 Mich 230, 236; 596 NW2d 119 (1999). \u201cThe words of a statute provide \u2018the most reliable evidence of its intent....\u2019\u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>United States v Turkette, </em>452 US 576, 593; 101 S Ct 2524; 69 L Ed 2d 246 (1981). This Court must consider \u201cboth the plain meaning of the critical word or phrase as well as \u2018its placement and purpose in the statutory scheme.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sun Valley, supra </em>at 237, quoting <em>Bailey v United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number><em>States, </em>516 US 137, 145; 116 S Ct 501; 133 L Ed 2d 472 (1995). \u201cThe statutory language must be read and understood in its grammatical context, unless it is clear that something different was intended.\u201d <em>Sun Valley, supra </em>at 237. \u201cIf the language of the statute is unambiguous, the Legislature must have intended the meaning clearly expressed, and the statute must be enforced as written.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 236. \u201c[T]he same principles of statutory construction apply in determining [this Court\u2019s] intent in promulgating rules of procedure ....\u201d <em>People v Davis, </em>181 Mich App 354, 356; 448 NW2d 842 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">As noted above, the Constitution imposes a duty on a county board of commissioners to appropriate funds \u201creasonable and necessary\u201d to allow the court to function serviceably in carrying out its constitutional responsibilities. Once the board of commissioners has made a funding determination, AO 1998-5 imposes a duty on the court not to exceed either the total amount appropriated by the board or the amount specified in a line-item appropriation. Where the total or line-item appropriation is insufficient, the court must follow the procedures set forth in AO 1998-5. A trial court may only challenge a funding decision made by a county board if \u201cthe funds provided for its operations ... are insufficient to enable the court to properly perform its duties . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, the county board\u2019s appropriations to the judiciary can be challenged either through the political process, i.e., by seeking an additional appropriation from the board, or through the legal process, when the board has failed to appropriate enough money to allow the court to function serviceably in carrying out its constitutional responsibilities. However, if it decides not to exercise either of these two options, a trial court must live within the budget appropriated by its board.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>The circuit judge and the Court of Appeals majority concluded that a county board could also be bound by contract to appropriate a certain level of funding to its trial courts. However, the county board has a preexisting constitutional duty to appropriate a serviceable level of funding to its trial courts. An essential element in a contract claim is legal consideration. <em>Yerkovich v AAA, </em>461 Mich 732, 740; 610 NW2d 542 (2000). \u201cUnder the preexisting duty rule, it is well settled that doing what one is legally bound to do is not consideration for a new promise.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 740-741. Such a contract would appear to fail for lack of consideration. <em>Puett v Walker, </em>332 Mich 117, 122; 50 NW2d 740 (1952). In other words, because the county board has a preexisting duty to appropriate a serviceable level of funding to its court, a county cannot be compelled under contract law to appropriate \u201creasonable and necessary\u201d funds to enable the court to function serviceably in carrying out its constitutional responsibilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">Moreover, there was no \u201cmeeting of the minds\u201d between the Trial Court and Crawford County because the terms of the retiree health care plan were altered after the Crawford County resolution was passed. <em>West Bloomfield Hosp v Certificate of Need Bd (On Remand), </em>223 Mich App 507, 519; 567 NW2d 1 (1997). Here, the resolution passed by Crawford County authorized a $4,087 cap on payments made in the first year of the benefit program. However, the actual first year cap was $5,763. The board never amended the resolution to reflect that new figure, and never voted on any amended resolution. The circuit judge and the Court of Appeals majority held that the resolution constituted a valid acceptance of the Trial Court\u2019s offer because \u201c[t]he annual payment cap was not an essential term.\u201d 266 Mich App at 160. We disagree. One of the principal concerns raised by Crawford County was that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>retiree health care plan would create \u201cmassive liabilities [for Crawford County] in the future.\u201d Defendants\u2019 appendix at 330a. A higher first-year premium would exacerbate these concerns, because the health care plan would potentially have to pay an extra $1,676 for each person covered by the plan in the first year. Obviously, if the fund is required to pay a higher annual premium, the amount of money set aside for the benefit would be depleted faster than anticipated when the board passed its resolution. We conclude that the unambiguous language of the resolution is consistent with the understanding that Crawford County was willing to agree to the plan only if the starting health insurance cost was $4,087 for each employee. Because this figure was not the eventual starting cost of the health insurance, there was simply no meeting of the minds and therefore no contract. Further, no one disputes that the enhanced benefits plan could not have been implemented without the consent of all three funding units. Because the purported contract fails with respect to Crawford County inasmuch as there was no meeting of the minds, any contract between the Trial Court and the other funding units for the enhanced benefits plan must also fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\">In summary, a county board\u2019s duty to appropriate funds to the judiciary arises from the Constitution. Because a county has a preexisting duty to fund its trial courts, a county cannot enter into a contract with the Trial Court to fund the enhanced benefits plan at a specific level. Moreover, the purported contract fails with respect to Crawford County because there was no meeting of the minds. Because all three funding units had to agree to implement the enhanced benefits plan, any contract between the Trial Court and the other funding units for the enhanced benefits plan must also fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>IV CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">We conclude that the Michigan Constitution only permits the judicial branch to directly compel the legislative branch to appropriate when a court has not received sufficient funding to operate at a serviceable level. <em>Hillsdale Co, supra </em>at 722. A court deciding an \u201cinherent power\u201d claim must set forth findings of fact identifying specifically those judicial functions that will be in jeopardy if the appropriation requested is denied, and conclusions of law indicating why such functions implicate the constitutional responsibilities of the judiciary. We hold that the Trial Court here has failed to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that the requested appropriation for enhanced benefits was \u201creasonable and necessary\u201d to the \u201cserviceability\u201d of the court. The Trial Court has failed to produce any evidence that even one employee was planning to leave if the enhanced benefits were not adopted or that anyone has refused to accept employment with the court because of the preexisting benefits plan. Moreover, the evidence demonstrates that the Trial Court has continued to carry out its essential judicial functions adequately. While the Trial Court may or may not have been functioning \u201chappily\u201d or \u201coptimally,\u201d it is nonetheless reasonably functioning, which is all that is required to preclude the exercise of the judiciary\u2019s \u201cinherent power.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">We also conclude that because a county has a preexisting constitutional duty to fund its courts, the defendant counties could not enter into a contract with the Trial Court to fund the enhanced benefits plan at a specific level. Moreover, the purported contract fails with respect to Crawford County because there was no meeting of the minds. Since all three funding units had to agree to implement the enhanced benefits plan, any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>contract between the Trial Court and the other funding units for the enhanced benefits plan must also fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand this matter to the circuit judge for entry of judgment in favor of the defendant counties. Increased public employee benefits in defendant counties must be enacted through the democratic processes of government\u2014 through the decision-making of the legislative branch\u2014 not by judicial order.</p>\n<judges id=\"b215-5\">Taylor, C.

I concur in the result and virtually all of the reasoning of Justice MARKMAN\u2019s lead opinion.

Further, I agree with the lead opinion that on the facts of this case, the enhanced retirement benefits sought by plaintiff do not fall within the judiciary\u2019s inherent authority to compel funding. I do not, however, join the portion of the lead opinion that adopts the reasoning set forth in <em>Wayne Co Prosecutor v Wayne Co Bd of Comm\u2019rs, </em>93 Mich App 114; 286 NW2d 62 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">In general, this Court does not reach constitutional issues that are not necessary to resolve a case. <em>People v Riley, </em>465 Mich 442, 447; 636 NW2d 514 (2001). In my view, the existing authorities <em>of this Court </em>fully support the conclusion in Justice MARKMAN\u2019s opinion that the enhanced retirement benefits at issue here are not reasonable and necessary to the serviceability of plaintiffs court. See, e.g., <em>Wayne Circuit Judges v Wayne Co (On Rehearing), </em>386 Mich 1; 190 NW2d 228 (1971) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number><em>('Wayne County II), </em>and other decisions of this Court discussed in the lead opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">Therefore, because plaintiffs inherent-powers claim must fail under this Court\u2019s own case law, I do not decide whether to adopt the analytic approach set forth by the Court of Appeals in <em>Wayne Co Prosecutor. </em>In particular, I do not find it necessary to adopt the assertions in <em>Wayne Co Prosecutor </em>that \u201c[a] serviceable level of funding is the <em>minimum </em>budgetary appropriation at which statutorily mandated functions can be fulfilled,\u201d and that \u201c[a] function funded at a serviceable level will be carried out in <em>a barely adequate manner, </em>but it will be carried out.\u201d <em>Wayne Co Prosecutor, supra </em>at 124.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">In my view, it is simply not necessary in this case to decide whether the judiciary\u2019s inherent authority to compel funding should be limited to \u201cminimum budgetary appropriation^]\u201d and to functions that are carried out \u201cin a barely adequate manner.\u201d Kather, I decide this case on the basis of the existing authorities of this Court, which fully support our decision in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">For these reasons, I express no view on whether this Court should adopt the analysis outlined in <em>Wayne Co Prosecutor. </em>In all other respects, I concur in the analysis and conclusions set forth in Justice MARKMAN\u2019s lead opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b216-7\">WEAVER, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ANu\">odissenting). I respectfully dissent from the result and reasoning of the lead opinion. I would hold that Judge Dennis C. Kolenda, the trial judge who conducted the six-day hearing in this case and reviewed the 300 exhibits totaling approximately 5,500 pages, did not clearly err in finding that the enhanced pension plan and the retiree health care plan were reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>and necessary to the 46th Circuit Trial Court\u2019s ability to perform its mandated responsibilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\">I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals in holding that Judge Kolenda did not clearly err in finding that the requested appropriation to fund the enhanced pension plan and the retiree health care plan was reasonable and necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">This funding dispute between the 46th Circuit Trial Court (Trial Court) and two of the three counties it serves arose out of the consolidation of certain courts in Kalkaska, Crawford, and Otsego counties, pursuant to Administrative Order No. 1996-9, 451 Mich civ.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">During the early stages of unification, the Trial Court concluded that all employees doing the same job, regardless of the county in which they physically worked, should earn equal pay and receive equal benefits. After negotiations with Chief Judge Alton Davis of the Trial Court, the employees agreed to phase out longevity pay and dedicate a portion of all future wage increases to fund the retiree benefits package. The court employees also agreed to accept a cost-saving health care insurance plan that offered less coverage and had a higher prescription copay. Chief Judge Davis then secured the agreement of the three counties, Crawford, Kalkaska, and Otsego, to fund an enhanced pension plan and a retiree health care plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-8\">After Judge Davis entered an order implementing those new plans, Crawford and Kalkaska counties reneged on their agreement and passed resolutions disapproving those plans. Thus, at the time that Judge Davis entered the implementation order that gave the employees their new benefits, he was acting according to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>the existing approval of the counties. After lengthy negotiations failed, this suit followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">As a coequal, independent branch of the government, the judiciary has the inherent power \u201c \u2018to determine and compel payment of those sums of money which are reasonable and necessary to carry out its mandated responsibilities, and its powers and duties to administer Justice....\u2019<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> When a court and funding unit cannot reach agreement, the court may initiate suit to compel expenditures in excess of appropriations.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">The question before us is whether the enhanced pension plan and the retiree health care plan are reasonable and necessary for the Trial Court to carry out its mandated responsibilities, and its powers and duties to administer justice.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">The lead opinion attempts to limit the judiciary\u2019s inherent power to compel funding by adopting the Court of Appeals reasoning in <em>Wayne Co Prosecutor v Wayne Co Bd of </em>Comm\u2019rs,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> that \u201c[a] serviceable level of funding is the <em>minimum </em>budgetary appropriation at which statutorily mandated functions can be fulfilled,\u201d and that \u201c[a] function funded at a serviceable level will be carried out in <em>a barely adequate manner, </em>but it will be carried out.\u201d But Justice CORRIGAN writes separately to say that \u201cit is simply not necessary in this case to decide whether [to adopt the <em>Wayne Co Prosecutor </em>standard].\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> An opinion of this Court that does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>obtain four signatures is not binding precedent.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Consequently, the lead opinion does not change the existing standards used to determine whether a court can use its inherent power to secure funding.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">This Court reviews the factual findings underlying the trial court\u2019s determination whether a requested appropriation was \u201creasonable and necessary\u201d for clear error.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u201cAn appellate court should not reverse the findings of a trial court in such a case unless its findings are clearly erroneous. \u2018A finding is \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d [if] although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The fact-finder has not clearly erred \u201csimply because [the appellate court is] convinced that it would have decided the case differently.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> If there are two permissible views of the evidence, the fact-finder\u2019s choice between them cannot be clearly erroneous.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Further, assessment of credibility lies within the trial court\u2019s province.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Under MCR 2.613(C), \u201cregard shall be given to the special opportunity of the trial court to judge the credibility of the witnesses who appeared before it.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>Although the lead opinion purports to review Judge Kolenda\u2019s factual findings for clear error, it in fact engages in a review de novo. The lead opinion does not give due deference to Judge Kolenda\u2019s ability to assess the credibility of the witnesses before him, and imposes its own inaccurate interpretation of the record to conclude that the enhanced pension plan and the retiree health care plan were not reasonable and necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">In his 53-page opinion, Judge Kolenda specifically found that the \u201cTrial Courts witnesses [were] credible and persuasive\u201d and the defendant\u2019s witnesses were \u201cignorant of many pertinent facts\u201d; Judge Kolenda also found that the defendant\u2019s witnesses\u2019 answers were \u201cshallow,\u201d \u201cevasive,\u201d and \u201cconclusive.\u201d Judge Kolenda stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-7\">This Court found the Trial Court\u2019s witnesses to be credible and persuasive. They gave testimony which reflected careful and thoughtful assessments of the pertinent facts. Crawford County\u2019s expert was a witness who rationalized a pre-ordained opinion. He was ignorant of many pertinent facts and his assessments were shallow. Furthermore, much of his testimony was evasive, betraying a realization that he could not sustain his conclusions. Crawford County\u2019s controller was not dishonest, but he could not articulate any persuasive bases for the conclusory positions he took. The several county commissioners who testified were not helpful. They testified only to what they have convinced themselves, or have been convinced, happened and was intended.<footnotemark>[13]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">Judge Kolenda\u2019s candid assessment of the credibility of the witnesses must provide guidance to this Court\u2019s review of his factual findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>c</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">Judge Kolenda first found that the enhanced pension plan and the retiree health care plan are <em>necessary. </em>As Justice RILEY stated in her dissent in <em>Hillsdale, supra, </em>\u201cto be reasonable and necessary the need must not only be practical rather than relative, but it must be shown that the funds are needed for the effective administration of justice.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Judge Kolenda\u2019s ultimate finding on the issue of necessity was that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-5\">[t]his Court is also convinced that funding the proposed retiree healthcare and upgraded pensions are indispensable to the Trial Court continuing to function at a serviceable level. Without those benefit enhancements, staff morale, which is already low, will plummet, with the result that <em>productivity will suffer badly, soon falling below serviceable levels. </em>In addition, good employees will leave, and competent replacements will not be found. Those prospects establish that the benefits which the Trial Court seeks to fund are indispensable to maintaining a workforce which is itself indispensable to the Trial Court fulfilling its obligations, making those benefits themselves indispensable. The prospect is enough. The Trial Court need not wait for its operations to actually fall below serviceable levels. <em>[Seventeenth Dist Probate Court </em>v] <em>Gladwin County [Bd of Comm\u2019rs, </em>155 Mich App 433, 449; 401 NW2d 50 (1986)]. [Emphasis added.]<footnotemark>[15]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">Judge Kolenda\u2019s ultimate finding that the enhanced pension plan and the retiree health care plan are necessary was based in part on Judge Kolenda\u2019s factual determination that employees were quitting work while waiting for the new benefit package:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-7\">Some employees have left out of dissatisfaction with the delay in finalizing the healthcare fund and pension up<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>grade, but many have stayed in anticipation of getting those benefits. However, if not awarded them, many employees are expected to leave. Moral [sic] will be affected even more; and the judges\u2019 ability to lead the Court will be destroyed. The ultimate effect would, obviously, be a serious loss of productivity!<footnotemark>[16]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">The lead opinion asserts that the proposed benefits are not necessary because the Trial Court has utterly failed to demonstrate the necessity:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-7\">[T]he Chief Judge testified that there \u201cprobably\u201d would be people who would quit their jobs and that the Trial Court would have trouble finding new employees. However, the Chief Judge\u2019s opinion was utterly unsupported. The Trial Court failed to demonstrate that even <em>one person </em>had either left its employ or was planning to leave its employ as a result of the alleged inadequacy of the preexisting benefits plan!<footnotemark>[17]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">This statement mischaracterizes the record. Rudi Edel, the trial court administrator and magistrate for the 46th Circuit Trial Court, testified that six employees left for wages and benefits:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-9\">[W]e had a turnover rate in the court... 36 employees, and by now I think it\u2019s around 46/47 employees. Some of those \u2014 three or four or five ... were discharged. Some of those employees left the court as a result of moving out of the area. Some of those employees left the court because they were dissatisfied with wages, benefits. And some of them even with court reform; they were not happy with a shift in their job duties... . Another component is that we wanted to attract employees to our court, and to do that we need to have a good benefit structure!<footnotemark>[18]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b222-10\">Rudi Edel later quantified the exact number of employees who recently quit because of poor wages and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>benefits. \u201cOut of the 36 people identified on this list, I can definitely identify that six left for wages and benefits.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">In <em>Gladwin </em>Co<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> the Court of Appeals held that enhanced pay for a position is \u201creasonable and necessary\u201d for a court to carry out its assigned functions where there was testimony that the court employees had protested the present rate of compensation in writing and orally, that the present rate of compensation had created a morale problem in the court, and the plaintiffs expert witness testified that the current compensation structure was not rational.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The lead opinion attempts to distinguish <em>Gladwin Co, </em>stating that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-5\">employee morale alone was not the determinative factor in <em>Gladwin Co. </em>As noted by the Court of Appeals, the irrational pay scheme instituted by the funding unit had caused the court to fill the position of juvenile probation officer six times in less than 12 years.<footnotemark>[22]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">This attempted distinction between the facts of <em>Glad-win Co </em>and the present case fails. In <em>Gladwin Co, </em>the plaintiff went through six juvenile probation officers in less than 12 years. Here, Judge Kolenda noted in his opinion that \u201c[s]ome employees have left out of dissatisfaction with the delay in finalizing the healthcare fund and pension upgrade,\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> and Rudi Edel testified that \u201csix [employees] left for wages and benefits.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">Benefit packages are necessary when at least six frustrated employees quit work because of poor wages <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>and benefits at a court already staffed at bare bones and just getting by. Here, as in <em>Gladwin Co, </em>something more than morale establishes that the additional funding is necessary. In both cases, six employees had quit their jobs.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">The lead opinion also attempts to refute Judge Kolenda\u2019s finding of necessity by stating that there is no evidence that the employees\u2019 productivity has diminished to any extent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-7\">[T]here is <em>no evidence </em>here that the productivity of court employees has diminished to such an extent that the court cannot carry out its constitutional responsibilities <em>or indeed that it has diminished to any extent. </em>Rudi Edel, administrator of the Trial Court, testified that the court was not suffering from any speedy-trial problems either before or after the current funding controversy. <footnotemark>[24]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">Again, the lead opinion\u2019s conclusion ignores evidence adduced at trial to support Judge Kolenda\u2019s factual findings. Judge Kolenda found that without the benefit enhancements, \u201cproductivity will suffer badly, soon falling below serviceable levels.\u201d This was supported by testimony that the Trial Court cannot comply with its statutory and court-ordered requirements at the current staffing level. Rudi Edel stated that the court was not complying with at least one administrative order of this Court, three or four federal statutes, and three or four state statutes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-9\">I found that with our current staffing levels we are complying with all the requirements with very few exceptions. And I would need to see the report to specifically outline those exceptions. I know one is administrative order 1991-4. There is [sic] three or four federal statutes that our Friend of the Court does not comply with; three or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>four state statues. And these are issues that we just don\u2019t have the manpower to get to.<footnotemark>[25]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-4\">Furthermore, the testimony of Rudi Edel establishes that the court workers are currently working \u201c110 percent.\u201d He testified that \u201c[i]f nobody goes on vacation and if nobody gets sick with our current staffing level, once we replace the assignment clerk, we\u2019ll get the job done.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">The lead opinion asserts that the enhanced benefits were not reasonable and necessary to address the Trial Court\u2019s failure to comply with its court-imposed and statutory requirements because the \u201crequested appropriation is for <em>retiree </em>benefits and would not result in a single additional person being hired.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Under the lead opinion\u2019s rationale, retiree benefits will never be \u201cnecessary.\u201d But retiree benefits are part of a comprehensive compensation package; contrary to the lead opinion\u2019s contention, people <em>do </em>choose jobs on the basis of adequacy or inadequacy of retiree benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">The lead opinion also quotes from the testimony of expert witness Ross Childs, the county executive of Grand Traverse County, to support its contention that the Trial Court was \u201cnot suffering from any speedy-trial problems ... .\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> The lead opinion states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-7\">In fact, the Trial Court\u2019s own expert testified that the employees were functioning \u201cwithin the ranges that are expected to be there by the State.\u201d<footnotemark>[29]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">But this quote takes Mr. Childs\u2019s testimony out of context. Ross Childs\u2019s statement was made in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>context of excess budgets.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Mr. Childs actually said that the Trial Court\u2019s <em>budget </em>is \u201cwithin the ranges that are expected to be there by the State.\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Mr. Childs\u2019s <em>full </em>statement was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-6\"><em>I looked at the </em>\u2014 the <em>budgets that were prepared. I read some of the documents. I </em>\u2014 I <em>looked at it and made an assessment as to whether there was what I thought \u201cfat\u201d in the budget. I didn\u2019t see a lot of fat in the budget. </em>I looked at the caseloads and I went through the State Court Administrator\u2019s Officer and looked at the reports that were there, the assignments and the staff and the caseload per staff for caseworkers in the Friend of the Court and probation officers and so on were consistent; that they are well in \u2014 within the ranges that are expected to be there by the State. <em>I didn\u2019t find the fat in the </em>budget.<footnotemark>[32]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">Mr. Childs\u2019s statement had nothing to do with the ability of the employees to perform their jobs. The statement was in the context of \u201cfat\u201d within the Trial Court\u2019s budget. The lead opinion\u2019s statement that the \u201cTrial Court\u2019s own expert testified that the employees were functioning \u2018within the ranges that are expected to be there by the State\u2019 \u201d is a mischaracterization.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">To summarize, evidence presented at trial demonstrates that the friend of the court cannot meet all of its duties mandated by court administrative order and state and federal statutes. Furthermore, the rest of the court\u2019s work can only be performed if the employees work at \u201c110 percent\u201d and no one goes on vacation or gets sick. As previously stated, clear error exists only when the appellate court \u2018 \u201cis left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>lead opinion has not provided a factual basis to justify its \u201cdefinite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made\u201d because there is evidence on the record to support Judge Kolenda\u2019s factual finding that the Trial Court cannot comply with its statutory requirements because of its shortage of manpower.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">Finally, the lead opinion asserts that the Trial Court <em>created </em>the morale problem:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-5\">[A]ny claimed morale problems that did exist among the Trial Court\u2019s employees seem predicated upon the Chief Judge\u2019s own unilateral promise to provide the enhanced benefits. To this extent, the Trial Court is seeking to require the counties to pay for a problem that it has arguably created.<footnotemark>[34]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">The lead opinion misstates the facts. Judge Davis did not make a unilateral promise to provide enhanced benefits, nor did he create the morale problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">Judge Kolenda specifically found that on December 4, 2000, Chief Judge Davis \u201cissued an implementation order which recited that \u2018[e]ach of the Funding Units has passed resolutions accepting the benefit shifts which are governed by this order.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> One week later, the Kalkaska board rescinded its approval of the retiree health care fund and the pension upgrade; then on February 1, 2001, the Crawford board also rescinded its acceptance of the health care fund for retirees.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">Thus, at the time that Judge Davis entered the implementation order that gave the employees their new benefits, he was acting according to the existing approval of the counties. The morale problem was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>created when the counties reconsidered their decision to adopt the retiree health care and pension benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">There was testimony offered to establish that Judge Davis did not make a unilateral promise of benefits. Linda Franklin, the probate register in Crawford County, explained how Judge Davis informed the employees of the proposed benefit package. She describes the process as a <em>\u201cproposed\u201d </em>exchange of \u201ccertain substantial benefits\u201d for \u201cbetter benefits.\u201d At no time did Linda Franklin state that the enhanced benefits were \u201cpromised\u201d to her or the other employees:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-7\">Judge Davis called a staff meeting for the court employees in all three counties, I believe in the summer of 2000. <em>At that meeting he explained to the employees what he was going to propose as far as standardizing and increasing the benefits for the three county court employees.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-8\">In return he requested that we give up certain substantial benefits that we had as a contribution to obtaining those better benefits for all of us.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-9\">He asked us to give up our longevity payments. He asked us to give up a certain percentage of our wage increases over a three-year period. And he asked us to accept a different health plan that would gave a higher co-pay for prescription drugs and doctor visits, I believe.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-10\">The Court\u2019s employees, I believe, were excited <em>and we wanted to do what we could to try to obtain these better benefits, </em>and so we all assented at that meeting that we would be willing to give up those substantial benefits if he were able to increase our benefits to these higher levels.<footnotemark>[37]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-11\">This evidence refutes the lead opinion\u2019s theory that Chief Judge Davis created the morale problem by making a unilateral promise to provide enhanced benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>D</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">Judge Kolenda found that the benefits are <em>reasonable </em>because they were modest, not excessive, the product of sound judgment, and available to other employees in the counties.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">First, Judge Kolenda found the retiree health care benefit was reasonable because it was \u201ccapped at a modest annual sum,\u201d stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-6\">The counties are not being asked to provide healthcare benefits to court employees. That could be expensive, although, given the need for healthcare coverage, what fair compensation might require, but the counties are being asked only to make modest, defined annual contributions to a fund from which the Court will buy whatever benefits can be acquired with the assets in that fund. The counties have no exposure beyond the annual contribution, which, even as it escalates, is capped at a modest annual sum.<footnotemark>[39]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">Second, Judge Kolenda found that the amount requested for the benefits package was \u201creasonable\u201d because the benefits were not excessive, and the product of sound judgment, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-8\">In sum, a proposed appropriation is reasonable, even though considerably more than what a funding unit is willing to provide, if it is not excessive, e.g., is comparable to what other courts spend on like activities; if it is within the funding unit\u2019s ability to pay; and if it reflects sound judgment, e.g., is the product of careful analysis and thought. The budget which the Trial Court proposes in these cases meets those tests. Therefore, that court is entitled to have that budget fully funded.<footnotemark>[40]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>Third, Judge Kolenda determined that the pension plan is reasonable because it is available to some other employees in Crawford and Kalkaska counties, as well as some employees in nearby counties.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">Finally, Judge Kolenda found that the enhanced pension was \u201cnot excessive\u201d even though it is the \u201ctop of the line\u201d pension available through the state pension system. The lead opinion disagrees with this finding, and contends that the benefits are not reasonable and necessary because the requested appropriation is the \u201cmaximum\u201d necessary to improve employee morale, asserting:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-5\">Also, the Chief Judge admitted at trial that he specifically asked for \u201cthe best [pension] plan that\u2019s available.\u201d Trial transcript at 342. In other words, the requested appropriation, by its own terms, comprises the <em>maximum </em>necessary to improve employee morale, not what was \u201creasonable and necessary\u201d to ensure that its employees could carry out the Trial Court\u2019s constitutional responsibilities.<footnotemark>[42]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">The statement that the requested appropriation is the <em>\u201cmaximum </em>necessary to improve employee morale\u201d is taken out of context. At trial, Judge Davis testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-7\">[U]nder the [old benefit package], you offer to pay a pension benefit to somebody that either is not sufficient or is barely sufficient to pay... [for] the group health care plan once they retire.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-8\">So 20 years of service, [and] out the door they go.. .. [Their health care costs] just [eat] up every nickel of [their pension]. And what are you living on? Social Security or your savings or maybe you get another job.<footnotemark>[43]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b231-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>With this pension deficit in mind, Judge Davis made the following statements regarding the \u201cmaximum\u201d pension:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-4\">So the time has come ... to recognize that these people have done what\u2019s been asked of them and I feel for a variety of reasons that we have... two glaring deficits in our overall structure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-5\">Number one, we have not a good pension circumstance with the MERS [Municipal Employees\u2019 Retirement System] pensions that are afforded to ... court people. Plus they are different county to county and I want unification. ... [T]hat\u2019s our goal. And so what I want from you is the best MERS plan that\u2019s available ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-7\">The second thing that is a glaring problem ... is there\u2019s no provision for these people when they leave work for any kind of healthcare. They\u2019re just on their own.... It\u2019s a problem in attracting people. It is a double-edged sword in that respect: In all the time I\u2019ve been involved in county government, I\u2019ve seen circumstances where people ... who should go because they are tired, they\u2019re worn out, they\u2019re sick ...; [but] they don\u2019t go because this is the only place they can get their medical benefits.... So I want some kind of medical retirement plan for these people.<footnotemark>[44]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">Judge Davis was' asserting that the \u201cmaximum\u201d pension is reasonable because the larger pension keeps the retirees from having to dip into their life savings or take a second job to pay for their living expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-9\">The lead opinion would establish as a rule of law that the \u201cmaximum\u201d benefit out of those available to a court could <em>never </em>be considered reasonable and necessary. But Judge Kolenda found that the \u201cmaximum\u201d pension was both necessary and reasonable under these specific circumstances, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-10\">The proposed pension upgrade is also not excessive. That it is the \u201ctop of the line\u201d pension available through <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>MERS does not mean that it is extravagant. First of all, being more generous than other pensions does not mean extravagant. It simply means more than something which is less....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-6\">Further buttressing the conclusion that the B-4 pension is not excessive is the fact that it is part of the benefit package which the Trial Court must provide in order to retain its employees and compete for qualified replacements. What is needed to he competitive cannot possibly be deemed excessive, even if somewhat generous.<footnotemark>[45]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">Under <em>In re </em>Miller,<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> clear error exists only when the appellate court \u201c \u2018is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made.\u2019 \u201d Review of the record does not show that Judge Kolenda clearly erred in finding that the enhanced pension plan and the retiree health care plan are reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b232-9\">As Judge Kolenda noted, the evidence in this case consists of six days of hearings, 14 witness testimonials, and 5,500 pages of exhibits. Judge Kolenda \u201cread and carefully considered\u201d all of the evidence before he held that the employee benefits were both reasonable and necessary. The lead opinion has failed to justify its \u201cdefinite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made.\u201d Without the facts necessary to establish a \u201cdefinite and firm conviction,\u201d the judgments of Judge Kolenda and the Court of Appeals should be upheld. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>The fact-finder has not clearly erred simply because the appellate court is convinced that it would have decided the case differently.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark></p>\n<judges id=\"b233-4\">Cavanagh and Kelly, JJ., concurred with Weaver, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b218-7\"> <em>Wayne Circuit Judges v Wayne Co (On Rehearing), </em>386 Mich 1, 9;
