A summons and complaint were served on the defendant Stevens on the 29th of September. The summons was entitled in the <em>supreme court, </em>but no court is mentioned in the complaint. On the 17th of October, the defendant Stevens, who resides at Batavia, and appears in person, served papers for this motion, by mailing the same at the place of his residence, upon the plaintiff\u2019s attorney, who resides at Albany. The term for which the motion was noticed was held on the 28th of Octo<em>ber\u2014eleven </em>days after the papers were mailed. The papers were, in fact, received by the plaintiff\u2019s attorney on the 19th of October. On the next day the defendant served upon the plaintiff\u2019s attorney, personally, a notice that at the same special term mentioned in the former notice he would move upon the papers, copies of which had been mailed on the 17th of October, at Batavia, to set aside the complaint.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b76-11\">The ground of the motion is, that the name of the court is not specified in the complaint.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b76-12\">W.

I was at first inclined to think the objection well taken : but I am satisfied that the defendant was entitled to use these papers in connection with the notice of the motion which had been personally served. When that notice was served, the papers were in the hands of the plaintiff\u2019s attorney. They were none the worse for the fact that they had come to his possession through the post-office. It was enough that he had them. Nothing could be gained by delivering new copies. They might be used, not because they had been served by mail, but because, by some means, they had come into the hands of the plaintiff\u2019s attorney, and were then in his possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">But upon the merits, this motion must fail. This precise question was decided in <em>Van Namee </em>agt. <em>Peoble, </em>(9 <em>How. Pr. R. </em>198.) Though there is a technical omission in the complaint, yet the defendant could not have been injured by it. Under such circumstances, the 176th section of the Code makes it the duty of the court to disregard the defect.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">The motion is denied, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
