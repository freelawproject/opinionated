The suit was originally commenced against the Albany Northern Railroad Company as sole defendant. The plaintiff alleged in his complaint that, on the 23d of July, 1852, he conveyed to the defendant a right of way over his land for the track of its road; and that, in and by the conveyance, the defendant covenanted and agreed to construct and maintain, over its road, certain crossings for the use of the plaintiff; and, although the defendant had accepted the conveyance and taken possession of the road, the crossings had not been constructed. The de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>fendant appeared and put in an answer, and on the 25th of March, the issue was noticed for trial at a special term to be held on the 14th of April. On the <em>first </em>of April the plaintiff, upon due notice, obtained an order that Chauncey Vibbard, John L. Schoolcraft and Andrew White, who had been appointed receivers of the Albany Northern Railroad Company, be added as parties defendants, and that the pleadings and proceedings be amended by adding said receivers as parties, and that the plaintiff have liberty to amend his complaint by inserting therein the necessary allegations to connect the said parties defendants with the cause of action set forth in the complaint. The receivers were not served with a copy of the order, or with a summons or complaint, but without further notice the plaintiff proceeded, on the 25th of April, to take judgment against all the defendants by default.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b344-5\">The judgment requires the Northern Railroad Company'to construct the specified crossings within sixty days after being served with a copy of the judgment, and also requires the defendants Chauncey Vibbard and others to pay to the plaintiff $250 damages, and $123.96 costs, out of any moneys that may have come to their hands, or might thereafter come to their hands, as receivers of the Northern Railroad Company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b344-6\">A copy of this judgment was served upon all the parties.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b344-7\">The defendants moved to set aside the judgment. All the defendants joined in the motion. The plaintiff also moved at the same time for a writ of assistance, or such other order, writ or process as the court might see fit to' grant, to compel the defendants to execute the judgment.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b344-8\">G. Van Santvoord, <em>for plaintiff.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b344-9\">John H. Reynolds and O.

Until served with process, the court has no jurisdiction over him: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>and yet, in this case, we have three persons made defendants in an action, and that action brought to trial, and final judgment rendered against them, without service of process, or any other notice except that an application would be. made for leave to sue them. *</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">The record of the judgment presents the anomaly of a suit commenced against one defendant, a complaint against the same defendant, and then a final judgment against three persons who are strangers to the pleadings: their names appear for the first time in the judgment. It needs but to state the facts to show that th\u00e9 proceedings cannot be upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">Nor was the plaintiff in a situation to proceed to. trial upon the issue already joined. Having obtained leave to amend the-complaint, he was required to serve a copy of the amended complaint upon all the defendants. The effect of amending was, to strike out the issue that had been joined. It was the right of the defendant, who had already answered, to put in a new <em>\u00b0 </em>answer to the amended complaint. <em>(See Ward </em>agt. <em>Dewey, </em>12 <em>How. </em>193.)</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">' The motion to set aside the judgment must be granted, and the plaintiff\u2019s motion denied. The plaintiff should be charged with the costs of one motion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
