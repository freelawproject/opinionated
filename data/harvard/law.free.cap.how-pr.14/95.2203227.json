But this cannot be done by merely serving <em>a notice </em>of discontinuance; an <em>order </em>must also be entered. <em>^See to 'tke same effect Uverill </em>agt. <em>Patterson, </em>10 <em>How.

The defendants retained an attorney,\u2014but before service on the plaintiff of a notice of appearance, although after the retainer, the plaintiff served on the defendant Fancher, a.notice of the discontinuance of the suit, without, however, entering an order of discontinuance. The defendants\u2019 attorney served, by mail, on the plaintiff a demand of a copy of the complaint; and, after waiting forty days, made this motion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b101-11\">Dudley &amp; Plants, <em>for defendants,</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b101-12\">E.

(\u00a7 130 <em>of Code, </em>5 <em>How, Pr. R. </em>124.) In this case, as no answer had been put in setting up a coun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>ter-claim, the plaintiff had the right to discontinue his suit without leave of the court. But this could not be done by merely serving a notice of discontinuance, without the entry of a rule or order to that effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">It was decided, in <em>Averill </em>agt. <em>Patterson, </em>(10 <em>How. Pr. R. </em>85,) that the practice of requiring the entry of a rule of discontinuance, which prevailed before the adoption of the Code, was still in force. <em>(See </em>\u00a7 469 <em>of the </em>Code, <em>and rule </em>90.)</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">The plaintiff in this case, having omitted to enter an order of discontinuance, his notice to that effect was ineffectual to discontinue the suit. The defendant Fancher is, therefore, regular in making this motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">If the plaintiff had entered an order of discontinuance, the defendant\u2019s attorneys would not, under the decision of the court of errors in <em>Smith </em>agt. White, (7 <em>Hill, </em>520,) have been entitled to costs. That case decides, that if a suit is discontinued before service of a notice of appearance, although after an actual retainer, the attorney of the defendant is not entitled to any costs. A contrary decision was made in <em>Foster </em>agt. <em>Bowen. </em>(1 <em>Code Rep. N. S. </em>236; <em>Code, Voorh. 4th ed. </em>509.)</p>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">An order for discontinuance must be entered, and the plaintiff must pay the defendants\u2019 attorneys\u2019 costs, allowed by the 307th section of the Code, and $7 costs on this motion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
