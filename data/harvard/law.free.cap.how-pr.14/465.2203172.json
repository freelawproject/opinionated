It does not show anything in contempt of Judge Davies\u2019 order of 17th of September, 1856, under which the examination was being had : the order does not require, after discovery of property, the expenses of searches.

This <em>court </em>has no jurisdiction of proceedings supplementary to execution, <em>(Code, chap. </em>2,) except upon an application founded upon an affidavit that the judgment-debtor <em>unjustly refuses to apply his property </em>towards the satisfaction of the judgment. This case is not within its provisions. This case is one coming under such proceedings as are provided, <em>upon the return of an execution. </em>The act contemplates such case as this to belong <em>exclusively </em>to a <em>judge out of court. (See fore part of\u00a7 </em>292.) But the case of unjustly refusing to apply property to the satisfaction of the judgment, may come before the court, or a judge thereof, at the <em>option of a judgment-creditor, </em>and <em>before a return of the execution; {see middle part of </em>\u00a7 292;) the act thus making two distinct classes of cases, each requiring a different course of proceeding in many particulars. This proceeding belongs exclusively to the judge before whom it was instituted, unless he can avoid it by Code; (\u00a7\u00a7 27, 404;) and there is no such evidence furnished on this motion by the applicant for the order.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b473-7\">\u201c But this court, at <em>general </em>term, has jurisdiction on appeal to review doings under proceedings supplementary to execution. <em>(Code, </em>\u00a7 349.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b473-8\">\u20184. All the proceedings in this matter not before the judge who commenced them, or the referee appointed by him, are <em>void, </em>mere <em>nullities: </em>it is a proceeding unknown to the common law, a creature of the statute which must be strictly followed. The judge is authorized, <em>ex officio, </em>to entertain such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>proceedings; he is <em>only a commissioner </em>for that purpose; he cannot delegate his power; he alone can punish for a contempt to him or his order; everything must be before him, <em>as such judge. </em>How can the <em>court, </em>or another judge, mete out the punishment adequate to his wounded feelings? The judge cannot mix himself up with the rules, &amp;c., applying to <em>actions in court. </em>He has no more right to act, as a <em>court, </em>or to employ the powers belonging to him while using the functions of a judge in court, than has a judge to carry his orders into <em>court </em>and enter them of record in the minutes while hearing an <em>insolvent case, </em>a <em>case of habeas corpus, </em>or <em>proceeding under the non-imprisonment act, </em>which he may entertain out of court by virtue of his office as judge, and which come before him only as a <em>commissioner. </em>He is called a <em>commissioner </em>in such cases. <em>(Vide ex parte Beatty, </em>12 <em>Wend. </em>229.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b474-5\">\u201cIn the nature of things, and by the statute also, <em>the judge </em>whose order is disobeyed'must see to the punishment himself\u2014 <em>it is personal to him, </em>and not to another, <em>(Code, </em>\u00a7 302,) and cannot come within \u00a7 27 of the Code. The <em>court </em>(\u00a7 302) may punish when the proceeding is before it, in a case of <em>refusal to apply, </em>&amp;c., as in \u00a7 292; hence the use of the words, in \u00a7 302, \u201cby the court (\u00ab\"\"judge,\u201d having reference to the two distinct classes of cases in \u00a7 292, the one on <em>return offi.fa., </em>the jurisdiction of which exclusively belonging to <em>a judge, </em>the other on <em>issuing afi. fa., </em>and a refusal, the jurisdiction of which being, at the option of the creditor, in the <em>court </em>or to a <em>judge.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b474-6\">\u201cThe law is not different now, since the Revised Statutes. <em>(Vide </em>2 <em>R. S. p. </em>555.) A judge at court, then, could not punish for a contempt, but <em>for </em>express enactment; and the inferior court never could punish on his account but for \u00a7 33 of that statute, <em>(p. </em>539.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b474-7\">\u201c The- only authority, either in the Code or in the old Revised Statutes, to punish for the contempt alleged in the order to show cause, is in \u00a7 302 of the Code. That must be done by the <em>judge, out of court, </em>and <em>as a </em>commissioner, <em>standing alone and independent of the court of which he may be a member. </em>That is not this case, for which the order was granted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b475-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>\u201c5.

The magistrate, without having gained jurisdiction of the person by having him before him in the manner required by law, <em>(see order to show cause,) </em>the proceedings are void; and in the case of a limited and special jurisdiction, the magistrate attempting to enforce a <em>proceeding </em>founded on any judgment, sentence, or conviction, in such a case becomes a trespasser. <em>Bigelow </em>agt. <em>Stearns, </em>19 <em>John. </em>39.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b475-8\">Inferior jurisdictions, not proceeding according to the course of the common law, cannot enlarge their authority by implication.

He may not have the information asked for, or any of it. He may be, as he, by his answer, which is under oath, says he is, unable to state any of the incumbrances which were on his property six months before the lime of the examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-11\">The question does not look to a discovery of property, but to a discovery of incumbrances on it; and he may not be bound in this proceeding to discover those incumbrances: this will depend on the form of the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-12\">The defendant has given an answer, in substance, that he is unable to give the information sought by the question. This answer is not necessarily evasive, or a refusal to comply with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>the order: at any rate, I cannot so decide in the absence of evidence of the order, which it is said he disobeys.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">The order requiring the defendant to answer was made, not by the court, but by a justice of the court, and was or should have been returnable before him, but whether it was in fact so or not does not appear. The examination, to be sure, could, under certain circumstances, proceed before another justice, and whether it did so proceed, and whether the hearing on the return of it was before him or another, does not appear.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">The order by which the proceeding got before a referee is not among the moving papers, and there is no sufficient evidence of the authority of the referee to require defendant to answer, or of what is required by the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">Neither the original order initiating the proceedings, nor any order of reference appears ; nor is there sufficient evidence of the terms or substance of either.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">For disobedience of an order of a justice out of court, the punishment should be administered by the justice whose order is disobeyed, and on the papers read on the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-9\">I think that I cannot order the defendant punished for contempt.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
