Charles Mason, a justice of this court, and a jury', on the 17th day of December, 1856, and the verdict of the jury having been entered, whereby they find the title of the property described in the complaint to be in the defendant, and that the jury have assessed the value of the personal property-described in the complaint, at the sum of one hundred and fifty dollars, and the damages for the detention thereof at ten dollars, and it being made to appear to the court now here that the personal property described in the complaint, to wit, one \u25a0 gray mare, has been delivered to the plaintiff: now, on motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>of Bates and Countryman, <em>attorneys for </em>the defendant, it is adjudged that the defendant recover possession of the personal property described in the complaint, viz., one gray mare, and that the same be returned to him, or in case a return and delivery thereof cannot be had, then that the said defendant recover of the plaintiff the said sum of one hundred and fifty dollars, the value of the same property assessed as aforesaid, and further, that the said defendant recover of the said plaintiff the sum of ten dollars damages as aforesaid, and also the sum of fifty-seven dollars and forty-three cents, costs and disbursements, amounting together to the sum of sixty-seven dollars and forty-three cents.

The authorities show that the alleged cause of action upon which the suit was brought, arose when the defendant refused to give up the mare on the demand of the plaintiff, and executors and administrators should sue in their own right in such a case, and never in their representative character, <em>only </em>where the testator or intestate had a <em>complete </em>cause of action in his lifetime. (5 Cowen, 267; 4 <em>id. </em>87; 11 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number><em>Johns. 403; 10 East, </em>,293; 9 <em>Wend. </em>486; <em>Gra. Pr. 2d ed. </em>739.) It was well settled, prior to the Code, that an executor or administrator was personally liable for costs in an action on a demand not <em>necessarily </em>prosecuted in his representative capacity. (3 <em>Hill, </em>441; 4 <em>id. </em>571 <em>Denio, </em>626; <em>also see the authorities before cited.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">Section forty-one, of title three, chapter six, of the second part of the Revised Statutes, (2R. <em>S.p. </em>90,) which is in force by reason of a clause in section 317 of the Code, relates only to actions brought <em>against </em>executors and administrators, and not to such as are brought by them : and section, seventeen, of title one, chapter ten, of the third part of the Revised Statutes, (2 <em>R. S. p. </em>615,) which exempted executors and administrators from liability for costs in certain actions prosecuted by them, is repealed by the Code. <em>(Code </em>\u00a7468; <em>Curtis </em>agt. <em>Dutton, </em>4 <em>Sand. </em>719.)</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">Section 317 of the Code, embraces the entire subject provided for in the above-mentioned section seventeen of the Revised Statutes. This section of the Revised Statutes is inconsistent with section 317 of the Code, and it is not saved from the effect of the repealing part of the Code, by \u00a7471 of the Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">Section 317 of the Code declares that, in an action prosecuted by an executor or administrator, costs shall be recovered <em>as in an action by and against a person prosecuting in his own </em>right, <em>but such costs shall be chargeable only upon or collected of the estate represe?ited, </em>unless <em>the court </em>shall direct the same to be paid by the plaintiff <em>personally, </em>for mismanagement or bad faith in such action. Under this section, if an executor or administrator fails in an action prosecuted by him in his representative capacity, the defendant recovers costs as matter of course, to be collected of the estate represented <em>; </em>but he cannot enter judgment for costs against the plaintiff personally, unless <em>the court </em>directs the same to be paid by the plaintiff personally, \u201c for mismanagement or bad faith in such action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">There must now be a direction of the court, to authorize a defendant to enter judgment for costs against an executor or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>administrator personally, in an action not <em>necessarily </em>prosecuted in the right of his testator or intestate. <em>(See </em>12 <em>How. Pr. Rep. </em>305.)</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">The court did not direct that the plaintiff pay the costs of the action personally, therefore the judgment for costs against him personally was erroneous, The order appealed from must be reversed, and the judgment for costs against the plaintiff personally, set aside, with $10 costs of the appeal, and $10 costs of the motion to set aside the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">Order accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
