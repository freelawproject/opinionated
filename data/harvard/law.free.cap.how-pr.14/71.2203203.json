(1 <em>Den. </em>57 ; 10 <em>Wend. </em>540.)</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">It is a well established rule, that a tenant whose possession is entirely distinct from that for which the action is brought, is not affected by a recovery in such action, and cannot be dispossessed under a writ of possession issued therein. (1 <em>Caines\u2019 R. </em>500; <em>Adams on Eject. </em>309.)</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">\u201c The Albany, Vermont and Canada Railroad Company \u201d cannot, under the 121st section of the Code, be added or substituted as a party in this action, unless the cause of action survives or continues in favor of the plaintiff, and against such company. As there is in this action but one defendant, there is no survivorship, as that term implies that the cause of action became vested in or against a survivor. Did the action continue in favor of the plaintiff, and against \u201c The Albany, Vermont and Canada Railroad Company!\u201d If it did not, that company cannot be added or substituted as a party.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-8\">In <em>Putnam </em>agt. <em>Van Buren, </em>(7 <em>How. Pr. R. </em>33,) Justice Willard, delivering the opinion of the general term of the fourth district, held, that the cause of action for the recovery of land involved two ideas: <em>First, </em>The title of the plaintiff to the premises claimed, and a right to recover the possession thereof: <em>Second, </em>The actual occupancy thereof by the defendant: that, in case of the defendant\u2019s death, the second element of the cause of action did not continue ; and that, by the death of the original defendant, a new cause of action was given to the plaintiff, provided a new occupant succeeded to the possession. This reasoning is applicable to the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>An indispensable element of the cause of action for which the plaintiff\u2019s action was brought against \u201c The Albany Northern Railroad Company,\u201d was the actual occupancy by that company, and their withholding the possession from the plaintiff. This was a malfeasance personal to that company; and when the interest of that company in the premises was transferred to Burden, and by him to \u201cThe Albany, Vermont and Canada Railroad Company,\u201d and the latter-company entered into the possession, arid withheld such possession from the plaintiff, a new cause of action against that company, originating in the malfeasance of the latter company accrued to the plaintiff; but the old cause of action against \u201c The Albany Northern Railroad Company,\u201d does not continue against \u201c The Albany, Vermont and Canada Railroad Company.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">A cause of action founded in tort, as for example, an entry into the lands of another, and the unlawful withholding from him the possession thereof, is personal to the tortfeasor : it dies with his person, and cannot at common law be continued against his grantee by a transfer of his interest in the real property in respect to which the tort was committed. (7 <em>How. Pr. R. </em>32, 33; <em>Mit. Plead. Jer. ed. </em>22; 1 <em>Saund. </em>72; <em>Adams on Eject. </em>309. <em>See Norton </em>agt. <em>Wiswall, ante, page </em>42.)</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">The same proposition may be affirmed in respect to a trespass in cutting timber by a tenant at will, or for years; or to waste committed by a tenant for life, or years.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">In general, where a defendant, in an action for the recovery of real property, transfers his possession <em>pendente lite </em>to a third person, the suit may be continued against the original defendant without notice to the grantee, and upon the judgment and writ of possession in such action, such grantee may be dispossessed. (1 <em>Cai. R. </em>500; <em>Adams on Eject. </em>309; 5 <em>Johns. Ch. R. </em>39; 7 <em>Paige, </em>21.)</p>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">The motion, for the reasons above stated, must be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-9\">As the question arising on this motion is new, m respect to the circumstances under which it is presented, I will deny the motion without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
