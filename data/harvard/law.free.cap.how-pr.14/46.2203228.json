By means of which several premises the plaintiff was then greatly hurt, bruised and wounded, and became and was sick, sore, lame, and disordered, to the great damage and injury of the plaintiff.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b53-10\">The complaint contains a demand for a judgment against the defendant for five hundred dollars damages, besides costs : and it is duly verified.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b53-11\">The defendant\u2019s answer is, that he \u201c denies that, at the time and place stated in the complaint, or at any other time and place, he ever plucked, pulled and tore divers large quantities of hair from and off the head of the plaintiff\"; or that he then and there, or at any other time, ever, with his fists, gave and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>struck the plaintiff divers violent blows and strokes upon any part of his person; or that he ever struck the plaintiff at all; or that he ever kicked the plaintiff at the time and place mentioned in the complaint, or at any other time or place.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b54-5\">But the defendant states the truth to be, that on the 3d day of July, 1856, the children of the defendant\u2014one son about twelve years of age, and two sons and one daughter, younger than his said son\u2014were attending school at some little distance from the residence of the defendant, in a quiet and peaceable manner; that while attending said school, and going to and returning from the same, from and to the residence of the de fend ant, the plaintiff, on the 3d day of July, 1856, at Oxford, violently, and with force and arms, assaulted the said four infant children of the defendant, and made divers and sundry violent and harsh threats, at the said children of the defendant; and swore at them ; and followed the said children in and along the road to and from said school, and into said school-house, with a horsewhip, threatening to beat them, and striking with said whip at one or more of said children, all of which said treatment to, and acts and doings of the plaintiff, towards the said children the defendant was informed of on the said 3d day of July, and then believed, and now believes, the same to be true. And that on the said 3d day of July, the plaintiff, while so treating and abusing the said children as aforesaid, as the defendant was informed, and then believed, and now believes to be true, threatened the defendant, and said he would treat and abuse the defendant in the same manner as he had and did the said children, or words to that effect; and sent word to the defendant that he would do so; and for this defendant to come and see him. That the defendant went to see the plaintiff on the said 3d day of July, to learn the reasons of the plaintiff\u2019s treatment to and towards the said children of the defendant; and that the plaintiff then and there threatened the defendant, and used abusive and insulting language to him; and then and there threatened his said children; and that he would continue to abuse and maltreat the said children of the defendant; and this defendant admits that, after all this, being exasperated, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>did 'take hold of the plaintiff, on the said 3d day of July, and shook him some, and pushed him over on the ground; which he was provoked and exasperated to do by the plaintiff, for the reasons aforesaid.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b55-5\">The answer contains a demand for a judgment for costs of the action against the plaintiff: and it is duly verified. The plaintiff moved, at a special term in Chenango county, in August, 1856, to strike out of the answer all after the denial contained in the answer, as irrelevant, redundant and frivolous; or that judgment be rendered for the plaintiff; or for such other rule, order, relief, or judgment as to the court might seem meet; and for costs of the motion. And upon such motion the court made an order, that the plaintiff have judgment in the action, on account of the frivolousness of the answer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b55-6\">The defendant has appealed from this order to. the general term.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b55-7\">R.

If the action could be tried upon the complaint and answer, the plaintiff would be entitled to a verdict for nominal damages, without-making any proof whatever; and the defendant could not deprive him of such a verdict by proving all the allegations contained in his answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-10\">The statement in the complaint, that the defendant, on the 3d day of July, 1856, at Oxford, with force and violence, assaulted the plaintiff, and seized and laid hold of the plaintiff, is not denied or avoided by any allegations in the answer. The denials and statements of new matter, in the answer,, merely controvert the aggravating circumstances that the complaint shows attended the commission of the assault and battery, which is therein charged against the defendant. Circumstances of aggravation, in actions for assaults and batteries, never were traversable. <em>(Bates </em>agt. Loomis, 5 <em>Wend. </em>134.) A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>defendant did not admit such matters by not pleading to the declaration, prior to the Code. (5 <em>Wend. </em>134; <em>Gra. Pr. 2d, ed. </em>798, &amp;c.)</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">Is the answer frivolous <em>1 </em>If the case of <em>Lane </em>agt. <em>Gilbert </em>(9 <em>How. Pr. R. </em>150) is to be followed, it is clearly frivolous. The defendant\u2019s counsel insist that an answer in an action for an assault and battery, may contain new matter, that goes only in mitigation of the plaintiff\u2019s damages. They rely upon <em>Stiles </em>agt. <em>Comstock, </em>(9 <em>How. Pr. R. </em>48,) <em>Heaton </em>agt, <em>Wright, </em>(10 <em>id. </em>79,) and <em>Herr </em>agt. <em>Bamberg, (id. </em>128,) to establish this position. They were all actions for slander, in which the Code expressly permits the defendant to allege, in his answer, any mitigating circumstances, to reduce the amount of damages, <em>(Code, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 164, 165.) These decisions are therefore inapplicable to the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">A frivolous answer has been defined to be, one which, if true, does not contain any defence to <em>any part </em>of the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action. <em>(Nichols </em>agt. <em>Jones, </em>6 <em>How. Pr. R. </em>355; <em>Leach </em>agt. <em>Boynton, </em>3 <em>Abbott\u2019s Rep. </em>1.) An answer that merely controverts allegations of the complaint is frivolous, <em>unless </em>it contains a denial of some <em>material </em>allegation of the complaint. <em>(Temple </em>agt. <em>Murray, </em>6 <em>How. Pr. R. </em>329; <em>Hull </em>agt. <em>Smith, </em>8 <em>id. </em>149; <em>Edson </em>agt. <em>Dillaye, id. </em>273; <em>Lane </em>agt. <em>Gilbert, </em>9 <em>id. </em>150; 10 <em>id. </em>457.) An answer that only controverts the allegations of the complaint, is frivolous, if it does not put in issue some allegation, which the plaintiff must establish, to entitle him to a verdict. The answer in this action, so far as it contains denials only, fails to do this, and is therefore frivolous. (5 <em>Wend. </em>134.)</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">The statements of new matter in the answer, do not constitute a defence to the action, or a counter-claim. <em>(Code, </em>\u00a7 150; 12 <em>How. Prac. Rep. </em>310. <em>Kneedler </em>agt. <em>Sternburgh, </em>10 <em>id. </em>67; <em>Drake </em>agt. <em>Cockcroft, id. </em>382; 7 <em>id. 123, </em>294, 303.) A counter-claim need not be sufficient to defeat the whole of the cause of action against which it is interposed; but any other defence, consisting of new matter, except in actions for libel and slander, must be an answer to the entire cause of action, to which it is set up. (10 <em>How. Pr. R. </em>68.) The answer is frivolous, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>within these rules, so far as it sets up new matter as a defence to the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">A defendant, by suffering a default., or by omitting to deny the allegations of the complaint, only admits the truth of such allegations in the complaint as the plaintiff would be obliged to prove, in order to recover upon an issue formed by a general denial of each and every allegation in the complaint. His default only admits the material and traversable matters set out in the complaint. (5 <em>Wend. </em>134.) In other words, the omission of the defendant to answer is a confession <em>only </em>of the material allegations in the complaint, which must be established to entitle the plaintiff to a judgment. <em>(Code, </em>\u00a7 168; <em>Fry </em>agt. <em>Bennett, </em>5 <em>Sand. 54; Newman </em>agt. <em>Otto, </em>4 <em>Sand. </em>668; <em>Harlow </em>agt. <em>Hamilton, </em>6 <em>How. Pr. R. </em>475.) The decision in <em>The Mayor of Albany </em>agt. <em>Cunliff, </em>(2 <em>Com. </em>170, 171,) does not conflict with these views.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">A default of a defendant, for not answering, in an action for an assault and battery, entitles the plaintiff to, a judgment, for <em>only nominal -damages. (Bates </em>agt. <em>Loomis, </em>5 <em>Wend. </em>134; <em>Gra. Pr. 2d ed. </em>797-799.) If he claims more damages, he must prove the facts that will entitle him to recover them.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">When a party suffers an inquest to be taken against him at the circuit, there is authority for saying that he thereby loses the right to produce testimony and examine witnesses <em>on his part, </em>and is restricted to the right of cross-examining the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses. <em>(Green </em>agt. <em>Willis, </em>1 <em>Wend. </em>78; <em>Gra. Pr. 2d ed. 292, </em>293.) But I am unable to find any authority that thus restricts the defendant\u2019s rights, on the assessment of damages, either at the circuit or before a sheriff\u2019s jury, when judgment goes against him by default for not answering the complaint; <em>(see Foster </em>agt. <em>Smith, </em>10 <em>Wend. </em>377; 5 <em>id. </em>563; 1 <em>Hill, </em>101; <em>Gra. Pr. 2d ed. </em>798, 799;) and I think there is no such authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-8\">In <em>Saltus </em>agt. <em>Kipp, </em>(12 <em>How. Pr. R. </em>342,) which was an action for an assault and battery, Bosworth, Justice, says,\u2014 <em>A defendant may call witnesses, </em>on the assessment of damages, upon a writ of inquiry, and prove any matter which prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>erly goes to mitigate damages.\u201d The case of <em>Lane </em>agt. <em>Gilbert </em>holds the same principle. The defendant in this action may call witnesses, on the assessment of the plantiff\u2019s damages, whether they shall be assessed by a sheriff\u2019s jury, upon, a writ of inquiry, or otherwise, to prove all proper mitigating facts and circumstances connected with the commission of the assault and battery upon the plaintiff. Hence there is no necessity for answering the complaint in the action. The defendant loses no right by being shut out from so doing; but he saves, by reason thereof, the costs of a trial at the circuit, with all its attending perplexities.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">The order that the plaintiff, have judgment in the action for the frivolousness of the answer, should be affirmed, with ten dollars, costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">Decision accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
