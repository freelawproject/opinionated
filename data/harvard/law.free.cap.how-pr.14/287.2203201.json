The defendant, in his answer, set up a counter-claim for costs and services as an attorney and counsellor at law. Issue was joined in December, 1849. The cause was referred ; but the referee having removed from the county, great delay has occurred in bringing the issue to trial. The plaintiff further states that the defendant is insolvent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b293-11\">The defendant claims that there is a large balance due to him, over and above any amount which he owes the plaintiff; and that, in case the plaintiff should be allowed to discontinue his action, his demand would be barred by the statute of limitations,</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b293-12\">George W.

Such a defence is called a <em>counter-claim. </em>There are, then, before the court two causes of action. If the defendant has denied the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action, and the plaintiff, by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>his reply, has denied the defendant\u2019s cause of action, there are, in fact, two distinct actions to be tried in one. Each is to be tried as though it were a separate action. Each party is entitled to affirmative relief, in respect to the cause of action he may establish, and the final judgment is in favor of the one party or the other, according to the amount recovered. <em>(See Davidson </em>agt. Remington, 12 <em>How. </em>310.)</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">The subject has been well considered by Mr. Justice Mitchell, in <em>The Seaboard, and Roanoke Railroad Company </em>agt. <em>Ward, </em>(18 <em>Barb. </em>595.) In that case it was held that the plaintiff might discontinue his action at any time before the time for replying to a counter-claim should expire. But after the plaintiff has put in his reply, the defendant has an absolute right, in case he succeeds upon the trial, to have an affirmative judgment in his favor. Then he can discontinue only upon obtaining leave from the court. The same view was taken by the superior court of New-York, in <em>Cockle </em>agt. <em>Underwood. </em>(1 <em>Abbott, </em>1.)</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">\u2022 In this case it would be obviously unjust to allow the plaintiff to discontinue. By commencing and continuing this action for about seven years, he has prevented the defendant from suing upon his demand, until now the statute of limitations would be an effectual bar to any action that might be commenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">The motion must, therefore, be denied. The costs of opposing should abide the event. In case there should be any further difficulty in procuring the attendance of the referee, another person should be substituted in his place. And, notwithstanding the former order denying a motion for that purpose, the plaintiff should be allowed to renew his application.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
