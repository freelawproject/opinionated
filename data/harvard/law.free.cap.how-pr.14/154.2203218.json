But, in an action for the foreclosure of a mortgage, although many besides the mortgagor or his co-contractors, whether principal or sureties, are necessary parties: yet I do not agree with the defendant\u2019s counsel, that no valid judgment can be rendered in this kind of action without making a person a defendant, with whom the mortgagor has entered into a written contract to convey the premises. But, although not indispensable, I think it is proper; and, as it is possible some embarrassment may happen to the defendant Shaw, if Gori should not be joined with him ; and, as the Code gives the court great latitude in this respect, I will direct that the latter be made a defendant before a final determination of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-12\">Order accordingly\u2014costs to abide event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
