By the terms of the bill of lading executed by the captain, the flour on arrival was to be delivered to <em>Nason fy Collins, </em>they paying the freight. A day or two after, before the vessel was ready to sail, information arrived that Nason &amp; Collins had stopped payment. The flour was accordingly seized, and, by virtue of a sequestration, executed by the sheriff of New Orleans, \u201c came again into the possession of I-Iogan &amp; Murphy,\u201d who, on the 8th of the same month, reshipped it in the same vessel, the captain engaging, by a new bill of lading, to deliver it at New-Yorlc to the firm of <em>Adams </em>4\" <em>Buckingham, </em>instead of Nason &amp; Collins.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b468-5\">Woodbury &amp; Churchill, <em>for plaintiffs.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b468-6\">Edwards &amp; Man, <em>for defendants.</em></attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b468-7\">Roosevelt, Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"ACT\">On its arrival here, the flour, as might have been anticipated, is claimed by both sets of consignees, or those deriving under them; and the question is, can the owners of the vessel, under such circumstances, file a bill of interpleader, and refuse to deliver to either of the claimants.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">As a general rule, such a proceeding is allowable where the party claims no interest himself, and is the subject of conflicting claims by others, which he cannot determine writhout hazard to himself. <em>(Atkinson </em>agt. <em>Manks, </em>1 <em>Cow. </em>691.)</p>\n<p id=\"b468-9\">But cases like the present are an exception. Here the captain, before he accepted the second shipment, had full notice. He knew, or had every reason to believe, that difficulty would or might arise out of the first bill of lading. He signed the second with his eyes open, and thereby virtually engaged, whatever might happen, to deliver the flour to the newly-named consignees. If, therefore, he did not intend to do so, it was a deception on his part. Such a deception we are not to presume. At all events, his owners cannot be heard to make such a defence : they are estopped by the second bill of lading. They cannot set up matter previously occurring, and of which they were cognizant. (2 <em>Mylne </em>&amp; <em>Craig, </em>1.) A tenant, accept<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>ing a lease (and the case is an analogous one) cannot, when called upon to pay the stipulated rent, dispute the title of his landlord ; nor can he compel his landlord to interplead with some alleged paramount claimant. Unless enjoined, he must pay his rent as stipulated. He has no right himself to initiate a litigation. So with a common carrier, whether by land or water; if he accepts property to carry, as the property of A., he has no right to dispute A.\u2019s ownership. He must deliver according to order, and according to agreement, and take his chance for the consequences. Fraud or insolvency might create an exception; but neither of those grounds is presented here. \u2022For although Nason &amp; Collins may have failed, their assignees, as far as appears, are perfectly responsible, as also Adams &amp; Buckingham.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">The demurrer must therefore be allowed, and the hill dismissed with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
