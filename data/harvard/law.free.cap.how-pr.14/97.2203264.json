That is, in an action, arising on contract, by the 149th and 150th sections of the Code, the defendant may avail himself of <em>any other cause of action </em>arising also on contract, and existing at the commencement of the action, by way of a counter-claim; whereas by the Revised Statutes the set off must be a demand for real estate sold, or for personal property sold, or for money paid, or services done; or if it be not such a demand, the amount must be liquidated or capable of being ascertained by calculation.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b103-8\">By the Revised Statutes, the set off can only be allowed <em>in actions </em>founded upon demands which could themselves be the subject of set off according to law.

Alleging that it was founded on a demand due from the plaintiff to the defendant upon <em>contract, </em>will not do; for there are a large number of demands on contract which would not themselves be the subject of a set off under the Revised Statutes.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b103-10\">There is nothing in the Code requiring a defendant to avail himself of a counterclaim in'an action, or in default thereof be <em>precluded </em>from maintaining an action.

The defendant in his answer alleges, that before the commencement of this action on, &amp;c., he commenced a suit against the plaintiff, by summons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>for the recovery of a certain demand due from the plaintiff to the defendant, upon contract, before John G. Bixby, one of the justices of the peace of, &amp;c.; that such suit is still pending, and that the cause of action in the plaintiff\u2019s complaint accrued to the plaintiff, and might have been set off in the suit commenced by the defendant against the plaintiff, and is still pending before the justice.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b104-5\">The plaintiff demurred to this answer.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b104-6\">Bissell &amp; Ballard, <em>for plaintiff.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b104-7\">Bangs &amp; Summerfield, <em>for defendant.</em></attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b104-8\">Marvin, Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"Aaj\">The demurrer is well taken. The answer does not state new matter constituting a <em>defence. </em>The Revised Statutes authorize, in certain cases and under certain circumstances, a defendant to set off demands which he has against the plaintiff. (2 R. <em>S. </em>234, \u00a7 48.) By the third subdivision of this section the set off must be a demand for real estate sold, or for personal property sold, or for money paid, or services done; or if it be not such a demand, the amount <em>must be liquidated, </em>or <em>capable of being ascertained by calculation. </em>By the 5th subdivision of the section, the set off can only be allowed <em>in actions founded upon demands </em>which could themselves be the subject of set off according to law. By \u00a7 55, if the defendant neglect to plead or give notice of any set off, which, according to the preceding pro visions,,might have been allowed to him, on the trial of the cause, he shall be forever thereafter precluded from maintaining an action to recover the same, or any part thereof. The answer should have stated facts, to bring the case within the provisions contained in \u00a7 48: that is, it should have stated facts showing that the action brought by the defendant against the plaintiff in the justice\u2019s court, was an action founded upon demands which could themselves be the subject of set off.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-9\">The defendant alleges that his action in the justice\u2019s court was upon contract; but he states no facts to show the nature of the contract. It may have been an action to recover dam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>ages for a breach of warranty in the sale of a horse, or for a failure to perform an agreement to clear land, or erect a house, in which the damages were not liquidated, nor capable of being ascertained by calculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">If such was the nature of the action in the justice\u2019s court, the present plaintiff could not, in that action, by the Revised Statutes, set off the demand in his present action; and he is only precluded by \u00a7 55 from maintaining an action to recover any set off which, by the preceding provisions of the statute, might have been allowed to him. An answer of new matter which does not state facts sufficient to <em>constitute a defence </em>is always insufficient, and may be demurred to.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">The provisions of the Code, in relation to counter-claim, is much more comprehensive than the Revised Statutes relating to set off. Thus by \u00a7\u00a7 149, 150, the defendant, in an action arising on contract, may avail himself of any other cause of action arising on contract, and existing at the commencement of the action. It may well be that the present plaintiff could have availed himself of his present cause of action, by way of counter-claim, in the action commenced against him by the present defendant, in the justice\u2019s court; but there is nothing in the Code requiring him so to avail himself, or, in default thereof, that he should be precluded from maintaining an action. We must go to the Revised Statutes for the <em>preclusion </em>from maintaining the action; and such preclusion can only be applied <em>to </em>the cases specified in the Revised Statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">Judgment for the plaintiff upon the demurrer to the answer.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
