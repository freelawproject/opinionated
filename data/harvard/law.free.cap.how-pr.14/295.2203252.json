Townsend, <em>for plaintiffs.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b301-11\">M.

Feeling the highest respect for any opinion of that learned judge; it is with great diffidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>that I venture to say that I am unable to agree with him in his understanding of that case. As I read it, it decides only that, on <em>demurrer to the pleading </em>of a justice\u2019s judgment,\u2014(which pleading alleges that a summons was <em>\u201cduly </em>issued and <em>personally </em>served,\u201d)\u2014the words <em>\u201cduly issued </em>\u201d could not be true, had the defendant <em>not been a resident of the county </em>where, &amp;c., and that the cause of demurrer assigned, <em>\u201c that it did not appear that the defendant was a resident of the </em>county,\u201d &amp;c., was not good cause ; and the demurrer was overruled: and the true purport of that decision seems to me to go no further than that the judgment was <em>{as pleaded) prima facie </em>valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">No such rule applies to the case on trial. It is here <em>proved </em>that, by <em>law, </em>the justice had no approximation to jurisdiction. He has <em>not, </em>by statute, jurisdiction, by long summons, over <em>all persons residing in his county; </em>but only over those who (residing in the county) <em>also </em>reside in his own town, or in a town adjoining his own town; or where the <em>plaintiff </em>resides in the same town with the justice, or in and adjoining one. <em>Ml other </em>residents of his county are as effectually out of the reach of his long summons\u2014(though it be, in the words of the court, his \u201c usual and regular\u201d process)\u2014as if they resided out of the state. And, further, as to <em>any one </em>kind of process issued by a justice, I see not how it is to be designated his \u201cusual and regular \u201d <em>process; </em>inasmuch as <em>all </em>his processes are given to him by <em>positive enactment; </em>and each, <em>{in its appropriate cases,) </em>is as \u201cusual and regular\u201d as any other.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">The <em>reason </em>of the statute (restricting the powers of a justice to cases which belong to his neighborhood) was never more manifest than in this case. A plaintiff residing within a mile or two of the city of Troy, sues two defendants, one living in Troy, and the other within three miles of Troy, (at Lansing-burgh,) and (as if for the express purpose of <em>vexation) </em>gets a summons from a justice of the town of Hoosick, some twenty-five miles distant from either of the parties! Is it the law, that a plaintiff may thus defy the express provisions of the statute, and put a defendant to the expense and inconvenience of going to the extreme part of the county, to prevent being subjected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>to a judgment for just so much as (in defendant\u2019s absence) a justice can be hoodwinked into giving 1 If it be, it is high time the law were altered.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">It must be decreed that said judgment is utterly void ; and that the same be cancelled of record ; and that all proceedings had on or under the same be set aside, and all future proceedings thereon forever prohibited. And further, that the plaintiffs recover of said defendant their costs in this action.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
