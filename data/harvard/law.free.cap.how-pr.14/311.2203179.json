B. being duly sworn, says he is plaintiff\u2019s attorney in this action, and that the foregoing complaint is true to the knowledge of this deponent, except as to those matters stated \"on information and belief, and as to those matters he believes it to be true. And deponent further says, that the drafts or bills of exchange set out in the complaint are both in the possession of deponent; <em>and he has heard defendant, </em>in talking of same, admit, or at least assume, that they were genuine, and that he had the money thereon from the plaintiff; and <em>the same information </em>has been communicated to deponent by the president of said bank\u2014(the plaintiff.)\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b317-13\">In verifying the answer, (also done by the attorney,) there was no pretence of <em>giving any grounds of his belief.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b318-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>Complaint and answer, both, were entirely \u201c on information and belief;\u201d and complaint contained material averments besides the mere genuineness of the drafts, and that defendant had the money thereon from plaintiff.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b318-5\">\n<em>--, for plaintiff,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b318-6\">\n<em>--,for defendant.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b318-8\">Gould, Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"AfK\">I consider the case in <em>10th Howard, </em>185, as containing the true doctrine to be applied to verifications like the one to the complaint in this cause. When a pleading is \u201c on information and belief,\u201d and the attorney makes the affidavit, he must give <em>the grounds of his belief, </em>and the <em>sufficiency </em>of those grounds is a question for the courts to determine. The first of these positions I deem clearly required, and properly so, by the Code; the second is founded on the plainest and soundest reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-9\">It by no means follows, (where an attorney is the proper person to verify a complaint,) that, by a <em>vague and loose </em>statement, the opposite party may be called on to make a precise and explicit answer, <em>under oath; </em>or that, where a complaint is <em>clearly and definitely </em>verified, an attorney (being a proper person to verify the answer) can by a <em>general and indistinct </em>statement, deprive the plaintiff of his right to a full and explicit reply <em>on oath.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b318-10\">In this case the attorney has stated <em>some </em>grounds of his belief; but for <em>parts </em>of the complaint, (it <em>all </em>being on information, &amp;c.,) and those parts absolutely essential to the plaintiff\u2019s right of action, be does not profess to give <em>any </em>grounds of his belief; not even the information of his own client. I think his verification insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-11\">The defendant\u2019s answer is also verified by the attorney; and his verification, too, is bad, for not giving the <em>grounds of his belief, </em>the answer being on information, &amp;c. Still, as the complaint is not duly verified, the answer may stand as an answer in the cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-12\">Costs of motion to plaintiff on other points.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
