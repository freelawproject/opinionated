B. Olin, <em>for plaintiff.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b193-15\">W. A.

N. S. </em>351.) That was an action for <em>assault and battery; </em>coming fully within the case <em>(in </em>17 <em>Johnson, </em>111,) in which the plaintiff was said to be <em>the best judge of the injury </em>he had sustained, and so should be confined to it: and <em>the amendment was denied. </em>And, with all deference to the decision in <em>Corning </em>agt. <em>Corning, </em>that conclusion will, on examination of the cases there referred to, (7 <em>Cow. </em>517; 1 <em>Wend. </em>72; 3 <em>Wend. </em>356,) be found <em>not </em>to be <em>\u201c </em>virtually overruled \u201d in those cases. On referring to the two (of those three) cases that can be said to be analogous to the present case, (7 <em>Cow. </em>517, <em>and </em>3 <em>Wend. </em>356,) it will be seen that the ground stated as the <em>criterion, </em>by which to decide the justness of granting the amendment,\u2014(and the amendment <em>was allowed </em>in both cases)\u2014is very similar to that fixed by \u00a7 169 of the Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">In <em>Hoffnagle </em>agt. <em>Leavitt, </em>(7 <em>Cowen, </em>517,) it is said of the amendment, \u201cit <em>should be </em>granted; but that must be <em>without prejudice to the defendant. </em>He and his counsel were, in fact, <em>misled, </em>so <em>as not fully to prepare the </em>defenceAnd the only terms there imposed were consenting to a new trial in thirty days; without paying any costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">In <em>Box </em>agt. <em>Dey, </em>(3 <em>Wend. </em>356,362,) the verdict was founded on the <em>value of wheat on a particular day; </em>and there, (in <em>granting </em>the amendment <em>on payment of costs of the trial and </em>motion, <em>and consenting to a new trial,) </em>the court give this reason: \u201c such an amendment would be improper, <em>without giving the defendant an opportunity of reducing the damages\u00a1 which on the trial he had no occasion to do} by reason of the moderate amount claimed in the declaration.^</em></p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>In this case there is no pretence that the defendant, or his counsel, were misled. The suit was for professional services, by an attorney, and the items were principally made up of bills of costs in various suits. \u25a0 On the trial <em>every item of every bill </em>was, in fact, <em>contestedj </em>the defence was probably as fully prepared as it could ever be : and every attempt made to <em>reduce the </em>amount,\u2014that being, indeed, the main effort of the defence. It thus seems to me to come very clearly within the principle both of the Code and of the prior decisions as above quoted. More especially will it be seen to do so, when it is further taken into consideration that <em>very nearly one half o\u00ed </em>the amount reported due, consists of the <em>interest; </em>and that that interest <em>has chiefly accrued since the suit was commenced.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">I shall allow the amendment asked, on plaintiff\u2019s paying to defendant <em>$10 </em>costs of this motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">The other objects of the motion, in all the cases, I will not now pass upon ; as I presume that, the main question having been disposed of, the parties will have lit tie'difficulty in agreeing on at least the greater part of the details. Should they not, the plaintiffs have (or plaintiff has) leave to move those matters again, on the same papers, or such others as he or they may be advised.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">Unanimously affirmed, on appeal, at Albany general term, May, 1857, before Justices William B. Wright, Harris and Gould.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
