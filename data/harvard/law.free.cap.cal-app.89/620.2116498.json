The court sustained defendant\u2019s general demurrer to the complaint, and upon plaintiff\u2019s refusal to amend, judgment was entered for defendant, and plaintiff brings this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">Appellant states that the sole question raised is whether escrow instructions set forth in the pleadings constitute a contract upon the breach of which an action for damages can be maintained.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-8\">We deprecate long quotations, but it here seems necessary to set forth the escrow instructions. The essential portions of appellant\u2019s instructions are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-9\">\u201cESCROW INSTRUCTIONS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-10\">Order No. 697302.

A.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b651-12\">Respondent contends that in appellant\u2019s instructions no reference is made to respondent, only to the property. That there is no instruction to purchase or obtain title from respondent, only to use the $2,500 when the escrow-holder can issue its certificate to the title to lots 13 and 14, <em>non constat </em>but what this title might have passed from respondent and changed hands several times, so that if the title had finally been certified to appellant, the respondent might never have appeared in the transaction, except as his name was reported in the chain of title.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-13\">Respondent then proceeds in a logical manner to argue that there was no mutuality, no meeting of minds of appellant and respondent, and no acceptance, and cites numerous authorities, including to the same effect <em>Lambert </em>v. <em>Gerner, </em>142 Cal. 400 [76 Pac. 53], in which case, at page 403 [76 Pac. 54], the court says: \u201cBut appellant fails to make it clear as to where the acceptance is to be found. His argument seems to be \u2018That all the papers are to be taken together\u2019 to show this acceptance. An acceptance, in order to make the contract complete, must be unconditional; there must be an acceptance of the <em>offer as </em>made,\u201d\u2014 and that even assuming that plaintiff\u2019s instructions may be construed as an offer, nevertheless these instructions and the defendant\u2019s instructions are unrelated individual instruc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>tions conferring authority upon the title company to proceed in the particular manner indicated, but without conferring upon it any other or additional agency or authority. Conceding for the sake of argument that respondent\u2019s position and the decision of the trial court in sustaining the demurrer on these grounds was justified by the authorities cited by respondent at that time, the supreme court has held in <em>Tuso </em>v. <em>Green, </em>194 Cal. 574 [229 Pac. 327] :</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">\u201cIn construing such a contract the separately executed instruments are to be considered together as one contract. ... In such situation the mutual stipulations of the parties, the actual conveyance in escrow by one and the promise by the other to pay the price, both being valid, constituted a sufficient consideration and created a valid escrow.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">The facts in the above case were similar to those in the case at bar, and this authority together with the later cases of <em>Neher </em>v. <em>Kauffman, </em>197 Cal. 674 [242 Pac. 713, and <em>Thoroman </em>v. <em>David, </em>199 Cal. 386 [249 Pac. 513], establishes the contrary principle to that contended for by respondent, viz., the principle that the separately executed escrow instructions are to be considered and construed together and not as \u201cunrelated, individual instructions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">In <em>Neher </em>v. <em>Kauffman, supra, </em>the court says: \u201cThese instructions having been signed on the same day and as a part of the same transaction are to be read and considered together. When so read and considered, if they contain all the necessary constituent elements to make a contract they are to be regarded as a contract in writing between the parties.\u201d (Citing <em>Tuso </em>v. <em>Green, supra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b652-8\">In the ease at bar the instructions were signed on the same day and were part of the same transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-9\">Respondent contends that the consent of the parties was not mutual because they did not agree upon the same thing in the same sense (Civ. Code, secs. 1565, 1580), and in support of this contention argues that plaintiff could have withdrawn his money before the performance of the conditions set forth in his (plaintiff\u2019s) instructions to the title company.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-10\">Again, conceding that the authorities cited by respondent and presumably relied upon by the trial court may have seemed to them to justify this argument at the time, the same is entirely negatived by the eases last cited above. As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>an incident to this argument as to lack of mutuality respondent contends that no consideration passed to him from the title company compelling him to continue the agency for any length of time, but in <em>Tuso </em>v. <em>Green, supra, </em>the court held that \u201cthe mutual stipulations of the parties, the actual conveyance in escrow by one and the promise by the other to pay the price, both being valid, constituted a sufficient consideration.\u201d Applying the above principles to the escrow instructions in the case at bar, it is apparent that there was a contract in writing and the complaint so alleging, and alleging a breach thereof by defendant, it is stated a cause of action, and the demurrer should have been overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-3\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-4\">Craig, Acting P. J., and Thompson, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
