The books are overflowing with discussion relating to the general question presented, and it would seem to be well settled in principle that any legislative enactment which is designed to operate upon a particular class which in its specification presents a genuine or constitutional differentiation from other classes, either individual, or considered as a whole, is without the purpose and intent of the constitutional inhibition as contained within the provisions of the constitution to which reference has been had.  It is also thoroughly established that if such a law addressed to a particular class bears equally upon each person so classified, it cannot be said to be lacking in uniformity of operation. (5 Cal. Jur, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>823, and authorities there cited.) If, then, applying such principles to the instant case, and without doing violence to judicial or statutory requirements, it may be determined that itinerant vendors of drugs, nostrums, and ointments may be resolved into a class, and that the statute here involved places no greater or different burden upon one member of such class than it places upon any other member thereof, it would result that the point made by petitioner is unavailing to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">The ease entitled <em>In re Gilstrap, </em>171 Cal. 108 [Ann. Cas. 1917A, 1086, 152 Pac. 42], in various ways involved the constitutionality of the statute here under consideration. In substance, relying upon numerous authorities therein cited, it is there held that the definition of an itinerant vendor as found in section 3 of the act is broad enough to include hawkers and peddlers; that from early times persons so occupied have been deemed a proper subject for special legislative control and restriction, and that there is no doubt \u201cthat hawkers and peddlers may be placed in a class by themselves for license purposes.\u201d It is also therein held that the act in question \u201cis a general law, enforceable in every part of the state, regulating \u2018the business of selling or in any manner disposing of drugs, . . . within this state, \u2019 by itinerant vendors, as that term is defined in section 3 of the act, . . . <em>The law applies uniformly upon the whole \\of a single class of clearly defined individuals, and the classification is founded upon a natural, intrinsic and constitutional distinction.\u201d </em>(Citing authorities.)</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">On the part of petitioner no contention is made that, assuming the constitutionality of the statute so far as the classification of itinerant vendors of drugs is concerned, the legislature was without power to regulate the procedure with reference to violations of the provisions of the law. So far as this proceeding is concerned, therefore, the fact that, considered from the ordinary standpoint, the complaint filed in the municipal court against the defendant was possibly defective in that it failed to specifically allege that he had no license to sell drugs, nostrums, ointments, etc., becomes of no importance. The complaint, however, does contain the allegation that defendant sold the specified articles of merchandise \u201ccontrary to the provisions of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>act entitled \u2018An act imposing a license tax upon itinerant vendors of drugs, nostrums, ointments, or appliances sold for the cure of disease, injuries, or deformities, \u2019 approved March 19, 1903, and amendments thereto.\u201d While such manner of pleading is not to be commended for its directness or certainty, it is not impossible that the defendant was thereby sufficiently informed of the charge which was preferred against him, which, after all, is all that the law requires, and consequently constitutes everything to which the defendant was legally entitled.  Relying upon the principles of law as announced in the authorities to which attention has been directed, it must be concluded that the objection of petitioner to the legislation in question is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">The constitutionality of the act is also challenged by petitioner for the alleged reason that the portion of the act under which the defendant was charged is not embraced within the title of the act. (Art. IV, sec. 24, Const.) The specific claim of petitioner is that by the wording of the title to the act its provisions are limited to <em>itinerant vendors </em>and that the definition of the term does not include persons engaged, as was defendant, in \u201charanguing the people on public streets and in public places, and by using various customafy tricks . . . for attracting crowds,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">The title of the act is as follows: \u201cAn act imposing a license tax upon itinerant vendors of drugs, nostrums, ointments, or appliances sold for the cure of disease, injuries, or deformities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">By section 3 of the act the term \u201citinerant vendors\u201d is defined as follows: \u201cItinerant vendors under the meaning of this act shall include all persons who carry on the business above described by passing from house to house, or by haranguing the people on public streets or in public places, or use the various customary devices for attracting crowds and therewith recommending their wares, and offering them for sale.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">While it is possible that in accordance with a strict interpretation of the word \u201citinerant,\u201d the business conducted by defendant could not be so classified, it should be remembered that it is unnecessary that the body of an act should adhere literally to its title. <em>(Abeel </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>84 Cal. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>226 [24 Pac. 383]; <em>Ex parte Liddell, </em>93 Cal. 633 [29 Pac. 251]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>100 Cal. 105 [34 Pac. 492]; <em>Hellman </em>v. <em>Shoulters, </em>114 Cal. 136 [44 Pac. 915, 45 Pac. 1057]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Linda Vista Irr. Dist., </em>128 Cal. 477 [61 Pac. 86]; <em>Ex parte Hallawell, </em>155 Cal. 112 [99 Pac. 490]; <em>Park </em>v. <em>Pacific Fire Extinguisher Co., </em>37 Cal. App. 112 [173 Pac. 615].) In that regard, if it appears that the title of the act is reasonably indicative of the legislation contained within the provisions of the statute, the objection that the subject of the act is not expressed in its title cannot be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">In the case entitled <em>Ex parte Liddell, </em>93 Cal. 633, 637 [29 Pac. 251], it is said: \u201cIf the title contains a reasonable intimation of the matters under legislative consideration, the public cannot complain. It has always been the custom' to state the subject of a bill in general terms and with the fewest words, and the framers of the constitution donbtless intended the legislature to conform to that custom. \u2019 \u2019 And in <em>Abeel </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>84 Cal. 226, 229 [24 Pac. 383], it is ruled that \u201cit is not necessary that the title of an act should embrace an abstract or catalogue of its contents.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">\u201c . . . The main object of this provision (of the constitution) is to prevent legislators and the public from being entrapped by misleading titles to bills whereby legislation relating to one subject might be obtained under the title of another. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">In the case of <em>People </em>v. <em>Jordan, </em>172 Cal. 391, 394 [156 Pac. 451], it is said: \u201c . . . Where the body of an act embraces provisions which are <em>germane to the general subject </em>stated in its title, the title will be held sufficient to comprehend all of the provisions of the act itself; and where the title <em>suggests to the mind the field of legislation </em>which the text of the act includes, the title will not be held misleading or insufficient, or the act restricted in its operation. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">It therefore becomes manifest that, aside from the definition contained within the statute of the term \u201citinerant vendors,\u201d with which the accusation against the defendant accurately coincides, the title of the act being in nowise misleading as to what reasonably might be expected to be embraced within the statute, but, to the contrary, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>being plainly indicative thereof, is not in conflict with the provision of the constitution upon which petitioner relies.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-3\">It is ordered that the writ be and it is discharged, and that petitioner be and he is remanded to the custody of the marshal of the municipal court of the city of Los Angeles.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">Conrey, P. J., and York, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
