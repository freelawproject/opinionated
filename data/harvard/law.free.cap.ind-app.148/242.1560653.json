Certainly there are all of the persuasive reasons for specifying the grounds of summary judgment that we would find on the ruling for a motion for new trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-6\">\u201cIn the case before us this Court or the Appellate Court is entitled to have the court below set out the reason for the granting of the motion for summary j udgment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-7\">\u201cThis cause is reversed with instructions to the court to reconsider the motion for summary judgment in the light of this opinion and to rule on said motion for summary judgment consistent with this opinion, and to state with particularity the reasons for granting any summary judgment. Prior opinions of this Court which are inconsistent with the holdings stated herein, are hereby overruled.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b273-8\"><em>Harris </em>was followed by this court in <em>Singh </em>v. <em>Interstate Finance of Indiana </em>(1969), 144 Ind. App. 444, 246 N. E. 2d 776, 17 Ind. Dec. 323.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-9\">In view of this error, it is not necessary for us to consider the other errors assigned by appellants.'</p>\n<p id=\"b273-10\">This cause is, therefore, remanded with instructions to the court to reconsider the motion for summary judgment in light of this opinion and the opinion of our Supreme Court in <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Young Women\u2019s Christian Association, supra, </em>to rule on said motion for summary judgment consistent with this opinion, and to state with <em>particularity </em>the reasons for granting any summary judgment. We shall retain jurisdiction of this appeal for determination upon the merit's at such time as the supporting statement of the trial judge is certified to this court. Such procedure is countenanced and promoted by Rule AP. 15 (M) (6), Indiana Rules of Procedure, and prior to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>effective date of such rule we took analogous action in <em>State Bd. of Tax Com'rs. </em>v. <em>Fort Wayne Sport Club, Inc. </em>(1969), 145 Ind.
