In October, 1896, she gave notice of withdrawal for the stock in the sixty-fourth series; on February 15, 1897, the board of directors declared the stock in the forty-sixth series matured; and on June 22, 1897, she assigned and delivered all of her stock to the association, which was canceled, and in payment therefor was given a check for $717.70 on the American Exchange National Bank of Chicago. On July-27, 1897, Jacob Ruble and others filed a bill in the Circuit Court of Cook County against this association, alleging acts of mismanagement on the part of its officers, praying for an investigation, a receiver, etc. On July 31st, four days afterward, the State Auditor appointed a custodian for the association, who immediately took possession of its assets and withdrew the money on deposit, over $4,000, out of the bank. On August 7th appellant\u2019s check was presented for payment at the American Exchange National Bank, but payment was refused because no funds of the drawer were then on deposit. On August 13th, the people, on the relation of the State Auditor, filed a bill in the Circuit Court of Cook County against the association, whereupon three receivers were appointed, and upon the order of the court the money in the hands of the custodian was paid over to the receivers. Having given notice to all parties in the suit and having obtained permission of the court, appellant filed an intervening petition in the cause on August 30th, claiming that $717.70, then in the hands of the receivers, was her property and rightfully belonged to her by reason of the prior assignment thereof by the association, as evidenced by the check, and asking that the receivers be ordered to pay it over to her. The receivers answered that the check was given for stock canceled; that at the time the notice of withdrawal was given, and at the time part of the stock was declared matured, the association was insolvent; that petitioner was not paid in the order of giving withdrawal notice, and that therefore she occupied the position of a stockholder, notwithstanding the giving of the check. The petitioner (appellant) filed exceptions to that part of the answer which alleged insolvency and\" also to that part which alleged that petitioner was not paid in order of giving withdrawal notice, claiming those matters to be immaterial and\u2019 impertinent. The court overruled the exceptions and petitioner filed a replication to said answer. The cause was referred to a master in chancery to take evidence and report with conclusions, upon the issues raised. On July 12,1898, the cause came on to be heard by the court upon the master\u2019s report and the exceptions of petitioner thereto, and the court found that petitioner continued to be a stockholder, notwithstanding the giving of the check and the surrender and cancellation of her stock; and that she was only entitled to her pro rata share of the assets of the association. From this decree the appeal here is prosecuted.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b212-4\" pgmap=\"212\">Nobmait H.

'In this case, the money having been withdrawn from the bank and become a, part of the assets of the association prior to the presentation of the check, there was no specific fund upon which the check could' operate, and it amouhted to nothing more than a check by the association upon itself, which would not assign to the holder of the check any portion of the assets of the association.

A member who has given notice of withdrawal from such an association, can not, if the association is found to have been insolvent when the notice was given, be permitted to receive any more than his just proportion of assets, and must share losses with other shareholders. Gibson v. Safety L. &amp; H. Ass\u2019n, 170 Ill. 44; Chapman v. Young, 65 Ill. App. 131; Canadian Bldg. Ass\u2019n v. Quimby, 79 Ill. App. 105.</p> <p id=\"A0U\" pgmap=\"217\">It is, however, questioned in the arguments of counsel, whether the evidence here warrants a conclusion that this association was insolvent in October, 1896, when the withdrawal notice was given by appellant.</p> <p id=\"A5Y\" pgmap=\"217(224) 218(68)\">This appeal lies from a decree upon an intervening petition. A decree entered in the cause in which this petition was filed upon December 22, 1897, finds that on July 1, 1897, the association was insolvent, and that its liabilities exceeded its assets by the sum of $284,000. Upon the hearing of the issues raised by this petition, evidence was produced to show that the association was also insolvent in October, 1896. E. A. Gore testified that he was experienced in examining into the condition of building and loan associations; that he had examined the condition of this association; that there were other withdrawal notices given prior to that of appellant; that one of such withdrawing shareholders had not been paid when it was sought to pay appellant; that he ascertained the true condition of the association on September 20, 1897; that it was insolvent at that date and also on June 22,1897, and that the deficit at such times amounted to $284,000; that in October, 1896, the association was insolvent, and that its condition was then better only to the extent of $40,000 than in September, 1897. This witness stated that in forming his opinion he had considered the cost of the real estate owned by the association, and also reports of expert appraisers. The witness was not wholly consistent as to his knowledge of real estate values. At one time he testified that he was not \u201c a real estate man,\u201d and was ignorant of real estate values. At another time, later in his examination, he testified that he could very closely determine the value of such property by knowledge of its location, which is substantially all that a real estate expert can do.</p> <p id=\"b218-5\" pgmap=\"218\">Against- this testimony, unsatisfactory as it is, nothing whatever was offered. It appeared by the decree that the association was largely insolvent in July, 1897, and it appeared from the testimony that its condition was not better, except to the extent of $40,000, in October, 1896.</p> <p id=\"b218-6\" pgmap=\"218\">We think it clearly determinable from all the evidence, that the association was insolvent to the extent of a deficit of at least $244,000 in October, 1896, when appellant\u2019s notice of withdrawal was given,and in February, 1897, when the stock of the forty-sixth series was declared matured.</p> <p id=\"b218-7\" pgmap=\"218\">It is claimed that payment here has been fully made by the giving of the check, and that such payment controls. We think not. Whatever might be said of the right of appellant ordinarily, as against the drawer of the check, to the fund upon which it was drawn, yet it remains a fact that the check, given on account of a supposed obligation, which obligation did not equitably exist, was not presented while funds were in bank, and has not yet been paid, nor has the supposed obligation been satisfied. In this suit upon the intervening petition here, such payment of the supposed'obligation is, in effect, sought to be enforced.</p> <p id=\"b218-8\" pgmap=\"218\">In Chapman v. Young, supra, it was held that although the shareholder seeking to withdraw had obtained judgment against the association, yet upon it being determined that the association was insolvent when his withdrawal notice was given, the collection of such judgment would be controlled by a court of equity, and that the character of his claim was not altered by the fact of obtaining judgment.</p> <p id=\"b218-9\" pgmap=\"218(32) 219(108)\">In this case, in view of the insolvency of the association when the notice of withdrawal was given, and when the check was drawn, we hold that a payment should not in equity be permitted. Having reached this conclusion, we find it unnecessary to consider other questions raised, except one, viz., as to the fees of the master in chancery. It is claimed by the appellant that the fees of the master in chancery are too large, and that the court below has failed to pass upon the propriety of them. We are unable, from this record, to determine whether they are proper. The decision here, affirming the decree, is made without prejudice to the rights of appellant to have a motion to fix the amount of the master\u2019s fees hereafter considered by the trial court. The decree is affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
