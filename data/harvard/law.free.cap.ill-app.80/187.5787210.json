IS. If any person or persons being or pretending to be, an officer or agent, or board of directors, of any stock corporation, or pretended stock corporation, shall assume to exercise corporate powers, or use the name of any such corporation, or pretended corporation, without complying with the provisions of this act (or) before all stock named in the articles of incorporation shall be subscribed in good faith, then they shall be jointly and severally liable for all debts and liabilities made by them, and contracted in the name of such corporation or pretended corporation.\u201d 1 Starr &amp; Curtis\u2019 Ann. Ill. Stat. (2d Ed.), 1009, Ch. 32, Sec. 18.</p><p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b194-8\" pgmap=\"194\">This provision remained dormant and practically meaningless to the profession for nearly twenty years after the passage of the act, and until this court in Loverin v. McLaughlin, 46 Ill. App. 373, and later the Supreme Court, in affirming the same case, 161 Ill. 417, by interpolating the word \u201c or\u201d between the words \u201cact\u201d and \u201c before\u201d in the sixth line of the section, gave to it a somewhat startling scope and significance, holding that the omission to file the certificate of complete organization of a corporation created under the general act, in the office of the recorder of deeds of the county in which the principal office of the company -was located, as required by section 4 of the act, rendered the directors of the company personally liable for debts made by them, and contracted in the name of the corporation.</p><p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b194-9\" pgmap=\"194(29) 195(133)\">This result was arrived at, in part, by construing section 4 of the act, (which provides, among other things, that upon the recording of the certificate of complete organization, including as a part thereof a copy of all papers filed in the office of the Secretary of State in and about the organization of the corporation, in the office of the recorder of deeds, the corporation shall be deemed fully organized and may proceed to business,) to mean that the corporation is not fully organized, and to prohibit the exercise of corporate powers until after such recording of the certificate, in accordance with the principle of statutory construction that \u201ca provision that certain things shall be done, to constitute a license or authority, is equivalent to an express prohibition against the license or authority unless those things shall be done,\u201d and other rules of constructi\u00f3n applied in Diversey v. Smith, 103 Ill. 378, and Loverin v. McLaughlin, 161 Ill. 417.</p><p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b195-4\" pgmap=\"195\">So far as the language of the opinion in the Loverin case (161 Ill. 417) is pertinent to the subject of participation, it fortifies our eontention. In construing section 18 of the act Mr. J ustice Magruder, speaking for the court, says :</p><p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b195-5\" pgmap=\"195\">\u201c That section provides that the officers or directors \u2018shall be jointly and severally liable for all debts and liabilities made by them and contracted in the name of such corporation or pretended corporation.\u2019 This language presupposes a contract between the creditors and the directors or officers in the name of the corporation. A contract must be between two parties.\u201d 161 Ill. 434.</p><p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b195-6\" pgmap=\"195\">The obvious scope and meaning of the words \u201c made by themas employed in reference to directors, officers or agents, and the debts, liability for which is imposed by the section, require that a director or officer should have taken some active part in contracting the debt with which he is sought to be charged under the section. This view is strongly supported by the analogy of cases arising under section 16 of the act, which provides that \u201c if the indebtedness of any stock corporation shall exceed the amount of its capital stock, the directors and officers of such corporation assenting thereto shall be personally and individually liable for such excess to the creditors of such corporation.\u201d 1 Starr &amp; Curtis\u2019 Ann. Ill. Stat. (2d Ed.), 1007, Ch. 32, Sec. 16.</p><p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b195-7\" pgmap=\"195\">It is true the nature of the liability imposed by the latter section is essentially different from that provided by section 18.</p><p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b196-4\" pgmap=\"196\">While the language of section 18 presupposes a contract between the creditor and directors or officers of the corporation, and there can manifestly be no liability under the section in the absence of a contract, nevertheless the liability is not contractual, but penal. \u201c The creditor\u2019s right of recovery is totally unaffected by any actual loss or injury he may have sustained by the failure or neglect of the officers or directors.\u201d The fact that the company itself is solvent and abundantly able to pay the debt, does not absolve the directors or officers who made the debt from liabilit under the section, the object of which is to inflict a punishment for its violation. The liability being penal it is enforceable, therefore, only at law, as equity does not enforce penalties. Loverin v. McLaughlin, 161 Ill. 417; Curtis v. Tracy, 169 Ill. 233.</p><p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b196-5\" pgmap=\"196\">On the other hand, section 16, while not rendering the contracting of debts in excess of the capital stock of a corporation unlawful, makes the directors assenting to such excess personally and individually liable therefor to the creditors of the company. The liability is contractual, not penal, and is, like that of a surety, stricti juris, and does not attach so long as the debt can be made out of the company. The liability is not imposed in favor of some particular creditor, but in favor of all the creditors of the company as a body, and it is enforceable only in a court of equity. Woolverton v. Taylor, 132 Ill. 197; Lewis v. Montgomery, 145 Ill. 30; Horner v. Henning, 93 U. S. 228.</p><p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b196-6\" pgmap=\"196\">However, the rules of construction applicable to the words \u201c assenting thereto,\u201d in the 16th section, and the words \u201c.made by them,\u201d in the 18th section, as well as the meaning of the two phrases, are essentially the same.</p><p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b196-7\" pgmap=\"196(71) 197(18)\">The liability under the former section is stricti j'uris, &amp;nd under the latter it is penal. In either case the statute is to be strictly construed against those seeking to enforce the liability. The words employed should be interpreted according to their plain and obvious meaning, and should not be-extended by construction so as to embrace cases not clearly within the terms of the statute. Lewis v. Montgomery, 145 Ill. 30; 3 Thompson\u2019s Com. on Law of Corp., Sec. 4164; Rorke v. Thomas, 56 N. Y. 559.</p><p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b197-4\" pgmap=\"197\">In other States, where statutes containing provisions of this character, which impose personal liability on directors for corporate debts, for failing to make reports, or for making false reports, etc., such as the provisions of the Hew York manufacturing companies act, have been frequently made the subjects of judicial construction, they are regarded as giving creditors cumulative remedies for the collection of corporate debts, and not in any sense as imposing on directors or officers a punishment for an offense against the State, although they are treated as penal in character, in that they tend to conflict with the general policy ,of acts providing for the formation of corporations, which is, \u201c immunity from personal liability, and also because they subject directors to a burdensome liability,\u201d and they are, therefore, strictly construed in all courts.

Edwards, as directors of the Thompson &amp; Edwards Fertilizer Company, charging them, as such directors, with a violation of section 18 of the general law for the incorporation of private corporations, in - exercising corporate powers and using the name of said corporation without complying with the provisions of the law. The jury found the issues for appellee and assessed her damages at the sum of $311.95, and judgment was rendered on the verdict against all the defendants. From this judgment Hoyt and Edwards appealed. Ffo question is raised as to the sufficiency of the pleadings.</p><p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b201-4\" pgmap=\"201\">The facts are substantially as follows: The certificate of the complete organization of the \u201c Thompson &amp; Edwards Fertilizer Company \u201d was issued by the Secretary of State, January 15, 1886. It appears from its articles of incorporation that its object was \u201c The manufacture and sale of commercial fertilizers;\u201d that its capital stock was $100,000, the number of its shares of stock 1,000 of $100 each, and the location of its principal office, the Union Stock Yards, in Chicago, Cook county, Illinois. A copy of its certificate of complete organization was not filed for record in the office of the recorder of deeds of Cook county, as required by section 4 of the statute. The company became indebted to appellee in the year 1894 and prior years in a considerable amount. The indebtedness consisted partly of money loaned by appellee to the company and partly of wages earned by her husband and two of her sons working for the company, which wages were, by the consent of her husband and sons, credited to her on the company\u2019s books, and receipted for to her by the company as cash. The last cash credit to her account on the books of the company is of date December 23, 1894, and it is not claimed that after that date she advanced any money to the company, or that she was entitled to any credit for the wages of her husband or sons. Appellant Edwards was one of the original directors, and appellant Hoyt first became a stockholder in May, 1895, and first became a director June 18,1895.</p><p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b201-5\" pgmap=\"201(11) 202(85)\">January 14, 1897, at a meeting of the board of directors, A.

February 27,1897, at a meeting of the board of directors, Hoyt, Martin, Edwards, Hasse and Barnard being present, the minutes of the meeting of Jan-nary 14, 1897, were read and approved; also article 12 of the by-laws of the company was so amended as to read as follows:</p><p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b202-6\" pgmap=\"202\">\u201c The president, vice-president and secretary and treasurer (one person) shall jointly be empowered to buy, sell, mortgage, or lease any real estate and execute deeds therefor.

If any person or persons, being, or pretending to be, an officer or agent, or board of directors, of any stock corporation, or pretended stock corporation, shall assume to exercise corporate powers, or use the name of any such corporation, or pretended corporation, without complying with the provisions of this act, before all stock named in the articles of incorporation shall be subscribed in good faith, then they shall be jointly and severally liable for all debts and liabilities made by them, and contracted in the name of such corporation, or pretended corporation.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b203-7\" pgmap=\"203\">As construed by the court in Loverin v. McLaughlin, 161 Ill. 417, the section must be read as if the word \u201cor\u201d occurred next after the word \u201c act \u201d in the section.</p> <p id=\"b203-8\" pgmap=\"203\">The indebtedness of the company to appellee for cash advanced by her, and the wages earned by her husband and sons and credited to her as cash, having been incurred before appellant Hoyt became a director of the company, he can not be held liable as a director for that indebtedness. That indebtedness or liability can not be said to have been made by him, and to hold him under the statute he must have participated, at least, in the making of the debt or liability. Lewis et al. v. Montgomery et al., 145 Ill. 30.</p> <p id=\"b203-9\" pgmap=\"203(86) 204(74)\">Appellee\u2019s counsel admit the correctness of this proposition, sajnng: \u201c Appellee does not insist that section 18 of the act concerning corporations renders directors liable for debts contracted by their predecessors in office.\u201d The contention of appellee\u2019s counsel is, that the note was given and received in payment of the prior indebtedness of the company to appellee; that such being the case, a new liability on the part of the company was created, and that article 12 of the by-laws, as amended February 27, 1897, authorized the creation of this new liability, in the manner stated. Whether the first proposition is true,, is a question of fact; each of the second and third propositions involves merely a question of law. The question of fact, namely, whether the note was given and received in payment, was a question for the determination of the jury. Belleville Savings Bank v. Bornman et al., 124 Ill. 200, 207, and cases there cited.</p> <p id=\"b204-6\" pgmap=\"204\">Appellee\u2019s counsel, in their argument, concede this proposition. But the court excluded this question from the jury, as will clearly appear when we come to consider the instructions. This being true, the judgment can not be sustained on the theory of appellee\u2019s counsel, based, as it is, on the proposition that there was an agreement that the note should operate as payment. But we can not accede to the proposition that article 12 of the by-laws, as amended February 27, 1897, authorized or contemplated the making an agreement that a note executed to a creditor of the company should operate as payment of the indebtedness evidenced by the note. The part of article 12 relied on as being such authority is as follows:</p> <p id=\"b204-7\" pgmap=\"204\">\u201c The secretary and treasurer shall be empowered to sign and indorse notes, checks and drafts necessary for the ordinary business of the company; but all such notes, checks and drafts must be countersigned by the general manager.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b204-8\" pgmap=\"204\">There is no evidence that it was necessary, in the ordinary business of the company, to agree that its notes, executed in consideration of indebtedness previously incurred, should be accepted by its creditors in payment of such indebtedness, and it is matter of common knowledge that this is not necessary in the ordinary course of the business of corporations, and that, on the contrary, it is exceptional and unusual.</p> <p id=\"b204-9\" pgmap=\"204(51) 205(143)\">It is unnecessary to the decision of the present case to decide the question whether, if the note' was given and received in payment of the prior indebtedness of the company to appellee, a new indebtedness or liability, within the meaning of the statute, was thereby created, and on that question the court expresses no opinion. The writer, however, is of the opinion that in such case there would be no new liability, within the meaning of the statute. Appellee\u2019s counsel contend that appellants are liable as partners, and have discussed that question at considerable length. But even though it should be conceded, as matter of law, that they could be so held, the contention can not prevail, because the evidence shows, without contradiction, that appellant Hoyt did not become a stockholder till May, 1895, or a director till June 18,1895. The indebtedness to appellee was incurred prior to the year 1895, and it is well settled that a partner in a copartnership firm is not liable for debts incurred by the firm previous to his having become a partner. Story on Partnership (7th Ed.), Sec. 146, et sequentes, and notes.</p> <p id=\"b205-4\" pgmap=\"205\">The judgment being a unit, if erroneous as to Hoyt is also erroneous as to Edwards. St. R. R. Co. v. Morrison, etc., Co., 160 Ill. 288, 295, and cases cited; Finance Co., etc., v. Hanlon, 75 Ill. App. 188.</p> <p id=\"b205-5\" pgmap=\"205\">The court gave to the jury, at the request of appellee\u2019s counsel, the following instructions:</p> <p id=\"b205-6\" pgmap=\"205\">1. \u201c The jury are instructed, as a matter of law, that if they find from the evidence that the document known as the final certificate of Incorporation, commonly called a charter, offered in evidence, was issued by the Secretary of the State of Illinois, for a proposed corporation entitled\" the \u2018Thompson &amp; Edwards Fertilizer Company,\u2019 and that said charter recites that the principal office of said corporation was to be located in the city of Chicago, in the county of Cook and State of Illinois, and that such final certificate, or charter, was never recorded in the office of the recorder of deeds of said Cook county;</p> <p id=\"b205-8\" pgmap=\"205(87) 206(69)\">\u201c And, if the jury further find from the records of said alleged corporation, and from the evidence in the case, that the defendants Henry W. Hoyt and Henry J. Edwards were, with other persons, directors of said alleged corporation at the time that' Frank E. Barnard, acting as the secretary and treasurer of said alleged corporation, and A. L. Mestierode, acting as the general manager of said alleged corporation, said Barnard and Hestlerode being authorized to so act by the records of said alleged corporation, when they so executed, in the name of said corporation, the note sued upon in this case, then, if the jury so find from the evidence, they will find the issues for the plaintiff, and such sum as they find from the evidence is due and unpaid upon the note offered in evidence, together with interest at the rate of six per cent per annum, after maturity.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b206-4\" pgmap=\"206\">2. \u201c The court instructs the jury that, if they find from the evidence that at the time when the note was given, it was given in settlement of a book account of the Thompson &amp; Edwards Fertilizer Company, with the-plaintiff, such fact' will not impeach the consideration of said note; but, if the jury further find, that the note was issued in the ordinary course of business of said corporation, and find from the evidence that the charter of said company has never been recorded in the record\u00e9r\u2019s office of Cook county; and, if the jury further find from the evidence, that at the time when said note was executed, the defendants Henry W. Hoyt and Henry J. Edwards were directors, then they will find against the defendants and in favor of the plaintiff.\u201d</p> <p id=\"AKk\" pgmap=\"206\">3. \u201cThe court instructs the jury that, if they find from the evidence that F. E. Barnard, as secretary and treasurer, and A. L. JSTestlerode, as general manager of the Thompson &amp; Edwards Fertilizer Company, were authorized by a resolution of that company to execute note of said company; and if the jury further find from the evidence that the charter of the Thompson &amp; Edwards Fertilizer Company was not at that time filed for record in the recorder\u2019s office of the county of Cook and State of Illinois, and, if the jury further find from the evidence that at the time said note was given, the defendants Henry W. Hoyt and Henry J. Edwards were, with others, directors of said company, then the jury are instructed to find for the plaintiff and assess the plaintiff\u2019s damages at the amount due upon said note, together with interest at six per cent after maturity.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b206-8\" pgmap=\"206(108) 207(89)\">4. \u201c The court instructs the jury, as a matter of law, that the Revised Statutes of the State of Illinois require that when any instrument in writing is recorded .in the recorder\u2019s office, the recorder shall indorse upon such instrument' a certificate of the time (including the hour of the day) when the same was filed for record (which shall be' considered the time of recording the same); and if the jury find from the evidence that the charter offered in evidence has not indorsed upon it such certificate, and, if the jury further find from the .evidence at the time when the note was given, it was given in settlement of a book account of the Thompson &amp; Edwards Fertilizer Company with the plaintiff, and that said note w;as issued in the ordinary course of business of said corporation, at the time it bears date, and the jury further find from the evidence that at the time said note was executed, the' defendants Henry W. Hoyt and Henry J. Edwards were directors of _ said corporation, then the jury will find the issues in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b207-4\" pgmap=\"207\">It is apparent, from inspection of these instructions, that the question whether the note was given and received in payment of the company\u2019s indebtedness to appellee was excluded from the consideration of the jury. By the first instruction the verdict is made to depend upon the non-recording of the final certificate in the office of the recorder of deeds of Cook county, and the fact that Barnard and Hestlerode were the acting and authorized secretary and treasurer and general manager of the company when they executed the note, and that appellants Hoyt and Edwards were, at said time, directors. The jury are instructed that, if they find these facts, they will find the issues for the plaintiff. This instruction plainly excludes from the jury\u2019s consideration all question as to whether there was an agreement that the note should operate as payment.</p> <p id=\"b207-5\" pgmap=\"207\">Instructions 2, 3 and 4, equally exclude that question from the jury, by authorizing a verdict on proof of other facts.</p> <p id=\"b207-6\" pgmap=\"207\">Instruction 2 authorizes a verdict for appellee, on a finding by the jury that the note was given in settlement of a book account of the company; that it was issued in the ordinary course of business of the company; that the charter has not been recorded, and that, when the note was executed, Hoyt and Edwards were directors.</p> <p id=\"b207-7\" pgmap=\"207\">The instruction assumes that if the note was executed in the ordinary course of business, even though it may have been so executed in consideration of prior indebtedness binding on the company, and without any agreement that it should operate as payment, its execution would be illegal, and if appellants were directors at the time of its execu-</p> <p id=\"AmF\" pgmap=\"208\">tion, the mere fact that they were such, without proof that either of them participated in any way in making or creating the indebtedness for which the note was given, would make them liable. Such is not the law. To execute a note for indebtedness previously incurred is not to make a debt or liability\u2019- within the meaning of section 18 of the statute. The language of the section is, \u201c then they shall be jointly and severally liable for all debts and liabilities made by them.\u201d Appellee\u2019s counsel contend that the section is purely remedial, and must be so construed, but the Supreme Court has held that section 16 of the act, which makes directors assenting to indebtedness of a corporation in excess of the amount of its capital stock liable for such excess, should be construed strictly (Lewis v. Montgomery, supra), and the Supreme Court of the United States, in Huntington v. Attsill, 146 U. S. 687, while holding a similar statute not strictly penal, say : \u201c As the statute imposes a burdensome liability on the officers for their Avrongful acts, it may well be considered penal in the sense that it should be strictly construed.\u201d Ib. 676. In the last case (p. 667), and also in Diversey v. Smith, 103 Ill. 378, 390, it is held that a penal law may also be remedial.</p> <p id=\"b208-6\" pgmap=\"208\">The reasoning by which the conclusion is reached that section 16 should be construed strictly, is equally applicable to section 18, and applying that construction to the latter section, \u201c The words employed should be interpreted according to their plain and obvious meaning, and should not be extended by construction so as to embrace cases not clearly Avithin the terms of the statute.\u201d Lewis v. Montgomery, supra. By the terms of the statute, liability is imposed on those only by whom the debts or liabilities Avere made.</p> <p id=\"b208-7\" pgmap=\"208(73) 209(53)\">We think it too clear to require argument, that the execution by a corporation of a promissory note, for indebtedness long previously incurred, is not the making of or incurring liability for the indebtedness evidenced by the note. The giving of the note is merely a recognition of the validity of the previously incurred indebtedness of the corporation, and a promise to do that Avhich the corporation is legally bound to do, viz., pay it. In Lewis v. Montgomery, supra, it was held, in respect to section 16, that to make the directors liable, it must appear that they assented to the creation of indebtedness in excess of the amount of the capital stock, and the court, after so holding, said:</p> <p id=\"b209-4\" pgmap=\"209\">\u201cManifestly, a recognition of the indebtedness bv the directors after it has been so contracted*as to become binding upon the corporation, should not have the effect of charging them with this statutory liability. After the indebtedness has been created by such agents and in such manner as to constitute it a valid obligation of the corporation, it becomes the duty of the directors to recognize its validity, and, so far as in'their power, provide for its payment.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b209-5\" pgmap=\"209\">This language is equally applicable to section 18. Instruction 2 is also erroneous in assuming that appellants would be liable for the wrongful act of another officer or agent of the corporation, solely on the ground that they were directors at the time the act was performed. This view is expressly repudiated in Lewis v. Montgomery, supra.</p> <p id=\"b209-6\" pgmap=\"209\">We can not approve of a single instruction given for the appellee, our opinion being that they are all erroneous. The only other instruction given was a modification of an instruction asked by appellant Edwards, and related solely to the necessity of proof of appellee\u2019s case by a preponderance of the evidence.</p> <p id=\"b209-7\" pgmap=\"209\">Counsel for appellant, at the close of the plaintiff\u2019s evidence, requested the court to instruct the jury to find the issues for the defendant Hoyt, and presented to the court a written instruction so directing the jury, which instruction the court refused to give. Appellant Hoyt asked for no other instruction. We are of opinion that the instruction asked by appellant Hoyt at the close of all the evidence should have been given.</p> <p id=\"b209-8\" pgmap=\"209\">The judgment will be reversed and the cause remanded.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
