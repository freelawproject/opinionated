Appellees claimed to be the owner of the piano. They had sold it to Eoberts about two and one-half years before, to be paid for in small payments, under a contract in which he agreed that the piano should remain the property of the appellees until paid for. The piano had remained in Eoberts\u2019 possession. He had paid $146 out of the purchase price of $365. It is now said to- be worth about $175 or $180. Testimony was admitted tending to show that Eoberts had stated to appellees, about a month before the distraint, that he would like to return the piano and cancel the contract, as he could not keep up the payments, owing to his wife\u2019s illness; but that he wished to retain the piano until he could take his wife away, and would notify appellees when he was going; that this was agreed to, a,nd it was understood the piano was to remain in Eoberts\u2019 possession two or three months longer. It does not appear, hoxvever, that the contract of sale to Eoberts was ever actually canceled.</p><attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b58-8\" pgmap=\"58\">Jones &amp; Strong, attorneys for appellant.</attorneys><attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b58-9\" pgmap=\"58\">John 0.

It provided that the \u201c instrument is and shall remain the property of the said Emerson Piano Co.\u201d until all the payments for it should be made; but it also provided that when they were made the \u201c full, absolute and complete title \u201d should vest in the purchaser. It contemplated immediate delivery of the piano to Boberts and allowed him its possession and use. It permitted appellees to \u201c retake possession \u201d or to enforce \u201c payment and collection \u201d of the amount of the purchase price at their option. The language of the contract indicates a sale and delivery of the piano, and although the parties agreed as between themselves that the title should remain in appellees, as to third parties without statutory or other notice it vested immediately in the purchaser. Blatchford v. Boyden, 122 Ill. 657, 668.</p> <p id=\"b59-6\" pgmap=\"59\">The statute provides that \u201c no mortgage, trust deed, or other conveyance of personal property, having the effect of a mortgage or lien upon such property, shall be valid as against the rights and interests of any third person unless * * * the instrument shall provide for the possession of the property to remain with the grantor, and the instrument is acknowledged and recorded as hereinafter directed, and every such instrument shall, for the purposes of this\" act, be deemed a chattel mortgage.\u201d Rev. Stat., Chap. 95, Sec. 1.</p> <p id=\"b59-9\" pgmap=\"59\">This contract must \u201c be deemed a chattel mortgage.\u201d It was not acknowledged and recorded, as required by the statute, and was invalid as against third parties.</p> <p id=\"b59-10\" pgmap=\"59(70) 60(154)\">It is urged, however, that whatever right or title Boberts had under the contract was released and canceled Bovember 9th prior to the distraint, and that \u201c the piano became the property of the appellees.\u201d There is testimony to the effect that Boberts expressed a desire that appellees should take the piano back and cancel the contract. The memorandum of Bovember 9th, entered on appellees\u2019 books, is as follows: \u201c Called and said could not make payment on account of sickness in family, and would like to keep piano. Arrangements made to leave piano for few months\u2014say about January 21, 1897.\u201d This does not show a cancellation of the contract, nor any surrender on the part of Roberts. There was here no \u201c legal sale and delivery \u201d to appellees as in Howdyshell v. Gary, 21 Ill. App. 288, 291, cited by appellees\u2019 counsel, and there was no change in the relation of the parties nor in the possession or title to the piano. The agreement to return it or to receive it back and cancel the contract, if so made, was still unexecuted. The provisions of Sec. 16, Chap. 80, Rev. Stat., providing that \u201c in no case shall the property of any other person,\u201d although found on the premises, be liable to seizure for rent, are not, therefore, applicable.</p> <p id=\"b60-5\" pgmap=\"60\">For the reasons indicated, the judgment of the County Court must be reversed and the cause remanded.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
