The question involved was whether the appellant was entitled, as purchaser at a sale by the assignee, of a certain account on which it was alleged there was a balance due the insolvent estate. The court found against the appellant. The question was mainly one of fact. The judgment was reversed and the cause remanded with directions.</p></opinion></casebody> </body></html>"}}
