D. 1893, the Illinois Central Railroad Company, as party of the first part, and the Yazoo and Mississippi Valley Railroad Company, as party of the second part, and the American Express Company, as party of the third part, among other things, agreed as follows:</p><p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b484-10\" pgmap=\"484\">\u25a0 \u2018 As one of the express conditions of this contract, the party of the third part hereby binds and obligates itself to save harmless and fully indemnify the parties of the first part and second parts and each of them, their respective officers and employes, from and against all actions and liabilities for loss or damage resulting in any manner whatsoever to the freight or express matter in Charge of the party of the third part, or to any of its employes, agents-, messengers or officers, upon any line covered by this agreement; it being distinctly understood and agreed that all damages resulting to express matter \u2022 or to persons in the service of the party of the third part (while engaged in such service) shall be borne by the American Express Company.\u2019</p><p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b484-11\" pgmap=\"484(28) 485(90)\">And whereas, since making said contract, said parties have, in the interests of mutual economy, upon certain trains and upon certain lines, consolidated the work of the baggageman employed by the party of the first or second part, with the work of the express messenger employed by the party of the third part\u2014so that the same person acts as joint employe of the party of the first or second part and the party of the third part, a portion of his salary being paid by the party of the first or second part and the balance by the party of the third part, in pursuance of an agreement to that effect heretofore made by the parties hereto.</p><p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b485-5\" pgmap=\"485\">Now, therefore, in consideration of the premises and other valuable considerations, each to the other paid, the said parties hereby mutually agree that the said contract, and the clause therein which is above quoted, shall be, and the same is hereby modified and changed to read as follows :</p><p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b485-6\" pgmap=\"485\">\u2018 As one of the express conditions of this contract, the party of the third part hereby binds and obligates itself to save harmless and fully indemnify the parties of the first and second parts, and each of them, their respective officers and employes, from and against all actions and liabilities for loss or damage resulting in any mariner whatsoever to the freight or express matter in charge of the party of the third part, or to any of its employes, agents, messengers, or officers, upon any line covered by this agreement; it being distinctly understood and agreed that all damages resulting to express matter or to persons in the service of the party of the third part (while engaged in such service) shall be borne by the American Express Company.</p><p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b485-8\" pgmap=\"485(213) 486(25)\">\u2018 Provided, however, that in all cases where the same person acts jointly as baggageman for the party of the first or second part, and express messenger for the party of the third part, then that any sum or sums paid out in settlement or satisfaction of any claims made, or judgment recovered, on account of injuries sustained by such joint employe while performing duties exclusively in the interest of the party of the first and second part, outside of and away from the'car in which the baggage and express packages in his charge are carried, while traveling as aforesaid, on said road, shall be assumed and borne by the party of the first or second part.

On January 15, 1896, the passenger train on which he was riding in the baggage car, in which the express matter he had in charge was being carried, ran into the rear corner of the caboose of a freight train which had been partly pulled off upon a switch or side track in order to permit the passenger train which plaintiff was riding, to pass. The rear end, only, of the caboose projected upon the track of the passenger- train, and a piece of one of its timbers broke into the express car and hit the plaintiff and caused the injuries of which he complains. - -</p> <p id=\"Au8L\" pgmap=\"488\">It appeared in evidence that the first cause of the caboose being left in its dangerous place, was the breaking of a link in the chain of freight cars that were being hauled off upon the side track, causing the freight train to separate, and leaving its extreme end\u2014the caboose\u2014projecting in part upon the main track..</p> <p id=\"b488-4\" pgmap=\"488\">Whether or not the defendant was liable for \u2022 negligence in respects of the, broken- link, and the consequent collision, will not be discussed at length by us at this time, although we have considered the case in that aspect.. The evidence showed, without controversy, that the defect in the link which caused it to break was a latent one, beyond discovery by the exercise of all reasonable diligence; but whether, after the break, there was not time enough before the collision, in the exercise of proper diligence by defendant\u2019s servants, to have got the caboose clear of the main track, is not so certain.</p> <p id=\"b488-5\" pgmap=\"488\">We prefer to place our decision upon the point that caused the trial court to take the case from the jury, by a peremptory- instruction to find the defendant not guilty.</p> <p id=\"b488-6\" pgmap=\"488\">That point is that, whether there was legal negligence by the defendant or not, the plaintiff had by special contract, previously entered into, released, the defendant from all liability in the premises.</p> <p id=\"b488-7\" pgmap=\"488\">We will not particularly enter upon the contention of plaintiff that such contract of release was improperly admitted in evidence under the condition of the pleadings at the time of the trial. It is enough for the'purpose of getting directly at the main question in the case, which demands early decision because not only of what is involved in this case but collaterally, to hold, without much discussion, that the release was admissible.</p> <p id=\"b488-8\" pgmap=\"488(60) 489(16)\">. The plaintiff had testified to his employment with the express company, that he knew the terms of his employ-' ment and that they were set forth in the writing identified by him as bearing his signature. The writing was then, we think, clearly admissible under the general issue, in order to show the terms and conditions of plaintiff\u2019s employment by the express company, and his relation to the defendant at the time of the accident.</p> <p id=\"b489-4\" pgmap=\"489\">The relationship of express companies to railroad companies, over whose lines express matter is carried under special .contracts, is well set forth in Express Cases, 117 U. S. 1, to which we refer rather than quote from, and the doctrine there upheld is, that special contracts between such companies, giving special and exclusive privileges to express companies, are lawful.</p> <p id=\"b489-5\" pgmap=\"489\">It was by virtue of the contract between the defendant and the express company that the plaintiff was upon the car when he was injured. He was not in the strict sense a passenger. Hor was the defendant in the strict sense a common carrier as to him. His being carried from one end of the express route to the other, was for the\u00bb purpose, and none other, of handling and caring for the property of his employer, the express company, which was being transported under the terms of the special contract between the express company and the defendant.</p> <p id=\"b489-6\" pgmap=\"489\">It was not the duty of the defendant, as a common carrier, to carry for the express company its goods, or its messenger in charge of them, in the car in question. As a common carrier the defendant was not compelled to grant that right to the express company. It was only because of the special contract that such rights, superior to the rights of the public, were conferred, and being upon the car by virtue of such contract rights, the plaintiff was there subject to the burdens of the contract. His rights were those of his employer, the express company, and no greater. He could not accept the right to'be there under the contract, and reject the conditions under which the contract gave the right.</p> <p id=\"b489-7\" pgmap=\"489(63) 490(50)\">Had the defendant occupied in the premises the position of performing a public or quasi public duty to the plaintiff, such as it would have held to him if he were being carried as an ordinary passenger, we understand the law would not have permitted him to contract away his right of recourse for damages for the defendant\u2019s negligence, and in no case could a common carrier, even by express contract, in Illinois, exempt itself from liability resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct committed by itself or its servants. C. &amp; N. W. Ry. Co. v. Chapman, 133 Ill. 96; I. C. R. R. Co. v. Read, 37 Ill. 484.</p> <p id=\"b490-5\" pgmap=\"490\">But, under the evidence, there does not arise in this case any question of gross or willful negligence.</p> <p id=\"b490-6\" pgmap=\"490\">As already said, the defendant was not, as to the plaintiff or his employer, in the discharge of the public duties required of it as a common carrier, and the plaintiff might, therefore, as he did, contract to assume the risks of the trip himself, and release the defendant from all liability on account of injuries to him.</p> <p id=\"b490-7\" pgmap=\"490\">The plaintiff in his contract with the express company ratified, as his own, and made a part of such contract, the contract between the express company and the defendant, and agreed to be bound thereby. He was bound, therefore, to know that the express company, and himself as its representative, had a right to ride in the car only by special license, which he could not accept and at the same time continue to hold defendant liable for injuries that might befall him.</p> <p id=\"b490-8\" pgmap=\"490\">It is not pretended that what we have said constitutes an exhaustive or thorough opinion upon the question. It is one not yet decided by our Supreme Court, and the little we have said is mainly, though imperfectly, taken from opinions of the Supreme Court of Indiana, which commend themselves to us by the reason and authority there shown.</p> <p id=\"b490-9\" pgmap=\"490\">A reference to Louisville, N. A. &amp; C. Ry. Co. v. Keefer, 146 Ind. 21, and Pittsburgh, C., C. &amp; St. L. Ry. Co. v. Mahoney, 148 Ind. 196, where similar contracts were involved and able discussion is had, will serve the purposes of counsel in this case, and the profession generally, as well as could be done by an exhaustive opinion here.</p> <p id=\"b490-10\" pgmap=\"490\">Eumerous minor questions are argued, concerning which we discover nothing amounting to reversible error or requiring further comment.</p> <p id=\"b490-11\" pgmap=\"490\">The judgment of the Superior Court is affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
