O. Jenkins and Joseph Dill an order upon the county treasurer for $237.50, which had been allowed them by the board of supervisors for medical attendance furnished county paupers.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b662-11\" pgmap=\"662(148) 663(34)\">The bill alleges that on the 26th day of April, 1898, complainant, as supervisor and ex-offioio overseer of the poor of Paris township, in said county, entered into a written contract with four physicians for medical treatment of the poor of the township for the year commencing May 1, 1898, for $800; that on the 28th day of April, 1898, a committee of the board of supervisors of the county made a contract with L.
