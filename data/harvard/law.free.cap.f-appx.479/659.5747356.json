Guevara contends that the Government breached his plea agreement by not moving for a reduction for acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1. Guevara did not object based on a breach of the plea agreement in the district court and concedes that review is for plain error only. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135-36, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-23\">\u201cPlea bargain agreements are contractual in nature, and are to be construed accordingly.\u201d <em>United States v. Moulder, </em>141 F.3d 568, 571 (5th Cir.1998) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \u201cIn determining whether the terms of the plea bargain have been violated, [this] court must determine whether the government\u2019s conduct is consistent with the parties\u2019 reasonable understanding of the agreement.\u201d <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>309 F.3d 882, 886 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-24\">In exchange for Guevara\u2019s guilty plea, the Government agreed not to \u201ccontest any recommended findings in the Presen-tence Report that the applicable guideline offense level be adjusted to reflect Defendant\u2019s acceptance of responsibility, as provided by Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 3El.l(a).\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>The agreement further provided that \u201c[i]n the event the Court determines Defendant is entitled to the adjustment and further finds that the base offense before that adjustment is at least level 16 the Government agrees to move for the third level reduction at the time of sentencing based on the defendant\u2019s timely agreement to plead guilty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">Because the presentence report (PSR) did not recommend an adjustment for acceptance of responsibility, there was no fulfillment of the condition that would have triggered the Government\u2019s obligation not to oppose Guevara\u2019s request for a downward adjustment and move for an additional acceptance point. <em>See United States v. Mejia, </em>24 F.3d 239, 1994 WL 243287, *1 (5th Cir. May 19, 1994). Further, Guevara\u2019s own objections to the PSR reflect that his understanding of the plea agreement was that the Government would not contest the court\u2019s granting of the two initial acceptance points and would only move \u201cfor a third level reduction at the time of sentence if the Court grants Defendant\u2019s request for a finding of acceptance of responsibility.\u201d Accordingly, Guevara\u2019s argument on appeal that the Government should have been more \u201cactive\u201d in ensuring that he receive his full downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility is not a reasonable understanding of the agreement. <em>See Gonzalez, </em>309 F.3d at 886. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b685-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
