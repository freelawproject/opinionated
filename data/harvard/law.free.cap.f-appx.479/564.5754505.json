We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-18\">Graves first contends that the district court erred by applying the career offender enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. We review that court\u2019s application of the Guidelines de novo and review its factual findings are reviewed for clear error. <em>See United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-19\">Under \u00a7 4B1.1, a defendant is a career offender if, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cthe defendant has at least two prior felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense.\u201d \u00a7 4Bl.l(a). The instant dispute turns on whether Graves\u2019s 1999 Texas conviction for delivery of a controlled substance qualifies as a predicate offense for the career offender enhancement by constituting a \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d under \u00a7 4Bl.l(a). <em>See </em>\u00a7 4B1.2(b) (defining \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 4B1.1).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-20\">The charging document and judgment for that conviction were admitted into evidence at Graves\u2019s resentencing. The charging document indicates that Graves \u201cintentionally and knowingly delivered] by actual and constructive transfer to L.O. Beals a controlled substance, namely cocaine.\u201d Graves contends that the charging document demonstrates that his conviction could have been based merely on a constructive transfer of cocaine and that his case is governed by <em>United States v. Gonzales, </em>484 F.3d 712, 714-16 (5th Cir.2007), because a constructive transfer encompasses a mere offer to sell.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-21\">His contention is unavailing. \u201cThe actual or constructive transfer of a controlled substance is rationally understood to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>distribution, which is specifically included in the definition of a controlled substance offense set forth in \u00a7 4B1.2.\u201d <em>United States v. Roberts, </em>255 Fed.Appx. 849, 851 (5th Cir.2007). As Graves\u2019s charging document indicates that he delivered the controlled substance through actual or constructive delivery, and was not merely an offer to sell, the district court did not err in determining that the conviction in dispute constituted a controlled substance offense under \u00a7 4Bl.l(a). <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">Graves also claims that the district court erred on resentencing by refusing to consider the merits of his objections and arguments apart from the career offender enhancement. \u201cWhether the law of the case doctrine foreclosed the district court\u2019s exercise of discretion on remand and the interpretation of the scope of this court\u2019s remand order present questions of law that this court reviews <em>de novo.\u201d United States v. Lee, </em>358 F.3d 315, 320 (5th Cir.2004). Ordinarily, under the law of the case doctrine, \u201can issue of fact or law decided on appeal may not be reexamined either by the district court on remand or by the appellate court on subsequent appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The mandate rule is \u201ca specific application of the general doctrine of law of the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 321 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \u201cAbsent exceptional circumstances, the mandate rule compels compliance on remand with the dictates of a superior court and forecloses relitigation of issues expressly or impliedly decided by the appellate court.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">Graves has not briefed any contention regarding the applicability of, or any exception to, the law of the case doctrine or the mandate rule. <em>See United States v. Edwards, </em>303 F.3d 606, 647 (5th Cir.2002) (recognizing that issues not briefed are waived). Thus, he has not demonstrated any error regarding the extent of the district court\u2019s consideration of the sentencing issues that he raised on resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b591-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
