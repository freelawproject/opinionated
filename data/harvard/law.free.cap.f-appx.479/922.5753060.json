Specifically, in 2005 Cajetas pleaded guilty to third-degree child abuse in violation of Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 827.03(1). At his removal hearing, Cajetas sought relief from removal pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He explained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"924\">*924</page-number>that the 2005 guilty plea arose out of consensual sexual relations with a fourteen-year old, who he was led to believe was sixteen, when Cajetas was eighteen. The IJ determined that this crime constituted \u201csexual abuse of a minor,\u201d which is included as an aggravated felony under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(A). As a result, Cajetas was not eligible for withholding of removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(a)(3). The BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision, citing Cajetas\u2019s plea colloquy from 2005, and Florida case law establishing that a child abuse conviction under Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 827.03(1) may involve sexual conduct. Cajetas argues on appeal that his prior conviction does not constitute an \u201caggravated felony\u201d under \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b950-4\">Whether a conviction qualifies as an aggravated felony for the purposes of \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(A) is a question of law that we review <em>de novo. Accardo v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>634 F.3d 1333, 1335-36 (11th Cir.2011); <em>see also </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C), (D) (granting courts of appeals jurisdiction to review constitutional claims and questions of law). Further, this Court reviews only the decision of the BIA, except to the extent that the BIA expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b950-5\">Title 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101 defines \u201caggravated felony,\u201d in relevant part, as \u201cmurder, rape, or sexual abuse of a minor.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(A). This Court has previously defined \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d under \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(A) as encompassing \u201ca perpetrator\u2019s physical or nonphysical misuse or maltreatment of a minor for a purpose associated with sexual gratification.\u201d <em>United States v. Padilla-Reyes, 247 </em>F.3d 1158, 1163 (11th Cir.2001). In determining whether a prior conviction constitutes an aggravated felony under \u00a7 1101(a)(43), we first apply the categorical method and look to the \u201cfact of conviction and the statutory definition of the offense.\u201d <em>Jaggemauth v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>432 F.3d 1346, 1353 (11th Cir.2005). Where the statutory definition underlying the prior conviction contains some offenses that are aggravated felonies, and others that are not, we apply a modified categorical approach and examine the information, the plea agreement or colloquy, and the judgment to determine whether the prior conviction is an aggravated felony under \u00a7 1101(a)(43). <em>See id. </em>at 1355.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-10\">Cajetas argues that the categorical approach suffices to demonstrate that his conviction under Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 827.03(1) does not constitute \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d under \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(A). Specifically, he argues that, because \u00a7 827.03(1) lacks any explicit sexual element, it does not fall under \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(A).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Further, he argues that the BIA erred by applying the modified categorical approach, when this Court had already defined \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d in <em>Padillar-Reyes </em>for the purposes of \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(A). However, our precedent makes clear that an immigration court must apply either the categorical or modified categorical approach to determine whether a person\u2019s prior conviction qualifies as an \u201caggravated felony\u201d under \u00a7 1101(a)(43). Therefore, it was not error for the BIA to employ the modified categorical approach, even though this Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"925\">*925</page-number>has provided a definition of \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d under \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(A).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b951-4\">In determining whether a guilty plea under \u00a7 827.03(1) constitutes \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d under \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(A), it was proper for the BIA to analyze relevant state court decisions. <em>See United States v. Ramirez-Garcia, </em>646 F.3d 778, 784 (11th Cir.2011). In this case, the BIA cited <em>DuFresne v. State, </em>826 So.2d 272 (Fla.2002), which indicates that \u201cabuse\u201d under \u00a7 827.03(1) includes \u201cany willful act or threatened act that results in any physical, mental, or sexual injury or harm that causes or is likely to cause the child\u2019s mental health to be significantly impaired.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 278. Under this definition, a conviction under \u00a7 827.03(1) can result from either sexual or non-sexual abuse. Given that \u00a7 827.03(1) covers conduct both within and beyond the scope of \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(A), it was appropriate for the BIA to apply the modified categorical approach and consider the record of Cajetas\u2019s guilty plea to determine whether his conviction constitutes \u201csexual abuse of a minor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b951-5\">Specifically, the BIA properly considered Cajetas\u2019s plea colloquy from the \u00a7 827.03(1) conviction to make its determination. <em>See Jaggemauth, </em>432 F.3d at 1355. During this plea colloquy, the state advised the Florida court that it was prepared to prove at trial that Cajetas \u201cdid knowingly or willfully abuse a child by engaging in sexual activity with [the victim] and that action was likely to cause her mental injury.\u201d Cajetas took \u201cno exceptions\u201d to this statement. This plea colloquy indicates that Cajetas\u2019s child abuse conviction under \u00a7 827.03(1) involved sexual activity, which brings his conviction within the definition of an aggravated felony under \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(A). Therefore, the BIA correctly concluded that Cajetas is not eligible for cancellation of removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b951-11\">For the reasons stated, we DENY Caje-tas\u2019s petition.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b949-11\">. This provision permits the Attorney General to cancel removal of permanent residents under certain circumstances, provided that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"924\">*924</page-number>person has not been convicted of an aggravated felony. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b950-7\">. Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 827.03(1) defines child abuse as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b950-8\">(a)Intentional infliction of physical or mental injury upon a child;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b950-11\">(b) An intentional act that could reasonably be expected to result in physical or mental injury to a child; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b950-12\">(c) Active encouragement of any person to commit an act that results or could reasonably be expected to result in physical or mental injury to a child.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b951-6\">. Cajetas also argues that the BIA erred by employing the modified categorical approach, because federal law already defines \"sexual abuse of a minor\u201d under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2243. This argument similarly misunderstands the purpose of the modified categorical approach.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
