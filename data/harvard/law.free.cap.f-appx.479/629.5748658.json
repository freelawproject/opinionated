Earl Stephen Dean appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his claims against the Mississippi Board of Bar Admissions. The district court held that Dean is not entitled to relief under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, because his claims are barred by the doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel. Because the district court committed no reversible error, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court, based on its well-reasoned opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">Because we have already recounted the facts and much of the procedural history of this case in detail, <em>see Dean v. Miss. Bd. of Bar Admissions (Dean I), </em>826 Fed.Appx. 760, 762-63 (5th Cir.2009), we do not repeat them in full here.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">In summary of the pertinent facts, in 2002, Dean\u2019s application for admission to the Mississippi Bar was denied by the Mississippi Board of Bar Admissions (the Board) because he demonstrated \u201can inclination to be dishonest, an inclination to take unfair advantage of others, an inclination to fail to exercise self-control, and an inclination to be mentally or emotionally unstable to the extent that he was not suited to the practice of law.\u201d Over the course of several years, Dean \u2014 to no avail \u2014 exhausted all of his appeals before the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">Thus, in October 2005, Dean appealed the Board\u2019s decision to the Hinds County Chancery Court, urging the court to reverse the Board\u2019s decision and allow him to sit for the Mississippi Bar exam. Dean argued that the Board had violated his First Amendment right to freedom of speech as well as his Fourteenth Amendment right to due process. In its affir-mance of the Board\u2019s decision, the chancery court considered Dean\u2019s constitutional arguments and held that the Board had committed no constitutional violations. In September 2006, Dean appealed to the Mississippi Supreme Court, raising the same constitutional arguments. The Supreme Court rejected Dean\u2019s appeal, holding that the Board had not violated Dean\u2019s constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-10\">At the same time he was appealing the Board\u2019s refusal to let him sit for the bar exam in Mississippi state courts, Dean filed two lawsuits in federal district courts against the chairperson of the Board.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The first federal lawsuit, filed on February 8, 2006, claimed damages under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 and alleged violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The second lawsuit, the subject of the instant appeal, was filed on May 17, 2006, and sought prospective and injunctive relief against the Board on the grounds that Dean should be protected from future First Amendment violations by the Board. This suit was also brought under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. The district court dismissed both of Dean\u2019s lawsuits on the grounds of the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In a consolidated appeal in <em>Dean I, </em>this court reversed and remanded both cases to the United States District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi, holding that the district court did not properly apply the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine nor did the court properly consider the doctrines of collateral estoppel or <em>res judicata. See Dean I, </em>326 Fed.Appx. at 762-63.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-11\">First, the district court reheard Dean\u2019s case asserting his ADA and his \u00a7 1983 claims for damages and dismissed his complaint on grounds of <em>res judicata. </em>Thereafter, in <em>Dean II, </em>we affirmed. <em>Dean v. Miss. Bd. of Bar Admissions (Dean II), </em>394 Fed.Appx. 172 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-12\">After our affirmance of the dismissal of Dean\u2019s ADA and \u00a7 1983 damages claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>on the grounds of <em>res judicata, </em>the district court turned to the case <em>sub judice, </em>addressing Dean\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claims for prospective, injunctive relief. The district court, relying heavily upon our opinion in <em>Dean II, </em>held that, in the light of the Mississippi Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>In re Dean, </em>972 So.2d 590 (Miss.2008), Dean\u2019s current federal lawsuit was barred by the doctrines of collateral estoppel and <em>res judica-ta. </em>Thus, the district court dismissed Dean\u2019s complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) or, in the alternative, granted summary judgment in favor of the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-4\">Once again, Dean appeals, arguing that the district court erred by holding that his claims were precluded by the doctrines of collateral estoppel and <em>res judicata.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">Dean\u2019s primary argument on appeal\u2014 which is the same argument he raised in <em>Dean II </em>\u2014 is that the district court erred by applying the <em>res judicata </em>doctrine to foreclose this lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">For essentially the same reasons we decided Dean\u2019s lawsuit was precluded in <em>Dean II, </em>we find that Dean\u2019s present appeal has no merit. After reviewing the Mississippi Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>In re Dean, </em>we hold that all of the elements of <em>res judicata </em>have been met here. <em>See Harrison v. Chandler-Sampson Ins., Inc.,. </em>891 So.2d 224, 232 (Miss.2005). Moreover, we hold that both the chancery court and the Mississippi Supreme Court considered <em>de novo </em>Dean\u2019s arguments that his First and Fourteenth Amendment rights had been violated, the same arguments which give rise to his present federal suit for injunctive relief. <em>See Dean II, </em>394 Fed.Appx. at 176 <em>(citing In re Dean, </em>972 So.2d at 597-98). Because Dean is precluded from bringing the present action, the district court did not err by dismissing his complaint under Rule 12(b)(6).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b657-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-13\">We hold that the district court did not err by dismissing this suit under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). Essentially for the reasons given by the district court in its well-considered opinion, the judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b657-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b655-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, tire court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b656-7\">. The original chairperson of the Board named as a defendant in this lawsuit was James R. Mozingo. Mozingo has since been replaced \u2014 both as <em>-a </em>defendant and as chairperson of the Board \u2014 by Pieter Teeuwissen.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b656-8\">. The <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine establishes that federal courts have subject matter jurisdiction to review general challenges to the constitutionality of state bar admissions rules but lack jurisdiction to review a state court's final judgment in a bar admission matter. <em>D.C. Ct. of Appeals v. Feldman, </em>460 U.S. 462, 482-86, 103 S.Ct. 1303, 75 L.Ed.2d 206 (1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b657-8\">. Because <em>res judicata </em>precludes Dean from bringing this lawsuit, there is no reason for us to address whether collateral estoppel also precludes this suit.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
