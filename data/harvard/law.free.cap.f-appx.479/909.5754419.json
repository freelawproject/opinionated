Mr. Brown argues that the district court procedurally erred by (1) failing to indicate that it considered the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) before modifying his sentence, and (2) failing to articulate its reasons for not granting him a greater reduction, in violation of 18 U.S.C \u00a7 3553(c)(1). We find no reversible error, and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b936-11\">In 1993, a jury convicted Mr. Brown of conspiring to possess, with the intent to distribute, 50 grams or more of crack cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 846 and 841(b)(1)(A)(iii). At sentencing, the district court found that Mr. Brown\u2019s participation in the offense involved at least 5 kilograms of crack cocaine, which resulted in a base offense level of 40. Because he had no other enhancements or reductions, Mr. Brown\u2019s total offense level was also 40. Mr. Brown\u2019s total offense level, together with a criminal-history category of III, resulted in a guideline range of 360 months to life. The district court sentenced Mr. Brown to 360 months imprisonment, the bottom of the guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-13\">In 1996, Mr. Brown filed a motion pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) to reduce his sentence based on Amendment 505 to the Sentencing Guidelines. Amendment 505 revised the drug quantity tables in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) by, among other things, reducing from 40 to 38 the base offense level for an offense involving 5 kilograms or more of crack cocaine. The district court found that the retroactive amendment lowered Mr. Brown\u2019s guideline range, and as a result, modified Mr. Brown\u2019s sentence to 292 months imprisonment, the bottom of the revised guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-14\">Several years later, in 2008, Mr. Brown filed another motion pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) to modify his sentence based on Amendment 706. The district court found that the amendment reduced Mr. Brown\u2019s base offense level from 38 to 36, and again adjusted his sentence to the bottom of the revised guideline range, which was 235 months imprisonment. On appeal, however, we vacated and remanded. <em>See United States v. Brown, </em>330 Fed.Appx. 856 (11th Cir.2009). We concluded that Mr. Brown was not eligible for a sentencing reduction pursuant to Amendment 706 because he was held accountable for more than 5 kilograms of crack cocaine, and Amendment 706 only applied to those convicted of an offense involving less <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"911\">*911</page-number>than 4.5 kilograms of the substance. <em>See id. </em>at 858-59. On remand, the district court reinstated Mr. Brown\u2019s 292-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-5\">In 2011, Mr. Brown filed a third motion pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for a modification of his sentence. This motion was based on Amendment 750, which revised U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) to comport with the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 by lowering the base offense level for crack cocaine offenses. The government opposed any reduction of the sentence, arguing that Mr. Brown was a danger to the community. The district court found that Amendment 750, which was retroactive, entitled Mr. Brown to a 2-point base offense level reduction, from 38 to 36, which resulted in a revised guideline range of 235 to 293 months\u2019 imprisonment. The district court granted the motion and modified Mr. Brown\u2019s sentence to 265 months, the middle of the amended guideline range. The district court stated that it had reviewed the memoranda filed by Mr. Brown and the government, and that it was exercising its discretion to reduce Mr. Brown\u2019s sentence to 265 months, but did not further explain its ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-6\">Mr. Brown now appeals his adjusted sentence, arguing that (1) the district court failed to indicate that it considered the factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a) prior to modifying his sentence, and (2) did not explain its reasons for choosing the particular sentence, in violation of \u00a7 3553(e)(1). The government contends that vacatur is not required because the record demonstrates that the district court took into account the pertinent factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b937-8\">We review a district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. White, </em>305 F.3d 1264, 1267 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b937-9\">Where a defendant was previously \u201csentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission,\u201d a district court \u201cmay reduce the term of imprisonment, after considering the factors set forth in [\u00a7 ] 3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable, if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 3582(c)(2). In addition to the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors and policy statements, the district court must also consider the nature and seriousness of the danger posed to the community by reducing the defendant\u2019s sentence and may consider the defendant\u2019s post-sentencing conduct. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. n.l(B)(i) \u2014 (iii) (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b937-10\">Although required to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors prior to reducing a defendant\u2019s sentence, \u201ca district court commits no reversible error by failing to articulate specifically the applicability \u2014 if any \u2014 of each of the section 3553(a) factors, as long as the record demonstrates that the pertinent factors were taken into account by the district court.\u201d <em>See United States v. Eggersdorf, </em>126 F.3d 1318, 1322 (11th Cir.1997). If, however, the record does not demonstrate that the applicable factors were considered, the defendant\u2019s sentence must be vacated and the case remanded to the district court for further proceedings. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>557 F.3d 1254, 1257 (11th Cir.2009) (vacating and remanding \u201c[bjecause the record is silent as to whether the district court considered the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors when resentencing Williams\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b937-11\">In <em>Eggersdorf, </em>the district court denied the defendant\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion but did not discuss the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. We affirmed the denial, concluding that the record sufficiently demonstrated that the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"912\">*912</page-number>trict court had considered the appropriate \u00a7 3553(a) factors before making its decision. In particular, we noted that the defendant\u2019s motion set out the applicable \u00a7 3553(a) factors; the government\u2019s motion set forth three factual elements of the defendant\u2019s crime and criminal history, which were relevant to one of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors; the district court stated that it had reviewed the record and the parties\u2019 submissions; and the district court judge ruling on the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion was the same judge who had originally sentenced the defendant. <em>See </em>126 F.3d at 1322-23. Similarly, in <em>United States v. Smith, </em>568 F.3d 923, 928-929 (11th Cir.2009), we upheld the district court\u2019s partial reduction of sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) even though the district court did not expressly state in its order that it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. In that case, the district court\u2019s order referenced the defendant\u2019s motion, which stated that the court may consider appropriate information in applying the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and argued why those factors supported a more lenient sentence. In addition, at the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding the arguments presented by the parties focused on the facts pertinent to the factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a). As a result, we concluded that the record contained sufficient evidence that the district court had considered the appropriate factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-4\">Here, the record shows that the district court engaged in the appropriate \u00a7 3553(a) analysis before adjusting Mr. Brown\u2019s sentence to the middle of the revised guideline range. First, the district court\u2019s order cited to the government\u2019s response in opposition to Mr. Brown\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion and Mr. Brown\u2019s reply, both of which discussed the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Specifically, both parties told the district court that it was required to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors prior to modifying Mr. Brown\u2019s sentence and noted specific facts that they believed were pertinent to the \u00a7 3553(a) analysis. The government argued, among other things, that Mr. Brown posed a danger to the community because he had a long prison disciplinary record, which showed he had fought with and assaulted others, possessed weapons and drugs, and had refused to obey orders while incarcerated. In response, Mr. Brown highlighted his efforts to rehabilitate himself while in prison, including earning his GED and taking more than 1,500 hours of educational courses. These facts are relevant to \u00a7\u00a7 3553(a)(1) and (a)(2)(C), which respectively require the district court to consider the \u201chistory and characteristics of the defendant\u201d and \u201cthe need for the sentence imposed ... to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant.\u201d Second, as in <em>Eggersdorf </em>and <em>Smith, </em>the district court expressly confirmed that it had \u201creview[ed] the memoranda filed by both [Mr.] Brown and the United States,\u201d <em>see </em>R913 at 1, and was \u201cexercis[ing] its discretion by reducing [Mr.] Brown\u2019s sentence to a term of 265 months\u2019 imprisonment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2. Third, the district judge who adjusted Mr. Brown\u2019s sentence was the original sentencing judge, and thus was familiar with Mr. Brown and his underlying offense and background.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-7\">Furthermore, on this record, we also conclude that the district court satisfied \u00a7 3553(c)(1)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u2014 assuming it was applicable \u2014 because it stated that it had considered the parties\u2019 arguments and because it was familiar with Mr. Brown. As we read the record, the government\u2019s arguments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"913\">*913</page-number>persuaded the district court to sentence at the middle, and not the bottom, of the amended guideline range. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Cameron, </em>348 Fed.Appx. 444, 446 (11th Cir.2009) (\u201cBecause the court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and stated that it had considered the nature of the underlying offense, Cameron\u2019s criminal history category, and Cameron\u2019s conduct while in prison, the district court adequately articulated its reasons for imposing its mid-range sentence to allow for meaningful appellate review, and did not violate \u00a7 3553(c).\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b939-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b939-5\">Accordingly, although the preferred practice is to articulate the \u00a7 3553(a) factors the court considered prior to modifying a prisoner\u2019s sentence, based on this record, we find that the district court committed no reversible error and affirm. AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b938-5\">. In relevant part, \u00a7 3553(c)(1) provides that \"[t]he court, at the time of sentencing, shall state in open court the reasons for its imposition of the particular sentence, and ... the reason for imposing a sentence at a particular point within the range.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b939-7\">. The parties disagree about whether a district court must adhere to \u00a7 3553(c)(1) in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding. In support of his position that \u00a7 3553(c)(1) applies in a sentence modification proceeding, Mr. Brown cites to <em>Cameron, </em>an unpublished decision from this Court. On the other hand, the government cites to <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2009) (\"By its very terms, [\u00a7 3553(c) ] applies at the time of <em>sentencing, </em>not at the time of sentence <em>modification </em>[pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2)].\u201d). We do need not to decide the issue because we hold that the district court satisfied \u00a7 3553(c)(1) in any event. <em>Cf. Dillon v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, \u2014, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2691, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010) (\"Section 3582(c)(2)'s text, together with its narrow scope, shows that Congress intended to authorize only a limited adjustment to an otherwise final sentence and not a plenary resentencing proceeding... .\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
