On appeal, Lopez argues that his sentence appeal waiver was not knowing and voluntary, and that the district court erred in applying a two-level guideline sentencing enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) for possessing a dangerous weapon. We have already resolved the waiver issue by denying the government\u2019s motion to dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>miss on that ground. Therefore, this opinion only addresses the sentencing issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">We review a district court\u2019s findings of fact under \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) for clear error, and its application of the Sentencing Guidelines to those facts <em>de novo. United States v. Pham, </em>468 F.3d 1239, 1245 (11th Cir.2006). However, it is \u201cnot necessary to decide guidelines issues or remand cases for new sentence proceedings where the guidelines error, if any, did not affect the sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Keene, </em>470 F.3d 1347, 1349 (11th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks omitted). To hold that an alleged guideline error was harmless, we consider whether: (1) the district court would have reached the same result if it had decided the guideline issue the other way; and (2) the sentence imposed was reasonable under the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), even if the guideline issue had been resolved in the defendant\u2019s favor. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">Under \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l), a defendant is subject to a two-level enhancement \u201c[i]f a dangerous weapon (including a firearm) was possessed.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l). The commentary to this section provides as follows: \u201cThe enhancement for weapon possession in subsection (b)(1) reflects the increased danger of violence when drug traffickers possess weapons. The enhancement should be applied if the weapon was present, unless it is clearly improbable that the weapon was connected with the offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2D1.1 comment. (n.3(A)). Possession can be shown by demonstrating the defendant actually possessed the firearm or that he constructively possessed it. <em>United States v. Villarreal, </em>613 F.3d 1344, 1359 (11th Cir.2010). Constructive possession means that the defendant had \u201cownership, dominion, or control over an object itself or control over the premises in which the object is concealed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">As to the reasonableness of the sentence, the district court must impose a sentence \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes\u201d listed in \u00a7 3553(a)(2), including the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, provide just punishment for the offense, deter criminal conduct, and protect the public from the defendant\u2019s future criminal conduct. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). In imposing a particular sentence, the court must also consider, among other factors, the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, the kinds of sentences available, the applicable guideline range, and the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission. <em>See generally id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(1), (3)-(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">\u201cThe review for substantive unreasonableness involves examining the totality of the circumstances, including an inquiry into whether the statutory factors in \u00a7 3553(a) support the sentence in question.\u201d <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319,1324 (11th Cir.2008). The \u201cweight to be accorded any given \u00a7 3553(a) factor is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>526 F.3d 1312, 1322 (11th Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks omitted). We will not reverse unless \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1190 (11th Cir.2010) <em>(en </em>banc) (internal quotation marks omitted), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 131 S.Ct. 1813, 179 L.Ed.2d 772 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-9\">We conclude from the record that any error committed by the district court in imposing a two-level guideline enhancement under \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) was harmless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>under the circumstances. The record demonstrates that the district court would have imposed the same 87-month total sentence of imprisonment even if the guideline issue had been resolved in Lopez\u2019s favor, and his sentence would have been reasonable if his advisory guideline range had been calculated absent the enhancement. <em>See Keene, </em>470 F.3d at 1349. Accordingly, we affirm Lopez\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
