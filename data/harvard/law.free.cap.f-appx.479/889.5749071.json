After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-13\">In November 1995, the district court sentenced Nunez to 262 months imprisonment, following his plea of guilty to one count of distribution of crack cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). Under the then-applicable Guidelines, the base offense level for Nunez was 32. In light of prior convictions, however, Nunez was deemed a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. As a result, his offense level was raised to 37, and his criminal history category to VI. The district court lowered the offense level by three levels for acceptance of responsibility. Based on an offense level of 34 and a criminal history category of VI, the district court found that the guideline range was 262 to 327 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-15\">In November 2011, Nunez filed a motion for a sentence reduction under Section 3582(c)(2). Nunez asked the district court to reduce his sentence based on Amendment 750 to the Guidelines, as well as the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 (FSA), Pub.L. No. 111-220, 124 Stat. 2372 (2010). In December 2011, the district court denied Nunez\u2019s motion. On appeal, Nunez argues that the district court erred in concluding that he was not entitled to relief. We are not persuaded by this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-16\">As the Supreme Court has observed, Section 3582(c)(2) \u201cdoes not authorize a [full] sentencing or resentencing proceeding.\u201d <em>Dillon v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, \u2014, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2690, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010). Under Section 3582(c)(2), a district court may \u201csubstitute <em>only </em>the amendments ... for the corresponding guideline provisions that were applied when the defendant was sentenced.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(1) (emphasis added). The district court must \u201cleave <em>all other </em>guideline application decisions unaffected.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). Thus, relief under Section 3582(c)(2) is not available if \u201cthe amendment [to the guideline provision that is at issue] does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range <em>because of the operation of another guideline.\u201d Id. </em>cmt. n. 1(a) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-20\">Here, the district court was required to adhere to its prior determination that, under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, Nunez was a career offender and his offense level was 37. In other words, by virtue of that guideline <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>provision, Amendment 750 did not have' the effect of lowering Nunez\u2019s offense level and his guideline range. <em>See United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1327-28 (11th Cir.2008) (holding that Amendment 706 to the guidelines did not have the effect of lowering the guideline range for defendants who were designated career offenders under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1). The district court therefore was correct to conclude that Amendment 750 did not give Nunez relief under Section 3582(c)(2). <em>See United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1190 (11th Cir.2009) (\u201c[A] district court is bound by the limitations on its discretion imposed by \u00a7 3582(c)(2).... \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">We also cannot say that the district court erred in rejecting Nunez\u2019s request for a sentence reduction based on the FSA itself. Section 3582(c)(2) only authorizes sentence reductions based on amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(l) (authorizing sentence reductions because of \u201can amendment to the Guidelines Manual\u201d). To the extent Nunez suggests that the FSA is otherwise applicable to him, we must reject that assertion as well. Our precedent makes it clear that the FSA does not apply to a defendant, like Nunez, who was sentenced prior to the effective date of the act. <em>See United States v. Gomes, </em>621 F.3d 1343, 1346 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b917-6\">Finally, Nunez suggests that the limitations on a district court\u2019s discretion under Section 3582(c)(2) offend the separation of powers. We cannot agree. It is well settled that \u201cthe scope of judicial discretion with respect to a sentence is subject to congressional control,\u201d to the extent that such control does not otherwise run afoul of a constitutional guarantee. <em>Mistretta v. United States, </em>488 U.S. 361, 364, 109 S.Ct. 647, 651, 102 L.Ed.2d 714 (1989). Thus, Congress may, consistent with the separation of powers, limit the availability of sentence reductions under Section 3582(c)(2), which as the Supreme Court has observed, \u201care not constitutionally compelled\u201d but rather constitute \u201ca congressional act of lenity.\u201d <em>Dillon, </em>130 S.Ct. at 2692.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-8\">For these reasons, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
