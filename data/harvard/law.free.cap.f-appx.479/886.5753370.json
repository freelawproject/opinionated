After review, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b913-11\">Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court has the authority to modify a defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment if the defendant\u2019s sentence was \u201cbased on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. [\u00a7 ] 944(o).\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 IB 1.10(a)(1). If, however, the amended guideline does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s sentencing range, the district court has no authority to reduce the defendant\u2019s sentence. <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1330 (11th Cir.2008); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B). For this reason, a sentence reduction is not authorized if the amendment does not lower a defendant\u2019s applicable guidelines range \u201cbecause of the operation of another guideline or statutory provision.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 cmt. n. 1(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b913-16\">Moreover, when a defendant is subject to a statutory mandatory minimum sentence, in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding the district court must calculate the defendant\u2019s new guideline range as dictated by the mandatory minimum, regardless of any downward departure during the original sentencing. <em>See United States v. Mills, </em>613 F.3d 1070, 1078 (11th Cir.2010) (\u201c \u2018[T]he guidelines range for a defendant subject to a statutory minimum would not be lowered by an amendment, even if the amendment would otherwise be applicable to the defendant.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>United States v. Williams, </em>549 F.3d 1337, 1341 (11th Cir.2008)). As we explained in <em>Williams, </em>\u201cthe statutorily required minimum sentence effectively displaces the shorter sentence and becomes the guideline sentence for that individual.\u201d 549 F.3d at 1340. Thus, when a defendant is sentenced based on the statutory mandatory minimum, any substantial assistance reduction \u201cwould thereby be from the mandatory minimum rather than from the base offense level.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b913-17\">Here, Rumph\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion is based on Amendment 750 to the Sentencing Guidelines, which revised the crack cocaine quantity tables in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 to conform to the Fair Sentencing Act of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>2010. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, amend. 750. Rumph\u2019s original 240-month sentence, however, was not based on \u00a7 2D 1.1\u2019s drug quantity tables, but on the statutory mandatory minimum. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(b)(1)(A), 851; U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(b) (providing that the statutory mandatory minimum is the guidelines sentence if it exceeds the otherwise applicable guidelines range). Although the district court subsequently granted the government\u2019s Rule 35(b) substantial-assistance motion and reduced Rumph\u2019s sentence to 180 months, that reduction was from the statutory mandatory minimum. Thus, Amendment 750 did not lower Rumph\u2019s sentencing range.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-4\">There is also no merit to Rumph\u2019s argument that relies on a recent amendment to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(B). Generally, a district court granting a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion cannot reduce the defendant\u2019s prison term below the low end of the new, amended guidelines range. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(2)(A). However, if, at the original sentencing, the defendant received a substantial assistance reduction below the defendant\u2019s original guidelines range <em>and </em>the defendant\u2019s guidelines range \u201chas subsequently been lowered as a result of an amendment to the Guidelines Manual ..., the court may reduce the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment as provided in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2)\u201d and, under \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(B), a comparable substantial-assistance reduction to \u201cthe amended guideline range\u201d may be appropriate at resentencing. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)-(b).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b915-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>The problem for Rumph is that \u00a7 1B1.10(b) does not create a new guidelines range or amend Rumph\u2019s original guidelines range. Section lB1.10(b) applies only after the district has concluded, under \u00a7 1131.10(a), that (1) an amendment (here Amendment 750) lowered the defendant\u2019s guidelines range used at the original sentencing; and (2) it has authority to reduce the defendant\u2019s sentence as provided in \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>Id. </em>If the district court determines it lacks authority to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 8582(c)(2), the inquiry ends and subsection (b) does not come into play.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">Here, Rumph\u2019s sentence was based on the statutory mandatory minimum, his substantial-assistance reduction was from that statutory mandatory minimum, and Amendment 750 had no effect on his guideline sentence of 240 months dictated by the statutory mandatory minimum. Thus, Rumph was not eligible for resen-tencing under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and \u00a7 lBl.l(a), and therefore amended \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(B) does not apply to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-6\">In sum, the district court did not have authority to reduce Rumph\u2019s sentence and properly denied his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b913-13\">. \"In a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding, we review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v.
