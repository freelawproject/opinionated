He appeals the district court\u2019s denials of his motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction and improper venue, his motion to suppress the information found on his laptop computer and Palm Pilot device, and an alleged variance between the indictment and the proof at trial. He also challenges the district court\u2019s response to a jury question during deliberations, the district court\u2019s failure to dismiss Counts 1 and 2 based on the lack of any actual victim and an alleged Tenth Amendment violation, the alleged overbreadth and vagueness of Count 1, and his allegedly unconstitutional sentence on Count 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-13\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>questions concerning the jurisdiction of the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Phillips, </em>597 F.3d 1190, 1194 n. 9 (11th Cir.2010) (internal quotation marks omitted). We normally review constitutional issues <em>de novo. United States v. Steed, </em>548 F.3d 961, 978 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b907-15\">Section 3231 of Title 18 grants district courts \u201coriginal jurisdiction ... of all offenses against the laws of the United States.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231. Prior to the Congressional enactment of this statute, district courts possessed original jurisdiction over criminal cases under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 41(2). <em>See Farnsworth v. Sanford, </em>115 F.2d 375, 379 (5th Cir.1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b907-16\">\u201cThe Sixth Amendment and Rule 18 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure guarantee the right of a defendant to be tried in the district in which the offense was committed.\u201d <em>United States v. Roberts, </em>308 F.3d 1147, 1151 (11th Cir.2002). However, a defendant may waive such right by failing to raise a venue objection prior to trial. <em>Id. </em>at 1151-52. Nevertheless, if the indictment alleges an incorrect venue and the defendant was not aware of the defect until the government presented its case, an objection at the close of evidence comes soon enough to preserve the issue for appeal. <em>Id. </em>at 1152; <em>United States v. Greer, </em>440 F.3d 1267, 1271 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b907-17\">Our review of the record persuades us that the district court properly exercised jurisdiction over the instant case. Schumaker\u2019s arguments with regard to personal, territorial, and subject-matter jurisdiction are uniformly meritless. With regard to personal jurisdiction, Schumaker may not challenge the district court\u2019s personal jurisdiction based on the alleged unlawfulness of his arrest. With regard to territorial jurisdiction, Schumaker was not indicted for his thoughts or the conversations that took place while he was on his computer in Canada. He was indicted for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>arranging a meeting over the internet with a person he believed to be a mother interested in incest with her 11-year old daughter, having sexual conversations in the same vein with the girl he believed to be the 11-year old daughter, traveling to the Northern District of Georgia to meet the woman and her daughter at a local restaurant prior to their sexual encounter, and possessing child pornography. Consequently, he committed criminal acts in the United States and his arguments to the contrary, including those relying on his Canadian citizenship, are baseless.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-4\">With regard to subject-matter jurisdiction, we conclude from the record that Schumaker\u2019s arguments concerning 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231 are meritless. First, in each federal criminal appeal that we and our predecessor court, the former Fifth Circuit, have heard since 1948, we have implicitly recognized the legitimacy of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231. Second, even if 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231 was not properly enacted, its predecessor in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 41(2), provided a proper grant of jurisdiction to the district court regarding criminal cases. <em>See Farnsworth, </em>115 F.2d at 379. Finally, we find this argument to be \u201cunbelievably frivolous.\u201d <em>See United States v. Collins, </em>510 F.3d at 697, 698 (7th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b908-5\">We conclude from the record that Schumaker waived any challenge to the district court\u2019s venue. Prior to trial, Schu-maker never expressly challenged the district court as the proper venue for his trial, which waived any venue challenge on appeal based on the standard explicated in <em>Greer. </em>His argument concerning venue is based on his contention that he committed no criminal acts in the United States, which he has been consistently pleading from the time of his arrest. Accordingly, he was aware of the alleged defect in the indictment with respect to venue, and his failure to present the issue prior to trial effectively waived consideration of this issue. <em>See Greer, </em>440 F.3d at 1271.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-8\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress under a mixed standard, reviewing the district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error, and its application of the law to those facts <em>de novo. United States v. Bervaldi, </em>226 F.3d 1256, 1262 (11th Cir.2000). \u201cFurther, when considering a ruling on a motion to suppress, all facts are construed in the light most favorable to the prevailing party below.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201c[W]e allot substantial deference to the factfinder ... in reaching credibility determinations with respect to witness testimony.\u201d <em>United States v. McPhee, </em>336 F.3d 1269, 1275 (11th Cir.2003) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see United States v. Floyd, </em>281 F.3d 1346, 1348 (11th Cir.2002) (holding that we also credit implicit credibility determinations).</p>\n<p id=\"b908-9\">While the Fourth Amendment does not specify that search warrants must contain expiration dates, Rule 41 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure requires that a search warrant be executed within a specified period of time not to exceed 10 days. <em>United States v. Gerber, </em>994 F.2d 1556, 1559 (11th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b908-10\">\u201cUnless a clear constitutional violation occurs, noncompliance with Rule 41 requires suppression of evidence only where (1) there was \u2018prejudice\u2019 in the sense that the search might not have occurred or would not have been so abrasive if the rule had been followed, or (2) there is evidence of intentional and deliberate disregard of a provision in the Rule.\u201d <em>Gerber, </em>994 F.2d at 1560 (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b908-11\">We conclude from the record that the district court did not err by denying Schumaker\u2019s motion to suppress the evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>dence recovered from his laptop computer and Palm Pilot. First, the government did not cause the type of prejudice or act with the type of intentional disregard that we have previously found to require for suppression of evidence under Rule 41. <em>See Gerber, </em>994 F.2d at 1560. This case does not present a situation where the search was broader or more onerous because the materials were allegedly reviewed beyond the 10 days specified by Rule 41 at the time of the search. The relevant electronic materials were \u201cimaged,\u201d which provides an exact copy of the original hard drive, alleviating concerns about \u201cstale warrants.\u201d Furthermore, there was no evidence of bad faith on the part of the government. Accordingly, we conclude that authorities did not violate Rule 41, and the district court properly denied the motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-6\">We review <em>de novo </em>claims of constitutional error, questions of \u201cpure law,\u201d and mixed questions of law and fact. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>527 F.3d 1235, 1239 (11th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Register, </em>182 F.3d 820, 841 (11th Cir.1999); <em>United States v. Eckhardt, </em>466 F.3d 938, 947 (11th Cir.2006). A \u201cfundamental principle\u201d derived from the Fifth Amendment \u201cis that a defendant can only be convicted for a crime charged in the indictment\u201d because \u201c[i]t would be fundamentally unfair to convict a defendant on charges of which he had no notice.\u201d <em>United States v. Keller, </em>916 F.2d 628, 633 (11th Cir.1990). \u201cTwo types of problems can arise as a result of a trial court\u2019s deviation from an indictment,\u201d a (1) constructive amendment or (2) variance. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b909-7\">A variance occurs when \u201cthe evidence produced at trial differs from what is alleged in the indictment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The allegations in the indictment and proof at trial must correspond for two reasons: (1) the defendant should be \u201cproperly notified of the charges so that he may present a defense\u201d; and (2) the defendant should be \u201cprotected against the possibility of another prosecution for the same offense.\u201d <em>United States v. Reed, </em>887 F.2d 1398, 1403 (11th Cir.1989). Unlike a constructive amendment, \u201ca variance requires reversal only when the defendant can establish that his rights were substantially prejudiced thereby.\u201d <em>United States v. Narog, </em>372 F.3d 1243, 1247 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b909-9\">Where a defendant does not allege a variance in the district court, we review such a claim for plain error. <em>United States v. Dennis, </em>237 F.3d 1295, 1300 (11th Cir.2001). The plain-error standard of review for whether a material variance occurred is \u201ctwofold.\u201d Id.' First, we must determine \u201cwhether a material variance did occur, and second, whether the defendant suffered substantial prejudice as a result.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal citations and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b909-10\">Here, we conclude that no material variance occurred between the indictment and proof at trial. Schumaker clearly knew that Counts 1 and 2 related to crimes without a real child victim because he continuously litigated this issue before the district court, basing a number of motions on this ground, and arguing that without an actual victim the indictment was invalid. Accordingly, he fails to demonstrate that he was substantially prejudiced by this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-11\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-12\">We generally review a district court\u2019s answers to juror\u2019s questions during deliberations for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Wright, </em>392 F.3d 1269, 1279 (11th Cir.2004). Because \u201cdistrict courts have broad discretion in formulating jury instructions provided that the charge as a whole accurately reflects the law and the facts, ... we will not reverse a conviction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>on the basis of a jury charge unless the issues of law were presented inaccurately, or the charge improperly guided the jury in such a substantial way as to violate due process.\u201d <em>United States v. Prather, </em>205 F.3d 1265, 1270 (11th Cir.2000) (internal quotation marks omitted). In determining whether the court\u2019s answer was legally erroneous, we review the original and supplemental charges as a whole, and consider together the court\u2019s original charge to the jury and its answers to the jury\u2019s questions. <em>United States v. Sanfilippo, </em>581 F.2d 1152, 1154-55 (5th Cir.1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b910-4\">It is unlawful under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241(c) to cross a State line with the intent to engage in a sexual act with a person under the age of 12. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241(c). The former Fifth Circuit upheld a conviction under the Mann Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2421, based on a showing that \u201cone purpose\u201d of the defendant\u2019s trip was illicit; thus, the court rejected his contention that his immoral purpose was \u201cmerely incidental\u201d to his travel. <em>Forrest v. United States, </em>363 F.2d 348, 349-50 (5th Cir.1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b910-5\">We conclude from the record that the district court did not err by instructing the jury to disregard the language concerning \u201cmerely incidental\u201d purposes for travel when it said to focus, instead, on whether one of the purposes of Schumaker\u2019s travel was to engage in a sexual act with an individual under 12 years of age, because the two ideas describe the same notion\u2014 whether a purpose for the trip was illicit.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-6\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-7\">We review <em>de novo </em>the denial of a motion to dismiss an indictment as legally insufficient. <em>United States v. Schmitz, </em>634 F.3d 1247, 1259 (11th Cir.2011). We also review constitutional claims <em>de novo. United States v. Williams, </em>527 F.3d 1235, 1239 (11th Cir.2008). However, where a party fails to object to an issue at trial, we review for plain error. <em>United States v. Jiminez, </em>564 F.3d 1280, 1286 (11th Cir.2009). Under plain error review, \u201c[a]n appellate court may not correct an error the defendant failed to raise in the district court unless there is: (1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights.\u201d <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1298 (11th Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks omitted). When these three conditions are met, we must then determine if the error \u201cseriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). An error affects substantial rights if it has a \u201csubstantial influence on the outcome of a case or leave[s] grave doubt as to whether [it] affected the outcome of a case.\u201d <em>United States v. Turner, </em>474 F.3d 1265, 1276 (11th Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b910-10\">Convictions for aggravated sexual abuse, under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241(c), and attempted enticement, under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2422(b), do not require the existence of an actual child victim. <em>See United States v. Farley, </em>607 F.3d 1294, 1325 (11th Cir.2010), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 131 S.Ct. 369, 178 L.Ed.2d 238 (2010) (addressing conviction for attempted enticement). Those caught in \u201csting\u201d operations and charged under \u00a7 2241(c) or \u00a7 2422(b) are subject to the same convictions and penalties as those who succeed in their crimes. <em>Id. </em>at 1322 n. 15, 1325. \u201cUnder the prior panel precedent rule, we are bound by earlier panel holdings ... unless and until they are overruled en banc or by the Supreme Court.\u201d <em>United States v. Smith, </em>122 F.3d 1355, 1359 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b910-13\">We have specifically held that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2422(b) does not exceed Congress\u2019 power under the commerce clause. <em>United States v. Hornaday, </em>392 F.3d 1306, 1310-11 (11th Cir.2004). We have noted that the internet is \u201can instrumentality of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>interstate commerce,\u201d and that Congress \u201chas the power to regulate the internet\u201d and \u201cto prohibit its use for harmful or immoral purposes regardless of whether those purposes would have a primarily intrastate impact.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1311.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\">We have also held that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2422(b) is not unconstitutionally over-broad as applied to a case involving a defendant speaking to an undercover agent posing as the parent of a fictitious child, when the defendant attempts to arrange sexual abuse through the conversation. <em>Farley, </em>607 F.3d at 1324. In so doing, we stated that \u201c[s]peech attempting to arrange the sexual abuse of children is no more constitutionally protected than speech attempting to arrange any other type of crime.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). We have held that \u00a7 2422(b) is not unconstitutionally vague, and that the terms of the statute \u2014 including \u201centice,\u201d \u201cinduce,\u201d and \u201csexual activity for which any person can be charged with a criminal offense\u201d \u2014 have plain and ordinary meanings, the statute is not unconstitutionally vague, and the scienter requirement of the statute ensures that only those who knowingly engage in proscribed conduct are subject to prosecution. <em>United States v. Panfil, </em>338 F.3d 1299, 1301 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b911-6\">We conclude from the record that the district court did not err by allowing trial to proceed on Counts 1 and 2 in the absence of any child victim. Convictions under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2241(c) and 2422(b), do not require the existence of an actual child victim, and those caught in sting operations are equally culpable as those who are successful in their criminal sexual behavior. <em>Farley, </em>607 F.3d at 1325. The prior panel precedent rule forecloses reconsideration of this issue. <em>Smith, </em>122 F.3d at 1359.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-7\">Before the district court, Schu-maker failed to argue that Counts 1 and 2 violated the Tenth Amendment, so we review his claims in this regard for plain error. Schumaker\u2019s citation to the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Bond v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 131 S.Ct. 2355, 180 L.Ed.2d 269 (2011), is inapplicable, because in <em>Bond </em>the Supreme Court decided that individuals had standing to challenge statutes under the Tenth Amendment, not that any statute at issue in the case was a violation of the Tenth Amendment. No decision of the Supreme Court or this Court supports Schumaker\u2019s argument that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2241(c) or 2422(b) violates the Tenth Amendment. To the contrary, we have specifically held that \u00a7 2422(b) does not violate the Tenth Amendment, with reasoning equally applicable to \u00a7 2241(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b911-11\">Finally, the district court did not err by denying Schumaker\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal on the grounds that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241(c) was unconstitutionally overbroad or vague. Similar to the Tenth Amendment argument noted above, we have held that \u00a7 2422(b) is neither constitutionally overbroad nor vague, with reasoning that applies equally to \u00a7 2241(c). <em>Farley, </em>607 F.3d at 1324. Therefore, we conclude that Schumaker is not entitled to relief on these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-12\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-13\">A constitutional challenge to a sentence is reviewed <em>de novo. United States v. Flores, </em>572 F.3d 1254, 1268 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b911-14\">The mandatory minimum sentence under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1) does not violate the Fifth Amendment or the separation of powers doctrine. <em>United States v. Holmes, </em>838 F.2d 1175, 1178 (11th Cir.1988). With regard to the separation of powers doctrine, \u201c[i]t is for Congress to say what shall be a crime and how that crime shall be punished.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b912-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>A 30-year sentence for violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241(c) does not violate the Eighth Amendment. <em>Farley, </em>607 F.3d at 1343-46.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-4\">We conclude that the district court did not err by sentencing Schumaker to the mandatory minimum sentence of 30 years\u2019 imprisonment on Count 1. Schumaker objected to his 30-year sentence on Count 1 based on the Eighth Amendment, the Fifth Amendment, and the separation of powers doctrine. Our binding precedent states that a 30-year sentence under \u00a7 2241(c) does not violate the Eighth Amendment. <em>Farley, </em>607 F.3d at 1343-46. Nor does it violate the Fifth Amendment or the separation of powers doctrine. <em>See Holmes, </em>838 F.2d at 1178; <em>United States v. Pope, </em>461 F.3d 1331, 1337 (11th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Willis, </em>956 F.2d 248, 250-51 (11th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b912-5\">For the aforementioned reasons, we affirm Schumaker\u2019s convictions and his 360-month total sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
