In dismissing the complaint, the district court found that the undisputed evidence established that Gonzalez had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-9\">In his brief, Gonzalez renews many of the allegations raised during the proceedings below; however, he never adequately briefs a challenge to the district court\u2019s conclusion that the evidence showed no dispute about his failure to exhaust his administrative remedies. Gonzalez has abandoned the only basis for his appeal by failing to brief a challenge to the district court\u2019s reason for dismissal. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993); <em>Brinkmann v. Dallas Cnty. Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). By failing to provide adequate briefing, he has likewise abandoned his claim that the magistrate judge and district court failed to rule on his unspecified motions and petitions. <em>See Yohey, </em>985 F.2d at 224-25. Accordingly, Gonzalez\u2019s appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See 5th </em>CiR. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-10\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of Gonzalez\u2019s \u00a7 1983 lawsuit as frivolous pursuant to \u00a7 1915A(b)(l) and our dismissal of this appeal as frivolous both count as strikes for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 388 (5th Cir.1996). Gonzalez is warned that, if he accumulates three strikes pursuant to \u00a7 1915(g), he may not proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he \u201cis under imminent danger of serious physical injury.\u201d \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-15\">APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b682-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
