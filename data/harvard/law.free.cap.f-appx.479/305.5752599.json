On appeal, Stried-inger argues that the district court erred in classifying him as a career offender, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(a), because he only had one prior felony conviction for a crime of violence, resisting arrest with violence. Specifically, Striedinger contends that the district court erred in determining that his prior conviction for throwing a deadly missile, pursuant to Fla. Stat. \u00a7 790.19, was a crime of violence because: (1) the statute as charged encompasses many acts which would not qualify as a crime of violence; (2) throwing deadly missiles does not inherently pose a serious potential risk of physical injury that is similar in degree to the risks posed by the crimes enumerated in \u00a7 4Bl.l(a)(2); and (3)the statute could be violated by a mere showing of \u201cwantonness\u201d or \u201cmaliciousness,\u201d and reckless conduct is not enough to qualify an offense as a crime of violence under \u00a7 4Bl.l(a)(2)\u2019s residual clause.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>We review <em>de novo </em>whether a prior conviction qualifies as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>United States v. Loekley, </em>632 F.3d 1238, 1240 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 132 S.Ct. 257, 181 L.Ed.2d 150 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">A defendant qualifies as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 if: (1) he was at least 18 years old at the time he committed the instant offense; (2) the instant offense is a felony that is either a crime of violence or a drug offense; and (3) he has at least two prior felony convictions for a crime of violence or a drug offense. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(a). A \u201ccrime of violence\u201d means any federal or state offense punishable by a term of imprisonment in excess of one year, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-8\">(1) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-9\">(2) is burglary of a dwelling, arson, or extortion, involves the use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b333-10\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-11\">Commentary to this guideline provides further definitional guidance:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-12\">For purposes of this guideline\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-13\">\u201cCrime of violence\u201d includes murder, manslaughter, kidnapping, aggravated assault, forcible sex offenses, robbery, arson, extortion, extortionate extension of credit, and burglary of a dwelling. Other offenses are included as \u201ccrimes of violence\u201d if (A) that offense has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another, or (B) the conduct set forth (i.e., expressly charged) in the count of which the defendant was convicted involved use of explosives ... or, by its nature, presented a serious risk of physical injury to another.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b333-16\"><em>Id., </em>comment. (n.l).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-17\">Notably, the definition of a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under \u00a7 4B1.2(a) is virtually identical to the definition of a \u201cviolent felony\u201d in the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B), and, therefore, we apply a similar analysis in deciding whether a given offense qualifies as a crime of violence or a violent felony. <em>United States v. Alexander, </em>609 F.3d 1250, 1253 (11th Cir.2010), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 131 S.Ct. 1783, 179 L.Ed.2d 656 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-20\">In assessing whether a prior conviction is a qualifying offense for purposes of a sentencing enhancement, we generally apply a \u201ccategorical approach,\u201d looking no further than the statutory definition of the offense and the judgment of conviction. <em>United States v. Palomino Garcia, </em>606 F.3d 1317, 1336 (11th Cir.2010). However, when the statute is ambiguous \u2014 covering conduct that constitutes a crime of violence, as well as conduct that does not \u2014 we employ a \u201cmodified categorical approach,\u201d examining the facts underlying the conviction in order to determine the statutory basis for the conviction. <em>Id. </em>at 1336-37. In doing so, we may consult \u201cany charging documents, the written plea agreement, the transcript of the plea colloquy, and any explicit factual finding by the trial judge to which the defendant assented.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1337.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-21\">In <em>Begay v. United States, </em>the Supreme Court considered the scope of felonies that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>fall into the ACCA\u2019s residual category of crimes that \u201cotherwise involve conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d <em>Begay v. United States, </em>553 U.S. 137, 143-45, 128 S.Ct. 1581, 1585-86, 170 L.Ed.2d 490 (2008); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). The Supreme Court held that the residual category only encompasses crimes \u201croughly similar, in kind as well as in degree of risk posed,\u201d to the enumerated crimes of burglary, arson, extortion, or crimes involving the use of explosives. <em>Begay, </em>553 U.S. at 143, 128 S.Ct. at 1585. The Court noted that those offenses \u201call typically involve purposeful, violent, and aggressive conduct,\u201d and that they \u201cshow an increased likelihood that the offender is the kind of person who might deliberately point [a] gun and pull the trigger.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 144-46, 128 S.Ct. at 1586-87 (quotations omitted). The Court examined whether driving under the influence was akin to the enumerated examples and held that, rather than involving \u201cviolent, aggressive, and purposeful\u201d conduct, it was a strict liability crime. <em>Id. </em>at 148, 128 S.Ct. at 1588. Therefore, the offense was not a violent felony. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">In <em>Sykes, </em>the Supreme Court re-examined its holding in <em>Begay </em>regarding the phrase \u201cpurposeful, violent, and aggressive,\u201d and noted that the language had no link to the statutory text of the residual clause. <em>Sykes v. United States, </em>564 U.S. \u2014, \u2014, 131 S.Ct. 2267, 2275, 180 L.Ed.2d 60 (2011). The Court further noted that <em>Begay </em>was the only relevant decision that it had issued in which \u201crisk was not the dispositive factor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The reason the inquiry into whether the conduct in <em>Begay </em>was \u201cpurposeful, violent, and aggressive\u201d was necessary was because the relevant offense was analogous to strict liability, negligence, and recklessness crimes. <em>Id. </em>at \u2014, 131 S.Ct. at 2275-76. For crimes that require a stringent <em>mens rea </em>requirement, such as \u201cknowingly or intentionally,\u201d the Court held that the only inquiry necessary in most cases will be one into the level of risk. <em>Id. </em>at \u2014, \u2014, 131 S.Ct. at 2273, 2275-76. Further, the Court held that \u201ca crime involves the requisite risk when the risk posed by the crime in question is comparable to that posed by its closest analog among the enumerated offenses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u2014, 131 S.Ct. at 2273 (alteration and quotation omitted). To determine whether the crime of vehicular flight was a crime of violence, the Court analogized the offense to burglary. The Court noted that \u201c[bjurglary is dangerous because it can end in confrontation leading to violence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Similarly, vehicular flight often involves potentially dangerous confrontations with the police, which \u201cplaces property and persons at serious risk of injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u2014, 131 S.Ct. at 2273-74.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-15\">In analyzing whether an offense poses a serious potential risk of physical injury under the categorical approach, the fact that an offense can be committed without the potential for physical injury does not automatically mean that it is outside of the scope of the residual clause. <em>James v. United States, </em>550 U.S. 192, 207-08, 127 S.Ct. 1586, 1597, 167 L.Ed.2d 532 (2007). Instead, \u201cthe proper inquiry is whether the conduct encompassed by the elements of the offense, in the ordinary case, presents a serious potential risk of injury to another.\u201d 550 U.S. at 208, 127 S.Ct. at 1597. Thus, in <em>James </em>the Supreme Court held that attempted burglary categorically qualifies as a violent felony, even though it could involve an unoccupied structure, because it generally involves a risk of confrontation and injury to a third party, whether an occupant or a bystander. <em>Id. </em>at 203-04, 207-09, 127 S.Ct. at 1594-97.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-16\">Florida law provides that a person commits a felony if he \u201cwantonly or maliciously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>... throws any missile or hurls or projects a stone or other hard substance which would produce death or great bodily harm, at, within, or in any public or private building, occupied or unoccupied,\u201d or at a vehicle, train, boat, or aircraft. Fla. Stat. \u00a7 790.19. The Florida Supreme Court has defined the statute\u2019s intent element as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-5\">\u2018Wantonly\u2019 means consciously and intentionally, with reckless indifference to consequences and with the knowledge that damage is likely to be done to some person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-6\">\u2018Maliciously\u2019 means wrongfully, intentionally, without legal justification or excuse, and with the knowledge that injury or damage will or may be caused to another person or the property of another person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b335-7\"><em>State v. Kettell, </em>980 So.2d 1061, 1067 (Fla.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-8\">A violation of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 790.19 qualifies as a crime of violence under the categorical approach because it involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another. Even if a defendant throws a missile at a structure that he believes is unoccupied, it is possible for an occupant or a bystander located outside of the structure to be struck by the missile or resulting debris and thereby injured. However, even if a violation of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 790.19 did not qualify as a crime of violence under the categorical approach, Striedinger\u2019s conviction for throwing a deadly missile would still qualify as a crime of violence under the modified categorical approach, because his charging information and acknowledgment of plea form indicated that he threw a missile into an occupied building.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-9\">Because Striedinger\u2019s conviction for throwing a deadly missile qualifies as a second conviction for a crime of violence, the district court properly classified him as a career offender for purposes of sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b332-13\">. Striedinger also asserts that the district court erred in determining that his Florida <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>conviction for battery on a law enforcement officer was a crime of violence for purposes of \u00a7 4B 1.1(a). However, it is unnecessary to resolve that issue because, as discussed <em>infra, </em>throwing a deadly missile is a crime of violence, and Striedinger does not challenge the determination that his conviction for resisting an officer with violence qualifies as a second crime of violence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
