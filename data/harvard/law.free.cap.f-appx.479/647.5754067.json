No. 111-220, 124 Stat. 2372.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-22\">Pursuant to a written plea agreement, Chappell pleaded guilty to conspiracy to distribute 50 grams or more of cocaine base. In the presentence report (PSR), the probation officer found that Chappell was responsible for the equivalent of 13,-782 kilograms of marijuana since the trafficking conduct involved both cocaine base and marijuana. <em>See </em>United States Sentencing Guidelines (USSG) \u00a7 2D1.1, cmt. n. 10. She determined his base offense level to be 36. The probation officer also determined that Chappell\u2019s base offense level was 37 under the career offender provision of the USSG \u00a7 4B1.1 because of Chappell\u2019s prior Texas convictions for aggravated rape and delivery of a controlled substance. Thus, the higher career offender range governed. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 4Bl.l(b). Applying a two-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, she calculated Chappell\u2019s total offense level at 35. Based upon Chappell\u2019s total offense level of 35 and criminal history category of VI, the probation officer determined that Chappell\u2019s guidelines sentence range was 292-365 months of imprisonment and 10 years of supervised release. The district court adopted the guidelines sentence range set forth in the PSR and sentenced Chappell to 292 months of imprisonment and 10 years of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>In 2011, the district court considered whether to reduce Chappell\u2019s sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3592(c)(2) based upon the amendments to the Guidelines that implemented the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010, which reduced the base offense levels for crack cocaine offenses and made those reductions retroactive. The district court denied relief, finding that Chappell was ineligible for a sentence reduction because he was sentenced as a career offender. Chappell timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">Citing <em>Freeman v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 131 S.Ct. 2685, 180 L.Ed.2d 519 (2011), Chappell argues that he was eligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) even though he was sentenced as a career offender. We review the district court\u2019s ruling for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 237 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying relief in this case. Our precedent holds that the guidelines amendment lowering the base offense levels for crack cocaine offenses does \u201cnot apply to prisoners sentenced as career offenders.\u201d <em>United States v. Anderson, </em>591 F.3d 789, 791 (5th Cir.2009). In <em>Anderson, </em>the defendant was assessed a higher offense level because he was determined to be a career offender and not because he had an underlying crack cocaine offense. \u201cBecause the career offender base level exceeded the general base level, the career offender sentencing range governed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 790; see <em>also </em>USSG \u00a7 4Bl.l(b) (\u201c[I]f the offense level for a career offender from the table in this subsection is greater than the offense level otherwise applicable, the offense level ... in this subsection shall apply.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b674-8\">Two years later in <em>Freeman, </em>a four-justice plurality opined that a sentence based upon a guidelines range that was subsequently lowered makes a defendant eligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) even if the defendant agreed to the sentence in a plea agreement entered into under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(c)(1)(C). <em>Freeman, </em>131 S.Ct. at 2692-93. Justice Sotomayor concurred in the plurality\u2019s opinion and opined that defendants are eligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) if the plea agreement expressly based the sentence on a guidelines range that was subsequently lowered. <em>Id. </em>at 2695 (Sotomayor, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-10\">This Court\u2019s holding in <em>Anderson </em>is consistent with <em>Freeman; </em>in <em>Anderson, </em>the defendant\u2019s sentence was based on his status as a career offender, and not on the crack cocaine offense, because the career offender base level exceeded the general base level that would otherwise have applied. <em>See Anderson, </em>591 F.3d at 790. Thus, his sentence was not \u201cbased on\u201d his crack cocaine conviction, and it would not have changed following the Fair Sentencing Act amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-11\">Likewise, Chappell was sentenced based on the career offender provision, not based on the base sentence for crack cocaine. Because the career offender provision established a base level higher than that for crack cocaine, the Fail' Sentencing Act\u2019s guidelines amendments do not affect his sentence under <em>Freeman.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b674-12\">Accordingly, the Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED, and the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. The Government\u2019s alternative motion for an extension of time in which to file a brief is DENIED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b673-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
