On appeal, Wedderburn argues that the district court committed clear error in imposing a three-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(b), after determining that Wedderburn was a supervisor or manager in the smuggling operation. We review the district court\u2019s decision to apply an aggravating role enhancement for clear error. <em>United States v. Ramirez, </em>426 F.3d 1344, 1355 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cFor a factual finding to be clearly erroneous, this Court, after reviewing all of the evidence, must be left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>United States v. Rodriguez-Lopez, </em>363 F.3d 1134, 1137 (11th Cir.2004) (quotations omitted). \u201cWhere the evidence has two possible interpretations, the district court\u2019s choice between them cannot be clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>United States v. Foster, </em>155 F.3d 1329, 1331 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b991-15\">Section 3Bl.l(b) of the Sentencing Guidelines provides for a three-level increase to a defendant\u2019s offense level if the defendant \u201cwas a manager or supervisor (but not an organizer or leader) and the criminal activity involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(b). The government bears the burden of establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, a defendant\u2019s aggravating role in the offense. <em>United States v. Yates, </em>990 F.2d 1179, 1182 (11th Cir.1993). Recruitment of co-conspirators <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"966\">*966</page-number>and arrangement for the transportation of the drugs is indicative of a managerial or supervisory role. <em>United States v. Perry, </em>340 F.3d 1216, 1217-18 (11th Cir.2003). A defendant\u2019s subordinate role to another conspirator does not absolve him of his supervisory role in coordinating and managing the delivery and transportation of a drug shipment. <em>United States v. Jones, </em>933 F.2d 1541, 1542, 1546-47 (11th Cir.1991) (upholding a \u00a7 3Bl.l(b) enhancement where the evidence showed that the defendant helped other participants \u201cplan the operational aspects of the [drug] smuggling effort,\u201d and made various unilateral decisions regarding landing and loading locations and the timing of the smuggling trips).</p>\n<p id=\"b992-4\">The district court\u2019s finding that Wedder-burn was a manager or supervisor under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(b) was supported by the record developed during an evidentiary hearing at sentencing. In response to questioning by the court, DEA Special Agent Paul Mangone summed up Wedder-burn\u2019s participation in the criminal scheme as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b992-5\">During each delivery ... Mr. Wedder-burn was always the person that was consulted. He was the one person that, when he was not there, we always made sure that we made a phone call to Jamaica, to make sure. That everyone was concerned [with] what Mr. Wedder-burn wanted to do. It was \u2014 whether it was Mr. Hanast, whether it was Mr. Finkel, or Gentry, whether it was Mr. Riddick, they always deferred, when it came to certain things, to Mr. Wedder-burn.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b992-6\">The court credited Mangone\u2019s testimony. Because the evidence showed that Wed-derburn helped direct and plan the smuggling operation, Wedderburn has not shown that the district court clearly erred in applying the three-level enhancement. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
