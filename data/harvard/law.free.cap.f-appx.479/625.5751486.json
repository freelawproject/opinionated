The district court dismissed his suit as frivolous and for failing to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, and Queen appeals that dismissal. We conduct a de novo review of the district court\u2019s decision. <em>See Green v. Atkinson, </em>623 F.3d 278, 280 (5th Cir.2010). Our analysis of Queen\u2019s arguments, the record and pertinent authority shows no error in connection with the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">One wishing to raise a viable \u00a7 1983 claim must allege that a state actor violated his Constitutional rights. <em>Cornish v. Corr. Servs. Corp., </em>402 F.3d 545, 549 (5th Cir.2005). The right of access to courts \u201cguarantees no particular methodology but rather the conferral of a capability \u2014 the capability of bringing contemplated challenges to sentences or conditions of confinement before the courts.\u201d <em>Lewis v. Casey, </em>518 U.S. 343, 356, 116 S.Ct. 2174, 135 L.Ed.2d 606 (1996). Queen complains that the defendants\u2019 actions hampered his ability to bring excessive force claims unrelated to his sentence or the conditions of his confinement. Even if his ability to bring these claims was impeded, this is but \u201cone of the incidental (and perfectly constitutional) consequences of conviction and incarceration.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 355, 116 S.Ct. 2174. Consequently, Queen failed to state a non-frivolous access to courts claim upon which relief could be granted, and he has not shown that the district court erred by dismissing his suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b651-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
