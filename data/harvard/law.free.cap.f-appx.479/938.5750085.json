We granted a certificate of appeala-bility (COA) to determine whether the district court erred when it found four of Galin\u2019s claims unexhausted and therefore procedurally barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"939\">*939</page-number>I.Background</p>\n<p id=\"b965-5\">In Florida state court, Galin was convicted by a jury of two counts and sentenced on each count to fifteen years in prison and one year of probation, to run concurrently. These convictions and sentences were summarily affirmed on direct appeal. <em>Galin v. State, </em>819 So.2d 764 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2002) (per curiam). Galin then filed a <em>pro se </em>motion for state post-conviction relief pursuant to Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.850 wherein he raised seventeen constitutional grounds for relief, including (1) ineffective assistance of trial counsel for failure to investigate the facts of the case (Claim 1); (2) ineffective assistance of trial counsel for failure to include Galin in the jury-selection process (Claim 3); (3) ineffective assistance of trial counsel for failure to impeach the victim (Claim 7); and (4) trial counsel\u2019s conflict of interest by obtaining automobile assistance from the victim\u2019s relative, who was an automobile mechanic (Claim 8). The state court granted an evidentiary hearing on several of the claims raised in his Rule 3.850 motion, but not on the claims recited above. Following the evidentiary hearing, the state postconviction court denied relief on all claims. Through counsel, Galin appealed the denial. As regards the four claims listed above, Galin argued that the trial court erred in failing to grant an evidentiary hearing. The state appellate court summarily affirmed the denial of his postconviction relief. <em>Galin v. State, </em>919 So.2d 444 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2005) (per cu-riam).</p>\n<p id=\"b965-6\">Galin filed a <em>pro se </em>\u00a7 2254 petition in federal district court raising thirty-one grounds for relief, including the claims he raised in his Rule 3.850 motion as claims 1, 3, 7, and 8 (renumbered in his habeas petition as 5, 7, 12, and 11, respectively). The district court found these four claims unexhausted, reasoning that Galin only challenged the state trial court\u2019s denial of an evidentiary hearing rather than the denial of the substance of his claims in his state postconviction appeal. Because the district court found these claims unex-hausted, it dismissed them as procedurally barred. We granted a COA to determine whether the district court erred when it found claims 5, 7, 11, and 12 of Galin\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition unexhausted.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-8\">II.Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b965-9\">When considering the district court\u2019s denial of a habeas petition, we conduct a <em>de novo </em>review of questions of law and mixed questions of law and fact. <em>Nyland v. Moore, </em>216 F.3d 1264, 1266 (11th Cir.2000) (per curiam). We review the district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error. <em>Id. </em>The district court\u2019s conclusion as to whether a petitioner exhausted his state court remedies is a mixed question of law and fact, and as such we review it <em>de novo. Fox v. Kelso, </em>911 F.2d 563, 568 (11th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b965-10\">III.Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b965-11\">Federal habeas relief is available to correct only those custodial injuries resulting from violations of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(a). Before filing a federal habeas petition, a state prisoner must exhaust state court remedies, either on direct appeal or in a state postconviction motion. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b), (c). To exhaust state remedies, the petitioner must fairly present every issue raised in his federal petition to the state\u2019s highest court, either on direct appeal or on collateral review. <em>Mason v. Allen, </em>605 F.3d 1114, 1119 (11th Cir.2010) (per curiam) (citing <em>Castille v. Peoples, </em>489 U.S. 346, 351, 109 S.Ct. 1056, 1060, 103 L.Ed.2d 380 (1989)).</p>\n<p id=\"b965-12\">Exhaustion does not require a petitioner to raise more in a state appellate court than could reasonably be granted by that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"940\">*940</page-number>court. <em>Henry v. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>197 F.3d 1361, 1368 (11th Cir.1999). Where, as in Florida, \u201cstate procedure makes it appropriate for a petitioner to request an evi-dentiary hearing\u201d on appeal before arguing the merits of his case and requesting a new trial, \u201cthe difference between a request for an evidentiary hearing in state court and a request for a federal writ under \u00a7 2254 ... is not enough to render a petitioner\u2019s constitutional claims unex-hausted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1367.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-4\">Under Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.850, a defendant is permitted to file a postconviction motion to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence if the judgment was entered or the sentence imposed in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States or the State of Florida. Fla. R.Crim. P. 3.850(a)(1). Rule 3.850 requires the state court to determine whether an evidentiary hearing is required or whether the motion may be denied without a hearing. Fla. R.Crim. P. 3.850(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b966-5\"><em>Henry </em>is instructive here. There, the petitioner raised two claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel in his Rule 3.850 motion and on appeal alleged error in the postconviction court\u2019s failure to hold an evidentiary hearing. <em>Henry, </em>197 F.3d at 1363. In Henry\u2019s \u00a7 2254 habeas petition, he raised the same ineffective assistance of counsel allegations he raised in his initial Rule 3.850 motion, and the district court found those claims procedurally barred because he failed to exhaust his claims in state court. <em>Id. </em>There, we determined that under Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.850, a state court appeal requesting only an evidentiary hearing sufficed to have exhausted Henry\u2019s claims in state court for the purposes of \u00a7 2254. <em>Id. </em>at 1368.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-6\">Our holding in <em>Henry </em>makes clear that failure to raise substantive arguments when appealing a Florida court\u2019s denial of an evidentiary hearing on a Rule 3.850 motion does not render a claim unexhaust-ed. <em>Id. </em>at 1367-68. Galin\u2019s appellate Rule 3.850 brief sets forth a factual basis for his claims and a legal argument as to why he was entitled to an evidentiary hearing. We therefore find that his claims were properly exhausted in state court, and the district court erred in denying those claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-8\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
