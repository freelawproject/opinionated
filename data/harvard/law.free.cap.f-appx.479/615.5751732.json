Gonzalez was sentenced to 70 months of imprisonment and five years of supervised release, and Garcia was sentenced to 63 months of imprisonment and five years of supervised release. They both contend that the district court clearly erred by imposing the enhancement for obstruction of justice in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1 on the grounds that they committed perjury by falsely testifying at their joint trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-24\">\u201cIn order to apply an enhancement [for obstruction of justice], the district court must find evidence supporting the enhancement to a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Anderson, </em>560 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>F.3d 275, 283 (5th Cir.2009). We review the district court\u2019s finding of obstruction of justice for clear error. <em>United States v. Powers, </em>168 F.3d 741, 752 (5th Cir.1999). \u201cA factual finding is not clearly erroneous as long as it is plausible in the light of the record as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">Section 3C1.1 of the Sentencing Guidelines provides for a two-level increase \u201c[i]f (1) the defendant willfully obstructed or impeded, or attempted to obstruct or impede, the administration of justice with respect to the ... prosecution ... of the instant offense of conviction, and (2) the obstructive conduct related to (A) the defendant\u2019s offense of conviction.... \u201d \u00a7 3C1.1. The enhancement is warranted if the defendant \u201cgives false testimony concerning a material matter with the willful intent to provide false testimony, rather than as a result of confusion, mistake, or faulty memory.\u201d <em>United States v. Dunnigan, </em>507 U.S. 87, 94, 113 S.Ct. 1111, 122 L.Ed.2d 445 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">The district court found that both Gonzalez and Garcia falsely testified that there was a sixth person guiding them through the desert. These findings are plausible in light of the record as a whole. <em>See Powers, </em>168 F.3d at 752. The agents apprehended five people, the same number of people that they observed during surveillance, and testified that they would have been able to detect a sixth person in the area with an infrared camera. Also, the agents observed one of the five persons appearing to act as a guide by signaling to the other four when to proceed and by scouting an area before proceeding. The agents did not observe the signals that the guide allegedly left for the defendants, such as stacks of rocks. In addition, one agent testified that it would not have been feasible for the guide to lead the defendants at night while staying ahead of the defendants given that the agents had trouble tracking the subjects even though they were using night-vision goggles and knew where the subjects went.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">While it was possible that a sixth person escaped undetected, there was no evidence corroborating the defendants\u2019 testimony that a sixth person existed, and the agents\u2019 testimony indicated that it was unlikely that a sixth person existed and was able to guide the defendants in the manner described by the defendants. Therefore, the mere possibility that the guide could have escaped undetected does not render the district court\u2019s findings implausible in light of the record as a whole. This is especially true given that the district court presided over the trial and was, therefore, able to evaluate Gonzalez\u2019s and Garcia\u2019s credibility. See id. at 752-53.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">Gonzalez and Garcia also rely on the jury note to challenge the district court\u2019s findings. The jury asked the district court whether they needed to deliberate on the other elements of the duress defense if they all agreed that there was insufficient evidence to support the second element. The second element was whether the defendants had recklessly or negligently placed themselves in a situation in which it was probable that they would be forced to choose to commit criminal conduct. The other elements of the duress defense were whether the defendants were threatened with harm, whether the defendants had no reasonable legal alternative to violating the law, and whether a reasonable person would have believed that he would avoid the harm by committing the criminal action.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-9\">Gonzalez and Garcia argue that the jury-note indicates that the jury believed the defendants\u2019 testimony regarding the duress but nonetheless found that the testimony was insufficient to excuse criminal liability. It is speculative to infer based on the note that some or all of the jurors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>believed the defendants\u2019 testimony. Further, the mere possibility that the jurors believed the defendants\u2019 testimony does not render the district court\u2019s findings implausible in light of the record as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">Because the record as a whole supports the district court\u2019s findings that Gonzalez and Garcia committed perjury, the imposition of a two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice was not clearly erroneous. <em>See id. </em>at 752.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">The district court\u2019s judgments are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b641-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
