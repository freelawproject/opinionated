Smith argues that the denial of the motion has resulted in an above-guidelines sentence, even though he was initially sentenced within the Sentencing Guidelines. We review the district court\u2019s decision for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-21\">In this case, the district court determined that Smith was eligible for a reduction in sentence based on Amendment 750 of the Sentencing Guidelines; however, the court concluded that a reduction was not appropriate due to Smith\u2019s misconduct while incarcerated. <em>See Dillon v. United </em>States, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, \u2014, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2691, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010). The district court properly considered Smith\u2019s post-sentencing conduct in determining whether to grant relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment, (n. 1(B)(iii)); <em>United States v. Larry, </em>632 F.3d 933, 936 (5th Cir.2011). Moreover, the court had no obligation to grant such relief. <em>See Evans, </em>587 F.3d at 673-74.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-24\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b678-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
