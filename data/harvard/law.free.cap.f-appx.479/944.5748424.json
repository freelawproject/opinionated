O\u2019Neill, U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office, Tampa, FL, for Plaintiff-Appellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b971-10\">Jonathan White, Coleman, FL, pro se.</attorneys>\n<judges data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b971-13\">Before EDMONDSON, BARKETT and PRYOR, Circuit Judges.</judges>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b971-14\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b971-15\">Jonathan White, a federal prisoner proceeding <em>pro se, </em>appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion requesting that his 262-month sentence, imposed for crack possession, be reduced. Specifically, White argues that the district court had jurisdiction to amend his sentence in light of Amendment 750<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to the Sentencing Guidelines, which reduced the base offense levels corresponding to crack possession, and in light of the congressional intent behind the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010, Pub.L. No. 111-220 (\u201cFSA\u201d), which indicated that Congress believed the penalties for crack possession offenses were too high.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-16\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions, in a \u00a7 3582 proceeding, regarding the scope of its authority under the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1326 (11th Cir.2008). Under \u00a7 3582(c), the district court \u201cmay not modify a term of imprisonment once it has been imposed except ... (2) in the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c). A modification is permitted only \u201cif such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The Sentencing Guidelines, in a policy statement, note that a reduction in sentence as the result of an amended guideline range is not proper if the \u201camendment ... does not have the effect of lowering <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"946\">*946</page-number>the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B). Similarly, no reduction is warranted where \u201cthe amendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range because of the operation of another guideline.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(A)).</p>\n<p id=\"b972-4\">In <em>Moore, </em>we addressed the issue of whether Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines (which similarly reduced the base offense levels for crack possession offenses) authorized reductions under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for defendants who had been convicted of crack possession offenses, but had been sentenced under the career offender guidelines. <em>See Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1325. We held that the language of \u00a7 3582(e)(2) only authorizes reductions to sentences that were \u201cbased on\u201d sentencing ranges that were subsequently lowered. <em>Id. </em>at 1327. As Amendment 706 lowered the base offense levels for crack possession, but not the base offense levels under the career offender sentencing scheme, we found that it did not lower the sentencing range upon which a career offender\u2019s sentence had been based. <em>Id. </em>We also discussed U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(A)), and noted that it \u201c[made] clear\u201d that a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction was not warranted where an amendment lowers a defendant\u2019s base offense levels for the offense of conviction, but not the career offender sentencing range under which the defendant was sentenced. <em>Id. </em>at 1327-28.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-5\">Here, Amendment 750 lowered the base offense levels for crack possession offenses, but did not affect the career offender guideline calculations. Thus, because White was sentenced under the career offender guideline calculations, Amendment 750 did not lower White\u2019s applicable sentencing range and did not grant the district court jurisdiction to modify White\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Similarly, while the FSA expresses an intent to lower the penalties imposed for crack possession offenses, it shows no such intent towards the penalties for career offenders.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b971-12\">. Effective November 1, 2011, Amendment 750 increased the quantities of crack cocaine necessary to trigger certain statutory minimum sentencing requirements. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 750 (2011). Amendment 750 also lowered the base offense levels corresponding to most crack possession offenses. <em>See id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
