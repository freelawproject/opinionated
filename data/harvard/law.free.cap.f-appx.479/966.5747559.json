The IJ\u2019s order denied Villalobos\u2019s \u201cMotion to Reconsider and Reopen\u201d her removal proceedings. No reversible error has been shown; we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-11\">After being charged as removable, Villa-lobos filed an application for adjustment of status. She asserted that her husband was an alien adjusted under the Cuban Adjustment Act of 1966. Following an individual hearing, the IJ denied Villalo-bos\u2019s application. Villalobos failed to appeal the IJ\u2019s denial to the BIA.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b993-12\">Instead, Villalobos filed a \u201cMotion to Reconsider and Reopen\u201d with the IJ. In support of her motion to reconsider, Villa-lobos asserted that she had demonstrated that her marriage was legitimate. And she based her motion to reopen on changed circumstances in Venezuela. Vil-lalobos\u2019s motion did not state expressly that she wished to apply for asylum, but she alleged that she had indicated at her individual hearing that she feared returning to Venezuela. She also attached an incomplete asylum application in which she described the persecution that she and her family allegedly had suffered under the Hugo Chavez regime.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-15\">The IJ denied Villalobos\u2019s motion to reopen, concluding that she had failed to demonstrate changed circumstances. The IJ did not address Villalobos\u2019s motion to reconsider. Villalobos appealed to the BIA, arguing for the first time that the IJ violated her due process rights by denying her request \u2014 made allegedly at her individual hearing \u2014 for additional time to file an asylum application. Villalobos failed to challenge the IJ\u2019s determination that she had not demonstrated changed circumstances warranting reopening or the IJ\u2019s failure to address her motion to reconsider.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-16\">The BIA affirmed the denial of Villalo-bos\u2019s motion to reopen and dismissed her appeal. The BIA noted that \u201c[ijnasmuch as the motion was filed for the purpose of applying for new relief from removal, the [IJ] correctly treated it as a motion to reopen.\u201d The BIA then concluded that Villalobos provided no evidence to support her motion to reopen because the only statement she provided was unsigned, unaccompanied by a certificate of translation, and failed to address the claim raised in the motion to reopen. The BIA also noted that Villalobos\u2019s argument that the IJ committed a legal error in denying her request <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"968\">*968</page-number>for additional time to apply for asylum was not a proper subject for a motion to reopen and should have been raised in a direct appeal to the BIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-4\">In her petition for review, Villalobos reasserts only her due process claim. Vil-lalobos fails to challenge the BIA\u2019s determination that her \u201cMotion to Reconsider or Reopen\u201d should be construed only as a motion to reopen. She also fails to challenge the BIA\u2019s determinations that she failed to provide evidence to support her motion to reopen or that her due process claim was not a proper subject for a motion to reopen. Thus, those issues are abandoned. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005). Moreover, because Villalobos failed to raise her due process claim either in a direct appeal to the BIA or in her initial \u201cMotion to Reconsider or Reopen,\u201d she has not exhausted this claim; and we lack jurisdiction to review it. <em>See Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247,1251 (11th Cir.2006) (concluding that, pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1), we lack jurisdiction to consider procedural due process claims raised in a petition for review unless the petitioner has exhausted her administrative remedies).</p>\n<p id=\"b994-6\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b993-13\"> As a result, a transcript of Villalobos\u2019s individual merits hearing before the IJ was never prepared.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
