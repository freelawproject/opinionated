First, he argues that the district court clearly erred in overruling his <em>Batson </em>objection. Second, he argues that the court abused its discretion in removing an empaneled juror due to his prior knowledge of the underlying investigation. Third, he argues that the court\u2019s supplemental jury instruction was erroneous. Fourth, he argues that the magistrate judge erred in denying his motion to sever the counts in the indictment. Fifth, he argues that the court erred in applying the armed career criminal statutory sentencing enhancement. Sixth and finally, he argues that the court clearly erred in refusing to apply an acceptance of responsibility sentence reduction and thereby punished him for going to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-17\">A district court\u2019s resolution of a <em>Batson </em>objection that turns on credibility is entitled to great deference and is reviewed only for clear error. <em>United States v. Hill, </em>643 F.3d 807, 837-38 (11th Cir.2011). \u201cA district court\u2019s findings regarding whether a peremptory strike was exercised for a discriminatory reason largely involve credibility determinations and are therefore entitled to great deference.\u201d <em>United States v. Novaton, </em>271 F.3d 968, 1001 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-18\">Under the Equal Protection Clause, the government may not \u201cchallenge potential jurors solely on account of their race or on the assumption that black jurors as a group will be unable impartially to consider the [government\u2019s case against a black defendant.\u201d <em>Batson v. Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>79, 89, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 1719, 90 L.Ed.2d 69 (1986). The district court applies a three-step analysis in evaluating equal protection challenges to the government\u2019s use of peremptory strikes. <em>Hill, </em>648 F.3d at 837. First, a defendant must make a <em>prima facie </em>showing of purposeful discrimination based upon a prohibited ground. <em>Id. </em>Second, upon such a showing, the government must articulate a nondiscriminatory explanation for the challenge. <em>Id. </em>Third, the trial court must determine if the defendant established purposeful discrimination. <em>Id. </em>Throughout, the ultimate burden of persuasion rests with the defendant. <em>Id. </em>Generally, the defendant must show that the government attempted to exclude \u201cas many black persons as it could from the jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 839.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">We generally will not address an argument, raised for the first time on appeal, that \u201cthere were similarly situated white venire members whom the prosecution did not strike.\u201d <em>United States v. Houston, </em>456 F.3d 1328, 1338 (11th Cir.2006). The record on appeal would likely be insufficient to consider such an argument, and the district court is not required to <em>sua sponte </em>\u201cdraw comparisons that no party asked it to draw.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1339.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">Here, even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that Walker made out a <em>prima facie </em>case below, the district court did not clearly err in overruling Walker\u2019s <em>Batson </em>challenge. The government articulated legitimate race-neutral reasons for its peremptory challenges \u2014 namely, that the first prospective juror was unemployed, and the second was not dressed appropriately for court and had not received a high school diploma. The court properly relied on its independent observations of both the prosecutor and the challenged jurors in determining that the government\u2019s proffered explanations were credible, and nothing in the record suggests otherwise. Three black venire members were not challenged by the prosecutor. Insofar as Walker now argues that there were similarly situated white jurors who were not challenged by the prosecution, this argument was not before the district court, the record is otherwise silent, and we will not address it on appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b357-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-11\">A district court\u2019s decision to remove a juror is reviewed only for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Augustin, </em>661 F.3d 1105, 1129 (11th Cir.2011). The court may excuse a juror and replace him with an alternate if, prior to deliberations, the juror is found to be \u201cunable\u201d or \u201cdisqualified\u201d to perform his duties. <em>United States v. Fajardo, </em>787 F.2d 1523, 1525 (11th Cir.1986). Absent a showing of bias or prejudice to the defendant, we will not disturb the district court\u2019s decision. <em>United States v. De La Vega, </em>913 F.2d 861, 869 (11th Cir.1990). Prejudice includes discharge of a juror without factual support or for a legally irrelevant reason. <em>Id. </em>The trial judge \u201cdoes not need a defendant\u2019s consent to replace a juror with an alternate before the jury retires; all that is required is a reasonable cause for the replacement.\u201d <em>Fajardo, </em>787 F.2d at 1526.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b358-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>Here, the district court did not abuse its discretion in removing the juror. After opening statements, the juror said that he was familiar with the underlying undercover investigation. Specifically, two of his restaurant\u2019s former employees frequented the storefront to buy cigarettes and, following the arrests, had told him that their friends were \u201cset up\u201d in \u201can entrapment type thing.\u201d Although the juror ultimately said that he would base his verdict solely on the evidence presented at trial, he had initially stated that he was unsure if he would be able to set aside this prior information. The court, based on its own observations of the juror during questioning, found that he was incapable of disregarding the prior information and deliberating impartially. We find no abuse of discretion in the court\u2019s decision to excuse a juror who had previous knowledge of some of the facts underlying Walker\u2019s ease. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">We ordinarily review for abuse of discretion the district court\u2019s response to questions from the jury. <em>United States v. Phaknikone, </em>605 F.3d 1099, 1107 (11th Cir.2010). Additionally, a district court\u2019s refusal to give a requested instruction is generally reversible error only where (1) the requested instruction was a correct statement of the law, (2) its subject matter was not substantially covered by other instructions, and (3) the failure to give the requested instruction seriously impaired the defendant\u2019s ability to defend himself. <em>United States v. Carrasco, </em>381 F.3d 1237, 1242 (11th Cir.2004). There generally is a \u201cstrong presumption\u201d that jurors follow instructions given to them by the district court. <em>See Hill, </em>643 F.3d at 829.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">Here, Walker did not object to the district court\u2019s supplemental instruction. Although we review this objection only for plain error, <em>see United States v. Chisholm, </em>73 F.3d 304, 307 (11th Cir.1996), we find no error at all by the district court. The court expressly instructed the jury to consider the supplemental instruction along with all the previously given charges, and nothing in the record casts any doubt on the \u201cstrong\u201d presumption that the jury followed its instructions. <em>See Hill, </em>643 F.3d at 829.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-9\">Walker contends that the magistrate and district court erred by not granting Walker\u2019s motion to sever his charges. We will reverse only where the district court abused its discretion and the defendant suffered compelling prejudice. <em>United States v. Hersh, </em>297 F.3d 1233, 1243 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-10\">It seems unlikely that Walker properly objected to the magistrate\u2019s findings, <em>see </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 59(a); <em>United States v. Schultz, </em>565 F.3d 1353, 1360 (11th Cir.2009), but even addressing the merits, we find no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s decision. The underlying facts of the three transactions overlapped significantly with one another, and conducting separate trials would clash significantly with our interest in judicial economy and administration. <em>See United States v. Kopituk, </em>690 F.2d 1289, 1318 (11th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-11\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-12\">We review <em>de novo </em>questions of statutory interpretation, including whether offenses count as separate felonies for purposes of the enhanced sentence provision of the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d). <em>United States v. Lee, </em>208 F.3d 1306, 1307 (11th Cir.2000). Under the ACCA, a defendant is subject to a fifteen-year statutory minimum sentence where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>he both violated 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) and has three prior convictions for a violent felony or serious drug offense, \u201ccommitted on occasions different from one another.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">Generally, burglary constitutes a violent felony for purposes of the ACCA. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). The district court, in applying the provisions of the ACCA to a prior conviction to which the defendant pleaded guilty, should generally look only to \u201cthe terms of the charging document, the terms of a plea agreement or transcript of colloquy between judge and defendant in which the factual basis for the plea was confirmed by the defendant, or to some comparable judicial record of this information.\u201d <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 26, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 1263, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005); <em>United States v. Sneed, </em>600 F.3d 1326, 1332-33 (11th Cir.2010) (ruling that <em>Shepard </em>also limits the evidence that the court can consider in determining whether the underlying crimes occurred on different occasions).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">As long as the predicate crimes were successive rather than simultaneous, \u201cthey constitute separate criminal episodes for purposes of the ACCA.\u201d <em>Lee, </em>208 F.3d at 1307. Crimes are \u201csuccessive\u201d where they were separated by a meaningful opportunity to desist the criminal activity and reflected \u201cdistinct aggressions,\u201d particularly where the defendant committed the crimes in different places. <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">Here, the district court did not err in applying the armed career criminal sentence enhancement under the ACCA. Walker\u2019s prior indictment alleged that the burglaries occurred at four different storage units located at two different addresses. None of the burglaries could have been committed simultaneously. <em>See United States v. Pope, </em>132 F.3d 684, 692 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-9\">Indeed, Walker does not dispute this conclusion. Rather, he argues only that he might have been convicted for being an accessory after the fact, rather than for being the principal perpetrator of the four burglaries. Walker provides no <em>Shepard </em>documents to support this bald assertion. <em>See Sneed, </em>600 F.3d at 1332-33. The indictments for all four counts of burglary stated that Walker \u201cwithout authority and with the intent to commit a theft therein, entered a building.\u201d The district court did not err by relying on these <em>Shepard </em>documents to conclude that Walker was the perpetrator of the underlying burglaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-10\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-11\">We have held that, \u201c[bjecause demonstration of whether or not the defendant has personally accepted responsibility for his criminal conduct requires a consideration of both objective factors and subjective considerations of the defendant\u2019s demeanor and sincerity, the district court\u2019s determination will not be overturned unless it is without foundation.\u201d <em>United States v. Castillo-Valencia, </em>917 F.2d 494, 500 (11th Cir.1990). Although a defendant cannot be punished by a more severe sentence because he exercised his constitutional right to proceed to trial, the simple fact that he \u201cwas given a longer sentence after trial than he might well have received had he plea bargained is not sufficient to show that he was penalized for going to trial.\u201d <em>Cole v. Wainwright, </em>614 F.2d 67, 69 (5th Cir.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-12\">Section 3E1.1 of the Guidelines states that the offense level is decreased by two points if the defendant \u201cclearly demonstrates acceptance of responsibility for his offense.\u201d U.S.S.G \u00a7 3El.l(a). The commentary to \u00a7 3E1.1 explains that the adjustment \u201cis not intended to apply to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>defendant who puts the government to its burden of proof at trial by denying the essential factual elements of guilt, is convicted, and only then admits guilt and expresses remorse.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, cmt. 2. \u201cSection 3El.l(a) is not a punishment; rather, the reduction for acceptance of responsibility is a reward for those defendants who express genuine remorse for their criminal conduct.\u201d <em>United States v. Carroll, </em>6 F.3d 735, 740 (11th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">However, there are \u201crare situations\u201d where a defendant who proceeded to trial could qualify for a downward adjustment, such as where a defendant went to trial \u201cto assert and preserve issues that do not relate to factual guilt <em>(e.g., </em>to make a constitutional challenge to a statute or a challenge to the applicability of a statute to his conduct).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 741. Additionally, a defendant is not barred as a matter of law from receiving the adjustment \u201cmerely because he asserted an entrapment defense at trial, even though some courts have viewed the assertion of an entrapment defense as the virtual antithesis of acceptance of responsibility.\u201d <em>Joiner v. United States, </em>103 F.3d 961, 963 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">Here, the district court did not clearly err in refusing to apply an aecep-tance-of-responsibility sentence reduction. The court found, in light of all the facts and circumstances, that Walker had not displayed any \u201cindication of contrition.\u201d Rather, Walker had proceeded to trial where he argued, among other things, that the undercover ATF agents induced him to sell and that someone else had cut the barrel of a shotgun that he sold to the agents. Additionally, unobjected-to facts in the presentence investigation report alleged that Walker declined to cooperate with the probation officer even after his convictions at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">Finally, nothing indicates that the court imposed a total 225-month sentence to punish Walker for exercising his right to trial. To the contrary, the court explicitly stated that Walker\u2019s sentence was in no way affected by his choice to go to trial, but instead reflected the seriousness of his criminal history and his personal circumstances. <em>See Carroll, </em>6 F.3d at 740.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b357-7\">. In any event, we find no merit to this contention.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b357-8\">. Walker cites the standard for striking a juror when the jury has already begun deliberations. In that situation, we apply a more stringent standard because of the danger that a dissenting juror may be excused based on the court's \"mistaken view that the juror is engaging in impermissible nullification.\u201d <em>Augustin, </em>661 F.3d at 1129. However, as Walker acknowledges, the juror in this case was excused well before deliberations, and thus the heightened standard is not applicable here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
