The BIA concluded that Bedoya was statutorily ineligible for cancellation of removal because he had not shown that he had not been convicted of an aggravated felony, namely, a fraud offense for which the loss to the victim exceeded $10,000. In reaching' its conclusion, the BIA relied upon a restitution order entered against Bedoya for $38,538, stemming from his convictions for one count of second-degree theft, one count of fraudulent use of a credit card for $100 or more, two counts of forgery of a check, and two counts of uttering a forged instrument or check.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-12\">On appeal, Bedoya argues that: (1) the BIA erred in combining the losses that resulted from two separate offenses of uttering of a forged instrument in order to reach the $10,000 threshold; (2) none of the convictions to which he pled guilty resulted in a loss over $10,000; (3) he was eligible for cancellation of removal; and (4) in the alternative, we should apply the \u201crule of lenity\u201d and resolve in his favor the ambiguity about whether the agency statutorily was permitted to combine loss amounts in cases like his. After thorough review, we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-13\">We review <em>de novo </em>whether we have jurisdiction to consider a petition for review. <em>Ruiz v. Gonzales, </em>479 F.3d 762, 765 (11th Cir.2007). We review also <em>de novo </em>the BIA\u2019s legal determinations. <em>Castillo-Arias v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>446 F.3d 1190, 1195 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>We review only the decision of the BIA, except to the extent that the BIA expressly adopted the opinion of the IJ. <em>Kazemzadeh v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>577 F.3d 1341, 1350 (11th Cir.2009). Because the BIA here did not expressly adopt the IJ\u2019s decision, we will review only the BIA\u2019s order. <em>See id.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">As an initial matter, we must determine whether we have jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s removal order. We lack jurisdiction to review a final order of removal when, <em>inter alia, </em>the alien is inadmissible for having committed two crimes of moral turpitude for which a sentence of one year or longer may be imposed, as provided in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(ii). <em>8 U.S.G. </em>\u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C). When the bar to review under \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C) is implicated, \u201cwe retain jurisdiction to determine whether the statutory conditions for limiting judicial review exist.\u201d <em>Keungne v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>561 F.3d 1281, 1283 (11th Cir.2009). That is, we must determine whether a petitioner is \u201c(1) an alien; (2) who is removable; (3) based on having committed a disqualifying offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted). If these conditions are met, \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C) divests us of jurisdiction to review the removal order. <em>See id. </em>at 1284. Section 1252(a)(2)(C) divests us of jurisdiction if the alien \u201cdoes not contest that he is an alien removable for prior disqualifying crimes.\u201d <em>Camacho-Salinas v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>460 F.3d 1343, 1346 (11th Cir.2006). However, even if the jurisdictional bar of \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C) applies, we still retain jurisdiction to consider constitutional challenges and \u201cquestions of law\u201d arising out of the alien\u2019s removal proceedings. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">In this case, we lack jurisdiction under \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C) to consider the BIA\u2019s final order of removal because Bedo-ya has not contested that he is an alien who is removable for having committed two disqualifying crimes involving moral turpitude. Nevertheless, we retain jurisdiction under \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D) to consider the BIA\u2019s non-discretionary legal determination that Bedoya was statutorily ineligible for cancellation of removal since he had not shown that he was not an aggravated felon.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-9\">That said, we find no merit to Bedoya\u2019s claim that the agency erred in determining that Bedoya was statutorily ineligible for cancellation of removal. The Attorney General has discretion to cancel the removal of an otherwise inadmissible or de-portable alien if the alien \u201c(1) has been ... lawfully admitted for permanent residence for not less than 5 years, (2) has resided in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>the United States continuously for 7 years after having been admitted in any status, and (3) has not been convicted of any aggravated felony.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(a). The burden of proof is on the alien to show that he satisfies the applicable eligibility requirements for relief from removal and is entitled to a favorable exercise of discretion. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1240.8(d). \u201cIf the evidence indicates that one or more of the grounds for mandatory denial of the application for relief may apply, the alien shall have the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that such grounds do not apply.\u201d <em>Id. </em>An \u201caggravated felony\u201d under the INA includes, in relevant part, \u201can offense ... that involves fraud or deceit in which the loss to the victim or victims exceeds $10,000.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(M)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">In <em>Jaggemauth v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>432 F.3d 1346 (11th Cir.2005), we reviewed an alien\u2019s petition for review of a decision of the former Immigration and Naturalization Service (\u201cINS\u201d) finding the alien removable because her conviction for grand theft was an aggravated felony. <em>Id. </em>at 1347-48. We noted that the INS was required to show by \u201cclear, unequivocal, and convincing evidence\u201d that the alien\u2019s conviction constituted a \u201ctheft offense\u201d under the INA. <em>Id. </em>at 1352. We agreed with the alien that the statute under which she was convicted was divisible and encompassed some offenses that would constitute an aggravated felony and other offenses that would not. <em>Id. </em>at 1354-55. We concluded that, because the statutory language and the fact of conviction were insufficient to determine whether the alien had committed an aggravated felony, the BIA was permitted to look at the alien\u2019s record of conviction, \u201cincluding] the charging document, plea, verdict or judgment, and sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1355. We further concluded that, in light of the alien\u2019s record of conviction, the INS had not shown by clear and convincing evidence that the alien\u2019s conviction was an aggravated felony. <em>Id. </em>In addition, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-8\">[W]e disagree with the BIA that [the alien]\u2019s simultaneous conviction for resisting a merchant establishes that her grand theft conviction was an aggravated felony. The BIA was permitted to look only at the record of conviction for the offense alleged to be an aggravated felony \u2014 not to the record of a separate misdemeanor offense. We can find no authority, and the BIA cites none in its order, that permits the combining of two offenses to determine whether one or the other is an aggravated felony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-9\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b349-10\">Later, in <em>Nijhawan v. Holder, </em>557 U.S. 29, 129 S.Ct. 2294, 174 L.Ed.2d 22 (2009), the Supreme Court determined that \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(M)(i)\u2019s reference to a loss exceeding $10,000 referred to the particular circumstances of the alien\u2019s commission of a fraud offense, rather than a statutory element of the fraud or deceit crime. <em>Id. </em>at 2297-98. The petitioner in <em>Nijhawan </em>had been convicted in federal court of conspiracy to commit mail fraud, wire fraud, bank fraud, and money laundering. <em>Id. </em>at 2298. The jury that convicted him had not made any finding as to loss, but an order of restitution of $683 million was entered against him, and he had stipulated to a loss of over $100 million. <em>Id. </em>The Court explicitly rejected a categorical approach and held that a circumstance-specific approach was appropriate in determining the loss amount. <em>Id. </em>at 2300. The Court stated that \u201cthe loss must be tied to the specific counts covered by the conviction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2303. The Court also said that there was \u201cnothing unfair\u201d about the IJ\u2019s reliance upon certain materials, including the order of restitution against the petitioner, in determining that the loss exceeded $10,000. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b350-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>Here, Bedoya has not shown that the agency erred in concluding that he was statutorily ineligible for cancellation of removal. As we\u2019ve said, Bedoya had to show by a preponderance of the evidence that he had not committed an aggravated felony. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(a); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1240.8(d). Under <em>Nijhawan\u2019s </em>circumstance-specific approach, the agency was allowed to consider the record from Bedo-ya\u2019s conviction, including the amount of any restitution order. 129 S.Ct. at 2303. The record from Bedoya\u2019s criminal proceedings indicates that Bedoya was ordered to pay a total of $38,538 in restitution to the victim as to all of his counts of conviction, which included two counts of uttering of a forged instrument. Despite having the burden to show by a preponderance of the evidence that the loss amount was not in excess of $10,000, Bedo-ya has not objected to this amount or identified any evidence that would explain how the sentencing court calculated his restitution amount. Therefore, Bedoya has not shown by a preponderance of the evidence that he had not committed a fraud offense for which the loss exceeded $10,000. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(M)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">Although Bedoya argues that the loss as to his fraud counts was limited to the face amount of the checks, and that any restitution amount in excess was derived from the other counts of conviction, the burden was on Bedoya to explain any discrepancy between the amount related to the two fraud counts and the restitution amount. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1240.8(d). There is nothing in the record to support Bedoya\u2019s conclusion that the amount of restitution in excess of the face amount of the checks necessarily was tied to the other counts of conviction. Because it was Bedoya\u2019s burden to show that the loss to the victim was not in excess of $10,000, and because he has not met that burden here, the agency did not err in concluding that he was ineligible for cancellation of removal. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">Finally, Bedoya\u2019s arguments regarding <em>Jaggemauth </em>are without merit. First, in <em>Jaggemauth </em>the burden was on the government to show by clear and convincing evidence that the alien\u2019s conviction was an aggravated felony, whereas here, the burden was on Bedoya to show that his conviction was not an aggravated felony. <em>See Jaggernauth, </em>432 F.3d at 1352. Second, <em>Jaggemauth </em>applied a modified categorical approach, which the Supreme Court in <em>Nijhawan </em>expressly rejected for purposes of the loss-amount determination. <em>See Nijhawan, </em>129 S.Ct. at 2300; <em>Jaggernauth, </em>432 F.3d at 1354-55. Third, while <em>Jaggemauth </em>did reject the combination of multiple offenses in determining whether a petitioner had committed an aggravated felony, we were addressing the different issue of the government\u2019s attempt to combine a theft offense with a separate misdemeanor offense of resisting a merchant to determine that one or the other was an aggravated felony. 432 F.3d at 1355. Here, the BIA did not combine any of the elements of Bedoya\u2019s offenses together and did not combine the losses from separate offenses, but instead concluded in light of the restitution order that the loss amount of each individual fraud count may have been in excess of $10,000. Therefore, <em>Jaggemauth </em>is inapplicable, and we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b348-6\">. However, we will not consider Bedoya\u2019s argument on appeal that reliance on the restitution order in his case at this stage of the proceedings would violate his due process rights because Bedoya, by not raising the claim in his initial brief and raising it for the first time in his reply brief, has abandoned the issue. <em>See Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1282 n. 12 (11th Cir.2001). Furthermore, several of Bedoya\u2019s claims on appeal inaccurately identify some of the IJ\u2019s findings as being determinations made by the BIA. First, Bedoya's argument that the BIA erred in combining the losses from two separate offenses in reaching the $10,000 threshold (as well as his \u201calternative\u201d rule-of-lenity argument) mischaracterizes the BIA\u2019s order because the BIA did not add the amounts of the two separate checks in making its cancellation-of-removal determination. To the extent that Bedoya\u2019s argument on appeal is a challenge to the IJ\u2019s determination that the check amounts could be combined, we will not review this challenge because review is limited to the BIA\u2019s order, which did not expressly adopt the IJ\u2019s opinion. <em>See Lopez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>504 F.3d 1341, 1344 (11th Cir.2007) (explaining that because the IJ determination that petitioner challenged had not been adopted by the BIA, it did not form part of the order under review). Nor do we consider Bedoya\u2019s claim that a showing of a scheme to defraud was necessary because the BIA expressly declined to consider the issue. <em>See id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
