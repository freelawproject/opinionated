The district court imposed concurrent sentences of 120 months for Count One and 324 months for Count Five, for a total of 324 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-18\">All of the issues raised by Rodriguez on appeal pertain solely to the 324-month, within-guidelines sentence that was imposed for the drug offense. Rodriguez argues that the district court erred in determining the quantity of methamphefc-amine attributable to him, that the district court erred in applying a two-level enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(3), based on the finding in the presentence report (PSR) that the object of the offense was the distribution of a controlled substance in a prison, and that the district court erred in applying a two-level enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(4), for importing methamphetamine, because he also received a downward adjustment for his mitigating role in the offense under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-19\">We review the district court\u2019s interpretation or application of the Guidelines de novo and its factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008). A district court\u2019s calculation of the quantity of drugs involved in an offense is a factual finding that is entitled to considerable deference and will be reversed only if clearly erroneous. <em>See United States v. Betanc</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number><em>ourt, </em>422 F.3d 240, 246 (5th Cir.2005). A factual finding is not clearly erroneous if it is plausible in light of the record as a whole. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">The base offense level for violating \u00a7 841(a)(1) is determined by the quantity of drugs involved. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1. The district court may consider drug quantities not specified in the count of conviction if they are part of the defendant\u2019s relevant conduct. \u00a7 2D1.1, comment. (n.12); <em>United States v. Burke, </em>431 F.3d 883, 888 (5th Cir.2005). In this case, the district court determined that Rodriguez was responsible for 5.21 kilograms of methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">In making that determination, the district court relied on credible evidence: the PSR and wire-tap conversations between Rodriguez and another gang member regarding the purchase and distribution of methamphetamine. <em>See Betancourt, </em>422 F.3d at 246; <em>United States v. Alford, </em>142 F.3d 825, 831-32 (5th Cir.1998). Rodriguez failed to demonstrate that the information relied upon by the district court was materially untrue. <em>See Betancourt, </em>422 F.3d at 246; <em>Alford, </em>142 F.3d at 832. Even if the evidence could be construed in a way that is be more favorable to Rodriguez, we will not reverse the district court\u2019s decision simply because we could have weighed the evidence differently. <em>See United States v. Davis, </em>76 F.3d 82, 84 (5th Cir.1996). The district court\u2019s determination of the drug quantity attributable to Rodriguez is plausible in light of the record as a whole. <em>See Betancourt, </em>422 F.3d at 246.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">As for Rodriguez\u2019s argument that the evidence was insufficient to support an enhancement under \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(3), the district court was permitted to draw reasonable inferences from the facts presented, and Rodriguez failed to show that the inferences were clearly erroneous. <em>See United States v. Caldwell, </em>448 F.3d 287, 290 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-8\">We agree, however, that the district court erred in imposing an enhancement pursuant to \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(4), given that Rodriguez also received a downward adjustment under \u00a7 3B1.2. Rodriguez acknowledges that because he did not object to the application of the enhancement under \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(4) on this ground in the district court, review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 361 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-9\">Section 2Dl.l(b)(4) provides, in relevant part, that a defendant\u2019s base offense level is increased by two levels, \u201cIf (A) the offense involved the importation of ... methamphetamine ..., and (B) the defendant is not subject to an adjustment under \u00a7 3B1.2 (Mitigating Role).\u201d Because Rodriguez received an adjustment under \u00a7 3B1.2, the application of the enhancement under \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(4) was \u2014 as both parties assert \u2014 clear error.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-10\">Without the error, Rodriguez\u2019s guidelines sentencing range is 262 to 327 months of imprisonment. Although his 324-month sentence falls within that range, it is 62 months higher than the minimum sentence available under the correct guidelines sentencing range. Given that the district court accepted the Government\u2019s recommendation that Rodriguez be sentenced at the bottom of the guidelines range, there is \u201ca reasonable probability that, but for the district court\u2019s error, [Rodriguez] would have received a lower sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Davis, </em>602 F.3d 643, 647 (5th Cir.2010). The district court\u2019s application of the \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(4) enhancement is clear error that affects Rodriguez\u2019s substantial rights and seriously affects the fairness and integrity of judicial proceedings. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 142, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-17\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>Accordingly, we VACATE the 324-month sentence imposed for Count Five and REMAND for resentencing in accordance with this opinion. In all other respects, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b625-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
