We have reviewed counsel\u2019s brief and the relevant portions of the record reflected therein, as well as Guzman-Cruz\u2019s response. We concur with counsel\u2019s assessment that the appeal presents no nonfrivolous issue for appellate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>review. Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">Guzman\u2019s motion for reconsideration of the Clerk\u2019s order denying an extension to file an <em>Anders </em>response to counsel\u2019s initial brief is DENIED. His motion for appointment of new counsel is also DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b677-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
