Amendment 750 took effect on November 1, 2011, and repromulgated as permanent the temporary emergency Amendment 748, which, among other things, lowered the base offense levels for particular crack cocaine quantities listed in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c), pursuant to the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 (\u201cFSA\u201d), Pub.L. No. 111-220, 124 Stat. 2372. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amends. 748, 750. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-18\">In 1995, Robinson was convicted by a jury on one count of conspiring to possess with intent to distribute crack cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and 846, and two counts of possessing with intent to distribute crack cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). The probation officer calculated Robinson\u2019s guideline range using the 1994 version of the Sentencing Guidelines. The officer initially assigned him a base offense level of 32, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D 1.1(a)(3) and (c)(6), because his offense involved at least 50 grams but less that 150 grams of crack cocaine. However, because Robinson had at least two prior felony convictions for a crime of violence, he qualified as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, resulting in a total offense level of 37. This offense level, combined with a criminal history category of VI, yielded a guideline range of 360 months to life imprisonment. The district court ultimately sentenced Robinson to 360 months in prison on all counts, to be served concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-19\">Robinson subsequently filed the instant \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion to reduce his sentence, predicated on Amendment 750. The district court denied the motion, reasoning that Robinson\u2019s sentence calculation was based on the career-offender guideline in \u00a7 4B1.1, not the amended crack cocaine guidelines in \u00a7 2D1.1. Because his guideline range was not lowered by Amendment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>750, a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) was not authorized.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">On appeal, Robinson concedes that he was sentenced as a career offender, but argues that he is nevertheless entitled to receive a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). He contends, essentially, that Amendment 750 was derived from the FSA and, therefore, allows all defendants who were convicted of crack cocaine offenses to receive sentence reductions, even if they were sentenced as career offenders under \u00a7 4B1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">We review a district court\u2019s decision not to reduce a sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1219 (11th Cir.2005). The district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under the Guidelines are reviewed <em>de novo. United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1326 (11th Cir.2008). Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), where a defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment was based on a guideline range \u201cthat has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission,\u201d a district court has the discretion to reduce the sentence \u201cif such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements\u201d of the Guidelines. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The applicable policy statement, found in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, lists those guideline amendments that may apply retroactively to reduce a sentence, and Amendment 750 (parts A and C only) is included in that list. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(c). However, a sentence reduction is not authorized if the listed amendment \u201cdoes not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-11\">In <em>Moore, </em>we faced the question of whether defendants who were sentenced as career offenders under \u00a7 4B1.1 were eligible for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief in light of Amendment 706, which, like Amendment 750, lowered the base offense levels for certain quantities of crack cocaine under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c). <em>Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1325-27. We held that the defendants did not qualify for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief because Amendment 706 had no effect on their guideline ranges, which were calculated under \u00a7 4B1.1. <em>Id. </em>at 1327-30.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-12\">In this case, Robinson was sentenced as a career offender under \u00a7 4B1.1, and, therefore, Amendment 750 had no effect on his guideline range. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 750; <em>Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1327-30. Although <em>Moore </em>was decided prior to the FSA\u2019s enactment, nothing in the FSA alters the fact that \u00a7 3582(c)(2) only allows sentence reductions if the defendant\u2019s guideline range \u201chas subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission,\u201d and the Commission did not lower Robinson\u2019s career-offender guideline range through Amendment 750. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); FSA, Pub.L. No. 111-220, 124 Stat. 2372. In this light, the district court had no authority to modify Robinson\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and did not err in denying his' motion. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b362-8\">. In his brief to this Court, Robinson cites extensively to <em>Freeman v. United States, </em>564 U.S. \u2014, 131 S.Ct. 2685, 180 L.Ed.2d 519 (2011) (plurality opinion). However, his reliance on <em>Freeman </em>is misplaced. In that case, a plurality of Supreme Court Justices held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>that a district court may grant a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction where the defendant had received a specific sentence pursuant to a plea agreement and the sentence was based on subsequently amended Guidelines. <em>See Freeman, </em>564 U.S. at \u2014, 131 S.Ct. at 2691-95. Here, Robinson never entered into a plea agreement, and, as previously explained, his guideline range was not based on subsequently amended Guidelines.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
