The district court found that Rodriguez violated the conditions of his supervised release by (1) committing identity theft in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028; (2) failing to notify the probation office of a change in employment which involved obtaining a second job at 1-800-WeAnswer; and (3) associating with Riyadh Nagi, a convicted felon.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A district court may revoke a term of supervised release if the court \u201cfinds by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant violated a condition of supervised release.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">We review for abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s judgment revoking a defendant\u2019s supervised release. <em>United States v. Velasquez Velasquez, </em>524 F.3d 1248, 1252 (11th Cir.2008). We review a district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error. <em>United States v. Almand, </em>992 F.2d 316, 318 (11th Cir.1993). Rodriguez first argues that this reporting requirement was ambiguous and did not clearly apply to \u201cadditional employment.\u201d We disagree. Rodriguez was on notice that, as a condition of supervised release, he had to report \u201cany change in residence or employment.\u201d A plain reading of this supervised release condition suggests that \u201cany change\u201d is broad enough to apply to the circumstances in this case, where a defendant obtains employment additional to any previously reported employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-9\">Rodriguez also argues that the district court erred in considering hearsay evidence as a basis for finding that he engaged in identity theft. At the revocation hearing, it was alleged that Rodriguez used his new place of employment, 1-800-WeAnswer, to obtain the personal information of an elderly gentleman, Bernard Greenberg. It was further alleged that Rodriguez and Nagi opened a QVC Shopping Network (\u201cQVC\u201d) account using Greenberg\u2019s name and social security number, and made purchases under this account.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-10\">The government introduced documentation indicating that Greenberg\u2019s medical information, which included Greenberg\u2019s name, address, phone number, date of birth, and social security number, was accessed by Rodriguez on March 31, 2010. Nagi provided a written statement to law enforcement, in which he wrote that Rodriguez had informed Nagi he was in the medical billing field and had access to personal information, that Rodriguez provided that information, and that Nagi and Rodriguez filled out an application for a QVC card.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defense objected to the introduction of this statement on hearsay grounds, and because it was not \u201csworn,\u201d but the magistrate judge overruled the objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-11\">Finally, Michael Kennedy, a detective with the Broward County Sheriffs Office, testified at the hearing that he had conducted surveillance on Nagi at a Dunkin\u2019 Donuts on June 28, 2010, and that Rodriguez was present with Nagi at the Dunkin\u2019 Donuts. During a search of Nagi\u2019s gar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>bage on June 24, 2010, Kennedy found several QVC packing slips Greenberg\u2019s name. Kennedy contacted Greenberg who told Kennedy that he had not ordered any items from QVC. Greenberg later received a bill from QVC, which was sent to his residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">The magistrate judge found by a preponderance of the evidence that Rodriguez had committed identity theft, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028(a)(7), based on the following circumstantial evidence: (1) Rodriguez accessed Greenberg\u2019s information; (2) a QVC account was opened in Green-berg\u2019s name; (3) someone made unauthorized purchases on the QVC card; (4) QVC packaging materials in Greenberg\u2019s name were found in Nagi\u2019s trash during a \u201ctrash pull\u201d; and (5) Rodriguez and Nagi were seen four days after the trash pull at a Dunkin\u2019 Donuts on Nagi\u2019s laptop computer.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">Although the Federal Rules of Evidence do not apply in the context of a supervised release revocation hearing, hearsay statements must be reliable. In deciding whether to admit hearsay testimony of an absent witness, the district court must (1) make findings that the hearsay was reliable; and (2) \u201cbalance the defendant\u2019s right to confront adverse witnesses against the grounds asserted by the government for denying confrontation.\u201d <em>United States v. Frazier, </em>26 F.3d 110, 114 (11th Cir.1994). Rodriguez argues that the magistrate erred by relying on Nagi\u2019s hearsay statements in finding that Rodriguez committed identity theft because these statements were hearsay and Rodriguez was not given an opportunity to confront Nagi and cross-examine him. Indeed, it was error for the magistrate to fail to make findings as to the reliability of the admitted hearsay or to conduct the <em>Frazier </em>balancing test. However, such error was harmless because other, properly considered circumstantial evidence was sufficient to support the court\u2019s conclusion that Rodriguez committed the crime of identity theft while on supervised release by a preponderance of the evidence. Further, we hold that the court properly found that Rodriguez was required, and failed, to report his additional employment, and that he was associating with a convicted felon in -violation of his supervised release. Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion by revoking Rodriguez\u2019s supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b352-6\">.
