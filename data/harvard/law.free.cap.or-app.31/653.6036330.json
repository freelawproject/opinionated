The sole issue on appeal is whether the trial court committed prejudicial error in permitting the prosecution to present evidence that, at the time of his arrest, defendant possessed a forged driver\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-4\">The rape occurred on the evening of July 14,1976. The victim, while walking home, accepted a ride from two men in a sports car. After purchasing three quarts of beer and procuring some pills, the men drove the victim to an abandoned hotel in Scotts Mills where they forced her to submit to sexual intercourse and sodomy. Thereafter they threatened harm to her and members of her family if she did not meet them at 3 p.m. the next afternoon. She agreed to do so, and the men then drove her to her home in Portland.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">The next day, the victim reported the incident to the police. At 3 p.m. she went with police officers to the appointed meeting place. A short time later defendant and a companion arrived at the scene in a white Ford automobile. Upon seeing the victim in the company of the police, they fled. After a ten-block automobile chase, and a short pursuit on foot, defendant and his companion were apprehended. The men were positively identified by the victim, both at the time of their arrest and at trial. Although defendant presented evidence that he was elsewhere on the night of the rape, his palm print was found on a quart beer bottle recovered near the scene of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">Defendant\u2019s assignment of error is addressed to the admission in evidence over proper objection of the testimony by a deputy sheriff that defendant was found at the time of his apprehension to possess forged identification.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b690-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"[656]\">*[656]</page-number>Evidence that defendant possessed forged identification at the time of his arrest was admissible only if relevant for some purpose other than to show defendant\u2019s bad character.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>State v. Manrique, </em>271 Or 201, 531 P2d 239 (1975); <em>State v. Zimmerlee, </em>261 Or 49, 492 P2d 795 (1972); <em>State v. Kelley, </em>29 Or App 321, 563 P2d 749 <em>rev den </em>(1977); <em>State v. Hockings, </em>29 Or App 139, 562 P2d 587 <em>rev den </em>(1977); <em>State v. Holmes, </em>22 Or App 23, 537 P2d 566 <em>rev den </em>(1975). The state contends that defendant\u2019s possession of false identification is evidence of his effort to avoid apprehension and is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"[657]\">*[657]</page-number>therefore relevant to indicate his consciousness of guilt. <em>Cf, State v. Jones, </em>11 Or App 129, 138-9, 500 P2d 1225 <em>rev den </em>(1972). In Oregon, evidence of flight to avoid arrest is admissible on this theory, <em>State v. Brown, </em>231 Or 297, 299-300, 372 P2d 779 (1962); <em>State v. Redeman, </em>9 Or App 329, 335 (n 4), 496 P2d 230 <em>rev den </em>(1972), and the state relies upon cases from other states which have held that assumption of a false name is a form of flight which is therefore admissible. <em>Rogers v. State, </em>262 Ind 315, 315 NE2d 707, 712 (1974); <em>People v. Waller, </em>14 Cal 2d 693, 96 P2d 344 (1939). There is no fixed rule, however, and each case turns on its facts. McCormick, Evidence 655-6, \u00a7 271 (2d ed E. Cleary 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-3\">This case does not support such an analysis. Defendant did not know that he was suspected of rape until he observed the police awaiting his arrival at the agreed upon meeting place. It is unreasonable to infer that he acquired false identification in anticipation of his arrest on the rape charge. Nor did defendant use the Washington driver\u2019s license in an effort to avoid arrest. The officer found the license in the course of a search incident to arrest. Defendant\u2019s representation that the license had been issued to him was in response to questioning. It is difficult to perceive how this evidence sheds any light on defendant\u2019s attitude toward the rape charge. We therefore conclude that the testimony relating to defendant\u2019s possession of false identification had no tendency to prove defendant\u2019s consciousness of guilt or any other relevant fact and its admission was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-4\">Having found error, we must now consider whether defendant was prejudiced thereby. Error may be deemed harmless if there is substantial and convincing evidence of guilt and if we can conclude with reasonable certainty that, absent the error, a different verdict would not have resulted. <em>State v. Van Hooser, </em>266 Or 19, 511 P2d 359 (1973); <em>State v. Hockings, </em>23 Or App 274, 283, 542 P2d 133 <em>rev den </em>(1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"[658]\">*[658]</page-number>Typically, the improper admission of evidence of other bad acts is deemed prejudicial because of the extreme likelihood that such evidence will blacken the defendant\u2019s character in the minds of the jury. <em>See, State v. Bateham, </em>94 Or 524, 530, 186 P 5 (1919); <em>State v. Kelley, </em>29 Or App at 326; <em>State v. Pitts, </em>29 Or App 59, 65, 562 P2d 562, 30 Or App 1, 566 P2d 182 <em>rev den </em>(1977). However, this is not a universal rule. The degree of prejudice that such evidence carries with it varies according to the disapprobation associated with the particular acts and according to the similarity between the character traits revealed by those acts and character traits which are typically associated with the charged offense. <em>State v. Hockings, </em>29 Or App 139, 562 P2d 587 <em>rev den </em>(1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-3\">In this case, defendant\u2019s possession of false identification, although not innocuous, is not the sort of conduct likely to invoke the jury\u2019s outrage. It reveals nothing about his character which makes it more likely that defendant would commit rape or sodomy. Because defendant did not testify, the evidence did not reflect on his credibility as a witness. Such evidence could tip the scales in a close case, but add little to strong evidence of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\">Here, the evidence of defendant\u2019s guilt was compelling. The positive identification by the complaining witness, the presence of defendant\u2019s palm print on a bottle found near the scene of the crime, and defendant\u2019s flight when he returned and saw the police, all allow us to conclude with reasonable certainty that the verdict was not affected by the admission of the improper evidence. We therefore hold that the error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b689-7\"> \"Q [by the prosecutor] I ask that you be handed, through the courtesy of the bailiff, what has been marked State\u2019s Exhibit # 10 for identification.

Kelley, </em>29 Or App 321, 325 (n 4), 563 P2d 749 rev den (1977); <em>State v. Pitts, </em>29 Or App 59, 562 P2d 562, 30 Or App 1, 566 P2d 182 <em>rev den </em>(1977). The rule really operates to exclude evidence of prior bad acts, whether criminal or not, which are relevant to the crime charged only insofar as they tend to prove that defendant is a bad person who is therefore more likely to have committed the charged offense. <em>See </em>McCormick, Evidence 447, \u00a7 190 (2d ed E. Cleary 1972).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
