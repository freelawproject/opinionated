Defendant also urges error based upon ORS 161.485(3)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>. The state contends that defendant waived his double jeopardy rights by opposing its motion to consolidate the charges of attempted rape (ORS 163.375)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and sexual abuse in the first degree. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-4\">On August 2, 1976, defendant was indicted for attempted rape in the first degree to which he pled not guilty. The charge arose from defendant having leaned through a car window and having touched the prosecutrix\u2019s breasts and genital area through her clothing. On November 3, 1976, defendant was indicted for sexual abuse in the first degree based on the identical acts involved in the indictment for attempted rape. On November 9,1976, the state filed a motion to consolidate the two charges.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On November 15 defendant opposed the state\u2019s motion to consolidate and it was denied. On November 16 trial without a jury was held on the attempted rape charge and the court found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"[1246]\">*[1246]</page-number>defendant guilty of the lesser included<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> crime of \"attempted sexual abuse.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> No judgment order was entered. Instead there was an order entered deferring sentencing until completion of trial on the second indictment. On December 6,1976, defendant moved to dismiss the second indictment for sexual abuse in the first degree on the grounds of (1) double jeopardy and (2) ORS 161.485(3). The motion was denied. A subsequent trial was held based upon the identical evidence adduced at the first trial which was received by stipulation and the defendant was found guilty of \"sexual abuse in the first degree.\u201d The two guilty findings were merged for the purpose of imposition of sentence. Defendant contends that the court erred in denying his motion to dismiss on grounds of (1) double jeopardy, and (2) because defendant was allegedly convicted of \"both the actual commission of an offense and an attempt to commit that offense,\u201d as proscribed by ORS 161.485(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-3\">The Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> as well as Art I, \u00a7 12 of the Oregon Constitution<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and ORS 131.515<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> all provide double <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"[1247]\">*[1247]</page-number>jeopardy protection only when a defendant is being prosecuted a second time for the <em>same offense.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1287-3\">In <em>State v. Brown, </em>262 Or 442, 497 P2d 1191, 1196 (1972), the Oregon Supreme Court held that under the double jeopardy provision contained in Art I, \u00a7 12 of the Oregon Constitution, statutory violations may constitute the \"same offense\u201d for purposes of testing a second prosecution, even though each contains different elements and requires proof of different facts. In <em>State v. Hammang, </em>271 Or 749, 534 P2d 501 (1975), the court explained this rule indicating that when two charges are based upon exactly the same conduct, a trial on the second charge after conviction of the first would constitute a trial for the same offense and violate defendant\u2019s double jeopardy rights. Defendant in the case at bar was prosecuted for the same offense; however, he had waived his double jeopardy rights by resisting consolidation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1287-4\">Generally when the defense opposes the state\u2019s motion to consolidate, the defendant waives double jeopardy protection. <em>State v. Boyd, </em>271 Or 558, 568-70, 533 P2d 795 (1975); <em>State v. Bishop, </em>16 Or App 310, 314, 518 P2d 177 (1974). Defendant argues that the Boyd/Bishop rule should not apply to multiple prosecutions based upon the same conduct. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1287-5\">The defendant by opposing the state\u2019s motion to consolidate, has attempted to preclude the state from trying him on a charge for which he could have been originally prosecuted. We see no reason to penalize the state in this manner when the state has made a bona fide effort to consolidate the charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b1287-6\">We have previously resolved defendant\u2019s contention that the court erred in denying his motion to dismiss <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"[1248]\">*[1248]</page-number>the indictment for \"sexual abuse in the first degree\u201d because the court had found him guilty of \"attempted sexual abuse\u201d in the first trial. There was no error because the two findings of guilty were merged into one conviction for sentencing. <em>See State v.
