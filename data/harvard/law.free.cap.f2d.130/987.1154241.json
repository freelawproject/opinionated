The bondholders\u2019 committee selected appellant corporation as an agent for secretarial services, and appellant thereafter advanced the sum of $10,-760.63 for expenses incurred by the bondholders\u2019 committee, as well as for its own secretarial services. The foregoing amount appears to have been advanced on March 20, 1933, for services incurred in 1931 and 1932.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-22\">On July 5, 1939, petitions, proposing an arrangement with creditors, were filed under Chapter XII of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 801 et seq. On July 22, 1940, the district court confirmed an arrangement proposed by the mortgage bondholders\u2019 committee, and later, on May 15, 1941, the court affirmed a modified arrangement. On June 27, 1941, the district court disallowed appellant\u2019s claim for services and reimbursement of expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-23\">Under the statute, the district judge was vested with discretion to allow compensation for services and expenses in connection with the administration of an estate in a proceeding under Chapter XII or in connection with an arrangement confirmed by the court. Whether the services or expenses contributed to the administration of the estate or the arrangement with creditors, was the question to be decided by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-24\">Various reorganization efforts were carried on by the bondholders\u2019 committee during several years before the final petition in bankruptcy, and appellant corporation performed secretarial services in connection therewith; but whether such services were of any worth in the subsequent administration and the final creditors\u2019 arrangement, were matters to be determined by the district judge. He, obviously, concluded that they were of no value and that they contributed nothing to the administration of the estate or the eventual settlement; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"988\">*988</page-number>his denial of appellant\u2019s claim rested within his discretion, with which we find no reasons to interfere.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-4\">The order of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
