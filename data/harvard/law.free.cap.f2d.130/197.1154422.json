The plaintiff was a member of the Unemployment Insurance Appeal Board of the State of New York (\u00a7 518, subdivision 6, of the Labor Law, Consol.Laws, c. 31). On September 15, 1941, the United States Civil Service Commission began a proceeding against him, charging him with \u201csponsoring, aiding and abetting the election of party committeemen\u201d in the County of New York and with taking \u201can active part in political campaigns.\u201d If the Commission convicts the accused of such activity and advises the st\u00e1te agency of the conviction; and if the agency does not remove the culprit, the Commission must certify \u201cto the appropriate Federal agency an order requiring it to withhold from its loans or grants to the State or local agency * * * an amount equal to two years\u2019 compensation\u201d of the plaintiff. \u00a7 <em>611 </em>(b), Title 18 U.S.C.A. While this charge was pending the plaintiff resigned his position as member of the Appeal Board, and thereafter he began this action. He has not alleged that the \u201cmatter in controversy exceeds * * * $3,-000\u201d and he obviously could not do so; for at most it could be nothing but the value of his opportunity at some later time to be again appointed to his former position. Even though we assume that the salary was more than $3,000, nobody can possibly appraise the present value of that opportunity, and indeed it can hardly have any'value whatever.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-9\">The District Court could have jurisdiction of the action only under \u00a7 41(1) (First) (a), or \u00a7 41(1) (First) (b) of Title 28 U.S.C.A.; because it \u201carises under the Constitution or laws of the United States,\u201d or because it \u201cis between citizens of different States, or citizens of the District of Columbia.\u201d In either case the \u201camount in controversy\u201d must \u201cexceed\u201d $3,000; and the court had no jurisdiction. The judge should have dismissed the action on that ground and not upon the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-11\">Judgment modified so as to dismiss the complaint for lack of jurisdiction and not on the merits; and, as' modified, affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
