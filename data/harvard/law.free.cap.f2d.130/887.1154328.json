Before the passage of the Chandler Act leave was indeed necessary, but only because \u00a7 24, sub. b, as amended in 1926, 44 Stat. 664, 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 47, sub. b, made discretionary all appeals taken from orders in \u201cproceedings of the several inferior -courts of bankruptcy.\u201d Shulman v. Wilson-Sheridan Hotel Company, 301 U.S. 172, 57 S.Ct. 680, 81 L.Ed. 986. The Chandler Act amended \u00a7 24(a), 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 47, :sub. a\u2014which had theretofore applied only to \u201ccontroversies arising in bankruptcy proceedings\u201d\u2014by granting an appeal as of right, in both \u201cproceedings\u201d and \u201ccontroversies,\u201d though it gave a discretionary power to the circuit courts of appeal in all cases when the \u201corder * * * involves less than $500.\u201d (Section 24, sub. b, was amended so as merely to provide that the procedure should be the same in all cases as in ordinary appeals.)</p>\n<p id=\"b947-17\">There can be no doubt, so far as we can' see, that except for \u00a7 250 of the Chandler Act, 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 650, the result would have been to give to attorneys an appeal as of right from any order fixing their allowances in all kinds of reorganizations. There had never been any \u201cpolicy\u201d to limit appeals from allowances as such; they merely took their place as appeals in \u201cproceedings.\u201d In the House discretionary appeals from orders in \u201cproceedings\u201d had been retained, and \u00a7 250, which was in its present form, was entirely harmonious. The Supreme Court held in Dickinson Industrial Site, Inc., v. Cowan, 309 U.S. 382, 60 S.Ct. 595, 84 L.Ed. 819, that the Senate\u2019s retention of the phrase \u201cand allowed by,\u201d in \u00a7 250 after it had so radically amended \u00a7 24 was not an inadvertence, but evidence of an intent to make an exception in the case of orders for allowances in ordinary corporate reorganizations; although it did indeed go on to say that there was no evidence of any purpose to change the old law as to such appeals, and that it was \u201csound policy to require fiduciaries to make out a prima facie case of inequitable treatment in order to be heard before the appellate court.\u201d 309 U.S. page 389, 60 S.Ct. page 599, 84 L.Ed. 819.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-18\">It must be owned that at first blush that \u201cpolicy\u201d seems as apposite to railroad reorganizations as to any others, and so far as policy should override language there is a certain force in the appellees\u2019 position here. But even in this aspect there is a difference, for in no case can an attorney in a railroad reorganization receive more than the maximum fixed by the Interstate Commerce Commission under \u00a7 77, sub. c (12); so that in practice the only issue which such appeals can raise is whether the district judge was wrong in not awarding the whole or some part of the difference between the \u201cceiling\u201d fixed by the Commission and the amount which he did award. That gives a much greater protection against abuse than is in Chapter X, 11 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 501 et seq., and may have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>regarded as a just excuse for allowing an appeal as of right. Be that as it may, we should hardly have thought it permissible to read out of \u00a7 250 and into \u00a7 77, sub. c(12), those words upon which the Supreme Court mainly rested its decision in Dickinson Industrial Site, Inc., v. Cowan, supra, even though railroad reorganizations were in this regard more closely parallel to other reorganizations than they are. Strictly, we are not indeed faced with a conflict between a patent purpose and its ineffective expression; the situation is of two conflicting purposes, one to abolish the troublesome former distinction between appeals in \u201cproceedings\u201d and \u201ccontroversies,\u201d and the other to limit appeals in orders fixing allowances. We cannot be sure which of these Congress would inevitably have preferred in the case of railroads, and we must be guided by the words used.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-4\">The motion for leave to appeal is denied, because an appeal lies as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-5\">The motion to dismiss the appeal is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
