Silberkleit, its president, prepare, verify and file in the office of the Referee herein, in duplicate, a detailed inventory showing the cost to it of its merchandise consisting of ladies\u2019 dresses, and the cost to it of the materials and labor entered into the garments made out of such materials, by such labor, item by item, and the quantity of garments on hand, all as of the 13th day of September, 1940, the date of bankruptcy.\u201d It is true that this is in result no different from the order as entered, for no goods could have been purchased after the date of the assignment, July 17, 1940, and the cost of those then on hand was of course already determined. Nevertheless, the order should conform with the letter of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-10\">Order modified as aforesaid and, as modified, affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-11\">On Motion to Clarify Opinion.</p>\n<author id=\"b255-23\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"AFD\">The change made in the order merely to conform literally with the statute. Its meaning is that Silberkleit shall state in the inventory the dresses and materials on hand when the assignees took possession, together with anything else which came to the bankrupt\u2019s possession thereafter, or to the assignees\u2019. It makes no difference whether or not the assignees sold any part of the property before the 13th day of September; the inventory wiil still be \u201cas of\u201d that day. The cost will be the original cost, together with any additional sums which m\u00a3W have been expended upon the property.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
