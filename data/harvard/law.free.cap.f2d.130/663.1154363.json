The lands in question were purchased for and on behalf of Wosey John, now Deere, by the Secretary of the Interior from non-Indian owners<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>, out of accumulated trust or restricted funds derived as proceeds from oil and gas produced from the restricted allotment of the said Wosey John, now Deere, pursuant to Section one of the Act of May 27, ,1908, 35 Stat. 312.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\">One parcel of land purchased on December 11, 1915, consisted of property located within the city limits of Sapulpa, Oklahoma ; one tract purchased March 24, 1920, consisted of 7% acres of agricultural land; and another tract purchased December 8, 1927, consisted of 80 acres of agricultural land, all located in Creek County, Oklahoma. Each of the deeds to Wosey John, now Deere, contained a provision restricting the land against alienation or encumbrance unless approved by the Secretary of the Interior, or unless otherwise provided by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">On March 4, 1931, the said Wosey Tohn\u201e now Deere, in consideration of \u201c$1.00 and love and affection\u201d, and with the consent and approval of the Secretary of the Interior, conveyed all of the lands in question to her children and heirs (appellees here), reserving unto herself a life estate in the lands, together with the rents and profits therefrom. The deed of conveyance contained a provision against alienation or encumbrance unless approved by the Secretary of the Interior, with a further provision in the habendum clause as follows: \u201cTo have and to hold said described premises, unto said grantees, their heirs and assigns, forever, free, clear and discharged of all * * * taxes, judgments, * * * and other liens and encumbrances of whatsoever nature * * * \u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">Thereafter and on December 10, 1937, in consideration of \u201c$1.00 and love and affection\u201d, the said Wosey John, now Deere, conveyed her life estate, heretofore reserved in all of the land, to the appellees. The conveyance was not approved by the Secretary of the Interior, but the Superintendent of the Five Civilized Tribes certified that the land in question was purchased for the appellees to be held in trust by the United States of America for their benefit by virtue of their being full-blood Creek Indians, not enrolled, and that the deed was executed and approved pursuant to the Act of May 27, 1908, supra. On December 16, 1937, the appellees executed a certificate designating the agricultural lands, consisting of 87% acres, as their homestead. The said certificate was approved by the Secretary of the Interior on March 24, 1938, and duly filed in the office of the county clerk of Creek County, Oklahoma.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-8\">Prior to 1936, all the lands in question, whether held in the name of Wosey John, now Deere, or her children (appellees here), were subject to taxation by the State of Oklahoma and its political subdivisions, McCurdy v. United States, 246 U.S. 263, 38 S.Ct. 289, 62 L.Ed. 706; United States v. Gray, 8 Cir., 284 F. 103; United States v. Ransom, 8 Cir., 284 F. 108, Id., 263 U.S. 691, 44 S.Ct. 230, 68 L.Ed. 508; see, also, Shaw v. Gibson-Zahniser Oil Corporation, 276 U.S. 575, 48 S.Ct. 333, 72 L.Ed. 709, and apparently taxes were levied, assessed and collected on the said lands as unrestricted and nonexempt lands in Oklahoma.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-9\">The appellees paid the ad valorem taxes and penalties levied and assessed against all the lands in question for the taxable years 1936 and 1937, and the taxes and penalties levied and assessed against the agricultural land (which had been designated as a homestead on December 16, 1937), for the taxable year 1938, and a part of the taxable years 1939 and 1940. The Creek County officials levied and assessed taxes against all of the property, including the homestead, for the taxable years 1940 and 1941, and assert the power to continue to levy and assess taxes against all of the lands in question, and to collect the taxes by sale as provided by the laws of Oklahoma.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-10\">Effective Tune 20, 1936, Congress passed an Act (Public No. 716, 49 Stat. 1542), \u201cTo relieve restricted Indians whose lands have been taxed or have been lost by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>failure to pay taxes, and for other purposes\u201d. By Section one of the Act, Congress appropriated $25,000.00 to be expended under rules and regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Interior for the payment of taxes, penalties, and interest, assessed against individually owned Indian lands, the title to which is held subject to restrictions against alienation or encumbrance, except with the consent or approval of the Secretary of the Interior, and heretofore purchased out of trust or restricted funds of an Indian, where the Secretary finds that such land was purchased with the understanding and belief on the part of said Indian that after purchase it would be nontaxable, and for redemption or reacquisition of any such lands heretofore or hereafter sold for nonpayment of taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">Section two of the Act provides, \u201cAll lands the title to which is now held by an. Indian subject to restrictions against alienation or encumbrance except with the consent or approval of the Secretary of the Interior, heretofore purchased out of trust or restricted funds of said Indian, are hereby declared to be instrumentalities of the Federal Government and shall be nontaxable until otherwise directed by Congress\u201d. (See Senate Report No. 2168, 74th Congress, Second Session. House Report No. 2398, 74th Congress, Second Session).</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">After passage of the Act of June 20, 1936, supra, it was found that the provisions of Section two thereof would apply to lands and other property purchased by restricted Indian funds which would exempt from taxation vast quantities of property, such as business buildings and farm lands which were not homesteads, and would consequently place an unfair burden upon taxable lands included within the taxing jurisdiction. Accordingly, the Commissioner of Indian Affairs appeared before the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs and suggested an amendment to the Act of June 20, 1936, supra. (See Senate Report No. 332, 75th Congress, First Session). Accordingly, the Act of May 19, 1937, Public No. 96, 50 Stat. 188, 25 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 412a, amended Section two of the Act of June 20, 1936, supra, to read as follows: <em>\u201cAll homesteads, </em>heretofore purchased out of the trust or restricted funds of individual Indians, are hereby declared to be instrumentalities of the Federal Government and shall be nontaxable until otherwise directed by Congress: Provided, That the title to such homesteads shall be held subject to restrictions against alienation or encumbrance except with the approval of the Secretary of the Interior: And provided further, That the Indian owner or owners shall select, with the approval of the Secretary of the Interior, either the agricultural and grazing lands, not exceeding a total of one hundred and sixty acres, or the village, town, or city property, not exceeding in cost $5,000, to be designated as a homestead\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-8\">Tax immunity as to all the lands involved is asserted for the years 1936 and 1937 under the provisions of Section two of the Act of June 20, 1936, supra, while immunity is claimed on the designated homestead only for the years 1938, 1939, 1940 and thereafter, under the provisions of the amendatory Act of May 19, 1937, supra. The principal question for decision is whether all the lands are exempt from ad valorem taxation under the Act of June 20, 1936, supra, for the period during which the said Act is applicable; and whether the designated homestead is exempt from taxation under the amendatory Act of May 19, 1937, supra, for the period during which it is applicable. Subsidiary to the principal question is the determination of the taxable period during which the original and the amendatory acts are applicable to the lands involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-9\">The trial court sustained the contentions of the appellees, gave judgment for the amount of the taxes and penalties paid, plus 6% interest from the date of payment; cancelled the assessed but unpaid taxes and penalties as illegal and void, and perpetually enjoined the taxing authorities (appellants here) from further levy or assessment of ad valorem taxes on the designated homestead. D.C., 38 F.Supp. 731.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-10\">On appeal, as below, the jurisdiction over the subject matter is challenged for lack of diversity of citizenship, but clearly, the controversy involves the validity, construction, or effect of a law of the United States, upon the determination of which the result depends. The right or immunity asserted here is such that it will be supported if the law is given one construction and effect, and defeated if it receives another. Shulthis v. McDougal, 225 U.S. 561, 32 S.Ct. 704, 56 L.Ed. 1205; Gully v. First National Bank, 299 U.S. 109, 57 S.Ct. 96, 81 L.Ed. 70. The requisite amount in controversy is present and the court had jurisdiction of the sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>ject matter regardless of diversity of citizenship.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">The constitutionality of the acts involved here is also challenged on the grounds that Congress is without power, under the Federal instrumentality doctrine, to create a tax-free instrumentality from otherwise taxable lands by purchase of the same with trust or restricted funds of a restricted Indian, and by prohibiting their alienation without the consent and approval of the Secretary of the Interior.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">Undoubtedly the Secretary of the Interior was authorized to purchase the lands in question from the trust or restricted funds of Wosey John, now Deere, and to restrict their alienation or encumbrance without the Secretary\u2019s consent and approval. Section one of the Act of May 27, 1908, supra; Sunderland v. United States, 266 U.S. 226, 45 S.Ct. 64, 69 L.Ed. 259; United States v. Law, 8 Cir., 250 F. 218; United States v. Brown, 8 Cir., 8 F.2d 564; United States v. Goldfeder, 10 Cir., 112 F.2d 615. Likewise the Secretary of the Interior was authorized to approve the conveyance from Wosey John, now Deere, to her full-blood restricted children, subject to the same restrictions, and the said lands retained their restricted character in the grantees. Clinkenbeard v. United States, 10 Cir., 109 F.2d 730, and Act of January 27, 1933, 47 Stat. 777.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\"> Aside from the historically paramount power of Congress to legislate for and on behalf of its Indian wards, United States v. Kagama, 118 U.S. 375, 6 S.Ct. 1109, 30 L.Ed. 228; Cherokee Nation v. Hitchcock, 187 U.S. 294, 23 S.Ct. 115, 47 L.Ed. 183; United States v. Rickert, 188 U.S. 432, 23 S.Ct. 478, 47 L.Ed. 532; Tiger v. Western Investment Company, 221 U.S. 286, 31 S.Ct. 578, 55 L.Ed. 738; Choate v. Trapp, 224 U.S. 665, 32 S.Ct. 565, 56 L.Ed. 941; United States v. Wright, 4 Cir., 53 F.2d 300, the State of Oklahoma, has by acceptance of statehood under Section one of the Enabling Act (Act of June 16, 1906, 34 Stat. 267), conceded the power and authority of the United States government to make any law or regulation respecting Indians, their lands, property, or other rights by treaties, agreement, law or otherwise. Tiger v. Western Investment Company, supra; Ex parte Webb, 225 U.S. 663, 678, 32 S.Ct. 769, 56 L.Ed. 1248; United States v. Sandoval, 231 U.S. 28, 48, 34 S.Ct. 1, 58 L.Ed. 107. The State of Oklahoma has recognized the paramount jurisdiction of the Federal Government to legislate for and on behalf of its Indian wards with respect to lands located within state boundaries. Gleason v. Wood, 28 Okl. 502, 114 P. 703, 705; McIntosh v. Dill, 86 Okl. 1, 205 P. 917; Wynn v. Fugate, 149 Okl. 210, 299 P. 890; Mashunkashey v. Mashunkashey, Okl.Sup., - P.2d -<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> decided September 29, 1942; United States v. Board of Commissioners of Osage County, D.C., 26 F.Supp. 270, 275. By these acts (Acts of June 20, 1936 and May 19, 1937, supra), Congress has assumed a guardianship over the affairs of restricted Indians, with respect to which it has the undubitable power to legislate and by such legislation to protect its guardianship against encroachment or impairment by the state through its taxing powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-10\"> But the restrictions against alienation imposed by the Secretary of the Interior, in virtue of his power and duty to supervise Indians and Indian affairs, do not without more operate to effect an immunity from state taxation. Restrictions against alienation imposed by the Secretary of the Interior do not necessarily create a tax-free government instrumentality. McCurdy v. United States, supra; United States v. Gray, supra; United States v. Ransom, supra; Shaw v. Gibson-Zahniser Oil Corporation, supra; Choteau v. Burnet, 283 U.S. 691, 51 S.Ct. 598, 75 L.Ed. 1353; Superintendent Five Civilized Tribes v. Commissioner, 295 U.S. 418, 55 S.Ct. 820, 79 L.Ed. 1517; Landman v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 10 Cir., 123 F.2d 787. Lands allotted to individual Indians in pursuance of a treaty or act of Congress, by the terms of which it is agreed between the United States Government and the tribe, assented to. by the state, that the lands thus allotted in severalty shall remain tax-free for a stipulated period, creates a vested property right in the individual allottee which neither the national nor state government may impair or invade. It is a vested property right protected by the constitution, and any attempt to invade or impair will be judged in the light of the treaty obligations of the United States, and especially in the light of the obligation which the United States Government has historically assumed in relation to its intercourse with the Indian tribes. Act of June 28, 1898, 30 Stat. 495, 507; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>Act of May 27, 1908, 35 Stat. 312. United States v. Thurston County, 8 Cir., 143 F. 287; United States v. Rickert, supra; Carpenter v. Shaw, 280 U.S. 363, 50 S.Ct. 121, 74 L.Ed. 478; Choate v. Trapp, supra; Ward v. Board of County Com\u2019rs of Love County, 253 U.S. 17, 40 S.Ct. 419, 64 L.Ed. 751; Bryan County v. United States, 10 Cir., 123 F.2d 782.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-4\">But unlike lands allotted in severalty to members of the Five Civilized Tribes, under an agreement or treaty, providing for immunity from taxation until removed by the terms of the agreement or treaty, tax immunity here depends upon the express will of Congress, and must be found within the plain terms of the legislation relied upon to effect the exemption. Shaw v. Gibson-Zahniser Oil Corporation, supra. By the Act of June 20, 1936, as amended by the Act of May 19, 1937, supra, Congress has plainly expressed a purpose to protect lands purchased with trust or restricted funds of a restricted Indian so long as the said lands are restricted from alienation without the approval of the Secretary of the Interior, and to effect that purpose, Congress has declared such lands to be instrumentalities of the Federal Government and exempt from taxation until otherwise directed by Congress. The history of the legislation, as well as the text of the acts, indicates quite clearly a Congressional purpose to fulfill its obligation to this particular class of Indians arising out of an erroneous assumption that the restricted character of the lands in question operated to create a tax-free instrumentality by necessary implication. See McCurdy v. United States, supra; Shaw v. Gibson Zahniser Oil Corporation, supra; United States v. Ransom, supra; United States v. Gray, supra; Landman v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, supra; Superintendent Five Civilized Tribes v. Commissioner, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">But the appellants contend that in order to come within the scope of Section two of the Act of June 20, 1936, supra, the lands must have been \u201cheretofore purchased out of trust or restricted funds of said Indian\u201d, and that since March 4, 1931, and particularly for the taxable years 1936 and 1937, the lands sought to be taxed were held not by the restricted Indian whose trust or restricted funds purchase the land, but by the grantees of the said Indian as a gift; that none of the lands was purchased by the restricted funds of the appellees, hence they do not come within the purview of the Act declaring a government instrumentality.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">It is true that no trust or restricted funds of the appellees were invested in the lands in question. The appellees held the same as a gift from their mother, whose trust or restricted funds were used to purchase same, and it may be admitted that when considered by its technical language, without regard to its natural meaning or purpose, and without relation to the amendment (May 19, 1937), there is cause for doubt concerning the application of the original act to lands, the title to which has passed from the Indian whose trust or restricted funds purchased the same. But when, on March 4, 1931, Wosey John, now Deere, conveyed the lands to the appellees, she, by express language in the deed of conveyance, retained unto herself a life estate, together with the improvements thereon and the rents and profits therefrom. She warranted the title against judgments, taxes, liens, and encumbrances of whatsoever nature. As such life tenant, she held the dominant and taxable estate, and it was her statutory duty to pay all lawful taxes levied against the land so long as she retained the life estate. Revised Laws of Oklahoma of 1910 \u00a7 6644, 60 O.S.A. \u00a7 69; Helm v. Belvin, 107 Okl. 214, 232 P. 382; Riley v. Collier, 111 Okl. 130, 238 P. 491; Waldon v. Baker, 184 Okl 492, 88 P.2d 352; Tiffany on Real Property, Vol. 1, \u00a7 63; Rothschild v. Weinthel, 191 Ind. 85, 131 N.E. 917, 132 N.E. 687, 17 A.L.R. 1384; Thayer v. Shorey, 287 Mass. 76, 191 N.E. 435, 94 A.L.R. 311.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-8\">It follows that she is entitled to the tax immunity granted by the Act whilst she owned the dominant estate, and the appellees, as vested remaindermen, are entitled to the benefits of the tax immunity which attached to the land while Wosey John, now Deere, held the life estate therein. Since Wosey John, now Deere, retained the life estate until December 10, 1937, and until after the effective date of the amendatory Act of May 19, 1937, all the lands in question were immune from taxation for the period during which the original Act is applicable as \u201clands * * * heretofore purchased out of trust or restricted funds of said Indian\u201d. When, on December 10, 1937, Wosey John, now Deere, conveyed her life estate in the lands to the appellees, and the appellees became <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>obligated, to pay all lawful taxes assessed against the land, the Congress had previously and on May 19, 1937, eliminated the ambiguity provoking language contained in the original act by declaring that all homesteads heretofore purchased with trust or restricted funds of an <em>individual Indian, </em>restricted against alienation without the approval of the Secretary of the Interior, were instrumentalities of the Federal Government and exempt from all taxes, provided the homestead was selected in accordance with the amendment. Consequently, the homestead, when designated, is embraced within the amendatory Act of May 19, 1937, and is exempt from taxation for the period during which it is applicable. The agricultural lands were selected and designated as a homestead by the appellees on December 16, 1937, six days after acquisition of title thereto on December 10, 1937. The designation was not formally approved by the Secretary of the Interior until March 4, 1938, but we think the formal approval by the Secretary related back to the date of the designation.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">The taxable year in Oklahoma is the fiscal year and begins July first and not January first. Real estate is assessable in the name of the owner thereof on January first of any year, and the taxes thus assessed are levied as of July first of the same year, which is the beginning of the current, fiscal, and taxable year. In re Texas Company\u2019s Assessment, 168 Okl. 94, 31 P.2d 929. Real estate assessable in the name of the owner on January first of any year does not change its taxable status or become exempt from taxation for the ensuing taxable year beginning July first, because it acquired a nontaxable character between the date of the assessment on January first and the date of the levy on the following July first. Board of Commissioners of Comanche County v. Central Baptist Church, 136 Okl. 99, 276 P. 726, 63 A.L.R. 1327, as corrected In re Texas Company\u2019s Assessment, supra, 31 P.2d page 931. The taxable status of all property in Oklahoma is fixed as of January first of each year for the ensuing taxable year beginning July first, and its status as fixed on that date is not changed by intervening circumstances affecting its taxability between the date of the assessment and the levy date. In re Assessment of Champlin Refining Company, 186 Okl. 625, 99 P.2d 880. It follows that property not assessable as of January first of any year, because exempt from taxation, is nontaxable for the following fiscal and taxable year beginning July first, although it may have become subject to taxation between the assessment date on January first and the levy date on the following July first. In re Sinclair Prairie Oil Company, 175 Okl. 289, 53 P.2d 221, 229. See, also, In re Assessment of Champlin Refining Company, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">The exemption granted here is based upon the power of the Federal Government to create a Federal instrumentality out of lands heretofore taxable by the State of Oklahoma, and to immunize them against state taxation. But there is nothing in the acts here involved indicating an intention or purpose to disrupt the orderly procedure by which the State of Oklahoma pursues its statutory scheme of taxation, so long as such procedure does not circumvent or proscribe the declared purpose of the national enactment. We see no reason here to depart from the orderly procedure as outlined by the state law in the determination of the period in which the respective exempting acts have application to the lands embraced within the compass of the Acts. The right to be vindicated is a Federal right, but state laws have a distinct relevancy and they are entitled to a respectful consideration. Their observance here will result in a synchronization of state and Federal law and give vitality to both, while to ignore them would result in doubt and confusion. Board of Commissioners of Jackson County v. United States, 308 U.S. 343, 60 S.Ct. 285, 84 L.Ed. 313; Cf. United States v. Alabama, 313 U.S. 274, 61 S.Ct. 1011, 85 L.Ed. 1327.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-7\">When measured by this rule, all of the lands in question were subject to taxation and therefore assessable on January 1, 1936, on which date the taxable status was fixed; they were therefore subject to taxation on the levy date which was July 1, 1936 for the ensuing taxable year ending June 30, 1937, although declared exempt from state taxation on June 20, 1936.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-8\">By the same rule, all of the lands in question, having been declared exempt from taxation on June 20, 1936, were not subject to taxation by the state, therefore nonassessable on January 1, 1937, for the ensuing fiscal and taxable year beginning July 1, 1937. The lands were therefore exempt from taxation for the taxable year <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>beginning July 1, 1937. In re Sinclair Prairie Oil Company, supra; In re Assessment of Champlin Refining Company, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">On January 1, 1938, all of the lands, except the designated homestead, were assessable for taxation because nonexempt under the amendatory Act of May 19, 1937, and the homestead having been selected in accordance with the amendment by the appellees on December 16, 1937, was exempt from taxation for the taxable year beginning July 1, 1938, and thereafter, so long as restricted against alienation without the approval of the Secretary of the Interior or until otherwise directed by Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">It is also contended that since the appellees did not pursue the statutory remedy provided by Section 12665, O.S.1931, 68 O.S.A. \u00a7\u00a7 263\u201415.49 and 15.50), which remedy is exclusive, they may not by these proceedings recover the taxes paid without protest. But it is true, as the appellants concede, that the appellees were put to the choice of either paying the taxes assessed and levied against the property, or having the lands sold to satisfy the same as provided by the laws of Oklahoma. The taxes were therefore not paid voluntarily, but under compulsion and duress. Ward v. Board of County Com\u2019rs of Love County, supra, 253 U.S. page 24, 40 S.Ct. 419, 64 L.Ed. 751; Carpenter v. Shaw, supra, 280 U.S. page 369, 50 S.Ct. 121, 74 L.Ed. 478. \u201cThis exemption is not subject to violation by the state tax laws or administrative officials, directly or indirectly. So far as the state taxing power is concerned, the exempt lands do not exist\u201d, and to the extent herein observed, \u201cThe land is as effectively without the pale of the tax laws and their administration as if they were located in another state. All proceedings of the taxing power, having as their effect a violation of this exemption, are without jurisdiction and void, * * *\u201d. Hutchison v. Brown, 66 Okl. 250, 167 P. 624, 628. See, also, Johnson v. Jackson, 156 Okl. 148, 9 P.2d 950.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">The above authorities relate to a tax deed covering tax exempt lands, but we think the principle has application here. It follows that the right to recover taxes, illegal and void because beyond the jurisdiction of the taxing authorities, cannot be made to depend upon any procedural requirements of the State of Oklahoma, the effect of which would deny a vested right of immunity granted by a law of the United States. Carpenter v. Shaw, supra. See, also, Board of Commissioners of Jackson County v. United States, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-9\">The contention with reference to the statute of limitations need not be noticed since we hold that all of the lands involved here were not exempt from taxation for the taxable year beginning July 1, 1936 and ending June 30, 1937, hence the taxes levied, assessed, and paid for this period, together with the penalties, were lawful and not recoverable. All other taxes assessed and paid, and held to be illegal and void, are concededly within the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-10\">We conclude that the trial court erroneously granted a recovery for the taxes and penalties for the taxable year beginning July 1, 1936; furthermore the allowance of interest on the taxes paid, held to be illegal and void, is disallowed under the authority of Board of Commissioners of Jackson County v. United States, supra; Bryan County v.

The court, however, was careful to state (221 U.S. 574 [31 S.Ct. 688, 55 L.Ed. 853]): \u2018It may well happen that Congress should embrace in an enactment introducing a new state into the Union legislation intended as a regulation of commerce among the states, or with Indian tribes situated within the limits of such new state, or regulations touching the sole care and disposition of the public lands or reservations therein, which might be upheld as legislation within the sphere of the plain power of Congress. But in every such case such legislation would derive its force not from any agreement or compact with the proposed new state, nor by reason of its acceptance of such enactment as a term of admission, but solely because <em>the power of Congress extended to the subject, </em>and therefore would not operate to restrict the state\u2019s legislative power in respect of any matter which was not plainly within the regulating power of Congress\u2019\u201d.

The developed responsibility has been indicated. The electorate of the state of Oklahoma for three consecutive terms elected a member of the Five Civilized Tribes to the United States Senate, and two different members of said tribes to the lower house of the Congress of the United States, one consecutively for ten terms and the other for ten terms with an interim of one term. Four members of said tribes have been elected and re-elected district judge, one of them elevated by the electorate to the Supreme Court of the state and now serving as Chief Justice, and two of the others are still continuing as district judges, and the other holds some responsible appointive position in the Interior Department in Washington. One was elected and served a full term as Secretary of State, and another is entering upon his third consecutive term by election as Clerk of the Supreme Court. Two members of said tribes have been speaker of the House of Representatives of the legislature and another president pro tempore of the Senate of the legislature, and members of said tribes have on many occasions and repeatedly been elected to the State Senate and the lower house of the legislature, and the county offices, including county judge, have been many times and repeatedly filled by election from members of the Five Civilized Tribes. In the business sphere the Five Civilized Tribes have engaged in banking, merchandising, ranching, law, medicine, and education. Mitchell v. Metcalf &amp; Eddy, supra; Shaw v.

The Congress had not recently authorized the Secretary of the Interior to purchase lands for them or any of them. As one of the Five Civilized Tribes, lands were allotted to their members by the Government, under the Creek <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>treaty, including all full blood allottees and their heirs and they still own said lands except as restrictions have been removed and such owners permitted to sell same, and that has occurred among the Creeks only in rare and exceptional cases. Under the treaties and facts hereinbefore set forth, such Creek lands, consisting of full blood allotments, have been nontaxable prior to April 26, 1931, and the lands which have been purchased from their restricted funds under the decisions hereinbefore cited were taxable not only before such purchase where' restrictions had ceased, or been removed, and after 25 years from April 26, 1906, which would be April 26, 1931, unless reimposed. Under the said acts of April 12, 1926, and May 10, 1928, Congress continued in applicable cases not only restrictions but also nontaxability not exceeding 160 acres, held by an allottee after April 26, 1931. That would cover the original allotted lands of Wosey John Deere, but a serious question arises as to whether after the tax exemption had expired under the treaty provision and limitation it was in the power of Congress to extend the exemption as to taxation. It is not essential here to determine that question in order to dispose of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-4\">The land acquired by inheritance by a full blood under such conditions as it would be restricted after April 26, 1931, as well as the lands purchased under the supervision of the Secretary of the Interior with restricted funds, such land under such a state of facts could be considered as restricted by reimposition, but not to be exempt from taxation either as to such allottee or unenrolled full blood born after March 4, 1906.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">Section 2 of said act of June 20, 1936, as amended by act of May 19, 1937, is not applicable to the lands here involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">The word \u201chomestead\u201d as used in this statute, if intended to apply to the Five Civilized Tribes whose members were citizens of Oklahoma and also of the United States, would have contemplated a homestead as defined by state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">Section 1, Article 12, Constitution of Oklahoma, provides that:</p>\n<p id=\"b743-8\">\u201cThe homestead of any family in this State, not within any city, town, or village, shall consist of not more than one hundred and sixty acres of land, which may be in one or more parcels, to be selected by the owner.

To have and to hold said described premises unto said grantees, their heirs, and assigns, forever, free, clear, and discharged of all former grants, charges, taxes, judgments, mortgages, and other liens and encumbrances of whatsoever nature, subject to the condition that no lease, deed, mortgage, power of attorney, contract to sell, or other instrument affecting the land herein described or the title thereto shall be of any force and eff\u00e9ct, unless approved by the Secretary of the Interior or the restrictions from said land are otherwise removed by operation of law,\u201d substantially identical with the clause contained in Exhibit D, deed executed by her to appellees dated March 4, 1931.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-12\">Section 69, Title 60, Okl.St.Ann. 60 O.S. 1941 \u00a7 69, provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b744-13\">\u201cThe owner of a life estate must keep the buildings and fences in repair from ordinary waste, and must pay the taxes and other annual charges, and a just proportion of extraordinary assessments benefiting the whole inheritance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b744-14\">Under deed of December 10, 1937, when properly approved by the Interior Department, the complete title vested in the appellees, and the question may arise as to her liability under the warranty therein for any encumbrances remaining thereon for taxes, though such warranty was executed as a pure gift. Claim of the appellees against the' mother or the estate of the mother, according to the record, has not been set up, but such claim for exemption of the land from state taxation until Congress otherwise provides was presented, not by virtue of a mandatory provision of the Creek treaty, and thereby with a guaranty on part of the United States Government. If appellees prevail it must be by strict construction in application of the facts under act of June 20, 1936, Section 2, providing \u201clands * \u25a0 * * heretofore purchased out of trust or restricted funds of the said Indian, are hereby declared to be instrumentalities of the Federal Government and shall be nontaxable until otherwise directed by Congress.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b744-15\">The lands described in Exhibits A, B, and C <em>were not heretofore purchased by the trust or restricted funds of appellees for appellees, but out of such funds of Wosey John Deere, by and for her, </em>and the eighty-acre tract as a home for her\u2014not as an original homestead but for a home for her. She already had an allotment homestead, burdened with the production of oil, with tax exemption, and it may be assumed that it was not suitable for a home on account of oil production, as it was purchased for a home for her. All lands described -in said deeds, none being part in any way of her allotment, were purchased by and for her and not for any one else.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-16\">Section 2 of Act of June 20, 1936, as amended by Act of May 19, 1937, 25 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 412a, provided that <em>\u201call homesteads, heretofore purchased out of the trust or restricted funds of individual Indians, are </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number><em>hereby declared to be instrumentalities of the Federal Government and shall be nontaxable until otherwise directed by Corn-grass: </em>[emphasis supplied] Provided, That the title to such homesteads shall be held subject to restrictions against alienation or encumbrance except with the approval of the Secretary of the Interior: And provided further, That the Indian owner or owners shall select, with the approval of the Secretary of the Interior, either the agricultural and grazing lands, not exceeding a total of one hundred and sixty acres, or the village, town, or city property, not exceeding in cost $5,000, to be designated <em>as a homestead </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">The lands described in Exhibits A, B and C were not purchased with restricted trust funds of appellees, but from restricted funds of the mother, and the mother having on March 4, 1931 conveyed said restricted lands to said appellees retaining \u201call the rents and profits to be derived from all of the above property as long as she lives, that is, grantor retains a life estate in all of the real estate described in this deed, together with all the improvements thereon and such appurtenances thereunto belonging, and warrant the title to the same\u201d and subsequently on, and after May 19, 1937, December 10, 1937 had conveyed all of her life estate theretofore reserved by her in all of said lands together with all improvements thereon and the appurtenances thereunto belonging and warrant the title to the same,\u201d then the appellees were not justified under the facts of the record and of which we take judicial knowledge and the law to designate that 87% acres, all of it except the town lots, <em>as a homestead </em>jointly for appellees, not having theretofore been purchased out of restricted funds of said appellees, then to say in order to place that property in favor of these three unenrolled full blood Indians\u2014not enrolled members of the Creek tribe\u2014in a status as being immune from taxation until Congress shall otherwise provide, that said Section 69, Title 60, Okl. Stat.Ann., 60 O.S.1941 \u00a7 69, supra, requiring the holder of a life estate to \u201ckeep the buildings and fences in repair from ordinary waste, and must pay the taxes and other annual charges, and a just proportion of extraordinary assessments benefiting the whole inheritance,\u201d when her estate would be liable for a breach of that statutory provision though their claim would be without any actual consideration other than love and affection for the warranty, that immunity 'from taxation cannot be sustained on the question of relation.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-7\">In Nos. 2558, 2559, 2560, United States v. Oklahoma Tax Commission, pending in the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, this court takes judicial knowledge of contents of records in said cases, and inheritance or transfer or excise tax as provided by the Oklahoma statute as therein disclosed to be claimed, involves $359,643 of restricted funds in custody of Secretary of Interior from estate of Wosey John Deere, full blood Creek woman killed in an automobile accident September 2, 1938, on which the Oklahoma State Tax Commission recovered such excise tax thereon in sum of $14,908 under judgment of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Oklahoma, which the United States, as appellant, seeks in this court in said cases to have vacated on review.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-8\">Under application of the plea of relation, such immunity from taxation may not be allowed. Such relation does not arise except on account of a consideration therefor, or an equity would have to exist on the part of appellees, which is not shown here. Godfrey v. Iowa Land &amp; Trust Co., 21 Okl. 293, 95 P. 792, 797; Stark v. Starrs, 6 Wall. 402, 18 L.Ed. 925; Jones v. Meehan, 175 U.S. 1, 4, 20 S.Ct. 1, 2, 44 L.Ed. 49, 51; Wallace v. Adams, 204 U.S. 415, 419, 27 S.Ct. 363, 51 L.Ed. 547.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-9\">The land restricted in the mother out of pure love and affection was by her donated to the appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-10\">This court takes judicial knowledge of the fact that the inherited restricted estate of Wosey John Deere in the custody of the Secretary of the Interior on September 2, 1938 amounted to $359,643 and the record shows that these appellees were her heirs, and to say that appellees are not required to present a claim for that and collect same, but on the doctrine of relation that they shall have a right to be released from state taxes thereon until Congress otherwise provides in effect results in violating the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-11\">The date of the judgment is July 17, 1941, from which this appeal is prosecuted. Neither the United States nor the Secretary of the Interior nor any governmental agency was a party thereto either in the trial or appellate court nor has any appearance in any respect been herein made. An individual action brought by allottees or members <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>of the Five Civilized Tribes with no appearance in any way whatever on the part of the United States, the statute of limitations and mandatory preliminary requirements as to state procedure applies. In Broadwell v. Board of Commissioners of Bryan County, 88 Okl. 147, 211 P. 1040, certiorari denied 262 U.S. 750, 43 S.Ct. 525, 67 L.Ed. 214, it was held that the statute of limitations in such a case constituted a bar to the parties thereto. See, also, Ward v. Board of County Com\u2019rs of Love County, 253 U.S. 17, 40 S.Ct. 419, 64 L.Ed. 751; Carter v. Collins, 174 Okl. 4, 50 P.2d 203; Antrim Lumber Co. v. Sneed, 175 Okl. 47, 52 P.2d. 1040. As to an action thereafter brought by the United States for the use or benefit of any such party neither the statute of limitations nor said preliminary state statutory procedure applied. Bryan County v. United States, 10 Cir., 123 F.2d 782, certiorari denied 62 S.Ct. 907, 86 L.Ed.-.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">Act of June 11, 1940, 54 Stat. 298, and of February 10, 1942, 25 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 352c, provided for reimbursement to Indian allottees or Indian heirs or Indian devisees of allottees for taxes paid including interest paid on so much of their restricted allotted lands as may have been patented in fee and restrictions not to expire prior to the expiration of the twenty-five year period of trust, and that does not apply to any lands of the members of the Five Civilized Tribes but to Indians that received allotments and patents under the General Allotment Act of February 8, 1887, 24 Stat. 388, 25 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 331 et seq., in cases in which a claim against a state, county or political subdivision for taxes collected upon such land during the trust period, which was the twenty-five year trust period, later extended, under the allotments made under said act of February 8, 1887.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">No trust restricted funds of appellees or either of them were invested in said realty as to which the taxes were here involved. The eighty acres included in Exhibit C was purchased by the Secretary of the Interior as a home for the mother out of her restricted funds described in the conveyance with a warranty by Wosey John, now Deere, on March 4, 1931 to appellees jointly, retaining in herself a life estate including therefrom proceeds from rents and profits. If it was her statutory duty to pay the lawful taxes thereon her estate was amply able to meet such liability. Appellees must bring themselves within the express terms of the statute and within a strict construction thereof as no other reasonable conclusion can be reached therefrom sustaining such right on their part, and the application of the doctrine of relation in Indian matters is not justified by this record.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-7\">Evelyn Seber, otherwise designated as Osharsha John, Jimmie Powshiek and Juanita Deere, now McIntosh, all born to said Wosey John Deere after March 4, 1906, and unenrolled, are her heirs and by inheritance participate in all of her estate including her allotted realty consisting of a forty-acre original homestead and the additional part of said original allotment, all restricted, and also her restricted inherited allotted Creek lands, including restricted royalties and restricted funds, from all of her land, all held by the Secretary of the Interior as such restricted funds and realty for her benefit at and prior to September 2, 1938, the date of her death occasioned by an automobile accident, and said three unenrolled full blood heirs participate by inheritance therein and after September 2, 1938, the Secretary holds in trust their respective inheritance, which may rest under another status. Landman, Supt., v. Com\u2019r of Internal Revenue, 10 Cir., 123 F.2d 787.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-8\">The applicability of federal instrumentalities constituting estate tax immunity is to be applied only by a strict construction. Under the Farm Security Administration, money is made available by loan from federal funds to acquire non-urban homes and also vast sums of money have been advanced under the Federal Housing Administration as to urban homes. Under the Farm Security Administration money has. been furnished to members of the Five Civilized Tribes, whose restrictions expired by operation of law, and their allotments had been lost, and as to persons who had received free homes or homesteads in what was formerly known as Oklahoma Territory, and had been lost, to acquire homes upon which these Government agencies hold liens for these vast advancements or guaranties, and the occasion may arise when Congress, supported by public sentiment, will pass a like act for relief as to-such holders of non-urban homes as well as urban homes, providing that same will be immune from state taxation, denominating same as a federal instrumentality. Then the question would arise as to whether that was an extension of the ruling in this case. A strict construction should here be followed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>By Joint Resolution, Congress extended the tribal existence and government of the Five Civilized Tribes of Indians in the Indian Territory (S.J.Res. 37, March 2, 1906, 34 Stat. 822; Laws Relating to the Five Civilized Tribes in Oklahoma [1890-1914], p. 524), as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">\u201cResolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That the tribal existence and present tribal governments of the Choctaw, Chickasaw, Cherokee, Creek, and Seminole tribes or nations of Indians in the Indian Territory are hereby continued in full force and effect for all purposes under existing laws <em>until all property of such tribes, or the proceeds thereof, </em>shall be distributed among the individual members of said tribes unless hereafter otherwise provided by law.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">Later in act of April 26, 1906, 34 Stat. 137, the last Section (28) of said Act, other than repealing part, is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">\u201cThat the tribal existence and present tribal governments of the Choctaw, Chickasaw, Cherokee, Creek, and Seminole tribes or nations are hereby continued in full force and effect for all purposes authorized by law, until otherwise provided by law, but the tribal council or legislature in any of said tribes or nations shall not be in session for a longer period than thirty days in any one year: Provided, That no act, ordinance, or resolution (except resolutions of adjournment) of the tribal council or legislature of any of said tribes or nations shall be of any validity until approved by the President of the United States: Provided further, That no contract involving the payment or expenditure of any money or affecting any property belonging to any of said tribes or nations made by them or any of them or by any officer thereof, shall be of any validity until approved by the President of the United States.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b747-9\">Reference has been made herein to the fact that this suit has been brought by the appellees, three non-enrolled but full United States and state citizens\u2014-full blood Creek Indians\u2014without the United States Government in any way appearing, and that under such facts the statute of limitations and mandatory preliminary procedure apply-</p>\n<p id=\"b747-10\">In Helvering v. Mountain Producers Corp., 303 U.S. 376, 58 S.Ct. 623, 627, 82 L.Ed. 907, it is stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b747-11\">\u201cThe power to tax should not be crippled \u2018by extending the constitutional exemption from taxation to those subjects which fall within the general application of non-discriminatory laws, and where no direct burden is laid upon the governmental instrumentality, and there is only remote, if any, influence upon the exercise of the functions of government.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b747-12\">Under the <em>state </em>homestead exemption statute, every homestead as therein defined is in effect exempt from taxation up to the assessed value of $1,000 and where it exceeds that it is only taxable for the assessed sum in excess of an assessed $1,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-13\">These appellees under this record are not entitled jointly to tax exemption on the 87% acres land designated as <em>a homestead </em>for the three appellees under act of Congress, but may when facts justify have assistance or credit under the state act hereinbefore set out.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-14\">In the conclusion of the majority opinion insofar as the judgment of the trial court grants a recovery for the taxes and penalties for the taxable year beginning July 1, 1936, was erroneous, to that extent I concur, and also in the conclusion that allowance of interest on the taxes paid should not be permitted, but I further conclude the judgment of the trial court in toto should also be reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b733-5\"> Clinkenbeard v.

The state of Oklahoma is not concerned, since there is no state statute, rule of law or policy, which has been called to our attention, to the contrary effect. If there were, or if the power of state taxation were involved, we should consider the <em>question of supremacy of poioer; </em>but no such question is presented by this record.\u201d (Emphasis supplied) Sunderland v.
