We think the court erred. For, as it found, the parties \u201crelying on said ceremonial marriage lived together as husband and wife in the District of Columbia for more than two years preceding\u201d the filing of appellant\u2019s complaint. In this jurisdiction, \u201cthe removal of an impediment while parties continue to live together as husband and wife gives rise to a common-law marriage.\u201d Thomas v. Murphy, 71 App.D.C. 69, 70, 107 F.2d 268. Parrella v. Parrella, 74 App.D.C. 161, 120 F.2d 728. We need not consider questions of estoppel, laches, and waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-21\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
