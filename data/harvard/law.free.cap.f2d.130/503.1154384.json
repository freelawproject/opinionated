HAND, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b564-19\">The Board\u2019s order in this case enjoined the respondent company in the usual form from interfering with an unaffiliated union of its employees, called \u201cThe Peter Cailler Kohler Union\u201d\u2014which we shall speak of as \u201cThe P. C. K.\u201d\u2014and directed it to reinstate with back pay an employee, named Whipple, whom it had discharged, and who at that time\u2014September, 1940\u2014was, and for some time before had been, president of \u201cThe P. C. K.\u201d The Board based its order partly upon findings that the company had long harbored hostility towards unions and Whipple as their promoter, and that this finally culminated in the discharge. These findings we shall not, however, consider, as we should be obliged to do if we thought the excuse given for his dismissal adequate. In that event we should have to decide whether there was evidence to support the conclusion that the excuse, though the avowed reason, was not the real one. Since we think that the excuse was itself invalid, we need go no further.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-20\">The company uses large quantities of milk in making its product; and to secure this cheaply it had for many years before 1938 been under contract with the Dairymen\u2019s League to accept all the League\u2019s \u201csurplus\u201d milk; that is, all the milk which the League did not dispose of to its ordinary customers. It resulted that in seasons of high yield the League sold large quantities of milk to the company, and that in seasons of low yield the company was forced to use substitutes. Thus, by insuring a full market to the League at peak, and by never demanding any part of the supply which the League could sell elsewhere, the company got its milk at substantially lower prices. The Dairymen\u2019s League is a cooperative association of farmers who pool their milk and sell it collectively; the Dairy Farmers\u2019 Union \u2014which we shall call \u201cThe Union\u201d\u2014is another similar association; both operate in the Mohawk Valley from which the company\u2019s milk comes, and in which its factory is situated. Both associations are made up only of farmers in the dairy business; neither is, or has any relations with, a labor union; each is merely a cooperative group of producers organized to sell their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>milk on the best possible terms. They are competitors, and \u201cThe Union\u201d was very hostile to the League.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">In August, 1939, \u201cThe Union\u201d declared a \u201cmilk strike,\u201d or\u2014as it called it\u2014a \u201cmilk holiday,\u201d by which it tried to raise the price by withholding the supply from the cities, particularly New York. The chocolate company helped the Dairymen\u2019s League in its successful effort to defeat this \u201cstrike\u201d; it used substitutes in its own manufacture so as to release milk for the League to take the place of \u201cThe Union\u2019s\u201d milk, and it allowed the League to use its cooling plant and its trucks. In September, 1940, \u201cThe Union\u201d proposed another \u201cmilk holiday,\u201d and on September 28th Whipple called a meeting of \u201cThe P. C. K.\u201d to take some action. Very few members attended, and there was some reason to suppose that he called the meeting only to promote his election for the office of county clerk, for which he was running on the ticket of the American Labor Party. However, as the Board has found that the action taken at the meeting was a genuine expression of those present, including Whipple, and as its decision is supported by substantial evidence, we must take it that the action was in good faith. A resolution was passed which we quote in the margin.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> When the resolution was published in the local newspapers, the company considered it a grave injury to its business, which perhaps it was; and dismissed Whipple as the moving spirit. The sole question is whether he and the others who passed the resolution were acting within their right \u201cto engage in concerted activities, for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection.\u201d \u00a7 157, Title 29 U.S.C.A.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">The company argues that the National Labor Relations Act was designed to protect only mutual relations between \u201cemployees,\u201d as \u00a7 2(3) defines that word; and that, since \u201cThe Union\u201d was not made up of \u201cemployees,\u201d \u00a7 7 did not sanction \u201cThe P. C. K.\u2019s\u201d action in its support. Both the text and the purpose of the act show this position to be untenable. It is of course true that only those \u201cemployees\u201d can invoke \u00a7 7, who are defined by \u00a7 2(3), and that therefore the members of \u201cThe Union\u201d could not do so. It follows that, so far as the resolution was a \u201cconcerted activity\u201d for the \u201cmutual aid or protection\u201d of the farmers on the one hand and the members of \u201cThe P. C. K.\u201d on the other, the section did not cover it. So far, however, as it was a \u201cconcerted activity for the purpose\u201d of the \u201cmutual aid or protection\u201d of the members of \u201cThe P. C. K.\u201d themselves, the section did cover it, though perhaps the more accurate word in that situation would have been \u201ccommon\u201d instead of \u201cmutual.\u201d Certainly nothing elsewhere in the act limits the scope of the language to \u201cactivities\u201d designed to benefit other \u201cemployees\u201d; and its rationale forbids such a limitation. When all the other workmen in a shop make common cause with a fellow workman over his separate grievance, and go out on strike in his support, they engage in a \u201cconcerted activity\u201d for \u201cmutual aid or protection,\u201d although the aggrieved workman is the only one of them who has any immediate stake in the outcome. The rest know that by their action each one of them assures himself, in case his turn ever comes, of the support of the one whom they are all then helping; and the solidarity so established is \u201cmutual aid\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>in the most literal sense, as nobody doubts. So too of those engaging in a \u201csympathetic strike,\u201d or secondary boycott; the immediate quarrel does not itself concern them, but by extending the number of those who will make the enemy of one the enemy of all, the power of each is vastly increased. It is one thing how far a community should allow such power to grow; but, whatever may be the proper place to check it, each separate extension is certainly a step in \u201cmutual aid or protection.\u201d Cf. Fort Wayne Corrugated Paper Co. v. National Labor Relations Board, 7 Cir., 111 F.2d 869, 873, 874. It is true that in the past courts often failed to recognize the interest which each might have in a solidarity so obtained (e. g. Duplex Printing Press Co. v. Deering, 254 U.S. 443, 471, 472, 474, 41 S.Ct. 172, 65 L.Ed. 349, 16 A.L.R. 196), but it seems to us that the act has put an end to this.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">If, therefore, the members of \u201cThe P. C. K.\u201d thought that the resolution might help to secure for them the favor of \u201cThe Union,\u201d it was no objection that \u201cThe Union\u201d was not made up of \u201cemployees\u201d as \u00a7 2(3) defined that word; it was as little an objection as though \u201cThe Union\u201d had been made up of agricultural laborers who were equally excluded from the act. \u201cThe P. C. K,\u201d might well believe that the support engendered by that favor might prove as important in future disputes with the chocolate company as the support of other unions in its own craft or in other crafts. \u201cThe Union\u201d might put as much pressure on the company as \u201cThe P. C. K.\u201d itself at any rate it would be a valuable reinforcement. We agree that the act does not excuse \u201cconcerted activities,\u201d themselves independently unlawful. National Labor Relations Board v. Fansteel Metallurgical Corp., 306 U.S. 240, 59 S.Ct. 490, 83 L.Ed. 627, 123 A.L.R. 599; National Labor Relations Board v. Sands Manufacturing Co., 306 U.S. 332, 344, 59 S.Ct. 508, 83 L.Ed. 682; Southern Steamship Company v. National Labor Relations Board, 316 U.S. 31, 62 S.Ct. 886, 86 L.Ed.-; Hazel-Atlas Glass Co. v. National Labor Relations Board, 4 Cir., 127 F.2d 109, 118. But so long as the \u201cactivity\u201d is not unlawful, we can see no justification for making it the occasion for a discharge; a union may subsidize propaganda, distribute broadsides, support political movements, and in any other way further its cause or that of others whom it wishes to win to its side. Such activities may be highly prejudicial to its employer; his customers may refuse to deal with him, he may incur the enmity of many in the community whose disfavor will bear hard upon him; but the statute forbids him by a discharge to rid himself of those who lay such burdens upon him. Congress has weighed the conflict of his interest with theirs, and has pro tanto shorn him of his powers. Unless therefore the resolution was itself a wrong against the chocolate company, Whipple\u2019s discharge was an \u201cunfair labor practice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b566-8\"> The company says that it was a libel. Under the law of New York as at common-law generally (Restatement of Torts \u00a7 561(1), Comment a), a corporation which sues for defamation must show that the words may tend to injure its credit or affect its business. First National Bank v. Winters, 225 N.Y. 47, 121 N.E. 459; New York Society, etc., v. MacFadden Publications, 260 N.Y. 167, 183 N.E. 284, 86 A. L.R. 440; Hernando Plantation Co. v. Slovak Press, Inc., 223 App.Div. 286, 228 N.Y.S. 194. The company argues that the resolution conformed to this requirement because a jury could read it as charging the company with using \u201cvile and vicious means\u201d against \u201cThe Union.\u201d The resolution did declare that there were \u201ccontrolling powers\u201d which had used \u201cvile and vicious means\u201d in 1939 to \u201cnullify\u201d \u201cThe Union,\u201d and that the chocolate company had then aided \u201cforces\u201d which opposed \u201cThe Union.\u201d Presumably those \u201cforces\u201d were also the \u201cpowers\u201d who used the \u201cvile and vicious means\u201d; and we agree that the resolution did not mitigate whatever defamatory character it might have had, by saying that the company aided the \u201cforces,\u201d \u201cintentionally or unintentionally.\u201d But nobody reading the whole would naturally understand that the company was charged with knowing that the \u201cforces\u201d used the \u201cvile and vicious means\u201d; and certainly nobody could understand that it had itself used such \u201cmeans.\u201d The supposed libel came to no more than that the company had helped those who were trying to defeat the \u201cdairy farmers\u201d; and that those whom it had so helped were themselves bad people. The first part of this was true, and the second was certainly too venial to serve as a libel. We need not therefore consider whether the interest of \u201cThe P. C. K.\u201d in passing the resolution was enough to make the publication privileged; in any light it did not justify Whipple\u2019s discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-9\">The usual order will enter.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b565-7\"> \u201cWhereas These farmers have banded together in their DAIRY FARMERS UNION, and succeeded, to some measure, in lifting their yoke of oppression: and</p>\n<p id=\"A3Q\">\u201cWhereas The controlling powers and trusts have employed every vile and vicious means in their efforts to stop organization and nullify the effectiveness of the DAIRY FARMERS UNION; and</p>\n<p id=\"Aam\">\u201cWhereas The Peter Callier Kohlier Company (sic), whether intentionally or unintentionally, aided and abetted the forces opposed to the DAIRY F\u00cdARMERS UNION during the strike of 1939 by conditioning and transferring milk for the metropolitan market which ordinarily is used in the manufacture of milk chocolate and thereby helping to defeat the purpose of the dairy farmers:</p>\n<p id=\"b565-9\">\u201cNow, therefore, be it</p>\n<p id=\"Az\"><em>\u201cResolved, </em>That the workers of the Peter Callier Kohlier Co. register their protest to the management of this company on their action in regards to the 1939 strike of the DAIRY FARMERS UNION ; and be it further</p>\n<p id=\"Aok\"><em>\u201cResolved, </em>That these workers here assembled go on record for complete and unqualified solidarity with the DAIRY FARMERS UNION; and be it further</p>\n<p id=\"Aea\"><em>\u201cResolved, </em>That a copy of this resolution be sent to Mr. C.
