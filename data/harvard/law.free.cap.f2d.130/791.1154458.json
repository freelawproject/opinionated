They had received their shares from Warren Webster, Sr., who, upon the organization of the holding company in 1927 obtained all its shares for a bare majority of the stock of the operating company, Warren Webster and Company, incorporated in New Jersey in 1895. There is evidence in the record, although no express finding of fact by the Board, that the device of a holding company was chosen by Mr. Webster to insure that the control of the operating company remain in the hands of those active in its management and at the same time enable him to distribute non-controlling beneficial interests, the non-voting stock of the holding company which constituted half of its shares, to the members of his family and employees who at the time did not participate in its management or whose future relationship thereto was uncertain.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-12\">On October 28, 1935, the directors of the two corporations executed an \u201cAgreement of Merger and Consolidation\u201d. The agreement provided that the operating company was to be the surviving corporation. All \u201crights, privileges, powers and franchises\u201d of the holding company and \u201call [its] property, * * * except as otherwise provided in Article X\u201d were to vest in the survivor. Under the latter Article, all of the assets, with the exception of the shares of the operating company, were to be distributed as a dividend to the Shareholders of the holding company which was to transfer the shares it held in the operating company to the surviving corporation. There was an additional article which enumerated the powers of the surviving company.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-13\">After approval by the respective shareholders, the agreement was filed with the' Secretary of State of New Jersey. The respondents, in accordance with a provision of the agreement of merger, surrendered their holding company stock to the surviving corporation and received its shares in return. The holding company stock was thereupon cancelled. The Commissioner asserted that the respondents were taxable upon the gain resulting from this exchange. The Board of Tax Appeals, two members dissenting, did not sustain his position<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and he took 'this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-14\">Was There a Statutory Merger?</p>\n<p id=\"b852-15\">We reject without hesitation the Commissioner\u2019s first argument that there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>was no merger. Admonished by the argument that we should apply Congressional language in the ordinary sense we think that the term used by Congress \u201cstatutory merger or consolidation\u201d means, as Treasury Regulation 86, Art. 112(g)-2 states \u201ca merger or consolidation effected in pursuance of the corporation laws of a State or Territory or the District of Columbia\u201d. The Commissioner\u2019s argument, based upon the dissenting opinion of the Board contends that all of the definitions of the term \u201cmerger\u201d require that there be a transfer of property. There was no transfer of property, so it was argued, in the surrender by the holding company to the operating company of the shares of the latter corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">One may question whether this argument is now open to the Commissioner. A stipulation between the parties states that the \u201cAgreement of Merger and Consolidation\u201d was approved by the stockholders of the two companies in conformity with the general corporation law of the State of New Jersey and that the appropriate officers of the companies, following the requirements of the New Jersey statute filed the certificates with the appropriate official.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> However, this point need not be stressed to conclusion. Possibly all that was meant to be admitted was that certain of the statutory procedures were in fact followed. The conclusion that there was a statutory merger can stand upon other bases.</p>\n<p id=\"Ac2J\">The Board\u2019s finding of fact states that the officers of the companies followed the requirements of the statutes of New Jersey in filing their documents relative to the merger and that \u201cThe filing of those documents effected the merger of the two corporations.\u201d The New Jersey statutes provide for a certification by the Secretary of State of a copy of the agreement filed and that such certification \u201cshall be evidence of the existence of such new or consolidated corporation.\u201d N.J.S.A. 14:12-3. Such certification is part of the record in this case.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Ahs\">Furthermore, we can find no provision under the New Jersey Statutes on \u201cMerger or Consolidation\u201d, N.J.S.A. 14:12-1 et seq., which makes it a prerequisite to a merger that there be a transfer of property as contended by the Commissioner. Section 14:12-5 does provide that when a merger or consolidation is effected \u201call the rights, privileges, powers and franchises * * * all * * * property [etc.] shall vest in the consolidated corporation as effectually as they were vested in the several and respective former corporations.\u201d However, this falls far short of saying that if the absorbed corporation owned no property, it could not participate in a merger. Were the Commissioner\u2019s contention valid, then it would follow that a \u201cpure\u201d holding company could not become a party to a merger in New Jersey. No statute or decision of that State standing for this proposition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>has been cited to us; nor have we been able to find any to this effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-4\">We see no basis on which it can be held that the transaction here questioned was not a merger under the New Jersey statutes and, therefore, not a literal compliance with the Act of Congress within the definitions of the New Jersey statutes and within the definitions of Treasury Regulations construing the Act of Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">Was the Merger a Tax Free Transaction?</p>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">It is now settled that whether a transaction qualifies as a reorganization under the various Revenue Acts does not turn alone upon compliance with the literal language of the statute. The judicial interpretation has determined that something more may be needed and that, indeed, under some circumstances, something less will do.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Our concern in this case is the \u201csomething more\u201d since we have concluded that there was a literal compliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-7\">The starting point is Gregory v. Helvering, 1935, 293 U.S. 465, 55 S.Ct. 266, <em>79 </em>L.Ed. 596, 97 A.L.R. 1355.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The difference between that case and the one here to be decided is clear. The new corporation was set up for temporary purposes and dissolved when it had accomplished the purpose for which it was created, namely, to get part of the holdings of the old corporation into the hands of its shareholders. A distribution in fact was accomplished and the question was whether having made formal compliance with the statute the distribution escaped classification as a taxable event. Despite the petitioner\u2019s description of the events in the instant case as devious mechanics we see no such situation in this case as that presented in Gregory v. Helvering.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b854-12\">The reorganization provisions were enacted to free from the imposition of an income tax purely \u201cpaper profits or losses\u201d wherein there is no realization of gain or loss in the business sense but merely the recasting of the same interests in a different form, the tax being postponed to a future date when a more tangible gain or loss is realized.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This is recognized by the Treasury Regulations.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> They state that: \u201cThe purpose of the reorganization provisions * * * is to except from the general rule certain specifically described exchanges * * * which effect only a readjustment of continuing interests in property under modified corporate forms. Requisite to a reorganization under the Act are a continuity of the business enterprise under the modified corporate form, * * * continuity of interest therein on the part of those persons who were the owners of the enterprise prior to the reorganization.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b854-15\">In this case we have two corporations established long before the transaction in question, an operating company and a holding company. They desire to get rid of the holding company. The shareholders of the holding company were the majority owners of the operating company. By reason of the plan chosen they received the shares they had theretofore held indirectly through the holding company. There was no conversion into cash on withdrawal. Rather, the entire history of the two corporations reveals that the interests obtained through the merger <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>were to be continuing and the surviving corporation kept on doing business with no change in management or personnel after the merger.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We have, then, a genuine transaction in the sense that it was operating upon the situation of the companies as they stood. We have the continuity of uninterrupted corporate existence of the merged company and the interest of all prior owners therein, except, of course, of the dropping out of the holding company. Are there further requirements?</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">Argument for the Commissioner maintains that what has been done is still not enough. The result to be reached through this merger, it is said, could have been reached more directly by an out and out liquidation which, of course, would have been taxable under \u00a7 115(c).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Granted that the elimination of the holding company as a subject for taxation was a legitimate business object, it does not follow that the method taken in getting rid of it is a tax-free method.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We think this gets down to the proposition that if there are two ways of accomplishing a legitimate business result, one of which clearly creates a taxable transaction, one is equally subject to tax liability if he chooses the other unless there is an adequate business reason for the particular method used. We do not think this is the rule of the statute, the Regulations, nor, as we read them, the decisions.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The cases cited by the appellant do not extend the Gregory doctrine this far. In each of them, that which was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>attempted to be accomplished in a tax-free manner was not within the spirit and purpose of the reorganization provisions.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> On the other hand, in a recent case, the Supreme Court employed the Gregory principle to bring within the reorganization provisions a transaction which technically could have been excluded where basically there was present a continuity of interest but in a different form so that the transaction was within the spirit of the exemption provision.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> These authorities, we believe, support a negative answer to the question posed. Both parties have cited a group of cases arising out of the reorganization of the General Baking Company.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> While what transpired there as a result of the reorganization of the parent and subsidiary corporations was far more complicated, we find that the principle which withdrew them from the condemnation of Gregory v. Helvering underlies also the present case.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> As was said in one of those cases,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> the fact of there be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>ing a merger of a holding company with an operating company does not deny it the exemption provided by the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">Our conclusion is that what took place between these companies was a \u201creorganization in reality\u201d, to use the language of the court in the Gregory case, and that it complies with the statutes and the decisions under it.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">The decisions of the Board of Tax Appeals are affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b852-16\"> 26 U.S.C.A.

Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 2 Cir., 1935, 79 F.2d 14, 15, 101 A.L.R. 200, certiorari denied, 1935, 296 U.S. 641, 56 S.Ct. 174, 80 L.Ed. 456. Petitioner and four others transferred all the shares of an engineering corporation to a partnership which then performed the option given to another corporation to purchase them. After the sale the partnership continued to do business. The Commissioner sought to tax them then upon the sale, contending that the transaction was governed by Gregory v. Helvering. The court did not agree and said of the Gregory case, \u201cthe incorporators adopted the usual form for creating business corporations; but their intent, or purpose, was merely to draught the papers, in fact not to create corporations as the court understood that word. That was the purpose which defeated their exemption, not the accompanying purpose to escape taxation; that purpose was legally neutral. Had they really meant to conduct a business by means of the two reorganized companies, they would have escaped whatever other aim they might have had, whether to avoid taxes, or to regenerate the world.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b855-8\"> Revenue Act of 1934, 26 U.S.C.A.

The original purpose for the existence of the holding company, that the control of the operating company remain in those most active in its management, had been served and could be further fulfilled more satisfactorily by trusts and other means.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-11\">2. Holding companies were being regarded unfavorably by current legislation and taxing acts. This is in accordance with the Board\u2019s statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-12\">3. Corporate expenses, other than taxes would be decreased if there were only one corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-16\">4. A merger would be the most appropriate means of solving some of the problems encountered because some of the holding company stock was held by fiduciaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-17\">5.

As to the fifth, the Board stated that the merger did accomplish this. However, as the Commissioner pointed out, it does not appear that this is the fact. The merger agreement provided \u201cThe objects and purposes * * * shall include and be the objects and purposes for which Warren Webster and Company, * * * was formed, * * * and shall include the following objects: [enumerating]\u201d. This of course does not disclose what the powers of the operating company had been theretofore nor that the powers enumerated are new. Nor do other facts in the record supply this information.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b855-20\"> In considering such a question reliance is not to be placed too much on general statements either as to liability or non-liability, although equitable dicta are easily found. For example, \u201cWhere for legitimate business purposes a person has a choice of conducting his business transactions without tax liability, such a liability does not arise simply because it would have arisen if another process had been chosen.\u201d Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Kolb, 9 Cir., 1938, 100 F.2d 920, 926. One may match the petitioner\u2019s quotation that \u201cA given result at the end of a straight path is not made a different result because reached by following a devious path.\u201d (from the Minnesota Tea Co. v. Helvering case, infra, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>302 U.S. at page 613, 58 S.Ct. at page 395, 82 L.Ed. 474;) with \u201cThe legal right of a taxpayer to decrease the amount of what otherwise would be his taxes, or altogether avoid them, by means which the law permits, cannot be doubted.\u201d (from Gregory v. Helvering, supra, 293 U.S. at page 469, 55 S.Ct. at page 267, 79 L.Ed. 596, 97 A.L.R. 1355). Cf.

In two other cases, there was lacking the continuity of interest which would bring the transaction within the exemption provisions for the courts found that what really had been accomplished was a sale of assets. Morgan Mfg. Co. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 4 Cir., 1941, 124 F.2d 602; Worcester Salt Co. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 2 Cir., 1935, 75 F.2d 251. In Starr v.

It seems clear that such a situation results, in its legal effect, in a reorganization within not only the letter but the spirit of the taxing statute and brings the transaction within that class which Congress plainly intended not to tax until the stockholder finally disposed of his stock and his profit was definitely ascertainable. There was no change in the taxpayer\u2019s position with respect to the ownership of the property but merely a change in the form of the stock certificates held by him.\u201d See also f.n. 19 infra.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b856-18\"> Helvering v.

The underlying purpose of the exemptions in \u00a7 112 is to disregard corporate manipulations which do not substantially affect the shareholders\u2019 interest in the properties. Apparently the liquidation of a holding company was not thought of as such a case, and for that reason it was made taxable; but we need not wince when this hiatus is filled by what appears to be an insufficient occasion.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
