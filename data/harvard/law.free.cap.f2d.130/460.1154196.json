The receiver of the Carrier was engaged in interstate transport of merchandise by two separate methods. One was by rail and the other by motor carriers on the highways of Nevada. There is no evidence and no finding of the district court that the motor carriage of the corporation was in any way connected with its rail carriage. Obviously, the receiver\u2019s truck carriage does not become connected with his rail carriage because the word \u201cRailway\u201d appears in the title of the Carrier corporation. Neither evidence nor finding showed that the Carrier\u2019s trucks even operated in such a \u201cpickup\u201d function for and incidental to the rail carriage as was considered in Circuit Judge Groner\u2019s opinion in American Trucking Ass\u2019ns v. United States, D.C., 17 F.Supp. 655.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-22\">The receiver\u2019s description of this separate line highway interstate trucking ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>pears in the footnote.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The \u201cpick up\u201d truck there listed, serves the over the highway trucking. It was not proved or contended that it also served the railroad traffic of the receiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">The appellant, acting on behalf of the Union, presented to the receiver two proposed written contracts, one respecting terms of employment of the motor operating employees of the receiver, and the other respecting wages. There were some weeks of delay by the receiver and finally, as the court found on supporting evidence, the appellant notified the receiver that unless the contracts were accepted by him by a certain day his Union would cause a strike, a picketing and a boycott against the business conducted by the receiver. There was no evidence and no finding that any violence against any men or property was threatened. The receiver petitioned the district court and injunctions, preliminary and pendente lite, were ordered, followed by the decree appealed from.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">The district court held that so far as concerns labor disputes of the truck drivers and their Union with the receiver they are controlled bv the Railway Labor Act, 45 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 155, 44 Stat. 580.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">There is no question that the injunctive decree is valid if the Railway Labor Act controls, for none of the requirements which are conditions precedent to the right of rail carrier employees to strike were satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">The district court, In re Virginia &amp; Truckee Ry., 36 F.Supp. 119, 121, arrived at its conclusion that the Railway Labor Act is applicable in the following language:</p>\n<p id=\"b521-9\">\u201cThe \u2018Motor Carrier Act,\u2019 Title 49 U.S. C.A., Chapter 8, \u00a7 301 et seq., deals with motor carriers engaged in interstate commerce \u2018including such motor vehicle operations of carriers by rail or water, and of express or forwarding companies, except to the extent that these operations are subject to the provisions of chapter 1 of this title.\u2019 Tit. 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 303(a) (14), \u00a7 313(b). Chapter 1, so referred to, is the \u2018Interstate Commerce Act, 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1 et seq.\u2019 American Trucking Ass\u2019ns v. United States, D.C., 17 F.Supp. 655. By the provisions of this Act, the Interstate Commerce Commission has conferred upon it the powers and duties: \u2018To regulate common carriers by motor vehicle * * * qualifications and maximum hours of service of employees, and safety of operation and equipment.\u2019 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 304(a) (1). United States v. American Trucking Ass\u2019ns, 310 U.S. 534, 60 S.Ct. 1059, 84 L.Ed. 1345.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b521-10\">We are unable to follow the district court\u2019s reasoning based on this extract from section 303(a) (14) of the Motor Carrier\u2019s Act, 49 U.S.C.A. 301 et seq. The sentence from which the extracted phrase is taken is the definition of the term \u201ccommon carrier by motor vehicle,\u201d and reads as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b521-11\">\u201cThe term \u2018common carrier by motor vehicle\u2019 means any person who or which undertakes, whether directly or by a lease or any other arrangement,, to transport passengers or property, or any class or classes of property, for the general public in interstate or foreign commerce by motor vehicle for compensation, whether over <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>regular or irregular routes, including such motor vehicle operations of carriers by rail or water, and of express or forwarding companies, except to the extent that these operations are subject to the provisions of part I.\u201d 49 Stat. 544 \u00a7 203(a) (14), 49 U.S.C.A. 303(a) (14).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">None of the \u201cmotor vehicle operations of carriers by rail or water, and of express or forwarding companies\u201d \u201care subject to the provisions of part I,\u201d except the terminal pick-up service incidental to rail carriage. The Interstate Commerce Commission draws the distinction between truck line haul and pick-up trucking for a rail haul. As was stated in Judge Groner\u2019s opinion in a three judge district court decision, \u201cWe are, therefore, in full agreement with the statement of the Commission that in adding the proviso in section 203(a) (14)\u2014 except to the extent that these operations are subject to the provisions of part 1\u2014 \u2018Congress may be presumed to have legislated with knowledge of the court decisions previously mentioned, holding that pick-up and delivery service is within the meaning of \u201ctransportation\u201d as defined in section 1 (3) of the Interstate Commerce Act (49 U. S.C.A. \u00a7 1(3) ) as well as with knowledge of our own administrative findings to the effect that while railroad terminal service by motortruck was subject to regulation under the Interstate Commerce Act, the use of motortrucks by railroads in line-haul service was not subject to that act.\u2019\u201d American Trucking Ass\u2019ns v. United States, D.C., 17 F.Supp. 655, 657.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">Here, as stated above, no evidence was introduced to support the burden of proof of appellee, petitioner below, .that any of the truckmen enjoined were engaged in any service, terminal pick-up or otherwise, incidental to rail traffic. The defendants were employed by a \u201ccommon carrier by motor vehicle\u201d on the \u201chighways\u201d of Nevada.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b522-14\">They are hence governed by the Motor Carriers Act,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> though their employer is a receiver.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b522-15\">That is to say, that so far as concerns the general regulations applying to the receiver\u2019s truck drivers, he was under the control of the Interstate Commerce Commission and not of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-16\">The district court did not rely on any contention that the Norris-LaGuardia Act does not apply where employers, other than carriers under the Railway Labor Act, have brought or had their companies brought into a federal receivership and transferred the employer status to a receiver. Nor is there any contention that the Norris-LaGuardia Act would not prevent an injunction against the employees because of violence or any other of the exceptions of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-17\">However, it has been suggested elsewhere that employers can escape the provisions against enjoining peaceful striking or picketing if their enterprises can be brought within a federal receivership. We can find no case supporting such an interpretation of the Norris-LaGuardia Act. It prohibits injunctions \u201cin <em>any </em>case involving or growing out of <em>cmy </em>labor dispute.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It provides that <em>\u201cNo </em>court of the United States shall have jurisdiction to issue\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> such injunctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-18\">There is no exception of \u201cany case\u201d or \u201cany labor dispute\u201d in receivership proceedings. It applies to the injunctions of every court. Its more recently enacted particular provisions control and limit the prior general power of federal courts to issue injunctions of Section 262 of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C.A. 377.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>The Norris-LaGuardia Act was passed seven years after the Railway Labor Act, recognizing an <em>existing </em>right to strike by employees of railroad receivers,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> if its arbitral provisions have failed to produce an agreement. It was followed in 1935 by the Motor Carriers Act, also, as shown above, recognizing receiver employees as within its provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">Apart from the clear provisions of the Norris-LaGuardia Act, we see no reason why Congress should deprive the federal courts of the right of enjoining striking and picketing in industrial disputes, where the enterprise is brought before the court for its general equity protection and should allow the injunction where the enterprise already has been brought there for equitable relief with regard to the company\u2019s creditors. In the latter case it is nonetheless an industrial dispute. The receiver\u2019s truckmen are engaged in an interstate industry and the community as a whole is as much benefited by the freedom of labor to organize effectively for collective bargaining<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> for better wages or elimination of grievances in dealing with an employing receiver as any other employer. Cf. United States v. Hutcheson, 312 U.S. 219, 235, 61 S.Ct. 463, 85 L.Ed. 788.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">Certainly the history of federal injunctions does not warrant the inference that Congress regarded federal receivers to be <em>less </em>potent to resist employee bargaining pressure than are the owners of the enterprises. A receiver\u2019s employee may ask for higher wages or shorter hours and resign if he does not obtain them. There seems no reason why several of them may not agree to do so, that is to strike. Having struck it is proper to appeal for public support against claimed unfairness of the receiver, just as against unfair treatment of any employer,\u2014that is, to picket and ask the public not to patronize one who is unfair.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">The Supreme Court has held that such a labor leader as Mr. Harry Bridges may publicly claim unfair treatment by a decision of a court rendered in a labor dispute, as an exercise of his constitutional right of free speech. Bridges v. State of California, 314 U.S. 252, 278, 62 S.Ct. 190, 86 L.Ed. 192. The receiver here is no more immune from a public statement of a claimed act of unfair treatment of his employees than was the court sentencing Bridges. True, a strike may stop the running of the trucks, but this is no more an inconvenience to the public with the trucking in receivership than in private operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-9\">The judgment is reversed. The district court was deprived of jurisdiction to issue the injunction by the Norris-LaGuardia Act and is ordered to dismiss the receiver\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-10\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b520-23\"> The Transit Company had ceased its trucking carriage prior to the filing of the petition for injunction in the district court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b521-12\"> \u201cThat since September 21, 1939 the Railway Co. operated an over-the-highway service in handling freight, and in this service handled practically all classes of freight less than carload lots; that at present the operations of the over-tHe-highway service is\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b521-13\">\u201cOne truck that operates between Reno and Virginia City, leaving Reno in the morning and returning in the afternoon ;</p>\n<p id=\"b521-14\">\u201cAnother truck that operates between Reno and Carson City, leaving Reno in the morning and returning in the afternoon ;</p>\n<p id=\"b521-15\">\u201cAnother truck that leaves Gardnerville in the morning for Reno and returns in the afternoon;</p>\n<p id=\"b521-16\">\u201cA pick-up truck that takes care of pick-ups in Reno.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-17\">\u201cTogether with what are called the light trucks;</p>\n<p id=\"b521-18\">\u201cThat they also have a standby truck that is used in case of emergency for extra work.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-19\">\u201cThat in connection with the over-the-highway service of the Railway Co., they had 16 or 17 employees, there being 4 regular and 1 extra truck drivers, 4 agents, a helper, and 5 employees in the auditing force ; that these employees were all carried on the payroll of the Railway Co.; * * *.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b521-20\"> Nothing in the case of United States v. American Trucking Ass\u2019ns, supra, cited by the district court even suggest that line trucking is subject to the Railway Labor Act. The contrary inference seems logically necessary.

Such affirmance should be upon the following grounds:</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">Appellee was appointed .receiver of the above named corporations by the court below\u2014the District Court of the United States for the District of Nevada\u2014and thus became an officer of that court. Milwaukee &amp; Minnesota Railroad Co. v. Soutter, 2 Wall. 510, 519, 17 L.Ed. 900; Stuart v. Boulware, 133 U.S. 78, 81, 10 S.Ct. 242, 33 L.Ed. 568; Union Bank of Chicago v. Kansas City Bank, 136 U.S. 223, 236, 10 S.Ct. 1013, 34 L.Ed. 341; Thompson v. Phenix Ins. Co., 136 U.S. 287, 297, 10 S.Ct. 1019, 34 L.Ed. 408; Taylor v. Sternberg, 293 U.S. 470, 472, 55 S.Ct. 260, 79 L.Ed. 599. As such officer, appellee at all pertinent times had possession of the property and conducted the business of the corporations. Such possession, however, was not in a legal sense appellee\u2019s possession, but was that of the court. Thompson v. Phenix Ins. Co., supra; Taylor v. Sternberg, supra. So, too, the business which appellee conducted was, in legal effect, conducted by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-9\">That the court had jurisdiction to appoint appellee as its officer (receiver) and, by such officer, take possession of the property and conduct the business of the corporations, as it did, is conceded. Thus, when appellants demanded that appellee sign proposed agreements (Exhibits A and B)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and threatened that, unless he did so, they would cause the business to be boycotted and would cause the property and places where the business was conducted to be picketed,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> they, in effect, threatened to interfere with the court in the exercise of its jurisdiction. To prevent such interference, the court was empowered to issue any appropriate writ (Judicial Code \u00a7 262, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 377),<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> including, of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>course, the writ of injunction.

Grayburg Oil Co., 5 Cir., 89 F.2d 536, 538.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">Section 262 of the Judicial Code has not been repealed, in whole or in part. The power thereby conferred to issue an injunction when necessary for the exercise of the court\u2019s jurisdiction is not impaired, diminished or in any wise affected by \u00a7 7 of the Norris-LaGuardia Act, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 107,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> or by any other enactment.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">The argument that \u00a7 7 of the Norris-LaGuardia Act prohibits the issuance of an injunction in a case involving or growing out of a labor dispute, even when such injunction is necessary for the exercise of the court\u2019s jurisdiction, is similar to the argument\u2014often made and as often rejected\u2014 that \u00a7 265 of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 379,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> prohibits the issuance of an injunction to stay proceedings in a State court, even when such injunction is necessary for the exercise of the jurisdiction of a Federal court. Cases rejecting the last mentioned argument are cited in the margin.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> These cases persuade me that appellants\u2019 argument respecting the Norris-LaGuardia Act should also be rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">Rehearing denied.
