The original bill was clearly demurrable. It contains no statement of the number of shares of stock authorized or outstanding, or of the nature of the business, and gives the court no information on which it could properly act; and neither the certificate of incorporation nor a copy thereof is filed as an exhibit, nor the certificate of stock alleged to be owned by plaintiff or a copy thereof. \u25a0' Ho fraud or mismanagement is alleged, nor any <em>ultra, vires </em>act. So far as appears from the bill, to enjoin the salo of assets might stop the very business for which the corporation was formed. Ho facts are alleged which entitle plaintiff to an accounting. The bill does not allege that plaintiff has been denied access to the books, or that he has demanded and been refused a statement of the affairs of the company. The only thing alleged in the bill which might indicate a ground of equitable relief is that the president of this company had informed plaintiff that he would not be permitted to share in the assets of the corporation upon the dissolution thereof, and as to this he does not ask injunctive relief, which as to that would bo the only relief that this court could give. Besides there is manifestly as to that not a full and frank statement. He should have alleged either the reason given by the president for the threatened exclusion of plaintiff from participation in the distribution of assets, or alleged that no reason was given for the proposed exclusion. Obviously there was some controversy in regard to the ownership of the stock alleged to be held by plaintiff, otherwise the threat was wholly wanton, and this the court should not assume in the absence of some allegation to that effect. The allegation that plaintiff has received no dividends on his stock is immaterial in the absence of an allegation that dividends have been paid to other stockholders, or have been wrongfully withheld. But appellant complains of the part of the decree in which leave to file an amended bill is restricted by the exclusion of the right to ask for an injunction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>against the sale of defendant\u2019s assets, as claimed in the original bill of complaint, as to which \u201cright to an injunction in the said bill of complaint, the demurrer is sustained without leave to amend unless and until the plaintiff shall file in these proceedings within five days from the date hereof a good and sufficient bond,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">We do not approve of the requirement of the filing of a bond as a condition to the permission to ask for an injunction. But there is nothing in the record to cause ns to hold that it would have been an abuse of discretion if the exclusion of the right to ask for an injunction against the sale of assets in an amended bill had been absolute. Therefore there is no reversible eror in the requirement of a bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">We are also asked to review the ruling of the chancellor refusing leave to file the amended bill that was tendered. The proposed bill has most of the serious defects of the original bill, in that there are no exhibits, there is no charge of fraud or mismanagement or <em>ultra, vires </em>acts, or any frank statement in regard to the alleged threat of Schoenlein to exclude plaintiff from his share of the assets of the corporation; and there is no injunctive relief asked to prevent such exclusion. The relief sought included an injunction against the sale of assets, which the chancellor had stated he would not permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">While the allegations of refusal to give plaintiff access to the books of the corporation, and of Schoenlein\u2019s threat to exclude plaintiff from sharing in the distribution of assets (if there had been a frank statement as to the alleged grounds of such proposed exclusion), might have prevented the bill from being demurrable if it had been an original bill, the court was dealing with a different proposition when it was asked to permit the bill to be filed as an amended bill with all its imperfections; and if we felt at liberty to pass on that question we should be inclined to sustain the action of the chancellor.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">But the granting or refusing to permit an amendment is within the discretion of the trial court, and its action in this regard will not be reviewed unless there is shown to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>been an abuse of discretion. <em>Mead v. Tydings, </em>133 Md. 608; <em>State, use of Lease, v. Bealmear, </em>149 Md. 10, 15; <em>Holloway v. Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co., </em>152 Md. 289, 300; <em>Schmidt v. Johnson, </em>154 Md. 125; <em>Frisch v. Baltimore, </em>156 Md. 310. We find no abuse of discretion in this case. But the appellant should not be deprived of his right of access to the books of the company or of protection against a wrongful exclusion from participation in the assets of the corporation, if, in fact, he is a stockholder.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">The affirmance of the decree and order appealed from will therefore be without prejudice to his right to ask leave to file a proper amended bill in this ease or to file a new original bill of complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">\n<em>Decree and order affirmed, and case remanded, without prejudice, with costs to appellee.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
