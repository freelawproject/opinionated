On appeal, Mrs. and Mrs. Edwards pose the following question for review, which we have rephrased slightly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-9\">Did the circuit court err in ruling that the limited exemption from liability granted to lenders under Md.Code (1997 Cum. Supp.), \u00a7 4 \u2014 401(i)(2)(i)(2) of the Environment Article (\u201cEnv.\u201d) abrogates Maryland\u2019s common law causes of action for negligence, nuisance, trespass, and strict liability against a lender?<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b125-10\">We answer the question presented \u201cyes.\u201d Accordingly, we reverse the judgment in favor of First National Bank of North East and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">Randy and Cynthia Edwards are the owners of residential real property in North East, Maryland known as 505 Mechanics Valley Road. Their property is adjacent to and downgrade from commercial property known as 513 Mechanics Valley Road. For approximately twenty years, the 513 Mechanics Valley Road site was used for a gasoline service station. During part of that time, from 1981 until 1994, the property was owned by Jacqueline C. Yerkes. Mrs. Yerkes and her husband added a mini-market to the gasoline service station. The property came to be called the \u201cT &amp; C Mini Market.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">First National Bank of North East (\u201cthe Bank\u201d) held a mortgage on the T &amp; C Mini Market property. When Mrs. Yerkes defaulted on the mortgage, the Bank foreclosed on the property. Thereafter, on May 10, 1994, it purchased the property at the foreclosure sale and took possession of it. A few weeks later, the Bank conducted \u201ctank tightness tests\u201d on two 6,016 gallon underground storage tanks (\u201cUSTs\u201d) and one 3,000 gallon UST on the property. The tanks passed all of the tests and were judged to be tight.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">The Bank then contracted with Edwards Service Station Equipment, Inc. (\u201cESSE\u201d) to remove the USTs. ESSE did so on October 24, 1994, under the watchful eyes of Maryland Department of the Environment (\u201cMDE\u201d) employees. Removal of the USTs produced a strong smell of petroleum. Tests that were later performed on the property by MDE revealed the presence of petroleum byproducts in the soil at levels greater than permitted by law. MDE arranged for three testing wells to be installed on the T &amp; C Mini Market property and ordered further testing to be undertaken. Those tests showed the continued presence of petroleum byproducts in the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">In the meantime, on May 5, 1994, shortly before the Bank took possession of the T &amp; C Mini Market property, Mr. and Mrs. Edwards installed a new deep well on their property. They did so in part because Mrs. Edwards was operating a day care center in their home and she needed to comply with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>certain local health regulations. The new well was approved by the Cecil County Health Department on September 9, 1994, after officials \u201ccompleted multiple tests and personal inspections.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">In late November, 1994, Mr. and Mrs. Edwards noticed the smell of gasoline in their house. When the smell intensified, they had their well-water tested. Tests performed on January 28, 1995 came up positive for PH-petroleum hydrocarbons. The MDE performed additional tests that confirmed the presence of petroleum byproducts in the Edwards\u2019s well.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">On August 20, 1996, Mr. and Mrs. Edwards filed suit for damages against the Bank and against ESSE for injury to their real and personal property, in the Circuit Court for Cecil County. They pleaded causes of action against both defendants for violation of Env. \u00a7 4-409, negligence, nuisance, trespass, and strict liability. On December 20, 1996, the Bank filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim for which relief could be granted, pursuant to Md. Rule 2-322. Mr. and Mrs. Edwards opposed the motion, and the matter was set in for a hearing before the trial court on April 9,1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">In its memorandum of law in support of its motion to dismiss and at the hearing before the trial court, the Bank argued that it was exempt from liability under Env. \u00a7 4-409(a) by the protections conferred by Env. \u00a7 4 \u2014 401(i)(2)(i)(2) and, moreover, that the common law causes of action against it were preempted by Env. \u00a7 4 \u2014 401 (i)(2)(i)(2). After hearing argument of counsel, the trial court granted the Bank\u2019s motion, from the bench. It subsequently issued a written order dismissing the Bank from the case and entering final judgment against Mr. and Mrs. Edwards in favor of the Bank upon a finding that \u201cthere is no just reason for delay,\u201d under Md. Rule 2 \u2014 602(b).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Mr. and Mrs. Edwards then noted this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>STANDARD OF REVIEW<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">On review of a judgment granting a motion to dismiss under Md. Rule 2-322, we must assume as true all well-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>pleaded facts in the complaint and all reasonable inferences that may be drawn from them. <em>Stone v. Chicago Title Ins. Co. of Md., </em>330 Md. 329, 333, 624 A.2d 496 (1993). We then decide whether the well-pleaded allegations of fact in the complaint reveal any set of facts that would entitle the plaintiff to relief. If so, the motion to dismiss was improperly granted. <em>Shah v. HealthPlus, </em>116 Md.App. 327, 331-32, 696 A.2d 473, <em>cert. denied, </em>347 Md. 682, 702 A.2d 291 (1997); <em>Morris v. Osmose Wood Preserving, </em>99 Md.App. 646, 652-53, 639 A.2d 147 (1994), <em>aff'd in part, rev\u2019d in part, </em>340 Md. 519, 667 A.2d 624 (1995); <em>Tafflin v. Levitt, </em>92 Md.App. 375, 379, 608 A.2d 817 (citing <em>Flaherty v. Weinberg, </em>303 Md. 116. 135-36, 492 A.2d 618 (1985)), <em>cert. denied, </em>328 Md. 447, 614 A.2d 974 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">Soon after Mr. and Mrs. Edwards noted their appeal in the case <em>sub judice, </em>the Court of Appeals filed its opinion in <em>JBG/Twinbrook Metro Ltd. v. Wheeler, </em>346 Md. 601, 697 A.2d 898 (1997). In that case, the Court addressed, <em>inter alia, </em>the scope of the private remedy established by Env. \u00a7 4-409(a). That section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-6\">The person responsible for the oil spillage shall be liable to any other person for any damage to his real or personal property directly caused by the spillage.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">In <em>JBG/Twinbrook, </em>a property owner sued his neighbor for damages caused by percolation of gasoline into the plaintiffs land from the neighbor\u2019s adjacent gasoline station. The Court examined the legislative history of the Water Pollution Control and Abatement Act, Md.Code \u00a7\u00a7 4-401 through 4-420 of the Environment Article (the \u201cAct\u201d), and Env. \u00a7 4-409 in particular, and held that the private cause of action created by \u00a7 4-409(a) did not apply to the case. Specifically, it found that \u201cthe \u2018oil spillage\u2019 referred to in [that section] is a spillage or discharge from a vessel, ship, or boat,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>at 613, 697 A.2d 898, and \u201cdoes not apply to a discharge from an UST ...\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 618, 697 A.2d 898.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>In light of the Court\u2019s decision in <em>JBG/Twinbrook, </em>Mr. and Mrs. Edwards concede, as they must, that the private remedy created by Env. \u00a7 4-409(a) is not available to them and that the lower court correctly dismissed their claim under that statute, albeit for a different reason. They do not contest the dismissal of that claim. They maintain, however, that the circuit court erred in ruling that the Water Pollution Control and Abatement Act in its entirety, and Env. \u00a7 4 \u2014 401 (i) (2)(i) (2) specifically, abrogated their common law causes of action for negligence, nuisance, trespass, and strict liability in tort.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">Env. \u00a7 4-401 sets forth definitions for certain terms that are used in the Act. \u201cPerson responsible for the discharge,\u201d one such term, is defined at Env. \u00a7 4-401(i)(l) to include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-5\">(i) The owner of the discharged oil<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-6\">(ii) The owner, operator, or person in charge of the oil storage facility, vessel, barge, or vehicle involved in the discharge at the time of or immediately before the discharge; and ,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-7\">(iii) Any other person who through act or omission causes the discharge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b130-8\">The statutory language at issue in this case appears in Env. \u00a7 4-401(i)(2), which defines those who do <em>not </em>fall into the category of \u201cPerson responsible for the discharge:\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-9\">(i) A person who, without participating in the management of an underground oil storage tank, and who otherwise is not engaged in petroleum production, refining, or marketing, holds indicia of ownership in an underground oil storage tank primarily to protect its security interest in that underground oil storage tank if that person [ ... ]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-10\">2. Abandoned that underground oil storage tank under regulations of the Department within 180 days of acquiring the tank through foreclosure or other means.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>The Bank contends that, on the facts alleged in the complaint and within the meaning of Env. \u00a7 4 \u2014 401 (i)(2)(i)(2), it \u201cabandoned\u201d the USTs at the T <em>&amp; </em>C Mini Market site within 180 days of acquiring the property through foreclosure and thus it is not a \u201cPerson responsible for the discharge\u201d under the Act. It argues further that because the legislative intent behind Env. \u00a7 4 \u2014 401 (i)(2)(i)(2) is, to use its words, \u201cto protect a foreclosing lender from liability if the lender removes an underground storage tank within 180 days following foreclosure,\u201d the trial court properly ruled that the Act abrogated all common law causes of action against it arising out of contamination of adjacent property by oil kept in the USTs on the T &amp; C Mini Market property. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>In determining the legislative intent of a statute, \u201c \u2018[t]he primary source ... is, of course, the language of the statute itself.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Pagano, </em>341 Md. 129, 133, 669 A.2d 1339 (1996)(citing <em>Tucker v. Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co., </em>308 Md. 69, 73, 517 A.2d 730 (1986)); <em>Claggett v. State, </em>108 Md.App. 32, 40, 670 A.2d 1002, <em>cert. denied, </em>342 Md. 330, 675 A.2d 992 (1996). \u201cIn some circumstances, [the courts] need not look beyond the statutory language to determine the legislative purpose. \u2018Sometimes the language in question will be so clearly consistent with apparent purpose (and not productive of any absurd result) that further research will be unnecessary.\u2019 \u201d <em>Pagano, </em>341 Md. at 133, 669 A.2d 1339 (quoting <em>Kaczorowski v. City of Baltimore, </em>309 Md. 505, 515, 525 A.2d 628 (1987)).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">The Bank urges us to construe Env. \u00a7 4-401(i)(2)(i)(2) broadly, as a general grant of immunity from suit in favor of commercial lenders. Yet, the statutory language states only that, under certain limited and defined circumstances, a lender is not a \u201cPerson responsible for the discharge.\u201d To the extent that a lender could face exposure to liability as a \u201cPerson responsible for the discharge,\u201d within the meaning of the Act, its exclusion from that category under Env. \u00a7 4-401 (i)(2)(i)(2) would insulate it. To interpret Env. \u00a7 4 \u2014 401(i)(2)(i)(2) to confer blanket immunity for lenders against common law liability for groundwater contamination, we would have to disregard the narrowly circumscribed language of the statute and illogically generalize its meaning. In interpreting the language of a statute, we must apply common sense and avoid unreasonable constructions. <em>Armstead v. State, </em>342 Md. 38, 56, 673 A.2d 221 (1996). We decline to find in the limited and specific exclusion spelled out in Env. \u00a7 4-401(i)(2)(i)(2) the overarching and sweeping meaning that the Bank suggests.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">In addition, Env. \u00a7 4-401 (i)(2)(i)(2) must be read in conjunction with the remainder of the Act, <em>see County Commissioners v. Bell Atlantic, </em>346 Md. 160, 178, 695 A.2d 171 (1997), which includes a purpose clause expressly prohibiting any construe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>tion of the Act so as to abrogate or preempt common law remedies. Env. \u00a7 4-403, entitled \u201cConstruction and purpose of subtitle; remedies additional and cumulative,\u201d is explicit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aiv\">... It is the purpose of this subtitle to provide additional and cumulative remedies to prevent, abate, and control the pollution of the waters of the State. This subtitle may not be construed to abridge or alter rights of action or remedies in equity under existing common law, statutory law, criminal or civil, nor may any provision of this subtitle, or any act done pursuant to it, be construed as estopping any person, as riparian owner or otherwise, in the exercise of his rights in equity, under the common law, or statutory law to suppress nuisances or abate pollution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-4\">The meaning of Env. \u00a7 4-403 is plainly apparent from its language. The words of the statute reflect the General Assembly\u2019s intention that the Act, which comprises subtitle 4 of the Environment Article, <em>not </em>be read to affect common law remedies. We need not search further for statutory meaning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-5\">When the language of a statute is plain and unambiguous, there is usually no need for a court to inquire further [to ascertain the legislative intent]. <em>Board of Trustees of Md. State Retirement &amp; Pension Sys. v. Hughes, </em>340 Md. 1, 7-8, 664 A.2d 1250, 1253 (1995). If the language of the statute is clear and expresses the intention of the legislature, it must be construed to give effect to that intention regardless of the consequences, even though such effect may cause a hardship. <em>Schmeizl v. Schmeizl, </em>186 Md. 371, 375, 46 A.2d 619, 621 (1946). Simply put, a court construing an unambiguous statute must view the law as it is, and not as it might wish it to be. <em>Department of Economic Dev. v. Taylor, </em>108 Md.App. 250, 277, 671 A.2d 523, 537, <em>cert. granted, </em>343 Md. 332, 681 A.2d 68 (1996). <em>See In re Adoption/Guardianship No. A91-71A, </em>334 Md. 538, 557, 640 A.2d 1085, 1095 (1994).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-6\"><em>Brzowski v. Md. Home Improvement, </em>114 Md.App. 615, 627, 691 A.2d 699, <em>cert. denied, </em>346 Md. 238, 695 A.2d 1227 (1997). Moreover,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>Maryland courts adhere to the policy that statutes are not to be construed to alter the common-law by implication. The reason for this protection of common-law principles from statutory erosion is based on Article 5 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, which guarantees to Maryland citizens the common-law of England. Thus, there is a presumption against statutory preemption of the common-law. The presumption is easily dissipated if the statute expressly overrides a common-law principle.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b134-5\"><em>Hardy v. State, </em>301 Md. 124, 131-32, 482 A.2d 474 (1984) (citations omitted). <em>See also Richwind v. Brunson, </em>335 Md. 661, 672, 645 A.2d 1147 (1994) (recognizing \u201cwell-settled principle in Maryland that, in construing a statute, [appellate courts] assume that the statute was not intended to modify, nullify, or supersede the common law of the State absent any clear indication to the contrary.\u201d); <em>Lutz v. State, </em>167 Md. 12, 15, 172 A. 354 (1934). In this case, not only does the statute in question not expressly override the common law, it expressly states that it shall not be interpreted to override the common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">Without making mention of Env. \u00a7 4-403 in its brief, the Bank argues that Env. \u00a7 4-401(i)(2)(i)(2) must be interpreted broadly so as to protect lenders against common law liability for two reasons: first, any other interpretation of the subsection would render it superfluous, especially in light of the Court\u2019s holding in <em>JBG/Twinbrook; </em>and second, the legislative history surrounding the passage of the section evidences an intention on the part of the General Assembly to extend a broad grant of immunity to commercial lenders.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">We agree that statutes should not be read so as to render their language superfluous. <em>See Bell Atlantic, </em>346 Md. at 178, 695 A.2d 171; <em>City of Baltimore v. Hockley, </em>300 Md. 277, 283, 477 A.2d 1174 (1984). We also agree that, under <em>JBG/Twinbrook, </em>the protection afforded by Env. \u00a7 4-401(i)(2)(i)(2) cannot insulate lenders from liability under the private remedy created by Env. \u00a7 4-409(a) in cases involving contamination by USTs because, as the Court of Appeals made plain, \u00a7 4-409(a) does not apply to situations of that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>sort, in any event. We disagree, however, that to give meaning to Env. \u00a7 4 \u2014 401(i)(2)(i)(2), we must read it to abrogate common law causes of action against lenders, in direct contravention of the statutory purpose stated in Env. \u00a7 4-403. If the term \u201cPerson responsible for discharge\u201d were used only in Env. \u00a7 4-409(a), there might be some logical foundation to the Bank\u2019s argument. In fact, its use is not so confined. The term is found in several subsections of the Act including, most notably, Env. \u00a7 4-405, which empowers the MDE to bring suit for remediation and clean up costs:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-4\">... Any person who is determined to be responsible for the discharge or spillage of [oil, which is defined to include petroleum and petroleum by-products] shall be personally and/or severally responsible to immediately clean up and abate the effects of the spillage and restore the natural resources of the State. The Department shall assume control of any discharge or spill situation when it determines that the person responsible for the discharge is not acting promptly in a manner appropriate to remove, mitigate, control, or rectify the spill. If the Department believes instituting suit is advisable, it shall turn over to the Attorney General all pertinent information and data. The Attorney General shall then file suit against the person causing the condition. The person shall be jointly and severally liable for the reasonable cost of rehabilitation and restoration of the resources damaged and the cost of eliminating the condition causing the damage, including the environmental monetary value of such resources as established by regulation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">Env. \u00a7 4-405(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">The legislative history that the Bank cites and the policy observations that it makes are not persuasive. To be sure, the 1992 enactment of what is now Env. \u00a7 4 \u2014 401(i)(2)(i)(2) and the 1997 amendments to that section evidence legislative concern that commercial lenders not be disinclined to extend mortgages for fear of incurring legal responsibility and liability under the Act when they must take possession of mortgaged property to protect a security interest. Indeed, Env. \u00a7 4-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>401(i)(2)(i)(2) addresses those concerns by protecting lenders from remediation and clean up suits brought by the MDE when certain conditions are satisfied. The legislative history does not evidence an express or even an implied intention on the part of the General Assembly to abrogate, abolish, or preempt common law remedies against commercial lenders, however.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">Finally, the Bank argues that we should affirm the circuit court\u2019s dismissal of the nuisance, trespass, negligence, and strict liability in tort claims against it because the facts alleged in the complaint do not support those causes of action. This argument was not raised in or decided by the circuit court. Accordingly, it is not properly before us for review. Md. Rule 8 \u2014 131(a); <em>Moats v.

The Bank\u2019s motion to dismiss was filed before the February 27, 1997 amendments, as was the Edwards\u2019s opposition memorandum. The parties and the trial court were all aware of the amendments to Env. \u00a7 4 \u2014 401 (i) by the time of the hearing in circuit court, however.

Even when the trial court has fulfilled the written certification requirement of Md.

Yorkridge Service Corp., </em>292 Md. 557, 569, 440 A.2d 373 (1982)(quoting <em>Diener Enterprises, Inc. v. Miller, 266 </em>Md. 551, 556, 295 A.2d 470 (1972)).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the record does not memorialize the thought process employed by the trial judge in deciding to certify the judgment as final. Our authority under Md. Rule 8-602(e)(l) to enter a final judgment if we determine that a lower court had discretion to do so under Md. Rule 2-602(b), but failed to do so, implicitly empowers us to decide <em>ab initio </em>whether the certification of a final judgment in a given case is permissible, as a matter of policy. We find \u00bfbat it is in this case. The claims against the Bank that appellants seek to resurrect, if resurrected, are not such as may be rendered moot. <em>Compare, Huber v. Nationwide Ins. Co., </em>347 Md. 415, 701 A.2d 415 (1997). More important, the common law claims against ESSE will almost certainly be affected by the lower court\u2019s ruling on preemption, as ESSE is alleged to have been acting as an agent of the Bank; until that issue is resolved on appeal, the scope of ESSE\u2019s potential liability cannot be known, and full resolution of the claims against it is not possible. This exigency outweighs the drawbacks attendant to a piecemeal appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b128-8\">. The Bank attached two exhibits to its motion to dismiss: an affidavit of J. David McDaniel, its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and a letter by Herbert M. Meade, Chief of MDE\u2019s Compliance/Remediation Division of the Oil Control Program. In Mr. McDaniel\u2019s affidavit, he attests that ESSE was an \"independent contractor.\u201d This fact, which is contested by Mr. and Mrs. Edwards, had no bearing on the court's ruling on the motion to dismiss. In his letter, Mr. Meade states that, under the MDE\u2019s interpretation of Env. \u00a7 4-401, the Bank is not a \"Person responsible for the discharge.\u201d It does not appear that Mr. and Mrs. Edwards took issue with that statement, at least within the context of the preemption issue raised by the Bank in its motion. Moreover, the statement is relevant only to the statutory claim which, as we shall explain, the parties agree was properly dismissed. It, too, had no bearing on the trial court\u2019s ruling with respect to the common law counts. For these reasons, it is apparent that the court did not treat the Bank\u2019s motion to dismiss as a motion for summary judgment under Md. Rule 2~322(c), even though it was filed with attachments that addressed facts outside of the complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b130-11\">. \"Oil\u201d is defined to include, <em>inter alia, </em>petroleum, petroleum byproducts, and gasoline.
