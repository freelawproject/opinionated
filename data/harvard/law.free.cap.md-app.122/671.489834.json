Pryor,appellant, was convicted of possession with intent to distribute crack cocaine in excess of fifty grams. The State\u2019s evidence was sufficient to establish his guilt of that offense. This appeal calls into question the means by which that evidence was acquired, and requires that we examine an important rule of engagement applicable to the forcible stop of a motorist who commits a minor traffic violation while under police surveillance: the point in time at which continued detention violates the motorist\u2019s Fourth Amendment protection against unreasonable searches and seizures. We hold that, unless continued detention can be justified by what occurs during the brief period of time it takes to determine whether the motorist has a valid license and whether the vehicle has been reported stolen, a motorist who is subjected to a <em>\u201cWhren</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>stop\u201d for a minor traffic violation cannot be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>detained at the scene of the stop longer than it takes \u2014 or reasonably should take \u2014 to issue a citation for the traffic violation that the motorist committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">Sometime in August of 1995, Detective Scott Griffin of the Baltimore County Police Department was told by a confidential informant that appellant was \u201cselling a large quantity of cocaine in the Frederick Road area of Catonsville.\u201d The informant provided Detective Griffin with appellant\u2019s address as well as the make and model of appellant\u2019s automobile, and also said that appellant stored his cocaine in a secret compartment within the dash of that automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">Detective Griffin verified that appellant was the registered owner of the vehicle described by the informant, and that appellant leased an apartment in the building identified by the informant. On October 31, 1995, Detective Griffin observed appellant and two other individuals exit appellant\u2019s apartment building, enter appellant\u2019s vehicle, and leave the area. Detective Griffin pursued in an unmarked vehicle and when he observed appellant driving at the speed of forty miles-per-hour in a posted, twenty-five mile-per-hour zone, he had appellant\u2019s vehicle stopped by a uniformed officer in a marked police vehicle. Appellant and his passengers were ordered out of the vehicle and were forced to wait at the scene while a K-9 \u201cdrug dog\u201d was summoned. When the dog arrived, it conducted a \u201cperimeter search\u201d of the vehicle and indicated the presence of a controlled dangerous substance within the vehicle. The dog then entered the vehicle and indicated that the substance was somewhere within the dash. A search of that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>area turned up a hidden compartment in which crack cocaine had been secreted.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">Appellant filed a timely motion for suppression of evidence. At the suppression hearing, the State, appellant\u2019s counsel, and the court agreed that this case was controlled by <em>Munafo v. State, </em>105 Md.App. 662, 660 A.2d 1068 (1995). The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-6\">This case is very similar to <em>[Munafo v. State </em>] ... There is no question in the Court\u2019s mind that [appellant] was stopped for speeding. Whether or not that was subterfuge, makes no difference. However, when they stopped him for speeding, they had an obligation and a duty to issue him a speeding ticket and send him on his way as was the case in <em>[Munafo </em>]. The question is whether the continued detention ... was based on reasonable articulable suspicion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-7\">The Court finds that although [the informant\u2019s tip coupled with Detective Griffin\u2019s independent verification] is somewhat thin ... the Court feels it was sufficient at this time to give a reasonable person articulable suspicion that there was a crime being committed at that point.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b702-8\">The motion for suppression was denied and appellant was convicted. When this case was originally before us during our 1997 term, appellant presented the following questions for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-9\">I. Did the trial court err in declining to suppress the fruits of the search of [a]ppellant\u2019s car as the products of an unreasonable search?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>II. Did the trial court err in admitting [a]ppellant\u2019s statement because it was not proven to be voluntary?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">We answered no to appellant\u2019s second question,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> but concluded that a remand was necessary to determine the period of time between the moment of appellant\u2019s initial stop and the moment when the incriminating evidence was seized,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and gave the following directions to the circuit court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-6\">If the search of appellant\u2019s automobile violated his constitutional rights, he is entitled to a judgment of acquittal notwithstanding the fact that his post-arrest statement was voluntary. The statement, as well as items seized from appellant\u2019s apartment, constituted derivative evidence of the automobile search. If, on remand, the circuit court concludes that the automobile search was valid, appellant is not entitled to any relief because the jurors received evidence of his post-arrest statement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">On remand, the circuit court proceeded to resolve the issue of \u201chow long the appellant was detained for K-9 to arrive,\u201d and announced the following findings and conclusions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-8\">The Court finds it was in the area of twenty, maximum of twenty-five, minutes that it took the K-9 officer to get there. That he, in fact, then let the dog sniff the car and a hit was alerted on the car.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-9\">The Court further finds that certainly under the circumstances herein, the arresting officer who had the probable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>cause called immediately upon the stop of the car, which incidentally was speeding doing over forty miles an hour in a twenty-five mile an hour zone, and promptly called the K-9 unit. The K-9 officer testified that he was the only one available and that he promptly responded.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-4\">The Court finds that the stop and the amount of time was more than reasonable in this case given all of the facts that have been testified to in open court. I reject the fact that it was ... it was forty-five minutes or more (as claimed) by the Defendant. I find that both officers\u2019 testimony to be credible with regard to the time frame and as such the motion, again, will be denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">This second appeal followed, in which appellant now presents a single question for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-6\">Did the suppression court err in finding that the 20 to 25-minute roadside detention of Appellant while awaiting [sic] for a drug sniffing dog was reasonable under all the circumstances?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">We accept the circuit court\u2019s non-clearly erroneous finding of fact that appellant and his passengers were detained \u201cin the area of\u2019 twenty minutes, and no longer than twenty-five minutes before the K-9 arrived. We are persuaded, however, that the question now before us should be answered \u201cyes.\u201d Appellant was detained for an unreasonable period of time pending the arrival of the K-9. That unreasonable detention violated his Fourth Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-9\">The Fourth Amendment permits the warrantless search of an automobile when there is probable cause to believe that the automobile contains contraband or evidence of criminal activity. <em>Carroll v. United States, </em>267 U.S. 132, 149, 45 S.Ct 280, 283, 69 L.Ed. 543 (1925); <em>Malcolm v. State, </em>314 Md. 221, 226-227, 550 A.2d 670(1988). A search based on probable cause \u201cobviously may continue until the probable cause has dissipated or developed into confirmed facts indicating criminal activity.\u201d <em>Graham v. State, </em>119 Md.App. 444, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>459, 705 A.2d 82 (1998). In this case, however, the officers did not have probable cause to conduct a warrantless search of appellant\u2019s vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\">The Fourth Amendment permits the forcible stop of an automobile, the frisk of its occupants, and the inspection of items within their reach, when there is (1) a reasonable articulable suspicion that the occupants are involved in criminal activity, and (2) a reasonable articulable suspicion that one or more of the occupants is armed with a weapon. <em>Derricott v. State, </em>327 Md. 582, 587, 611 A.2d 592 (1992). In <em>Williams v. State, </em>19 Md.App. 204, 310 A.2d 593 (1973), when this Court held that the rationale of <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968) applies to occupants of automobiles, Judge Moylan \u201cnoted that an occupant of an automobile is just as subject to a reasonable \u2018stop\u2019 and to a reasonable \u2018frisk\u2019 as is a pedestrian.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 210, 88 S.Ct. 1868. In this case, however, there was no reasonable articulable suspicion to believe that a stop of appellant\u2019s vehicle, and/or a frisk of its occupants, was necessary for the officers\u2019 safety. \u201cWhile there undoubtedly is some risk to the police in every confrontation, <em>Terry </em>has never been thought to authorize a protective frisk on the occasion of every authorized stop.\u201d <em>Simpler v. State, </em>318 Md. 311, 321, 568 A.2d 22 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">It is well settled, however, that the forcible stop of a motorist may be based on reasonable articulable suspicion that is insufficient to establish probable cause.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Goode v. State, </em>41 Md.App. 623, 629-630, 398 A.2d 801 (1979). Under <em>Whren, </em>the law enforcement officer who observes a traffic violation may stop the violator, even though the officer does so out of curiosity as to whether (or in the hope that) the stop will lead to the discovery of other incriminating evidence. <em>Whren, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>supra, 517 U.S. 806, 116 S.Ct. at 1774; <em>Whitehead v. State, </em>116 Md.App. 497, 500-501, 698 A.2d 1115 (1997). The forcible stop of appellant\u2019s vehicle was justified for two reasons: (1) there was reasonable articulable suspicion that appellant might be in possession of contraband; and (2) an officer saw appellant violate the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">The right to make a forcible stop does not justify a subsequent unreasonable detention. In <em>United States v. Place, </em>462 U.S. 696, 103 S.Ct. 2637, 77 L.Ed.2d 110 (1983), the Supreme Court noted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-7\">the brevity of the invasion of the individual\u2019s Fourth Amendment interests is an important factor in determining whether the seizure is so minimally intrusive as to be justifiable on reasonable suspicion. Moreover, in assessing the effect of the length of the detention, we take into account whether the police diligently pursue their investigation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b706-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 709, 103 S.Ct. 2637.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-9\">In <em>Snow v. State, </em>84 Md.App. 243, 578 A.2d 816 (1990), in <em>Munafo v. State, </em>105 Md.App. 662, 660 A.2d 1068 (1995), and in <em>Whitehead, </em>supra, this Court reversed violations of the Maryland Controlled Dangerous Substances Act that were based on evidence turned up during searches of automobiles that had been lawfully stopped by officers who witnessed the driver violate a traffic law. In <em>Munafo, </em>the motorist stopped for a traffic violation was detained thereafter on the officer\u2019s \u201chunch\u201d that there were drugs in the vehicle. <em>Id. </em>at 666-67, 660 A.2d 1068. We concluded that the officer had actually made two separate stops: (1) the traffic stop, and (2) a \u201csecond\u201d stop that took place immediately after the first. <em>Id. </em>at 673, 660 A.2d 1068. We ultimately held that the \u201csecond\u201d stop was not based on reasonable articulable suspicion, and that the evidence seized in the resulting search should have been suppressed. <em>Id. </em>at 676, 660 A.2d 1068.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-10\">Like <em>Snow, Munafo, </em>and <em>Whitehead, </em>appellant was lawfully stopped for a traffic violation, and then detained further. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>this case, however, the \u201csecond\u201d stop (or continued detention) was not based on anything that occurred after appellant had been stopped for speeding. Unlike the cases in which a motorist is stopped on a mere \u201chunch\u201d that illegal activity will be discovered, Detective Griffin\u2019s independent verification of the detailed information supplied by his confidential informant was more than sufficient to establish the reasonable articulable suspicion required for a forcible stop of appellant\u2019s vehicle. Here, the police team was entitled to stop appellant\u2019s vehicle before appellant committed the traffic violation that provided an independent justification for the stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">The Fourth Amendment does not protect the motorist against the seizure of any incriminating evidence observed in \u201copen view.\u201d <em>Brown v. State, </em>15 Md.App. 584, 606-607, 292 A.2d 762 (1972). A police officer who has made a lawful stop of an automobile has every right to look \u201cthrough the window into the interior of the car (with or without a) flashlight ... (just as) every member of the public (has) a right to do,\u201d and to thereafter search the automobile if the look through the window establishes probable cause for such action. <em>Scales v. State, </em>18 Md.App. 474, 478-479, 284 A.2d 45 (1971). In this case, Detective Griffin and his fellow investigating officers had every right to be at the elbow of the uniformed officer who stopped appellant\u2019s vehicle, to \u201caccost\u201d appellant and the occupants of his vehicle, and to ask appellant for consent to search the vehicle.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It is obvious, however, that their exercise of the right to accost appellant and to look through the window into the interior of his vehicle could be accomplished in a much shorter period of time than it would take to issue a traffic citation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In any event, no incriminating evidence was observed in open view.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>Although the stop of appellant\u2019s vehicle was justified under two different theories, neither of those theories justified a detention that extended beyond the period of time that it would reasonably have taken for a uniformed officer to go through the procedure involved in issuing a citation to a motorist. The police did not have a right to subject appellant to the functional equivalent of two successive periods of detention. The reasonable articulable suspicion that preceded the <em>Whren </em>stop in this case did not extend the limited period of detention that is permissible under <em>Whren.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\"> The Fourth Amendment permits the forcible stop of a motorist who is observed by a law enforcement officer to be violating a \u201crule of the road.\u201d The Fourth Amendment also permits the forcible stop of a vehicle when there is reasonable articulable suspicion to believe that its occupants are involved in criminal activity. In neither of these situations, however, may the occupants of the vehicle be detained for an extended period of time. In the absence of a justification for continued detention that manifests itself during the period of time reasonably necessary for the officer to (1) investigate the driver\u2019s sobriety and license status, (2) establish that the vehicle has not been reported stolen, and (3) issue a traffic citation, the Fourth Amendment prohibits a detention in excess of that period of time. In this case, whether the period of appellant\u2019s detention is characterized as a \u201cfirst\u201d (traffic) stop followed by a \u201csecond\u201d (drug investigation) stop or as a single stop that was justifiable for two different reasons, appellant was detained much longer than was reasonable. The evidence derived from that unreasonable detention was acquired in violation of his Fourth Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">JUDGMENT REVERSED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY BALTIMORE COUNTY.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b700-10\">. In <em>Whren v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 806, 116 S.Ct. 1769, 135 L.Ed.2d 89 (1996), the Supreme Court held that the Fourth Amendment does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>not prohibit a law enforcement officer who observes a traffic violation from stopping the motorist who committed that violation, even though the true reason for the stop is the officer\u2019s interest in investigating whether the motorist is involved in other criminal activity. Forcible traffic stops recognized as proper by that decision have become known as <em>Whren </em>stops.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b702-10\">. Based on the seizure of cocaine from appellant\u2019s vehicle, a search warrant was issued for his residence, and the resulting search yielded additional cocaine, drug paraphernalia, and weapons. Appellant was arrested and transported to the police station, where he made a written statement in which he admitted that he had recently obtained approximately four and one half ounces of cocaine and that, on an ongoing basis, he had been distributing cocaine in the Catonsville area.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b703-10\">. At the suppression hearing, appellant also argued that his written statement should be suppressed because (1) his requests to see an attorney were ignored; (2) he was informed that he would receive a less severe penalty in exchange for a statement; and (3) he was \"badgered\u201d by detectives into giving the statement. We affirmed the circuit court\u2019s ruling that appellant's statement was voluntary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b703-11\">. When reviewing the circuit court's denial of a motion to suppress, we consider only the record of the suppression hearing and we give great deference to that court\u2019s factual findings unless clearly erroneous. <em>Trusty v. State, </em>308 Md. 658, 670, 521 A.2d 749 (1987); <em>Aiken v. State, </em>101 Md.App. 557, 563, 647 A.2d 1229 (1994); <em>cert. denied, </em>337 Md. 89, 651 A.2d 854 (1995). We, however, make our own independent, constitutional appraisal of the police conduct at issue. <em>McMillian v. State, </em>325 Md. 272, 281, 600 A.2d 430 (1992).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b705-6\">. It is also well settled that, subject to narrow exceptions such as properly executed roadblocks or checkpoints, the Fourth Amendment protects motorists against forcible stops based on less than reasonable articulable suspicion. <em>Goode </em>v. <em>State, </em>41 Md.App. 623, 629-630, 398 A.2d 801 (1979); <em>In re Albert </em>S., 106 Md.App. 376, 392-393, 664 A.2d 476 (1995); <em>Lawson v. State, </em>120 Md.App. 610, 619-620, 707 A.2d 947 (1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b707-6\">. If the K-9 had been present at the moment of the stop, or arrived during the period of permissible detention, its \"perimeter search\u201d of appellant's vehicle would have been entirely proper.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b707-7\">. This is not a case in which an extended detention of the motorist could be justified by the need to administer a \"field sobriety\u201d test or by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>technical difficulties in determining the status of the motorist\u2019s license or the ownership of the vehicle that has been stopped. The police knew that appellant had a valid driver's license and that he was the registered owner of the vehicle he was driving.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
