(\u201cHayfields\u201d), owner of Hayfields Farm (the Farm), proposed to develop its 475-acre Baltimore County property into a residential community of single-family dwellings and a country club with an 18-hole golf course and other related facilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">Hayfields filed a petition for special exception with the Baltimore County Zoning Commission to permit the proposed country club on the Farm. Hayfields also submitted a development plan for nearly 300 acres of the Farm, which included the country club and a portion of the residential component of the project. Valleys Planning Council, Inc., and several individually named adjacent and nearby property owners (collectively \u201cVPC\u201d), protested the subdivision and development of the Farm. The Zoning Commissioner granted Hayfields\u2019 petition and approved the development plan. VPC appealed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The County Board of Appeals of Baltimore County (the Board) approved the petition for special exception, subject to certain conditions, and also approved the development plan but reduced from five to three the number of lots into which the property could be subdivided. The Circuit Court for Baltimore County affirmed the Board\u2019s decisions but removed two of the conditions that had been imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-8\">Hayfields appealed and presents one question for our review, which we have rephrased:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-9\">Did the Board err in ruling that Hayfields could subdivide its 295-acre tract of R.C. 2-zoned land into only three lots?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b647-11\">VPC cross-appealed, presenting six questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>1. Did the Board err in disregarding the adverse impact of the proposed special exception use on significant on-site resources of public importance?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-4\">2. Did the Board err in its application of <em>Schultz v. PHtts?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-5\">3. Did the Board err in failing to consider the adverse impact of the proposed special exception use on the historic Hayfields Farm and National Register Historic District in which the Hayfields Farm is located?<footnotemark>[2]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-6\">4. Did the Board incorrectly impose the burden of proof on Valleys Planning Council?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-7\">5. Did the Board properly impose certain conditions on the special exception use with respect to the golf driving range?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-8\">6. Did the Board err in concluding that the definition of \u201ccountry club\u201d as used in the Baltimore County Zoning Regulations Section 101 includes a golf course plus a multiplicity of other facilities that are open to the public?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b648-9\">I. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b648-10\">Hayfields Farm has existed for nearly 200 years.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Its soil is superior to that found on other farms in the region.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> A portion of the land is still being farmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>The Farm is underlain by a geological formation known as Cockeysville Marble, a large aquifer that constitutes an important source of water for wells in the area. There are some experts who believe that the Cockeysville Marble aquifer is particularly vulnerable to contamination.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">Hayfields Farm is located on the northwest corner of the intersection of Interstate 83 and Shawan Road. To the east is a commercial area, to the south are residential developments, and to the north and west are agricultural communities. The Farm is the \u201cgateway\u201d to the rural area of Baltimore County and to the Western Run \u2014 Belfast Road National Register Historic District, a rural historic district noted for its agricultural significance. The original country home (the manor house), slaves\u2019 quarters, barns, and outbuildings were all built prior to the Civil War.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Baltimore County\u2019s Landmarks Preservation Commission (the LPC) has included these structures, seven in all, on its historic landmarks list. This designation provides the LPC with certain authority over proposed renovations of any listed structure. <em>See </em>Baltimore County Code \u00a7\u00a7 26-540 through 26-555 (requiring the LPC to issue a certificate of appropriateness or notice to proceed to the building engineer prior to exterior changes being made to privately owned, landmarks-designated structures).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>Hayfields\u2019 plan is to build an 18-hole golf course, driving range, clubhouse, restaurant, and other related facilities. The anticipated intensity of play at the golf course, which will be open to the public, is 45,000 rounds per year. This level of play is lower than' that at other public golf courses in Baltimore County but higher than the level at almost all of the private courses in the area.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">VPC is concerned that development of the property will destroy invaluable agricultural and historical assets, resources that are allegedly of benefit to the general public. The premier and highly productive Farm with a history encompassing agricultural, political, and legal components is uniquely deserving of preservation, says VPC. Moreover, VPC believes that the chemicals applied to the golf course may contaminate the water in the Cockeysville Marble aquifer and nearby wells.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">In terms of zoning restrictions on the land on which the Farm lies, the property is split-zoned under the County\u2019s R.C. 2 and R.C. 4 zoning classifications. Both of these zones are designated for resource conservation: R.C. 2 is zoned agricultural, and R.C. 4 is zoned for watershed protection. Although the use of land for single-family dwellings is permitted as of \u201cright\u201d (i.e., permitted without conditions) in both R.C. 2 and R.C. 4 zones, use of land for a country club in these zones is permissible only by special exception (i.e., permitted providing certain conditions have been met).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">Prior to breaking ground on this project, the Baltimore County Code (BCC) and the Baltimore County Zoning Regulations (BCZR) required Hayfields to obtain approval from the Zoning Commissioner for the proposed country club as a special exception use. <em>See </em>BCC \u00a7 26-127; BCZR \u00a7\u00a7 1A01.2.C and 502. In addition, the project\u2019s development plan had to be approved under the procedures detailed in BCC \u00a7 26-206. As part of this process, a development plan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>that involves historically significant buildings or sites is subject to additional reviews. <em>See </em>BCC \u00a7 26-205(a)(ll) and 26-207(a)(3); <em>see also </em>BCC \u00a7 26-545. Finally, approval must be requested for any variances necessary to comply with the BCZR.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>See </em>BCZR \u00a7 307.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-4\">A. Petition for Special Exception and Development Plan</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">1. <em>Petition for Special Exception</em></p>\n<p id=\"Amqt\">In the spring of 1995, Hayfields filed with Lawrence E. Schmidt, Zoning Commissioner for Baltimore County, a petition for special exception for a country club on approximately 228 acres of the Farm.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The petition requested the Zoning Commissioner to approve the use of the land for an 18-hole golf course open to the public, with a limited membership component; a driving range with 30 tees, 3 target greens, and nighttime lighting; a pro shop; tennis and swimming facilities; a clubhouse; a public restaurant; a banquet hall; and limited overnight accommodations. Hayfields anticipated that the Farm\u2019s manor house would become the clubhouse, restaurant, and banquet hall; the building once used as slaves\u2019 quarters would be transformed into the pro shop; and the barns would be used for storage.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">The Zoning Commissioner held a five-day public hearing and heard testimony from a variety of experts in the fields of agriculture, traffic engineering, hydrology and environmental science, environmental engineering, renovation of historic buildings, and landmarks preservation. Thirteen lay witnesses, many of whom live near the site, also testified. Additionally, the Baltimore County Zoning Plans Advisory Committee, comprised of several government agencies including the Office of Planning and Zoning and the Department of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>Environmental Protection and Resource Management, reviewed the zoning petition and submitted non-binding recommendations to the Zoning Commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">Based on <em>Schultz v. Pritts, </em>291 Md. 1, 432 A.2d 1319 (1981), Commissioner Schmidt analyzed the nature of the adverse impact associated with Hayfields\u2019 proposal. Following the Commissioner\u2019s conclusion that the impact on the locale surrounding the proposed site did not warrant the denial of the special exception, he granted Hayfields\u2019 petition and approved the site plan on June 30, 1995. VPC noted an appeal to the Board, which we discuss <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">2. <em>Submission of the Development Plan</em></p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">In the spring of 1996, Hayfields submitted a development plan for Commissioner Schmidt\u2019s approval. The plan amended the number of R.C. 2 acres for the country club from approximately 225 acres to 273.1 acres and also included 21.8 acres of R.C. 2 land to be used for residential dwellings (for a total of 295 acres of R.C. 2 land incorporated in the development plan). At this time, Hayfields also filed two more zoning petitions \u2014 a petition for special hearing and a petition for variances.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Mr. Schmidt heard Hayfields\u2019 petitions in his capacity as Zoning Commissioner; with respect to the development plan, he acted in his capacity as Baltimore County Hearing Officer.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In the combined hearings, we refer to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>Commissioner Schmidt as Zoning Commissioner/Hearing Officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-4\">A four-day hearing was held on the development plan and the zoning issues. Testimony was presented by various witnesses, including experts who were involved in formulating the development plan, several individual property owners in the area, a land planner, and representatives from the County Department of Permits and Development Management, the Department of Environmental Protection and Resource Management, the Planning Board, the Agricultural Preservation Program, and the State Highway Administration.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">The Zoning Commissioner/Hearing Officer issued an order on June 12, 1996. The order, <em>inter alia, </em>approved the development plan, permitting the creation of a total of five lots on the site. VPC noted an appeal to the Board from this order.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">B. Appeals to the Board of Appeals of Baltimore County</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">1. <em>Appeal from the Order Granting the Special Exception</em></p>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">The Board conducted a <em>de novo </em>review of the Zoning Commissioner\u2019s grant of the special exception and heard over seven days of testimony. On August 6, 1996, Hayfields\u2019 petition for special exception was approved by the Board, subject to conditions, including restrictions that the golf practice facility/driving range: (1) is limited to use by those individuals preparing for play or completing a round of play on the golf course, and outside of this limitation, available for use by members only; and (2) is limited to 30 tees, of which no more than 15 may be in operation at any one time. VPC appealed to the Circuit Court for Baltimore County from the approval of the special exception. Hayfields also filed a petition requesting review of several of the Board\u2019s conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-9\">2. <em>Appeal from the Order Approving the Development Plan</em></p>\n<p id=\"b653-10\">The Board conducted an \u201con the record\u201d review of the approval of the development plan. On September 12, 1996, the Board affirmed the Zoning Commissioner/Hearing Offi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>cer\u2019s approval of the development plan but ruled that only three lots can be created on the Hayfields site.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">The Board disagreed with the Zoning Commissioner/Hearing Officer\u2019s conclusion that the \u201ccounty club lot should be considered as the exercise of a single right of subdivision,\u201d which would give Hayfields the right to create five lots on the R.C. 2-zoned property. According to the Board, the country club is a special exception use that occupies an area of 273.1 acres, and the permissible number of lots on the remaining 21.8 acres designated for residential use is limited to two lots, for a total of three lots. Hayfields filed, in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County, a petition for review of the Board\u2019s lot limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">C. Consolidated Appeal Before the Circuit Court</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">The Circuit Court for Baltimore County (Smith, J.) granted Hayfields\u2019 motion to consolidate the petition for review of the Board\u2019s decisions and orders in the two cases. Following a hearing, the court entered its written opinion and order on June 11, 1997, affirming the Board\u2019s approval of the petition for special exception but striking two of the conditions that the Board imposed \u2014 the restriction that the golf practice facility can be used only by those preparing for, or ending play on, the golf course and otherwise limiting use of the practice facility to members only and the restriction that only 15 tees may be in use at one time. The trial court also affirmed the Board\u2019s conditional approval of the development plan, i.e., with the three-lot limitation. Hayfields appealed and VPC cross-appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">We will present additional facts as necessary to resolve the issues presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-8\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b654-9\">As we stated recently in <em>Colao v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>109 Md.App. 431, 675 A.2d 148 (1996) (quoting <em>Columbia Road Citizens\u2019 Assoc. v. Montgomery County, </em>98 Md.App. 695, 698, 635 A.2d 30 (1994)), <em>aff'd, </em>346 Md. 342, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>697 A.2d 96 (1997)), there are two general standards of review of a decision of a zoning board:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-4\">In regard to findings of fact, the trial court cannot substitute its judgment for that of the agency and must accept the agency\u2019s conclusions if they are based on substantial evidence and if reasoning minds could reach the same conclusion based on the record; when reviewing findings of law, however, no such deference is given the agency\u2019s conclusions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b655-5\"><em>People\u2019s Counsel v. Prosser Co., </em>119 Md.App. 150, 167-68, 704 A.2d 483, <em>cert. denied, </em>349 Md. 494, 709 A.2d 139 (1998). We review the decision of the Board, not the decision of the trial court, <em>see Department of Educ. v. Shoop, </em>119 Md.App. 181, 196, 704 A.2d 499, <em>cert. denied, </em>349 Md. 495, 709 A.2d 140 (1998), and apply the standard stated in <em>Prosser Co.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"ALqP\">A. Hayfields\u2019 Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">To reiterate, the Zoning Commissioner/Hearing Officer approved Hayfields\u2019 development plan with five subdivision lots in the Farm\u2019s R.C. 2 acreage, one lot for the country club and four lots for residential development. The Board affirmed approval of the plan but held that the number of subdivision lots permitted in this acreage is limited to three lots, two residential lots and one lot attributed to the country club. The Board explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-8\">We concur [with Mr. John Lewis, who represented the County\u2019s Department of Permits &amp; Development Management, Zoning Review Section] that the R.C. 2 acreage designated for the golf course is not a density calculation since it does not bear any relationship to dwellings or bedrooms but, rather, is a special exception usage that occupies a designated area, and that the remainder of the R.C. 2 acreage designated for residential use carries its own density based on the expressed formula of two lots for up to 100 acres, or one lot per 50 acres.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>Additionally, we concur with the portion of the Department of Permits &amp; Development Management that an owner cannot use his acreage twice to support two different uses, i.e., a residential use permitted as of right and a special exception (such as country club). We believe that the distinction is important because of its impact and interpretation as development occurs in other R.C. 2 zones. This interpretation of the Board, we believe, is consistent with the spirit and intent of the R.C. 2 legislation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">In an R.C. 2 zone, the formula for calculating subdivision lot density, i.e., the number of lots that can be created from a given tract of land, is based on the number of acres comprising that tract. The issue presented by Hayfields requires us to determine how many of the Farm\u2019s 295 acres designated for the country club and single-family dwellings form the <em>gross acreage </em>from which the number of lots for the residential component can be derived. We must decide whether the County\u2019s zoning regulations require that the 273.1 acres approved for country club use should be excluded prior to a determination of the number of residential lots into which the balance of the R.C. 2 acreage (21.8 acres) can be divided. Two interrelated questions must be considered. First, should the 273.1 acres be subtracted from the 295 acres because the country club is a special exception use, rather than a use permitted as of right, as is the plan for single-family dwellings on the remaining 21.8 acres? Alternatively, must the 273.1 acres be subtracted because the country club is a non-residential use, in contrast -with the residential use proposed on the remainder of the R.C. 2 tract, thus involving different considerations from those that otherwise would exist if <em>all </em>of the 295 acres were to be used for residential development? Resolution of these questions presents issues of law, and as such, we afford no deference to the Board\u2019s determination. <em>See Richmarr Holly Hills, Inc. v. American PCS, L.P., </em>117 Md.App. 607, 652, 701 A.2d 879 (1997) (citing <em>Lee v. Maryland Nat\u2019l Capital Park and Planning Comm\u2019n, </em>107 Md.App. 486, 492, 668 A.2d 980 (1995), <em>cert. denied, </em>343 Md. 333, 681 A.2d 69 (1996)).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>The foundation of Hayfields\u2019 argument is that, under the plain language of BCZR. \u00a7 1A01.3.B.1 through .4, it can subdivide the 295-acre tract of R.C. 2-zoned land into five lots. Under these regulations, asserts Hayfields, the acreage dedicated to the country club does not have to be removed prior to calculating the maximum number of lots that are available for the residential dwellings. Hayfields explains that the zoning regulations applicable to an R.C. 2 zone incorporate neither a distinction between residential and nonresidential uses nor a distinction between special exception uses and uses permitted as of right. According to Hayfields, there is only one formula for calculating subdivision lot density in an R.C. 2 zone, and that formula permits the subdivision lot density to be computed from the overall acreage of the tract, notwithstanding the fact that the use on one lot will be different from the use proposed for the remaining lots. In Hayfields\u2019 view, it therefore is immaterial that the country club represents a nonresidential use (versus a residential use) and a special exception use (versus a use permitted by right).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-4\">BCZR \u00a7 1A01.3.B provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-5\">1. Subdivision lot density. No lot of record lying within an R.C. 2 zone and having a gross area of less than 2 acres may be subdivided. No such lot having a gross area between 2 and 100 acres may be divided into more than 2 lots (total), and such a lot having a gross area of more than 100 acres may be subdivided only at the rate of 1 lot for each 50 acres of gross area....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">BCZR \u00a7 1A01.3.B.2 through .4 provides additional restrictions. Each lot created in an R.C. 2 zone must have an area not less than one acre, BCZR \u00a7 1A01.3.B.2; no dwelling or principal structure in an R.C. 2 zone may be situated within 75 feet of the centerline of any street or within 35 feet of any lot line other than a street line, BCZR \u00a7 1A01.3.B.3; and no more than one principal dwelling is permitted on any lot in an R.C. 2 zone, BCZR \u00a7 1A01.3.B.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">We agree with Hayfields that the plain language of these R.C. 2 zoning regulations does not distinguish between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>residential and nonresidential uses nor between uses permitted by special exception and permitted as of right.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Based on the terms of BCZR \u00a7 1A01.3.B.1, the maximum yield for Hayfields is five lots. A lot of record having a gross area in excess of 100 acres may be subdivided at a rate of one lot for every 50 acres of gross area; therefore, a lot of record with a gross area of 295 acres, such as the Hayfields tract, may be subdivided into a maximum of five lots. Hayfields\u2019 plan to create five lots also meets the minimum area, setback, and dwelling limit requirement in BCZR \u00a7 1A01.3.B.2 through .4.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">Because Hayfields argues that it is not required to subtract the 273.1 R.C. 2 acres dedicated to the special exception country club use for purposes of calculating the number of lots for residential development that it can create in the remaining 21.8 R.C. 2 acres, VPC asserts that Hayfields is seeking to \u201cdouble use\u201d acreage. In other words, according to VPC, Hayfields is attempting \u201cto use the 273.1 acres <em>twice </em>to support two different uses \u2014 a residential use permitted as a matter of right and a special exception country club use.\u201d VPC states that the clear language of BCZR \u00a7 1A01.3.B.1, when read together with BCZR \u00a7 102.2, prohibits such \u201cdouble use.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">Under the BCZR\u2019s general requirements, BCZR \u00a7 102.2 states: \u201cNo yard space or minimum area required for a building or use shall be considered as any part of the yard space or minimum area for another building or use.\u201d VPC posits:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-6\">[I]t is plain that a yard space that has already been dedicated to a special exception use may not also be considered as part of the minimum area to support a residential use. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>Accordingly, in the present case, the yard space dedicated to the special exception country club use (any part of the 273.1 acres) may not be considered as part of the minimum area in support of the proposed residential use of four lots in the R.C.-2 zone (200 acres).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b659-4\">Hayfields disputes the characterization that it is attempting to double-count acreage. So do we. We agree with Hayfields\u2019 position that BCZR \u00a7 102.2 is inapplicable to the calculation of <em>subdivision lot density </em>in an R.C. 2 zone. The prohibitions on double-using \u201cyard space\u201d and \u201cminimum area\u201d will be addressed separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">\n<em>Yard, Space</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">We interpret the term \u201cyard space\u201d as being relevant to the setback requirements of BCZR \u00a7 1A01.3.B.3.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Although the BCZR does not provide a definition of \u201cyard space,\u201d \u201cyard\u201d is defined as \u201c[a]ny open space located on the same lot with a building.... The minimum depth or width of a yard shall consist of the horizontal distance between the lot line and the nearest point of the foundation wall of the main building.\u201d BCZR \u00a7 101. Hayfields\u2019 proposal to subdivide its 295 R.C. 2-zoned acres into five lots meets all the setback requirements under BCZR \u00a7 1A01.3.B.3. And in accordance with BCZR \u00a7 102.2, each one of the five lots meets the setback requirements without using depth or width demarcations from any other lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">\n<em>Minimum Area</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b659-8\">With regard to the prohibition on double-using \u201cminimum area,\u201d VPC argues that \u201cminimum lot area\u201d refers to the one acre minimum lot size in BCZR \u00a7 1A01.3.B.2, but \u201cminimum area,\u201d the term used in BCZR \u00a7 102.2, refers to the gross acreage required by BCZR \u00a7 1A01.3.B.1 to divide the tract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>into a given number of lots. Because 273.1 acres have already been dedicated for the country club use, VPC says that this acreage cannot be considered as part of the lot of record\u2019s gross area when contemplating the remaining subdivisions. To create four lots for <em>residential use, </em>as Hayfields wishes to do, VPC states that the \u201cminimum area\u201d requirement of BCZR \u00a7 1A01.3.B.1 calls for a minimum of 200 acres. We interpret BCZR \u00a7 102.2\u2019s prohibition on using minimum area to support more than one use (or building) as being relevant only to the one acre lot size requirement of BCZR \u00a7 1A01.3.B.2 and disagree with the distinction VPC makes between minimum lot area (or minimum lot size) and minimum area.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">We read BCZR \u00a7\u00a7 1A01.3.B.2 and 102.2 together as preventing a situation in which, for example, a developer proposes to use a 250-acre tract in an R.C. 2 zone to create a 248-acre golf course in conjunction with four residential lots. BCZR \u00a7 102.2 prohibits such a proposal because in order to meet the one acre minimum lot size requirement of BCZR \u00a7 1A01.3.B.2, two acres would have to be \u201cborrowed\u201d from the golf course lot, thus double-using acreage.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">Hayfields\u2019 plan, however, meets the lot size requirement of BCZR \u00a7 1A01.3.B.2. In accordance with BCZR \u00a7 102.2, each of the five lots meets the one acre minimum without having to \u201cborrow\u201d acreage from one of the other lots.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">\n<em>Density Requirement</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b660-8\">Before addressing VPC\u2019s next argument, we note that both parties agree that R.C. 2 zoning regulations do not provide a method for calculating residential density as a discretional use.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> VPC states, however, that, according to \u00a7 102.2 of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>Zoning Commission\u2019s Policy Manual, \u201cresidential density may only be calculated \u2018on the overall property acreage if all uses are residential.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Therefore, \u201cto the extent there are nonresidential uses on the lot, the acreage dedicated to the nonresidential use may not be considered in calculating residential density.\u201d In support of this proposition, VPC states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-5\">[T]here is no formula for calculating residential density in the R.C.-2 zone. Instead, density in the R.C.-2 zone is determined by number of lots, as opposed to number of dwelling units. Thus, for all intents and purposes, \u201cresidential density\u201d in the R.C.-2 zone is \u201csubdivision lot density,\u201d particularly because only one dwelling unit is permitted per lot in the R.C.-2 zone. Thus, in making a density determination, whether it be by number of lots in the R.C.-2 zone or by number of dwelling units in the D.R. zone, a developer should not be permitted to \u201cdouble use\u201d acreage to achieve <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>a higher density than contemplated by the Zoning Regulations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">(Citation to record extract and footnote omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">Once again, we agree with Hayfields\u2019 response to VPC\u2019s position. Hayfields explains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-6\">As the language of the relevant BCZR sections indicates, the calculation of residential density determines <em>the number of residential density units </em>which may be developed on a single tract of land; by contrast, the calculation of subdivision lot density determines <em>the number of lots </em>which may be subdivided from a lot of record in the R.C. 2 zone.... [VPC\u2019s] interpretation ignores the fact that, unlike the calculation of \u201cresidential density,\u201d the calculation of \u201csubdivision lot density\u201d does not contemplate subdivision based on distinctions among land uses; the subdivision lot density calculation does not consider the land uses which will be developed on the subdivided lots.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">Moreover, VPC\u2019s reliance upon the Zoning Commission\u2019s Policy Manual \u00a7 102.2.A is misplaced. This section applies to a situation in which two uses are proposed on the same lot. In the case before us, Hayfields\u2019 development plan proposes only one use for each of the five lots created from the subdivision of the 295-acre, R.C. 2-zoned portion of the development site. The 273.1-acre lot is allocated to the country club and the remaining four lots will be developed into single-family residences.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-8\">\n<em>Deference to Agency Interpretation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b662-9\">VPC also argues that, under <em>Morris v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>319 Md. 597, 613, 573 A.2d 1346 (1990) (holding that in the face of legislative acquiescence a longstanding administrative interpretation is presumed to be correct), the Board properly gave deference to the testimony of Mr. John Lewis, a planner with the County\u2019s Department of Permits and Development Management (the PDM). Mr. Lewis testified before the Zoning Commissioner/Hearing Officer that the consistent practice of the PDM and the County generally, extending over <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>the last ten years, is that a property owner cannot \u201cuse his acreage twice\u201d to support two different uses, such as residential uses permitted as of right, on the one hand, and special exception uses such as a country club, on the other. To this Hayfields retorts that, if the Board should afford deference to an agency representative\u2019s interpretation, it should afford deference to the decision of the Zoning Commissioner/Hearing Officer.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b663-4\">Assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that the longstanding, consistent practices of the PDM and the County generally should be given deference, there was insufficient evidence in the record of a \u201clongstanding and consistent practice of the PDM.\u201d As Hay-fields points out, the two cases cited by Mr. Lewis to show PDM\u2019s interpretation do not in fact demonstrate a longstanding agency practice of subtracting special exception acreage prior to calculating residential subdivision lot density in an R.C. 2 zone.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">\n<em>Legislative Purpose</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">VPC\u2019s final argument is that \u201cdouble use\u201d of acreage in determining subdivision lot density is inconsistent with the legislative purpose of the R.C. 2 zoning classification. The resource conservation zone\u2019s purpose is to \u201cprotect both natural and man-made resources from compromising effects of specific forms and densities of development.\u201d BCZR \u00a7 lA00.2(c). We reject VPC\u2019s argument because, paradoxically, the formula for calculating subdivision lot density advocated by VPC may result in the creation of a greater number of lots compared with the result achieved under the formula we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>hold as correct. For example, a development plan for a 295-acre tract may designate 15 acres for use as a private school (a special exception use in an R.C. 2 zone) and 280 acres for use as single-family dwellings. With the approval of the special exception use, the acreage for the residential component could thereafter be subdivided into five lots, for a total of six lots under VPC\u2019s formulation. \u201cOur\u201d formula would allow, of course, a maximum of five lots.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">In summary, according to the plain language of BCZR \u00a7 1A01.3.B.1 through .4, the area for a special exception use in an R.C. 2-zoned property should not be removed prior to the calculation of subdivision lot density even though the development plan calls for residential use on the remaining acreage. The method for calculating subdivision lot density in an R.C. 2 zone is not analogous to that for calculating residential density in other zones. Instead, R.C. 2 zone subdivisions are created purely on available acreage under the formula previously stated, subject only to other special limitations, such as minimum lot size and set back. The Board erred in reversing the Zoning Commissioner/Hearing Officer\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">B. VPC\u2019s Cross-Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">1. <em>Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">\u201cZoning is the legislative division of a community into areas in each of which only certain designated uses of land are permitted so that the community may develop in an orderly manner in accordance with a comprehensive plan.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> 1 E.C. Yokley, <em>Zoning Law and Practice </em>\u00a7 2-1, at 15-16 (4th ed.1978) (footnote omitted). Within any given zoning classification, the BCZR prescribes two types of uses: certain uses are permitted as of right and others are conditionally permissible. Golf courses and country clubs are conditionally per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>missible uses in the County\u2019s R.C. 2 zones, BCZR \u00a7 1A01.2.C.10, and also in the R.C. 4 zones, BCZR \u00a7 1A03.3.B.7.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-4\">A use permitted as of right may be developed, as a matter of zoning, regardless of the kind and extent of adverse impact (from a land use perspective) it will create in the particular location proposed. <em>Schultz, supra, </em>291 Md. at 21, 432 A.2d 1319. On the other hand, a conditional use, i.e., a use permitted by special exception, may be developed only under certain circumstances. <em>Id. </em>at 22, 432 A.2d 1319. In <em>Schultz, </em>the Court of Appeals noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-5\">The special exception use is a part of the comprehensive zoning plan sharing the presumption that, as such, it is in the interest of the general welfare, and therefore, valid. The special exception use is a valid zoning mechanism that delegates to an administrative board a limited authority to allow enumerated uses which the legislature has determined to be permissible <em>absent any fact or circumstance negating the presumption.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b665-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 11, 432 A.2d 1319; <em>see also Rockville Fuel &amp; Feed Co. v.

In the instant case, the standards that must be met are found in BCZR \u00a7\u00a7 1A01.2.C and 502.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-8\">BCZR \u00a7 1A01.2.C provides that a petition for special exception use may be granted in an R.C. 2 zone if \u201cthe hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>authority empowered to hear the petition finds that the use would not be detrimental to the primary agricultural uses in its vicinity.\u201d BCZR \u00a7 502.1 lists eight factors that negate a special exception\u2019s presumption of validity. Only two of the eight factors in BCZR \u00a7 502.1 are raised in this appeal. Under BCZR \u00a7 502.1:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-5\">\u2014Before any Special Exception may be granted, it must appear that the use for which the Special Exception is requested will not:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-6\">a.

Be inconsistent with the purposes of the property\u2019s zoning classification nor in any other way inconsistent with the spirit and intent of these zoning regulations.<footnotemark>[18]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AC_\">By definition, each special exception use carries with it a potential to cause adverse effects. If no constraint were placed on BCZR \u00a7 502.1(a), in particular, when evaluating the acceptability of a special exception use, few special exceptions would be granted. Precedent has developed to govern the application of factors, such as those in BCZR \u00a7 502.1, in analyzing the propriety of a special exception use in a particular location. As stated in <em>Mossburg, </em>\u201c[b]y reason of the holdings in <em>Schultz, supra, </em>and its progeny, such general conditions as are applied to special exceptions are themselves subject to the limitation that the adverse effects must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>greater than or above and beyond the effects normally inherent with such a use anywhere within the relevant zones in the regional district.\u201d <em>Mossburg, supra, </em>107 Md.App. at 21, 666 A.2d 1253.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-4\">In <em>Mossburg, </em>Judge Cathell for this Court provided an example of how to \u201coverlay\u201d the statutory conditions of a county\u2019s special exception law with the restrictions in <em>Schultz. Mossburg, </em>107 Md.App. at 21-22, 666 A.2d 1253. Based on the <em>Mossburg </em>example, we have added the limiting language of <em>Schultz </em>to BCZR \u00a7 502.1(a). The test becomes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-5\">\u2014Before any Special Exception may be granted, it must appear that the use for which the Special Exception is requested will not:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-6\">a. Be [more] detrimental to the health, safety, or general welfare of the <em>locality </em>involved [than the effects normally inherent with such a use would be generally elsewhere in the zone].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">(Emphasis added.) We have thus far not discussed the extent or limitation of the term \u201clocality,\u201d as used in BCZR \u00a7 502.1(a). This issue is addressed in the next subsection.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-8\">2. <em>On-Site Impact of Proposed Special Exception Use</em></p>\n<p id=\"b667-9\">The parties disagree on the appropriate method of evaluating Hayfields\u2019 proposal under BCZR \u00a7 502.1, in light of <em>Schultz. </em>VPC argues that the adverse impacts analysis must not only consider off-site impact, i.e., impact to the surrounding and neighboring properties, but must include an examination of on-site impact, i.e., adverse impact to the subject property itself. Hayfields counters that <em>Schultz </em>mandates the evaluation of off-site impacts only. The difference in the parties\u2019 interpretations is of particular significance in the instant case because of the Farm\u2019s unique agricultural and historical character.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-10\">In response to Hayfields\u2019 petition for special exception, Commissioner Schmidt opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-11\">Whether the Hayfields property should remain a farm is irrelevant, <em>within the context of this case. </em>It does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>matter whether the Hayfields property represents the most significant farm in Baltimore County.... The test for approval of the use, and the only test, is whether the special exception criteria within Section 502.1 of the B.C.Z.R. are satisfied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">The Zoning Commissioner concluded that <em>Schultz </em>and its progeny require that he \u201cadjudge the impacts of the use on neighboring properties, only\u201d and that the potential impacts on the subject property itself are not to be considered.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">The Board agreed. VPC disagrees with the Zoning Commissioner\u2019s interpretation of <em>Schultz </em>and claims that the Board misunderstood the requirements for approving a special exception use.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">In the previous subsection, we have introduced the <em>Schultz </em>holding that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-8\">the appropriate standard to be used in determining whether a requested special exception use would have an adverse effect and, therefore, should be denied is whether there are facts and circumstances that show that the particular use proposed at the particular location proposed would have any adverse effects above and beyond those inherently associated with such a special exception use irrespective of its location within the zone.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b668-9\"><em>Schultz, </em>291 Md. at 22-23, 432 A.2d 1319. In reaching its decision, the Court discussed <em>Deen v. Baltimore Gas &amp; Elec. Co., </em>240 Md. 317, 330-31, 214 A.2d 146 (1965) (concerning construction of high tension transmission wires above ground) and <em>Anderson, supra, </em>23 Md.App. at 617-18, 329 A.2d 716 (concerning construction of a funeral home in a residential zone), and explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-10\">These cases establish that a special exception use has an adverse effect and must be denied when it is determined from the facts and circumstances that the grant of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>requested special exception use would result in an <em>adverse effect upon adjoining and surrounding properties unique and different </em>from the adverse effect that would otherwise result from the development of such a special exception use located anywhere within the zone.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b669-4\"><em>Schultz, </em>291 Md. at 15, 432 A.2d 1319 (emphasis added). <em>Been </em>and <em>Anderson </em>both involved proposed special exception uses in Baltimore County. BCZR \u00a7 502.1(a) was at issue in those two cases, as it is here.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">Although conceding that the holding in <em>Schultz </em>speaks of off-site effects, VPC stresses that the test articulated by the <em>Schultz </em>Court comparing the \u201cparticular location\u201d with the area elsewhere in the zone should not be limited to off-site effects. In an attempt to distinguish the instant case from <em>Schultz </em>and cases that have followed <em>Schultz, </em>VPC postulates:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-6\">The only reason that the Court in <em>Schultz </em>spoke at all in terms of adverse effects on adjoining or neighboring properties was because those happened to be the kinds of effects that were relied upon by the protestants in <em>Schultz. </em>The same is true of both the cases cited by the Court in <em>Schultz, </em>and the cases decided subsequent to <em>Schultz. </em>In none of these cases were any \u201cunique\u201d qualities intrinsic to the site alleged to be adversely impacted by the proposed conditional use. However, the fact that the effects cited by the protestants in <em>Schultz </em>and other appellate cases were effects on adjoining properties does not mean that the special exception test should not take into account, where appropriate, adverse impacts which will occur on the property that is the subject of the application.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">From VPC\u2019s viewpoint, the development of the Farm will result in a loss of unique on-site resources, such as the Farm\u2019s prime and productive soils and its value as an historic site, both of which are <em>public </em>resources. VPC observes that the legislature, by creating the R.C. 2 zoning classification, has declared explicitly that agricultural resources are of value to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>the general public.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> VPC\u2019s appraisal continues with the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-5\">The Board\u2019s erroneous exclusion of adverse impacts on the property itself occurred because the Board failed to appreciate the difference between impacts on resources of admitted public importance or significance (which may be found either on or off site) and \u201cprivate\u201d impacts on the value or use of neighboring properties.... The Board erred in only considering the private impacts on adjoining properties, and by failing to consider the loss of important agricultural and historical resources within the four corners of the property itself. When an important public resource is harmed, even where the resource is located on the special exception site itself, everyone is harmed \u2014 including both the general public and the owners of other properties in the locality. Evidence of such harm cannot be ignored by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>Board, but must be evaluated as a part of the special exception process.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b671-4\">(Footnote omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">Due to the alleged threat to public resources on the Farm itself, VPC argues that the <em>Schultz </em>test should be applied in a different manner in the instant case.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> VPC\u2019s theory furnishes two categories of on-site impacts that the Board needed to consider but did not:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-6\"><em>Characteristics of the specific proposal </em>which are unusual or not generic to the type of facility, and which arguably result in unusual detriments, must be considered, and <em>features of the particular sites </em>or areas selected which are not commonly or routinely found throughout the zone and which thus pose unusual detriments specific to the facility or site under review can and must be considered in applying the standards of both Section 502.1 and Section 1A01.2.C.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"APF\">(Emphasis added.) VPC provides the following as an example of \u201ccharacteristics of the specific proposal.\u201d According to VPC, the projected level of play at the proposed golf course is nearly twice as high as the overall average rounds played at private 18-hole golf courses in the County. Given the fact that the proposed golf course allegedly is atypical in generated activity when compared with a \u201cgeneric golf course,\u201d VPC contends that any potential on-site detriments to the Farm resulting from the golf course\u2019s atypical level of activity should be examined. Under the second category, \u201cfeatures of the particular site,\u201d VPC states that any detriments to the Farm\u2019s uncommonly productive soil and its unusually rich historical significance should be evaluated.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">VPC presents an interesting approach to the law of special exceptions, but it cites no case that supports its position. On the contrary, numerous cases support the proposition that the Board was correct in looking only at the off-site effects of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>proposed special exception use. For applications of the <em>Schultz </em>test, see <em>Harford County v. Earl E.

Five of the seven cases we cited above directly quote this portion of <em>Schultz </em>that establishes the Board\u2019s duties in its judicial review of the grant or denial of a special exception use. <em>See Preston, </em>322 Md. at 498, 588 A.2d 772; <em>Holbrook, </em>314 Md. at 216, 550 A.2d 664; <em>Evans, </em>112 Md.App. at 302, 685 A.2d 454; <em>Sharp, </em>98 Md.App. at 76, 632 A.2d 248; <em>Mangione, </em>85 Md.App. at 748, 584 A.2d 1318. Furthermore, none of the seven cases suggests that, in certain circumstances, an additional duty of the Board may involve the examination of on-site impacts under the <em>Schultz </em>test. We hold that absent a stricter standard clearly expressed in the County\u2019s zoning regulations, or until the relevant case law is modified by the Court of Appeals, the current expression of the <em>Schultz </em>test applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>We agree with Hayfields\u2019 contention that \u201calthough the adverse impacts considered by the Board vary according to the special exception use requested, the \u2018adverse effect analysis,\u2019 i.e., the <em>Schultz </em>review standard, used by the Board when evaluating adverse impacts, necessarily remains constant.\u201d The Board, therefore, correctly limited its adverse impacts analysis under BCZR \u00a7 502.1, as modified by the language in <em>Schultz, </em>to off-site effects.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">Nothing in the BCZR contradicts our conclusion that off-site impact is the only type of impact for which the Board should scrutinize the proposed special exception use. In fact, BCZR \u00a7 1A01.2.C, which lists the uses permitted by special exception in an R.C. 2 zone, offers additional support for our holding. The regulation permits the grant of a special exception for specified uses in an R.C. 2 zone only if \u201cthe use would not be detrimental to the primary agricultural uses <em>in its </em>vicinity.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) We contrast this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>condition<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> with the additional conditions placed on special exception uses listed in Item 24 of BCZR \u00a7 1A01.2.C. Uses under Item 24 include the following as principal commercial uses: farm-machinery sales, feed or grain mills, fertilizer sales or storage uses, and others. A special exception may be granted for a use under Item 24 if \u201cthe use would support the primary agricultural use in its vicinity and would not itself be situated on land more appropriately used for primary agricultural uses.\u201d BCZR \u00a7 1A01.2.C. Under BCZR \u00a7 1A01.2.C., on-site impact to agricultural use should be considered only for a very limited number of special exception uses, which are found under Item 24; a country club use is <em>not </em>included among the uses so specified.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">3. <em>Board\u2019s Application of Schultz v. Pritts to Off-Site Environmental Effects</em></p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">VPC also argues that the Board\u2019s analysis of the country club\u2019s potential adverse impact on the Cockeysville Marble aquifer demonstrates the Board\u2019s \u201cmisunderstanding and misapplication\u201d of the <em>Schultz </em>test with respect to off-site matters. As we have noted, this aquifer is one of the best sources of groundwater in the locality. Under BCZR \u00a7 502.1(a) and <em>Schultz, </em>the special exception use cannot be granted if the proposed country club use is more detrimental to the health, safety, or general welfare of properties adjoining and surrounding the selected site than a country club would be if it were located elsewhere in the R.C. 2 zone.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">VPC\u2019s expert, Stephen L. Mogilnicki, testified that the Cockeysville Marble weathers irregularly, resulting in \u201csolution cavities\u201d that \u201ctend to carry or allow the passage of contaminants further and at faster velocity\u201d compared with other formations. According to Hayfields\u2019 expert, Stephanie <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>N. Hau, however, there is a clay layer that overlays the Cockeysville Marble that acts as a filter to prevent or retard the flow of any contaminants into the aquifer below. Ms. Hau stated that the presence of the clay \u201cslow[s] down the infiltration of rain water, allowing natural microbial processes to break down and essentially eat the nitrate [from fertilizers] that would get into the groundwater system and pesticides.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ATe\">The Board stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-5\">The bulk of scientific testimony concerning subsoil effects of the proposed use comes from Ms. Hau,<footnotemark>[25]</footnotemark> Mr. Mogilnicki,<footnotemark>[26]</footnotemark> and Dr. [William P.] Ball.<footnotemark>[27]</footnotemark> Ms. Hau provided information concerning subsurface conditions and proposed well locations, with references to the Environmental Impact Report, construction monitoring plan, and other work to be performed as part of the development process, i.e., mowing plans, integrated pest management plans, etc. A single well is expected to accommodate the entire project, that well being located centrally in the site and to the south of an on-site ridge line, whereas other well/septic systems generally are located to the north of that same ridge line. Ms. Hau opined that there would be no impact on groundwater in wells on or near the property. She also provided an interesting look at the public\u2019s perception of golf courses as being a \u2018toxic waste dump,\u2019 pointing out that golf courses are not simply blanketed with chemicals. She described <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>subsurface conditions as including a relatively consistent clay layer between the surface and the underlying Cockeysville marble and other formations, this point being somewhat strongly contested by Dr. Ball. In light of Dr. Ball\u2019s testimony, and Mr. Mogilnicki\u2019s, concerning the effects of contaminant percolation to the subsurface formations, the Board recognizes that the clay layer is both desirable and universally used to mitigate such concerns. The question for the Board is whether the impacts associated with the proposed use are greater here than elsewhere in the R.C. 2 zone. <em>It is this Board\u2019s view that, while it is debatable whether the Cockeysville marble or other formations are more or less susceptible to contaminants than other formations, those same formations are found elsewhere in the R.C. 2 zone. Therefore, the Board finds there was insufficient evidence that the potential effects on the subsurface formations and groundwater would be greater at the instant site than elsewhere in the zone.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-5\"><em>In light of the proposed well and septic field locations being leeward of other wells to the north of the on-site ridge, as well as the acknowledgment by fpjrotestants\u2019 witnesses that the existence of clay improves the possibility for microbial action to occur in mitigating some of the concerns related to the contaminants, this Board believes that the proposed site is no worse than elsewhere in the R.C. zone. The effects of the well on neighboring properties were not demonstrated as likely to be worse here than at other locations in the R.C. zone. </em>Therefore, this Board finds that there was insufficient evidence that the proposed use would have a greater detrimental impact to the health or safety of the vicinity at this location.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">In regard to the effect of the proposed golf course on the aquifer, the experts disagreed as to the first three of the following four questions, <em>viz:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-8\">1. Is the quality of the groundwater protected by a clay layer to such an extent that, by the clay layer alone or in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>conjunction with implementation of the golf course management plan developed for the property, there would be no adverse impact to the aquifer in the proposed location?<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-4\">2. Would the clay layer protect the Cockeysville Marble aquifer to such an extent that components of fertilizers, pesticides, and other chemicals used on the golf course are no more likely to reach the aquifer and pollute the groundwater than if the golf course was underlain by another type of soil layer?<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-5\">3. Is the Cockeysville Marble more susceptible to contamination than other rock formations in the R.C. 2 zone?<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-6\">4. What percentage of the remainder of the R.C. 2 zone is underlain by Cockeysville Marble?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">The Board did not resolve the first question. The Board strongly implied that it believed that the clay layer testified to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>by Ms. Hau at least helped in lessening the danger to water quality caused by possible contaminants from the golf course. The Board noted that even VPC\u2019s witnesses acknowledged \u201cthat the existence of clay improves the possibility for microbial action to occur in mitigating some of the concerns related to the contaminants.\u201d Although the Board recited Ms. Hau\u2019s testimony that, in her opinion, \u201cthere would be no impact on groundwater in wells on or near the property\u201d caused by the proposed golf course, the Board did not say whether it credited that testimony.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">The Board made no comparison, such as stated in question two, as to whether the adverse effect on the groundwater from the golf course chemicals would be worse at the proposed site as compared with the area generally in the R.C. 2 zone. In regard to question three, the Board merely said that the issue was debatable (i.e., \u201cit is debatable whether the Cockeysville [MJarble or other formations are more or less susceptible to contaminants than other formations\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">Rather than deciding questions one, two, and three, the Board avoided them by saying in effect that, although it is debatable that the Cockeysville Marble formation is more susceptible to contaminants than other subsurface formations, Cockeysville Marble is found in other parts of the R.C. 2 zone, and therefore there was insufficient evidence that the potential adverse effect on the groundwater caused by the golf course would be greater at the proposed site than elsewhere in the R.C. 2 zone. As VPC correctly points out, this finding does not comport with the test set forth in <em>Schultz. </em>Assuming that Cockeysville Marble <em>is </em>more susceptible to contamination, the mere fact that <em>some </em>of the land elsewhere in the R.C. 2 zone is underlain with Cockeysville Marble does not mean that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>effect would be no worse at this locality than elsewhere in the zone.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">We, therefore, will remand the case to the circuit court with instructions to remand the case to the Board to resolve certain questions. If the Board, in answer to any of the questions that we have numbered one, two, or three, believes that the proposed golf course does not pose a threat to water quality in the aquifer, the Board should say so and the legal problem would be resolved. If, on the other hand, it believes that the proposed golf course does pose a threat to the aquifer\u2019s water quality because it is above Cockeysville Marble, then the Board should determine how much of the off-site portion of the comparable R.C. 2 zone is underlain by that subsurface formation.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> <em>If </em>all or a substantial portion of the off-site R.C. 2 land is underlain by Cockeysville Marble then it is at least possible that the Board could fairly conclude that the golf course, at its proposed site, would cause no more contamination to the aquifer than if it were located elsewhere in the R.C. 2 zone.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Conversely, if the Board finds that only a relatively <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>small portion of the off-site R.C. 2-zoned land is underlain with Cockeysville Marble, and if it also finds that the Cockeysville Marble formation makes the aquifer more susceptible to contamination, then it cannot be said that the golf course at the intended site would pose no greater danger to groundwater than if it were located elsewhere in the R.C. 2 zone.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">4. <em>Impact of the Proposed Use on Historic Hayfields Farm and the National Register Historic District</em></p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">The premise of VPC\u2019s next argument is that the Board did not evaluate the potential harm to the historical value of the Farm itself and of the Western Run \u2014 Belfast Road National Register Historic District caused by Hayfields\u2019 proposed development. VPC\u2019s concern is based on the fact that the Farm: (1) contains seven structures listed on the County\u2019s \u201cLandmarks List\u201d; (2) is the gateway property of the Western Run \u2014 Belfast Road National Register, a district known for its agricultural significance; and (3) is the \u201cpremiere agricultural site\u201d in the County because of its agricultural history. VPC states that the Board, instead of considering the on-site or off-site detriments of historical significance, \u201cconcluded that Hay-fields is <em>only </em>required to follow Baltimore County\u2019s Development Regulations calling for review of proposed alterations to historic structures in the subsequent Development Plan process by the Landmarks Preservation Commission and Planning Board.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">First, as we already have discussed at length, on-site detriment is not to be considered under the <em>Schultz </em>test. It is the off-site loss potentially sustainable by the Western Run\u2014 Belfast Road National Register Historic District that we now consider.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-8\">Under BCZR \u00a7 502.1(a), a special exception use is prohibited if it is \u201cdetrimental to the health, safety, or <em>general welfare </em>of the locality involved.\u201d (Emphasis added.) We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>accept the premise that the preservation of historically significant structures, land, and districts promotes the general welfare. But, as we have stated previously, to warrant the denial of a petition for special exception, the detriment to adjoining or surrounding properties at the instant site must be different from the detriment that would occur elsewhere in the zone. <em>Schultz, </em>291 Md. at 15, 432 A.2d 1319. \u201cIf the evidence makes the question of harm or disturbance ... fairly debatable, the matter is one for the Board to decide.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 11, 432 A.2d 1319; <em>see also Sharp, </em>98 Md.App. at 82, 632 A.2d 248 (quoting <em>Holbrook, </em>314 Md. at 218, 550 A.2d 664).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">The \u201cfairly debatable\u201d standard is in accord with the \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d standard of review. <em>See Evans, </em>112 Md. App. at 298, 685 A.2d 454 (citing <em>Umerley v. People\u2019s Counsel, </em>108 Md.App. 497, 503, 672 A.2d 173, <em>cert. denied, </em>342 Md. 584, 678 A.2d 1049 (1996)). These standards ensure that judicial review is limited to \u2018\u201cwhether a reasoning mind reasonably could have reached the factual conclusion the agency reached; this need not and must not be either judicial fact-finding or a substitution of judicial judgment for agency judgment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Holbrook, </em>314 Md. at 218, 550 A.2d 664 (quoting <em>Supervisor of Assessments v. Ely, </em>272 Md. 77, 84, 321 A.2d 166 (1974)). Under this standard, we afford deference to the Board\u2019s findings of fact and applications of law to fact.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-5\">The Board said that it recognized</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aq_\">that any proposals such as the country club will have an effect on the surrounding vicinity. The question, once again, is whether those effects will be greater here than elsewhere in the zone. The instant site is at the edge of the urban/rural demarcation line, and is bounded by Interstate 83 to the east, which sees substantial large-scale commercial development at elevations much higher than the existing site. Were this project placed elsewhere in the R.C. zone, the effects of increased traffic, impact on views, other natural opportunities, and so forth, would be far greater as opposed to this location. Concerning the historic nature of the manor house and other structures on the site, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>Petitioner proposes to adaptively reuse all such structures in the development of the country club. Nowhere in the zoning regulations is a Petitioner compelled to maintain an historic structure \u201cas is\u201d; a Petitioner is only required to follow the development regulations and work within those regulations as they may pertain to historic structures, and whatever interaction as may be required with the Landmarks Preservation Commission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">The Board held that the country club at the proposed site will not have a greater adverse impact on the general welfare of the surrounding vicinity than if it were located elsewhere in the zone.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">Testifying on behalf of VPC were Ruth Mascari, Chair of the Baltimore County Landmarks Preservation Commission, and James T. Wollon, Jr., an architect specializing in historic preservation.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Ms. Mascari testified that the development of the proposed project on the Farm \u201cwill have an extremely adverse impact on the Western District.\u201d Mr. Wollon drew a similar conclusion.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> He delineated various changes he believed would result in adverse effects on the historic district, which were:<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>(1) losing the property\u2019s open vistas;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-4\">(2) modifying the property\u2019s historic structures;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-5\">(3) following development, the Farm \u201cwill no longer be a farm\u201d and \u201cwill no longer look like a farm\u201d; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-6\">(4) \u201cremov[ing] the property ... [will] remove the setting of the historic house.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">The Farm\u2019s manor house \u201chappens to be the biggest of all the houses in th[e] [historic] district\u201d and the Farm is \u201cthe first site seen upon the most common entrance to the district,\u201d \u2022according to Mr. Wollon. He also testified that the Western Run \u2014 Belfast Road and Worthington Valley historical districts<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> were \u201coutstanding historic districts\u201d and that \u201cthe qualities that make them qualify in the first place are still there, and they are very rare and outstanding for the whole Baltimore region.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b684-8\">VPC contends that the Board \u201ceop[ped] out\u201d and \u201cabdicated its responsibility to consider matters of adverse historic impact in passing on special exception applications, by holding that its authority to rule on land use impacts and changes must be entirely jettisoned and replaced solely by the Landmark Commission\u2019s more limited authority relative to development plan and building permit details.\u201d We disagree. Although the Board did not say explicitly that, <em>in terms of the Western Run </em>\u2014 Belfast <em>Road Historic District, </em>the adverse effects of the proposed development of the instant site were no greater than those that would occur in other areas of the zone, it did make findings with regard to each of the factors that Mr. Wollon raised in his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-9\">To satisfy VPC\u2019s concerns regarding the third and fourth of Mr. Wollon\u2019s factors, the Board would have to have required Hayfields to preserve the agricultural character of the Farm. The only way to accomplish this objective is to require Hay-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>fields to continue farming on the tract or not to permit them to do anything -with the property that would preclude farming. But, as the Board recognized, Hayfields cannot be forced to continue its farming operation. To forestall any non-agricultural use, simply to achieve the goal of agricultural preservation, raises the \u201ctakings\u201d spectra.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-4\">Whether there was significant loss of open vistas was \u201cfairly debatable\u201d because there was substantial evidence in the record to support the Board\u2019s finding that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-5\">[t]he instant site is at the edge of the urban/rural demarcation line, and is bounded by Interstate 83 to the east, which sees substantial large-scale commercial development at elevations much higher than the existing site. Were this project placed elsewhere in the R.C. zone, the effects of increased traffic, <em>impact on views, </em>other natural opportunities, and so forth, would be far greater as opposed to this location.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">Finally, the Board did not err in holding that Hayfields\u2019 proposal to reuse adaptively the historic structures on the site would preserve, to a satisfactory degree, the historic nature of these structures. The only way to satisfy VPC on this issue would have been to require the property owner to continue farming to keep the buildings in their proper historic setting. Again, the Board does not have the authority to enforce such a requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-8\">We conclude that there was sufficient evidence in the record to make the potential impact on general welfare fairly debatable and, therefore, the issue was one for the Board to decide. We hold that the Board adequately reviewed the impact of the proposed development on the relevant vicinity, which includes the National Register Historic District.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-9\">5. <em>Burden of Proof</em></p>\n<p id=\"b685-10\">VPC argues that, based on two isolated statements contained in the Board\u2019s opinion on the environmental impacts of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>the proposed development, the Board improperly imposed the burden of proof, under BCZR \u00a7 502.1 and <em>Schultz, </em>on VPC rather than on Hayfields. VPC quotes the following excerpts from the Board\u2019s opinion: (1) \u201cTherefore, the Board finds there was insufficient evidence that the potential effects on the subsurface formations and groundwater would be greater at the instant site than elsewhere in the zone\u201d; and (2)</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-4\">The effects of the [golf course] well on neighboring properties were not demonstrated as likely to be worse here than at other locations in the R.C. zone. Therefore, this Board finds that there was insufficient evidence that the proposed use would have a greater detrimental impact to the health or safety of the vicinity at this location.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">Because we are remanding the case regarding the environmental impact issue, we note it is clear that the <em>Schultz </em>test does require the <em>applicant </em>(i.e., Hayfields) to show, under BCZR \u00a7 502.1(a), that the use for which the special exception is requested will not be \u201cdetrimental to the health, safety, or general welfare of the locality involved.\u201d<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">Additionally, VPC declares that because the Board incorrectly placed the burden of proof on it with respect to the environmental issues \u201c[t]his supports an inference that the Board similarly misplaced the burden of proof throughout its Opinion.\u201d VPC provides no support for its assertion. We find none and reject the assertion. A review of the Board\u2019s entire decision leads us to believe that the Board was guilty, at most, of merely inartful word usage and was well aware of the burden of proof requirements of BCZR \u00a7 502.1(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>6. <em>Conditions on Practice Facility \u00a1Driving Range</em></p>\n<p id=\"b687-4\">VPC appeals from the circuit court\u2019s reversal of two of the Board\u2019s limitations on the use of the practice facility/driving range. The conditions at issue here (1) limit the use of the driving range to people who are using the golf course or who are members, and (2) limit to 15 the number of practice tees that can be in operation at one time.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">The Board held that a practice range is \u201ca natural and appropriate facility\u201d in conjunction with a golf course but noted that a driving range is not permitted as a special exception use in an R.C. 2 zone. According to the Board, therefore, the practice facility would have to serve a <em>subordinate use </em>to the country club. Given the subordinate use requirement, the Board restricted the use of the practice facility to those who are preparing to play (or ending a round of play) on the golf course or to those who are members. Following the imposition of this limitation, the Board stated that \u201c[i]n light of the limited use expected on the practice facility, no more than 15 tees shall be available for use at any one time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">The parties have chosen different methods by which to analyze this issue. VPC conducts a mixed \u201csubordinate use\u201d and \u201cintensity of use\u201d analysis, whereas Hayfields solely employs an \u201cintensity of use\u201d analysis.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-7\">VPC asserts that the Board</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-8\">approved the driving range facility here as a <em>subordinate use </em>to the country club, and therefore placed certain conditions upon it. As each of the conditions are supported by evidence in the record and represent a reasonable effort by the Board to insure that the practice range would be subordinate to the golf course, and thus an \u201cappropriate facility,\u201d the circuit court erred in striking the conditions relating to who may use the facility and the number of tees that may be used at one time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b687-9\">(Citation to the record omitted.) VPC then proceeds with the observation that because the driving range was approved as a subordinate use, \u201cthe intensity of use of the driving range <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>must be commensurate with, if not subordinate to, the use of the golf course.\u201d A similar conclusion was drawn by VPC in regard to the limitation of the number of tees available for use at one time. Finally, VPC contends that these conditions were imposed by the Board \u201cfor the protection of surrounding and neighboring properties.\u201d<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">In contrast, Hayfields argues that the Board already recognized the practice range as an \u201cappropriate facility.\u201d Given this fact, the only issue before the Board regarding potential conditions it could place on the facility concerned its \u201cintensity of use.\u201d This analysis required the Board to find, under BCZR \u00a7 502.2, that the conditions it intended to impose were \u201cappropriate or necessary to protect the surrounding properties.\u201d <footnotemark>40</footnotemark> In Hayfields\u2019 view, because the Board failed to make such findings, the circuit court properly struck the conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">With respect to the restriction on who can use the practice facility, the proper analysis is one of \u201csubordinate use.\u201d Under BCZR \u00a7 101, \u201ccountry club\u201d is defined as \u201c[a] 9 or 18-hole golf course with a clubhouse and other appropriate facilities.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Given the fact that a driving range is not permitted as a special exception use in an R.C. 2 zone, the Board reasonably imposed this \u201cuse condition\u201d to ensure that the driving range does not become \u201ca freestanding public attraction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">We take a different approach in considering the Board\u2019s restriction on the number of practice tees. Once the Board determined that the <em>non-public driving range </em>was an \u201cappropriate facility\u201d in conjunction with the proposed golf course, subsequent conditions placed on the driving range must meet the criteria under BCZR \u00a7 502.2.

VPC argues that the term \u201ccountry club\u201d as used in the BCZR should be construed as meaning a \u201cnon-profit facilit[y] operated exclusively for use by members and their guests.\u201d Under this definition, VPC contends that the Board\u2019s approval of the special exception was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">BCZR \u00a7 101 defines \u201ccountry club\u201d as \u201c[a] 9 or 18-hole golf course with a clubhouse and other appropriate facilities, which may include other recreational facilities <em>(see Section </em>Jp06A).\u201d (Emphasis added.) The basis for VPC\u2019s argument is that because of the cross-reference to BCZR \u00a7 406A, which defines \u201cneighborhood tennis club\u201d as a non-profit association for members and guests only, the County Council intended the word \u201cclub\u201d to denote a non-profit, exclusive facility. Apparently because (1) both the definitions of \u201ccountry club\u201d and \u201cneighborhood tennis club\u201d were added to the zoning regulations by the same bill, and (2) the term \u201cclub\u201d is common to both \u201ccountry club\u201d and \u201cneighborhood tennis club,\u201d VPC believes that the non-profit, private membership requirements of tennis clubs under BCZR \u00a7 406A are applicable to country clubs under BCZR \u00a7 101.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">We disagree with VPC\u2019s analysis. Under the plain language of BCZR \u00a7 101, there is no limitation on the term <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>\u201ccountry club.\u201d The County Council, however, did impose a limitation when it adopted the definition of a \u201cneighborhood tennis club.\u201d If the drafters of the Baltimore County Zoning Regulations had wanted to define \u201ccountry club\u201d as being limited to a non-profit and exclusive entity, it is logical to believe that it would have used language similar to that employed in BCZR \u00a7 406A. <em>Cf.
