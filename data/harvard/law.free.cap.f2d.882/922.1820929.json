HIGGINBOTHAM, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1018-30\">Louis Cruz pled guilty to possession of approximately 3 kilograms of marihuana with intent to distribute in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(D), and was sentenced to a 51-month prison term. On appeal, he challenges only his sentence. He contends that the district court misapplied the sentencing guidelines, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), by finding that he was a \u201ccareer offender\u201d under Guideline \u00a7 4B1.1 and by failing to deduct two points from his career offender offense level for acceptance of responsibility as provided in Guideline \u00a7 3E1.1. Finding no error in the sentence imposed, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-31\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-32\">Cruz first challenges the district court\u2019s finding that he was a \u201ccareer offender\u201d within the meaning of the Guidelines. Guideline \u00a7 4B1.1 provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1018-33\">A defendant is a career offender if (1) the defendant was at least eighteen years old at the time of the instant of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"923\">*923</page-number>fense, (2) the instant offense of conviction is a felony that is either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense, and (3) the defendant has at least two prior felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1019-5\">The district court concluded that Cruz was at least 18 years old, that his instant offense was a \u201ccontrolled substance offense,\u201d and that he had two prior felony convictions, one which qualified as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d and another which qualified as a \u201ccontrolled substance offense.\u201d Cruz argues that the district court erred by finding that his prior convictions for burglary and illegal investment qualified, respectively, as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d and a \u201ccontrolled substance offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-6\">A. BURGLARY OF A HABITATION</p>\n<p id=\"AvQ\">Cruz contends that his prior conviction for burglary of a habitation under Tex.Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 30.02 (Vernon 1979) does not qualify as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 4B1.1 because there was no evidence that force was used or threatened during the commission of that offense. This argument is meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-7\">The term \u201ccrime of violence\u201d as used in \u00a7 4B1.1 is defined under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16. Guideline \u00a7 4B1.2(1). Section 16 provides: The term \u201ccrime of violence\u201d means\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1019-8\">(a) an offense that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1019-9\">(b) any other offense that is a felony and that, <em>by its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1019-10\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-11\">In <em>United States v. Flores, </em>875 F.2d 1110, 1113 (5th Cir.1989), we concluded that burglary of a dwelling was a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under \u00a7 4B1.1, noting that \u201c[w]henever a private residence is broken into, there is always a substantial risk that force will be used.\u201d Importantly, Application Note 1 of the Commentary to \u00a7 4B1.2 specifically states that burglary of a dwelling is a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d The district court therefore correctly concluded that Cruz\u2019 prior conviction for burglary of a habitation qualified as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under \u00a7 4B1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-13\">B. ILLEGAL INVESTMENT</p>\n<p id=\"AAE\">Cruz next argues that the district court erred by finding that his prior conviction for illegal investment under Tex.Rev. Civ.Stat.Ann. art. 4476-15 \u00a7 4.052 (Vernon Supp.1989) qualified as a \u201ccontrolled substance offense.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-14\">The term \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d as used in Guideline \u00a7 4B1.1 is defined as \u201can offense identified in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841, 845b, 856, 952(a), 955, 955a, 959; <em>and similar offenses.\u201d </em>Guideline \u00a7 4B1.2(2) (emphasis added). Application Note 2 of the Commentary to \u00a7 4B1.2 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AYd\">\u201cControlled substance offense\u201d includes any federal or state offense that is substantially similar to any of those listed in subsection (2) of the guideline. These offenses include manufacturing, importing, distributing, dispensing, or possessing with intent to manufacture, import, distribute, or dispense, a controlled substance (or a counterfeit substance). This definition also includes aiding and abetting, conspiring, or attempting to commit such offense, and other offenses that are substantially equivalent to the offenses listed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1019-15\">Under Texas law, a person commits the offense of illegal investment if he knowingly or intentionally (1) expends funds that he knows are derived from the commission of certain enumerated narcotics offenses, or (2) finances or invests funds he knows or believes are intended to further the commission of such an offense. Tex.Rev.Civ. Stat.Ann. art. 4476-15 \u00a7 4.052(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"924\">*924</page-number>4.052(a)(1) lists as applicable narcotics offenses \u00a7\u00a7 4.05(c) and 4.051(c), which proscribe the delivery and possession of more than fifty pounds of marihuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-4\">Cruz admits that he pled guilty to the offense of illegal investment but argues that it does not constitute a \u201ccontrolled substance offense.\u201d We find sufficient evidence in the record to support the trial court\u2019s finding that Cruz was convicted under Section 4.052(a)(2) for financing or investing funds which he knew or believed were intended to further the commission of a listed narcotics offense \u2014 the possession or delivery of over fifty pounds of marihuana. The offense reports of this incident, which were admitted into evidence without objection, indicate that Cruz and another individual named Vaquera drove to a rest area where undercover officers had agreed to sell Vaquera marihuana; that Vaquera had already given the officers over $8,000; and that when he arrived with Cruz he had $10,000 with which he intended to purchase 100 pounds of marihuana. The probation officer testified at the sentencing hearing that eighty-eight pounds of marihuana were actually involved. Cruz disputes the extent of his involvement in the transaction and argues that there is insufficient evidence to support the trial court's ruling that his conduct amounted to a conspiracy to possess marihuana with intent to distribute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-5\">To determine whether Cruz\u2019 prior conviction for illegal investment qualifies as a \u201ccontrolled substance offense,\u201d we need not decide whether the facts underlying that conviction would support a conviction for conspiracy to possess marihuana with intent to distribute. We need only decide whether the offense defined under Tex. Rev.Civ.Stat. art. 4476-15 \u00a7 4.052(a)(2) is \u201csubstantially similar\u201d to the offenses listed as \u201ccontrolled substance offenses\u201d in Guideline \u00a7 4B1.2(2). <em>See </em>Application Note 2 of the Commentary to \u00a7 4B1.2. Section 4.052(a)(2) proscribes financing or investing funds known or believed to be intended to further the commission of a listed narcotics offense. We find that this offense is \u201csubstantially equivalent to the offenses listed\u201d in \u00a7 4B1.2(2), which includes aiding and abetting, conspiring, and attempting to commit a listed narcotics offense. <em>See </em>Application Note 2 of the Commentary to \u00a7 4B1.2. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s finding that Cruz\u2019 prior conviction for illegal investment qualified as a \u201ccontrolled substance offense,\u201d holding as a matter of law that a conviction under Tex. Rev.Civ.Stat.Ann. art. 4476-15 \u00a7 4.052(a)(2) constitutes a \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d under Guideline \u00a7 4B1.1. In reaching our conclusion, we express no opinion as to whether a conviction under subsection (1) of the Texas statute, which proscribes the expenditure of funds derived from the commission of a listed narcotics offense, qualifies as a \u201ccontrolled substance offense.\u201d Finding that Cruz has two prior felony convictions, one which qualifies as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d and another which constitutes a \u201ccontrolled substance offense,\u201d we affirm the trial court\u2019s ruling that Cruz is a \u201ccareer offender\u201d within the meaning of Guideline \u00a7 4B1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-10\">Finally, Cruz contends that the district court erred by failing to deduct two-points from his career offender offense level for acceptance of responsibility as provided in Guideline \u00a7 3E1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-11\">Although this is a question of first impression in our circuit, both the First and Third Circuits have recently concluded that the Guidelines do not provide for a two-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility from the sentencing levels set for career offenders. <em>See United States v. Alves, </em>873 F.2d 495 (1st Cir.1989); <em>United States v. Huff, </em>873 F.2d 709 (3d Cir.1989). We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"925\">*925</page-number>Instructions for applying the Sentencing Guidelines are found in Guideline \u00a7 161.1. First, a base offense level is taken from the Chapter Two guideline section most applicable to the statute of conviction. \u00a7\u00a7 1BL-1(a) and (b). Adjustments, including the adjustment for acceptance of responsibility, are then made to obtain the total offense level. \u00a7\u00a7 lBl.l(cHe). The defendant\u2019s criminal history category is then determined. \u00a7 lBl.l(f). Next, the court considers whether the career offender or criminal livelihood provisions of Chapter 4, Part B apply, which may provide an alternative offense level and criminal history category. \u00a7 lBl.l(f). \u201cIf the offense level for a career criminal from the table below [the career criminal table] is greater than the offense level otherwise applicable, the offense level from the table below shall apply.\u201d \u00a7 4B1.1. \u201cThe career offender table has no provisions for adjustments and a career offender\u2019s criminal history category is always Category VI.\u201d \u00a7 4B1.1. Finally, the guideline range is determined under Chapter 5, Part A based on the total offense level and criminal history category. \u00a7 lBl.l(g). Thus, if the instructions are followed in sequence, the adjustments found in \u00a7\u00a7 lBl.l(cHe), including the adjustment for acceptance of responsibility, will not be applied to the career offender offense level. <em>Accord Alves, </em>873 F.2d at 497; <em>Huff, </em>873 F.2d at 713.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-5\">In the instant case, the trial judge noted that the base level for the drug offense was 12. He reduced the offense level to 10, finding Cruz entitled to the acceptance of responsibility deduction as provided by \u00a7 3E1.1. The judge then found that Cruz was a \u201ccareer offender\u201d under \u00a7 4B1.1 and that his career offender offense level was 17. Since the career offender offense level of 17 was greater than the total offense level of 10, the judge used the career offender offense level and criminal history category to calculate Cruz\u2019 guideline range under Chapter 5, Part A. The range for sentences under offense level 17, criminal history category VI is 51-63 months. Based on the government\u2019s recommendation under the plea agreement, the court sentenced Cruz to 51 months. Cruz argues that the trial court should have reduced his career offender offense level from 17 to 15 for acceptance of responsibility. The range for sentences under offense level 15, criminal history category VI is 41-51 months. Cruz contends that under the plea agreement he should have been sentenced to only 41 months. We find that the district court properly applied the guidelines in accordance with the instructions provided in Guideline \u00a7 1B1.1, and are unable to conclude that the Sentencing Commission intended the court to proceed otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-7\">Recent amendments to Guideline \u00a7 4B1 support our conclusion. The criminal livelihood section, \u00a7 4B1.3, was amended to permit the acceptance of responsibility deduction while amendments to \u00a7 4B1.1, governing career offenders, made no such provision. As the First Circuit has stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1021-8\">If the Commission believed that all defendants who fit within Chapter 4, Part B were entitled to the acceptance of responsibility reduction, then the amendment to \u00a7 4B1.3 was unnecessary. Moreover, had the Commission wished to include career offenders in the group of defendants eligible for the reduction, it would have done so at the same time and in the same manner that it amended \u00a7 4B1.3.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1021-9\"><em>Alves, </em>873 F.2d at 498. <em>See also Huff, </em>873 F.2d at 714 (amendment allowing acceptance of responsibility reduction in cases under \u00a7 4B1.3 tends to indicate that Commission did not intend reduction to apply under \u00a7 4B1.1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-10\">Finally, we cannot ignore Congress\u2019 mandate to the Sentencing Commission to ensure that defendants who qualify as \u201ccareer offenders\u201d receive sentences of imprisonment \u201cat or near the maximum level\u201d authorized by statute. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(h).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"926\">*926</page-number>The Commission established career offender offense levels in \u00a7 4B1.1 to implement this directive. <em>See </em>Commentary to Guideline \u00a7 4B1.1. Guideline \u00a7 4B1.1 makes no allowance for such adjustments and we will not frustrate the policy behind Congress\u2019 directive by permitting such deductions from career offender offense levels. <em>Accord Alves, </em>873 F.2d at 498 (Congress\u2019 mandate to Commission to sentence career offenders to prison terms at or near statutory maximum would be undercut by allowing acceptance of responsibility deduction from career offender offense level); <em>Huff, </em>873 F.2d at 713 (same). We therefore join the First and Third Circuits in concluding that the two-point deduction for acceptance of responsibility does not apply in setting the career offender offense level.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-4\">For the reasons stated above, the sentence imposed by the district court is, in all respects,</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1019-16\">.
