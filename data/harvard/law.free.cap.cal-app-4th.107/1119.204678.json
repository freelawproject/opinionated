Luri (Luri) failed to file timely oppositions to the defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment and did not appear for the hearing on the motions. Luri\u2019s subsequent motion for reconsideration and relief under Code of Civil Procedure sections 473 and 1008 was denied. Luri argues on appeal that the trial court abused its discretion in denying the motion under Code of Civil Procedure section 473 (section 473), that the trial court was required to grant relief under the mandatory relief provision of that statute for attorney fault even though there was no specific request for mandatory relief, and that the matter should be remanded for a hearing on the summary judgment motions. We hold that a motion under section 473 seeking discretionary relief accompanied by the declaration of an attorney suggesting attorney fault does not require the trial court to grant relief under the mandatory provision for attorney fault when there is no request for such mandatory relief. We also hold that in this case the trial court committed no error in treating the motion as seeking only discretionary relief under section 473 and did not abuse its discretion in finding no excusable neglect. We therefore affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-11\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-12\">Luri purchased a duplex from the Greenwalds in 1997 in a sale in which the real estate defendants acted as the sellers\u2019 agents. Luri subsequently sued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1122\">*1122</page-number>the Greenwalds and the real estate defendants, alleging that in the course of the sale they committed fraud; concealment; conspiracy to defraud; and violations of the Civil Code\u2019s real estate disclosure provisions, Civil Code section 1102 et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-4\">The Greenwalds filed a motion for summary judgment on July 10, 2001, with a hearing on their motion set for August 8, 2001. The real estate defendants filed a motion for summary judgment on July 18, 2001, with the hearing on that motion scheduled for August 15, 2001. The hearing on the Greenwalds\u2019 motion for summary judgment was postponed until August 15, 2001, so that the two summary judgment motions could be heard together.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-5\">Luri\u2019s opposition papers to the summary judgment motions were required to be filed by August 1, 2001 (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, subd. (b)), but she failed to file any oppositions. On August 10, 2001, Luri\u2019s attorney, Sheldon Kaufman (Kaufman), submitted an ex parte application for a continuance of the hearing on the summary judgment motions and a corresponding extension of his time to file oppositions to the motions. In a declaration accompanying the application, Kaufman declared that although he \u201cworked many long hours each day to attempt to prepare meaningful and consistent opposition to the two separate motions by August 1, 2001,\u201d he could not complete them in a timely manner. He represented to the court that \u201c[t]he opposition to both motions is about 65% completed and can be served and filed by August 15, 2001, at the latest, if this matter is continued until August 28, 2001, at 9:00 a.m. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-6\">The defendants opposed Luri\u2019s application for a continuance on the ground that a continuance should not be needed because the summary judgment motions raised only one issue\u2014the statute of limitations. The trial court granted Luri\u2019s application and continued the hearings on the summary judgment motions to August 30, 2001. The trial court stated that Luri\u2019s oppositions would now be due within \u201cthe statutory period of time before 8/30/01\u201d\u2014under Code of Civil Procedure section 437c, subdivision (b), not less than 14 days preceding the hearing date. The court also advised Luri\u2019s counsel \u201cthat there will be no further continuances or extensions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-7\">Despite the extension granted by the court and the court\u2019s warning, the new due date for Luri\u2019s oppositions passed without service or filing of any oppositions to the summary judgment motions. As of the date of the summary judgment motions hearing, no oppositions had been filed, and Luri and her counsel failed to appear for the hearing. The trial court\u2019s August 30, 2001 minute order reads, \u201cBefore the hearing, the Courtroom Assistant receives a call from Plaintiff counsel\u2019s secretary stating that Plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1123\">*1123</page-number>counsel will be at least one hour late to the hearing [scheduled for 9:00 a.m.]. fl[] The Motions are called for hearing at 9:14 a.m. There is no appearance on behalf of the Plaintiff. Hj] The court has received no opposition to the Motions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-5\">The trial court conducted a hearing on the unopposed summary judgment motions and granted summary judgments to the Greenwalds and the real estate defendants. The court\u2019s August 30, 2001 minute order notes that \u201c[t]here is no appearance by the Plaintiff when the court concludes its ruling at 9:24 a.m.\u201d Kaufman arrived at the courtroom later that morning at approximately 9:50 a.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-6\">On September 13, 2001, Luri filed papers opposing the summary judgment motions that had already been heard and ruled upon on August 30, 2001. On September 17, 2001, Luri filed a motion for reconsideration of the summary judgment rulings under Code of Civil Procedure section 1008; in the alternative, Luri moved \u201cunder 473 CCP for relief from orders granting summary judgments to said defendants, upon the grounds of excusable neglect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-7\">The portion of the memorandum of points and authorities devoted to relief under section 473 read in its entirety as follows: \u201cMotion under Section 473 CCP [i[] (Excusable Neglect) ffl] The evidence and argument for the grounds of ex[]cusable neglect both as to the non-appearance and the filing of Opposition is provided by Declaration of Sheldon M. Kaufman filed concurrently her[e]with.\u201d No notice of motion accompanied this motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-8\">Kaufman\u2019s accompanying declaration stated that he arrived in the courtroom with \u201cfully completed opposition documents\u201d at 9:50 a.m. on August 30, 2001, and was told that the matter had already been heard. Concerning^ the failure to file the opposition papers in a timely manner, Kaufman stated only, \u201cDeclarant is aware that on August 10, 2001, in support of an Ex Parte Application for a Continuance of the hearing on the Motions for Summary Judgment until August 30, 2001, Declarant stated that the Opposition was about \u201865% completed\u2019 and could be filed and served by August 15, 2001 [] if the matter was continued until August 28, 2001. This assertion by Declarant proved to be overly optimistic in light of the fact that the Opposition was not in fact completed until August 29, 2001. This delay was caused in part by the complexity and intricacy of the Opposition, and, moreover, by extreme fatigue of Declarant induced by the side effects of a prescription cholesterol-lowering drug (\u2018Baycol\u2019) taken by Declarant, and recently recalled. Further, said drug has possibly caused Declarant liver damage, a matter not yet resolved.\u201d In conjunction with his reply brief, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1124\">*1124</page-number>Kaufman provided a supplemental declaration detailing his medical history with Baycol, but the declaration did not provide any explanation of how the medication had prevented him from performing legal work. Luri stated in a declaration that Kaufman and she were late for the summary judgment hearing because of an automobile problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-4\">After a hearing on October 15, 2001, Luri\u2019s motion under Code of Civil Procedure sections 1008 and 473 was denied. Judgments were entered in favor of the defendants, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-6\">Section 473, subdivision (b) provides for two distinct types of relief\u2014commonly differentiated as \u201cdiscretionary\u201d and \u201cmandatory\u201d\u2014from certain prior actions or proceedings in the trial court. \u201cUnder the discretionary relief provision, on a showing of \u2018mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect,\u2019 the court has discretion to allow relief from a \u2018judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken against\u2019 a party or his or her attorney. Under the mandatory relief provision, on the other hand, upon a showing by attorney declaration of \u2018mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect,\u2019 the court shall vacate any \u2018resulting default judgment or dismissal entered.\u2019\u201d <em>(Leader </em>v. <em>Health Industries of America, Inc. </em>(2001) 89 Cal.App.4th 603, 615-616 [107 Cal.Rptr.2d 489].) Applications seeking relief under the mandatory provision of section 473 must be \u201caccompanied by an attorney\u2019s sworn affidavit attesting to his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect.\u201d (\u00a7 473, subd. (b).) The mandatory provision further adds that \u201cwhenever relief is granted based on an attorney\u2019s affidavit of fault [the court shall] direct the attorney to pay reasonable compensatory legal fees and costs to opposing counsel or parties.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"A4F\">Luri contends that even though her section 473 motion only referred to discretionary relief, the trial court erred by not treating the motion as though it sought relief under the mandatory provision of section 473 because the motion was accompanied by a declaration of an attorney indicating his fault. Alternatively, she argues that the trial court abused its discretion by denying her motion under the discretionary provision of section 473.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-8\">I. <em>A motion under section 473 for discretionary relief accompanied by a declaration of an attorney suggesting attorney fault does not require the trial court to grant relief under the mandatory provision of section. 473.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1016-9\">Luri\u2019s argument that whenever a motion under section 473 includes a declaration by an attorney suggesting attorney fault, the trial court should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1125\">*1125</page-number>consider granting relief under both the discretionary and mandatory provisions of the statute, is not consistent with procedural rules governing motions. A basic principle of motion practice is that the moving party must specify for the court and the opposing party the grounds upon which that party seeks relief. Code of Civil Procedure section 1010 requires that a notice of motion must state \u201cthe grounds upon which it will be made.\u201d California Rules of Court, rule 311 requires a notice of motion to state in its opening paragraph \u201cthe nature of the order being sought and the grounds for issuance of the order.\u201d As a general rule, the trial court may consider only the grounds stated in the notice of motion. <em>(Gonzales v. Superior Court </em>(1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 1542, 1545 [235 Cal.Rptr. 106]; <em>Silva </em>v. <em>Holland </em>(1888) 74 Cal. 530, 531 [16 P. 385].) An omission in the notice may be overlooked if the supporting papers make clear the grounds for the relief sought. <em>(Carrasco </em>v. <em>Craft </em>(1985) 164 Cal.App.3d 796, 807-808 [210 Cal.Rptr. 599]; <em>366-388 Geary St., L.P. v. Superior Court </em>(1990) 219 Cal.App.3d 1186, 1200 [268 Cal.Rptr. 678].) The purpose of these requirements is to cause the moving party to \u201csufficiently define the issues for the information and attention of the adverse party and the court.\u201d <em>(Hernandez </em>v. <em>National Dairy Products </em>(1954) 126 Cal.App.2d 490, 493 [272 P.2d 799].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-5\">Specification of issues is no less necessary when a motion invokes section 473 than when a motion is made pursuant to any other statute. We discern no basis in law or policy to conclude that section 473 motions, unlike all other motions, should be exempt from these provisions of law. Nor do we identify any legal grounds to impose a duty upon trial courts to evaluate, sua sponte, alternative bases for relief other than those asserted by the moving party\u2014a duty that would be unique to motions under section 473. We therefore decline to hold that in evaluating motions made under section 473, the trial court must consider grounds for relief not raised or sought by the moving party.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-6\">That the trial court is not required to consider granting relief under the mandatory provision without a request for such relief is supported by the requirements of the provision. The mandatory provision provides that the \u201ccourt shall, whenever relief is granted based on an attorney affidavit of fault, direct the attorney to pay reasonable compensatory legal fees and costs to opposing counsel or parties.\u201d (\u00a7 473, subd. (b).) If the trial court considered an affidavit as one of \u201cfault\u201d requiring the imposition of mandatory compensation when the attorney meant only to state facts showing mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect, an attorney could be assessed fees and costs without having intended to accept responsibility with an \u201caffidavit of fault.\u201d Moreover, without notice that relief is sought under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1126\">*1126</page-number>mandatory provision, the opposing party may not have the opportunity to provide information on the \u201creasonable compensatory legal fees and costs\u201d required to be awarded. <em>{Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1018-4\">Luri argues that there is a problem in requiring an attorney to admit fault under oath in order to obtain relief for the client. Attorneys, she contends, will be reluctant to do so because of malpractice and malpractice insurance implications. But the Legislature has provided for mandatory relief for the client if the attorney, in effect, acknowledges \u201cfault.\u201d That the relief is mandatory should alleviate the purported inhibitions of attorneys to make such acknowledgements for the benefit of their clients. If the attorney believes that he or she had no responsibility, then the attorney would choose to make the motion under the discretionary provision of section 473 only.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-5\">The trial court is not required to consider the availability of relief under the discretionary or mandatory provisions of section 473 in the absence of any request for relief under those grounds. Just as the trial court may under appropriate circumstances overlook certain procedural deficiencies in pleadings\u2014as it did on other matters in this case (see post)\u2014it is not precluded from considering a motion under section 473 to be one under the mandatory provision. If such relief is to be considered, the parties should have fair notice of the possibility of such relief. But, when faced with a motion for relief under section 473, the trial court does not have to consider the availability of relief under the mandatory provision unless such relief is requested in an appropriate manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-6\">II. <em>The trial court did not err in treating the request as one for relief only under the discretionary provision of section 473.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1018-7\">California Rules of Court, rule 312(a) requires that the papers filed in support of a motion must include the motion itself, a notice of hearing on the motion, and a memorandum of points and authorities in support of the motion. Although these components may be combined into a single document under a caption specifying their consolidation, all three elements must be present for a valid motion. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 312(a).) Additionally, as noted above, the opening paragraph of the notice of motion must describe the grounds for the motion and the nature of the order sought. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1010; Cal. Rules of Court, rule 311.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-8\">Although only the grounds specified in the notice of motion generally may be considered by the trial court <em>(Gonzales v. Superior Court, supra, </em>189 Cal.App.3d at p. 1545; <em>Silva v. Holland, supra, </em>74 Cal. at p. 531), a trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1127\">*1127</page-number>court may overlook the failure of a notice of motion to state a ground for relief when the supporting materials discuss and support that ground for relief so that it is clear that relief is sought on that ground. In that situation, the trial court may treat the supporting papers as curing the defective notice. <em>(Carrasco v. Craft, supra, </em>164 Cal.App.3d at pp. 807-808; <em>366-388 Geary St., L.P. v. Superior Court, supra, </em>219 Cal.App.3d at p. 1200.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-5\">Luri\u2019s section 473 motion was part of a document that served as the memorandum of points and authorities for her motion under Code of Civil Procedure section 1008. Although it was entitled \u201cNotice of Motion and Motion,\u201d the documents contained no notice of motion. The caption to the document specified that if reconsideration was not granted under Code of Civil Procedure section 1008, \u201cin the alternative\u201d Luri moved \u201cunder 473 CCP for relief from orders granting summary judgments to said defendants, <em>upon the grounds of excusable neglect.\u2019'1 </em>(Italics added.) The textual section concerning section 473 read, \u201cMotion under Section 473 CCP [If] <em>(Excusable </em>Neglect) [f] The evidence and argument for <em>the grounds of exfjcusable neglect </em>both as to the non-appearance and the filing of Opposition is provided by Declaration of Sheldon M. Kaufman filed concurrently her[ejwith.\u201d (Italics added.) No further discussion of the basis for Luri\u2019s motion was included in her motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-6\">Because Luri\u2019s motion did not include a notice of motion stating \u201cthe grounds upon which [the motion] will be made\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1010) or an opening paragraph stating \u201cthe nature of the order being sought and the grounds for issuance of the order\u201d (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 311), the trial court could reasonably have rejected the entire motion as defective and noncompliant with California rules and statutes. The trial court overlooked these defects and reviewed the documents submitted to determine the specific basis upon which Luri sought relief, as permitted by <em>Carrasco v. Craft, supra, </em>164 Cal.App.3d at pages 807-808 and <em>366-388 Geary St., L.P. v. Superior Court, supra, </em>219 Cal.App.3d at page 1200.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-7\">Luri\u2019s motion papers referred three times to the ground of \u201cexcusable neglect.\u201d No basis for relief other than excusable neglect\u2014a ground for discretionary relief only\u2014was discussed or argued in Luri\u2019s motion or the supporting documents. All parties treated Luri\u2019s motion as a motion made under the discretionary relief provision\u2014one seeking relief on the grounds of excusable neglect. Luri\u2019s attorney never informed the court of any intention to move for, nor suggested the possibility of, relief under the mandatory provision of section 473. The Greenwalds did not seek compensatory fees and costs provided for under the mandatory section. They only sought sanctions for the Code of Civil Procedure section 1008 motion. And <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1128\">*1128</page-number>the real estate defendants sought fees and costs as a matter of judicial discretion\u2014not payments as required by the mandatory provision. Thus, the defendants lacked fair notice of a possibility of relief under the mandatory provision of section 473. Under these circumstances, the trial court reasonably treated Luri\u2019s motion as seeking relief only under section 473\u2019s discretionary provision.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1020-4\">III. <em>There was no abuse of discretion in denying Luri\u2019s section 473 motion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1020-5\">Luri contends that the trial court erred in denying her motion to vacate the summary judgments under the discretionary portion of section 473.  We review the trial court\u2019s ruling under the discretionary provision for an abuse of discretion. <em>(State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co. v. Pietak </em>(2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 600, 610 [109 Cal.Rptr.2d 256].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-6\">The discretionary relief portion of section 473 reads, \u201cThe court may, upon any terms as may be just, relieve a party or his or her legal representative from a judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken against him or her through his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.\u201d  A party seeking relief under section 473 on the grounds of excusable neglect bears the burden of demonstrating that the neglect was excusable in order to secure relief. <em>(Cochran </em>v. <em>Linn </em>(1984) 159 Cal.App.3d 245, 252 [205 Cal.Rptr. 550].) The test of whether neglect was excusable is whether \u201c \u2018a reasonably prudent person under the same or similar circumstances\u2019 might have made the same error. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Bettencourt </em>v. <em>Los Rios Community College Dist. </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 270, 276 [228 Cal.Rptr. 190, 721 P.2d 71].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-7\">There is sufficient evidence to support the trial court\u2019s exercise of its discretion. Kaufman\u2019s declaration and conduct established that he was aware of the deadline for filing the oppositions and of his failure to file the oppositions to the defendants\u2019 two summary judgment motions in a timely manner. Kaufman allowed the deadline for filing the oppositions to pass, then sought and obtained a continuance of the hearings and an extension of time to complete the oppositions. But the trial court warned that in granting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1129\">*1129</page-number>the continuance and extension that there would not be any further continuances or extensions. Notwithstanding this warning, Kaufman failed to file the oppositions when they were due under the new briefing schedule. He did not even file any oppositions prior to the summary judgment hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-5\">Kaufman attributed the failure to file the oppositions to the \u201ccomplexity and intricacy\u201d of the arguments and medication-induced fatigue, without further detail of his medical condition and its purported effect on his performance in this case, and without explanation of his having allowed the filing deadlines to pass without seeking assistance from the court. That Kaufman was able to get to the courthouse, prepare papers and argue motions suggests that he was not so physically incapacitated that he could not file timely oppositions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-6\">Kaufman also failed to appear at the summary judgment hearing\u2014attributed by Luri to the overheating of her vehicle. While the automotive difficulty may have been inadvertent, it does not explain the failure to file the oppositions to the summary judgment motions, nor is there any explanation of the delay in filing the opposition papers\u2014declared by Kaufman to have been completed August 29, 2001\u2014until September 13, 2001. Even had Kaufman appeared at the hearing, without any written oppositions, the trial court was justified in proceeding on the basis of no opposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-7\">These facts are sufficient to support the trial court\u2019s conclusion that Luri had not established excusable neglect. <em>(Generale Bank Nederland </em>v. <em>Eyes of the Beholder Ltd. </em>(1998) 61 Cal.App.4th 1384, 1402 [72 Cal.Rptr.2d 188] [\u201cCounsel\u2019s failure to discharge routine professional duties is not excusable, nor is counsel\u2019s failure to properly prepare for the hearing the conduct of a reasonably prudent person\u201d]; <em>Transit Ads, Inc. </em>v. <em>Tanner Motor Livery, Ltd. </em>(1969) 270 Cal.App.2d 275, 286-288 [75 Cal.Rptr. 848] [attorney's declaration of illness without declaration of physician or details of illness does not establish excusable neglect]; <em>Willett v.

Co. </em>(1926) 80 Cal.App. 337, 339-340 [251 P. 932] [being \u201coverburdened with work\u201d is insufficient to constitute excusable neglect when attorney failed to file required papers in a timely manner]; 8 Witkin, Cal.
