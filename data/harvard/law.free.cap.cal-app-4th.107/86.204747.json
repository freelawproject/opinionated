The[y] . . . represent themselves as legitimate tenants\u2019 rights associations, legal consultants, professional legal assistants, paralegals, attorneys, or typing services. . . . The acts of these unscrupulous individuals ... are particularly despicable in that they target low-income and non-English-speaking Californians as victims for their fraudulent practices.\u201d (Stats. 1993, ch. 1011, \u00a7 1, pp. 5721-5722.)</p>\n<p id=\"b91-11\">Under names such as \u201cLegal Aid\u201d and \u201cLegal Aid Services\u201d defendant Walter Moore operates a business which purports to offer typing services, particularly in eviction cases. Victims of Moore\u2019s deception (Mark Brockey, Dawn Gayler, Fred Pavloff and Frank Word, collectively Brockey) were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>eventually directed to Legal Services of Northern California\u2019s Redding office and obtained representation in the underlying cases and in this action seeking monetary and injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">A jury found Moore practiced law in violation of the State Bar Act (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 6125, SBA), violated the UDAA and the Consumers Legal Remedies Act (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1750 et seq., CLRA) and awarded damages of $150 to each of the four plaintiffs. The jury found Moore acted with oppression and malice, but declined to award punitive damages. The trial court issued a judgment on the jury verdicts and a permanent injunction under the unfair competition law (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 17200 et seq., UCL), detailed below. Moore timely filed a notice of appeal. We shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">\u201cUnder the often-enunciated rule, which is so often forgotten in the enthusiasm of advocacy, we look to the evidence accepted by the [fact finder].\u201d <em>(Findleton </em>v. <em>Taylor </em>(1962) 208 Cal.App.2d 651, 652 [25 Cal.Rptr. 439]; see <em>Bartcroft-Whitney Co. v. McHugh </em>(1913) 166 Cal. 140, 142 [134 P. 1157].)</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">Plaintiffs lived in a mobilehome park in French Gulch, Shasta County, and in April 1998 they received unlawful detainer summonses they wanted to fight. None had the means to hire a lawyer and they tried to obtain free legal help.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">The Judicial Council form summons for unlawful detainer actions states the recipient has five days to file a response and \u201cIf you do not know an attorney, you may call an attorney referral service or a legal aid office <em>(listed in the phone book).\u201d </em>(Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b92-9\">The Judicial Council information sheet on waiver of court costs states \u201cIf you have any questions and cannot afford an attorney, you may wish to consult the legal aid office, legal services office, or lawyer referral service in your county (listed in the yellow pages under \u2018Attorneys\u2019).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b92-10\">Brockey (who lived with Gayler) looked in his local telephone directory under \u201cLegal Aid\u201d (as instructed on the Judicial Council form) and found a local number which he called. That number was forwarded to Moore\u2019s Modesto business. \u201cJay\u201d told Brockey he had to wire money, which Gayler did because she was able to drive to town to arrange the wire and faxes. Brockey did not tell \u201cJay\u201d which boxes to check, that he wanted each party to bear its own fees, or that he wanted to raise an affirmative defense by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>talking to the judge at the time of trial. Gayler thought they had contacted a law office \u201cthat offered services to low income people, [maybe] on a sliding scale of some sort.\u201d She called the number on the instructions to clarify them and Moore read the directions to her, rudely ignoring her inquiries. When they filed the papers, the court clerk directed them to the local Legal Services of Northern California (LSNC) office.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">Plaintiff Pavloff called \u201c411\u201d information to get the number for free \u201cLegal Aid Services,\u201d which he had used before, and was given Moore\u2019s number by the operator. He was told to wire $85, which he did. He did not tell \u201cJay\u201d how to fill out the forms. When he received them he was still unsure what to do so he went to his local LSNC office, and \u201cthat was the first time that I knew that this [meaning, Moore\u2019s business] wasn\u2019t the Legal Aid office that I thought it would be.\u201d Plaintiff Word testified to a similar series of events, thinking that \u201cLegal Aid\u201d was a government agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">The form answers Moore provided to the plaintiffs each have the general denial box checked and add the following purported affirmative defense; \u201cWill discuss with the judge at the time of trial.\u201d Each requests that \u201cboth [parties] pay their own legal fees.\u201d \u201cParties\u201d is spelled \u201cparteis\u201d on each form.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">The plaintiffs had to sign an \u201cagreement &amp; disclosure\u201d form for the \u201cLegal Aid Services Processing Center\u201d in Modesto after paying money but before receiving their answers. The form states that \u201c[t]his office is a professional document preparation and typing service only,\u201d that it is not a law office and \u201cwill not provide any legal advice.\u201d It suggests clients contact an attorney. The forms themselves show that they are sent after payment of money, as each reflects a zero account balance. For example, plaintiff Gayler\u2019s form states \u201cClient\u2019s deposit is $85.00 with a balance due of $0 for a total of $85.00.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b93-8\">Claudia Nakamura, not a plaintiff herein, testified to a similar set of facts occurring in April 1999. She faced an eviction in Salinas. She thought she was calling the entity which had helped her for free in the past, \u201cthe people that help people that don\u2019t have the money to pay a regular lawyer.\u201d When she asked why she was being charged she was told it was just for the paperwork. She did not see the agreement until after she paid. She did not tell the company how to fill out the form she later received. She was told to attach her own handwritten statement to the answer, but the business <em>did not offer to type it for her.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b93-9\">Donna Williams, not a plaintiff herein, also testified to a similar set of facts, except that she did not send money after her \u201clocal\u201d telephone call, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>instead went to the local LSNC office. She called \u201cLegal Aid\u201d \u201cBecause I\u2019ve always known Legal Aid to be someone\u2014somebody that helps people that are low income.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">Michele Logan, not a plaintiff herein, needed an annulment in December 1999, and called Moore\u2019s business, thinking it was \u201ca low income agency\u201d after finding the number under \u201cLegal Aid\u201d in the Modesto telephone directory. After she spent $200 and received the agreement form stating no legal advice was being provided, she felt she had no choice but to sign and return the agreement because it stated her documents were ready and \u201cthey cashed the check.\u201d When she tried to file the legal papers she was sent, the court clerk told her they were incomplete because she needed service paperwork. She called \u201cJeff\u2019 to complain and he offered to arrange for service by publication for her and said he was an attorney. Logan never received the promised additional paperwork.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">Velda Grotty, not a plaintiff herein, wanted help with a grandparent visitation issue and in June 1999 called a local \u201cLegal Aid\u201d number in her Redding telephone book. The man who answered listened to her problem and told her to complete some papers and send them back with $200, that it was a \u201cformality\u201d and in about 30 days it would be finished \u201cand I probably wouldn\u2019t even have to go to court.\u201d A couple of weeks later she received some forms and a statement that no legal services were provided and she called to inquire. A woman angrily told her that the company was only a typing service.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">Donna Pritchard, not a plaintiff herein, needed help with a bankruptcy and had used the real legal aid in the past. She found \u201cLegal Aid\u201d in the Redding telephone directory, called the local number and spoke with a woman who had answered the telephone \u201cLegal Aid.\u201d After paying $125, she received incorrect papers and ultimately got in touch with LSNC.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">Moore\u2019s former employee Michael Isaac testified he was told not to tell callers where the company was, to use aliases, and not to refer callers to the \u201creal\u201d legal aid. Isaac referred to Moore as \u201cJay\u201d at trial. When Isaac worked there in the fall of 1998, the company received from 60 to 200 calls per day. Isaac was a poor typist and was hired to answer the telephone.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-8\">Part of the deposition of Moore\u2019s former employee Cynthia Pimental was read to the jury. She worked for Moore from about December 1995 to April 1997. Employees were supposed to use aliases. Callers inquiring about free legal aid were to be told \u201cthis is Legal Aid but we do charge[.]\u201d They were to say they were \u201clocal\u201d or \u201cin the area\u201d but that the \u201cprocessing center\u201d was in Modesto. Moore called his employees \u201cplayers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b95-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>Stephen Goldberg, a lawyer for Northern California Lawyers for Civil Justice, a private nonprofit law firm, heard about Moore\u2019s business and contacted Moore\u2019s Web site in May 1998. He sent an e-mail claiming to be facing an eviction. The reply advised him to \u201ccall the Legal Aid Processing Center for document processing and assistance.\u201d Goldberg called the 800 number given and \u201cJay\u201d explained that \u201chis office was the local Legal Aid office mentioned on the [Judicial Council] summons.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">Cathy Farrell, the Redding office manager for LSNC, made an audiotape of the voice mail system messages she accessed by calling the \u201clocal\u201d number 241-6411 shortly before the trial. LSNC is a nonprofit corporation partly funded by the Legal Services Corporation and grants from government agencies, fundraisers and private charities. At one time the Redding office was called \u201cLegal Aid Society of Shasta County\u201d until it merged.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">For about seven years Melinda Brown has been the executive director of People of Progress, a Shasta County organization providing emergency food, clothing and informational referrals to the impoverished. It serves about 8,000 people per year. She has frequently heard LSNC referred to as \u201cLegal Aid,\u201d and LSNC is listed as \u201cLegal Aid\u201d on mailings which are sent monthly to food stamp recipients. In her opinion when low-income people refer to \u201cLegal Aid\u201d they mean LSNC or free legal services in general.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">After partly granting a request for judicial notice, discussed below, the trial court instructed the jury as follows: \u201cThe Judicial Council is the administrative body which [oversees] state courts in California. The Judicial Council issues forms that are used in legal proceedings. When a Judicial Council form refers to consulting an attorney and makes reference to Legal Aid or Legal Services, such as in a summons or the information sheet for waiver of court fees, . . . the reference is to a publicly funded nonprofit law corporation which provides free legal services to low income eligible clients.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b95-8\">Brockey called Moore as an adverse witness, and the jury (and trial court) did not believe Moore\u2019s version of events. We will not outline all of the discrepancies and vacillations.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-9\">Moore was the owner and manager of \u201cLegal Aid\u201d and \u201cLegal Aid Services\u201d and \u201cPremiere Marketing.\u201d He was not a lawyer or paralegal, but claimed to have an attorney (Ernest Elledge) \u201con staff,\u201d though he did not in 1998. If callers ask for legal advice, they are referred to Elledge. Moore\u2019s voice mail system directs callers to a 900 number for legal advice, but he claimed he received no income from this service.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>Moore used the alias \u201cJeff Simmons\u201d at Legal Aid. He uses the names \u201cLegal Aid Services\u201d and \u201cLegal Aid\u201d in marketing. He claimed he had a Modesto business license in the name of \u201cLegal Aid Services dash Legal Aid,\u201d but later in trial admitted he only had a license in the name of \u201cPremiere Marketing.\u201d Still later in trial he claimed he received a business license for Legal Aid and Legal Aid Services the Friday in the middle of trial. He had about 30 listings of \u201clocal\u201d numbers around California (e.g., Bakersfield, Los Angeles, Napa, Redding) which would forward calls to his Modesto business. He also used a toll free 800 number but claimed he used the local-forwarded numbers to save money (rather than to deceive callers into thinking they were calling a local legal aid office). He claimed his business typed what people directed on legal forms. Based on the information they provided, Moore would check the various boxes. The same is true for affirmative defenses, \u201cMisspelled words and all. We type their statement, their defense.\u201d He does not check the boxes relating to UDAA compliance because he considers himself to be an exempt typing service. However, he did not advertise his business as a \u201ctyping service\u201d in the yellow pages, but under \u201clegal clinics.\u201d He claimed this was up to the telephone company.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">Moore claimed his Web site (legalaidservices.com), which offered \u201clegal documents,\u201d would refer to people to lawyers. He claimed it was under construction and not operating, but conceded people could use it, and when people have done so he referred them to lawyers. Although it advertised \u201cSe habla espa\u00f1ol\u201d (under a scales of justice symbol) he no longer had any Spanish-speaking employees. Even though the Web site had a 1997 copyright notice, he claimed it was just under development and had not been operating that long. When confronted in the second week of trial with hard copies of a different version of the Web site, he said he had been working on it for months, but put it online the previous Saturday. He claimed its function was to link people with attorneys in different specialties. The Web site did not have any attorneys \u201csigned up at this point.\u201d However, it does list a 900 number.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">Among .the services offered on the Web site were \u201cbankruptcy\u201d services. Judge Whitney Rimel of the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of California, Fresno Division, issued an order in 1999, compelling \u201cLegal Aid Services\u201d to disgorge money to certain debtors and pay sanctions, which Legal Aid Services failed to do. This order also sanctioned Moore for failing to refrain from using the word \u201c \u2018legal\u2019 or any similar term in any advertisements\u201d pursuant to a federal statute regulating bankruptcy petition preparers. (See 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 110(f)(1).) Moore identified a bankruptcy court judgment he had agreed to recently before trial, finding he \u201c \u2018continued to prepare bankruptcy documents using the word \u201clegal\u201d in his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>business name and advertising\u2019 \u201d after the prior order. He claimed LSNC \u201ccalled the bankruptcy court and sic\u2019d <em>[sic, </em>sicced?] them on us[.]\u201d Moore admitted his voice on his company\u2019s voice mail system referred to doing bankruptcies, but he claimed the messages were old and the system was different now.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">Moore first claimed he had been using his business card since about 1994 or 1995, but when Brockey\u2019s counsel pointed out exhibit Q listed Moore\u2019s Web site, Moore claimed the card had been changed more recently.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">Moore denied requiring employees to use aliases. In deposition he could not remember the names of any employees in 1998, claiming he had \u201ca lot of volunteers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">Moore testified his business was not the \u201cLegal Aid\u201d or \u201cLegal Services\u201d office or \u201cLawyers Referral Service\u201d referred to in Judicial Council forms.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">Moore claimed when customers called, a price was agreed upon, the customers were faxed his written agreement, signed it, then the services were performed. He conceded the forms in evidence for the plaintiffs indicated payment had already been made, but denied that that meant money was collected before the agreement was sent or services provided. He did not save any documents relating to customers until \u201crecently,\u201d when Elledge advised him to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-9\">Moore testified he operated no other businesses, except that several years in the past he had used a business name of Certified Building Maintenance, or CBM. When recalled later in trial he testified he had no \u201cposition\u201d in .a company called Belmont Business Corporation, which operated out of the same Modesto building as his business. However, he later conceded he accepted rent checks on behalf of that company. He also testified \u201cBeckwith is kind of a service company that I do research with,\u201d but later conceded paychecks for his Legal Aid employees <em>currently </em>have the name Beckwith on them.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-10\">The jury was instructed on the following deemed admissions: Moore was not registered or bonded under the UDAA, Moore employed no attorneys, and no attorney was responsible for his work. In deposition he testified he destroyed all records, but \u201cwe\u2019ll start [keeping them] when we leave here [meaning, after the deposition is over.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b97-11\">After the jury began deliberating, the parties put on limited additional evidence regarding injunctive relief. In argument, Brockey predicated liability primarily on the UDAA and SBA (which were also before the jury), but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>also mentioned the UCL and CLRA; the court wanted to await the jury\u2019s verdicts to try to avoid inconsistent rulings.  We observe that it is generally proper for a trial court to await a jury\u2019s verdict before ruling on overlapping issues being tried to the court. (See, e.g., <em>Hughes </em>v. <em>Dunlap </em>(1891) 91 Cal. 385, 388-390 [27 P. 642]; <em>Posey v. Leavitt </em>(1991) 229 Cal.App.3d 1236, 1244 [280 Cal.Rptr. 568].)</p>\n<p id=\"AlG\">Moore was recalled and admitted he was not registered under the UDAA and had not posted the required bond. He claimed he sold \u201cLegal Aid\u201d to Attorney Elledge \u201cYesterday.\u201d He conceded it was an oral agreement \u201cat this point\u201d but was vague on details. He claimed Premiere Marketing \u201chas no relationship to Legal Aid\u201d and he was retaining that business. However, in his deposition Moore had stated he was the owner of \u201cLegal Aid Services\u201d and a marketing company called \u201cPremiere Marketing\u201d was the same thing.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">After the verdicts were returned the trial court announced it would issue an injunction because \u201cMoore has really preyed . . . on a vulnerable section of the population by leading people to believe he was Legal Aid, that he was Legal Services, the law service, the law office for the poor. He took advantage of that and had a scheme to continue that belief with people of limited income, dealing with a group of the population that was not likely to challenge his actions because of the relatively low dollar amount of the loss in each case, but dealing in a high volume with respect to the number of clients.\u201d The trial court did not specify which statutory violation or violations supported the injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">Then the parties briefed the scope of the injunction. Brockey sought an injunction based on <em>all </em>of the violations of law proven at the jury trial and court trial. The opposition asserted that Broclcey\u2019s failure to provide consumer survey evidence on the misleading nature, vel non, of the <em>advertisements </em>precluded injunctive relief. It also asserted Moore had transferred his business to Elledge, and that in any event the injunction was overbroad. Attached to the opposition was Elledge\u2019s declaration, claiming he had \u201cacquired the typing service known as LEGAL AID SERVICES\u2014LEGAL AID from Walter Moore of Modesto, CA.\u201d He then hedged and said \u201cI am in the process of exercising complete management and control\u201d of the business. In reply, Brockey emphasized that the trial evidence showed Moore\u2019s business practices were deceptive.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">Moore does not faithfully recite the facts supporting the verdict and the injunction in his briefs. Almost none of the above facts are mentioned.  Failure to set forth the material evidence on an issue waives a claim of insufficiency of the evidence. <em>(Foreman &amp; Clark Corp. v. Fallon </em>(1971) 3 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>Cal.3d 875, 881 [92 Cal.Rptr. 162, 479 P.2d 362].) Moreover, what facts are mentioned are skewed in Moore\u2019s favor. For example, Moore asserts that the agreement form disclosed that he offered typing services only and not legal services. However, Moore omits to state that this agreement form was sent to clients <em>after </em>they had paid the required fees for an unlawful detainer response, and that Moore and his employees, using aliases, routinely induced callers to send money for what was portrayed as legal assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">As another example, Moore asserts that the clients were provided with unlawful detainer answers, instructions to file the answers and the statement that further help or legal advice required consultation with an attorney. Moore omits mention of the evidence that he or his employees typed the answers without instructions from the clients, and the fact the responses chosen by them failed to raise any cognizable affirmative defenses. Thus, to the extent Moore implies by his brief that he faithfully provided the services set forth in the agreement (which, as stated above, did not truly reflect the bargain struck by the clients and Moore), the brief misleads.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">We deem all of Moore\u2019s evidentiary arguments waived. <em>(Foreman &amp; Clark Corp. v. Fallon, supra, </em>3 Cal.3d at p. 881.)</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-9\">The judgment recites that the jury found Moore practiced law without a license, violated the UDAA and the CLRA and acted with fraud, oppression or malice. The annexed injunction prohibits Moore in part from using the names \u201cLegal Aid Services\u201d or \u201cLegal Aid\u201d or \u201cLegal Services\u201d \u201cbecause these three names signify a non-profit law office providing free legal services to low-income persons and families\u201d; using the term \u201clegal\u201d except as a paralegal; and using \u201clocal\u201d telephone numbers which forward to his Modesto business. The injunction also requires Moore to change his Web site, tell customers he is not an attorney, place newspaper advertisements regarding this lawsuit and so forth.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-10\">The first argument heading in Moore\u2019s opening brief asserts \u201cThe evidence was insufficient as a matter of law to support the judgment for violations of the [UCL].\u201d He reiterates his claims in an argument about the denial of his directed verdict motion. Brockey replied by correctly pointing out there were several different unlawful practices proven which could support the UCL claim. In the reply brief Moore claims Brockey\u2019s brief is mostly irrelevant because Moore only attacked the <em>false advertising </em>theory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>under Business and Professions Code section 17500. Moore misperceives the import of Brockey\u2019s briefing.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">The UCL defines \u201cunfair competition\u201d as any \u201cunlawful, unfair or fraudulent business act or practice and unfair, deceptive, untrue or misleading advertising . . . .\u201d (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 17200.) It borrows standards of conduct from other statutes, and a plaintiff need only show the violation of any law. (See <em>Hewlett v. Squaw Valley Ski Corp. </em>(1997) 54 Cal.App.4th 499, 519 [63 Cal.Rptr.2d 118].) Another statute specifically makes unlawful advertising services by \u201cuntrue or misleading\u201d statements. (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 17500.) A violation of the false advertising law is a violation of the UCL. <em>(Committee on Children's Television, Inc. v. General Foods Corp. </em>(1983) 35 Cal.3d 197, 210 [197 Cal.Rptr. 783, 673 P.2d 660].)</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">Violation of the SBA, CLRA and UDAA, as found by the jury, <em>and not contested on appeal, </em>demonstrates that Moore has engaged in a prolonged pattern of unfair business practices, which supports the injunction as issued under the UCL. Part of the instructions on the UDAA theory based liability on the making of \u201cfalse or misleading statements\u201d (see Bus. &amp; Prof., \u00a7 6411, subd. (a)), and part of the instructions on the CLRA theory based liability on misrepresentation of the origin, source, affiliation and quality of services advertised (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1770, subd. (a)). Thus, the jury\u2019s findings of liability on those theories overlapped with the trial court\u2019s finding as to false advertising, regarding the use of \u201cLegal Aid\u201d and similar deceptive phrases by Moore. Therefore, we decline to address Moore\u2019s claims regarding false advertising under the UCL because even if we agreed with him the judgment issuing the injunction would be proper based on the unchallenged verdicts on the UDAA and CLRA theories. Wholly apart from advertising, the fact Moore was found by the jury to have given legal advice, rather than acting as a clerical typing service, could support an injunction preventing him from continuing to hold himself out as a source for \u201cLegal Aid\u201d or \u201cLegal Services\u201d and the like. (See <em>People v. Landlords Professional Services </em>(1989) 215 Cal.App.3d 1599, 1603-1604, 1608-1610 [264 Cal.Rptr. 548].)</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">In the reply brief Moore suggests that if he can eliminate the false advertising prong the case should be remanded for further proceedings, but he does not state what those proceedings would be. For.example, he does not point to any portion of the injunction which depends wholly on the false advertising claim, and we will not make such arguments for him. <em>(People v. Gidney </em>(1937) 10 Cal.2d 138, 142-143 [73 P.2d 1186].)</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">Moreover, Moore\u2019s attack on the misleading advertising prong is based on an unfair summary of the evidence, as stated above. Brockey had to show <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>Moore\u2019s business practice is such \u201cthat \u2018members of the public are likely to be deceived.\u2019\u201d <em>(Bank of the West </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 1254, 1266-1267 [10 Cal.Rptr.2d 538, 833 P.2d 545] <em>(Bank of the West).) </em>\u201cBy their breadth the statutes encompass not only those advertisements which have deceived or misled <em>because </em>they are untrue, but also those which may be accurate on some level, but will nonetheless tend to mislead or deceive. . . . A perfectly true statement couched in such a manner that it is likely to mislead or deceive the consumer, such as by failure to disclose other relevant information, is actionable under these sections.\u201d <em>(Day </em>v. <em>AT &amp; T Corp. </em>(1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 325, 332-333 [74 Cal.Rptr.2d 55].) Tellingly, a plaintiff need not prove that anybody was misled <em>(id. </em>at p. 332), although here people were misled.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">Moore contends Brockey had to prove \u201cvia extrinsic evidence\u201d that his misstatements would likely deceive a reasonable person (not merely a vulnerable person) and that what he terms \u201canecdotal\u201d evidence, that is, testimony by people that they were in fact misled, is insufficient. He fails to cite a single California case requiring use of survey evidence in unfair business practices cases, only lower federal court cases which are neither binding nor persuasive, to the extent they hold that direct evidence that many people were misled can never show that a reasonable consumer would likely be misled. (See, e.g., <em>Haskell </em>v. <em>Time, Inc. </em>(E.D.Cal. 1997). 965 F.Supp. 1398, 1407 [\u201cplaintiff must demonstrate by extrinsic evidence, such as consumer survey evidence, that the challenged statements tend to mislead consumers\u201d].) Generally, those cases involve a very few persons claiming to be misled and do not hold that \u201canecdotal\u201d evidence can <em>never </em>suffice. (See, e.g., <em>Churchill Village L.L.C </em>v. <em>General Electric Co. </em>(N.D.Cal. 2000) 169 F.Supp.2d 1119, 1131 [two of 300 recipients].) The Attorney General points out and Moore concedes that these cases have imported into the California UCL standards of proof derived from federal Lanham Act cases, where misleading, rather than false, statements must be shown to have deceived a \u201csignificant portion\u201d of the recipients. (See, e.g., <em>William H. Morris Co. v. Group W, Inc. </em>(9th Cir. 1995) 66 F.3d 255, relied on in part by <em>Haskell </em>and Churchill].) We are not persuaded that these cases accurately reflect California law.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">Even Moore acknowledges that while evidence of <em>actual </em>confusion <em>\u201cmay </em>be used as evidence of the likelihood of confusion to the general public, a few isolated examples are generally insufficient\u201d and the plaintiff in such cases must show \u201c \u2018a likelihood of confounding an appreciable number of reasonably prudent purchasers exercising ordinary care.\u2019 \u201d But here Brockey proved more than \u201cisolated examples\u201d of people who were actually misled. In this case a number of consumers were actually deceived, and from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>evidence about the enormity of Moore\u2019s business and the fact his employees were directed to lie to callers, the trier of fact could conclude Moore\u2019s activities were likely to mislead consumers. Further, Brockey had expert testimony that the impoverished in Shasta County equate \u201cLegal Aid\u201d with LSNC or a similar nonprofit law firm. From that fact, and the evidence of actual deception, the trier of fact could conclude deception was likely.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">Moreover, we agree with the Attorney General that \u201cthe primary evidence in a false advertising case is the advertising itself.\u201d The United States Supreme Court has rejected a claim that survey evidence was required in the analogous context of the Federal Trade Commission\u2019s regulation of deceptive advertising. <em>(FTC v. Colgate-Palmolive Co. </em>(1965) 380 U.S. 374, 391-392 [85 S.Ct. 1035, 1046, 13 L.Ed.2d 904, 918] [\u201cwhen the Commission finds deception it is also authorized, within the bounds of reason, to infer that the deception will constitute a material factor in a purchaser\u2019s decision to buy\u201d]; see <em>Resort Car Rental System, Inc. v. F. T. C. </em>(9th Cir. 1975) 518 F.2d 962, 964 [no need to consider objections to consumer testimony because it \u201cmerely supported the inferences which can logically be drawn by scrutinizing the advertising alone\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">In trade name disputes and cases construing California\u2019s prior unfair competition law (former Civ. Code, \u00a7 3369), the courts acknowledged that the \u201clikelihood of confusion\u201d between names was a factual question, but in some cases \u201cthe comparison of the two names themselves may be adequate to establish the likelihood of confusion.\u201d <em>(Ball v. American Trial Lawyers Assn. </em>(1971) 14 Cal.App.3d 289, 308-309 [92 Cal.Rptr. 228]; see <em>Hair v. McGuire </em>(1961) 188 Cal.App.2d 348, 353 [10 Cal.Rptr. 414] [if \u201ca person of ordinary intelligence could reasonably be deceived or confused, that is all that is required\u201d]; <em>Sun-Maid Raisin Growers v. Mosesian </em>(1927) 84 Cal.App. 485, 497 [258 P. 630].) In fraudulent misrepresentation cases, ignorant people are not denied recovery so long as they have acted reasonably within the limits of their knowledge; indeed, cheats search for easy marks. (See <em>Seeger v. Odell </em>(1941) 18 Cal.2d 409, 414-415 [115 P.2d 977, 136 A.L.R. 1291].) There is no indication the current version of the UCL was meant to depart from these rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">In our view, the way Moore words his telephone book listings is calculated to mislead and is likely to mislead consumers, as the jury (ruling on the SBA, UDAA and CLRA claims) and the trial court (ruling on false advertising claims) found.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">Moreover, where, as here, a statement is targeted at unsophisticated members of the public, it is appropriate to adjust the \u201creasonable consumer\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>standard accordingly. Moore targeted low-income people in need of \u201clegal services,\u201d a population that generally is less sophisticated than, say, readers of the San Francisco Daily Journal, a paper targeting lawyers and judges which also provides \u201clegal services\u201d advertisements. Moore relies on federal cases such as <em>Freeman </em>v. <em>Time, Inc. </em>(9th Cir. 1995) 68 F.3d 285, but that decision undermines his theory. <em>Freeman </em>involved a plaintiff who claimed he was misled by a typical sweepstakes notification into thinking he was a winner, although the notification stated an entrant had to return a \u201cwinning\u201d entry. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals adopted a rule that the plaintiff in such cases cannot rely on a showing that only some members of the public are likely to be deceived but must show a reasonable consumer must be deceived. But <em>Freeman </em>added a significant qualification: \u201c \u2018[Ujnless particularly gullible consumers are targeted, a reasonable person may expect others to behave reasonably as well.\u2019 [Citations.] In this case, the mailings were sent to millions of persons and there is no allegation that a particularly vulnerable group was targeted.\u201d (68 F.3d at p. 289.) The contrary is shown in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">At bottom the evidence shows Moore wanted to deceive the public and did deceive them. It is no great stretch\u2014indeed, no stretch at all\u2014to conclude he was <em>likely </em>to deceive them.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">II. <em>Judicial Notice of \u201cLegal Aid. \u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">Moore contends the trial court erroneously took judicial notice of the meaning of the term \u201cLegal Aid,\u201d claiming the trial court took it to mean \u201csynonymous with free legal services to low income persons.\u201d Brockey did ask the trial court to judicially notice this broad meaning of \u201cLegal Aid,\u201d but the trial court denied that motion. The trial court substantially narrowed the meaning it was willing to accept via judicial notice, and instructed the jury that the use of \u201cLegal Aid or Legal Services,\u201d <em>in Judicial Council forms </em>refers \u201cto a publicly funded nonprofit law corporation which provides free legal services to low income eligible clients.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">Moore contends the trial court abused its discretion because the meaning of \u201cLegal Aid\u201d was in dispute. Moore proffers three points of dispute about the meaning of \u201cLegal Aid,\u201d but none of these points, nor all three together, would help him in any way. The disputes are immaterial and therefore the trial court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-9\">First, Moore points out that there was testimony that LSNC was a <em>private </em>nonprofit corporation. But Moore\u2019s attorney elicited from Goldberg the fact that LSNC is \u201cpublic[ly] funded.\u201d Second, Moore points to testimony that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>some people confuse LSNC (which uses the term \u201cLegal Services\u201d) and \u201cLegal Aid.\u201d Third, Moore objects that only one of the nonparty witnesses testified that she thought \u201cLegal Aid\u201d referred to <em>free </em>services. Moore fails to explain how any or all of these disputes were material in the context of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">In his prejudice argument, Moore misstates the issue: \u201cThe trial court instructed the jury that it <em>\u2018must accept </em>and consider as evidence the judicially noticed fact that \u2018Legal Aid\u2019 means <em>free </em>legal services provided by a <em>public non-profit </em>corporation. [Citation.] In so doing, the trial court effectively denied Moore his right to a jury trial on a disputed, triable issue of fact.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">The trial court did <em>not </em>instruct the jury about the meaning of \u201cLegal Aid\u201d for all purposes, only its meaning as used on Judicial Council forms. Moore testified that he was <em>not </em>the \u201cLegal Aid\u201d referred to by the forms and therefore we fail to see how the instruction caused prejudice. So far as the meaning <em>of the forms </em>was concerned, the matter was not in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">We note that dictionaries and courts define \u201clegal aid\u201d to mean legal services for low-income people. (Black\u2019s Law Dict. (5th ed. 1979) p. 803, col. 2; Webster\u2019s 3d New Intenat. Dict. (1966) p. 1290, col. 2; <em>In re Brokenbrough </em>(Bankr. S.D. Ohio 1996) 197 B.R. 839 [\u201cLegal Aid Services\u201d confused people into thinking the for-profit business was the free local Legal Aid Society]; <em>American Legal Aid, Inc. v. Legal Aid Services, Inc. </em>(Wyo. 1972) 503 P.2d 1201, 1202.) And we find telling the fact that Attorney Elledge declared that he planned to make a change in the business: \u201cI have elected to eliminate the use of the name LEGAL AID, as that term is used in the Judicial Council forms and is generally associated with free legal assistance underwritten by sponsors of non-profit law corporations and professional offices.\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">III. <em>Breadth of the Injunction.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b104-8\">The UCL in part provides in part that where a person \u201chas engaged\u201d in unfair competition, \u201cThe court may make such orders . . . necessary to prevent the use ... of any practice which constitutes unfair competition . . . or as may be necessary to restore to any person in interest any money or property, real or personal, which may have been acquired by means of such unfair competition.\u201d (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 17203.) We have previously recognized that this provision allows trial courts great latitude in protecting the public and making the victims of unfair competition whole. <em>(Hewlett </em>v. <em>Squaw Valley Ski Corp., supra, </em>54 Cal.App.4th at pp. 539-540; see <em>Cortez v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number><em>Purolator Air Filtration Products Co. </em>(2000) 23 Cal.4th 163, 180 [96 Cal.Rptr.2d 518, 999 P.2d 706]; <em>Bank of the West, supra, </em>2 Cal.4th at p. 1267.)</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">Moore attacks the injunction on several meritless grounds. He acknowledges the abuse of discretion standard <em>(California Service Station etc. Assn. v. Union Oil Co. </em>(1991) 232 Cal.App.3d 44, 56-57 [283 Cal.Rptr. 279]), but simply disagrees with the trial court\u2019s findings. We agree with Moore that an injunction must seek to prevent harm, not to punish the wrongdoer.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">First, Moore states that he presented evidence he had transferred his business to a licensed attorney. However, the trial court was free to disbelieve that evidence. Moore\u2019s evidence on this point was that during trial in this matter he sold his interest to Attorney Elledge, but this was pursuant to an uncompleted oral agreement \u201cat this point.\u201d The trial court stated this transaction \u201ccould be a sham\u201d or \u201cdodge.\u201d Even Elledge\u2019s declaration submitted in opposition to the injunction states he is \u201cin the process\u201d of acquiring the business. Elledge had some sort of preexisting employment relationship with Moore. The trial court was not obliged to accept that the transaction was genuine. Moreover, a trial court may issue an injunction where a person has committed a <em>past </em>unlawful practice. (See <em>Stop Youth Addiction, Inc. </em>v. <em>Lucky Stores, Inc. </em>(1998) 17 Cal.4th 553, 570 [71 Cal.Rptr.2d 731, 950 P.2d 1086].)</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">The rest of the many claims raised suggest alternatives the trial court might have found to be effective, but this does not show the trial court abused its discretion. Moore also asserts, without significant amplification, that various provisions are \u201cpunitive.\u201d We will briefly address each of the points raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">Moore suggests the trial court could have allowed him to use \u201cLegal Aid\u201d and similar names, provided he included a disclaimer when prospective clients called, to the effect that he was not <em>the </em>\u201cLegal Aid.\u201d Such a provision would authorize the use of misleading statements in violation of the law, as the Attorney General points out. It would also be difficult, if not impossible, to monitor. How this would protect the public is not explained in Moore\u2019s brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-9\">In related claims Moore asserts the injunction is overbroad because it bars him from using \u201cLegal Services\u201d and \u201cLegal Aid Services,\u201d and he claims these.terms were not litigated. In fact, \u201cLegal Services\u201d appears on one of the Judicial Council forms which Moore testified did <em>not </em>refer to his business. \u201cLegal Aid Services\u201d also appears in the trial record, for example, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>in trial exhibit M, Brockey\u2019s demand letter (required by the CLRA, see Civ. Code, \u00a7 1782) to Moore. In our view, the trial court could conclude \u201cLegal Aid Services\u201d carried the same likelihood of confusion as \u201cLegal Aid\u201d or \u201cLegal Services.\u201d Moore similarly complains that the prohibition on any use of the term \u201clegal\u201d and symbols of scales of justice are \u201cpunitive.\u201d He did not object to the prohibition on the use of scales in the trial court. Given the evidence of Moore\u2019s repeated and intentional efforts to mislead people into thinking he was a lawyer, the trial court could reasonably conclude these provisions were necessary to prevent further acts of consumer fraud. The record also shows that Judge Rimel fined Moore for using the term \u201clegal\u201d in violation of federal law and the record shows Moore continued to violate her orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">Moore contends the provision requiring him to provide copies of the injunctions to any employees of any of his businesses is punitive because he might choose to open up a business which could not possibly be confused with legal services, e.g., a dry cleaning business. However, there was testimony Moore operated under various names and his evasions on this point no doubt convinced the trial court that this provision was necessary to deter him from opening a business akin to those he had been operating. If, indeed, Moore wishes to open a dry cleaning business, it is difficult to see how he can be harmed by giving his employees copies of this injunction. It would only deter employees of a business that might be covered by the injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">Moore complains that he must make compliance reports to Brockey\u2019s counsel. He offers no other monitor or method of ensuring compliance and the Attorney General cites other cases in which defendants were ordered to report on compliance. The trial court could conclude Moore was otherwise unlikely to comply with the injunction given his violations of state laws and Judge RimeTs orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">Moore complains about the requirement that he advertise the injunction in various newspapers (in the communities where he operated the call-forwarded numbers in the yellow pages), and report to Brockey\u2019s counsel the names of all persons who responded to the advertisements. Again, this is not a punitive condition, as Moore baldly asserts; it is a necessary mechanism to achieve full disgorgement of Moore\u2019s wrongful profits. (See <em>Kraus v. Trinity Management Services, Inc. </em>(2000) 23 Cal.4th 116, 138 &amp; fn. 18 [96 Cal.Rptr.2d 485, 999 P.2d 718].) Isaac testified the company received 60 to 200 calls per day and the trial court thought there might be \u201cthousands\u201d of victims to be located. Moore offers no alternative effective method. Because Moore destroyed business records, there does not seem to be any other practical way to find out the names of his other victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>Moore does offer a narrower claim: Because the injunction requires his compliance advertisements to tell interested persons to contact LSNC, he complains the requirement that he also notify LSNC of respondents to the advertisement is duplicative. However, the trial court could conclude some defrauded consumers might contact Moore directly instead of LSNC, and the requirement that he report all names responding ensures LSNC will be able to contact such persons as necessary. Moore\u2019s claim that quarter-page advertisements are unduly large and expensive does not show an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">Sims, Acting P. J., and Davis, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
