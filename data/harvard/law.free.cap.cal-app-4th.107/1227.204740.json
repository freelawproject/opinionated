Groves of two counts each of forcible oral copulation, kidnapping and carjacking, all committed in 1999. (See Pen. Code,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u00a7\u00a7 207, subd. (a), 215, subd. (a); see also former \u00a7 288a, subd. (c)(2), as amended by Stats. 1998, ch. 936, \u00a7 5.) He appealed his conviction and his initial sentence of 59 years to life<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in state prison. We affirmed the underlying conviction, but reversed a sentence of 25 years to life and remanded for resentencing. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Groves </em>(Oct. 26, 2001, A090570) [nonpub. opn].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-7\">In March 2002, Groves was resentenced to a total term of 42 years to life<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in state prison.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He received an indeterminate term of 25 years to life for one count of oral copulation. (See \u00a7\u00a7 667.61, subd. (d)(2).) He was also sentenced to serve a 17-year determinate term\u2014a consecutive eight-year aggravated term for the second count of oral copulation and a consecutive upper term of nine years for carjacking. Sentences for other offenses were stayed to avoid multiple punishment. (See \u00a7 654.) In his appeal after resentencing, Groves now contends that (1) the trial court erred by finding that the two counts of oral copulation occurred on separate occasions; (2) imposition of a full term consecutive term for the second count of oral copulation violated his federal constitutional due process and jury trial rights because it was imposed without a jury finding based on a burden of proof less than proof beyond a reasonable doubt; and (3) his sentence constitutes cruel and/or unusual punishment. We affirm the judgment, including the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1230\">*1230</page-number>I. Consecutive Terms<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1104-4\">II. Jury Trial and Due Process</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-5\">By statute, the trial court at sentencing is empowered to make the determination whether multiple sexual offenses occurred on separate occasions for purposes of imposing full consecutive terms. (See \u00a7 667.6, subd. (d); Cal. Rules of Court, rule 4.426(a)(2).) These findings are typically based on burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Levitt </em>(1984) 156 Cal.App.3d 500, 515 [203 Cal.Rptr. 276] [circumstances in aggravation].)  In this case, the trial court found that both oral copulations occurred on separate occasions, warranting the imposition of a full term for the second offense to be served consecutive to the term of 25 years to life imposed for the first offense. In his next challenge, Groves argues that the imposition of these two consecutive terms without a jury finding that the . offenses occurred on separate occasions violated his federal constitutional rights to a jury trial and to due process.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (See U.S. Const., 6th &amp; 14th Amends.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-6\">Groves first claims that he had a due process right to have the separate occasions determination made by proof beyond a reasonable doubt. (See U.S. Const., 14th Amend.)  A criminal defendant has a federal constitutional due process right to have every fact necessary to <em>conviction </em>proven by proof beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>(McMillan </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania </em>(1986) 477 U.S. 79, 84-85 [106 S.Ct. 2411, 2415-2416, 91 L.Ed.2d 67]; <em>In re Winship </em>(1970) 397 U.S. 358, 364 [90 S.Ct. 1068, 1072-1073, 25 L.Ed.2d 368].) However, the United States Supreme Court has held that in a <em>sentencing </em>context, the state may link the severity of punishment to the presence or absence of a factor that the prosecution need not prove by proof beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>(McMillan </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania, supra, 477 </em>U.S. at p. 84 [106 S.Ct. at p. 2415]; <em>Patterson v. New York </em>(1977) 432 U.S. 197, 214 [97 S.Ct. 2319, 2329, 53 L.Ed.2d 281].) If the specific fact<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> at issue is not an element of the crime but is a factor that comes into play only after the defendant had been found guilty of the charges beyond a reasonable doubt and no increase in sentence beyond the statutory maximum for the offense established by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1231\">*1231</page-number>jury is implicated, then the state may consider this factor based on a lesser standard of proof. <em>(Apprendi </em>v. <em>New Jersey, supra, </em>530 U.S. at p. 487 [120 S.Ct. at p. 2361]; <em>McMillan </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania, supra, </em>477 U.S. at pp. 85-86 [106 S.Ct. at pp. 2415-2416].) The facts setting the maximum term of a sentence and the trial court\u2019s power to impose that sentence are not elements of the crime for purposes of federal constitutional law. Within the range of sentence authorized by the jury\u2019s verdict, a trial court may exercise its discretion and expertise to impose a sentence. (See <em>Harris v. United States </em>(2002) 536 U.S. 545, 549-550, 566-567 [122 S.Ct. 2406, 2410, 2419, 153 L.Ed.2d 524].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-5\">In this case, the specific fact\u2014whether multiple offenses against the same victim occurred on separate occasions, based on a finding of whether Groves had a reasonable opportunity to reflect on his actions after the first offense but nevertheless chose to resume his sexually assaultive behavior\u2014is not an element of either oral copulation offense. (See former \u00a7 288a, subd. (c)(2).) Logically, this factor cannot come into play until the defendant has already been convicted of multiple separate offenses. (See \u00a7 667.6, subd. (d).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-6\">Likewise, the statutory maximum term for forcible oral copulation is the full consecutive term that was imposed in this case for Groves\u2019s second conviction of oral copulation. The determinate sentencing law provides that consecutive terms are typically calculated at one-third the middle base term. (See former \u00a7 1170.1, subd. (a), as amended by Stats. 1998, ch. 926, \u00a7 2.5.) A trial court <em>may </em>impose a full consecutive term for a second sexual assault offense, even if both offenses were committed during a single transaction. In such a situation, the trial court must offer a statement of reasons in support of its discretionary sentencing choice. (See \u00a7 667.6, subd. (c); Cal. Rules of Court, rule 4.406(b)(6).) If the trial court finds that both offenses were committed on separate occasions as the court did in Groves\u2019s case, the trial court <em>must </em>impose the full consecutive term for the second offense. (See \u00a7 667.6, subd. (d).) The mandatory imposition of this maximum possible sentence does not constitute an increase in the maximum possible sentence. Thus, we find that federal constitutional due process principles do not require that this finding be made by proof beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-7\">Groves also asserts that he had a federal constitutional right to have a jury\u2014rather than the trial court\u2014determine this issue. (See U.S. Const., 6th Amend.) If due process requires a sentencing factor to be established by a burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt, then the issue must be submitted to a jury. (See <em>Apprendi </em>v. <em>New Jersey, supra, </em>530 U.S. at p. 490 [120 S.Ct. at pp. 2362-2363]; see also <em>Harris </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>536 U.S. at p. 549-550 [122 S.Ct. at p. 2410].) However, as we have concluded that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1232\">*1232</page-number>reasonable doubt standard is not implicated in this case, neither does this sentence factor require a jury\u2019s input. In this case, the trial court properly made the finding it did by a preponderance of evidence and without submitting the issue to a jury. Thus, the full consecutive sentence for Groves\u2019s second offense of oral copulation was consistent with federal constitutional standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-4\">III.
