J.</author>\n<p id=\"AqG\">Defendant R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company (Reynolds) appeals a summary judgment favoring plaintiff the People of the State of California on the People\u2019s complaint for enforcement of a master settlement agreement (MSA). Reynolds contends the court erred in concluding Reynolds violated an MSA provision limiting outdoor advertising of tobacco <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>products. Since Reynolds has not demonstrated reversible error, the summary judgment must be upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">Introduction</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">We review the summary judgment de novo. <em>(Sambrano </em>v. <em>City of San Diego </em>(2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 225, 235 [114 Cal.Rptr.2d 151].)  Further, the \u201cinterpretation of a contract is subject to de novo review where the interpretation does not turn on the credibility of extrinsic evidence.\u201d <em>(Morgan </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles Bd. of Pension Comrs. </em>(2000) 85 Cal.App.4th 836, 843 [102 Cal.Rptr.2d 468]; <em>Centex Golden Construction Co. v.

Events comprising a portion of the Reynolds-sponsored NASCAR Winston Cup Series were held at the Sears Point Raceway (Sears Point) in Northern California.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">In November 1998 Reynolds and the People signed the MSA that settled the People\u2019s litigation against various tobacco product manufacturers, including Reynolds.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Further, the parties stipulated to entry of a consent decree and final judgment. As part of the consent decree, the Superior Court of San Diego County approved the MSA <em>(People v. Philip Morris, Inc. </em>(1998, No. JCCP4041)). The court also retained exclusive jurisdiction for purposes of implementing and enforcing the MSA.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-9\">The MSA placed various detailed express restrictions on Reynolds\u2019s advertising and marketing practices. However, despite generally banning all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>billboard and other outdoor advertising of tobacco products, the MSA expressly permitted Reynolds to continue to promote and advertise its NASCAR Winston Cup Series as a \u201cBrand Name Sponsorship.\u201d Eventually, a dispute arose between the parties about whether by not removing some outdoor advertising signs mentioning Winston at Sears Point, Reynolds violated the MSA\u2019s limitation on outdoor advertising.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">In March 2001 after communications between the parties failed to resolve the matter, the People brought this litigation against Reynolds to enforce the MSA and obtain relief for Reynolds\u2019s alleged violation of the MSA\u2019s restrictions on outdoor advertising. Ultimately, the superior court granted the People\u2019s motion for summary judgment against Reynolds.

However, the People contend Reynolds violated the MSA\u2019s provisions involving the length of time that Reynolds\u2019s advertising signage was allowed to be posted at Sears Point. In particular, the parties dispute the meaning of the phrase \u201cinitial sponsored event\u201d as used in the MSA\u2019s subsection 111(c)(2)(A) and later in the MSA\u2019s subsection III(c)(3)(E)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-9\">Specifically, Reynolds contends that since the phrase \u201cinitial sponsored event\u201d in the MSA\u2019s subsection III(c)(2)(A) undisputedly referred to the first event in Reynolds\u2019s Brand Name Sponsorship series in a 12-month period, the phrase \u201cinitial sponsored event\u201d in the MSA\u2019s subsection III(c)(3)(E)(ii) should be interpreted as conveying the same meaning, to wit, that Reynolds\u2019s outdoor advertising could be placed at any site where a Brand Name Sponsorship event took place as long as such advertising was placed no more than 90 days before the first event in the Brand Name Sponsorship series as a whole and was removed no later than 10 days after the last event in the entire series. Thus, applying its proffered interpretation, Reynolds concludes the protracted schedule of the NASCAR Winston Cup Series from February to November allowed for uninterrupted signage at Sears Point.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-10\">However, though concurring in Reynolds\u2019s interpretation of the meaning of the phrase \u201cinitial sponsored event\u201d as used in the MSA\u2019s subsection III(c)(2)(A), the People contend the phrase \u201cinitial sponsored event\u201d as used in the MSA\u2019s subsection III(c)(3)(E)(ii) referred to the first event at each particular racetrack where a portion of the Brand Name Sponsorship series <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>took place. Hence, applying their proffered interpretation, the People conclude Reynolds\u2019s outdoor advertising at each of those particular sites was temporally limited to the period between 90 days before and 10 days after the events at each such respective site.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">In sum, Reynolds contends the text of the MSA\u2019s subsection III(c)(3)(E)(ii) indicated that the phrases \u201cinitial sponsored event\u201d and \u201clast sponsored event\u201d referred to the first and last events of Reynolds\u2019s Brand Name Sponsorship series as a whole, while the People contend those phrases referred to the first and last days of events at particular races sites. Analyzing the disputed portions of the MSA under established principles of contract interpretation, we conclude the People\u2019s interpretation of the meaning of the phrase \u201cinitial sponsored event\u201d in the MSA\u2019s subsection III(c)(3)(E)(ii) is correct. However, in reaching our conclusion, we decline to apply the People\u2019s proffered analysis based on the theory that the overall general intent of the MSA was to reduce youth smoking and promote public health. Though the parties\u2019 pleadings acknowledged that the MSA\u2019s stated goals included reduction of youth smoking and promotion of public health, the MSA was fundamentally a means of settling litigation by striking a balance between competing interests. As such, the parties expressly agreed that although some outdoor advertising by Reynolds would be prohibited, some would nevertheless be allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">\n<em>Legal Standards for Interpreting the MSA</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">\u201c \u2018When a dispute arises over the meaning of contract language, the first question to be decided is whether the language is \u201creasonably susceptible\u201d to the interpretation urged by the party. If it is not, the case is over. [Citation.] If the court decides the language is reasonably susceptible to the interpretation urged, the court moves to the second question: what did the parties intend the language to mean?\u2019 \u201d <em>(Oceanside 84, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Fidelity Federal Bank </em>(1997) 56 Cal.App.4th 1441, 1448 [66 Cal.Rptr.2d 487].) \u201cIn interpreting an unambiguous contractual provision we are bound to give effect to the plain and ordinary meaning of the language used by the parties.\u201d <em>(Coast Plaza Doctors Hospital v. Blue Cross of California </em>(2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 677, 684 [99 Cal.Rptr.2d 809].) Thus, where \u201c \u2018contract language is clear and explicit and does not lead to absurd results, we ascertain intent from the written terms and go no further.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Shaw v. Regents of University of California </em>(1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 44, 53 [67 Cal.Rptr.2d 850].) \u201cIf the contract is capable of more than one reasonable interpretation, it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>ambiguous [citations], and it is the court\u2019s task to determine the ultimate construction to be placed on the ambiguous language by applying the standard rules of interpretation in order to give effect to the mutual intention of the parties [citation].\u201d <em>(Badie v. Bank of America </em>(1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 779, 798 [79 Cal.Rptr.2d 273].) However, the \u201cmere fact that a word or phrase in a [contract] may have multiple meanings does not create an ambiguity.\u201d <em>(Palmer v. Truck Ins. Exchange </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 1109, 1118 [90 Cal.Rptr.2d 647, 988 P.2d 568] (Palmer).)</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">\u201cThe goal of contractual interpretation is to determine and give effect to the mutual intention of the parties.\u201d <em>(Safeco Ins. Co. v. Robert S. </em>(2001) 26 Cal.4th 758, 763 [110 Cal.Rptr.2d 844, 28 P.3d 889]; <em>Bank of the West </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 1254, 1264 [10 Cal.Rptr.2d 538, 833 P.2d 545].) Thus, a \u201ccourt\u2019s paramount consideration in construing [a] stipulation is the parties\u2019 objective intent when they entered into it.\u201d <em>(Sy First Family Ltd. Partnership </em>v. <em>Cheung </em>(1999) 70 Cal.App.4th 1334, 1341 [83 Cal.Rptr.2d 340]; accord, <em>Pardee Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Insurance Co. of the West </em>(2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1340, 1352 [92 Cal.Rptr.2d 443]; <em>Southern Pacific Transportation Co. v. Santa Fe Pacific Pipelines, Inc. </em>(1999) 74 Cal.App.4th 1232, 1240 [88 Cal.Rptr.2d 777].) \u201cThat intent is to be inferred, if possible, solely from the written provisions of the contract.\u201d <em>(Pardee, </em>at p. 1352.) \u201c \u2018All the rules of interpretation must be considered and each given its proper weight, where necessary, in order to arrive at the true effect of the instrument. \u2019 \u201d <em>(City of Manhattan Beach </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1996) 13 Cal.4th 232, 238 [52 Cal.Rptr.2d 82, 914 P.2d 160].) \u201cGenerally speaking, \u2018the rules of interpretation of written contracts are for the purpose of ascertaining the meaning of the <em>words used </em>therein . . . .\u2019\u201d <em>(Miscione v. Barton Development. Co. </em>(1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 1320, 1326 [61 Cal.Rptr.2d 280].)</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">Thus, \u201c[a] contract must be so interpreted as to give effect to the mutual intention of the parties as it existed at the time of contracting, so far as the same is ascertainable and lawful.\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1636.)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> \u201cThe language of a contract is to govern its interpretation, if the language is clear and explicit, and does not involve an absurdity.\u201d (\u00a7 1638.) \u201cWhen a contract is reduced to writing, the intention of the parties is to be ascertained from the writing alone, if possible . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 1639.) \u201cThe whole of a contract is to be taken together, so as to give effect to every part, if reasonably practicable, each clause helping to interpret the other.\u201d (\u00a7 1641.) \u201cA contract must receive such an interpretation as will make it lawful, operative, definite, reasonable, and capable of being carried into effect, if it can be done without violating the intention of the parties.\u201d (\u00a7 1643.) \u201cThe words of a contract are to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>understood in their ordinary and popular sense, rather than according to their strict legal meaning; unless used by the parties in a technical sense, or unless a special meaning is given to them by usage, in which case the latter must be followed.\u201d (\u00a7 1644.)</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">In sum, courts must give a \u201c \u2018reasonable and commonsense interpretation\u2019 \u201d of a contract consistent with the parties\u2019 apparent intent. (Cf. <em>Renee J. v. Superior Court </em>(2001) 26 Cal.4th 735, 744 [110 Cal.Rptr.2d 828, 28 P.3d 876] <em>(Renee J.).) </em>The language \u201c \u2018 \u201cin a contract must be construed in the context of that instrument as a whole.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Palmer, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th at p. 1118.) Further, if possible, the court should give effect to every provision of the contract. <em>(National City Police Officers' Assn. v. City of National City </em>(2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 1274, 1279 [105 Cal.Rptr.2d 237] <em>(National City).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">\n<em>Same Meaning Rule</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">Seeking reversal of the summary judgment, Reynolds contends the phrase \u201cinitial sponsored event\u201d used in the MSA\u2019s subsections III(c)(2)(A) and III(c)(3)(E)(ii) must be interpreted under the \u201csame meaning rule,\u201d a rule of contract interpretation requiring that an identical phrase or word used in a contract be given the same meaning throughout the contract in the absence of any anything in the contract suggesting otherwise. <em>(Palmer, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th at pp. 1116-1117; <em>Victoria </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1985) 40 Cal.3d 734, 741 [222 Cal.Rptr. 1, 710 P.2d 833]; <em>Caminetti </em>v. <em>Pac.

Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co. </em>(1986) 184 Cal.App.3d 1479, 1486 [237 Cal.Rptr. 473] [\u201cwords used in a certain sense in one part of a contract are deemed to have been used in the same sense elsewhere in that instrument\u201d].) Specifically, Reynolds characterizes the phrase \u201cinitial sponsored event\u201d in the MSA\u2019s subsection III(c)(2)(A) as an \u201carbitrary combination of words with a fixed meaning\u201d that clarified a \u201ctime restriction\u201d on Brand Name Sponsorships by limiting any Brand Name Sponsorship to a 12-month period measured from the first event in the Brand Name Sponsorship series as a whole. Attaching the same meaning to the phrase \u201cinitial sponsored event\u201d as used later in the MSA\u2019s subsection III(c)(3)(E)(ii), Reynolds concludes the time restriction imposed by that subsection should also be interpreted as measured from the first event of the Brand Name Sponsorship as a whole. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>However, when reasonably read in context, the phrase \u201cinitial sponsored event\u201d had different meanings in those two disputed MSA subsections. (\u00a7 1641; cf. <em>Palmer, </em>at p. 1118.)</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">We agree with Reynolds that when considered in context, the phrase \u201cinitial sponsored event\u201d as used in the MSA\u2019s subsection III(c)(2)(A) referred to the first event of Reynolds\u2019s Brand Name Sponsorship series as a whole in limiting Reynolds to a single Brand Name Sponsorship in any 12-month period measured from the date of the initial sponsored event in the series. However, we reject Reynolds\u2019s contention that there was no difference in context between the MSA\u2019s two uses of the phrase \u201cinitial sponsored event\u201d sufficient to overcome the presumption such phrase had the same meaning in the two disputed MSA subsections. Instead, a reasonable reading of those two subsections in context indicates the same meaning rule should not apply here. <em>(Palmer, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th at p. 1116; \u00a7 1641.) The MSA contained no express definition of the phrase \u201cinitial sponsored event.\u201d The phrase \u201cinitial sponsored event\u201d was simply a series of words to be interpreted in light of the context where they were used. Thus, in a parenthetical clause in the MSA\u2019s subsection III(c)(2)(A), the phrase \u201cinitial sponsored event\u201d was used to identify the date constituting the beginning of the 12-month period when Reynolds could not engage in more that one Brand Name Sponsorship. The MSA\u2019s subsection 111(c)(2)(A) did not purport to define the term \u201cevent\u201d or make any reference to the location of any such event.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">In contrast to the MSA\u2019s subsection III(c)(2)(A), the language of the MSA\u2019s subsection III(c)(3)(E)(ii) expressly referred to the location of the \u201cinitial sponsored event.\u201d Specifically, as used in the MSA\u2019s subsection III(c)(3)(E)(ii), the phrase \u201cinitial sponsored event\u201d appeared in the context of limiting the period of time when Reynolds\u2019s outdoor advertising could be placed \u201cat the site\u201d of a Brand Name Sponsorship. The term \u201cthe site\u201d in the MSA\u2019s subsection III(c)(3)(E)(ii) conveyed the plain meaning of one particular location, not multiple locations. (\u00a7\u00a7 1638, 1644.) Further, each event in the Brand Name Sponsorship series occurred at a particular racetrack at a distinct time. As such, no individual racetrack constituted \u201cthe site\u201d of the sponsored series as a whole. Thus, reasonably read, the phrase \u201cinitial sponsored event\u201d as used in the MSA\u2019s subsection 111(c)(3)(E)(ii) referred to the first event at each particular racetrack where a portion of the 12-month Brand Name Sponsorship series took place in limiting Reynolds\u2019s placement of advertising at each respective racetrack to a period beginning 90 days before the initial sponsored event at that racetrack and ending 10 days after the last sponsored event at that racetrack. Further, when the two disputed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>MSA subsections are reasonably read in context, there is no conflict between the two meanings of the phrase \u201cinitial sponsored event.\u201d Manifestly, on the one occasion that the first event at a particular site is also the first event in the 12-month Brand Name Sponsorship series as whole, the phrase \u201cinitial sponsored event\u201d reasonably conveys both meanings with respect to that one event.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">In interpreting the meaning of the phrase \u201cinitial sponsored event\u201d used in the MSA\u2019s subsection III(c)(3)(E)(ii) as site-specific, we reject Reynolds\u2019s contention that the phrase \u201cat the site of a Brand Name Sponsorship\u201d used in that subsection referred only to the location where the outdoor advertising could be placed and had no effect on the subsection\u2019s assertedly \u201cindependent\u201d temporal requirement. More particularly, citing the language of the MSA\u2019s subsection III(c)(3)(D), Reynolds contends that if the MSA\u2019s drafters had intended to make the temporal restriction in the MSA\u2019s subsection III(c)(3)(E)(ii) site-specific, they could have done so.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> However, the MSA\u2019s subsection III(c)(3)(D)(ii)\u2019s parenthetical phrase \u201cduring such event\u201d is itself open to interpretation. Although Reynolds characterizes the temporal restriction of the MSA\u2019s subsection III(c)(3)(D)(ii) as \u201climited to the duration of a single event,\u201d nothing in such subsection or elsewhere in the MSA defined the term \u201cevent.\u201d Thus, to the extent Reynolds contends the word \u201cevent\u201d in the MSA\u2019s subsection III(c)(3)(E)(ii) referred to the Brand Name Sponsorship series itself, the word \u201cevent\u201d in subsection III(c)(3)(D)(ii) could also refer to the Brand Name Sponsorship itself. However, since the term \u201c \u2018Brand Name Sponsorship\u2019 \u201d as defined by the MSA\u2019s subsection II(j) was not solely in the singular, Brand Name Sponsorship did not necessarily mean only one \u201cevent\u201d but instead, as Reynolds acknowledges, expressly included \u201cone or more events within a single national or multi-state series or tour.\u201d Hence, if the MSA\u2019s subsection III(c)(3)(E)(ii) had been meant to convey the non-site-specific interpretation proffered by Reynolds, the drafters would have used the term \u201cBrand Name Sponsorship\u201d in that subsection in place of the phrases \u201cinitial sponsored event\u201d and \u201clast sponsored event.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>Interpretation of the phrase \u201cinitial sponsored event\u201d in the MSA\u2019s subsection III(c)(3)(E)(ii) as site-specific is consistent with a reasonable and commonsense application of the rules of contract interpretation congruent with the parties\u2019 apparent intent. (Cf. <em>Renee J., supra, </em>26 Cal.3d at p. 744.) Considered in context, the temporal restriction set forth in the MSA\u2019s subsection III(c)(3)(E)(ii) was meant to permit Reynolds to place outdoor advertising signs to alert race fans to Brand Name Sponsorship series events that were scheduled or ongoing at various individual racetracks at various times as well as to afford Reynolds a reasonable period of time to remove those signs. Thus, by allowing Reynolds to give race fans ample notice of its sponsorship of an upcoming/ongoing event at a particular racetrack and to remove the signs after the last event at such racetrack, the People\u2019s proffered site-specific interpretation of the MSA\u2019s subsection III(c)(3)(E)(ii) gave effect to each provision of that subsection in the context of the MSA as a whole. (\u00a7 1641; <em>Palmer, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th at p. 1118; <em>National City, supra, </em>87 Cal.App.4th at p. 1279.) In sum, since when reasonably interpreted the phrase \u201cinitial sponsored event\u201d as used in the two disputed MSA provisions had different meanings, Reynolds\u2019s reliance on the same meaning rule is unavailing. <em>(Palmer, </em>at p. 1116.)</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">\n<em>Last Antecedent Rule</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b483-8\">Also unavailing is Reynolds\u2019s reliance on the \u201clast antecedent rule,\u201d a rule of statutory and contractual interpretation requiring that prepositional phrases be read to modify the preceding term or phrase. <em>(Renee J., supra, 26 </em>Cal.4th at p. 743 [\u201c \u2018A longstanding rule of statutory construction\u2014the \u201clast antecedent rule\u201d\u2014provides that \u201cqualifying words, phrases and clauses are to be applied to the words or phrases immediately preceding and are not to be construed as extending to or including others more remote\u201d \u2019 \u201d], citing <em>White </em>v. <em>County of Sacramento </em>(1982) 31 Cal.3d 676, 680 [183 Cal.Rptr. 520, 646 P.2d 191] <em>(White); City of Victorville v.

Asserting the phrase \u201cat the site\u201d appeared only once in the MSA\u2019s subsection III(c)(3)(E)(ii) as the \u201clocational object\u201d of the clause \u201cit is placed,\u201d Reynolds contends the phrase \u201cat the site\u201d does not even arguably modify the phrase \u201cinitial sponsored event.\u201d Reynolds thus concludes that application of the last antecedent rule here would compel the interpretation that the phrase \u201cat the site\u201d in the MSA\u2019s subsection III(c)(3)(E)(ii) modified the immediately preceding term \u201cplaced\u201d and simply limited <em>\u201cwhere\u201d </em>signs could be \u201cplaced\u201d without any bearing on the subsequent phrase \u201cinitial sponsored event\u201d that limited <em>\u201cwhen\u201d </em>signs could be posted.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">However, the last antecedent rule is \u201c \u2018not immutable\u2019 \u201d and should not be \u201crigidly applied\u201d in all cases. <em>(In re Phelps </em>(2001) 93 Cal.App.4th 451, 456 [113 Cal.Rptr.2d 217] <em>(Phelps).) </em>One court-identified exception to the last antecedent rule \u201cprovides that when several words are followed by a clause that applies as much to the first and other words as to the last, \u2018 \u201c \u2018the natural construction of the language demands that the clause be read as applicable to all.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Renee J., supra, </em>26 Cal.4th at p. 743; <em>White, supra, </em>31 Cal.3d at pp. 680-681; <em>Phelps, </em>at p. 456; <em>Board of Trustees v. Judge </em>(1975) 50 Cal.App.3d 920, 926 [123 Cal.Rptr. 830] <em>(Board of Trustees).) </em>Further, \u201cthe rule of the last antecedent is merely an aid to construction, applicable only where there exist uncertainties and ambiguities. [Citations.] This merely means, however, that if the clear intent of the parties is opposed to the application of the rule, the rule must yield.\u201d <em>(Anderson, supra, </em>270 Cal.App.2d at pp. 349-350.)</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">The exemplar application of the last antecedent rule is a case where a modifying phrase appears after a list of multiple items or phrases. (See, e.g., <em>White, supra, </em>31 Cal.3d at p. 679.) This is not the classic case for application of the last antecedent rule since the MSA\u2019s subsection III(c)(3)(E)(ii) did not consist of a list of multiple words followed by a modifier. Instead, the MSA\u2019s subsection III(c)(3)(E)(ii) simply stated that nothing in the provisions of the MSA\u2019s subsection III(d) involving outdoor advertising would \u201capply to Outdoor Advertising advertising the Brand Name Sponsorship, to the extent that such Outdoor Advertising is placed at the site of a Brand Name Sponsorship no more than 90 days before the start of the initial sponsored event, is removed within 10 days after the end of the last sponsored event, and is not prohibited by subsection (3)(A) above.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">Further, the language of the MSA\u2019s subsection III(c)(3)(E)(ii) manifestly came within the exception to the last antecedent rule identified in <em>Renee J., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number><em>supra, 26 </em>Cal.4th at page 743; <em>White, supra, </em>31 Cal.3d at pages 680-681; <em>Phelps, supra, </em>93 Cal.App.4th at page 456; and <em>Board of Trustees, supra, </em>50 Cal.App.3d at page 926. Specifically, with respect to the central clause in subsection III(c)(3)(E)(ii) that exempted Reynolds\u2019s outdoor signage \u201cto the extent that such Outdoor Advertising is placed at the site of a Brand Name Sponsorship no more than 90 days before the start of the initial sponsored event,\u201d the words \u201cat the site of a Brand Name Sponsorship\u201d were followed immediately by the temporal restrictions relating to the start of the initial sponsored event without interruption by a comma and later by the temporal restrictions relating to the end of such event. <em>(White, </em>at p. 680; <em>Phelps, </em>at p. 456.) Thus, the natural construction of the central clause\u2019s language compelled that its phrase \u201cat the site\u201d be read as applying to the subsection\u2019s temporal restrictions as well as to the restriction on where Reynolds\u2019s outdoor advertising could be permissibly placed. Moreover, similar to the situation in <em>Phelps, </em>\u201cthere is only one antecedent and the qualifying phrase therefore must attach to all of it.\u201d <em>(Phelps, </em>at p. 457.) As such, the language of the central clause of the MSA\u2019s subsection III(c)(3)(E)(ii) clearly indicated it was \u201cintended as a <em>single </em>phrase, or antecedent to the qualifying clause. Under this construction, the \u2018last antecedent rule\u2019 has no application.\u201d (Ph<em>elps, </em>at p. 457.)</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">In sum, since the fact that the words \u201cat the site\u201d in the MSA\u2019s subsection III(c)(3)(E)(ii) limiting <em>where </em>Reynolds\u2019s signs could be posted did not preclude those words from also limiting <em>when </em>the signs could be posted, Reynolds\u2019s reliance on the last antecedent rule is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">\n<em>Reynolds\u2019s Commercial Speech Rights</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b485-9\">Reynolds characterizes the MSA as imposing a variety of express prohibitions and restrictions on Reynolds\u2019s marketing and advertising practices while otherwise preserving Reynolds\u2019s commercial speech rights by permitting signs promoting its Brand Name Sponsorship. <em>(Lorillard Tobacco Co. v. Reilly </em>(2001) 533 U.S. 525, 564 [121 S.Ct. 2404, 2426, 150 L.Ed.2d 532] [\u201cAs the State protects children from tobacco advertisements, tobacco manufacturers and retailers and their adult consumers still have a protected interest in communication\u201d].) However, Reynolds contends that in choosing from among the varied contractual interpretations proffered by the parties, the superior court reversibly erred in selecting the interpretation that assertedly created the greatest restriction on Reynolds\u2019s First Amendment rights.  Although acknowledging it waived any claims that the MSA was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>unconstitutional, Reynolds contends it did so only to the extent that the MSA contained express restrictions, limitations or obligations).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Thus, characterizing the disputed provisions of the MSA's subsection III(c)(3)(E)(ii) as far from an explicit and unambiguous restriction on its commercial speech rights, Reynolds contends those provisions should be strictly construed against any restriction on its First Amendment rights since such rights were assertedly among Reynolds's constitutional rights that had been reserved in the MSA and not expressly restricted. Accordingly, asserting the record contained no basis for concluding Reynolds clearly and compellingly intended to relinquish its constitutional rights, Reynolds concludes the court should construe the MSA in favor of preserving those rights and against a waiver.  (City of Glendale v. George (1989) 208 Cal.App.3d 1394, 1397-1398 [256 Cal.Rptr. 742] (Glendale).)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">Specifically, asserting its waiver of constitutional rights in the MSA was limited and must be strictly construed <em>{Glendale, supra, </em>208 Cal.App.3d at p. 1397), Reynolds contends that under the language of the MSA\u2019s section XV, its constitutional rights were not waived with respect to restrictions/limitations to which it did not expressly agree. Instead, according to Reynolds, it waived its constitutional rights only with respect to certain specified restrictions/limitations and never agreed that the MSA\u2019s subsection III(c)(3)(E)(ii)\u2019s restrictions/limitations on outdoor advertising would extend as far as the People urge. Reynolds thus concludes its constitutional waiver did not extend to the additional assertedly uncontemplated interpretation of such restrictions/limitations proffered by the People.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">In essence, despite having expressly waived in the MSA\u2019s section XV all rights to challenge the constitutionality of the MSA\u2019s express restrictions/ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>limitations, Reynolds contends there was an exception to such waiver if an express restriction/limitation in the MSA were construed contrary to Reynolds\u2019s preferred interpretation. However, this record reveals that counsel for Reynolds signed the MSA after good faith settlement negotiations. Further, regardless whether Reynolds anticipated a particular unfavorable interpretation of the restrictions/limitations in the disputed express provisions of the MSA, Reynolds nevertheless waived its right to contest those provisions as unconstitutional. (D. <em>H. Overmyer Co. </em>v. <em>Frick Co. </em>(1972) 405 U.S. 174, 187 [92 S.Ct. 775, 783-784, 31 L.Ed.2d 124]; <em>Davies v. Grossmont Union High School Dist. </em>(9th Cir. 1991) 930 F.2d 1390, 1394-1395.) Thus, even if a restriction/limitation in the disputed express provisions of the MSA were construed contrary to Reynolds\u2019s proffered interpretation, those express contractual terms remained express provisions subject to Reynolds\u2019s knowing and intentional waiver of the right to contest their constitutionality. Accordingly, Reynolds\u2019s claims based upon the alleged violation of its commercial speech rights are unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-9\">Haller, J., and McDonald, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-10\">Appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied June 25, 2003.
