Tire and Wheel Company, Inc. The owner filed a civil action against appellant and prevailed. A criminal prosecution followed and appellant was convicted, sentenced to state prison and ordered to pay direct victim restitution. The restitution order included $166,751.52 in attorney fees and private investigator\u2019s fees incurred by the owner in the civil action. Appellant argues that the fees were not properly the subject of a restitution order. We disagree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1408\">*1408</page-number>Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-4\">Gary Toussanian owned G.T. Tire and Wheel Company, Inc., and had employed appellant as his bookkeeper for 15 years. Eight years into their business relationship, appellant began embezzling funds. During the next seven years he embezzled over $300,000 from Toussanian and also filed false personal tax returns.</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-5\">When Toussanian discovered the extent of his loss, he filed a conversion action against appellant and prevailed. According to the probation report, he received a judgment of approximately $600,000.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The judgment included $41,751.52 in private investigator\u2019s fees. Although he had also incurred $125,000 in attorney fees pursuant to a contingency agreement with his counsel, those fees were not recoverable in the civil action. Toussanian has been unable to collect any part of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-6\">A criminal action was subsequently instituted against appellant. He waived his right to jury trial, entered a guilty plea to one count of grand theft of personal property (Pen. Code, \u00a7 487, subd. (a))<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and admitted the allegation that the value of the property taken exceeded $150,000. (\u00a7 12022.6, subd. (a)(2).) He also pleaded guilty to three counts of filing a false tax return. (Rev. &amp; Tax. Code, \u00a7 19705, subd. (a)(1).) The trial court imposed a sentence of four years and eight months in state prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-7\">Appellant was ordered to pay direct victim restitution of $694,185.66. The fines included payment of $496,271.31 to Toussanian; $12,339 for insufficient fund charges; $18,823.83 to the Franchise Tax Board; $41,751.52 for private investigative services; and $125,000 in attorney fees. Appellant was given credit for $38,000 already paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-8\">Prior to the court\u2019s imposition of sentence, defense counsel argued that the order of restitution should not include the $41,751.52 in private investigator fees and $125,000 in attorney fees. Counsel from the civil case was present at the sentencing hearing and stated that his 25 percent contingency fee agreement was reasonable. The trial court concluded that the costs of investigation and payment of attorney fees were permitted under the restitution statute (\u00a7 1202.4) and the civil investigation \u201cformed the basis\u201d for the criminal investigation. The court ordered that any payments made to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1409\">*1409</page-number>Toussanian through bankruptcy or any other source were to be offset against the award of restitution to avoid a double recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-6\">Appellant challenges $166,751.52 of the restitution award, which represents attorney fees and private investigator\u2019s fees. He argues that Toussanian was required to have used the public prosecutors and investigative agencies to recover the embezzled funds, rather than bringing a civil action. He also claims that the restitution award is a civil disposition of damages and thus outside the scope of the section 1202.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-7\">The California Constitution provides, \u201cIt is the unequivocal intention of the People of the State of California that all persons who suffer losses as a result of criminal activity shall have the right to restitution from the persons convicted of the crimes for losses they suffer.\u201d (Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 28, subd. (b).) The court must order direct victim restitution in \u201cevery case in which a victim has suffered economic loss as a result of the defendant\u2019s conduct.\u201d (\u00a7 1202.4, subd. (f); see also \u00a7 1202.4, subd. (a)(1).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-8\">The restitution order \u201cshall be of a dollar amount sufficient to fully reimburse the victim\u201d for economic losses caused by the defendant\u2019s criminal conduct. (\u00a7 1202.4, subd. (f)(3).) Economic loss \u2022 includes \u201cActual and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and other costs of collection accrued by a private entity on behalf of the victim.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>subd. (f)(3)(H).) Recoverable attorney fees have included those incurred to obtain a settlement from a defendant\u2019s insurer <em>(People </em>v. <em>Pinedo </em>(1998) 60 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1405-1406 [71 Cal.Rptr.2d 151]) and fees incurred to prevent the sale of a defendant\u2019s assets. <em>(People v. Lyon </em>(1996) 49 Cal.App.4th 1521, 1525 [57 Cal.Rptr.2d 415].)  We review a restitution order for an abuse of discretion and will not disturb the trial court\u2019s determination unless it is arbitrary, capricious and exceeds the bounds of reason. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hove </em>(1999) 76 Cal.App.4th 1266, 1275 [91 Cal.Rptr.2d 128]; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Carbajal </em>(1995) 10 Cal.4th 1114, 1121 [43 Cal.Rptr.2d 681, 899 P.2d 67].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-10\">Here, Tousanian\u2019s economic loss included the funds embezzled as well as the fees and costs incurred to recover those funds. Recovery of \u201creasonable attorney\u2019s fees and other costs of collection\u201d necessarily included the cost of the investigation to determine the extent of Toussanian\u2019s loss. Without evidence of embezzlement Toussanian could not have maintained a civil action to recover his damages. Both the investigation and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1410\">*1410</page-number>resulting civil action were \u201cproper, necessary, and a logical result of appellant\u2019s criminal conduct.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Lyon, supra, </em>49 Cal.App.4th at p. 1525.) Under these circumstances, to deny Toussanian the cost of investigative fees is to fail to fully reimburse him for his economic loss. Appellant cites no authority for the proposition that Toussanian was required to rely on a public agency for recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-4\">Appellant next argues that the order of restitution fell outside the purview of section 1202.4 because it amounted to a civil disposition of damages. He relies on <em>People v. Friscia </em>(1993) 18 Cal.App.4th 834 [22 Cal.Rptr.2d 656], which concerned embezzlement by an employee of a preschool. The owners of the school prepared an accounting to determine the amount of the loss. They valued their time at $50 per hour and requested restitution for over 200 hours spent searching their records. The court, applying the former restitution statute, section 1203.04, concluded that compensation for the teachers\u2019 time did not constitute lost wages and could not be the subject of a restitution order.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>(Friscia, </em>at p. 837.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-5\"><em>Friscia </em>is inapposite. It concerned a different restitution statute and addressed whether the time expended by the teachers constituted lost wages and profits under the language of that statute. <em>(People v. Friscia, supra, </em>18 Cal.App.4th at pp. 836-838.) By contrast, the issue before us is the application of section 1202.4 which expressly authorizes restitution for the costs of collection.</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-6\">Appellant also contends that Toussanian received a windfall because the trial court had included the investigator\u2019s fees in the civil judgment. We disagree. There is no indication that Toussanian collected any part of the civil judgment. Moreover, the statute provides that restitution collected will be credited against a civil judgment for losses arising from the same offense. (\u00a7 1202.4, subd. (j); see <em>People v. Bernal </em>(2002) 101 Cal.App.4th 155, 162-163, 168 [123 Cal.Rptr.2d 622].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1255-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1411\">*1411</page-number>Both the attorney fees and private investigator\u2019s fees constituted economic losses incurred by Toussanian as a result of appellant\u2019s conduct. Both were properly the subject of a restitution order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1255-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1255-6\">Gilbert, P. J., and Yegan, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1255-7\">Appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied July 23, 2003. Brown, J., did not participate therein.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1252-9\">Toussanian was awarded $371,271.31 plus prejudgment interest of $149,360.69 and punitive damages of $100,000.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1252-10\">All further references are to the Penal Code unless otherwise stated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1254-7\">When <em>People </em>v. <em>Friscia, supra, </em>18 Cal.App.4th 834, was decided, former Penal Code section 1203.04 read: \u201c \u2018(a) In every case where a person is convicted of a crime and is granted probation, the court shall require, as a condition of probation, that the person make restitution as follows: ffl] (1) To the victim, if the crime involved a victim. \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 [H] \u2022 . .
