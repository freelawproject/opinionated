We hold that they do not.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-10\">Trimedica International, Inc., Joseph Christy, Martha Christy, and General Nutrition Corporation (collectively Trimedica) appeal the trial court\u2019s order denying a special motion to strike pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16 (all statutory references are to the Code of Civil Procedure unless otherwise noted). Trimedica contends the lawsuit filed by Consumer Justice Center and Melanie Mars (collectively CJC or plaintiffs) constitutes a strategic lawsuit against public participation (SLAPP suit). We affirm the trial court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">Plaintiffs sued Trimedica for false advertising, consumer fraud and related claims with respect to the product Grobust. Trimedica\u2019s literature states that Grobust is a pill that \u201coffers a revolutionary breakthrough that provides a 100% natural alternative to breast implants.\u201d According to a \u201cdoctor\u201d (see pt. II.D., <em>post) </em>endorsing Grobust, \u201cClaims of a breast enlargement of one half inch in 45 days have been substantiated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">CJC\u2019s complaint alleged that Trimedica\u2019s claims about Grobust were false and misleading, in violation of the Consumers Legal Remedies Act (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1770, subd. (a)(5)) and the unfair competition law (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 17200 et seq.). Trimedica filed a special motion to strike pursuant to section 425.16 (the anti-SLAPP statute), arguing the CJC complaint constituted a SLAPP suit because the claims arose from acts in furtherance of Trimedica\u2019s rights to petition and to engage in free speech under the federal and California Constitutions. CJC countered by arguing the anti-SLAPP statute was not intended to protect allegedly false commercial speech. The trial court denied the motion, stating that Trimedica\u2019s commercial speech regarding Grobust did not implicate a public issue within the meaning of the anti-SLAPP statute. Pursuant to section 425.16, subdivision (j), this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b553-10\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b553-11\">A. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b553-12\">We exercise independent judgment to determine whether Trimedica\u2019s motion to strike should have been granted. <em>(Mission Oaks Ranch, Ltd. v. County of Santa Barbara </em>(1998) 65 Cal.App.4th 713, 721 [77 Cal.Rptr.2d 1].)</p>\n<p id=\"b553-13\">B. <em>Statutory Context</em></p>\n<p id=\"b553-14\">The Legislature adopted the anti-SLAPP statute in 1992, finding that \u201c[IJt is in the public interest to encourage continued participation in matters of public significance, and . . . this participation should not be chilled through abuse of the judicial process.\u201d (\u00a7 425.16, subd. (a).) Therefore, \u201cA cause of action against a person arising from any act of that person in furtherance of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>the person\u2019s right of petition or free speech under the United States or California Constitution in connection with a public issue shall be subject to a special motion to strike, unless the court determines that the plaintiff has established that there is a probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim.\u201d (\u00a7 425.16, subd. (b)(1).) The statute is to be \u201cconstrued broadly.\u201d (\u00a7 425.16, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">An \u201c \u2018act in furtherance of a person\u2019s right of petition or free speech . . . in connection with a public issue\u2019 includes: (1) any written or oral statement or writing made before a legislative, executive, or judicial proceeding, or any other official proceeding authorized by law; (2) any written or oral statement or writing made in connection with an issue under consideration or review by a legislative, executive, or judicial body, or any other official proceeding authorized by law; or (3) any written or oral statement or writing made in a place open to the public or a public forum in connection with an issue of public interest; (4) or any other conduct in furtherance of the exercise of the constitutional right of petition or the constitutional right of free speech in connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest.\u201d (\u00a7 425.16, subd. (e).)</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">The statute requires a two-part analysis to determine the propriety of granting or denying a motion to strike. First, we decide whether the causes of action arise from acts in furtherance of the defendant\u2019s right of free speech or right of petition. If the defendant has made such a showing, then we determine if the plaintiff has demonstrated a reasonable probability of prevailing. (\u00a7 425.16, subd. (b)(1).) We address each issue in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">C. <em>Acts in Furtherance of Trimedica\u2019s Rights of Free Speech and Petition</em></p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">When the defendant\u2019s alleged acts fall under the first two prongs of section 425.16, subdivision (e) (speech or petitioning before a legislative, executive, judicial, or other official proceeding, or statements made in connection with an issue under review or consideration by an official body), the defendant is not required to independently demonstrate that the matter is a \u201cpublic issue\u201d within the statute\u2019s meaning. <em>(Briggs </em>v. <em>Eden Council for Hope &amp; Opportunity </em>(1999) 19 Cal.4th 1106, 1113 [81 Cal.Rptr.2d 471, 969 P.2d 564].) If, however, the defendant\u2019s alleged acts fall under the third or fourth prongs of subdivision (e), there is an express \u201cissue of public interest\u201d limitation. (Briggs, at p. 1117.)</p>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">Because Trimedica\u2019s alleged acts constitute purely commercial speech and do not involve the rights of speech or petition before any official body, the public interest limitation applies. Therefore, unless Trimedica\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>speech concerns a matter of public interest within the meaning of the statute, section 425.16 does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">Trimedica argues that \u201cherbal dietary supplements and other forms of complementary medicine are the subject of public interest.\u201d As support, Trimedica cites regulations of herbal supplements by the Federal Trade Commission and the Food and Drug Administration pursuant to acts of Congress. Yet Trimedica\u2019s speech is not about herbal supplements in general. It is commercial speech about the specific properties and efficacy of a particular product, Grobust. If we were to accept Trimedica\u2019s argument that we should examine the nature of the speech in terms of generalities instead of specifics, then nearly any claim could be sufficiently abstracted to fall within the anti-SLAPP statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">CJC suggests a hypothetical regarding false statements made in the course of a real property sale. Blackacre sells a house to Whiteacre, and Whiteacre sues, claiming the defendant misrepresented the square footage. Blackacre brings a special motion to strike, claiming his speech involves a matter of public interest, because millions of Americans live in houses and buy and sell houses. CJC correctly suggests that applying the anti-SLAPP statute in such a case would be absurd.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">This case is no more about the general topic of herbal supplements than the hypothetical above is about the general topic of buying and selling houses. The lawsuit in the hypothetical is about the specific topic of whether Blackacre misrepresented the house\u2019s square footage to Whiteacre. The topic of this lawsuit is whether Trimedica misrepresented the specific properties and benefits of Grobust. Neither is a matter of general public interest within the meaning of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-9\">Although Trimedica cites <em>DuPont Merck Pharmaceutical Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(2000) 78 Cal.App.4th 562 [92 Cal.Rptr.2d 755] (hereafter <em>DuPont) </em>in support of its argument, this case supports our conclusion that Trimedica\u2019s claims about Grobust are not a matter of public interest. In <em>DuPont, </em>the consumer plaintiffs alleged the defendant pharmaceutical company artificially inflated the price of its product, Coumadin, by disseminating false information regarding the drug\u2019s generic equivalent. The complaint alleged the false statements were made before regulatory bodies, to the medical profession, and to the public. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 564.) While the statements made before regulatory bodies fell under the first two prongs of section 425.16, subdivision (e), the statements to the public at large fell under the third and fourth prongs, and were therefore required to relate to a public issue. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number><em>(DuPont, </em>at pp. 566-567.) The court noted, \u201cWe find the answer to this question in the first amended complaint. Plaintiffs allege: \u2018More than 1.8 million Americans have purchased Coumadin, an anti-coagulant medication, for the prevention and treatment of blood clots that can lead to life-threatening conditions such as stroke and pulmonary embolism. \u2019 Both the number of persons allegedly affected and the seriousness of the conditions treated establish the issue as one of public interest.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 567.)</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">Like the <em>DuPont </em>court, we look to CJC\u2019s complaint, which alleges Trimedica made the following claim, among others, about Grobust: \u201cThe All-Natural Way To A Fuller, More Beautiful Bust! When you want a fuller, firmer, more beautiful bustline, don\u2019t resort to traumatic, dangerous surgeries. . . . Herbal Grobust\u2122 offers a revolutionary breakthrough that provides a 100% natural alternative to breast implants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">The conclusion that Grobust and Coumadin have little in common should be self-evident. Grobust does not treat life-threatening conditions such as stroke and pulmonary embolism, nor is there evidence it is widely used. Therefore, Grobust does not qualify as a matter of public interest by examining either \u201cthe number of persons allegedly affected\u201d or \u201cthe seriousness of the conditions treated. . . .\u201d <em>(DuPont, supra, </em>78 Cal.App.4th at p. 567.) <em>DuPont </em>is factually inapposite, and its holding should be limited to specific speech relating to true matters of public interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">The stated intent of the anti-SLAPP statute is \u201cto encourage continued participation in matters of public significance.\u201d (\u00a7 425.16, subd. (a).) No logical interpretation of this statement suggests that \u201cmatters of public significance\u201d include specific advertising statements about a particular commercial product, absent facts which truly make that product a matter of genuine public interest, as was the case in <em>DuPont. </em>If we were to do so, nearly any product could claim its speech was about a topic of public interest. Construing the statute in this manner would allow every defendant in every false advertising case (or nearly any case that involves any type of speech) to bring a special motion to strike under the anti-SLAPP statute, even though it is obvious that the case was not filed for the purpose of chilling participation in matters of public interest. Because an order granting or denying the motion to strike is immediately appealable pursuant to section 425.16, subdivision (j), every such case would be delayed for a period of months or years while the appellate court used its scarce resources to consider any merit it might have. We do not believe the Legislature intended the statute to be construed in such a manner, and decline to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>D. <em>CJC\u2019s Probability of Prevailing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">Even if we had decided that Grobust is an issue of public interest within the meaning of the statute, we would nonetheless find that the trial court had correctly denied Trimedica\u2019s motion to strike.  Under the second prong of section 425.16, subdivision (b)(1), a motion to strike under the anti-SLAPP statute must be denied if the plaintiff establishes a probability of prevailing. To establish the requisite probability of prevailing, the plaintiff must state and substantiate a legally sufficient claim. <em>(Briggs </em>v. <em>Eden Council for Hope &amp; Opportunity, supra, </em>19 Cal.4th at p. 1123.) \u201cPut another way, the plaintiff \u2018must demonstrate that the complaint is both legally sufficient and supported by a sufficient prima facie showing of facts to sustain a favorable judgment if the evidence submitted by the plaintiff is credited.\u2019 \u201d <em>{Wilson v. Parker, Covert &amp; Chidester </em>(2002) 28 Cal.4th 811, 821 [123 Cal.Rptr.2d 19, 50 P.3d 733].)</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">In opposition to the motion to strike, CJC submitted a declaration by Kim Elaine Barrett. Barrett holds a Ph.D. in biological chemistry and has postdoctoral training. She is currently employed as a professor of medicine and vice-chair for research, department of medicine, at the University of California, San Diego. She has extensive experience reviewing research regarding human physiology. In addition, she has served on the editorial boards of numerous peer-reviewed medical journals, and published more than 140 papers, chapters, and reviews.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">Barrett reviewed the qualifications of Robert W. Bradford and the study he purportedly performed with respect to Grobust, which was included in the Grobust advertisements. She also reviewed the advertisements and claims for Grobust, its listed ingredients, and the medical literature regarding the active ingredients. She noted Grobust\u2019s advertisements included claims that the product was a breast enlarger, and that its safety and effectiveness had been scientifically proven. Barrett noted, however, that \u201cclaims for ingested substances are accepted by the respectable scientific community only when these claims have been verified by two independent, placebo-controlled, double-blind, well-documented studies, performed by qualified independent experts, with statistically significant differences between test and control groups.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b557-9\">Accordingly, Barrett reviewed the reported results of the Grobust study performed by Bradford. The stated results (including \u201c82% experienced bust growth\u201d) did not state the measurement techniques for the parameters assessed, the extent of the changes experienced, or whether the results <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>achieved statistical significance. Moreover, it was not a double-blind, placebo-controlled, or independent study, nor did the results appear in any peer-reviewed scientific literature. Barrett concluded that the Bradford study was \u201ctotally unacceptable as scientific evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">Barrett also reviewed Bradford\u2019s qualifications. The Grobust literature presents Bradford as a \u201cDoctor of Science and a Professor of the Capital University of Integrative Medicine . . . .\u201d According to Barrett\u2019s research, Bradford does not have a doctorate or any scientific training from any accredited institution, nor has he published any peer-reviewed research. Bradford\u2019s \u201cdoctorate\u201d appears to be an honorary degree from an unaccredited institution. The Capital University of Integrative Medicine is not accredited or recognized by any legitimate scientific organization. Barrett opined that Bradford was not competent to state an expert scientific opinion regarding Grobust.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">Barrett reviewed the list of ingredients provided by Trimedica, and researched the peer-reviewed studies and literature regarding each ingredient.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> She was unable to locate any valid scientific data which would validate the claims made for Grobust. Based on the facts and research, Barrett stated there was no competent evidence to support the claim that Grobust increases breast size.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">Barrett further noted that no research had been performed on the long-term effects on humans of the active ingredients of Grobust. Therefore, the ingredients potentially pose long-term health risks. The ingredients might also interact with other drugs and substances in use by the general population. Given these factors, there was no scientific justification for calling Grobust \u201csafe.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">Trimedica did not submit any countervailing evidence in the court below. Instead, it challenged the admissibility of the Barrett declaration and asserted that CJC had not met the required burden of proof. We disagree. Trimedica suggested to the trial court that CJC must affirmatively prove that Grobust was a worthless product by presenting scientifically valid studies of its own. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>If this were the standard, only the rarest of plaintiffs would ever be able to prevail on the second prong of a special motion to strike.  To the contrary, the plaintiffs burden to establish a probability of prevailing on its claim must be compatible with the early stage at which the motion is brought, and the parties\u2019 limited opportunity to conduct discovery. <em>(Wilcox v. Superior Court </em>(1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 809, 823-824 [33 Cal.Rptr.2d 446].) We do not weigh the evidence, but accept as true all evidence favorable to the plaintiff. <em>(Dixon v. Superior Court </em>(1994) 30 Cal.App.4th 733, 746 [36 Cal.Rptr.2d 687].)</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">Here, the gravamen of CJC\u2019s complaint is that Trimedica falsely advertised Grobust as a product that enlarges women\u2019s breasts. The Barrett declaration states Trimedica has no reasonable scientific basis for claiming that Grobust is either safe or effective as a breast enlarger. From the Barrett declaration, a reasonable trier of fact could conclude: (1) Grobust advertising created the impression that Grobust was a scientifically proven formula that would increase the size of a woman\u2019s breasts; (2) that assertion was misleading because it was not supported by any reliable scientific proof; and (3) at a minimum, Trimedica should have known its advertising created that impression. This is a sufficient prima facie case to withstand a special motion to strike pursuant to section 425.16.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b559-9\">The court\u2019s order denying Trimedica\u2019s motion is affirmed. CJC is entitled to its costs on appeal, including attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-10\">Bedsworth, Acting P. J., and Aronson, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-11\">A petition for a rehearing was denied April 28, 2003, and appellants\u2019 petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied June 11, 2003.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b558-8\">According to Barrett\u2019s declaration, Trimedica has indicated that Grobust contains the following ingredients: blessed thistle (cnicus benedictus), dandelion root (taraxacum officinale), damiana (tumera aphrodisiaca), dong quai (angelica sinensis), lcava kava (piper methysticum), motherwort (leonuros caridaca), sabal (saw palmetto), and wild yam. We note that Barrett\u2019s declaration was signed on August 22, 2001, prior to the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s consumer advisory regarding kava\u2019s potential to cause liver damage. (Food &amp; Drug Admin., Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, <em>Consumer Advisory: Kava-Containing Dietary Supplements May Be Associated with Severe Liver Injury </em>(Mar. 25, 2002) &lt;http:// www.cfsan.fda.gov/~dms/addskava.html&gt; [as of Mar. 27, 2003].)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
