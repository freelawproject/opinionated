(Fam. Code, \u00a7 6200 et seq.) With her applications, appellant declared that Guijosa was violent and that she feared him. She specified that in November of 2001, he tried to force her into sex and tried to cut her face with a piece of glass \u201cso that no one would want her.\u201d When she attempted to get away, he cut her wrist and palm. On December 30, 2001, he damaged the prosthesis in her right eye by hitting it, and on December 31, 2001, from midnight until 2:00 in the morning, he kicked the front door of the home where she was staying and yelled obscenities. He constantly called her, and stalked her. She was afraid that he would hurt her, and as a result had stopped going to her English classes.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-10\">The trial court denied the request for a temporary restraining order, and when the matter was called for a hearing on February 7, denied the application without a hearing. The court stated its reasons with reference to a single sentence in the declaration: \u201cour children are in Mexico.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b971-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1079\">*1079</page-number>The trial court first noted that it had denied the request for a temporary restraining order because \u201cI didn\u2019t see, first of all, what she is doing in this country when her children are in Mexico because a mother\u2019s primary duty and a father\u2019s primary duty is to their children. And I didn\u2019t see why should she even be in this court since she should be where her children are.\u201d The court told appellant\u2019s counsel that all appellant had to do to be free from Guijosa\u2019s violence was to \u201cgo back to where she came from, where her children are, and be with her children,\u201d then ruled that \u201cI\u2019m not going to afford her the benefit of the court\u2019s protection when her children are abandoned in Mexico\u201d and that \u201cthe court is not going to be a party to condoning or facilitating the abandonment of these children, so I respectfully decline to offer her a restraining order and I am dismissing the case without prejudice.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b971-5\">At that point, Guijosa asked to speak. He told the court that he was the victim, not the victimizer, and the court advised him, too, to return to Mexico.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-6\">We agree with appellant that the trial court abused its discretion by deciding this case on facts entirely irrelevant to the Domestic Violence Prevention Act, the purpose of which is not to mandate that parents live with their children, but to \u201cprevent the recurrence of acts of violence and sexual abuse and to provide for a separation of the persons involved in the domestic violence for a period sufficient to enable these persons to seek a resolution of the causes of the violence.\u201d (Fam. Code, \u00a7 6220.)</p>\n<p id=\"b971-7\">The Legislature has set forth the relevant factors in Family Code section 6300, by providing that a domestic violence restraining order may be issued \u201cif an affidavit shows, to the satisfaction of the court, reasonable proof of a past act or acts of abuse.\u201d \u201cAbus\u00e9\u201d is defined. It means intentionally or recklessly causing or attempting to cause bodily injury, sexual assault, or placing a person in reasonable apprehension of imminent serious bodily injury to that person or to another. (Fam. Code, \u00a7 6203.)</p>\n<p id=\"b971-8\">Given all this, the trial court\u2019s comments were not merely legally unsound, but offensive, and ignored the fact that the law affords its protections to all the people described in the statutes, not just those individuals whose choices please the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-9\">Appellant has asked us to remand this case for a hearing on the merits, before a different judicial officer. That is our ruling. (Code Civ. Proc., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1080\">*1080</page-number>\u00a7 170.1, subd. (c).) We note in closing that if appellant had sought relief through petition for writ of mandate, rather than through an appeal, we would have been able to afford speedier, and perhaps more effective, relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-4\">\n<em>Disposition</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b972-5\">The trial court ruling is reversed, and the case is remanded to the superior court for hearing, with direction to that court to assign the matter to a. different judicial officer. Appellant shall recover her costs of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-6\">Grignon, Acting P. J., and Mosk, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b970-11\">He has not filed a brief on this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b971-10\">There was no evidence that the children had been \u201cabandoned.\u201d The only evidence was that they were not living with their parents.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
