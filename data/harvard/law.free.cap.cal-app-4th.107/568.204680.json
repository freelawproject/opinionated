J.</author>\n<p id=\"AOI\">This appeal is from an order striking a complaint under Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16, the anti-SLAPP (strategic lawsuits against public participation) statute.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The trial court ruled that plaintiff 1-800 Contacts, Inc.\u2019s causes of action against defendant Craig S. Steinberg, for inducing breach of contract and \u201cinducing breach of fiduciary and statutory duties,\u201d arose from acts by Steinberg in furtherance of his constitutional rights of petition or free speech in connection with a public issue (\u00a7 425.16, subds. (b)(1), (e)), and that plaintiff had failed, both factually and for legal reasons, to establish a probability of prevailing on either claim. (\u00a7 425.16, subd. (b)(1).) Plaintiff contests both elements of the ruling, and also contends that the court reversibly erred by refusing to allow it to take Stein-berg\u2019s deposition before deciding the motion to strike. We find plaintiffs various contentions unavailing, and affirm the order striking the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-9\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b526-10\">This lawsuit is an offshoot of a controversy between plaintiff, a discount direct seller of replacement contact lenses headquartered in Utah, and a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>former in-house attorney for plaintiff, Jerrald D. Conder (Conder), which is the subject of a Utah lawsuit. Plaintiff contends that Conder has breached both fiduciary duties to plaintiff and a severance agreement with it, by offering his services to groups of optometrists, to seek laws regulating the activities of businesses like plaintiff. The present suit against Steinberg, a California lawyer and optometrist who has long been an opponent of plaintiff, charges him with inducing Conder\u2019s alleged breaches of contract and fiduciary duty, by facilitating meetings between Conder and representatives of optometric associations.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">\n<em>The Complaint.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">The unverified complaint alleged as follows. Plaintiff, the largest business of its type, competes with Steinberg and other optometrists in selling contact lenses. Between April 1999 and his termination in August 2001, Conder, as an in-house counsel, assisted plaintiff in legislative initiatives, regulatory proceedings, and litigation, threatened and actual. In most of these matters, plaintiff stood in a position adverse to optometrists or their state boards or associations. Among the lawsuits was one Steinberg brought in 1999 on behalf of California optometrists, which settled in April 2001.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">Upon termination of his employment, Conder entered into a severance agreement (the agreement), which was attached to the complaint. In it, Conder gave plaintiff a general release, and plaintiff agreed to pay him six months\u2019 salary. In addition, Conder agreed not to (1) \u201cdiscuss any confidential information of [plaintiff]\u201d without plaintiff\u2019s written consent, on pain of forfeiting the right to severance pay; (2) for two years not to join, participate in, or be retained by any person or entity \u201chaving a majority of its sales from products or services similar to or competitive with those of [plaintiff]\u201d in any territory where plaintiff did business; or (3) make \u201cany public statement or statements to anyone concerning [plaintiff], its business objectives [or] management practices ... or any other proprietary information of [plaintiff].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">On January 18, 2002, Steinberg met with Conder at a Las Vegas hotel, at which the midyear meeting of optometrists of the American Optometric Association was ongoing. Plaintiff alleged on information and belief that Steinberg, with Conder\u2019s knowledge and participation, had previously invited optometrists to meet with them and learn about, among other things, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>plaintiffs \u201cstrategies and other confidential information\u201d that could assist them in taking legislative or legal action adverse to plaintiff. At a meeting in a hotel restaurant, Conder advised Steinberg that he had a confidentiality agreement with plaintiff, but also spoke about information he had learned while representing plaintiff, which he said could help others in taking such legislative or legal action.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">On the same day, the complaint alleged, Steinberg and Conder met throughout the afternoon, in a hotel bar, with individuals who plaintiff alleged on information and belief \u201cwere representatives of various state optometric associations.\u201d Pursuant to Steinberg\u2019s request, Conder spoke about information he had gained while representing plaintiff, which could be used against it.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He also allegedly disclosed confidential communications between plaintiff and state officials, including the California Attorney General\u2019s Office. Conder and Steinberg announced further meetings that evening with other optometrists. On information and belief, those meetings went forward, and plaintiffs \u201cconfidential information\u201d was discussed at them. Plaintiff also alleged on information and belief that Conder and Steinberg intended to hold similar meetings, with at least one scheduled for February 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">Incorporating these allegations, the complaint proceeded to set forth a first cause of action, for \u201cInducing Breach of Fiduciary and Statutory Duties.\u201d It alleged that by virtue of his former attorney-client relationship with plaintiff, Conder owed plaintiff \u201ca fiduciary duty, including duties of loyalty and confidentiality.\u201d Those duties were allegedly \u201crecognized and set forth in State Bar Rules of Professional Conduct throughout the United States, including the State Bars of both Utah and California.\u201d The complaint quoted from two of the Utah Rules of Professional Conduct (Utah Rules), one of which provides (with limited exceptions) that a lawyer \u201cshall not reveal information relating to representation of a client\u201d without its consent (Utah Rules, rule 1.6(a)), and the other of which provides that a lawyer shall not use information relating to a former representation to disadvantage the former client, except as allowed by Utah Rules, rule 1.6, or when the information is generally known. (Utah Rules, rule 1.9(b).) Conder allegedly had violated these rules by divulging \u201cconfidential information\u201d to Stein-berg, and by \u201cimproperly\u201d using and disseminating information relating to his former representation of plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>The complaint proceeded to allege that Steinberg had induced Conder \u201cto violate his fiduciary duties to [plaintiff], including duties established by the [Utah Rules] . . . .\u201d Conder had violated these duties \u201cby, among other things,\u201d using information acquired during his representation of plaintiff to its disadvantage, revealing confidential or privileged information to others including plaintiffs competitors, and assisting adverse parties in matters \u201cwhich are the same or or substantially related to his prior representation . . . .\u201d Steinberg\u2019s inducement of Conder so to act also allegedly violated \u201cthe standards set by and [Steinberg\u2019s] duties under the California Rules of Professional Conduct.\u201d In that regard, the complaint quoted Business and Professions Code section 6068, subdivision (e), which requires an attorney to maintain the confidence and preserve the secrets of a client, and rules 1-120 and 3-210 of the State Bar Rules of Professional Conduct (rules), which respectively provide that a member shall not knowingly induce or assist in any violation of the rules or the State Bar Act (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 6000 et seq.), and shall not advise the violation of any law or rule, unless the member in good faith believes it is invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">Plaintiff alleged that Conder\u2019s and Steinberg\u2019s conduct had caused it compensable injury, and that Steinberg\u2019s acts were malicious and oppressive, justifying punitive damages. In addition, plaintiff prayed injunctive relief, restraining Steinberg from \u201cfurther disseminating [plaintiffs] privileged and/or confidential information,\u201d and requiring him to identify all persons \u201cto whom he has thus far disseminated such information . . . .\u201d In support of this prayer, plaintiff alleged that the information to which Conder was privy \u201cis among the most sensitive information belonging to [plaintiff],\u201d because the risk of adverse legislation or litigation by optometrists and their associations posed \u201c[o]ne of the greatest threats to [plaintiffs] continuing viability.\u201d Hence, its dissemination to adverse parties had caused and would cause plaintiff irreparable harm. Plaintiff also requested that Steinberg be enjoined from representing any persons with interests adverse to plaintiffs in matters \u201csubstantially factually related to Conder\u2019s prior representation of [plaintiff].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">The complaint\u2019s second cause of action, for inducing breach of contract, incorporated the allegations of the first, and then alleged on information and belief that Steinberg knew of the agreement, and induced Conder to breach it by discussing confidential information with third parties, assisting persons who had a majority of sales competitive with plaintiff, and making public statements concerning \u201cproprietary information\u201d of plaintiff. Plaintiff alleged it had been damaged thereby, and prayed compensatory and punitive damages and injunctive relief on this cause of action too.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>\n<em>The Motion to Strike.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">Immediately after the complaint was filed, plaintiff noticed a motion for a preliminary injunction, and Steinberg moved to strike the complaint under section 425.16. Steinberg\u2019s motion averred that his activities challenged by the complaint involved acts in furtherance of free speech and petition in connection with a public issue, namely \u201c[t]he issue of illegal sales of contact lenses . . . .\u201d The motion further contended that plaintiff could not establish a likelihood of success on the complaint, because Steinberg had neither intended nor acted to induce Conder to breach the agreement or his fiduciary duties. Furthermore, plaintiff could not show compensable damages, which had not occurred and\u2019in any event would consist of preclusion from disobeying the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">In support of the motion, Steinberg filed his declaration, in which he first described his prior lawsuit against plaintiff, which had alleged that plaintiff was selling contact lenses without verifying the existence or terms of prescriptions for them, in violation of Business and Professions Code section 2546 et seq. During that litigation, Steinberg stated, he had gained extensive knowledge about plaintiffs operations, including what he termed its violation of state laws, much of it from Garth T. Vincent (Vincent), plaintiffs counsel in that case (and in the present case). Steinberg also had become acquainted with the other litigation involving plaintiff referenced in the present complaint. An association of state optometric regulatory boards had asked him to lecture about his lawsuit, and more recently several such boards had consulted him about proposed legislation and regulations concerning mail-order contact lens distribution. Steinberg stated that much of what he knew about plaintiff came from its own Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings. He appended a recent one, which included discussion of lawsuits and administrative actions against plaintiff, and the caveat that \u201cA significant portion of the Company\u2019s sales may not comply with applicable state laws and regulations governing the delivery and sale of contact lenses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">Steinberg declared that he first heard of Conder when he received an e-mail from him dated December 3, 2001, describing his background with plaintiff and stating he now planned to consult with optometric associations about governmental relations and legislation to \u201ccompel compliance with prescriptive requirements.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Familiar with Steinberg\u2019s work from the prior lawsuit, Conder suggested they might work together. He noted, however, that he had signed a \u201cnon-competition agreement\u201d with plaintiff, and stated he would not \u201creveal any inside company information.\u201d Later that day, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>Conder sent Steinberg another e-mail, in which he reiterated that he \u201cwould not reveal any confidential information.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">Conder proposed that he and Steinberg work together in a legislative consulting business for state optometric associations regarding mail order contact lens sales, proposing legislation to \u201cfix\u201d weaknesses in existing law. The idea appealed to Steinberg, in part because Vincent had previously told him that plaintiff intended to pursue legislation and to violate laws that were ineffective. Steinberg contacted numerous state optometric associations, and arranged meetings coincident with the upcoming January 2002 national meeting in Las Vegas. He did not propose any litigation. In general e-mails, he identified Conder as an expert who \u201cknows every loophole and every weakness in the current laws, and how to close them, knows the strategies of the mail order companies, and has extensive experience in the mail order business and in lobbying in it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">Steinberg met with Conder for the first time in Las Vegas. They discussed preparing \u201caudits\u201d of existing legislation and proposals for new legislation. According to Steinberg, Conder again stated \u201cthat he would not reveal any confidential information about [plaintiff] or its business practices and we should be sure to make that clear at our meetings. He did not want anybody to think they could buy or gain access to confidential information by hiring us. He reiterated that to each and every person we met with. He made it clear that he was not selling \u2018secret\u2019 information, he was only offering his skills in analyzing and fixing laws related to optometry.\u201d In addition, Conder told both Steinberg and the individuals they later met with that he had an agreement with plaintiff prohibiting him from working for persons that earned more than half their income from contact lens sales, and he asked both Steinberg and the associations whether they derived such income. Each answered negatively.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">Steinberg further declared that \u201cI am not aware that I know any confidential information regarding [plaintiff].\u201d The information Conder had told him, at their initial meeting and the ensuing ones with association representatives, had already been within Steinberg\u2019s knowledge, from public sources or from his dealings with plaintiff and Vincent. However, Conder did tell him that he (Steinberg) was greatly disliked by plaintiffs principals, because of his prior lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">Steinberg declared that plaintiff had recently sold contact lenses to patients whose prescriptions, Steinberg had notified plaintiff, had already expired. In a supplemental declaration, Steinberg further documented these transactions, and attached a copy of the settlement agreement in his prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>action, which required plaintiff to follow procedures that these sales allegedly had violated. Steinberg stated he intended to file a cross-complaint for breach of his settlement agreement.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">In addition to his own declaration, Steinberg filed one by Conder. Conder declared that shortly after being terminated by plaintiff, he had been told by its officer John Nichols that both he and plaintiffs president, Jonathan Coon, concurred that the noncompetition provision of the agreement permitted Conder to work for optometrists associations.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Conder proceeded to ascertain that neither those associations nor, probably, any optometrist earned over half their income from contact lens sales. Conder thereafter contacted Steinberg, telling him he would not reveal confidential information regarding plaintiff, and that he had agreed to the noncompetition clause. Steinberg responded that to his knowledge no association came within it.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">Conder met Steinberg in Las Vegas on January 18, 2002, and again told him that \u201cI was not there to discuss or reveal confidential information with anyone.\u201d They then met with representatives of three optometric associations, and Conder told them he and Steinberg were interested in assisting them with legislative matters. Conder announced he had an agreement with plaintiff that precluded him from revealing confidential information, which he intended to honor, and he could discuss matters about plaintiff only if publicly known. He proceeded to discuss, among other things, a multidistrict litigation and a suit that had recently been commenced against plaintiff by Johnson &amp; Johnson.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Although he also discussed plaintiffs legislative activity in several states, \u201cThere was no discussion regarding any matter that I was not certain was not available in the public arena.\u201d When asked the extent of plaintiffs lobbying expenditures in Texas, Conder stated he did not know, but that such expenditures could be looked up from public reports. Steinberg may have mentioned plaintiffs Web pages as lobbying tools used in Kansas and Texas. According to Conder, there was no discussion about \u201cmeeting with the California Attorney General.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">Conder admitted having acquired confidential information during his employment with plaintiff, but denied ever having intentionally revealed any of it, and acknowledged \u201cmy obligation not to unless I know the information has been made public.\u201d Conder characterized as inaccurate assertions\u2014in plaintiffs declarations in support of a preliminary injunction\u2014that he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>made such disclosures to Steinberg and to the associations in Las Vegas, and he stated that plaintiff\u2019s witnesses were not competent to identify information as confidential, as opposed to known to the public and particularly in the eye care industry.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">Steinberg also filed a declaration by an expert optometrist concerning the hazards faced by contact lens wearers who did not regularly have their eyes examined and their prescriptions renewed.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">\n<em>Plaintiff's Opposition.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">In its opposition to the motion to strike, plaintiff asserted that Conder and Steinberg necessarily intended to \u201cmarket\u201d confidential and privileged information at the Las Vegas meetings, because Steinberg had no prior lobbying experience, and Conder admitted having little experience with optometric issues before plaintiff employed him. Steinberg, in other words, had agreed to join with Conder in \u201cprofiting from information Conder had learned while representing [plaintiff] . . . .\u201d Plaintiff argued that Steinberg\u2019s association with and assistance of Conder in the disclosure of confidential information did not involve a valid exercise of First Amendment rights, subject to section 425.16, subdivision (b)(1). Moreover, plaintiff contended, the evidence established a probability it would prevail on both causes of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">Plaintiff submitted several declarations in opposition. Vincent declared that during much of Conder\u2019s employment by plaintiff, he had participated in all of plaintiffs litigation, regulatory, and legislative matters, including analyzing state laws and developing strategies to combat optometrists\u2019 efforts to restrict plaintiffs operations. Vincent had never discussed with Steinberg plaintiffs \u201cinternal analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of laws ... or its litigation, regulatory or legislative strategies,\u201d which Vincent considered privileged and confidential, and which plaintiff had treated as such. Plaintiffs president, Coon, reiterated this assertion in his own declaration, and stated he had never authorized Conder to disclose confidential information or use against plaintiff information he had learned while representing it. Coon reiterated the complaint\u2019s allegation that \u201cOne of the greatest threats to [plaintiffs] continuing viability is the risk of adverse legislation or litigation brought by optometrists and their associations,\u201d and that therefore dissemination of privileged or confidential information to which Conder was privy would likely cause plaintiff irreparable injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>Plaintiff filed two other declarations, which substantially repeated two others that had been filed on plaintiffs application for preliminary injunction. Stuart Williams, an attorney in the West Jordan City Attorney\u2019s Office in Utah, testified that an employee of plaintiffs had alerted him that Conder and Steinberg would be meeting at a Las Vegas hotel to discuss confidential information of plaintiff that could aid optometrists in taking legislative or legal action adverse to it. Williams \u201cwas asked to go to that location . . . and obtain any information I could about these meetings.\u201d The next day, January 18, 2002, Williams saw Conder and Steinberg in a hotel restaurant. Williams sat down near Conder, enabling him to hear their conversation. Conder told Steinberg about his prior representation of plaintiff and that he had signed a confidentiality agreement and been paid upon termination. \u201cMr. Conder also spoke about certain information he said he had learned while representing [plaintiff] that could help others succeed in taking legislative or legal action against [it].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">Williams followed Steinberg and Conder to a hotel bar, where he continued to listen as they met with representatives of optometric associations. Williams declared that Conder spoke about various matters referred to in the complaint. Williams\u2019s account of what he overheard is summarized in the margin.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">In a similar declaration, John G. Todd, a Las Vegas private investigator, stated that plaintiff had asked him to obtain information about the January 2002 meetings. He attended those in the bar, and sat close to Conder. Todd\u2019s account of what he heard largely tracked Williams\u2019s, although Todd also stated Conder had referred to plaintiffs analysis of jurisdictional and commerce clause issues, plaintiffs legislative efforts in a few additional states, \u201caccusations made against [plaintiff] by various state optometry or licensing boards, including the State of Washington, and [plaintiffs] strategies and practices in connection with such communications.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>In a reply memorandum and a separate statement of objections, Steinberg asserted that neither of the last two declarants had demonstrated knowledge foundational to identifying confidential information. Steinberg also argued, among other things, that there existed no such California tort as inducing breach of fiduciary duty, and that plaintiff lacked entitlement to sue Stein-berg, who had never been its attorney, for supposed violation of professional rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">\n<em>The Court\u2019s Rulings.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">The trial court granted the motion to strike. The court first ruled that the acts complained of were taken in furtherance of Steinberg\u2019s constitutional rights of free speech or petition (\u00a7 425.16, subd. (b)(1)), in that they involved delivery of information to assist optometrists and their associations in taking legislative (or legal) action. The court at this point referred to the protection afforded by Civil Code section 47, subdivision (b) (the \u201clitigation privilege\u201d) to discussions attendant to or connected with contemplated proceedings. (See <em>Cayley v. Nunn </em>(1987) 190 Cal.App.3d 300, 304 [235 Cal.Rptr. 385].)</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">The court then assessed plaintiffs showing regarding its probability of prevailing in the action. Observing that both causes of action required that Steinberg have known of the duties he allegedly induced Conder to breach, and have intended to induce their breach, the court held that plaintiff had failed to show, prima facie, that Steinberg had intended that Conder breach the agreement or his fiduciary duties to plaintiff. Steinberg had not solicited Conder so to act. Rather, the complaint and the evidence showed that Conder had approached Steinberg, with the idea of their allying to provide optometric associations services relating to legislation enforcing contact lens prescription requirements. \u201cFrom the facts, it appears that Conder already intended to breach the contract by the time he contacted Steinberg . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b536-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>Before the ruling on the motion to strike, plaintiff had sought leave to take Steinberg\u2019s deposition, in connection with both that motion and the then-pending motion for a preliminary injunction.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Section 425.16, subdivision (g) stays all discovery during the pendency of a motion to strike under subdivision (b), but allows the court to permit specified discovery, \u201con noticed motion and for good cause shown.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">The court denied plaintiffs initial, ex parte application to depose Stein-berg, because it did not constitute a noticed motion. Plaintiff then noticed a motion to take the deposition. As good cause, plaintiff averred that it needed to discover \u201cthe substance of\u2019 Steinberg\u2019s communications with Conder regarding plaintiff, as well as communications between them and others about Conder\u2019s former representation of plaintiff, together with related documents. The motion also stated that the deposition was necessary to prepare for the preliminary injunction hearing, and cited federal cases allowing expedited discovery in that connection. Plaintiff included a proposed notice of deposition, which requested that Steinberg produce a range of documents, including any related to any plans Steinberg or Conder had ever had \u201cto take legislative, regulatory and/or legal action of any kind adverse to [plaintiff],\u201d and any documents regarding \u201cany proposals or arrangements to compensate you for providing assistance to any person(s) in a manner adverse to [plaintiff].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">Opposing the motion, Steinberg argued that plaintiff had not identified additional facts, necessary to establish a prima facie case, which the deposition would elicit. Steinberg added that the document request indicated that plaintiffs discovery effort was directed at obstructing his professional endeavors. He submitted a further declaration, affirming the nonexistence of many of the documents sought. Plaintiff filed a memorandum in rebuttal, discussing certain elements that allegedly would assist it in making a prima facie showing under section 425.16, subdivision (b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">Citing <em>Sipple </em>v. <em>Foundation for Nat. Progress </em>(1999) 71 Cal.App.4th 226 [83 Cal.Rptr.2d 677], the trial court denied the motion, ruling that plaintiff had failed to identify evidence in Steinberg\u2019s possession that would be necessary to oppose the motion to strike.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">1. <em>Free Speech and Petition.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b536-9\">Under section 425.16, subdivision (b)(1), a case or cause of action is subject to challenge by a special motion to strike if it arises from an act by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>the defendant in furtherance of the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights of petition or free speech in connection with a public issue. Plaintiffs first contention is that the trial court erred in ruling that this action arose from acts of that kind, and therefore the motion to strike should have been denied at the threshold. This contention is plainly invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">Subdivision (e) of section 425.16 defines the acts' in furtherance of petition or free speech rights that subdivision (b)(1) contemplates. They include statements made in connection with an issue under consideration by a legislative body (subd. (e)(2)), statements on an issue of public interest made in a place open to the public (subd. (e)(3)), and \u201cany other conduct in furtherance of the exercise of the constitutional right of petition or . . . free speech in connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest\u201d (subd. (e)(4)). Steinberg\u2019s communications with other optometrists and optometric agency representatives, inviting pursuit of prospective legislation concerning mail order contact lens sales, and his discussions of that subject both with Conder and with those representatives in public restaurants, all fall within one or more of these categories. (See, e.g., <em>Briggs </em>v. <em>Eden Council for Hope &amp; Opportunity </em>(1999) 19 Cal.4th 1106, 1115 [81 Cal.Rptr.2d 471, 969 P.2d 564] [communications preparatory to or anticipation of official proceedings come within \u00a7 425.16].)</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">Plaintiff does not dispute the foregoing. Rather, plaintiff contends that Steinberg\u2019s own evidence showed that his communications were not \u201cvalid exercises\u201d of constitutional rights but rather were \u201cunlawful,\u201d as alleged in the complaint. This argument is misplaced.  \u201cPlaintiff[\u2019]s argument \u2018confuses the threshold question of whether the SLAPP statute [potentially] applies with the question whether [an opposing plaintiff] has established a probability of success on the merits.\u2019 [Citation.] [^[] . . . \u2018The Legislature did not intend that in order to invoke the special motion to strike the defendant must first establish her actions are constitutionally protected under the First Amendment as a matter of law.

The corporate plaintiff argued that the case did not come within the statute because the plaintiff \u201cha[d] no First Amendment right to disclose privileged and confidential documents . . . .\u201d <em>(Fox, supra, </em>89 Cal.App.4th at p. 305.) The <em>Fox </em>court rejected this contention, using language that the Supreme Court later adopted, as quoted above, in <em>Navellier v.

Hanyecz </em>(2001) 85 Cal.App.4th 1356 [102 Cal.Rptr.2d 864], That decision explicitly recognized that the validity of the defendant\u2019s acts comes into play in the second stage of the statutory analysis. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1365, 1367.) It held, however, that the defendants, having admitted engaging in <em>illegal </em>campaign contributions (the subject of the suit), had established that their acts had not been in furtherance of their constitutional rights. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1361, 1365-1367.) Unlike <em>Paul for Council, </em>the present case is distinctly not one \u201cin which defendants have effectively conceded the illegal nature of their . . . activities . . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1367.)</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">The trial court correctly found that plaintiffs causes of action arose from acts in furtherance of Steinberg\u2019s rights of petition or free speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">2. <em>Probability of Prevailing.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">The second inquiry before the trial court under section 425.16, subdivision (b)(1) was whether plaintiff established a probability it would prevail in the action. Plaintiff challenges the court\u2019s determination that it did not do so, with respect to either cause of action in the complaint. We first briefly review the standards applicable to this question.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">In order to establish the necessary probability of prevailing, plaintiff was required both to plead claims that were legally sufficient, and to make a prima facie showing, by admissible evidence, of facts that would merit a favorable judgment on those claims, assuming plaintiffs evidence were credited. <em>(Wilson v. Parker, Covert &amp; Chidester </em>(2002) 28 Cal.4th 811, 821 [123 Cal.Rptr.2d 19, 50 P.3d 733]; <em>Wilcox v. Superior Court </em>(1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 809, 823-824, 830 [33 Cal.Rptr.2d 446]; <em>Evans v. Unkow </em>(1995) 38 Cal.App.4th 1490, 1497-1498 [45 Cal.Rptr.2d 624] [disapproving consideration of statements made on information and belief].) This burden is somewhat akin to that required to resist a nonsuit <em>(Wilcox, supra, </em>27 Cal.App.4th at p. 824), or to move for summary judgment. (See <em>Aguilar v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number><em>Atlantic Richfield Co. </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 851-852 [107 Cal.Rptr.2d 841, 24 P.3d 493].)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">When assessing the plaintiffs showing, the court must also consider evidence that the defendant presents. (\u00a7 425.16, subd. (b)(2).) The court does not, however, weigh that evidence against the plaintiffs, in terms of either credibility or persuasiveness. Rather, the defendant\u2019s evidence is considered with a view toward whether it defeats the plaintiffs showing as a matter of law, such as by establishing a defense or the absence of a necessary element. <em>(Wilson </em>v. <em>Parker, Covert &amp; Chidester, supra, </em>28 Cal.4th at p. 821; <em>Kashian v. Harriman </em>(2002) 98 Cal.App.4th 892, 906 [120 Cal.Rptr.2d 576].)</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">Finally, on appeal from an order granting or denying an anti-SLAPP motion, we review de novo the trial court\u2019s determination regarding the plaintiffs\u2019 probability of prevailing. (E.g., <em>Kashian v. Harriman, supra, </em>98 Cal.App.4th at p. 906; <em>Matson </em>v. <em>Dvorak </em>(1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 539, 548 [46 Cal.Rptr.2d 880].)</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">A. <em>Inducing Breach of Contract.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b539-8\">Guided by the foregoing principles, we consider first the cause of action for inducing breach of the agreement.  The elements of this tort\u2014a species of intentional interference with contractual relations\u2014are a valid contract between the plaintiff and a third party, defendant\u2019s knowledge of it, \u201cdefendant\u2019s intentional acts designed to induce a breach ... of the contractual relationship,\u201d consequent breach, and resulting damage. <em>(Quelimane Co. </em>v. <em>Stewart Title Guaranty Co. </em>(1998) 19 Cal.4th 26, 55 [77 Cal.Rptr.2d 709, 960 P.2d 513] <em>(Quelimane).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b539-9\">Plaintiffs unverified complaint summarily alleged that Steinberg had induced Conder to breach the provisions of the agreement with plaintiff by which Conder had agreed not to discuss plaintiffs \u201cconfidential information\u201d without its consent, make public statements regarding various \u201cproprietary information\u201d of plaintiff, or assist persons that derived a majority of their sales from products or services competitive with plaintiffs. The trial court ruled that plaintiff had failed to show a probability of success with respect to the element involving intent to induce a breach of the agreement. The court noted Steinberg\u2019s evidence that Conder had approached him, and summarized the state of the evidence as being that any breach of the agreement by Conder was a product of his own conduct and preexisting intent, not Steinberg\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>Plaintiff argues that the trial court improperly required a showing of \u201cspecific intent\u201d by Steinberg to induce Conder to breach. Rather, plaintiff avers, the necessary intent comprised knowledge that a breach was substantially likely to occur as a result of Steinberg\u2019s actions. Although this restatement of the intent element is generally accurate, it does not dictate a different result.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">In <em>Quelimane, supra, </em>19 Cal.4th at page 56, the Supreme Court approvingly quoted the Restatement Second of Torts\u2019 statement that intentional interference with a contract occurs when the defendant \u201c \u2018knows that the interference is certain or substantially certain to occur as a result of his action. \u2019 \u201d (Accord, <em>Korea Supply Co. v. Lockheed Martin Corp. </em>(2003) 29 Cal.4th 1134, 1155-1156 [131 Cal.Rptr.2d 29, 63 P.3d 937] [intentional interference with prospective economic advantage].)  Plaintiff did not establish a prima facie case that this was so here. The evidence showed that from the commencement of Steinberg\u2019s acquaintance with Conder, and throughout the events addressed by the complaint, Conder repeatedly assured Steinberg that he would not disclose and was not disclosing any confidential information of plaintiff\u2019s, in part because he had signed a confidentiality agreement with plaintiff. Moreover, in Steinberg\u2019s presence, Conder stated and restated his contractual obligation not to work for a defined class of competitors, and obtained assurances that neither Steinberg nor the optometric associations were within that class. Whether or not a breach of the agreement occurred, the evidence did not show or substantiate that Steinberg\u2014either in agreeing to work with Conder on a subject of mutual concern or in inviting or arranging for others interested to meet with them\u2014acted with knowledge that any such breach would thereby be caused. Contrary to plaintiff\u2019s argument, Steinberg\u2019s references to Conder\u2019s experience and knowledge, in e-mails to other optometrists, are insufficient to constitute prima facie proof that Steinberg was acting with knowledge that Conder would violate his agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">There is a second, independent reason why there was no probability of plaintiffs prevailing on this cause of action. The tortious charge against Steinberg was precluded by Civil Code section 47, subdivision (b)(1), the \u201clitigation privilege\u201d as statutorily applicable to legislative proceedings. That privilege applies to claims for inducing breach of contract. <em>(Silberg </em>v. <em>Anderson </em>(1990) 50 Cal.3d 205, 215 [266 Cal.Rptr. 638, 786 P.2d 365].) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>Here, the entire thrust of Steinberg\u2019s activity was to enable the enactment of legislation, by soliciting other interested parties to pursue it, and assisting them with information and expertise. Civil Code section 47, subdivision (b) immunizes this activity from tort liability, much as it did the solicitation of litigation in <em>Rubin v. Green </em>(1993) 4 Cal.4th 1187, 1193-1196 [17 Cal.Rptr.2d 828, 847 P.2d 1044],</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">Plaintiff contests the availability of the privilege on the ground that Conder could not avail himself of either it or the anti-SLAPP law\u2019s free speech protections, because of his agreement with plaintiff not to disclose confidential information. (See <em>Navellier </em>v. <em>Sletten, supra, 29 </em>Cal.4th at p. 94; <em>Paul v. Friedman </em>(2002) 95 Cal.App.4th 853, 869 [117 Cal.Rptr.2d 82].) But as the trial court noted, this case involves Steinberg\u2019s liability, vel non, not Conder\u2019s, and Steinberg never contractually relinquished his own rights, in respect of either lobbying, communication, or for that matter association with Conder. Whether or not Conder committed a breach of contract, the statutory privilege precludes liability on Steinberg\u2019s part.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">Plaintiff offers four further reasons why the litigation (legislation) privilege should not apply. None of them is persuasive. First, plaintiff asserts that Steinberg\u2019s acts included \u201cnoncommunicative conduct,\u201d not embraced by the privilege, such as forming a \u201cjoint venture\u201d with Conder and setting up meetings. But arranging to communicate and setting up meetings are integral parts of conducting meetings, which the Supreme Court has termed \u201cclearly within the scope of the privilege.\u201d <em>(Rubin </em>v. <em>Green, supra, 4 </em>Cal.4th at p. 1195; see <em>id. </em>at pp. 1195-1196.)</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">Second, plaintiff asserts that the privilege does not protect attorneys when they violate ethical rules. The short answer is that Steinberg did not violate any such rules. Although the complaint summarily alleged that he had violated rules 1-120 and 3-210, there was no showing that he had either knowingly assisted in any violation of the rules or the State Bar Act (rule 1-120), or \u201cadvise[d] the violation of any law, rule, or ruling . . . .\u201d (Rule 3-310.)</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">Third, plaintiff argues that the privilege is inapplicable because Stein-berg\u2019s activities were too remote from the actual legislative process: \u201cStein-berg and Conder did not even have so much as a single client for their would-be legislative consulting business at the time of the Las Vegas bar room meetings.\u201d Plaintiff mischaracterizes. Steinberg\u2019s communications with optometric associations concerned both pending legislation and the interest of those associations in pursuing various legislative initiatives. The privilege applies to communications related to anticipated proceedings, if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>actually contemplated in good faith and under serious consideration. <em>(Rubin v. Green, supra, </em>4 Cal.4th at pp. 1194-1195; see <em>Pettitt v. Levy </em>(1972) 28 Cal.App.3d 484, 490-491 [104 Cal.Rptr. 650].)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Here they were so contemplated. That was the essential basis of plaintiffs claim of threatened injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">Finally, plaintiff contends that Steinberg\u2019s and Conder\u2019s references to past and ongoing litigation about mail order contact lenses fell outside the privilege, because they were not \u201cdirectly relevant\u201d to proposed legislation. But the criterion of \u201creasonable relevancy to the subject matter\u201d <em>(Silberg </em>v. <em>Anderson, supra, </em>50 Cal.3d at p. 220) is not that narrow, particularly where the subject matter involves legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">The trial court properly determined that plaintiff had not established a probability it would prevail on the cause of action for inducing breach of contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">B. <em>Breach of Fiduciary Duty.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">Plaintiffs remaining cause of action was for \u201cinducing breach of fiduciary and statutory duties.\u201d Several legal considerations initially frame assessment of this claim and plaintiffs probability of prevailing on it. First, as both plaintiff and the trial court pointed out, the pleading\u2019s title does not correspond to any traditionally denominated California cause of action. However, plaintiff now acknowledges that \u201cThe trial court properly equated [the] claim for inducing breach of fiduciary duty to a claim for conspiracy to breach fiduciary duty.\u201d We shall analyze and treat it as such.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">Second, Conder\u2019s alleged breach of fiduciary duty involved duties under Utah law. As plaintiff stated below, \u201cUtah law governs Conder\u2019s fiduciary and ethical duties because Conder is a Utah lawyer who formed an attorney-client relationship in Utah with [plaintiff], a Utah-based corporation.\u201d Concomitantly, the first cause of action\u2019s only colorable charge against Stein-berg was conspiracy to breach Conder\u2019s fiduciary duties to plaintiff. As previously noted, there was no showing that Steinberg breached California\u2019s rule 1-120 or 3-210. Moreover, those rules do not create a cause of action. (Rule 1-100(A); see <em>Noble </em>v. <em>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. </em>(1973) 33 Cal.App.3d 654, 658 [109 Cal.Rptr. 269, 73 A.L.R.3d 1164].)</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>The same is trae, moreover, of the Utah Rules. Their violation does not per se \u201cgive rise to a cause of action, nor [does] it create any presumption that a legal duty has been breached.\u201d (Utah Rules, Scope; accord, <em>Archuleta v. Hughes </em>(Utah 1998) 969 P.2d 409, 413-414; <em>Kilpatrick v. Wiley, Rein &amp; Fielding </em>(Utah Ct.App. 1996) 909 P.2d 1283, 1291, fn. 3.) In the latter case, the court observed that the Utah Rules \u201care not a basis for civil liability,\u201d and violations of them do not give rise to a cause of action for \u201cmalpractice\u201d based on breach of an attorney\u2019s fiduciary duty. <em>(Kilpatrick, </em>at p. 1291, fn. 3.) This is significant because the complaint delineates the duties that Conder is alleged to have breached by reference to violations of Utah Rules, rules 1.6(a) and 1.9(b), concerning the disclosure and use of information \u201crelating to\u201d a lawyer\u2019s professional representation. (See <em>ante, </em>p. 574.)<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> But while the fiduciary duty of a Utah attorney comprises loyalty and confidentiality (Kilpatrick, <em>supra, </em>909 P.2d at p. 1290), the latter does not necessarily extend to the broad reaches of Utah Rules, rules 1.6(b) and 1.9(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">We need not determine the exact extent, or absence, of Conder\u2019s fiduciary duties vis-a-vis the matters alleged in the complaint. Without regard to any deficiency in this regard, like the trial court we perceive three distinct reasons why plaintiff did not establish a probability of success on the fiduciary duty cause of action against Steinberg.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">First, liability for conspiracy to commit a tort requires that \u201cThe conspiring defendants must. . . have actual knowledge that a tort is planned and concur in the tortious scheme with knowledge of its unlawful purpose. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Kidron v. Movie Acquisition Corp. </em>(1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 1571, 1582 [47 Cal.Rptr.2d 752].) Moreover, \u201cKnowledge of the planned tort must be combined with intent to aid in its commission.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em> Here, however, there was insufficient evidence that Steinberg either knew that Conder was going to breach a fiduciary duty to plaintiff, or intended to assist in such a wrong. Once again, Conder repeatedly assured Steinberg, from the outset of their contact and throughout their discussions in Las Vegas, that he neither intended to nor would reveal any confidences of plaintiff. And plaintiffs declarations do not refute Conder\u2019s avowal that he limited his statements in Las Vegas to matters publicly known (cf. Utah Rules, rule 1.9(b)). The evidence does not support a finding that Steinberg was aware that confidential information would be disclosed, or knowingly acted to further such a disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>Plaintiffs arguments to the contrary are unavailing. Plaintiff avers that Steinberg must have become aware that Conder was disclosing confidential attorney-client information, at least by the conclusion of the first meeting with optometrists in the Las Vegas bar. But this assertion begs the basic question, that Steinberg knew that Conder\u2019s statements involved confidential information. Second, that Steinberg knew and informed others that Conder had been counsel for a mail order business, and was knowledgeable in the legislative area, also does not imply that Steinberg was engaged in peddling Conder\u2019s confidential information. In particular, Steinberg\u2019s e-mail reference to Conder\u2019s knowing \u201cthe strategies of the mail order companies\u201d (italics added) did not, necessarily or distinctly, refer to confidential or privileged information of plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">Finally, plaintiff contends that the intent of Steinberg and Conder\u2019s undertaking, to assist optometrists in procuring legislation regarding mail-order contact lenses, necessarily involved Conder\u2019s violating Utah Rules, rule 1.9(a) (see <em>ante, </em>fn. 16). But, apart from the questions of whether the requirements of that rule comprise part of an attorney\u2019s fiduciary duty under Utah law (cf. <em>American Airlines, Inc. v. Sheppard, Mullin, Richter &amp; Hampton </em>(2002) 96 Cal.App.4th 1017, 1032 [117 Cal.Rptr.2d 685]), and whether and how they apply to counseling about legislation, plaintiff has not shown that any particular activity that occurred here violated the rule. For the facts presented did not show that Conder had achieved any new client representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">The second reason why there was no probability of plaintiffs prevailing on its first cause of action is that the fiduciary duties it alleged Steinberg had conspired to breach were duties that he did not owe to plaintiff. The allegedly violated duties were Conder\u2019s. They arose\u2014under Utah law (see <em>ante, </em>p. 588)\u2014from Conder\u2019s status as plaintiffs attorney. But Steinberg never occupied such a position. Indeed, his prior professional posture as a California attorney had been directly adverse to plaintiff. Given this absence of any fiduciary duty owed plaintiff by Steinberg, and that the object of the alleged conspiracy was a breach of Conder\u2019s fiduciary duty, Steinberg could not as a matter of law have been liable for conspiracy to breach that duty.  Conspiracy is not an independent cause of action, but rather a doctrine imposing liability for a tort upon those involved in its commission. <em>(Applied Equipment Corp </em>v. <em>Litton Saudi Arabia, Ltd. </em>(1994) 7 Cal.4th 503, 510-511 [28 Cal.Rptr.2d 475, 869 P.2d 454] <em>(Applied Equipment). </em>And \u201ctort liability arising from conspiracy presupposes that the coconspirator is legally capable of committing the tort, i.e., that he or she owes a duty to plaintiff . . . and is potentially subject to liability for breach of that duty.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 511.)</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">Plaintiff acknowledges this general obstacle to imposing conspiratorial liability on Steinberg for a tort he was legally incapable of committing. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>But plaintiff propounds a supposed qualification. As plaintiff summarizes in its reply brief: \u201c[Although the general rule is that a cause of action for inducing breach of fiduciary duty will not lie if the defendant did not independently owe fidiciary duties to the plaintiff, there is an exception to the general rule where the defendant acted for the defendant\u2019s \u2018own financial gain or advantage,\u2019 and not as the mere agent or employee of the fiduciary.\u201d Here, plaintiff continues, Steinberg acted for personal gain, because his purpose in joining with Conder was to undertake a profitable legislative consulting business.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">Plaintiffs attribution of a \u201cpersonal gain or advantage\u201d exception to the bar against liability for conspiracy to breach a legal duty that is not binding on the defendant involves a misapprehension of relevant Supreme Court authority. In <em>Doctors' Co. v. Superior Court </em>(1989) 49 Cal.3d 39 [260 Cal.Rptr. 183, 775 P.2d 508] <em>(Doctors' Co.), </em>on which plaintiff relies, the court held that attorneys and an expert engaged by an insurance company could not be liable for conspiring with it to violate Insurance Code section 790.03, which prescribes and proscribes certain unfair practices by insurers. After recognizing that the noninsurer defendants were not bound by the statutory duties allegedly breached, the court observed that \u201cA cause of action for civil conspiracy may not arise ... if the alleged conspirator, though a participant in the agreement underlying the injury, was not personally bound by the duty violated by the wrongdoing and was acting only as the agent or employee of the party who did have that duty.\u201d <em>(Doctors' Co., supra, </em>49 Cal.3d at p. 44.)</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">With respect to the latter qualification, the court cited the rule that agents and employees cannot conspire with their principal or employer where they act on its behalf, \u201c \u2018and not as individuals for their individual advantage.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Doctors' Co., supra, </em>49 Cal.3d at p. 45.) The court then stated that \u201cBecause the noninsurer defendants are not subject to th[e] duty and were acting merely as agents of the insurer \u2018and not as individuals for their individual advantage\u2019 [citation], \u2018they, cannot be held accountable on a theory of conspiracy.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>However, the court added, agents could be subject to \u201cconspiracy liability for conduct which the agents carry out \u2018as individuals for their individual advantage\u2019 and not solely on behalf of the principal [citation].\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 47.) In other words, an agent may be held liable if it conspires to commit a tort for its own personal advantage or gain, rather than simply on behalf of and for the benefit of its principal or employer. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 46-47.)</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">Plaintiff reads <em>Doctors' Co., supra, </em>49 Cal.3d 39, as recognizing an \u201cindividual advantage\u201d exception, not only to the immunity of agents from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>liability for conspiring with their employers, but also to the rule that a defendant, agent or otherwise, cannot actionably conspire to breach a duty to which it is not subject. Such a construction, however, was refuted by <em>Applied Equipment, supra, </em>7 Cal.4th 503, which plaintiff does not cite.  <em>Applied Equipment </em>repudiated the concept that a party to a contract could be liable for conspiracy to interfere tortiously with that contract. A primary rationale for the decision was that one cannot be liable for conspiracy if one is legally incapable of committing the underlying tort. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 510; see <em>id. </em>at pp. 511-514.) In reiterating that rule, the <em>Applied Equipment </em>court noted that <em>Doctor's Co., </em>and another Supreme Court case on which it had relied,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> were based on \u201ctwo independent principles,\u201d namely that (1) parties not subject to a duty cannot be liable for conspiracy to breach it, and (2) \u201cduly acting agents and employees cannot be held liable for conspiring with their own principals (the \u2018agent\u2019s immunity rule\u2019).\u201d <em>(Applied Equipment, supra, </em>at p. 512.) But the exception for conduct undertaken in pursuit of a personal interest or advantage applies only to the agent\u2019s immunity rule. It does not relax the requirement that to be liable for conspiracy to breach a duty, the defendant must be bound by that duty and capable of breaching it. (See <em>id. </em>at pp. 512-513.)</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">This understanding of the relevant principles and authorities was recently expounded by Division One of this court in <em>Everest Investors 8 </em>v. <em>Whitehall Real Estate Limited Partnership XI </em>(2002) 100 Cal.App.4th 1102, 1106-1109 [123 Cal.Rptr.2d 297] <em>(Everest Investors). Everest Investors </em>also noted that certain decisions in the trust area (some of which plaintiff here cites) espouse the contrary understanding, that a nonfiduciary may conspire to breach another\u2019s fiduciary duty, if the nonfiduciary acts for personal gain or advantage. We find this position at odds with <em>Applied Equipment, supra, </em>7 Cal.4th 503. Moreover, it does not logically follow. An exception to the agent\u2019s immunity, for conduct undertaken for personal advantage, is consistent with the immunity rule, because pursuit of a personal interest renders the actor more than merely the agent of another. But there is no such theoretical rationale for pursuit of a personal advantage creating liability for conspiracy to breach a duty that the defendant cannot itself breach. (See <em>Everest Investors, supra, </em>100 Cal.App.4th at p. 1109.) And practically, to impose such an exception would effectively swallow up the rule, because personal interest or advantage is generally the impetus or goal of conspiratorial conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">Breach of fiduciary duty is a tort that by definition may be committed by only a limited class of persons. (Cf. <em>Doctor's Co., supra, </em>49 Cal.3d at p. 48.) In the case of Conder\u2019s fiduciary duty to plaintiff as its former <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>attorney, that class did not include Steinberg. Plaintiffs effort to hold him nevertheless liable for Conder\u2019s alleged breach through the doctrine of conspiracy was legally unauthorized.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">Finally, a third reason why plaintiffs fiduciary duty cause of action did not carry a probability of prevailing is that the privilege of Civil Code section 47, subdivision (b)(1) applied. As discussed above with respect to the second cause of action, that privilege excluded liability by Steinberg for his activities in pursuit of regulatory legislation. We have already reviewed and rejected plaintiffs objections to this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the trial court\u2019s ruling that plaintiff had not shown a probability of prevailing on its cause of action for conspiracy to breach fiduciary duty was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">3. <em>Steinberg\u2019s Deposition.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">The remaining issue is whether the denial of plaintiffs motion to take Steinberg\u2019s deposition before decision of the motion to strike was error, warranting reversal of the order granting the latter motion. As plaintiff acknowledges, an order denying a motion to permit discovery, notwithstanding section 425.16, subdivision (g)\u2019s general discovery stay, is subject to review for abuse of discretion. (See <em>Sipple v. Foundation for Nat. Progress, supra, </em>71 Cal.App.4th 226, 247 <em>(Sipple).) </em>For the following reasons, we conclude that no such abuse occurred here.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b547-9\">Section 425.16, subdivision (g) allows the court to permit specified discovery \u201cfor good cause shown\u201d on noticed motion. Decisions that have considered what constitutes such a showing of good cause have described it as a showing \u201cthat a defendant or witness possesses evidence needed by plaintiff to establish a prima facie case.\u201d <em>(Lafayette Morehouse, supra, </em>37 Cal.App.4th at p. 868.) The showing should include some explanation of \u201cwhat additional facts [plaintiff] expects to uncover . . . .\u201d <em>(Sipple, supra, </em>71 Cal.App.4th at p. 247; see also <em>Nicosia v. De Rooy </em>(N.D.Cal. 1999) 72 F.Supp.2d 1093, 1111.) Only in these circumstances is the discretion under section 425.16, subdivision (g) to be \u201cliberally exercise[d].\u201d <em>(Lafayette Morehouse, supra, </em>37 Cal.App.4th at p. 868.) Discovery may not be obtained merely to \u201ctest\u201d the opponent\u2019s declarations. <em>(Sipple, supra, </em>71 Cal.App.4th at p. 247.)</p>\n<p id=\"b548-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>The trial court ruled that plaintiff had not made showing of this nature. Plaintiff disagrees, and cites a list of elements that its reply papers stated would be subjects of discovery. But as Steinberg pointed out below, the information that had already been adduced covered this ground, and established the scenario and basic elements of the case. And contrary to its present assertions, plaintiff did not in its papers below include the element that \u201c \u2018Steinberg intended to induce Conder to breach his contract.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">The request for discovery that plaintiff presented exceeded the contemplation of section 425.15, subdivision (g) in other respects. Plaintiff expressly sought to take Steinberg\u2019s deposition so as to prepare not only for the motion to strike but also for the motion for preliminary injunction, by which plaintiff sought to enjoin Steinberg from representing or assisting optometrists regarding mail order contact lens regulation, with or without Conder or plaintiff\u2019s confidential information. And to that end, the notice of deposition extended to documents beyond the elements of a prima facie case.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">Under these circumstances, the denial of plaintiffs motion to depose Steinberg cannot be deemed an abuse of discretion. Moreover, the ruling could not have constituted reversible error in any event. As we have held, under plaintiffs allegations and undisputed facts, the claims against Stein-berg, whatever their factual basis, were legally untenable, by reason of Civil Code section 47, subdivision (b), and the preclusion of conspiratorial liability for breach of an inapplicable duty. A deposition of Steinberg could not have changed that.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">The order granting the motion to strike the complaint is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">Rubin, J., and Boland, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-9\">Appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied July 9, 2003.

The notice of appeal also refers to a \u201cresulting judgment\u201d and certain discovery orders \u201csubsumed therein.\u201d But the record does not contain a judgment, and plaintiff has informed us that none was entered. The discovery orders are not independently appealable, but we will review them under section 906.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b527-9\">Steinberg later elaborated in a declaration that this suit was brought under Business and Professions Code section 17200, and the settlement required plaintiff to verify the currency of a customer\u2019s prescription with its issuer. Steinberg further described instances in which plaintiff did not comply with this requirement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b528-6\">The subjects addressed allegedly included (1) plaintiffs legal analysis of state laws governing sale of contact lenses, their perceived loopholes, and plaintiffs legal and other strategies and perceived vulnerabilities with respect to them; (2) legislative efforts by plaintiff in various states, including plaintiffs strategies, vulnerabilities, and expenditures; (3) information Conder learned while representing plaintiff in litigation, as well as about other pending federal litigation; and (4) accusations by licensing boards, and plaintiffs strategies and practices concerning them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b530-7\">The e-mails quoted herein, and others, were attached to Steinberg\u2019s declaration.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b532-7\">That agreement also provided that Steinberg would not file any more complaints or claims against plaintiff, except to enforce the settlement, or incite or assist others to do so.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b532-8\">Plaintiff filed a responsive declaration by Nichols, who denied giving Conder such an opinion or advice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b532-9\">Steinberg declared that Conder had learned of this suit only from him.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b533-9\">Conder noted that \u201cessentially identical\u201d declarations had been filed in plaintiff\u2019s Utah action against him.

(3) Conder \u201calso disclosed information he had learned while representing [plaintiff] in various litigation matters, including lawsuits in California and Texas. He also spoke about multi-district litigation pending in Florida . . . and ongoing disputes between [plaintiff] and Johnson &amp; Johnson . . . .\u201d (4) \u201cMr. Conder also spoke about certain confidential communications between [plaintiff] and state officials, including communications with representatives of the California Attorney General\u2019s Office.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b535-8\">The court added three further observations. First, it stated that the case appeared to involve no more than \u201ca legitimate dispute between plaintiff and Conder over the release and/or disclosure of allegedly confidential information.\u201d Steinberg, not a party to the agreement, would not be subject to the exception to the litigation privilege for breach of a trade secrets agreement. Second, the court opined that actions such as the present one could disrupt access to the legislative process, and have a \u201cdampening effect on the unobstructed presentation of claims . . . .\u201d Finally, the court stated that even had plaintiff established a prima facie case of inducing breach of fiduciary duty, which was an unrecognized cause of action but tantamount to conspiracy to breach a fiduciary duty, Steinberg could legally not be liable for such a conspiracy because he owed no fiduciary duty to plaintiff.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b536-10\">The preliminary injunction motion was taken off calendar when the motion to strike was granted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b539-10\">The required showing has been termed one of \u201cminimal merit.\u201d <em>(Navellier </em>v. <em>Sletten, supra, </em>29 Cal.4th at pp. 89, 95 &amp; fn. 11.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b540-6\">Regardless of the precise intent required, plaintiff's complaint arguably was legally insufficient as to this element.

Lyman </em>(1991) 1 Cal.App.4th 1093, 1102-1105 [3 Cal.Rptr.2d 236]). These decisions refer also to liability for conspiracy (e.g., <em>id. </em>at p. 1104), which suitably describes the gist of plaintiffs present cause of action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b543-7\">The complaint does not specifically cite Utah Rules, rule 1.9(a), which prohibits an attorney who formerly represented a client in a matter from representing, without the consent of that former client, another person in the same or a factually related matter in which the person\u2019s interests are materially adverse to those of the former client.
