J.</author>\n<p id=\"AkQ\">Penal Code section 1381.5 requires the district attorney to bring a defendant imprisoned in a federal correctional institution to trial or for sentencing in state criminal proceedings within 90 days after receiving an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>assent from an authorized federal official for the release of the defendant from federal custody for that purpose. If the defendant is not brought to trial or for sentencing as required by section 1381.5,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the trial court must, on motion, \u201cdismiss the action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">Although as a formal matter, if the trial court at a sentencing hearing suspends imposition of sentence and places the defendant on probation, the defendant has not yet been sentenced, we hold section 1381.5 applies only to defendants who have not been tried or afforded an initial sentencing hearing following conviction, not probationers awaiting a probation revocation hearing. Accordingly, we affirm the trial court\u2019s denial of Katherine M. Broughton\u2019s motion to dismiss the criminal actions against her notwithstanding the district attorney\u2019s failure to comply with the procedural requirements of section 1381.5 following Broughton\u2019s demand for a \u201cspeedy trial\u201d of her probation revocation hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">Factual and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">1. <em>The State Actions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">On September 14, 1998, Broughton pleaded guilty to possession of rock cocaine (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11350, subd. (a)) and was placed on diversion for 18 months (\u00a7 1000.2) under specified terms and conditions. On December 18, 1998, Broughton pleaded guilty to transportation of marijuana (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11360, subd. (a).) Diversion in the first matter was terminated, and the two cases were scheduled for sentencing. On January 19, 1999, the trial court suspended imposition of sentence in both cases and placed Broughton on three years\u2019 felony supervised probation with certain terms and conditions, including the condition she serve 210 days in county jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-9\">2. <em>The Federal Case</em></p>\n<p id=\"b273-10\">On October 2, 1999, Broughton was sentenced to 30 months in a federal correctional facility. The record does not identify the federal charges for which she was tried or convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-11\">3. <em>The First Probation Violation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b273-12\">On January 19, 2001, Broughton appeared in the state trial court and admitted (and the court found true) that she had violated the terms of her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>probation by deserting probation in both state cases.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The trial court revoked probation, then reinstated it in both cases with the condition that she serve an additional one year in county jail. Probation was to terminate upon her release from jail. Pursuant to Broughton\u2019s request, the court stayed the county jail condition of probation until January 31, 2001, and ordered Broughton to surrender on that date. Broughton did not inform the court of her federal sentence or otherwise indicate an inability to surrender herself for custody.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">4. <em>The Second Probation Violation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">On January 31, 2001, Broughton failed to surrender as ordered. Instead, the program director of a federal parole center informed the trial court that Broughton was in federal custody and had approximately five months left on her 30-month federal sentence. The trial court revoked probation and issued a bench warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">5. <em>The Section 1381.5 Demand for a \u201cSpeedy Trial\u201d in the State Cases</em></p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">On April 13, 2001, while incarcerated in a federal correctional facility, Broughton filed in the state trial court an in propria persona \u201cMotion for Speedy Trial or Speedy Disposition of Warrant(s)\u201d under section 1381.5 (April motion).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Broughton demanded a \u201cspeedy trial\u201d \u201con all actions pending against her\u201d in the state jurisdiction. The April motion stated Broughton <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>was scheduled to be released from the Federal Correctional Institution, Dublin, on December 4, 2001. The trial court placed the motion in Broughton\u2019s case file and took no further action. There is no evidence the motion was served on the district attorney or Broughton\u2019s probation officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">On October 4, 2001, the district attorney\u2019s office received a section 1381.5 \u201cspeedy trial\u201d demand from Broughton (October demand). This demand listed Broughton\u2019s projected release date only as \u201c4, 2002,\u201d omitting the month. Following receipt of the October demand the district attorney\u2019s office did not inquire of the head of the federal correctional institution in which Broughton was confined whether and when Broughton could be released for sentencing in the state matters, as required by section 1381.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">Broughton was released from federal custody on January 8, 2002. On January 18, 2002, Broughton appeared in the state court and moved to quash the bench warrant issued on January 31, 2001, and to dismiss both state cases on the ground the district attorney failed to take any action on her section 1381.5 demand. The trial court dismissed the bench warrant and probation violation associated with her failure to surrender but denied Broughton\u2019s motion to dismiss the entire action, finding that Broughton had not been prejudiced by the district attorney\u2019s inaction. The court reinstated the previous order of probation with the condition Broughton serve one year in county jail. Probation was to terminate upon her release from custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\"> Broughton obtained a certificate of probable cause (\u00a7 1237.5)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> .and filed a timely notice of appeal from the orders granting probation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">Contention</p>\n<p id=\"b275-9\">Broughton contends section 1381.5 requires dismissal of an action if the district attorney fails to act on a demand for a \u201cspeedy trial\u201d by a probationer awaiting a probation revocation hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-10\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b275-11\">Section 1381.5 permits federal prisoners with pending criminal proceedings in state court to request to be brought to trial or for sentencing in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>state action. Upon receipt of a request of defendant for trial or sentencing, the district attorney \u201cshall promptly inquire\u201d of the warden of the federal correctional institution housing the defendant \u201cwhether and when such defendant can be released for trial or sentencing\u201d in the pending state matter. (\u00a7 1381.5.) The People must bring the defendant to trial or for sentencing within 90 days of receiving an assent from the federal authorities for defendant\u2019s release for trial or sentencing in the state matter. \u201cIf [the] defendant is not brought to trial or for sentencing as provided [in section 1381.5], the court in which the action is pending shall, on motion or suggestion of the . . . defendant or his counsel, dismiss the action.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">In a closely analogous situation involving section 1203.2a,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the Supreme Court held that dismissal of a criminal action was mandatory, without any showing of prejudice, if a probation officer failed to comply with the statute\u2019s procedural requirements, intended to permit a probationer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>who has been incarcerated on another offense to request immediate imposition of sentence by the probationary court. <em>(In re Hoddinott </em>(1996) 12 Cal.4th 992, 1005 [50 Cal.Rptr.2d 706, 911 P.2d 1381] <em>(Hoddinott).) </em>Although not citing <em>Hoddinott, </em>Broughton urges us to adopt a similar construction of section 1381.5, compelling dismissal of the underlying criminal action whenever the district attorney fails to comply with the section\u2019s mandate that he or she promptly inquire whether the defendant can be released for trial or sentencing.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>\n                   Before we may address Broughton\u2019s contention, however, we must determine whether section 1381.5 is available to probationers as to whom imposition of sentence was suspended when probation was granted at the initial sentencing hearing.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\"> The handful of Courts of Appeal that have considered this issue have concluded, most often in dicta, that section 1381.5, along with its companion statute section 1381,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> is applicable to probationers as to whom impositions of sentence was suspended because they \u201cremain to be sentenced\u201d in a pending criminal proceeding. (See, e.g., <em>Rudman v. Superior Court </em>(1973) 36 Cal.App.3d 22, 26-27 [111 Cal.Rptr. 249] <em>(Rudman); Boles v. Superior Court </em>(1974) 37 Cal.App.3d 479, 484 [112 Cal.Rptr. 286]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Johnson </em>(1987) 195 Cal.App.3d 510, 514 [240 Cal.Rptr. 748], disapproved on another ground in <em>Hoddinott, supra, </em>12 Cal.4th at p. 1005.)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Those decisions, however, have employed an overly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>technical interpretation of sections 1381 and 1381.5 that is inconsistent with the statutes\u2019 overall language and purpose and leads to anomalous consequences.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">1. <em>Section 1381.5 Does Not Apply to Incarcerated Probationers Awaiting a Probation Revocation Hearing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">In this case we must determine whether section 1381.5 applies to an individual who has been tried and convicted and who then appeared at a timely initial sentencing hearing at which imposition of sentence was suspended when the court placed the defendant on probation. Specifically, is such an individual when facing a probation revocation hearing a defendant who \u201cremains to be sentenced\u201d and thus entitled to be \u201cbrought ... for sentencing\u201d within the time constraints of section 1381.5, with the consequence of the failure to do so dismissal of the underlying conviction?</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">In approaching this task we are guided by well-established principles of statutory interpretation: \u201cThe fundamental purpose of statutory construction is to ascertain the intent of the lawmakers so as to effectuate the purpose of the law. [Citations.] In order to determine this intent, we begin by examining the language of the statute. [Citations.] But \u2018[i]t is a settled principle of statutory interpretation that language of a statute should not be given a literal meaning if doing so would result in absurd consequences which the Legislature did not intend.\u2019 [Citations.] Thus, \u2018[t]he intent prevails over the letter, and the letter will, if possible, be so read as to conform to the spirit of the act.\u2019 [Citation.] Finally, we do not construe statutes in isolation, but rather read every statute \u2018with reference to the entire scheme of law of which it is part so that the whole may be harmonized and retain effectiveness.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v. Pieters </em>(1991) 52 Cal.3d 894, 898-899 [276 Cal.Rptr. 918, 802 P.2d 420].)</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">The plain meaning of the actual words used in section 1381.5 manifests the Legislature\u2019s intent to provide a speedy trial right to persons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>awaiting trial or an initial sentencing hearing, not those facing probation revocation hearings. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Loeun </em>(1997) 17 Cal.4th 1, 9 [69 Cal.Rptr.2d 776, 947 P.2d 1313] [\u201c\u2018In interpreting statutes, we follow the Legislature\u2019s intent, as exhibited by the plain meaning of the actual words of the law . . . .\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Farell </em>(2002) 28 Cal.4th 381, 386 [121 Cal.Rptr.2d 603, 48 P.3d 1155] [best indication of legislative intent appears in the language of the enactment].)</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">The requirement that a defendant be brought to court \u201cfor sentencing\u201d does not usually connote an appearance for a probation revocation hearing at which the court may find no violation occurred or, notwithstanding a violation, may continue probation on the same or modified terms. In fact, a defendant who has been placed on probation has already been brought before the court \u201cfor sentencing,\u201d fulfilling the mandate of the statute, although imposition of sentence has been suspended with the grant of probation. If the purpose of section 1381.5 were to ensure a prompt probation revocation hearing, moreover, there would be no need to distinguish between probationers for whom execution of sentence was suspended and those for whom imposition of sentence was suspended, nor would there be any reason to require dismissal of the entire action, rather than simply the probation violation charge, as the sanction for violation of the statute\u2019s time requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">When interpreting a statute, \u201c \u2018 \u201c[w]ords must be construed in context, and statutes must be harmonized, both internally and with each other, to the extent possible.\u201d [Citation.] Interpretations that lead to absurd results or render words surplusage are to be avoided. [Citation.]\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v. Loeun, supra, </em>17 Cal.4th at p. 9.)  If sections 1381 and 1381.5 were to apply to probation revocation hearings, the \u201caction,\u201d not the pending proceeding, must be dismissed if the defendant is not brought to the hearing in the manner prescribed by those sections. Such a dismissal would lead to the peculiar result that a probationer could have a conviction dismissed under a \u201cspeedy trial\u201d statute months or even years after the conclusion of his or her trial and appearance at a timely sentencing hearing at which imposition of sentence was waived in favor of probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">In tacit recognition that such a result could not have been intended by the Legislature, in the only case to actually apply section 1381.5 or section 1381 to an incarcerated defendant facing a probation violation hearing, <em>Rudman, supra, </em>36 Cal.App.3d 22, the court simply ignored the express statutory command to dismiss \u201cthe action\u201d and, without any analysis or explanation, directed the trial court to dismiss only the probation violation charge. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 27-28.) A far more reasonable construction of the statute is to limit its application to defendants awaiting an initial sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>2. <em>Section 1381.5 Is a Codification of the Constitutional Right to</em></p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">\n<em>\u201cSpeedy Trial \u201d as Applied to Incarcerated Persons</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">The history of the 1971 amendments to section 1381.5, which added the language we construe in this case, confirms the Legislature\u2019s purpose to expand the speedy trial right of individuals in custody facing new charges to include prisoners who had been tried and convicted but were still awaiting entry of judgment or other final appealable order\u2014that is, those defendants who had not yet been heard at an <em>initial </em>sentencing hearing. When first enacted in 1963, section 1381.5 provided individuals in federal custody with a procedure to obtain a speedy trial on any pending \u201cindictment, information, or complaint charging such defendant with the commission of a crime . . . .\u201d (Stats. 1963 ch. 1567, \u00a7 1, p. 3151.)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> A similar right was afforded to state prisoners under section 1381. (Stats. 1933, ch. 650, \u00a7 1, p. 1689.) Under both statutes the People\u2019s failure to bring the defendant \u201cto trial\u201d as prescribed required the court to dismiss \u201cthe charge.\u201d (Stats. 1933, ch. 650, \u00a7 1, p. 1689 [\u00a7 1381]; Stats. 1963, ch. 1567, \u00a7 1, p. 3151 [\u00a7 1381.5].)</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">Former sections 1381.5 and 1381 were enacted in recognition that the right to a speedy trial extends to all individuals, including convicts. <em>(Barker </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1966) 64 Cal.2d 806, 813 [51 Cal.Rptr. 921, 415 P.2d 809] <em>(Barker).) </em>As the Supreme Court explained, the guarantee of a speedy trial, whether secured by the Constitution or by statute, \u201c \u2018serves a three-fold purpose. It protects the accused . . . against prolonged imprisonment; it relieves him of the anxiety and public suspicion attendant upon an untried accusation of crime; and ... it prevents him from being \u201cexposed to the hazard of a trial, after so great a lapse of time\u201d that \u201cthe means of proving his innocence may not be within his reach\u201d\u2014as, for instance, by the loss of witnesses or the dulling of memory.\u2019 [Citations.] [ft The foregoing purposes are equally served with respect to one already imprisoned for another crime. Even the purpose of preventing undue imprisonment is of some concern to a California prisoner, because if he is promptly convicted of an additional offense he may be sentenced to serve a term of imprisonment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>concurrently with the term already imposed (Pen. Code, \u00a7 669); if a defendant is brought to trial only after his sentence on another charge has been completed, the possibility of concurrent sentences is denied him.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">In 1968, in <em>People </em>v. <em>Brown, supra, </em>260 Cal.App.2d at page 751 <em>(Brown), </em>the Court of Appeal confronted the question whether former section 1381.5 applied to a defendant who had been convicted, but, because he was in federal custody, had not appeared at his initial sentencing hearing. Relying on <em>Barker's </em>statement of the purposes for a speedy trial statute, the court held the term \u201c \u2018brought to trial\u2019 \u201d in former section 1381.5 had to include all aspects of the prosecution through \u201cthe entry of a judgment or other final, appealable order. The imposition of sentence is an essential part of the speedy trial guaranteed to all accused.\u201d <em>(Brown, </em>at pp. 750-751.) Accordingly, the court held the district attorney\u2019s delay in inquiring of federal authorities whether and when defendant could be released from federal custody for'his sentencing in the state case violated the directive of section 1381.5 and required the trial court to dismiss the action. <em>(Brown, </em>at pp. 750-751.)</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">In 1971 the Legislature amended sections 1381.5 and 1381 to extend the right to a \u201cspeedy trial\u201d to prisoners against whom \u201cthere is pending in any court of this state . . . any criminal proceeding wherein the <em>defendant remains to be </em>sentenced.....\u201d (Italics added.) The sanction for violating the statute was also changed from dismissal of the \u201ccharge\u201d to dismissal of the \u201caction.\u201d (Stats. 1971, ch. 1556, \u00a7 2, p. 3080 [\u00a7 1381.5]; Stats. 1971, ch 1556, \u00a7 1, p. 3078 [\u00a7 1381].) In expanding the \u201cspeedy trial\u201d right from individuals awaiting trial to include those awaiting sentencing, the Legislature intended to \u201cconform[] Section 1381.5 to th[e] decision\u201d in <em>Brown, supra, </em>260 Cal.App.2d 745 and thereby \u201c[pjromote the speedy disposition of pending sentencings for defendants imprisoned in this state or in a federal correctional institution.\u201d (Sen. Com. on Judiciary, com. on Sen. Bill No. 1508 (1971 Reg. Sess.) as introduced, p. 2.)</p>\n<p id=\"b281-9\">The fundamental policies advanced by speedy trial statutes such as section 1381.5\u2014avoiding prolonged imprisonment, limiting anxiety attendant to an unresolved criminal charge, reducing the effect of lapse of time on trial witnesses and providing the opportunity for imposition of concurrent sentence\u2014apply to defendants who have not been afforded a sentencing hearing, as well as to defendants who have not yet been tried. (See, e.g., <em>Brown, supra, </em>260 Cal.App.2d 745.)  Those policies are not similarly implicated, however, by the timing of a sentencing hearing following revocation of probation for a probationer whose case has been prosecuted to a conviction and who accepted probation at a timely sentencing hearing in lieu <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>of speedy imposition of sentence.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark>\n                   Unlike a defendant who has not appeared at an initial sentencing hearing, a probationer is not languishing pending a \u201cfinal judgment\u201d; his case has been prosecuted to a \u201cfinal judgment.\u201d (See \u00a7 1237 [order granting probation is \u201ca final judgment\u201d for purposes of appeal].) Indeed, a probationer who waives speedy imposition of sentence in lieu of probation is no different from any other defendant who, faced with the opportunity for a speedy trial, nonetheless expressly waives it in lieu of some perceived benefit, whether that benefit is the time to prepare for trial or, as in this case, the clemency of probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">3. <em>Probationers May Seek Concurrent Sentences by Using the Procedure Set Forth in Section 1203.2a</em></p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">Our conclusion that section 1381.5 is not applicable to probation revocation hearings is reinforced by the fact that the Legislature has provided a procedure by which state probationers incarcerated on another fnatter, like Broughton, may seek a concurrent prison term from the probationary court. Pursuant to section 1203.2a, a defendant who has been placed on probation and is thereafter incarcerated for another offense may request imposition of sentence or some other final order terminating the probationary court\u2019s jurisdiction.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> (\u00a7 1203.2a; <em>Hoddinott, supra, </em>12 Cal.4th at p. 1000; but cf. <em>Rudman, supra, </em>36 Cal.App.3d at p. 27 [\u00a7\u00a7 1381.5 and 1203.2a do not conflict; an \u201cunsentenced probationer\u201d has the option to employ either section].)</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">The purpose of section 1203.2a is to provide a mechanism advising the probationary court of the subsequent confinement, thereby permitting the probationary court to consider imposing a concurrent sentence if that is the court\u2019s decision. (Hoddinott, <em>supra, </em>12 Cal.4th at p. 999; <em>In re White </em>(1969) 1 Cal.3d 207, 211 [81 Cal.Rptr. 780, 460 P.2d 980].) Although the opportunity for concurrent sentences is one of the factors supporting a \u201cspeedy trial\u201d right for convicts <em>(Barker, supra, </em>64 Cal.2d at p. 813), and certainly the main factor underlying section 1203.2a <em>(Hoddinott, supra, </em>12 Cal.4th at p. 999; <em>Hayes v. Superior Court </em>(1971) 6 Cal.3d 216, 220 [98 Cal.Rptr. 449, 490 P.2d 1137]), section 1203.2a is not a speedy trial statute. Rather, section 1203.2a is a legislative recognition that the probationary court may inadvertently deny the probationer an opportunity for a concurrent sentence if not made aware of the probationer\u2019s incarceration. As such, section 1203.2a is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>corollary to section 669, directing the trial court to determine whether terms of imprisonment are to run concurrently or consecutively and providing that terms are to run concurrently if the trial court fails to make the required determination. <em>(In re White, supra, </em>1 Cal.3d at p. 211.)</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">4. <em>Viewing Sections 1381.5 and 1203.2a in the Context of the Statutory Schemes of Which They Are Part Further Demonstrates Section 1381.5 Was Not Intended to Apply to Probationers, Regardless of Whether Imposition or Execution of Sentence Was Suspended at the Initial Sentencing Hearing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b283-10\">The differences between sections 1203.2a and 1381.5 and when and to whom they are to be applied are underscored by their respective locations within the Penal Code. (See <em>People v. Pieters, supra, </em>52 Cal.3d at p. 899 [\u201c[W]e do not construe statutes in isolation, but rather . . . \u2018with reference to the entire scheme of law of which it is [a] part so that the whole may be harmonized and retain effectiveness.\u2019 \u201d].) Section 1381.5, appearing in a chapter entitled \u201cDismissal of the Action for Want of Prosecution or Otherwise,\u201d is part of a statutory scheme contemplating dismissal of the action <em>prior to </em>the completion of the prosecution with an initial sentencing hearing. (See, e.g., \u00a7\u00a7 1382 [dismissal of action for failure to file information or bring case to trial within time limit]; 1385 [dismissal of action, cause of action or charge in \u201cfurtherance of justice\u201d either prior to or at sentencing hearing].) Section 1203.2a, in contrast, appearing in a chapter entitled \u201cJudgment and Execution,\u201d expressly applies, along with every other statute in that statutory scheme, <em>after </em>a conviction and an initial sentencing hearing.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b283-11\">Section 1381.5 also must be read in conjunction with section 1387, which, appearing in the same chapter of the Penal Code, permits the People to refile an action dismissed under section 1381.5. (\u00a7 1387<footnotemark>17</footnotemark>; <em>Crockett v. Superior Court </em>(1975) 14 Cal.3d 433, 439 [121 Cal.Rptr. 457, 535 P.2d 321] [\u00a7 1387 constitutionally permits prosecutor to refile felony action dismissed under \u00a7 1381 in absence of defendant\u2019s demonstration of actual prejudice]; <em>People v. Gutierrez </em>(1994) 30 Cal.App.4th 105, 111-112 [35 Cal.Rptr.2d 526].) As the Supreme Court explained, section 1387\u2019s authorization to refile a charge following a dismissal under section 1381 is consistent with the purpose of protecting a defendant\u2019s right to a speedy trial. \u201cWhen th[e] charge has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>dismissed against [the defendant] . . . because of failure to bring him to trial, the charge is no longer pending against him. We see no reason therefore why another information may not be filed against him after such dismissal. <em>He has had the first charge dismissed and thus his right to a speedy trial protected. The filing of a new information for the same offense commences a new period of time.\u201d (People v. Godlewski </em>(1943) 22 Cal.2d 677, 682-683 [140 P.2d 381], italics added; see also <em>Gutierrez, </em>at p. 111.)</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">Although the statutory authorization to refile the action (\u00a7 1387) makes sense if the action is dismissed for failure to prosecute in a timely fashion (including the failure to bring a defendant to a timely initial sentencing hearing), it is illogical to apply that section to a probationer awaiting a probation revocation hearing. The prosecution of such a defendant necessarily concluded upon the grant of probation, a final, appealable order. (See <em>Brown, supra, </em>260 Cal.App.2d at p. 751.) By the time a defendant is faced with a pending probation revocation hearing, neither the dismissal of the underlying action nor the refiling of it under a \u201cnew time clock\u201d would in any way \u201cprotect\u201d or further his or her speedy trial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">Section 1203.2a, in contrast, contemplates neither a \u201cdismissal\u201d of an action nor the \u201crefiling\u201d of an action precisely because the section only comes into effect once the action has been prosecuted to a final, appealable order, regardless of whether imposition or execution of sentence has been suspended. (\u00a7 1237.) Under section 1203.2a, the sanction for failing to revoke probation and impose sentence or execute sentence if sentence has already been imposed, within the prescribed time period, is not \u201cdismissal\u201d of the action but, appropriately, the deprivation of the probationary court\u2019s further jurisdiction in the matter. In effect, section 1203.2a tells the probationary court, act on defendant\u2019s demand that you terminate your jurisdiction, either through imposition of sentence or execution of sentence if already imposed, or lose jurisdiction by operation of this statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">Deprivation of the probationary court\u2019s continuing jurisdiction is thus wholly consistent with section 1203.2a\u2019s overall purpose of permitting the probationary court to consider imposing a concurrent sentence and \u201c \u2018precluding] the inadvertent imposition of consecutive sentences by depriving the court of further jurisdiction over the defendant\u2019 when the statutory time limits are not observed.\u201d <em>(Hoddinott, supra, </em>12 Cal.4th at p. 999.) Interpreting section 1381.5\u2019s dismissal of the \u201caction\u201d to apply to probationers after an initial sentencing hearing and the issuance of a final appealable order, in contrast, would be nonsensical, undermining both the purpose of section 1381.5 and the statutory scheme of which it is part.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>5. <em>Broughton\u2019s Demand Did Not Comport with the Requirements of Section 1203.2a</em></p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">Even though Broughton intended to invoke a right to a speedy trial under section 1381.5, if either the April motion or the October demand was sufficient to trigger section 1203.2a, she is entitled to the protection of that statute. (See <em>In re Flores </em>(1983) 140 Cal.App.3d 1019, 1022 [190 Cal.Rptr. 388] [although \u00a7 1381 not available to sentenced probationer, his demand letter should have been evaluated under the requirements of \u00a7 1203.2a].) As applied to a probationer whose sentence has not been imposed, the probationary court has 30 days from the receipt of a <em>valid, formal request </em>from the defendant within which to impose sentence or lose further jurisdiction. (\u00a7 1203.2a; <em>Hoddinott, supra, </em>12 Cal.4th at p. 999.) Broughton\u2019s April motion did not meet the strict requirements for such a request; specifically, it did not include a waiver of the right to be present and to be represented by counsel. (\u00a7 1203.2a.) In the absence of such a waiver, the court is without the constitutional power to impose sentence in the defendant\u2019s absence. <em>(Hoddinott, </em>at p. 999; see <em>Hayes v. Superior Court, supra, </em>6 Cal.3d at p. 225 [that \u00a7 1203.2a affords opportunity for concurrent sentences, if that is the trial court\u2019s discretion, only after probationer waives his or her right to be present and represented by counsel is a \u201creasonable method of effectuating proper legislative purposes\u201d and is not unconstitutional].)</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">Section 1203.2a also imposes a duty upon a probation officer to advise the probationary court within 30 days after being notified in writing of the defendant\u2019s confinement. The probation officer\u2019s failure to do so deprives the court of further jurisdiction, whether or not the letter includes a waiver of the right to be present and represented by counsel. <em>(Hoddinott, supra, </em>12 Cal.4th at p. 1000; \u00a7 1203.2a) The record before us is silent as to whether the April motion or October demand was ever delivered to Broughton\u2019s probation officer. We therefore have no basis to find that section 1203.2a was invoked or that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to set aside the prior order revoking probation and to grant probation under the terms and conditions afforded.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">Accordingly, the trial court did not err in denying Broughton\u2019s motion to dismiss the actions under section 1381.5 or in reinstating its earlier order of probation with the additional condition of one year in county jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-9\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b285-10\">The judgments (orders granting probation) in case Nos.

One of the interesting and also confounding attributes of the many \u201ccanons\u201d of legislative interpretation is that they often are in conflict and can be used to justify divergent interpretations of a given statute or statutory scheme. In this case, the majority fires a full battery of such canons aimed at demolishing the \u201cliteral\u201d language the Legislature used to define who was entitled to the benefit of Penal Code section 1381.5. Nonetheless, I am persuaded the prior courts got it right, albeit in dictum.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In my view, section 1381.5 does apply to California probationers who are in custody as federal prisoners.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">The issue is rather simple. Does the clause <em>\u201cany </em>criminal proceeding wherein the defendant <em>remains to be </em>sentenced\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> include probationers who have yet to receive a term of confinement for an alleged probation violation? That is, has someone who received probation been \u201csentenced\u201d or is she only sentenced when the court finds a violation of probation and imposes a term of imprisonment? Or assuming the initial grant of probation does constitute a \u201csentencing\u201d does a later probation revocation proceeding represent a second \u201ccriminal proceeding wherein the defendant remains to be sentenced?\u201d I grant the language is susceptible to either of these interpretations, but either one yields the same result\u2014a probation revocation proceeding falls within the broad term <em>\u201cany </em>criminal proceeding wherein the defendant remains to be sentenced.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>To find support for the conclusion a probationer is <em>not </em>\u201csentenced\u201d until given a tenn of imprisonment pursuant to revocation of her probationary status, one need look no farther than Penal Code section 1203.2a, the code section the majority finds clearly applicable to probationers.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> That statute speaks of defendants being \u201creleased on probation\u201d not as \u201csentenced to probation.\u201d It further distinguishes the status of being on probation from receiving a sentence in defining the class of defendants and situations to which its provisions apply as those where <em>\u201cno sentence has previously been imposed </em>for the offense for which he or she was <em>granted probation </em>. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">From this language in Penal Code section 1203.2a, it is more than apparent the Legislature considers a probationer \u201cremains to be sentenced\u201d until the court revokes her probation and imposes a term of confinement. That is, a release on probation is not a sentence. Accordingly, until probation is revoked and a term of confinement imposed, a defendant in federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>custody is subject to a \u201cpending . . . criminal proceeding where [she] remains to be sentenced.\u201d As a consequence, she is entitled to invoke the protections of section 1381.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">But as pointed out above, even if a defendant who receives probation is considered to have been \u201csentenced,\u201d that does not mean Penal Code section 1381.5 is inapplicable when she faces probation revocation. This second proceeding also qualifies as a \u201ccriminal proceeding wherein the defendant remains to be sentenced.\u201d It can be construed as a second stage of the initial sentencing or as a separate proceeding. But once again, either way it constitutes a \u201ccriminal proceeding wherein the defendant remains to be sentenced.\u201d No one can seriously dispute a probation revocation hearing is a \u201ccriminal proceeding.\u201d And it seems difficult to dispute it is a proceeding where a \u201csentence is imposed\u201d and until which it occurs the defendant \u201cremains to be sentenced.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">At the policy level as opposed to interpretation of the statutory language the Legislature used, the majority seeks to distinguish a defendant\u2019s interest in a timely first sentencing from her interest in a timely probation revocation proceeding. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>\u00e1t pp. 319-320.) The majority summarizes these policy considerations as \u201cavoiding prolonged imprisonment, limiting anxiety attendant to an unresolved criminal charge, reducing the effect of lapse of time on trial witnesses, and providing the opportunity for imposition of concurrent sentence.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 319.) These policies, the majority emphasizes, \u201capply to defendants who' have not been afforded a sentencing hearing\u201d as well as those who have not yet been tried. <em>{Ibid.) </em>I submit they also apply to probationers who are alleged to have violated probation. Without the protection of Penal Code section 1385.1, the possibility of probation revocation and the potential prison term resulting therefrom may remain unresolved until the federal term is completed\u2014perhaps many years hence. As a result, such probationers may experience anxiety, may lose witnesses who could disprove the alleged grounds for revocation, lose the opportunity for a concurrent sentence, and end up with prolonged imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">The majority makes much of Penal Code section 1203.2a and the opportunity it affords for probationers to seek a concurrent sentence. (Maj. opn., <em>ante </em>at pp. 321-322.) Unfortunately, this section requires probationers who wish to take advantage of its benefits to throw themselves on the mercy of the court. In order to plead for this measure of mercy, probationers must give up any opportunity to challenge the allegations they violated the terms of probation. They must surrender their rights to counsel or even to personally attend the proceeding\u2014if it can be called that\u2014where the trial court decides <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>whether to grant the request for a concurrent sentence. This may be an adequate remedy for those who know they have no chance of defeating the revocation allegations or whose maximum term upon revocation will expire before\u2014or soon after\u2014the term they are serving presently. But for many probationers it is no substitute for the opportunity afforded by Penal Code section 1385.1 (and its companion \u00a7 1381).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">For these reasons, I would interpret Penal Code section 1385.1 as embracing alleged probation violators as well as others involved in \u201ccriminal proceedings wherein the defendant remains to be sentenced.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">Appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied June 11, 2003.
