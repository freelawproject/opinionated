Appellant contends that the case should be reversed and remanded for a new trial because the trial court erred in its charge to the jury and because of the misconduct of appellees\u2019 counsel during his closing argument. For the reasons that follow, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and remand the cause for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b611-12\">As part of their proposed jury instructions, appellees requested that the court charge the jury on a \u201cschool of thought.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Over appellant\u2019s objection, the court instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>\u201cAlthough some doctors, especially of these defendant\u2019s [sic] plight [sic, \u2018might\u2019] have used a different method of diagnosis or treatment or procedures from these [sic] used by the defendant this circumstance will not by itself without more prove that the defendant was negligent. The mere fact that the defendant used an alternative method of diagnosis or treatment is not by itself without more proof of things. You are to decide whether the diagnosis or treatment or procedure used by a defendant was reasonably careful, cautio[u]s and prudent and in accordance with the standard of care required of a doctor in this field of practice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">The model for the trial court\u2019s charge to the jury is found in 3 Ohio Jury Instructions (1996) 163-164, Section 331.02, Paragraph 3, which provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">\u201cDIFFERENT METHODS. Although some other (physician) (surgeon) (in the specialty) might have used a method of (diagnosis) (treatment) (procedure) different from that used by defendant, this circumstance will not by itself, without more, prove that defendant was negligent. The mere fact that the defendant used an alternative method of (diagnosis) (treatment) (procedure) is not by itself, without more, proof of his negligence. You are to decide whether the (diagnosis) (treatment) (procedure) used by defendant was reasonably (careful) (cautious) (prudent) and in accordance with the standard of care required of a (physician) (surgeon) (specialist) in his field of practice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">This instruction informs the jury that alternative methods can be used and that the selection of one method over the other is not in and of itself negligence. See <em>Clark v. Doe </em>(1997), 119 Ohio App.3d 296, 302, 695 N.E.2d 276, 280. The instruction is grounded \u201con the principle that juries, with their limited medical knowledge, should not be forced to decide which of two acceptable treatments should have been performed by a defendant physician.\u201d Dailey, The Two Schools of Thought and Informed Consent Doctrines in Pennsylvania: A Model for Integration (1994), 98 Dickinson L.Rev. 713.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-8\">This type of jury instruction, however, is not appropriate in all medical malpractice cases. It is well established that the trial court may not instruct the jury if there is no evidence to support an issue. <em>Murphy v. Carrollton Mfg. Co. </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 585, 591, 575 N.E.2d 828, 832, citing <em>Riley v. Cincinnati </em>(1976), 46 Ohio St.2d 287, 75 O.O.2d 331, 348 N.E.2d 135. By its very terms, in medical malpractice cases, the \u201cdifferent methods\u201d charge to the jury is appropriate only if there is evidence that more than one method of diagnosis or treatment is acceptable for a particular medical condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-9\">Appellant contends that the trial court erred in giving the instruction on different methods or schools of thought because there was no evidence that an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>alternative method existed for the treatment of Caitlin\u2019s condition. Appellees disagree and point to testimony of appellant\u2019s expert witness, Dr. Prensky.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b613-4\">However, we find that the trial court erred in giving the instruction in question. The trial court\u2019s instruction would have been appropriate had there been testimony that acceptable alternative methods existed for treatment of Caitlin\u2019s condition. There were, however, no acceptable alternative methods of treatment. The only method of treating Caitlin\u2019s medical problem was the administration of vitamin B-6. The experts were unanimous that when a child has a seizure disorder caused by vitamin B-6 dependency, the only proper treatment is to give vitamin B-6. They disagreed only on whether appellees should have recognized the condition and administered vitamin B-6 in a timely manner. Appellees\u2019 decision not to give Caitlin vitamin B-6, based upon Lanzieri\u2019s misdiagnosis, cannot be considered an acceptable alternative method for treating the child. Thus, because the instruction \u201cprobably misled the jury in a matter substantially affecting the complaining party\u2019s substantial rights,\u201d <em>Becker v. Lake Cty. Mem. Hosp. </em>W. (1990), 53 Ohio St.3d 202, 208, 560 N.E.2d 165, 171, a new trial is warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">Appellant also contends that the trial court abused its discretion in allowing appellees\u2019 trial counsel to make inappropriate and prejudicial comments during his closing argument to the jury. Although our holding in Section I disposes of this appeal, we will briefly discuss some of the inappropriate and prejudicial comments made by counsel for appellees. We do so to provide the trial court with guidance on remand and to inform the bench and bar that abusive comments directed at opposing counsel and an opposing party\u2019s expert witness during closing argument should not be permitted by any court, and that such comments can indeed be grounds for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">Appellant challenges the following comments made by appellees\u2019 trial counsel during his closing argument:</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">\u201cMR. FARCHIONE: * * * This is a misrepresentation. A deliberate \u2014 and there are a lot of deliberate misrepresentations in this case and we\u2019re going to go through any number of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-8\">\u201c * * * They sought out Dr. Peterson first. They used this testimony as a club to get a settlement with Dr. Lanzieri and the radiologists because this is what Dr. Peterson had to say.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-9\">\u2018What Mr. Corrigan did following that settlement should raise feelings of disgust in you. Disgust that the legal system would allow this to happen and disgust at Mr. Corrigan as an attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-10\">\u201cMR. CORRIGAN: Objection, your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-11\">\u201cTHE COURT: Overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-12\"><em>a </em>^ * *</p>\n<p id=\"b614-13\">\u201cMR. FARCIONE: I find that very sad that he [Corrigan] would be in this courtroom in this case asking for 18 million dollars in damages and he would stand behind your back over here and laugh, folks. Actually I\u2019m not too surprised because it fits in with everything that\u2019s been going on with this case. The half-truths, the untruths, the threatening of witnesses, the suppression of evidence. It fits Mr. Corrigan\u2019s personality.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b614-14\">Appellant also points to comments made by counsel for appellees regarding appellant\u2019s expert witness, Dr. Prensky:</p>\n<p id=\"b614-15\">\u201cMR. FARCHIONE: After they get the settlement with Dr. Lanzieri what happens? Well, we can\u2019t put this case on with Dr. Peterson so let\u2019s threaten him with a lawsuit if he comes into Ohio so he can\u2019t come in live. Let\u2019s go out and find a second-class expert. Someone who failed the boards, bought his way into pediatric neurology and received 40 percent of his income from testifying. Let\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>find someone like that to screw over these good doctors. And then let\u2019s read Dr. Peterson\u2019s depo, those little portions that help us.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">\n<em>ii</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">\u201c * * * Now, what does that say about his role here? He\u2019s trying to earn that 40 percent to keep his standard of living up higher because he has a reputation to maintain a typical presentation of B-6 dependency.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">Appellant contends that these comments and others were \u201cso prejudicial as to influence the jury beyond the bounds of normal argument.\u201d Appellant, however, did not object at trial to most of the above and other complained-of comments made by appellees\u2019 counsel. Nevertheless, appellant contends that the trial court should have intervened <em>sua sponte </em>to admonish counsel and correct the prejudicial effect of the misconduct. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">We acknowledge that counsel should be afforded great latitude in closing argument, <em>State v. Champion </em>(1924), 109 Ohio St. 281, 289, 142 N.E. 141, 143, and that the determination of whether the bounds of permissible argument have been exceeded is, in the first instance, a discretionary function to be performed by the trial court, <em>Pang v. Minch </em>(1990), 53 Ohio St.3d 186, 559 N.E.2d 1313, paragraph three of the syllabus. Therefore, the trial court\u2019s determination will not be reversed absent an abuse of discretion. <em>Id. </em>However, \u201c[w]here <em>gross </em>and <em>abusive </em>conduct occurs, the trial court is <em>bound, sua sponte, to correct the prejudicial effect of counsel\u2019s misconduct.\u201d </em>(Emphasis <em>sic.) Snyder v. Stanford </em>(1968), 15 Ohio St.2d 31, 37, 44 O.O.2d 18, 21, 238 N.E.2d 563, 568. See, also, <em>Jones v. Macedonia-Northfield Banking Co. </em>(1937), 132 Ohio St. 341, 351, 8 O.O. 108, 112-113, 7 N.E.2d 544, 549:</p>\n<p id=\"b615-9\">\u201cIt may be said unhesitatingly that these records present a case in which objection or exception to the argument of counsel for plaintiff was not necessary to raise the question of misconduct of plaintiffs counsel. The judge who presides over a cause is not a mere umpire; he may not sit by and allow the grossest injustice to be perpetrated without interference. It is his duty in the executive control of the trial to see that counsel do not create an atmosphere which is surcharged with passion or prejudice and in which the fair and impartial administration of justice cannot be accomplished. It was the duty of the trial court to stop argument and require counsel to proceed in an orderly and lawyer-like manner.\u201d (Citation omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b615-10\">Counsel for appellees made various assertions and drew many inferences that were simply not warranted by the evidence. To attack counsel for appellant and appellant\u2019s expert witness was inexcusable, unprincipled, and clearly outside the scope of final argument. Appellees\u2019 counsel could have zealously represented his clients without resorting to these abusive tactics. Instead, counsel for appellees transcended the bounds of acceptable closing argument, creating an atmosphere <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>\u201csurcharged with passion or prejudice.\u201d <em>Id., </em>132 Ohio St. at 351, 8 O.O. at 113, 7 N.E.2d at 549.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">Accordingly, we conclude that regardless of the fact that counsel for appellant did not object to each contested comment, the conduct of appellees\u2019 counsel during his closing argument constituted reversible misconduct. In reaching our conclusion that a new trial is warranted, we are guided by the principle that if \u201cthere is room for doubt, whether the verdict was rendered upon the evidence, or may have been influenced by improper remarks of counsel, that doubt should be resolved in favor of the defeated party.\u201d <em>Warder, Bushnell &amp; Glessner Co. v. Jacobs </em>(1898), 58 Ohio St. 77, 85, 50 N.E. 97, 99.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">Appellant also maintains that during closing argument counsel for appellees disregarded a previous ruling by the trial court with respect to a motion by appellant to exclude the settlement amount reached between appellant and Lanzieri and University Radiologists. Appellant claims that the comments of appellees\u2019 counsel regarding the settlement amounted to reversible misconduct. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">Prior to trial, appellant moved to \u201ckeep the settlement figure and the number out of the opening statement, and out of closing arguments and away from the jury.\u201d Counsel for appellant then agreed that the jury could be informed that a settlement had been entered into with Lanzieri and University Radiologists but that the dollar figure reached in the settlement would not be disclosed to the jury. At the beginning of trial, the trial court cautioned the jury that \u201cDr. Lanzieri and University Radiologists are defendants. Settlement agreements were reached between the plaintiffs and those two defendants. You may not speculate about reasons for the settlement, nor the amount of the settlement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b616-8\">According to appellant, counsel for appellees \u201cproceeded to lead the jury to speculate on the reasons for the settlement and the settlement amount in direct and flagrant violation of the courts [sic] wishes.\u201d In support, appellant points to various comments made by appellees\u2019 counsel during his closing argument.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b616-9\">However, we agree with the court of appeals that the comments made by counsel for appellees during his closing argument regarding the settlement were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>not \u201cso egregious and prejudicial that the trial court abused its discretion by failing to admonish counsel and take curative action.\u201d Appellant had agreed that a disclosure of the settlement was proper, and the jury was not specifically apprised of the dollar amount of the settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">As a final note, in keeping with this court\u2019s efforts at promoting professionalism, we make the following general observations. We recognize the circumstances of heat of argument. We understand and accept zeal for a client. Having all been there, we know that the line between forceful advocacy and unacceptable conduct is sometimes obscure. However, none of these factors palliates misconduct when the fair administration of justice is a casualty. Given our renewed focus on the continuing need for decorum and respect for clients, each other, courts, and all other persons, if we err we should err on the side of professionalism.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and remand this cause to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b617-8\">Resnick, F.E.

When questioned by counsel for the defense on cross-examination, Dr. Prensky testified as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">\u201cQ Now, you\u2019ve heard of the concept of school of thought, correct?</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">\u201cA Well, I\u2019ve heard of that concept.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">\u201cQ Right.

It would be wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-20\">\u201cQ The bottom line is, doctor, that while most pediatric neurologists in your opinion would have used B-6 you would at least concede that there is a minority school of thought that would not, correct?</p>\n<p id=\"b613-21\">\u201cA I think a minority would not have in anything as we\u2019ve discussed.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b616-10\">. \u201cMR.

I disagree with the majority\u2019s framing of \u2014 and answer to \u2014 the question with respect to the jury-instruction issue. I also disagree with its conclusion that defense counsel\u2019s remarks during closing argument were so egregious as to require reversal in the absence of timely objection. Accordingly, I would affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-13\">JURY INSTRUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b617-14\">The majority decides that the jury instruction on alternative methods \u201cprobably misled the jury in a matter substantially affecting the [plaintiffs] substantial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>rights.\u201d But I think the court <em>properly </em>instructed the jury, given the evidence presented regarding the standard of care. The majority decision turns on the observation that there was no evidence presented at trial that there was more than one acceptable way to treat an infant with \u201ca seizure disorder caused by vitamin B-6 dependency.\u201d In my view, however, the court of appeals correctly understood the question to be whether there was evidence presented that there was more than one acceptable way to treat \u201can infant with intractable seizures.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">The majority acknowledges that \u201c[t]he trial court\u2019s instruction would have been appropriate had there been testimony that acceptable alternative methods existed for treatment of Caitlin\u2019s condition.\u201d Plaintiffs expert testified that, given Caitlin\u2019s known symptoms, diagnosis, and medical history known to the defendants in March 1991, the standard of care required that they give Caitlin vitamin B-6 between March 11 and 13, 1991 (presumably to test for and, if present, treat B-6 dependency). Defendants\u2019 expert testified that, under the circumstances, defendants\u2019 failure to administer B-6 did not fall below the standard of care. This conflicting testimony presents the basis for instructing the jury on alternative methods.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">DEFENSE COUNSEL\u2019S REMARKS DURING CLOSING ARGUMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">While I agree that the argument of defense counsel demeans the role of counsel and ought not to be condoned, I also agree with the court of appeals that, given our deference to the preferred vantage of the trial court, the remarks do not present reversible error. As the court of appeals noted, the latitude to be afforded to counsel during closing argument is within the sound discretion of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">Furthermore, though complaining on appeal that the closing argument was clearly prejudicial, counsel failed to object,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> triggering a plain-error review. \u201cIn <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>appeals of civil cases, the plain error doctrine is not favored and may be applied only in the extremely rare case involving exceptional circumstances where error, to which no objection was made at the trial court, seriously affects the basic fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial process, thereby challenging the legitimacy of the underlying judicial process itself.\u201d <em>Goldfuss v. Davidson </em>(1997), 79 Ohio St.3d 116, 679 N.E.2d 1099, syllabus. And counsel\u2019s argument was not so egregious that it \u201cgrossly and persistently abuse[d] his privilege,\u201d <em>Snyder v. Stanford </em>(1968), 15 Ohio St.2d 31, 44 O.O.2d 18, 238 N.E.2d 563, paragraph one of the syllabus. Consequently, I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the trial court was bound to intervene despite the absence of a proper objection by plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">Because I believe that neither the trial court\u2019s alternative-methods jury instruction nor its failure to intervene <em>sua sponte </em>during defendants\u2019 closing argument constitutes reversible error, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b619-7\">Lundberg Stratton, J., concurs in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b618-8\">.
