The commission denied her application on the ground that her disability had not resulted from the medical conditions allowed for her industrial injury. The Court of Appeals for Franklin County denied the writ, finding that the commission had some evidence on which to base this conclusion and, thus, had not abused its discretion in denying TTD. <em>State ex rel. Burley v. Coil Packing, Inc. </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 18, 31 OBR 70, 508 N.E.2d 936. Griffith appeals as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-17\">Griffith sustained an industrial injury while working for appellee Rubbermaid, Inc., a self-insured employer for the purpose of workers\u2019 compensation laws. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>When she applied for TTD, only two conditions had been formally recognized by her employer as compensible in her claim \u2014 \u201ccontusion left knee\u201d and \u201cinternal derangement/tear medial meniscus left knee.\u201d Griffith had arthroscopic knee surgery on December 6, 1995, and alleged a period of temporary and total disability beginning on that date as a result of her surgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">Rubbermaid authorized and paid for Griffith\u2019s surgery after her physician represented, in a C-161 Request for Authorization Form, that the allowed conditions required the arthroscopy. But according to a hospital report prepared on the day of her surgery, Griffith\u2019s physician\u2019s preoperative reason for performing the knee surgery was \u201c[degenerative arthritis,\u201d not the \u201c[c]ontusion left knee, internal derangement/tear medial meniscus\u201d he had represented to Rubbermaid. The hospital report also confirmed the physician\u2019s preoperative diagnosis \u2014 it revealed that his postoperative diagnosis was \u201cthe same\u201d as the preoperative diagnosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">The discrepancy between the physician\u2019s two explanations for Griffith\u2019s surgery prompted the commission\u2019s findings that the surgery was not treatment for her allowed conditions and, therefore, had not caused any disability attributable to her industrial injury. Griffith now challenges that finding with four propositions of law. We are not persuaded by any of her arguments and, therefore, affirm the court of appeals\u2019 judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">Griffith first argues that since she had had surgery made necessary by previously authorized surgery on the part of her body in which her injury had caused the allowed medical conditions in her claim, any medical condition that subsequently developed in that \u201callowed body part\u201d as a result of the second surgery was also compensable. She cites <em>Dent v. AT&amp;T Technologies, Inc. </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 187, 527 N.E.2d 821, and <em>State ex rel. Miller v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1994), 71 Ohio St.3d 229, 643 N.E.2d 113, but neither case dispensed with the requirement that medical conditions be formally recognized, either through certification by a self-insured employer or allowance by the Ohio Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation (\u201cBWC\u201d), as having been caused by a claimant\u2019s industrial injury. In fact, we specifically rejected this idea in <em>State ex rel. Meridia Hillcrest Hosp. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1995), 74 Ohio St.3d 39, 656 N.E.2d 336.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">In <em>Meridia, </em>we distinguished <em>Dent </em>and <em>Miller </em>as cases in which the parties were debating whether the claimants either had complied or needed to comply with the statute of limitations in R.C. 4123.84, which requires claimants to notify their employers of the specific body part injured within two years of the industrial injury. See, also, <em>State ex rel. Lear Siegler, Inc. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(Aug. 9, 1977), Franklin App. No. 77AP-276, unreported. But in ensuring notice to employers and cutting off stale claims, <em>Wargetz v. Villa Sancta Anna Home for Aged </em>(1984), 11 Ohio St.3d 15, 17, 11 OBR 49, 51, 462 N.E.2d 1215, 1217, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>compliance with R.C. 4123.84 is a completely different question from whether a medical condition has been determined to be compensable as the result of an industrial injury. And where, as here, the notice requirement in R.C. 4123.84 is not at stake, <em>Meridia </em>concomitantly establishes that formal allowance is required. <em>Id., </em>74 Ohio St.3d at 42, 656 N.E.2d at 339. Accordingly, we reject Griffith\u2019s first proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">Griffith next argues that Rubbermaid certified her arthritic condition as part of her claim by authorizing and paying for her knee surgery. She relies on <em>State ex rel. Baker Material Handling Corp. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 202, 631 N.E.2d 138, and <em>Garrett v. Jeep Corp. </em>(1991), 77 Ohio App.3d 402, 602 N.E.2d 691; however, the courts in those cases did not find the employers responsible for the claimants\u2019 additionally alleged conditions just because the employers authorized and paid for medical treatment. Rather, those employers were held accountable because they had explicitly acknowledged and certified the additional conditions on C-174 forms designed, in part, to inform BWC about compensable conditions in their claims. <em>Baker, </em>69 Ohio St.3d at 204, 631 N.E.2d at 141; <em>Garrett, </em>77 Ohio App.3d at 406, 602 N.E.2d at 694. See, also, <em>State ex rel. Chrysler Corp. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 158, 159, 689 N.E.2d 951, 953. Rubbermaid has made no such explicit concessions. Thus, we hold that Rubbermaid did not allow Griffith\u2019s arthritic condition under <em>Baker </em>or <em>Garrett.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">But Griffith also contends, in effect, that this self-insured employer implicitly certified Griffith\u2019s medical conditions as compensable. She maintains that Rubbermaid had notice of the additional justification for Griffith\u2019s arthroscopy because, just before the surgery, her physician wrote a letter to Rubbermaid indicating that she also had developed degenerative arthritis related to her injury. The court of appeals could find no authority for attributing an implied certification to Rubbermaid, and we have no reason to create such a precedent based on these facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">It is not clear that Rubbermaid relied on the letter in addition to the formal request for authorization. But even assuming that Rubbermaid did rely on the letter, the letter did not give the notice of a new condition that Griffith attributes to it. The letter advised that while early arthritic changes \u201cappear[ed]\u201d to be present in her knee, those changes \u201cwould really not [have] chang[ed] the fact that she [was] having enough trouble for arthroscopic procedure.\u201d The court of appeals reasonably concluded that even with the accompanying nonallowed arthritic condition, this statement suggested that the allowed knee condition, by itself, necessitated the planned surgery. And since the existence of a contributing nonallowed condition is not a legitimate reason for refusing to pay for medical treatment independently required for an allowed condition, <em>State ex rel. Waddle v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 452, 457, 619 N.E.2d 1018, 1021, approval of the surgery in reliance on the letter would not imply acceptance of a new <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>condition. The court of appeals correctly found that some evidence supported the commission\u2019s denial of TTD. Accordingly, we also reject Griffith\u2019s second proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">In her third proposition of law, Griffith maintains that'the commission had no authority to deny TTD for any reason other than that originally advanced by Rubbermaid. Rubbermaid initially rejected Griffith\u2019s TTD application on the ground that she had retired from her job voluntarily in February 1995, months before the knee surgery as a result of which she claimed to be temporarily and totally disabled. Griffith argues that Rubbermaid waived other defenses to her TTD claim, even though Rubbermaid had no documents in its possession at the time of the rejection that showed that Griffith\u2019s disability arose from a nonallowed condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">Griffith again relies on <em>Baker, supra, </em>as well as <em>State ex rel. Saunders v. Metal Container Corp. </em>(Nov. 29, 1988), Franklin App. No. 87AP-509, unreported, 1988 WL 129162, affirmed (1990), 52 Ohio St.3d 85, 556 N.E.2d 168, both of which confirmed that the commission cannot, over the claimant\u2019s objection, change the nature of an allowed condition once certified by a self-insured employer. But neither <em>Baker </em>nor <em>Saunders </em>is controlling here' because, as discussed, Rubbermaid never formally recognized the compensability of Griffith\u2019s arthritic condition. Moreover, neither of these cases goes so far as to establish that a self-insured employer is forever bound by its initial reason for disallowing a certain type of compensation, especially where, as here, the employer had no realistic way to know that another legitimate defense existed. Accordingly, Griffith\u2019s third proposition of law, too, is rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">Finally, Griffith contends that her retirement was involuntary and due to her industrial injury, so that her 1995 retirement does not disqualify her from receiving TTD. See <em>State ex rel. Rockwell Internatl. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 44, 531 N.E.2d 678 (claimant who retires from place of employment for reasons unrelated to industrial injury has independently prevented return to workplace and is not eligible for TTD). We have already decided that the commission had some evidence upon which to deny Griffith TTD on grounds unrelated to retirement and, therefore, did not abuse its discretion. Accordingly, we do not reach the issue presented in Griffith\u2019s fourth proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">For these reasons, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals and deny the requested writ of mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-9\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed and writ denied.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b271-10\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
