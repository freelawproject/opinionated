Ramirez v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St.2d 630, 23 O.O.3d 518, 433 N.E.2d 586. Accordingly, TTC is unavailable to one who has returned to work, <em>i.e., </em>is earning wages. Claimant contends that not just any \u201cwork\u201d bars TTC but only that which is \u201csubstantially gainful employment.\u201d Arguing that his labor was neither \u201csubstantial\u201d nor \u201cgainful,\u201d claimant asserts an entitlement to TTC. We find otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-12\"><em>Ramirez, </em>the preeminent TTC case, refers simply to a \u201creturn to work,\u201d without any qualification to the word \u201cwork.\u201d R.C. 4123.56(A) mirrors this language. Two cases, however, do employ the phrases \u201csustained gainful employment\u201d or \u201csubstantially gainful employment.\u201d Upon review, we find these cases not dispositive.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-13\">The first case, <em>State ex rel. Peabody Coal Co. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 639, 614 N.E.2d 1044, cites <em>Ramirez </em>and <em>Vulcan Materials Co. </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1986), 25 Ohio St.3d 31, 25 OBR 26, 494 N.E.2d 1125, as supporting \u201csustained gainful employment\u201d as the standard for TTC termination. Neither <em>Ramirez </em>nor <em>Vulcan Materials, </em>however, uses that language, destroying <em>Peabody\u2019s </em>legal foundation.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>Claimant also cites <em>State ex rel. Johnson v. Rawac Plating Co. </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 599, 575 N.E.2d 837, focusing on the following language:</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">\u201cIn <em>State ex rel. Nye v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1986), 22 Ohio St.3d 75, 22 OBR 91, 488 N.E.2d 867, we held that \u2018work\u2019 as used in <em>Ramirez </em>referred to <em>any </em>\u2018substantially gainful employment,\u2019 not merely the former position of employment.\u201d (Emphasis <em>sic.) Id. </em>at 600, 575 N.E.2d at 839.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">Claimant\u2019s interpretation of <em>Johnson </em>is too broad as an examination of <em>Nye </em>will illustrate. Critical to an understanding of <em>Nye </em>is that in that case there was never a question as to the character of claimant\u2019s work. <em>Nye </em>was clearly engaged in substantially gainful work as a full-time reupholsterer. The issue was whether substantially gainful work other than the former position of employment could be used to terminate TTC.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">We held in the affirmative, reasoning that:</p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">\u201c[A contrary decision] would permit the payment of temporary total disability benefits to a claimant who has chosen to return to full-time work at a job other than his former employment. In such a case, the claimant is no longer suffering the loss of earnings for which temporary total disability benefits are intended to compensate. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b230-9\">\u201cIn the case at bar, the commission determined that appellee had returned to \u2018substantially gainful remunerative employment,\u2019 <em>i.e., </em>full-time work.\u201d 22 Ohio St.3d at 77-78, 22 OBR at 93, 488 N.E.2d at 870.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-10\"><em>Nye </em>merely confirmed that substantially gainful employment barred TTC. It did not, as claimant represents, create two categories of employment whereby only substantially gainful employment terminated TTC and more sporadic employment did not. Again, <em>Ramirez </em>states that a \u201creturn to work\u201d bars TTC. In this case, claimant does not dispute that his paid scuba diving instruction constitutes \u201cwork.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b230-11\">The more appropriate method of compensating claimants who are unable to return to their former position of employment and are earning less elsewhere is through wage-loss compensation under R.C. 4123.56(B). Claimant appears to be seeking payment of wage-loss compensation from January 6, 1993 through May 2, 1993. R.C. 4123.52, however, forbids the payment of benefits more than two years prior to the request for compensation. Here, wage-loss compensation was requested on May 3, 1995. The commission did not, therefore, abuse its discretion in denying wage-loss compensation prior to May 3, 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-12\">We note finally that the court of appeals returned the cause to the commission to consider claimant\u2019s wage-loss-compensation eligibility \u201cfor any period from two years prior to May 3, 1995.\u201d Claimant, however, neither requested, nor alleged an entitlement to, wage-loss compensation after August 18, 1993. Since the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>commission already awarded wage-loss compensation from May 3, 1993 through August 18, 1993, we find it unnecessary to return the cause for further consideration of wage-loss-compensation eligibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\">Accordingly, claimant\u2019s request for a writ of mandamus is denied. The judgment of the court of appeals denying claimant\u2019s request for TTC is affirmed, and the remainder of the judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed in part, reversed in part and unit denied.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b231-6\">Moyer, C.J., Pfeifer, Cook and Lundberg Stratton, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b231-7\">Douglas, Resnick and F.E.
