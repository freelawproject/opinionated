The court of appeals found R.C. 4123.32(D)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> applicable to this matter, and neither New Crosset nor the Bureau argues with that conclusion. However, given the unique factual circumstances surrounding Old Crosset\u2019s \u201ctransfer of business,\u201d we find that R.C. 4123.32(D), and more precisely the language emphasized above, is inapplicable. Therefore, under the specific facts of this case, we hold that New Crosset is not liable for the retrospective-rating claims costs of Old Crosset.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">We begin with the premise that \u201c \u2018[w]here the language of a statute is plain and unambiguous and conveys a clear and definite meaning there is no occasion for * * * [resort] to rules of statutory interpretation. An unambiguous statute is to be applied, not interpreted.\u2019 \u201d <em>Meeks v. Papadopulos </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St.2d 187, 190, 16 O.O.3d 212, 213, 404 N.E.2d 159, 161, quoting <em>Sears v. Weimer </em>(1944), 143 Ohio St. 312, 28 O.O. 270, 55 N.E.2d 413, paragraph five of the syllabus. Statutory interpretation is necessary only in those instances when a statute is found to be subject to various interpretations. <em>Id., </em>62 Ohio St.2d at 190, 16 O.O.3d at 214, 404 N.E.2d at 162. We conclude that the specific language of R.C. 4123.32(D) under consideration herein, <em>ie., </em>\u201cemployer transfers his business in whole or in part or otherwise reorganizes the business,\u201d is plain and unambiguous. The language of the statute clearly refers to a voluntary act of the employer and not the involuntary transfer of the employer\u2019s business through an intermediary bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-9\">In this matter, there was no transfer of the business by the employer. Old Crosset did not have any assets to transfer, as its assets had been seized by Society and Fifth Third. The transaction between New Crosset and the banks did not occur until after Old Crosset had ceased operation of its entire wholesale produce business. Thus, Old Crosset was not, nor could it have been, the transferor of its own assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>Additionally, New Crosset purchased the assets through an \u201cAsset Sale Agreement.\u201d The signatories to that agreement were TCC (New Crosset),. Castellini Company, Society, and Fifth Third. Old Crosset was not a party to the agreement. Here, the transferors of the assets are banks that have neither experience ratings nor workers\u2019 compensation coverage to which New Crosset could succeed. The transfer of the assets was not achieved through a corporate transaction conducted between Old Crosset and New Crosset, but, instead, was accomplished by a sale between New Crosset and the banks.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">While it is true that R.C. 1309.47(D)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> contemplates the discharge of security interests and other liens where, after default, collateral is disposed of by a secured party (here the banks), nevertheless the intent seems to be 'that a purchaser for value \u201ctakes free of all * * * rights and interests.\u201d A contrary holding by this court would subject all purchasers of assets from secured parties, where the purchasers intended to continue in the same business, to liabilities of debtors, even though such purchasers might not have any way of determining what, if any, such liabilities might exist. Chances are that before, during, and after forfeiture of assets of a debtor to a secured creditor, even the secured creditor may not know or have any way to find out about any outstanding obligations junior to the secured creditor\u2019s interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">In reaching their decisions, both the court of appeals and the Bureau relied on this court\u2019s decision in <em>State ex rel. Lake Erie Constr. Co. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1991), 62 Ohio St.3d 81, 578 N.E.2d 458. As a result, significant portions of both parties\u2019 arguments center on the applicability of <em>Lake Erie </em>and its interpretation of the R.C. 4123.32(D) phrase \u201csuccessor in interest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b586-8\">In <em>Lake Erie, </em>Lake Erie Construction Company (\u201cLake Erie\u201d) challenged a decision by the Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation to combine the experience rating of its predecessor, the Paul E. Bleile Company, with that of its own. The court upheld the decision of the Bureau and, in so doing, rejected Lake Erie\u2019s assertion that the common-law definition of \u201csuccessor in interest\u201d applied. <em>Id. </em>at 83, 578 N.E.2d at 460. In resolving the issue in <em>Lake Erie, </em>the court construed the term \u201csuccessor in interest,\u201d as contemplated by R.C. 4123.32(D) and former <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>Ohio Adm.Code 4127-7-02(B),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> for purposes of workers\u2019 compensation, as meaning a \u201ctransferee of a business in whole or in part.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 84, 578 N.E.2d at 460.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">New Crosset urges that <em>Lake Erie </em>is inapplicable to the instant matter, since the issue under consideration therein involved risk <em>experience </em>ratings and not a retrospective-rating premium plan, two concepts that New Crosset contends are irreconcilable. In contrast, the Bureau argues that the court\u2019s decision in <em>Lake Erie </em>did not hinge on the type of rating involved and urges that we apply the definition of \u201csuccessor in interest\u201d set forth therein. The Bureau contends that New Crosset fits the definition of \u201csuccessor in interest\u201d espoused in <em>Lake Erie </em>because New Crosset is merely a transferee of Old Crosset\u2019s business.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\"><em>Lake Erie </em>involved experience rating, a concept used to determine whether a particular employer should be assigned premium rates higher than or less than the \u201cbasic rate\u201d that is assigned to employers within the same classification. In experience rating, the employer\u2019s past claims history, or experience, is consulted to compute a rate that produces premiums sufficient to pay future claims. Ohio Adm.Code 4123-17-03. An employer who establishes a \u201cgood\u201d claims history is able to reduce its premium rate below the basic rate for employers in the same classification, whereas an employer with a bad loss experience is penalized and must pay a rate in excess of the basic rate. Fulton, <em>supra, </em>at 386-387, Section 14.7.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-8\">In contrast, a retrospective-rating plan is an alternative premium plan that is designed to give employers a financial advantage by lowering their annual workers\u2019 compensation premium. Rather than pay substantial premiums each year (and consequently no claims costs), under a retrospective-rating plan the employer is permitted by the Bureau to pay a lower premium for one year. In exchange, the employer agrees to pay the actual medical costs and compensation of each claim arising during that year. The Bureau monitors these claims for ten years, known as the \u201cevaluation period,\u201d and the employer is then able to spread out its medical costs and compensation payments over this period. R.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>4123.29(A)(3), Ohio Adm.Code 4123-17-41, 4123-17-44, 4123-17-46, 4123-17-52. See, also, Fulton, <em>supra, </em>at 387-388, Section 14.8.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">Additionally, it is clear that the obligations assumed by an employer operating under a retrospective-rating plan are markedly different from those of an experience-rated employer. As R.C. 4123.29(A)(3) indicates, a retrospective-rating plan is an <em>alternative </em>premium payment plan. There is no obligation, statutory or otherwise, that would mandate an employer to participate in such a plan. A qualifying employer has complete discretion, subject of course to the Bureau\u2019s approval, whether to participate in a retrospective-rating plan. Ohio Adm.Code 4123-17-43(A) and 4123-17-42(C)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">Essentially, a retrospective-rating plan is a method of financing the payment of premiums that is contractual in nature. The employer and the Bureau agree on a reduced premium according to such factors as the amount of risk the employer is willing to accept and the maximum amount the employer is willing to pay. Again, these terms are subject to the ultimate approval of the Bureau. Thus, the amount of an employer\u2019s premium payment under a retrospective-rating plan is based on the terms of the agreement reached between the employer and the Bureau. Ohio Adm.Code 4123-17-42 through 4123-17-47. See, also, Fulton, <em>supra, </em>at 387, Section 14.8. There is clearly a distinct and fundamental difference between the transfer of ratings based upon a predecessor\u2019s claims experience and holding a successor company liable for claims due that the predecessor itself promised to pay under a retrospective-rating plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">Furthermore, R.C. 4123.32(D) confers two distinct types of rulemaking power on the Bureau. The first type is to adopt rules establishing which workers\u2019 compensation premium <em>rates </em>apply when \u201cone employer takes over the occupation or industry of another.\u201d The second type is to adopt rules establishing who should assume <em>payments </em>due on an employer\u2019s account after he \u201ctransfers his business in whole or in part, or otherwise reorganizes the business.\u201d <em>Lake Erie </em>concerned the Bureau\u2019s power to regulate rates, and not the power to regulate payments, the issue in the instant matter. In defining the term \u201csuccessor in interest,\u201d <em>Lake Erie </em>may have confused the two rulemaking powers set forth in R.C. 4123.32(D). In any event, we continue to adhere to our position that the definition of \u201csuccessor in interest\u201d in <em>Lake Erie </em>is properly applied for purposes of transferring or combining the experience ratings of employers. As the Bureau\u2019s Law Director astutely points out, the rule in <em>Lake Erie </em>\u201cis designed to place workers\u2019 compensation [rate] <em>experience </em>with the proper employer * * * embracing] the general philosophy that the best predictor of future performance is <em>past experience.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) However, this case has nothing to do with experience ratings, and the rationale espoused above is irrelevant in a retrospective-rating plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>Moreover, R.C. 4123.32(D) requires that those rules adopted by the Administrator, in addition to being necessary to safeguard the fund, must also be \u201cjust in the circumstances.\u201d In this matter there was no transfer between Old Crosset and New Crosset, no agreement or negotiations between the two, and no opportunity for New Crosset, through the intermediary banks, to determine the claims obligations of Old Crosset. To label New Crosset a \u201csuccessor in interest,\u201d as defined in <em>Lake Erie, </em>and thus hold New Crosset liable for Old Crosset\u2019s prior obligations, would, in our determination, be unjust. Given the facts of this particular case, we are unwilling to hold New Crosset liable. Therefore, based on the foregoing, we conclude that New Crosset is not a \u201csuccessor in interest,\u201d as that term was contemplated by <em>Lake Erie </em>and R.C. 4123.32(D), and we find that the court of appeals and the Bureau erred when they determined otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">Having deemed that R.C. 4123.32(D) is inapplicable and that New Crosset is not a \u201csuccessor in interest,\u201d we turn to common-law principles of successor liability to determine what obligations, if any, New Crosset may have acquired regarding Old Crosset\u2019s retrospective-rating agreement. In <em>Welco Industries, Inc. v. Applied Cos. </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 344, 617 N.E.2d 1129, syllabus, the court held that \u201c[a] corporation that purchases the assets of another is not liable for the contractual liabilities-of its predecessor corporation unless (1) the buyer expressly or impliedly agrees to assume such liability; (2) the transaction amounts to a de facto consolidation or merger; (3) the buyer corporation is merely a continuation of the seller corporation; or (4) the transaction is entered into fraudulently for the purpose of escaping liability. <em>(Flaugher v. Cone Automatic Machine Co. </em>[1987], 30 Ohio St.3d 60, 30 OBR 165, 507 N.E.2d 331, followed.)\u201d We find that the general rule of <em>Welco, i.e., </em>that a purchaser of a corporation\u2019s assets, barring any of the exceptions, is not liable for the debts and obligations of a predecessor corporation, is applicable to the case at bar. In addition to all the foregoing and because we find that New Crosset does not fit into any of the four exceptions to the general rule, we hold that New Crosset is not liable for the retrospective-rating claims costs of Old Crosset.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">Accordingly, for the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the court of appeals is reversed, and the writ of mandamus is granted in full.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-8\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and writ granted.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b590-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>Resnick, F.E.

I respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s decision to grant the requested writ to New Crosset in this case. In holding that R.C. 4123.32(D) does not apply to this matter, and- that New Crosset is not liable for the retrospective-rating claims costs of its predecessor, the majority uses \u201cthe specific facts of this case\u201d to justify a deviation from the statutes and rules of Ohio\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation scheme, as well as from this court\u2019s own precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">As the majority notes, R.C. 4123.32(D) permits the administrator to subject \u201csuccessors in interest\u201d to the account of and contributions due from an employer who \u201ctransfers his business in whole or in part or otherwise reorganizes the business.\u201d R.C. 4123.32(D). For R.C. 4123.32(D) to apply, then, two conditions must be satisfied. First, a \u201ctransfer\u201d or \u201creorganization\u201d of the predecessor employer\u2019s business must have occurred. Second, the new employer must fit the definition of a \u201csuccessor in interest.\u201d The majority holds that neither of these conditions was satisfied in this case, but I think that both conditions were satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-9\">\n<em>A. Old Crosset \u201cTransferred\u201d or \u201cOtherwise Reorganized\u201d its Business</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b590-10\">First we consider whether Old Crosset \u201ctransferred] [its] business in whole or in part or otherwise reorganized] the business.\u201d R.C. 4123.32(D). Focusing only on the first half of this phrase, the majority concludes that because Old Crosset did not <em>voluntarily </em>transfer its business, New Crosset was not subject to the administrator\u2019s authority establishing liability for Old Crosset\u2019s retrospective-rating claims costs. The majority also implies that the presence of an intermediary bank, and the lack of direct negotiations between Old and New Crosset, mean that no \u201ctransfer\u201d occurred to trigger the rulemaking authority of the administrator under R.C. 4123.32(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-11\">But contrary to the majority\u2019s thesis, a \u201ctransfer\u201d encompasses <em>\u201cevery </em>meth<em>od </em>\u2014 direct <em>or indirect, </em>absolute or conditional, <em>voluntary or involuntary </em>\u2014 of disposing of or parting with property or with an interest in property, including retention of title as a security interest <em>and foreclosure of the debtor\u2019s equity of redemption.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (7 Ed.1999) 1503. As a verb, \u201ctransfer\u201d means \u201cto convey or make over (title, right, or property) by deed <em>or legal process.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) XVIII Oxford English Dictionary (2 Ed.1989) 396. Our own commercial code defines \u201ctransfer\u201d for purposes of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act as \u201cevery <em>direct or indirect, </em>absolute or conditional, and <em>voluntary or involuntary </em>method of disposing of or parting with an asset.\u201d (Emphasis added.) R.C. 1336.01(L).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">Moreover, the majority focuses its analysis on only half of the statutory phrase that supports the authority of the administrator. As quoted above, R.C. 4123.32(D) permits the administrator to adopt special rules and subject an employer to a predecessor\u2019s account and contributions when \u201cany employer transfers his business in whole or in part <em>or otherwise reorganizes the business.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) R.C. 4123.32(D). The second half of the phrase \u2014 quoted, but never applied, by the majority \u2014 contains even broader triggering language than the \u201ctransfer\u201d phrase that precedes it, and contemplates many other situations (in <em>addition </em>to an employer\u2019s transfer of the business) where the administrator is authorized to assess the liability of a successor in interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">In fact, the word \u201creorganization\u201d is a commonly used term for the restructuring of a business that occurs in bankruptcy. Employers forced into such proceedings would likely hesitate to describe such actions as' voluntary. The majority, however, holds that without a voluntary transfer, R.C. 4123.32(D) is' inapplicable. I believe that this position unduly narrows the language of R.C. 4123.32(D), and erroneously restricts the administrator from engaging in his delegated rulemaking function.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-8\">\n<em>B. New Crosset Qualifies as a Successor in Interest</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b591-9\">The second requirement under R.C. 4123.32(D) \u2014 -to trigger the administrator\u2019s authority to require a successor employer to assume the predecessor employer\u2019s account and contributions \u2014 focuses not on the actions of the old employer, but rather on the status of the new employer. In order to authorize the administrator, the new employer must qualify as a successor in interest. R.C. 4123.32(D). We have held that \u201ca successor in interest, for workers\u2019 compensation purposes, is simply a transferee of a business <em>in whole or in part.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>State ex rel. Lake Erie Constr. Co. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1991), 62 Ohio St.3d 81, 83-84, 578 N.E.2d 458, 460. In <em>Lake Erie, </em>we concluded that the successor employer qualified as a successor in interest under R.C. 4123.32(D) (and an associated rule) because an existing entity, the successor employer, bought the predecessor employer\u2019s tools and equipment, agreed to employ the predecessor\u2019s employees, and assumed the predecessor\u2019s leases \u2014 even though the .successor continued operations under a distinct name. <em>Id., </em>62 Ohio St.3d at 81-82, 578 N.E.2d at 459. Here, New Crosset purchased virtually all of Old Crosset\u2019s assets, including real property, equipment, fixtures, certain contract rights, lease agreements, purchase orders, records, inventory, and accounts receivable. New Crosset even assumed $5 million worth of accounts payable, and operated under Old Crosset\u2019s trade <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>name. New Crosset satisfies <em>Lake Erie\u2019s </em>test to qualify as a successor in interest under R.C. 4123.32(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">In <em>Lake Erie, </em>this court expressly declined to adopt a narrower common-law definition of \u201csuccessor in interest\u201d of the type suggested by the majority here, and expressly rejected a proposed analogy to the definition of a \u201csuccessor corporation\u201d under the law of products liability. <em>Id., </em>62 Ohio St.3d at 83-84, 578 N.E.2d at 460-461. The <em>Lake Erie </em>court determined that there was no need to look beyond the workers\u2019 compensation provisions to the common law to define \u201csuccessor in interest\u201d for purposes of the workers\u2019 compensation statutes. <em>Id., </em>62 Ohio St.3d at 84, 578 N.E.2d at 460. We recently reaffirmed this portion of <em>Lake Erie </em>in <em>State ex rel. H.C.F. v. Ohio Bur. of Workers\u2019 Comp. </em>(1998), 80 Ohio St.3d 642, 648, 687 N.E.2d 763, 767.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">The majority\u2019s decision here, therefore, constitutes a significant deviation\u2014 rather than a distinction \u2014 from our holding in <em>Lake Erie. </em>The majority limits our decision in <em>Lake Erie </em>by straining to distinguish the <em>Lake Erie </em>holding based on the difference between successor liability for risk-experience rating and successor liability for retrospective-rating premiums. R.C. 4123.32(D), however, endorses no such distinction. Rather, the statute empowers the administrator to determine successor liability both for \u201crates to be applied\u201d and for \u201call contributions due.\u201d R.C. 4123.32(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">The majority takes a blue pencil to the language of the statute and inserts a new requirement that a transfer of the business by the employer be \u201cvoluntary\u201d and \u201cdirect\u201d in order to trigger the administrator\u2019s rulemaking authority embracing the liability of the successor employer. Under the majority\u2019s view, as long as a foreclosing bank comes between a predecessor employer and a successor employer, the administrator has no authority to ensure that the successor assumes the retrospective-rating claims costs of the predecessor\u2019s account. This result restricts the calculated authority delegated to the administrator under R.C. 4123.32(D) and the workers\u2019 compensation actuarial scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b592-9\">The majority supports its decision by declaring that \u201c[t]o label New Crosset a \u2018successor in interest,\u2019 as defined in <em>Lake Erie, </em>and thus hold New Crosset liable for Old Crosset\u2019s prior obligations, would, in our determination, be unjust.\u201d It is true, as the majority notes, that R.C. 4123.32(D) delegates authority to the administrator to adopt \u201c[sjuch special rules as the administrator considers necessary and that are <em>just </em>in the circumstances.\u201d (Emphasis added.) R.C. 4123.32(D). The majority, however, appears to make an <em>ad hoc </em>assessment of justice in the application of the rules without according the deference due \u201can administrative interpretation formulated by an agency which has accumulated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>substantial expertise, and to which the legislature has delegated the responsibility of implementing the legislative command.\u201d <em>State ex rel.
