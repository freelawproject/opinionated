Based upon our review, we affirm Cowans\u2019s convictions and sentence of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-10\">I. Request to Replace Appointed Counsel</p>\n<p id=\"b185-11\">In his first proposition of law, Cowans claims that a breakdown in communications between him and his court-appointed counsel was so serious as to entitle him to have new counsel appointed, and that the trial court\u2019s refusal to do so violated Cowans\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-12\">The trial court appointed two attorneys, including the Clermont County Public Defender, to represent Cowans. Cowans requested new counsel, claiming that the public defender was pressing an unwanted plea bargain upon him. The trial court granted this first request for new counsel, discharged the appointees, and chose Bruce S. Wallace and Michael P. Kelly to represent Cowans.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-13\">At a hearing on February 19, 1997 (about a month before voir dire began), Cowans asked the trial court to appoint new counsel to replace Wallace and Kelly. Cowans explained that he believed Wallace and Kelly thought he was guilty. Cowans also accused Wallace and Kelly of \u201cwanting me to plead guilty and lie * * When the court inquired about this allegation, Kelly stated that he and Wallace had never told Cowans that they thought he was guilty, and never asked \u2022 him to lie:</p>\n<p id=\"b185-14\">\u201c[Njever once has Mr. Wallace or I or Larry [Handorf, the court-appointed defense investigator] advised Mr. Cowans that we think he is guilty. At no time did that phrase ever pass between us. * * * [W]e did what all attorneys do with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>clients, discuss evidence and discuss theories. * * * We have given him theories of evidence. It is not unusual in theories \u2014 approaches to deal with evidence \u2014 it is not unusual for attorneys and clients to disagree on approaches, and we have had some differences on approaches. But we have not said those things, nor have we ever asked Mr. Cowans to tell an untruth under oath or any other wise [sic ].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">The trial court found that Cowans\u2019s attorneys were representing him diligently, and refused to appoint new counsel \u201cwithout more reasons\u201d than Cowans had given. Cowans\u2019s attorneys informed the court during the hearing that Cowans had \u201cdemanded that we file\u201d a motion to withdraw, and that therefore they would do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">Defense counsel filed a \u201cmotion for new counsel\u201d on Cowans\u2019s behalf, for the sole reason that Cowans lacked \u201cconfidence in his present counsel\u201d and therefore could not \u201cadequately communicate with counsel and assist in the presentation of his case.\u201d At a hearing, Kelly informed the court that he and Wallace had visited Cowans in jail to discuss the state\u2019s case against him and to propose a defense strategy. Kelly said, \u201c[T]here was a very loudly expressed dispute over some of those items\u201d; after that, Cowans refused to speak to his attorneys except to ask them to file a motion for new counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">Cowans told the court that he and his attorneys were \u201cnot getting along,\u201d and complained that Kelly \u201cwould come over to the jail * * * and talk to me about. that palm print.\u201d Cowans refused to explain further. The trial judge again denied the motion and indicated that he found no substantive reason why counsel should be replaced. Cowans told the court, \u201cI\u2019m not going to cooperate with this man.\u201d When the court denied Cowans\u2019s request, Cowans asked for a new judge. Cowans also indicated that he could not proceed <em>pro se </em>because he knew nothing about the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">On March 6, 1997, Kelly and Wallace filed a motion to withdraw on the ground that Cowans had refused to speak with them. This new motion stated that, although counsel had previously believed they could represent Cowans effectively, they could no longer do so. Having just learned of Cowans\u2019s incriminating statements to Napier, counsel now believed they could not adequately prepare to rebut that testimony without Cowans\u2019s cooperation.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-9\">Cowans contends that the trial court should have granted his motion for new counsel or the later motion of Wallace and Kelly to withdraw.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-10\">\u201cAn indigent defendant has no right to have a particular attorney represent him and therefore must demonstrate \u2018good cause\u2019 to warrant substitution of counsel.\u201d <em>United States v. Iles </em>(C.A.6, 1990), 906 F.2d 1122, 1130. \u201c[T]he trial judge may * * * [deny the requested substitution and] require the trial to proceed with assigned counsel participating if the complaint * * * is unreason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>able.\u201d <em>State v. Deal </em>(1969), 17 Ohio St.2d 17, 46 O.O.2d 154, 244 N.E.2d 742, syllabus. The trial court\u2019s decision is reviewed under an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Iles, </em>906 F.2d at 1130, fn. 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">Cowans\u2019s chief complaint was that his attorneys thought he was guilty. However, counsel deny ever expressing such a belief to Cowans. Even if counsel had explored plea options based on a belief that Cowans might be guilty, counsel\u2019s belief in their client\u2019s guilt is not good cause for substitution. \u201c \u2018A lawyer has a duty to give the accused an honest appraisal of his case. * * * Counsel has a duty to be candid; he has no duty to be optimistic when the facts do not warrant optimism.\u2019 \u201d <em>Brown v. United States </em>(C.A.D.C.1959), 264 F.2d 363, 369 <em>(en banc), </em>quoted in <em>McKee v. Harris </em>(C.A.2, 1981), 649 F.2d 927, 932. \u201c \u2018If the rule were otherwise, appointed counsel could be replaced for doing little more than giving their clients honest advice.\u2019 \u201d <em>McKee, </em>649 F.2d at 932, quoting <em>McKee v. Harris </em>(S.D.N.Y.1980), 485 F.Supp. 866, 869.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">For the same reasons, counsel\u2019s discussion of the palm print with Cowans was not good cause for substitution of counsel. Counsel would have rendered ineffective assistance had they <em>not </em>tried to discuss such important evidence with their client.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">Cowans also contends that the trial court should have given him new counsel because his refusal to speak with Kelly and Wallace rendered them unable to properly prepare his defense. Authority exists for the proposition that a \u201ccomplete breakdown in communication\u201d between the defendant and appointed counsel can constitute \u201cgood cause\u201d for substitution. See, <em>e.g., United States v. Calabro </em>(C.A.2, 1972), 467 F.2d 973, 986; cf. <em>Iles, </em>906 F.2d at 1130, fn. 8 (\u201ctotal lack of communication\u201d is a factor to be considered in determining whether trial court abused its discretion by denying substitution).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-9\">While the court could have found that there had been a <em>\u201ccomplete </em>breakdown\u201d or <em>\u201ctotal </em>lack of communication\u201d between Cowans and his counsel at the time counsel filed their motion to withdraw on March 6, the record indicates that this temporary lack of communication did not continue after the motion to withdraw was denied. \u201c[T]he record is replete with references to [counsel\u2019s] discussions with the defendant * * <em>Iles, supra, </em>at 1132. On March 24, 1997, when the jury was taken to view the crime scene, Cowans waived his right to be present in the following words: \u201cUnder the advice of my [c]ounsel, no, I waive that right, sir.\u201d This suggests that Cowans regarded his court-appointed attorneys as his counsel and shows that he considered their advice in making this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-10\">When Cowans missed part of the voir dire, one of his attorneys later went over the transcript of the missed hearing with him. When Cowans decided not to be present during the adjudication of the prior-conviction specification, counsel told the court that Cowans \u201cwas very cooperative * * * and was willing to discuss the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>matter with [counsel].\u201d On other occasions when Cowans waived his right to be present at hearings, the record indicates that he discussed this decision with counsel. The record also indicates that counsel reviewed the autopsy report with Cowans and discussed with him at length whether he should testify or remain silent. Finally, Cowans and his attorneys discussed \u201con several occasions\u201d his decisions to waive mitigation, forgo an unsworn statement, and wear his jail uniform to court.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">Under the circumstances of this case, we cannot find that the trial judge abused his discretion in denying substitution of counsel. Cowans\u2019s first proposition of law is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">II. Search by Parole Officer</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">When parole officer Higgins searched Cowans\u2019s home, she found evidence of his guilt \u2014 property stolen from Mrs. Swart. In his second proposition of law, Cowans claims this evidence should have been suppressed. Cowans contends that Higgins\u2019s warrantless search of his home violated the Fourth Amendment, because the parole officer was acting on behalf of the police to perform a search that police could not lawfully have performed themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-8\">On September 2, 1996, Higgins went to the Clermont County Sheriffs Office to help investigators obtain Cowans\u2019s fingerprints. After discussing the fingerprints with Higgins, deputies asked her to come with them to the crime scene. She rode with the deputies, leaving her car behind. Investigator Barry Jacobson went on to Cowans\u2019s house; Higgins waited outside Mrs. Swart\u2019s house with the other deputies.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-9\">When Jacobson returned, he told Higgins and the deputies that he had spoken with Cowans\u2019s wife inside the house. Jacobson said he had \u201clooked around\u201d but had seen no incriminating evidence in plain sight. He told Higgins \u201cthat they had decided not to conduct any more search [and] didn\u2019t think there was anything they could do.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b188-10\">Jacobson also said that Cowans had not come home the night before, and that Cowans\u2019s wife had indicated that Cowans might have gone to Kentucky. Higgins found this news \u201calarming\u201d because she knew, from an earlier conversation with Cowans, that he wanted to move to Kentucky.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-11\">Higgins thereupon \u201cinformed the deputies that it was my duty to go back and search the residence.\u201d The deputies did not ask her to do so, she testified; she made this decision \u201con [her] own.\u201d Two deputies went along; Higgins testified that it is usual for law enforcement officers to accompany parole officers on searches.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>Higgins told Mrs. Cowans that she was there to conduct a search. Mrs. Cowans admitted Higgins and the deputies and showed them to Cowans\u2019s bedroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">Higgins testified that she conducted the search personally, although the deputies helped. She found marijuana, which she testified caused her \u201csome concern.\u201d A deputy found the clown figurine. The figurine, Higgins testified, \u201cdidn\u2019t cause me any concern [at first] because I didn\u2019t know what it was.\u201d (Higgins apparently knew that a clown figurine had been stolen but erroneously thought the stolen figure was smaller.) The deputies warned her not to touch it. Higgins testified that she would not have seized the clown had the deputies not been there.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">Although she did not \u201cphysically take hold of\u2019 the clown, Higgins testified that she was responsible for its seizure: \u201cI seized it * * * [b]ecause I was the one conducting the search * * * .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">Higgins \u201ccontinued to search for a few more minutes\u201d; then the deputies summoned Jacobson. After Jacobson arrived, the search continued with Mrs. Cowans\u2019s written consent, and deputies found the little wooden car in Cowans\u2019s bedroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-9\">After a hearing, at which Higgins was the sole witness, the trial court denied Cowans\u2019s motion to suppress the fruits of Higgins\u2019s search. Cowans contends that the clown and car should have been suppressed because Higgins\u2019s search violated the Fourth Amendment. Although the car was found as part of Jacobson\u2019s search, after Mrs. Cowans consented thereto, Cowans contends it was inadmissible as well, since the deputies would not have obtained Mrs. Cowans\u2019s consent to search further had they not first found the clown.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-10\">Cowans concedes that a probation officer may search a probationer\u2019s home without a warrant and upon less than probable cause. See <em>Griffin v. Wisconsin </em>(1987), 483 U.S. 868, 877-878, 107 S.Ct. 3164, 3170-3171, 97 L.Ed.2d 709, 719-720. Moreover, the same rule applies to a parole officer\u2019s search of a parolee\u2019s home. See, <em>e.g., United States v. Hill </em>(C.A.3, 1992), 967 F.2d 902, 909-910; <em>Latta v. Fitzharris </em>(C.A.9, 1975), 521 F.2d 246, 249-251.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-11\">Nonetheless, Cowans argues that Higgins\u2019s search was illegal because Higgins was not acting \u201cto achieve her own legitimate objectives.\u201d Rather, he claims, the deputies investigating the murder were using Higgins as a \u201cstalking horse\u201d to perform a search they could not lawfully perform themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-12\">If law enforcement rather than parole supervision was the primary purpose of Higgins\u2019s search, many authorities would indeed hold the search illegal. \u201c[A] probation [or parole] search may not be used as a subterfuge for a criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>investigation.\u201d <em>United States v. Watts </em>(C.A.9, 1995), 67 F.3d 790, 793-794, citing <em>Latta, supra. </em>Accord <em>United States v. Martin </em>(C.A.6, 1994), 25 F.3d 293, 296.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">We recognize that after <em>Whren v. United States </em>(1996), 517 U.S. 806, 116 S.Ct. 1769, 135 L.Ed.2d 89, the Fourth Amendment does not forbid \u201cpretextual\u201d searches. See <em>United States v. Conway </em>(C.A.9, 1997), 122 F.3d 841, 845 (concurring opinion); <em>People v. Woods </em>(1999), 21 Cal.4th 668, 88 Cal.Rptr.2d 88, 981 P.2d 1019. However, the pretext doctrine may still apply to searches not requiring probable cause, such as searches by parole officers. See 4 LaFave, Search &amp; Seizure (3 Ed.1996) (Supp.1999), at 78-79, Section 10.10. For purposes of this opinion, we assume it does.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">Based upon the testimony presented and the trial court\u2019s assessment of the credibility of the witnesses, the trial court made a factual finding that Higgins was <em>not </em>acting as a stalking horse for the deputies. Instead, the court found, she \u201chad her own objectives in conducting the search.\u201d We are bound by that finding unless the record contains insufficient evidence to support it. We find,.in this case, that there was sufficient evidence on the record to support the trial court\u2019s finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">Higgins testified that she made the decision to search by herself: \u201cI was the one conducting the search[;] it was my search.\u201d There is no evidence that the deputies asked or encouraged Higgins to search. Cowans argues that Jacobson \u201cwas more than happy to provide assistance\u201d to Higgins. But Jacobson did not testify at the suppression hearing, and the hearing record contains no basis for speculation about his state of mind. Besides, it is Higgins\u2019s, not Jacobson\u2019s, state of mind that is at issue. See <em>State v. Hill </em>(App.1983), 136 Ariz. 347, 349, 666 P.2d 92, 94. The question is whether Higgins was trying to investigate possible parole violations or to help the deputies circumvent the warrant requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">Cowans argues that Higgins\u2019s seizure of the clown shows that her purpose was not really parole supervision, since she would not have seized it had the deputies not been there to explain its significance to the murder investigation. But, since the murder was a parole violation as well as a crime, the clown was evidence of a parole violation; hence, her seizing the clown does not necessarily suggest an ulterior law-enforcement motive. The trial court could have drawn that inference, perhaps, but it did not, and thus we cannot.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-9\">Nor does the deputies\u2019 assistance taint Higgins\u2019s search. \u201c[Collaboration between a [parole or] probation officer and police does not in itself render a [parole or] probation search unlawful.\u201d <em>Watts, supra, </em>67 F.3d at 794. Accord <em>United States v. Cardona </em>(C.A.1, 1990), 903 F.2d 60, 66; <em>United States v. Coleman </em>(C.A.7, 1994), 22 F.3d 126, 129; <em>United States v. Butcher </em>(C.A.9, 1991), 926 F.2d 811, 815, quoting <em>People v. Kanos </em>(1971), 14 Cal.App.3d 642, 649, 92 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>Cal.Rptr. 614, 617. See, generally, LaFave, <em>supra, </em>at 792-793, Section 10.10(e); 2 Hall, Search &amp; Seizure (2 Ed.1993) 213, Section 25:17.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">Admittedly, \u201cit \u2018is often difficult to distinguish cases of valid cooperation from cases of impermissible collusion between parole and police authorities.\u2019\u201d LaFave, <em>supra, </em>at 795, quoting Note (1976), 51 N.Y.U.L.Rev. 800, 829. But Higgins testified that she conceived and executed the search and that her concern was with parole violations, and the trial judge believed her. As the determinations rest mainly on the trial court\u2019s assessment of witness credibility, we defer to the finding and overrule Cowans\u2019s second proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">III. Video of Bloodhound\u2019s Path</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">When Deputy DeCamp and the bloodhound attempted to track Cowans\u2019s scent from Mrs. Swart\u2019s house, Investigator Mike Robinson went with them. A week later, Robinson retraced their path, making a videotape as he walked to illustrate the general path the dog had taken in following the scent. The videotape was introduced at trial, supported by testimony by Robinson. In his third proposition, Cowans contends that this video was irrelevant and unfairly prejudicial because it was not an exact illustration of the dog\u2019s path.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-9\">Cowans points out that the dog lost the scent at least once, relatively early on in the tracking and had to be rescented, an event not shown on the video. The record indicates that the dog lost the scent at least twice during the tracking process. Moreover, Robinson\u2019s path as shown on the video was more direct and admittedly faster than the dog\u2019s route.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-10\">Nevertheless, introduction of the video was not so prejudicial that its admission rises to the level of an abuse of discretion. The video showed only the general contours of the dog\u2019s path, and the officer readily admitted this. Robinson fully explained to the jury that the video did not precisely show each deviation in the dog\u2019s path. \u201cAn exhibit is not necessarily incompetent because it fails to show some exact thing in connection with the subject under investigation, provided it shows some matter bearing directly upon the matter under investigation, with an explanation of how it differs from that which is being investigated.\u201d <em>Cleveland Provision Co. v. Hague </em>(1912), 20 Ohio C.C.(N.S.) 34, 41 Ohio C.C. 223, 230, affirmed (1912), 87 Ohio St. 483, 102 N.E. 1121. See, also, <em>State v. Palmer </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 543, 564-566, 687 N.E.2d 685, 704-705.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-11\">When an exhibit is offered for purposes of illustration, the trial court has discretion to determine whether it is helpful or misleading to the trier of fact. See, generally, <em>Palmer, </em>80 Ohio St.3d at 566, 687 N.E.2d at 705; 2 McCormick on Evidence (4 Ed. Strong Ed.1992) 9-10, Section 212. Cowans has not shown an abuse of discretion. Consequently, his third proposition is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>IV. Evidence of Defendant\u2019s Status as Parolee</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">In his fourth proposition, Cowans contends that evidence of his status as a parolee should have been excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">The defense filed a motion <em>in limine </em>to preclude the state from introducing evidence of Cowans\u2019s previous murder as a \u201csimilar act\u201d under Evid.R. 404(B). The trial court granted the motion. Cowans also elected to try the R.C. 2929.04(A)(5) prior murder specification to the court under R.C. 2929.022(A). Accordingly, there was no direct reference during the guilt phase to Cowans\u2019s prior conviction. The trial court did, however, permit Higgins to testify that she was Cowans\u2019s parole officer. Cowans contends that this testimony \u201cundercut\u201d the trial court\u2019s earlier ruling and prejudiced him.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">We cannot agree. At no time during the guilt phase did the trial court, the parties, or any witness refer to the basis for Cowans\u2019s parolee status. The jury was informed only that Cowans was a parolee. The jury never learned that he had a prior murder conviction or even a felony conviction until the sentencing phase. In addition, the trial court instructed the jury not to consider Cowans\u2019s parolee status as character evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">Moreover, Cowans\u2019s status as a parolee was relevant in the guilt phase, even though the nature of his previous crime was not. Higgins searched Cowans\u2019s house and.found property that had been stolen from Mrs. Swart. Higgins was able to search Cowans\u2019s house because she was his parole officer. Without knowing her relationship to Cowans, the jury could not have understood why Higgins was searching Cowans\u2019s house. Cf. <em>State v. Allen </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 626, 632, 653 N.E.2d 675, 683. Thus, Higgins\u2019s position as Cowans\u2019s parole officer was, as the trial court put it, \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d with her testimony about the search. Accordingly, Cowans\u2019s fourth proposition is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-9\">V. Stacking Inferences</p>\n<p id=\"b192-10\">In his fifth proposition of law, Cowans contends that State\u2019s Exhibit 58, a photograph showing a BB pistol in Cowans\u2019s truck, was inadmissible because the state\u2019s theory as to the relevance of the pistol required the jury to draw an inference from another inference.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-11\">A trier of fact may not draw \u201c[a]n inference based * * * entirely upon another inference, unsupported by any additional fact or another inference from other facts[.]\u201d <em>Hurt v. Charles J. Rogers Transp. Co. </em>(1955), 164 Ohio St. 329, 58 O.O. 122, 130 N.E.2d 820, paragraph one of the syllabus. However, \u201c[a]n inference * * * based in part upon another inference and in part upon facts is a parallel inference and, if reasonable, may be indulged in * * * .\u201d <em>Id., </em>paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>Cowans argues that the state began with a fact \u2014 the absence of defense wounds \u2014 and from that fact drew an inference that Mrs. Swart\u2019s killer used a weapon to subdue her. Then, Cowans argues, the state drew a second inference \u2014 that the BB gun found in Cowans truck was the weapon used.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">We agree. The state\u2019s theory involves a string of inferences. First, the state must infer from the lack of defensive wounds that Mrs. Swart was somehow frightened into submission. Second, the state infers from the testimony of Cowans\u2019s wife that Cowans, at some time, had possession of the BB gun found in his truck. From these two inferences, which are admittedly supported by separate and independent facts, the state builds its theory with additional inferences, unsupported by additional facts or reasonable parallel inferences. In order to connect the gun to the crime, the state must infer that Cowans had possession of the gun on the day of the crime, that he carried the gun to Mrs. Swart\u2019s residence, that he brandished the gun, and that the gun caused Mrs. Swart to submit to Cowans during her own murder by strangulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">The state argues that the second inference (that Cowans used the BB gun found in the truck during the crime) is not based entirely upon the first inference (that a weapon was used to subdue Mrs. Swart) but upon three additional facts. First, the dog tracked Cowans\u2019s scent from Mrs. Swart\u2019s house to the truck; and second, the gun was found in the truck; and third, that gun was not ordinarily kept in the truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">The first alleged fact is that the dog tracked Cowans\u2019s scent from Mrs. Swart\u2019s house to the truck. However, this is in itself an inference rather than a fact. The record contains ample testimony from the state\u2019s witness acknowledging that an officer can only infer that the dog is following the scent it was asked to follow even under the best of circumstances. Further, in setting forth this proposition, the state ignores the fact that at least twice between the Swart residence and the truck, the dog lost Cowans\u2019s scent and had to be rescented with his shirt. Compounding this, the last time the dog was rescented it was near Cowans\u2019s property line in an area he was known to have frequented and from there appeared to track his scent to the truck. Without some additional factual basis, the state\u2019s conclusion that this last portion of the tracking somehow connects the truck to Cowans on the day of the murder is an unreasonable inference.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-9\">Absent any direct connection between the truck and the Swart residence, the fact that a BB gun was found in the truck does not support a reasonable inference that Cowans used the gun to intimidate Mrs. Swart during the course of a murder. Third, the fact that the gun was normally kept in a drawer could support an inference that Cowans moved the gun to the truck, but it does not establish it as fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>Because we agree that the state\u2019s theory regarding the gun\u2019s relevance would require the factfinder to draw an inference from an inference, we find merit in Cowans\u2019s contention that the picture of the gun was impermissibly admitted into evidence. We also, however, hold that under the facts of this case, the admission was harmless error. Because the use of a gun was not a critical element of the crime, and because the state advanced other theories of why Mrs. Swart may not have suffered defensive wounds, which were supported by admissible evidence, we find that admitting the picture of the BB gun was harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">VI. Defendant\u2019s Refusal to Present Mitigation</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">After the jury found him guilty, Cowans specifically refused to let his counsel present any evidence in mitigation; moreover, he instructed his family and 'friends not to cooperate with his defense team\u2019s efforts to find mitigating evidence. Cowans also declined to make an unsworn statement to the jury, explaining that he did not trust \u201ca jury that found me guilty on something I didn\u2019t do\u201d to give him \u201ca fair shake.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">Cowans\u2019s refusal to present any mitigating evidence in the penalty phase is the subject of his sixth, seventh, and eighth propositions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">A. Eighth Amendment</p>\n<p id=\"b194-9\">Cowans in his sixth proposition of law argues that the Eighth Amendment forbids the imposition of a death sentence by a sentencer who has not been apprised of possible mitigating factors, even where the defendant himself opposed their presentation. That, however, is an argument we have rejected. The Eighth Amendment compels no one to present mitigation against his will. See <em>State v. Tyler </em>(1990), 50 Ohio St.3d 24, 27-29, 553 N.E.2d 576, 583-586; <em>State v. Ashworth </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 56, 61-66, 706 N.E.2d 1231, 1236-1239.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-10\">Indeed, we recently noted in <em>Ashworth, </em>85 Ohio St.3d at 63, 706 N.E.2d at 1237-1238, that \u201ca rule requiring the presentation of mitigating evidence would be impossible to enforce,\u201d because no court could compel a defendant to cooperate with his counsel in gathering and presenting such evidence. This case aptly illustrates the point: Cowans not only refused to present mitigating evidence, he actually blocked his counsel\u2019s acquisition of such evidence by instructing his family and friends not to cooperate with counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-11\">B. Ineffective Assistance</p>\n<p id=\"b194-12\">In his seventh proposition of law, Cowans contends that, by acquiescing in his instructions not to' present mitigating evidence, his counsel denied him their effective assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-13\">Cowans concedes that legal ethics normally require an attorney to \u201cabide by a client\u2019s decisions concerning the objectives of representation.\u201d ABA Model Rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>of Professional Conduct 1.2(a). - Indeed, DR 7-101(A)(1) provides: \u201cA lawyer shall not intentionally * * * [flail to seek the lawful objectives of his client through reasonably available means permitted by law and the Disciplinary Rules * \u2756 \u00bb</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">Despite this, Cowans argues that counsel\u2019s obligation to present mitigation in a capital case supersedes the obligation to let the client choose his own course of action.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">We disagree. Like other courts, we have rejected the notion that an attorney renders ineffective assistance by declining, in deference to a client\u2019s desires, to present mitigation. <em>Tyler, supra; State v. Keith </em>(1997), 79 Ohio St.3d 514, 536-537, 684 N.E.2d 47, 67. Accord <em>State v. Koedatich </em>(1988), 112 N.J. 225, 332-335, 548 A.2d 939, 995-996; <em>Kirksey v. State </em>(1996), 112 Nev. 980, 995-996, 923 P.2d 1102, 1112, and cases cited therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">C. Validity of Waiver</p>\n<p id=\"b195-9\">In his eighth proposition of law, Cowans contends that the trial court should have (1) held a hearing to determine his competence to waive mitigation, and (2) taken steps to ensure that his waiver was knowing and voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-10\">1. Competence</p>\n<p id=\"b195-11\">The principal contention of Cowans\u2019s eighth proposition is that, whenever a capital defendant declines to present evidence in mitigation, the trial court must determine on the record whether he has the mental capacity to appreciate his position and make a rational choice with respect to presenting mitigation- <em>vel non.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b195-12\">However, a capital defendant\u2019s decision to forgo mitigation \u201cdoes not by itself call his competence into question.\u201d <em>Tyler, </em>50 Ohio St.3d at 29, 553 N.E.2d at 585. Accord <em>State v. Berry </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 354, 361, 650 N.E.2d 433, 440 <em>(Berry I). </em>Therefore, \u201cabsent a request by counsel, or any indicia of incompetence, a competency evaluation is not required.\u201d <em>Ashworth, supra, </em>85 Ohio St.3d at 62, 706 N.E.2d at 1237, citing <em>Tyler, </em>50 Ohio St.3d at 29, 553 N.E.2d at 585.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-13\">Cowans argues that <em>Tyler </em>is inconsistent with our recent decision in <em>State v. Berry </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 371, 686 N.E.2d 1097 <em>(Berry II). </em>In <em>Berry II, </em>a condemned prisoner, having exhausted his direct appeals, wished to waive further challenge to his convictions and sentence. We ordered a hearing on the issue of Berry\u2019s competence and found him competent only after reviewing the hearing record.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>When a capital defendant decides to waive his right to present mitigation <em>(Tyler), </em>or to review of a conviction and sentence <em>(Berry II), </em>a court must inquire into his competence to do so if some reason, <em>other than that decision, </em>exists to question competence. Thus, in <em>Rees v. Peyton </em>(1966), 384 U.S. 312, 86 S.Ct. 1505, 16 L.Ed.2d 583, the court denied a condemned prisoner leave to withdraw his certiorari petition, since his attorney had submitted a psychiatric report calling the prisoner\u2019s competence into question.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">Conversely, where no independent reason to question competence exists, no hearing is required. Thus, in <em>Hammett v. Texas </em>(1980), 448 U.S. 725, 100 S.Ct. 2905, 65 L.Ed.2d 1086, the court permitted a condemned prisoner to withdraw his petition; the difference was that nobody questioned Hammett\u2019s competence. The decision to forgo challenging his death sentence was not sufficient of itself to require an evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\"><em>Tyler </em>is no more inconsistent with <em>Berry II </em>than <em>Hammett </em>is with <em>Rees. </em>In <em>Berry II </em>we had reason to question Berry\u2019s competence other than his desire to be executed, that being Berry\u2019s history of hallucinations and a diagnosis of a psychotic disorder before his aggravated murder trial. 80 Ohio St.3d at 377, 686 N.E.2d at 1102; see, also, <em>Berry I, </em>72 Ohio St.3d at 367, 650 N.E.2d at 444 (Wright, J., dissenting). In <em>Tyler, </em>on the other hand, there was nothing in the record to raise any question as to the defendant\u2019s competence. 50 Ohio St.3d at 29 and 38-39, 553 N.E.2d at 585 and 593-594.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">Hence, we reject Cowans\u2019s claim that a trial court must always inquire into the competence of defendants who refuse to present mitigation. No such inquiry need take place unless some reason exists to doubt the defendant\u2019s competence.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">It remains to ask whether, in this case, anything in the record actually raised a question as to Cowans\u2019s competence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On this point, we take our guidance from the trial judge, who stated in his sentencing- opinion that Cowans \u201cevidenced no mental instability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b196-9\">The record shows, and the trial judge noted in his opinion, that Cowans was uncooperative and disruptive at certain times during this case. At the beginning of the case, Cowans expressed a belief that he had no chance of a fair trial because his first set of assigned counsel thought he was guilty. He asked that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>counsel be replaced because they allegedly discussed plea-bargain options with him, and he expressed a fear that the originally appointed counsel would control anyone else from that counsel\u2019s office, so that appointing new counsel from the same office would be \u201cjust like hanging me * *</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">After the court appointed new counsel, Cowans proceeded to challenge these counsel as well, claiming they were trying to pressure him into pleading guilty. When the court refused Cowans\u2019s second request for new counsel, Cowans refused to accept the court\u2019s decision and stood up as if to leave the courtroom. When the trial judge asked Cowans for his assurance that he would not be disruptive, Cowans repeated his demand for new counsel rather than answering. The judge therefore had him removed.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">Brought back to court for a subsequent hearing, Cowans doggedly repeated his demands for new counsel, accused the judge of bias, and became angry because someone was, or appeared to be, laughing at him.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">Subsequently, however, Cowans cooperated with his counsel (see discussion of Cowans\u2019s first proposition of law, <em>supra) </em>and created no further problems until the guilt-phase verdicts were read. When Cowans found that he had been convicted, he directed a profane outburst at the court and jury, and then expressed his wish to leave the courtroom. The court ordered Cowans taken to a room in the courthouse basement equipped with closed-circuit TV and audio, so he could see and hear the rest of the proceedings. After the jurors returned to the jury room, a deputy reported to the judge that Cowans had disabled the TV and was asking to be taken back to jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">Next, Cowans refused to take part in the R.C. 2929.022 evidentiary hearing on the prior-conviction specification. His counsel explained that Cowans wished to boycott the remainder of the trial because he felt that \u201cthe jury that\u2019s already found him guilty of 20 counts * * * would be biased against him when it came to any mitigation,\u201d and that the court was also biased.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">The trial court ordered that Cowans be returned to the basement room with the closed-circuit TV. In disrespectful and sometimes foul language, Cowans protested that he regarded the court as a \u201ckangaroo court\u201d and did not want to be in the courthouse at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-9\">Minutes later, Cowans\u2019s counsel informed the court that Cowans was refusing to watch the proceedings and was demanding that the audio be turned down. He was also physically resisting the three deputies guarding him.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-10\">Despite this behavior, the trial judge found, \u201cWhile disruptive, the Defendant <em>evidenced no mental instability but rather acted out his pique.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>In a wide variety of situations, we have affirmed that factual determinations are best left to those who see and hear what goes on in the courtroom. See, <em>e.g., State v. Wilson </em>(1972), 29 Ohio St.2d 203, 211, 58 O.O.2d 409, 414, 280 N.E.2d 915, 920 (deferring to trial judge\u2019s determination of challenge for cause); <em>State v. Fanning </em>(1982), 1 Ohio St.3d 19, 20,1 OBR 57, 58, 437 N.E.2d 583, 584 (weight of evidence and witness credibility are for trier of fact); <em>State v. Morales </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 252, 255, 513 N.E.2d 267, 271 (effect on jury of spectator\u2019s emotional outburst is fact question for trial court); <em>State v. Bradley </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 143, 538 N.E.2d 373, 381 (trial counsel were in better position than reviewing court to determine how jurors should be questioned).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">Similarly, when a trial court must decide whether to hold a hearing on the defendant\u2019s competence to stand trial, reviewing courts \u201cgive weight * * * to the trial judge\u2019s opportunity to observe the defendant * * <em>Commonwealth v. Hall </em>(1982), 15 Mass.App. 1, 3, 443 N.E.2d 121, 122.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\"><em>Maggio v. Fulford </em>(1983), 462 U.S. 111, 117, 103 S.Ct. 2261, 2264, 76 L.Ed.2d 794, 799-800, illustrates the principle. There, it was held that \u201c[t]he trial judge\u2019s observation of [the defendant\u2019s] conduct\u201d provided record support for the conclusion that \u201cthere was insufficient question as to [the defendant\u2019s] competence to warrant\u201d further inquiry. Accord <em>People v. Danielson </em>(1992), 3 Cal.4th 691, 727, 13 Cal.Rptr.2d 1, 21, 838 P.2d 729, 749; <em>People v. Morino </em>(Colo.App.1987), 743 P.2d 49, 52; <em>State v. Zorzy </em>(1993), 136 N.H. 710, 715, 622 A.2d 1217, 1219-1220; <em>State v. Edwards </em>(S.D.1997), 572 N.W.2d 113, 117-118.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">We think the trial court\u2019s factual finding in this case ought to receive the same respect. \u201cFace to face with living witnesses, the original trier of the facts holds a position of advantage from which appellate judges are excluded. * * * How can we say the judge is wrong? We never saw the witnesses.\u201d <em>Boyd v. Boyd </em>(1930), 252 N.Y. 422, 429, 169 N.E. 632, 634.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">Likewise, we never saw Cowans, and thus can hardly say that the trial judge here was wrong when he said that Cowans \u201cevidenced no mental instability.\u201d Limited to reviewing the black-and-white record, we are in no position to second-guess factual determinations made by a trial judge, which may be based on a person\u2019s demeanor, conduct, gestures, tone of voice, or facial expressions. (The judge here took specific notice of Cowans\u2019s demeanor, which \u201cwould range from smiling and relaxed * * * to angry and vocal when he was denied a request or his position was challenged.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b198-9\">Indeed, it is noteworthy that <em>nobody </em>on the spot thought Cowans\u2019s behavior raised any question as to his competence. Defense counsel, who appear to have done a diligent job of defending a difficult client, made no suggestion that Cowans might lack the competence to waive mitigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>That competence, as we have recently held, is measured by the following test: \u201cA [capital] defendant is mentally competent to forgo the presentation of mitigating evidence * * * if he has the mental capacity to understand the choice between life and death and to make a knowing and intelligent decision not to pursue the presentation of evidence. The defendant must fully comprehend the ramifications of his decision and must possess the ability to reason logically, <em>i.e., </em>to choose means that relate logically to his ends.\u201d <em>Ashworth, </em>85 Ohio St.3d at 69, 706 N.E.2d at 1241.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">The defendant\u2019s behavior here did not inherently r\u00e1ise questions concerning his capacity to understand the difference between life and death, to fully comprehend the ramifications of his decision, or to reason logically. Moreover, the trial judge, based on his observations of this defendant, and having the defendant\u2019s displays of temper in mind, found that these displays resulted from pique, not mental instability. Thus, in order to find error, we would have to second-guess the express factual determination of the trial judge. This we decline to do. We therefore find that the trial court was not required to order a competency hearing <em>sua sponte.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">2. Knowing and Voluntary Waiver</p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">Cowans also suggests, in this proposition of law, that the trial court failed to determine whether his waiver of the right to present mitigating evidence was knowing and voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-9\">In <em>State v. Ashworth </em>(1999), <em>supra, </em>at paragraph one of the syllabus, we held that a waiver of the presentation of mitigating evidence must be knowing and voluntary, and that to ensure this, the trial court must conduct an inquiry of the defendant on the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-10\">Pursuant to <em>Ashworth, </em>the record must affirmatively demonstrate that (1) the court has informed the defendant of the right to present mitigating evidence, (2) the court has explained what mitigating evidence is, (3) the defendant understands the importance of mitigating evidence, (4) the defendant understands the use of mitigating evidence to offset the aggravating circumstances, (5) the defendant understands the effect of failing to present mitigating evidence, and (6) the defendant wishes to waive mitigation. <em>Ashworth </em>at 62, 706 N.E.2d at 1237.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-11\">Our primary reason for requiring this procedure was to ensure that a defendant understood the importance of presenting mitigating evidence, discussed these issues with counsel, and confirmed in open court that he or she wished to waive presentation of mitigating evidence. Only then could the trial court, and this court, be assured that the defendant knowingly and voluntarily waived this substantial and important right to show the jury or three-judge panel why the death penalty should not be imposed in his or her particular case.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>Although the trial court in this case did not have the benefit of our decision in <em>Ashworth, </em>the procedures used in this case to advise Cowans of the potential consequences of his decision were substantially similar to those adopted in <em>Ashworth. </em>The transcripts of the sentencing hearing reflect that the court engaged in communications with the defendant over a two-day period. These communications included apprising him that he had a right to present testimony and make a statement, explaining to him that his attorneys had prepared to present witnesses, inquiring why Cowans did not want to present mitigating evidence, and informing him that if he presented no evidence the jury would probably impose the death penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">This colloquy complies with many of the requirements set forth in <em>Ashworth. </em>Further, defense counsel stated that they had discussed the issue with Cowans and that he had not arrived at his decision lightly.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">Yet, the trial court failed to address all six <em>Ashworth </em>requirements in its colloquy with Cowans. Most notably, there was no explanation of what mitigating evidence is, and no finding on the record that Cowans fully understood the ramifications of failing to present mitigating evidence or desired to waive his rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">While this procedure fell short of that established in <em>Ashworth, </em>we hold that our ruling in <em>Ashworth </em>is prospective only. We cannot hold the trial court accountable for not following a procedure that was not established, or even foreshadowed, when the case was tried.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-8\">We are not holding today that substantial compliance is enough to satisfy the requirements of <em>Ashworth; </em>however, the trial court here, like the trial court in <em>Ashworth, </em>did engage the defendant in a colloquy concerning the waiver of mitigation, even though no guidelines were in place when Cowans was tried. Given the content of the trial court\u2019s colloquy, there is nothing to indicate that Cowans did not knowingly and voluntarily relinquish his right to present mitigating evidence. Since the decision in <em>Ashworth </em>is prospective only, the failure to comply with <em>all </em>of the procedural requirements set forth in <em>Ashworth </em>is not error in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-9\">To sum up: Cowans\u2019s desire to waive mitigation did not automatically require a competency hearing, nor did the record create a doubt as to his competence such as to require a competency hearing; the record indicates that Cowans\u2019s waiver was knowing and voluntary; and, although the specific procedural requirements of <em>State v. Ashworth </em>were not complied with in full, they are prospective only and hence do not apply here. Accordingly, Cowans\u2019s eighth proposition of law is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>VII. Other Issues</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">In his ninth proposition of law, Cowans complains that the guilt-phase evidence was reintroduced in the penalty phase.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">However, the trial court may admit evidence raised at trial that is relevant to the nature and circumstances of the aggravating circumstances in the penalty phase. See <em>State v. DePew </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 275, 528 N.E.2d 542, paragraph one of the syllabus; <em>State v. Mason </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 144, 165, 694 N.E.2d 932, 954, citing <em>State v. Woodard </em>(1993), 68 Ohio St.3d 70, 78, 623 N.E.2d 75, 81. At trial, Cowans did not identify any specific evidence to which he objected. Thus, he has waived any objection relating to the relevance of specific items. Cf. <em>State v. Getsy </em>(1998), 84 Ohio St.3d 180, 201, 702 N.E.2d 866, 887.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">In his tenth proposition of law, Cowans raises already-settled issues about the constitutionality of Ohio\u2019s death-penalty statutes. These issues are summarily overruled. See, generally, <em>State v. Poindexter </em>(1988), 36 Ohio St.3d 1, 520 N.E.2d 568; <em>State v. Spisak </em>(1988), 36 Ohio St.3d 80, 521 N.E.2d 800.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-9\">VIII. Independent Review</p>\n<p id=\"b201-10\">We must now independently review Cowans\u2019s death sentence. Initially, we note that the four counts of aggravated murder, all of which involved the same victim, merge. See, <em>e.g., State v. Huertas </em>(1990), 51 Ohio St.3d 22, 28, 553 N.E.2d 1058, 1066.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-11\">R.C. 2929.05(A) requires that we determine whether the evidence supports the finding of aggravating circumstances, whether the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt, and whether the death sentence is proportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-12\">The evidence supports the finding of aggravating circumstances. Cowans was convicted of an aggravating circumstance under R.C. 2929.04(A)(5) \u2014 having a prior conviction of an offense involving \u201cthe purposeful killing of or attempt to kill another * * Cowans had been convicted of murder, R.C. 2903.02, in 1978. The state proved this specification with a certified copy of the judgment of conviction and the testimony of Cowans\u2019s parole officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-13\">Cowans was also convicted of three separate aggravating circumstances under R.C. 2929.04(A)(7): aggravated burglary, aggravated robbery, and kidnapping. The evidence supports the finding of these aggravating circumstances as well. There can be no doubt that Clara Swart \u2014 tied up, robbed, and murdered in her own home \u2014 was the victim of a kidnapping, aggravated robbery, and aggravated burglary.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-14\">The evidence was more than sufficient to prove that Cowans committed these acts. Items belonging to Mrs. Swart were found inside Cowans\u2019s house and on or near his property. The bloodhound tracked Cowans\u2019s scent from .Mrs. Swart\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>house to the tree where some of the victim\u2019s personal, property had been dumped, and from there to Cowans\u2019s truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">Cowans\u2019s palm print on the plastic bag places him inside Mrs. Swart\u2019s house. Yet Cowans did not enter the house on the July day when he took the discarded swing, and it is unlikely that he went inside on August 28, the day of Kilgore\u2019s visit. Since that was the day Mrs. Swart told Kilgore she was afraid of Cowans, one can reasonably infer that she had not invited him in.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">Cowans tried to mislead Deputy Evans by implying that he was at Mrs. Swart\u2019s house only once. He also hinted to Mamie Trammel that she should say that he was at her house on the morning of August 29, which Trammel testified was not so. Cowans stated twice (to Trammel and to Evans) that Mrs. Swart had been \u201chung,\u201d a detail not disclosed to the news media. Finally, he admitted his guilt to Marvin Napier.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">Cowans expressly refused to present any mitigation or make an unsworn statement in the penalty phase. Nor have we found in the guilt phase any of the other mitigating factors listed in R.C. 2929.04(B)(1) through (B)(6). Nor do we find therein any other reason not to sentence Cowans to death. See R.C. 2929.04(B)(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">Nothing in the nature and circumstances of this case, as revealed at the guilt phase, constitutes a mitigating factor. The record shows that Cowans was unemployed at the time of the murder and wanted to leave Ohio, but this deserves no weight in mitigation. The record shows that Cowans once worked at a restaurant in Kentucky, but there is no evidence concerning his work record or any other evidence going to his history or background.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">We note that Cowans\u2019s wife testified on his behalf in the guilt phase. We infer that she loves him, and that is a mitigating factor, but it deserves no appreciable weight in this case. We also agree with the trial court that Cowans\u2019s kindness to animals deserves no weight in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-9\">The state proved four aggravating circumstances at trial. Cowans is a recidivist murderer who invaded his victim\u2019s home, tied her up, and killed her to steal a few trinkets. Mitigation is nearly nonexistent. We conclude that the aggravating circumstances in this case outweigh any mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-10\">Cowans\u2019s death sentence, we find, is proportionate to sentences approved in similar cases. See <em>State v. Tyler, supra </em>(robbery-murder); <em>State v. Jackson </em>(1991), 57 Ohio St.3d 29, 565 N.E.2d 549 (robbery-murder); <em>State v. Waddy </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 424, 588 N.E.2d 819 (kidnapping, aggravated burglary); <em>State v. Cook </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 516, 605 N.E.2d 70 (kidnapping, aggravated robbery); <em>State v.

In <em>State v. Ashworth </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 56, 706 N.E.2d 1231, paragraph one of the syllabus, we held that \u201cwhen a defendant wishes to waive the presentation of <em>all </em>mitigating evidence, a trial court must conduct an inquiry of the defendant on the record to determine whether the waiver is knowing and voluntary.\u201d (Emphasis <em>sic.) </em>We also held that a defendant must be competent to forgo the presentation of mitigating evidence. <em>Id., </em>paragraph two of the syllabus. I cannot concur in the refusal of the majority to apply these principles to the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-9\">We further recognized in <em>Ashworth </em>that a \u201ctrial court should be cognizant of actions on the part of the defendant that would call into question the defendant\u2019s competence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 62, 706 N.E.2d at 1237. In the penalty phase of a capital case, where the decision to be made is one of life and death, any indicium of incompetence should be explored to ensure that a defendant is capable of making a knowing and intelligent waiver of this critical right.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-10\">In the case at bar the trial court should have ordered a competency hearing and expressly determined whether Jesse Cowans knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to present mitigating evidence. Cf. <em>State v. Ashworth. </em>Because these critical procedural safeguards were not employed in this capital case, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b203-12\">Competency</p>\n<p id=\"b203-13\">A defendant is mentally competent to forgo the presentation of mitigating evidence in the penalty phase of a capital case if (1) he has the mental capacity to understand the choice between life and death, (2) he has the mental capacity to make a knowing and intelligent decision not to pursue the presentation of evidence, (3) he fully comprehends the ramifications of his decision, and (4) he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>possesses the ability to reason logically and to choose means that relate logically to his ends. See <em>Ashworth, </em>paragraph two of the syllabus; <em>State v. Berry </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 1504, 659 N.E.2d 796.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">The majority cites <em>State v. Tyler </em>(1990), 50 Ohio St.3d at 29, 553 N.E.2d at 585, for the proposition that waiver of mitigation, in and of itself, does not call into question a capital defendant\u2019s competence. I concurred in <em>Tyler, </em>and now conclude that all capital defendants who instruct their counsel to waive mitigation should be evaluated for competency. Furthermore, I believe Cowans should have been examined for competency under the precedent established in <em>Tyler </em>and <em>Ashworth. </em>That precedent, recognized by the majority, provides that a court must inquire into the competence of a capital defendant who decides to waive the right to present mitigation evidence, if some reason exists to question competence, other than the waiver decision itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">Cowans\u2019s circumstance is not one where the sole indicium of incompetence is that the capital defendant decided to waive mitigation. Rather, Cowans\u2019s behavior at trial, which the trial court acknowledged to be disruptive, combined with his apparently illogical choice to waive mitigation after having been found guilty, while never expressing a desire for imposition of the death penalty over life in prison, and all the while maintaining his innocence, should have alerted the trial court to the possibility that Cowans lacked competence to knowingly and voluntarily waive his right to present mitigation evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">In <em>Tyler, </em>the defendant indicated to the jury that he would prefer a death sentence to life imprisonment. Acknowledging and accepting his fate, despite his protestation of innocence, Tyler told the jury that \u201cto serve a life sentence \u2018for a murder that I didn\u2019t commit\u2019 would be as bad or worse than, death.\u201d <em>Tyler </em>at 27, 553 N.E.2d at 583. Tyler told the jury that whether or not they believed him to be guilty, \u201cif it [sic ] is any kindness in your heart at all, then you have got to still give me a death verdict, because life in the penitentiary is death.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b204-8\">The reasoned choice to waive mitigation made by Tyler is clearly distinguishable from the decision made by Cowans. Tyler fully realized that the presentation of mitigating evidence could potentially dissuade the jury from sentencing him to death. He chose not to present mitigating evidence precisely because he feared that the jury would consider the evidence and decide to sentence him to life in prison, a fate he considered worse than death.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-9\">In contrast, Cowans never indicated that he would prefer a death sentence to life in prison. Rather, Cowans had a fixed and unshakable belief that any further participation in the sentencing or mitigation process would be completely futile, as demonstrated repeatedly throughout the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-10\">During the reading of the verdict but before the jury left the courtroom, Cowans directed an outburst riddled with obscene language at the court and at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>the jury in which he repeatedly demanded to be removed from the courtroom. The court ordered that the defendant be taken into the court basement, to a room equipped with closed-circuit TV and sound, so that he could hear and see the remainder of the court proceedings. After the jurors completed reading the verdict forms and returned to the jury room, the court deputy approached the trial judge and reported under oath that Cowans had disabled the closed circuit TV set, including the sound, and was asking to be taken back to the jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">At the evidentiary hearing regarding the prior murder specification, Cowans again refused to be a part of the proceedings:</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">\u201cDefense Counsel: * * * He has indicated he no longer wishes to be present in the courtroom for any proceedings. He doesn\u2019t want to be present for the evidentiary hearing * * *[,] he does not want to be present for the mitigation hearing, nor does he want to be present for sentencing. His reasoning as expressed to me, on the mitigation phase, is that it is inherently biased because the jury that\u2019s already found him guilty of 20 counts, that would be biased against him when it came to any mitigation. And therefore, he doesn\u2019t choose to participate in that phase of it. And also, since he has stated he believes that the process by which the recommendation of the jury is obtained and given to the court is biased, that he does not wish to participate in the sentencing. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">\u00ab * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">\u201cThe Court: You do not wish to be present for this hearing?</p>\n<p id=\"b205-9\">\u201cThe Defendant: I don\u2019t want to be a part of none of this kangaroo * * *.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-10\">\u201cThe Court: All right. Sir, then at this point in time, we\u2019ll have him removed from the courtroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-11\"><em>U </em>* * <em>%</em></p>\n<p id=\"b205-12\">\u201cWe\u2019ll put him downstairs at this stage.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-13\">\u201cThe Defendant: No, no, no, don\u2019t man. What do I\u2014 * * * Man, what do I \u2014 I don\u2019t want to be a part of none of this s* * *, it\u2019s kangaroo.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-14\">\u201cThe Court: You have a right to hear what\u2019s going on, Mr. Cowans.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-15\">\u201cThe Defendant: I\u2019m cool; I\u2019m cool.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-16\">\u201cThe Court: Mr. Cowans, do you understand you have the right to a hearing?</p>\n<p id=\"b205-17\">\u201cThe Defendant: I don\u2019t want to be a part of none of your kangaroo court. I don\u2019t want to be nowhere in the courthouse.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-18\"><em>ti </em>r[* .\u00a1\u00ed iji</p>\n<p id=\"b205-19\">\u201cThe Court: All right. You have the right, sir, to participate in this hearing if you wish, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>\u201cThe Defendant: Yeah, kangaroo court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">The court then put Cowans back into the room with closed-circuit TV and audio hookup. A few minutes later, Cowans\u2019s counsel informed the court that Cowans was requesting that the sound on the audio be turned down. He was refusing to watch, had his back to the screen, and was struggling with three deputies while demanding to be returned to the jail immediately.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">As demonstrated above, Cowans exhibited behaviors and beliefs that should have put the trial court on notice that Cowans\u2019s thinking might be less than rational. Cowans\u2019s disruptive behavior could have been a misguided protest against the criminal justice proceedings against him, grounded in rational thought. However, his behavior could also have been the result of mental instability. His outbursts demonstrate a potential inability to control his behavior and reveal a feeling of futility that could be produced from a mental disorder affecting his competency to execute a valid waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">Moreover, the record demonstrates that Cowans repeatedly made comments consistent with the unreasonable belief, approaching paranoia, that everyone involved in the trial was working against him. In addition to the comments previously quoted, which demonstrate an extreme distrust of the jury, the judge, and the prosecutor, Cowans exhibited an inflexible belief from the very beginning of his case that even his assigned counsel believed that he was guilty and that he had no real chance of getting a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-8\">Prior to the jury voir dire, Cowans asked that his first set of counsel be dismissed because they discussed plea-bargain options with him, and he expressed a fear that anyone else from that counsel\u2019s office would be controlled by the originally appointed counsel. Cowans told the court that appointing other counsel from the same office would be \u201cjust like hanging me, Your Honor, you might as well hang me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b206-9\">He continued his protests against assigned counsel saying, \u201c[t]he reason I am coming at this, this man keeps pushing me to plea bargain. Now if you give me an attorney from his office, he will still be running the show behind the scenes. I think, you know, I beg the Court to at least think about that.\u201d Cowans\u2019s appointed counsel told that court that he hadn\u2019t even started to talk to Cowans about plea-bargain possibilities. Counsel stated, \u201cI hadn\u2019t even said the words plea bargain. * * * I am more than willing to work with Mr. Cowans. I don\u2019t know, he obviously felt that I was trying to pressure him, but I certainly wasn\u2019t and I am more than happy to have him reject the plea bargain and go forward at trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b206-10\">In an abundance of caution, the court decided to allow Cowans\u2019s motion to appoint new counsel, and Cowans proceeded to challenge the second set of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>counsel as well. Again, Cowans expressed a belief that counsel were working against him, trying to pressure him into pleading guilty to the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">\u201cThe Defendant: They want \u2014 they feel I am guilty, you know. I feel they can\u2019t represent me to best of their ability because they feel I am guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\"><em>U </em>sj: <em>%</em></p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">\u201cThe Defendant: It is not about liking them. They are wanting me to plead guilty and lie. * * *\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">Again, Cowans\u2019s counsel informed the court that Cowans\u2019s fears were unfounded. Counsel told the court that they had never advised Cowans that they thought he was guilty. \u201c[W]e did what all attorneys do with clients, discuss evidence and discuss theories * * * and we have had some differences on approaches. But we have not said those things, nor have we ever asked Mr. Cowans to tell an untruth under oath or any other wise [sic ].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b207-9\">When the court refused Cowans\u2019s second request to have counsel removed, Cowans appeared unable to accept the court\u2019s determination. He remained fixated on his belief that counsel was working against him and that his only hope was to have new counsel appointed. The court\u2019s attempts to move Cowans past that issue and onto other necessary matters was futile. Because Cowans was unresponsive with the court and would not give up the notion that he should have new counsel appointed, the trial court had him removed from the courtroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-10\">A week later, when Cowans was returned to the courtroom for further proceedings, he continued to exhibit a fixation on the idea that his own counsel believed him to be guilty and were working against him. During this communication with the court, Cowans also indicated a belief that the prosecuting attorney was out to get him, that someone was laughing at him, and that the court itself was biased against him. His inappropriate behaviors escalated:</p>\n<p id=\"b207-11\">\u201cThe Defendant: Your Honor, prosecution is going to say stuff like that. They would rather me keep counsel that ain\u2019t going to be able to represent me to their fullest, because that would be in their benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-12\">\u201cThe Court: Mr. Cowans, let me advise you, again, sir, that you have the right to sit here and participate in this trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-13\">\u201cThe Defendant: Participate how? Participate in hanging me?</p>\n<p id=\"b207-14\">\u201cThe Court: I just told you, Mr. Cowans.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-15\">\u201cThe Defendant: The man is going to laugh at me.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-16\">\u201cThe Court: Did I just tell you before, not too long ago\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b207-17\">\u201cThe Defendant: The man is going to laugh at me.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>\u201cThe Court: \u2014 you are leaving this Courtroom if you continue this?</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">\u201cThe Defendant: The man is going to laugh at me.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">\u201cThe Court: If he laughs, sir, so what? So what if he laughs at you?</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">\u201cThe Defendant: So, now, I see what it\u2019s really about.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">\u201cThe Court: At this point in time, sir, he shouldn\u2019t be laughing at you. But the point of the matter is, you are not to react this way.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-9\">\u201cThe Defendant: Why not? ' I\u2019m fighting for my life, man.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-10\">\u201cThe Court: You are going to leave this courtroom if you keep it up, Mr. Cowans.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-11\">\u201cThe Defendant: I want the Judge to tell me what I\u2019m supposed to do now to get new counsel. I want new counsel. I don\u2019t want this man as my counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-12\">\u201cThe Court: Mr. Cowans, at this point in time, I\u2019m indicating that this is the counsel that you are going to have to work with, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-13\">\u201cThe Defendant: So, what do we do now during trial? I don\u2019t want this man as my counsel. I don\u2019t want this man representing me in anything. Now, what?</p>\n<p id=\"b208-14\">\u201cThe Court: Do you wish to represent yourself, Mr. Cowans?</p>\n<p id=\"b208-15\">\u201cThe Defendant: How? I don\u2019t know s* * * about law. How?</p>\n<p id=\"b208-16\">\u201cThe Court: Then I suggest you cooperate.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-17\">\u201cThe Defendant: Cooperate with a man that\u2019s trying to down me? Come on, Your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-18\">\u201cThe Court: You have Mr. Wallace, also, Mr. Cowans.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-19\">\u201cThe Defendant: Yeah, okay. I see what this is about.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-20\">\u201cThe Court: Anything else?</p>\n<p id=\"b208-21\">\u201cThe Defendant: Yeah. I feel that you might as well be in their pocket. Are they paying you to down me or something? Is the prosecution paying you, Your Honor?</p>\n<p id=\"b208-22\">\u201cThe Court: Anything else?</p>\n<p id=\"b208-23\">\u201cThe Defendant: Must be.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-24\">\u201cThe Court: Do you have anything else you want to add about this motion, sir, before we leave?</p>\n<p id=\"b208-25\">\u201cThe Defendant: I would like new counsel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b208-26\">Additionally, Cowans expressed his distrust of the woman who would have controlled the stun belt, which Cowans had the option of wearing rather than appearing before the jury in shackles. Cowans told the court that he would not wear the belt if she was in control of it because he thought that she seemed to have a \u201cpersonal problem\u201d with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>The defendant\u2019s outbursts, fixations, and apparent feelings of persecution should have put the court on notice that there was a least a possibility that Cowans was incompetent to make a rational decision to waive mitigation. Expression of his beliefs could have been based on a rational attempt to control or manipulate the criminal proceedings. They could also have been based on a mental disorder creating paranoia.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">In order to avoid the very argument raised by defendant in this appeal, the trial court should have ordered a competency hearing to determine whether, in fact, the defendant was competent to waive this essential right. Because the record does not reveal that Cowans\u2019s decision to waive mitigation has a rational connection to any of his stated goals or choices, Cowans\u2019s competency to waive mitigation remains in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">The majority is satisfied with the trial court\u2019s evaluation that Cowans evidenced \u201cno mental instability but rather acted out his pique.\u201d My review of the record causes me to conclude that the conclusion of the trial court was not obvious from Cowans\u2019s conduct. Particularly where an accused may receive the penalty of death, trial courts should be most cautious in making their own conclusion regarding the competence of the defendant to make rational decisions regarding the trial of his or her own case.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">As has been demonstrated by an increasing number of cases in Ohio and nationwide, failing to conduct a timely competency hearing when a capital defendant desires to waive mitigation will likely lead only to more appeals, longer delays, and diminished confidence that the death penalty is being used only in truly appropriate cases. In addition to preserving the defendant\u2019s rights, the trial courts can promote judicial economy by avoiding foreseeable appeals, and can promote faith in the system, by making it a practice to order competency hearings whenever there is any indication that the defendant\u2019s competency to execute a knowing and voluntary waiver may be affected.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b209-10\">Knowing and Voluntary Waiver</p>\n<p id=\"b209-11\">I agree with the majority that the colloquy requirements adopted in <em>Ashworth </em>should be strictly followed and that substantial compliance should not be deemed sufficient. This court has long recognized the mandatory nature of such procedural safeguards, and, in recent years, we have vacated the death sentence in two cases when the trial court failed to strictly adhere to procedural requirements: <em>State v. Pless </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 333, 658 N.E.2d 766, paragraph one of the syllabus; and <em>State v. Green </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 100, 689 N.E.2d 556, syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>However, I also believe that these requirements should be applied not only prospectively but in all cases. The colloquy requirements outlined in <em>Ashworth </em>are procedural requirements this court deemed necessary to ensure that a waiver of mitigation has been made knowingly and intelligently.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">The trial court below made no determination on the record regarding Cowans\u2019s understanding and waiver of rights. Unlike the trial court in <em>Ashworth, </em>the trial court here failed to define \u201cmitigating evidence,\u201d and the record does not indicate that Cowans fully understood the importance of mitigating evidence and its use to offset aggravating circumstances. Rather, the record shows that Cowans repeatedly agreed to whatever the court asked, often without even waiting until the statement was complete. This does not demonstrate an understanding of the importance of mitigation or of waiving the right to present any mitigating evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">Further, the court did not fully outline the consequences of Cowans\u2019s decision to forgo the presentation of mitigating evidence. While the court did state that without mitigating evidence the jury would \u201cprobably\u201d come back with a death penalty verdict, this does not adequately represent the significance of the waiver. As reflected in the jury instructions given by the court, a death penalty verdict was not only \u201cprobable\u201d but required by law if aggravating circumstances existed and no mitigation was presented. See <em>Emerson v. Gramley </em>(C.A.7, 1996), 91 F.3d 898, 906.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">In <em>Ashworth, </em>there were several discussions between the trial court and the defendant regarding the mandatory nature of imposing the death penalty if no mitigation evidence was presented. Nothing in the record of this case, however, indicates that Cowans understood the compulsory nature of the jury instructions that would be presented in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">In order to fully understand the importance of mitigating evidence and its use to offset the aggravating circumstance(s), it is also necessary that the defendant understand the possible mitigation evidence available in his or her own case. <em>Id., </em>91 F.3d at 906. Defense counsel stated that they had discussed the issue with Cowans and that he had not arrived lightly at his decision; however, nothing in the record indicates that counsel fully explained the specific mitigating evidence available to Cowans. The court should have inquired both of Cowans, and of defense counsel, whether counsel had explained the specific mitigating evidence available and whether Cowans understood how that evidence might offset the aggravating circumstances of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-9\">Further, because of the specific concerns raised by this defendant on the record, the court should have explained that the jury, despite having found him guilty, was legally obligated to find that the death penalty was not appropriate if any mitigating evidence outweighed the aggravating circumstances. It may also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>have been helpful to specifically address that the state has the burden to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating factors and that juries cannot legally recommend the death penalty solely because they find a defendant guilty of the underlying charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">The court made no findings of fact as to Cowans\u2019s understanding and waiver of rights, and the record in this case does not demonstrate that Cowans did, in fact, knowingly and voluntarily waive his rights to mitigation. Therefore, regardless of whether the specific procedural guidelines set forth in <em>Ashworth </em>are applied to this case or applied only prospectively, the record in this case does not indicate that Cowans knowingly and voluntarily waived his mitigation rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">Based on the foregoing reasons, I would hold that Cowans\u2019s competency to waive mitigation was never established, and his former waiver is therefore void. In addition, even if Cowans had been deemed competent to waive mitigation, the record does not establish that Cowans\u2019s waiver was knowing and intelligent. Therefore, I would affirm his conviction, but would reverse the death sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
