For the following reasons, Wilson\u2019s assertions lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-17\">To the extent that Wilson requested that Judge Sunderland rule on his motion for a free transcript, his claim was rendered moot when Judge Sunderland subsequently denied the motion. Mandamus will not issue to compel an act that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>has already been performed. <em>State ex rel. Jones v. O\u2019Connor </em>(1999), 84 Ohio St.3d 426, 426, 704 N.E.2d 1223, 1224.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">In addition, although Wilson claimed he needed a copy of the transcript to help him prepare an appeal in the court of appeals, that appeal was no longer pending when the court of appeals denied the writ. <em>State ex rel. Call v. Zimmers </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 367, 368, 708 N.E.2d 711, 712; <em>State ex rel. Murr v. Thierry </em>(1987), 34 Ohio St.3d 45, 45, 517 N.E.2d 226, 226-227; see, also, <em>State ex rel. Newton v. Court of Claims </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 553, 557, 653 N.E.2d 366, 370, quoting <em>Oregon v. Dansack </em>(1993), 68 Ohio St.3d 1, 4, 623 N.E.2d 20, 22 (\u201cin mandamus actions \u2018a court is not limited to considering facts and circumstances at the time a proceeding is instituted, but should consider the facts and conditions at the time it determines to issue a peremptory writ\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">Finally, Wilson had an adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law to obtain the requested transcript, <em>ie., </em>a motion in the court of appeals in his appeal. <em>State ex rel. Jones v. Montgomery Cty. Court of Common Pleas </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 642, 643, 665 N.E.2d 673, 674.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">Based on the foregoing, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b663-9\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
