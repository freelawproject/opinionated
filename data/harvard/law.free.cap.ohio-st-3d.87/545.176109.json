In order to prevail completely in a <em>quo warranto </em>action, a relator must establish (1) .that the office is being unlawfully held and exercised by respondent and (2) that relator is entitled to the office. <em>State ex rel. Delph v. Barr </em>(1989), 44 Ohio St.3d 77, 541 N.E.2d 59, syllabus; <em>State ex rel. Brenders v. Hall </em>(1995), 71 Ohio St.3d 632, 633-634, 646 N.E.2d 822, 824.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-9\">Brown contends that she is lawfully holding the office because the mayor appointed her clerk-treasurer under R.C. 733.31(A), which provides that \u201c[i]n the event of a vacancy in the office of village clerk or treasurer, the mayor may appoint a person to serve as an acting officer to perform the duties of the office until a permanent officer is appointed to fill the vacancy.\u201d R.C. 733.68 specifies that \u201c[e]xcept as otherwise provided by the Revised Code <em>each officer of a municipal corporation, </em>or of any department or board thereof, <em>whether elected or appointed as a substitute for a regular officer, shall be an elector of the municipal corporation </em>* * *.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b660-10\">Although Brown concedes that she is neither an elector nor a resident of Alger, she claims that the mayor was authorized to appoint a non-elector as clerk-treasurer on a temporary basis. But contrary to Brown\u2019s claims, these statutes do not permit the village mayor to appoint a nonelector as clerk-treasurer when the appointment is temporary rather than permanent.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-11\">In interpreting a statute, we must first examine its express terms. <em>Freedom Rd. Found. v. Ohio Dept. of Liquor Control </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 202, 206, 685 N.E.2d 522, 525. It is the duty of the court to give effect to the words used and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>not to insert words not used. <em>State ex rel. Cuyahoga Cty. v. State Personnel Bd. of Review </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 496, 499, 696 N.E.2d 1054, 1056.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">R.C. 733.68 manifestly requires that an appointed or elected clerk-treasurer be an elector of the municipal corporation and does not differentiate between either a provisional or a permanent appointment. See, also, 1 Gotherman &amp; Babbit, Ohio Municipal Law (2 Ed.1992) 151, Section 9.06(B). Nothing in R.C. 733.31(A), which authorizes the appointment of acting officers, provides otherwise, and R.C. 733.261(B) also mandates that \u201c[t]he clerk-treasurer shall be an elector of the municipal corporation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">Therefore, Myers has established that Brown, a nonelector of the village, is unlawfully holding and exercising the office of clerk-treasurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">Brown nevertheless claims that we should deny the writ because Myers has not established the second general requirement for extraordinary relief in <em>quo warranto, i.e., </em>that he is entitled to the office. We agree with Brown that Myers has not established his entitlement to be appointed clerk-treasurer. Myers was not the only resident who applied for the office of clerk-treasurer, and Mayor Hensley did not have any duty to appoint Myers to that office.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-8\">But Myers\u2019s failure to establish his entitlement to be appointed clerk-treasurer does not preclude a writ of <em>quo warranto. </em>If a relator in a <em>quo ivarranto </em>proceeding fails to establish entitlement to the office, judgment may still be rendered on the issue of whether respondent lawfully holds the disputed office. <em>Delph, supra, </em>44 Ohio St.3d at 80, 541 N.E.2d at 62; <em>State ex rel. Ethell v. Hendricks </em>(1956), 165 Ohio St. 217, 226-227, 59 O.O. 298, 303-304, 135 N.E.2d 362, 368. Myers proved that Brown is not lawfully holding and exercising the office of clerk-treasurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-9\">Based on the foregoing, we grant Myers a writ of <em>quo warranto </em>solely to remove Brown from the office of Alger Clerk-Treasurer. We deny the writ insofar as Myers requests his appointment to that office.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-10\">\n<em>Writ granted in part and denied in part.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b661-11\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
