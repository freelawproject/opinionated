For the following reasons, Bruggeman\u2019s assertion is meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-14\">In order to prevail on a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in a child custody case, the petitioner must establish that (1) the child is being unlawfully detained, and (2) the petitioner has the superior legal right to custody of the child. <em>Holloway v. Clermont Cty. Dept. of Human Serv. </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 128, 130, 684 N.E.2d 1217, 1219.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-15\">Here, Bruggeman did not allege any superior legal right to custody of the child. Further, from his own petition, it is evident that an award of custody to Bruggeman, an incarcerated, convicted child abuser, would not be in the best interests of his child. <em>Id., </em>80 Ohio St.3d at 131, 684 N.E.2d at 1219-1220; see, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>also, <em>Pegan v. Crawmer </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 97, 102, 666 N.E.2d 1091, 1095-1096.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">In addition, Bruggeman did not name his former wife, who has custody of their child, as a respondent in his habeas corpus petition. See R.C. 2725.04(A) and (B).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">Based on the foregoing, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b372-8\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
