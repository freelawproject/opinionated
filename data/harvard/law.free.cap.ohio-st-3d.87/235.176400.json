See, <em>e.g., Miller v. Kutschbach </em>(1996), 111 Ohio App.3d 157, 159, 675 N.E.2d 1277, 1278 (\u201cAny argument that appellant is prejudiced because he cannot pay the court costs of $60.02 before refiling the contempt motion is moot because the record demonstrates that appellant has already paid these costs.\u201d). In addition, appellees did not exercise judicial or quasi-judicial authority in attempting to collect costs, and Recker had an adequate legal remedy by appealing the common pleas court\u2019s costs order.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b350-6\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E. Sweeney, Pfeifer, Cook and Lundberg Stratton, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b349-14\">. We deny appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss. Appellees claim that Recker\u2019s appeal is moot because Recker\u2019s sister paid his court costs. Recker\u2019s appeal, however, challenges the court of appeals\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>dismissal of his prohibition action based on mootness, <em>ie., </em>he contends that his sister\u2019s payment of court costs did not render his prohibition action moot. Consequently, we must address the merits of this claim. See, <em>e.g., Pewitt v. Lorain Correctional Inst. </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 470, 472, 597 N.E.2d 92, 93-94, where we considered the merits of an appellant\u2019s claim that the court of appeals improperly dismissed as moot his habeas corpus petition.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
