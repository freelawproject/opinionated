For the following reasons, Evans\u2019s assertion is meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-10\">Habeas corpus relief is the exception rather than the general rule in child custody actions, and the writ will ordinarily be denied if there is an adequate remedy in the ordinary course of the law. <em>Pegan v. Crawmer </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 97, 99, 666 N.E.2d 1091, 1094. Evans is not entitled to the writ because he has or had an adequate legal remedy by appealing the trial court\u2019s permanent allocation of parental rights in his divorce action. See, <em>e.g., </em>R.C. 3109.04(H), providing for an appeal from decisions granting or modifying a decree allocating parental rights and responsibilities for the care of children.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-11\">In addition, Evans was not entitled to habeas corpus relief because the petition he filed in the court of appeals did not comply with the pleading requirements of R.C. 2725.04, <em>i.e., </em>his petition was not verified. <em>Holloway v. Clermont Cty. Dept. of Human Serv. </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 128, 132, 684 N.E.2d 1217, 1220.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-12\">Further, even assuming, as Evans contends, that Klaeger\u2019s motion to dismiss was not timely filed, the court of appeals properly dismissed the matter based on the state\u2019s.motion. The court would also have been entitled to dismiss Evans\u2019s action <em>sua sponte </em>because it was obviously without merit. See <em>State ex rel. Thompson v. Spon </em>(1998), 83 Ohio St.3d 551, 553, 700 N.E.2d 1281, 1282.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>Finally, to the extent that Evans requested prohibitory injunctive relief, the court of appeals lacked jurisdiction to grant it. See <em>State ex rel. Forsyth v. Brigner </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 71, 72, 711 N.E.2d 684, 685.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">Based on the foregoing, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b376-7\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E. Sweeney, Pfeifer, Cook and Lundberg Stratton, JJ.,' concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b376-20\">. We also deny Evans\u2019s request for oral argument. Evans has not established that oral argument is necessary for the resolution of his appeal. <em>State ex rel. McGinty v. Cleveland City School Dist. Bd. of Edn. </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 283, 286, 690 N.E.2d 1273, 1276.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
