The examiner held that if the circular recesses were upraised instead of countersunk they would serve as friction elements, and would also serve a somewhat ornamental purpose; that whether countersunk or upraised in the handle of the tool the circular recesses were integral parts of the goods and served a mechanical and useful function; and that, therefore, the alleged trade-mark was not registrable.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-31\">The Commissioner of Patents, although being of opinion that the words \u201cVacuum Grip\u201d were not descriptive of the goods on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>which the mark was used, held that the circular recesses forming a substantial portion of the mark served a utilitarian purpose and that, therefore, the mark was not registrable.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\">It may be said at this point that the reason given by the Commissioner of Patents for holding that the words \u201cVacuum Grip\u201d were not descriptive of the goods on which they were used was that as appellant was the owner of trade-mark registration No. 141,355, issued April 19, 1921, on an application filed June 8, 1920, for the trade-mark \u25a0\u201cVacuum Grip\u201d for use on cutlery, machinery, and tools and parts thereof, it was '\u201centitled to the benefit of any reasonable doubt as to the registrability of the same \u2022or a closely similar mark upon a subsequent .application to register.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">In holding that appellant\u2019s mark was not registrable, the commissioner referred to \"his decision in companion appeal No. 4461, wherein he stated, inter alia:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-6\">\u201cIt is my opinion that registration was properly refused on the ground that the alleged trade-mark is an integral part of the .goods to which it is applied, and is of mechanical utility in connection therewith. It is a matter of common knowledge that the handles of most pliers are roughened to prevent slipping in the hand of the user, <em>and, it is admitted by applicant\u2019s counsel that, \u2018to a negligible </em>extent/ <em>the embossed circles on applicant\u2019s plier handles serve that purpose. </em>This admission of counsel is predicated upon a statement occurring in the affidavit of applicant\u2019s president <em>\u2018that this particular symbol serves no utilitarian purpose beyond that of any other roughened surface found on hand tools to preclude slipping of the palms thereover \u25a0during the grasp thereof.\u2019 \u201d </em>(Italics not quoted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">The affidavit referred to in the \u2022quoted excerpt from the commissioner\u2019s \u25a0decision in appeal No. 4461 is not in the record, and there is no explanation of why it is not. Accordingly, the quotation from the affidavit of the president of the appellant company appearing in the commissioner\u2019s decision must be regarded by us as ac\u2022curate. In re Kluter, 92 F.2d 906, 25 C.C.P.A., Patents, 730, 732.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">The record contains the affidavits of one H. G. Kell, vice president of the appellant company, dated February 24, 1939, and .April 24, 1940, respectively. In the affidavit dated February 24, 1939, it is stated in substance that the circular recesses forming a part of the alleged trade-mark here involved are technically referred to as \u201cvacuum cups\u201d; that such recesses when countersunk could not possibly impart a suction effect; that when countersunk such recesses present fanciful appearance and neither describe nor misdescribe either the hand tool or the handle thereof on which they are used; that appellant has expended more than $100,000 in popularizing its alleged trade-mark; and that the public has learned to understand that appellant\u2019s alleged trade-mark indicates origin of appellant\u2019s goods in appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-10\">In his affidavit dated April 24, 1940, Mr. Kell stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-11\">\u201c * * * That it has been found from a production standpoint more desirable to impress the Vacuum Grip Symbol by resort to countersunk rather than upraised recesses in the handle grasping surfaces of a tool; that this renders it more adaptable to production methods and gives greater life to the impressing die; that instances of tools whereon the Vacuum Grip Symbol is impressed by resort to countersunk recesses are shown in the circular accompanying the amendment filed on to wit April 8, 1940; * * * that the aforesaid countersunk recesses defining the \u2018Vacuum Grip\u2019 symbol as illustrated in applicant\u2019s trade circular present a smooth surface to the feel of the palm when grasped for manipulation of the respective tools; that these symbols present no roughened surfaces to the feel of the hand during the manual grasping operation and that the aforesaid \u2018Vacuum Grip\u2019 symbol [the circular recesses] on the aforesaid tools does not aid in the gripping of the tools, but is still as important as ever in designating origin of the tools in and to the applicant, Forged Steel Products Company.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-12\">\u201cAffiant further avers and states the fact to be that Earl W. Myers who originally subscribed to and executed an affidavit of record in this case, is now deceased; <em>that the affidavit of said Earl W. Myers has reference only to Vacuum Grip Symbols of the upraised type illustrated in the aforesaid circular-, </em>that the \u2018Vacuum Grip\u2019 Symbol of the upraised type is gradually being dispensed with and will only be utilized until the present impression dies therefor become too worn for further use; that thereafter the upraised \u2018Vacuum Grip\u2019 Symbol on such few remaining illustrations now contained in the aforesaid circular, will be substituted by the \u2018Vacuum Grip\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>Symbol of the countersunk recessed type; * * * that when new dies are made to displace the upraised \u2018Vacuum Grip\u2019 Symbol, all of these tools will present the same symbol as identified for the countersunk recess type in the aforesaid illustrations; <em>that none of the cVacuum Grip\u2019 Symbols will then present any roughened surfaces to the feel of the palm; and that any roughened surface in the upraised \u2018Vacuumi Grip\u2019 Symbol is merely incidental rather than a necessary or desired feature thereof and is entirely eliminated in the countersunk recess type symbol; and that the cVacuum Grip\u2019 symbol is utilized merely to designate origin of the aforesaid tools in and to applicant as set forth in affiant\u2019s previous affidavit.\u201d </em>(Italics not quoted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">On page 20 of appellant\u2019s circular, referred to in the affidavit, of Mr. Kell, under the heading \u201cFacts You Should Know About Pliers,\u201d reference being had to appellant\u2019s vacuum grip pliers, it is stated, among other things, that the handles of appellant\u2019s tools are comfortably formed and that the \u201cfamous \u2018Vacuum Grip\u2019 * * * gives you a sure hold.\u201d On page 21 of the circular, with reference to pliers No. 137, it is stated: \u201cFashioned handles for greater comfort to the hand, with deeply bossed \u2018Vacuum Grip\u2019 cups, affording a sure, nonslip hold.\u201d On page 23 of the circular, with reference to pliers No. 196, it is stated: \u201cFull curved handles for hand comfort, with deeply recessed Vacuum Grip \u2018cups\u2019 for a sure grip.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">It is apparent from the affidavits of Mr. Kell and Mr. Myers (former president of the appellant company) and from appellant\u2019s circular (which was made a part of the record) that when the circular recesses are upraised the handles of the pliers have a roughened surface which prevents slipping in the hand of the user.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">It is true that affiant Kell stated that it is the purpose of appellant to discontinue the use of the upraised circular recesses in the alleged trade-mark. It is sufficient to say in this connection that the application here involved expressly includes upraised circular recesses. It is clear, therefore, from the record that the circular recesses in appellant\u2019s alleged trademark are a part of appellant\u2019s pliers and have a utilitarian function. The alleged trade-mark is, therefore, not registrable. <em>In </em>re Dennison Manufacturing Company, 39 F.2d 720, 17 C.C.P.A., Patents, 987; In re Vertex Hosiery Mills, Inc., 45 F.2d 249, 18 C.C.P.A., Patents, 725; In re National Stone-Tile Corporation, 57 F.2d 382, 19 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1101; Sparklets Corporation v. Walter Kidde Sales Co., 104 F.2d 396, 26 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1342.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">The decision of the Commissioner of Patents is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-10\">Appeal No. 4461.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-11\">Serial No. 380,630.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-12\">The alleged trade-mark involved in this appeal is the same as that involved in companion appeal No. 4460, except that it does not contain the words \u201cVacuum Grip.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b550-13\">The mark consists, as stated in appellant\u2019s application, \u201cof a symbol defined by three rows of circular recesses which may be <em>upraised or countersunk </em>relative to the handle grasping surface of the tool to which it is applied as shown in the drawing.\u201d (Italics ours.) It is further stated in appellant\u2019s application that appellant has used its alleged trade-mark on pliers since June 1, 1920.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-14\">The Commissioner of Patents held that the symbol, consisting of three rows of circular recesses, forming appellant\u2019s alleged trade-mark was a part of the tools to which it was applied; that it served a utilitarian function; and that therefore, it was not registrable as a trade-mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-15\">In our decision in companion appeal No. 4460, we quoted from the decision of the commissioner in the instant appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-16\">We are of opinion, for the reasons stated in our decision in appeal No. 4460, that the Commissioner of Patents reached the right conclusion. Accordingly, his decision is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-17\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
