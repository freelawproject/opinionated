We quote from the examiner\u2019s statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-25\">\u201cThe invention relates to a counting mechanism adapted to register both the quantity and cost of gasoline which is dispensed from a filling station pump. Such pumps, sometimes referred to as computing pumps usually comprise an underground source of liquid supply, a motor, a pump, a meter for measuring the liquid delivered, a register driven by the -meter to indicate quantity delivered, and a second register driven from the meter through a variator to indicate the cost of liquid delivered. The variator may consist of a change gear mechanism which is capable of being set to drive the cost register at varying speeds, and the settings are made and changed to correspond to the current price per unit volume. It is usual in this type of registering device, as is the case in this application, to provide the register head with two oppositely disposed faces, each of which displays the same indications, that is, the gallons delivered and the cost thereof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>\u201cDevices such as these, of course, must be capable of being readily reset to zero, so that upon starting a delivery, both the quantity and cost registers show \u2018zero,\u2019 in order that the true cost and quantity will be displayed at the end of any particular dispensing operation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-5\">\u201cIt is a particular object of this invention to improve the resetting mechanism. In this device, the resetting is accomplished by turning the wheels forwardly, or in the same direction that they rotate during a dispensing operation, and this type of zeroizing action makes possible two undesirable results; first, that the wheels may be moved too far, that is, beyond their zero position; and second, that, due to the forward turning of the wheels, they may drag forward the gearing which connects them to their primary driving source, and hence, when a new registering operation is started, following the zeroizing operation, due to the backlash which has been introduced into the gearing, some idle movement of the registering train ensues before the backlash is taken up. During this idle movement, the registering train, at the beginning of a dispensing operation, following a resetting, although liquid is being dispensed, it is not being registered and, hence, the filling station proprietor is losing due to inaccurate registration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-6\">\u201cTo avoid these two objectionable features, the device of this application provides an over-throw-preventing mechanism which stops the wheels when they reach zero, and a backlash eliminating mechanism, which puts a brake onto the driving element of a clutch in the driving train and thus holds the gearing in a position in which it was at the end of one dispensing operation, keeps it from moving during the zeroizing operation so that at the beginning of a subsequent dispensing operation, it is ready immediately to drive the register without any objectionable lag due to backlash.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">It will be observed from the quoted excerpt from the examiner\u2019s statement that, unless a device of the character of that here involved is capable of being readily and positively reset at zero \u201cso that upon starting a delivery, both the quantity and cost registers show \u2018zero,\u2019 \u201d the \u201cquantity and cost\u201d of gasoline will not be registered accurately.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">It further appears from the quoted excerpt from the examiner\u2019s statement that appellant has provided a counting mechanism in which, by means of an \u201coverthrow-preventing mechanism,\u201d the counter wheels are positively stopped \u201cwhen they reach zero,\u201d and that, in addition thereto, he has also provided a \u201cbacklash eliminating mechanism, which puts a brake onto the driving element of a clutch in the driving train and thus holds the gearing in a position in which it was at the end of one dispensing operation, keeps it from moving during the zeroizing operation so that at the beginning of a subsequent dispensing operation, it is ready immediately to drive the register without any objectionable lag due to backlash.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b569-10\">In rejecting the appealed claims on the patent to Chase, the Primary Examiner stated that the patentee disclosed a detent which at the end of one revolution of the \u201czeroizing shaft\u201d enters a notch and, as the examiner stated, <em>\u201coffers </em>resistance to the turning of the shaft.\u201d (Italics ours.) The examiner further stated that the \u201czeroizing shaft\u201d was then turned reversely, although it might be \u201cturned further [forwardly] after the detent engages the notch, the structure in the patent which offers resistance to turning, together with the structure for effecting reverse turning, <em>effects the same result as is effected by the mechanism of claim 66, </em>and is believed to fairly meet the requirements of this claim, <em>for to modify the structure of Chase in order to make the offering of resistance positive </em>[that is, in order to positively stop the counter wheels at zero] is believed a change involving mechanical skill, and not invention.\u201d (Italics ours.)</p>\n<p id=\"b569-11\">In affirming the decision of the Primary Examiner, the Board of Appeals said: \u201cAs to claim 66, the sole question is whether it required invention to provide a stop means for stopping the wheels in reset position. We believe that, <em>when it was found that through intent or carelessness the wheels did not always stop at zero in the Chase device, the addition of a stop means was an obvious expedient and devoid of </em>invention(Italics ours.)</p>\n<p id=\"b569-12\">It will be observed that the tribunals of the Patent Office recognized that the structure defined in the patent to Chase does not include resetting mechanism which will positively reset the wheels at zero. The Primary Examiner stated that it would be obvious to modify the structure disclosed in the patent to Chase in order to accomplish the results obtained by appellant, and which were obviously not obtained by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>Chase structure. No suggestion is made in either of the decisions below, however, as to how that modification might be accomplished.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">The mechanism here involved is somewhat intricate, and the solution of the problem confronting appellant (which was of considerable importance to dispensers of gasoline and to the purchasing public) was not simple.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">There is nothing in the patent to Chase, nor is there anything else of record, except appellant\u2019s disclosure, to suggest how the defect, conceded to be present in the Chase structure, could be remedied. Accordingly, we are unable to agree with the views expressed by the tribunals of the Patent Office that the structure defined by the appealed claim would be obvious to one skilled in the art.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">For the reasons stated, the decision of the Board of Appeals is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
