Culley, and brought to him by Culley; think that Musson was with Culley, and also Mr. Cochran; they were at my office at one time about the purchase; think this was the time, but am not positive; it may have been before this; I told them they must give me the last enrollment before they could get the bill of sale recorded and a new enrollment issued ; this paper (bill of sale) was left with me by the parties with the request that I write to Memphis for a copy of enrollment; I did so; got a copy of the enrollment and inserted it; I do not recollect whether the paper, when left with me, was signed or not; do not recollect whether I delivered it to Culley, or sent it to Cochran or Mr. Edson at. Cairo; I think it was signed, however, for the enrollment seems; to have been written after the stamps were affixed; it was as near as I can say, from my book, about the first or middle of August; I cannot say positively why the conveyance was made to Culley; I think there was some understanding to that effect between the parties, but my recollection is not clear as to this matter; I recollect that I was compelled to write two or three times to Memphis, and that the boat made several trips in charge of Culley, and had some trouble with the custom house, and, as agent for Gaff, Cochran &amp; Co., here, I assisted in arranging temporary permits..</summary><summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b515-12\" pgmap=\"515(10) 516(86)\">For the plaintiffs,. Edson testified,, that he knew the parties that he wrote the note and contract (set out in plea) or bill of sale of the boat to Musson &amp; Gulley; that the boat was delivered to Gulley; thinks that Musson was in Chicago; never heard any thing of the abandonment of contract in relation to sale by plaintiffs; and (on cross-examination) was not present when the boat was delivered ; saw Gulley\u2019s hands on the boat afterward; does not know why the bill of sale afterward was made to Gulley at St. Louis.</summary><summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b516-5\" pgmap=\"516\">Green, witness for plaintiffs, testified, that he first talked with Musson &amp; Gulley, a few days before the execution of the contract above, in regard to selling them the boat, and that afterward the trade was closed with Gulley, and the contract drawn up and signed by all the parties. He further testified, that he delivered the boat to Musson &amp; Gulley about the date of the contract and before the delivery of the notes.</summary><summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b516-6\" pgmap=\"516\">The court gave the following instructions for the plaintiffs, to which defendant excepted:</summary><summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b516-7\" pgmap=\"516\">\u201c If the title to the boat in question passed by sale and delivery from plaintiffs to Musson &amp; Gulley, on the 23d day of June, 1865, if you find from the evidence such sale and delivery was made, and the contract by which the same passed was never abandoned or rescinded, the plaintiffs are entitled to recover in this suit if the material allegations in the declaration have been supported by the evidence.\u201d</summary><summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b516-8\" pgmap=\"516\">\u201c The court instructs the jury, that, under the issues in this case, it devolves upon the defendant to show by evidence an abandonment of the contract for the sale of the steamboat \u2018 Ella \u2019 to J.

Gulley, one of the purchasers, yet that fact does not relieve the defendant from proving an abandonment by plaintiffs of the contract for '\u25a0the sale of said boat. If the jury believe, from the evidence, that James W. Musson and R. 0. Gulley bought the steamboat \u201cElla \u2019 from plaintiffs, and the said boat was delivered to them, or one of them, for both, and that said sale or contract was never abandoned by plaintiffs, and that the other material averments in the declaration have been proved or admitted by the pleadings, the verdict should be for the plaintiffs.\u201d</summary><summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b517-6\" pgmap=\"517\">The court, at the instance of defendant, gave the following instructions:</summary><summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b517-7\" pgmap=\"517\">\u201c The court instructs the jury, that any material facts in defendant\u2019s plea, which are not denied by the plaintiffs\u2019 replication, are to be admitted.\u201d</summary><summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b517-8\" pgmap=\"517\">\u201c That the issue in this cause is, whether the plaintiffs abandoned the first contract set out in the second and third pleas of defendant; and, if you believe, from all the evidence in this cause, that the plaintiffs did abandon the said first agreement and sell the boat\u00a3 Ella \u2019 to Rodney 0.

The second plea (same as the third, printed at length) avers, that plaintiffs abandoned their contract to sell to the firm of \u201c Musson &amp; Gulley,\u201d and sold and conveyed the boat without the knowledge or consent of Byington, the defendant, guarantor, to Rodney 0. Gulley, individually. The replication takes issue on no other part of that plea than to traverse the abandonment of the contract to sell to the firm; and the only question on the record is, whether the defendant proved that part of his pleas; for every other allegation in the pleas, not denied or traversed by the replication, is, by the rules of pleading, admitted to be true. Dana v. Bryant, 1 Gilm. 104.</p><p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b518-9\" pgmap=\"518\">II. The original contract for the sale, by the plaintiffs, was to \u201cMusson &amp; Gulley\u201d both, and for \u201cMusson &amp; Gulley\u201d jointly Byington guaranteed, and the note was delivered to the plaintiffs; but they sold by a new and different contract afterward to Gulley alone, and applied the note to pay for his individual debt and purchase without the consent of Byington; therefore he is released.</p><p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b518-10\" pgmap=\"518\">When a note is indorsed for a special purpose, and the object of making the indorsement fails, the guaranty is at an end.

The writing, i. e. the first contract set out in the pleas, counsel hold to be a bill of sale, never was intended as such, and is not upon its face a bill of sale:</p><p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b519-7\" pgmap=\"519\">1.

The bill of sale really made is that set out in the abstract, and, although it purports to bear date of the 23d of June, 1865, was made in October of that year. We think it is palpably manifest that it is not the sale of the boat to the firm of \u201c Husson &amp; Gulley,\u201d and not the execution of the contract, for which the. note was given and guaranteed, which was for a sale to that firm. Whether the abandonment of the contract to sell to the firm was or was not by consent or agreement of the other parties, or did or did not injure Byington, the defendant, we think it is not for us to prove. The change of the contract without his consent, on which he guaranteed the note, released him. 1 Parsons on Cont. 504, note G; Mayhew v. Boyd, 5 Md.

The court ought to have given the instructions severally on the part of the defendant, which were refused, and ought to have refused the plaintiffs\u2019 instructions, because in form they are calculated to mislead the jury, especially so the concluding part of the second instruction, as it implied doubt as to whether the defendant relied on the only issues made up in the first and second pleas.</p><attorneys data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b520-6\" pgmap=\"520\">Messrs.

It would seem almost too clear for argument, that, by the terms of the writing set out in plaintiffs\u2019 third plea, defendants in error sold the steamboat \u201cElla\u201d to J. W. Musson and It. 0. Culley. The language of that writing furnishes no excuse for discussing the question as to its being an executed or an executory contract. In addition to the clear legal import of the writing, the evidence of Green shows that he, as agent of defendants in error, about the date of said writing, delivered the boat to Musson &amp; Culley, and that this delivery was before the notes, which expressed the consideration of the sale, were delivered to defendants in error.</p><p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b520-8\" pgmap=\"520(159) 521(63)\">II. Plaintiff in error seems to complain, that, after the sale and delivery of the boat to Musson &amp; Culley, a bill of sale, under the act of congress, was made to Culley alone; in other words, that before the boat was ready for enrollment under Musson &amp; Gulley\u2019s purchase, Musson had parted with his interest in the boat to Culley, in whose name alone the bill of sale was made and the boat enrolled ; the position assumed, in substance, being that to render plaintiff in error liable on his guaranty, Musson must never part with his interest in the boat. Such a proposition we are not disposed to argue. The guaranty of plaintiff in error was not a continuing one, but simply an undertaking that if Musson &amp; Culley did not pay the note guaranteed, he (Byington) would pay the same himself. It is respectfully submitted that all the authorities referred to by counsel for plaintiff in error upon this point are wholly inapplicable, and would only have the least pertinency if this suit had been brought upon a continuing guaranty. But the plaintiff in error, according to his own statements, testified to by Mr. Webb, guaranteed the note because Gulley \u201ctold him he would indemnify him against loss by a mortgage on two lots.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b521-6\" pgmap=\"521\">III. Although a bill of sale, under the act of congress, must be made to the purchaser upon the sale of a vessel in order to enrollment, yet, a boat being but a chattel, title to the same may pass to the purchaser without such bill of sale. A bill of sale was, however, regularly made out, according to the act of congress, by defendants in error to Gulley, and delivered to him. The evidence of Lightner shows, that there was some arrangement between Musson &amp; Gulley by which, the bill of sale was made to the latter, and that this was some days after Musson &amp; Gulley had taken possession of the boat, and even after they had repaired the boat at St. Louis.</p><p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b521-7\" pgmap=\"521\">IV\". The instructions given by the court embody the law, and the court might well have refused to instruct the jury at all, at the instance of plaintiff in error, upon the issue of an abandoment of the contract, for no evidence whatever, looking to an abandonment of the contract for the sale, by defendants in error, of the boat, was introduced by the plaintiff in error in the court below.</p> <opinion data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b521-8\" pgmap=\"521\">Mr. Justice Walker</author> <p id=\"AmS\" pgmap=\"521\">delivered the opinion of the Court:</p> <p id=\"b521-9\" pgmap=\"521\">Plaintiff in error insists that the judgment of the court below should be reversed, because of the refusal to give two instructions asked by him. We can see no error in refusing to give them. As asked, they were calculated to mislead the jury. The evidence shows, that the boat was sold to Musson &amp; Gulley, and under that sale was delivered alone to Gulley ; and it would seem that the delivery was in pursuance to, and fulfillment of, the contract of purchase; and the evidence tends to show that the transfer by the deed was made in the same manner, and to fulfill the agreement.</p> <p id=\"b522-5\" pgmap=\"522\">If it was transferred to him for both Musson &amp; Culley, with their assent, and in accordance with their wishes, then there can be no doubt that the agreement was substantially and legally performed, while these instructions would require the jury to find for defendant, unless the transfer had been made to both of them. *</p> <p id=\"b522-6\" pgmap=\"522\">Plaintiff in error had assumed the burden of proving that the original agreement had been abandoned, and a new sale made alone to Culley; and these instructions assume that the transfer of the boat to Culley, no difference how made, proved that fact; while, on the contrary, we have seen that the possession was delivered to Culley under the sale to Husson &amp; Culley, and the jury were warranted in finding that the transfer was made to Culley in the same manner; unless they had been properly modified, the court did right in refusing to give them to the jury. Perceiving no error in this record, the judgment of the court below must be affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b522-7\" pgmap=\"522\">Judgment affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
