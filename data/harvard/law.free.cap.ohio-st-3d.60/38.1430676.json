Burley, </em>v. <em>Coil Packing, Inc. </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St. 3d 18, 31 OBR 70, 508 N.E. 2d 936. For the reasons to follow, we find \u201csome evidence\u201d supporting that decision and reverse the appellate court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-15\">Dresser directs its sole challenge at Lyons\u2019 report. Dresser contends that Lyons attributes claimant\u2019s inability to work to the nonallowed psychiatric condition of \u201cdepression with hypochondriacal features,\u201d and that Lyons characterizes the condition as temporary. Even if this description of the Lyons report is accurate, however, Dresser ignores the commission\u2019s additional reliance on Dr. Retter\u2019s reports which state that the allowed back condition <em>alone </em>prevents sustained remunerative employment. Contrary to Dresser\u2019s suggestion, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>claimant who has multiple allowed conditions is not required to show that each condition, standing alone, is work-prohibitive. Here, regardless of claimant\u2019s mental status, he is physically unable to work. An unimpaired psychological state will not lessen or improve that physical incapacity. Dresser\u2019s challenge is thus unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">The claimant asks this court to henceforth require the commission to specifically identify the nonmedical disability factors relied on in granting or denying benefits. We have recently discussed this subject in <em>State, ex rel. Hartung, </em>v. <em>Columbus </em>(1990), 53 Ohio St. 3d 257, 560 N.E. 2d 196, <em>and State, ex rel. Noll, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1991), 57 Ohio St. 3d 203, 567 N.E. 2d 245. The facts of this case, however, foreclose the need for further consideration of the nonmedical disability factors identified in <em>State, ex rel. Stephenson, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St. 3d 167, 31 OBR 369, 509 N.E. 2d 946. While permanent total disability benefits may never be denied solely on the basis of medical evidence without consideration of <em>Stephenson </em>factors contained in the record, there are some situations where an <em>award </em>of such benefits may properly be based on medical factors alone. It would serve no practical purpose for the commission to consider nonmedical factors in extreme situations where medical factors alone preclude sustained remunerative employment, since nonmedical factors will not render the claimant any more or less physically able to work. Dr. Retter\u2019s reports found a total physical inability to work and concluded that rehabilitation was not indicated. This constitutes \u201csome evidence\u201d supporting an award of compensation for permanent total disability. We thus find a remand for additional consideration or explanation to be unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">Accordingly, the writ is denied and the judgment of the court of appeals is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b82-8\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Holmes, Douglas, Wright, H. Brown and Resnick, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
