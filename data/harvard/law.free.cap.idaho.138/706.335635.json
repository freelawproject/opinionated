The magistrate\u2019s decision was upheld on an intermediate appeal to the district court and, upon an alternative analysis, the district court further ruled that the statute in question was unconstitutional also on grounds of over-breadth. By cross-appeal, the respondent, David Korsen, contends that the district court erred in concluding that Korsen was not protected under double jeopardy principles against a retrial in the event of a remand resulting from the appellate process.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">This Court holds that the statute does not violate the Constitution as found by the courts below, either on grounds of vagueness or overbreadth. This Court also concludes that double jeopardy does not prohibit retrial of the trespass charge against Korsen.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b768-8\">David Korsen appeared at the office of the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare in Boise to discuss his child support obligations. He informed personnel at the office that he might get loud and that he was not going to leave until he obtained some relief regarding his support requirements. He learned from the social worker that only the court could grant the relief he was seeking through making adjustments to child support payments he owed. The discussion grew louder and louder and, although Korsen did not use profanities or make any threats, he refused to leave the offices. The police were called, and Korsen was arrested at the scene on a charge of trespass under I.C. \u00a7 18-7008(8), because he refused to leave after being asked by the regional director of the department, who was in charge of the offices, to vacate the premises.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b768-13\">The case was set for trial. At the close of the state\u2019s evidence, the magistrate dismissed the trespass charge. The magistrate concluded that the statute violated the Constitution because it was void for vagueness as applied to public property and because the statute failed to properly inform a person on public property about the specific conduct prohibited by the statute. The magistrate alternatively granted Korsen\u2019s motion for acquittal under Idaho Criminal Rule 29, concluding that insufficient evidence had been presented to support a verdict of guilty on the trespass charge. Specifically, the magistrate ruled that the state failed to prove that Korsen did or said anything to justify the director\u2019s request that Korsen leave the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-14\">The State appealed to the district court. The district court affirmed the magistrate\u2019s dismissal but not solely on the basis that the statute was defective by its failure to inform citizens of the conduct prohibited. The district court determined that the statute also contained no guidelines for enforcement and gave unbridled discretion to law enforcement in its application. Consequently, the district court held that the statute was void for vagueness as applied to public property. As an alternative ground, the district court found that the statute constituted a power of censorship and prior restraint of First Amendment activities and impermissibly allows individuals to be ordered off public premises merely because they express opinions of which those in charge of the property disapprove. The district court therefore held the statute to be overbroad insofar as it applies to public property.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-15\">The State appeals from the district court\u2019s determination. The State seeks a reversal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>both of the magistrate\u2019s decision and of the district court\u2019s decision, and argues for a remand for new trial on the trespass charge. Korsen has cross-appealed, arguing that remand is prohibited by the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-4\">ISSUES ON APPEAL</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">1. Is I.C. \u00a7 18-7008(8) valid and not facially void for vagueness, because it is not impermissibly vague in all its applications and because there is a core of circumstances to which the statute can unquestionably be constitutionally applied?</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">2. Is I.C. \u00a7 18-7008(8) valid and not facially overbroad, because it does not regulate a substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct?</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">3. Did the magistrate err by granting Korsen\u2019s Rule 29 motion for acquittal based upon the State\u2019s failure to prove a legitimate reason for asking Korsen to leave the premises, when the statute has no such requirement as one of its elements?</p>\n<p id=\"b769-8\">4. Is Korsen protected by double jeopardy principles from a retrial on the trespass charge?</p>\n<p id=\"b769-9\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b769-10\">Where the issues presented involve the constitutionality of a statute, we review the magistrate\u2019s determination <em>de novo. State v. Cobb, </em>132 Idaho 195, 969 P.2d 244 (1998); <em>Sun Valley Co. v. City of Sun Valley, </em>109 Idaho 424, 428, 708 P.2d 147, 151 (1985). The party challenging a statute on constitutional grounds bears the burden of establishing that the statute is unconstitutional and \u201cmust overcome a strong presumption of validity.\u201d <em>Olsen v. J.A Freeman Co., </em>117 Idaho 706, 709, 791 P.2d 1285, 1288 (1990). Appellate courts are obligated to seek an interpretation of a statute that upholds its constitutionality. <em>State v. Newman, </em>108 Idaho 5, 13, n. 12, 696 P.2d 856, 864 n. 12 (1985). Whether a defendant\u2019s prosecution complies with the constitutional protection against being placed twice in jeopardy is a question of law subject to free review. <em>State v. Santana, </em>135 Idaho 58, 63, 14 P.3d 378, 383 (Ct.App.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-11\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b769-12\">Idaho Code, Section 18-7008(8) makes criminal the continued presence of an individual on property that belongs to another after being notified to depart from the property by the owner or agent. The statute exempts only persons in a landlord-tenant relationship and applies to both private and public property.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-13\">1. <em>Void for Vagueness</em></p>\n<p id=\"b769-14\">The magistrate determined that I.C. \u00a7 18-7008(8), which draws no distinction between public and private property, implicates First Amendment rights of assembly and free speech. The magistrate found that the statute does not properly inform a person about what conduct gives a governmental agent legal cause to demand a person leave public facilities at the risk of criminal prosecution and that criminal liability may attach even if the person is on public property for a \u201clawful public purpose.\u201d The magistrate dismissed the case, holding the statute unconstitutionally vague as applied to public property.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-15\">The void-for-vagueness doctrine is premised upon the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. This doctrine requires that a statute defining criminal conduct be worded with sufficient clarity and definiteness that ordinary people can understand what conduct is prohibited and that the statute be worded in a manner that does not allow arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. <em>Village of Hoffman Estates v. Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc., </em>455 U.S. 489, 102 S.Ct. 1186, 71 L.Ed.2d 362 (1982). It is a basic principle of due process that an enactment is void for vagueness if its prohibitions are not clearly defined. Gra<em>yned v. City of Rockford, </em>408 U.S. 104, 92 S.Ct. 2294, 33 L.Ed.2d 222 (1972). Furthermore, as a matter of due process, no one may be required at the peril of loss of liberty to speculate as to the meaning of penal statutes. <em>United States v. Smith, </em>795 F.2d 841, 847 n. 4 (9th Cir.1986), <em>citing Lanzetta v. New Jersey, </em>306 U.S. 451, 453, 59 S.Ct. 618, 619, 83 L.Ed. 888, 890 (1939), <em>Smith v. United States, cert. denied, </em>481 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>1032, 107 S.Ct. 1964, 95 L.Ed.2d 535 (1987). This Court has held that due process requires that all \u201cbe informed as to what the State commands or forbids\u201d and that \u201cmen of common intelligence\u201d not be forced to guess at the meaning of the criminal law. <em>State v. Cobb, </em>132 Idaho 195, 969 P.2d 244 (1998), <em>citing Smith v. Goguen, </em>415 U.S. 566, 574, 94 S.Ct. 1242, 1248, 39 L.Ed.2d 605, 612 (1974). A statute may be void for vagueness if it fails to give adequate notice to people of ordinary intelligence concerning the conduct it proscribes, <em>Schwartzmiller v. Gardner, </em>752 F.2d 1341, 1345 (9th Cir.1984), or if it fails to establish minimal guidelines to govern law enforcement or others who must enforce the statute. <em>Kolender v. Lawson, </em>461 U.S. 352, 357-58, 103 S.Ct. 1855, 1858-59, 75 L.Ed.2d 903, 908-09 (1983); <em>State v. Larsen, </em>135 Idaho 754, 756, 24 P.3d 702, 704 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\">A statute may be challenged as unconstitutionally vague on its face or as applied to a defendant\u2019s conduct. For a \u201cfacial vagueness\u201d challenge to be successful, \u201cthe complainant must demonstrate that the law is impermissibly vague in \u00e1ll of its applications.\u201d <em>Hoffman Estates, </em>455 U.S. at 497, 102 S.Ct. at 1193, 71 L.Ed.2d at 371. In other words, the challenger must show that the enactment is invalid <em>in toto. </em>To succeed on an \u201cas applied\u201d- vagueness challenge, a complainant must show that the statute, as applied to the defendant\u2019s conduct, failed to provide fair notice that the defendant\u2019s conduct was proscribed or failed to provide sufficient guidelines such that the police had unbridled discretion in determining whether to arrest him. A \u201cfacial vagueness\u201d analysis is mutually exclusive from an \u201cas applied\u201d analysis. <em>See Schwartzmiller, supra </em>at 1346.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">Neither the magistrate nor the district court examined the constitutionality of I.C. \u00a7 18-7008(8) as it applied to Korsen\u2019s specific conduct in this case. Nor did they examine the statute <em>in toto. </em>Rather, they applied a hybridized form of the facial test, which ordinarily is used to determine if a statute is void in all its applications, by considering the statute only in its application to public property. By finding the statute vague, not as applied to Korsen\u2019s conduct, but as to all applications on public property alone, the magistrate and the district court used an improper standard for determining whether the statute was facially vague. It was improper to conclude that the statute is invalid on its face as applied to public property, because the standard to sustain a facial challenge requires that a statute be held impermissibly vague in <em>all of its applications. See Hoffman Estates, 455 U.S. </em>at 497, 102 S.Ct. at 1193, 71 L.Ed.2d at 370. Furthermore, because the magistrate failed to examine the individual conduct of Korsen, consideration of the \u201cas applied\u201d standard with respect to only public property was in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-8\">Under our standard of independent .review, this Court will consider the constitutional challenges raised in this case. As previously stated, in a facial challenge to a legislative enactment, \u201cthe challenger must establish that no set of circumstances exists under which the Act would be valid.\u201d <em>United States v. Salerno, </em>481 U.S. 739, 745, 107 S.Ct. 2095, 2100, 95 L.Ed.2d 697, 707 (1987). <em>See also Hoffman Estates, supra, </em>455 U.S. at 498, 102 S.Ct. at 1193, 71 L.Ed.2d at 371; <em>State v. Newman, </em>108 Idaho 5, 12, 696 P.2d 856, 863 (1985), <em>citing Steffel v. Thompson, </em>415 U.S. 452, 474, 94 S.Ct. 1209, 1223, 39 L.Ed.2d 505, 523 (1974). Clearly, Idaho\u2019s trespass statute can be constitutionally applied. As succinctly stated by this Court in <em>State v. Missamore, </em>119 Idaho 27, 803 P.2d 528 (1990): \u201cAll that is required for an I.C. \u00a7 18-7008(8) violation is that the defendant refuse to leave property that belongs to another after being so requested by the owner or authorized agent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 32, 803 P.2d at 533. In <em>Missamore, </em>the defendant was convicted of trespass based on evidence that she was on the private property of Mr. and Mrs. Schmidt; that they asked her repeatedly to leave the property; and that she refused.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>Because the Court has applied the statute to specific conduct, it is not so vague as to specify \u201cno standard of conduct at all\u201d in any application. <em>See Schwartzmiller, supra </em>at 1348.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>When Korsen indicated that he would not leave the department offices, even after the request of the regional director in the presence of a police officer, Korsen was subject to a charge under the statute. There is no ambiguity in the language of the statute, whose terms are to be given their commonly understood, everyday meanings. <em>Ada County Assessor v. Roman Catholic Diocese, </em>123 Idaho 425, 849 P.2d 98 (1993). Nor has the statute been given a limiting judicial construction <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> toward avoiding a possible infirmity for vagueness. <em>See State v. Cobb, </em>132 Idaho 195, 969 P.2d 244 (1998), <em>citing State v. Richards, </em>127 Idaho 31, 896 P.2d 357 (Ct.App.1995). The statute makes no distinction between private and public property. Furthermore, the statute informs the public of the prohibited conduct, that is, remaining willfully on property belonging to another after having been asked to leave. Therefore, the statute gives fair notice of the conduct that is made criminal by the statute. Similarly, the core of circumstances to which the trespassing provision unquestionably applies is the willful refusal to leave the premises after having been asked to do so by one in authority. The statute does not allow for unbridled discretion in police enforcement. Indeed, the police have no discretion when enforcing the statute on any type of property; any person who refuses to leave after receiving a warning is subject to arrest. See, e.g. <em>Daniel v. City of Tampa, Florida, </em>38 F.3d 546, 551 (11th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b771-3\">Therefore, neither the magistrate\u2019s nor the district court\u2019s conclusion that the statute is void for vagueness can stand. We hold that 1.C. \u00a7 18-7008(8) is not unconstitutional under the void-for-vagueness doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">2. <em>Unconstitutional Overbreadth</em></p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">The State also challenges the district court\u2019s ruling that I.C. \u00a7 18-7008(8) is over-broad as applied to public property as an alternative basis chosen by the district court to uphold the magistrate\u2019s dismissal of the trespass charge against Korsen. The State argues that, as with the vagueness analysis, the district court improperly used a hybrid test intertwining the \u201cfacial\u201d analysis and the \u201cas applied\u201d analysis in reviewing the constitutional scope of I.C. \u00a7 18-7008(8).</p>\n<p id=\"b771-14\">The statutory crime with which Korsen was charged consists of a refusal to leave real property after being notified to depart by the owner or authorized agent of the owner. Korsen argues that the district court correctly interpreted the statute as seeking to curb constitutionally protected speech, specifically his right to petition the government for redress of grievances (regarding his child support obligations), as provided by the express language of the First Amendment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He asserts that I.C. \u00a7 18-7008(8) sweeps too broadly and includes otherwise lawful activities and speech traditionally accorded protection in public places.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-15\">The question of whether a statute regulates constitutionally protected conduct should begin the court\u2019s analysis of an over-breadth challenge. <em>See State v. Bitt, </em>118 Idaho 584, 589, 798 P.2d 43, 48 (1990). If the answer to this first step is in the affirmative, then the next step asks whether the statute precludes a significant amount of the constitutionally protected conduct. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b771-16\">The overbreadth doctrine is aimed at statutes which, though designed to prohibit legitimately regulated conduct, include within their prohibitions constitutionally protected freedoms. <em>State v. Leferink, </em>133 Idaho 780, 785, 992 P.2d 775, 780 (1999), <em>citing State v. Richards, </em>127 Idaho 31, 896 P.2d 357 (Ct.App.1995). When a statute may deter protected speech only to some unknown extent, we cannot justify invalidating the statute and thereby prohibit the government from regulating conduct within its power to proscribe. <em>Broadrick v. Oklahoma, </em>413 U.S. 601, 615, 93 S.Ct. 2908, 2917, 37 L.Ed.2d 830, 841 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b772-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>\u201cIf the overbreadth is \u2018substantial,\u2019 the law may not be enforced against anyone, including the party before the court, until it is narrowed to reach only unprotected activity, whether by legislative action or by judicial construction or partial invalidation.\u201d <em>State v. Leferink supra, citing Brocket v. Spokane Arcades, Inc., </em>472 U.S. 491, 503-04, 105 S.Ct. 2794, 2801-02, 86 L.Ed.2d 394, 405-06 (1985). Overbreadth, however, is not substantial if, \u201cdespite some possibly impermissible application, the \u2018remainder of the statute ... covers a whole range of easily identifiable and constitutionally proscribable ... conduct....\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Leferink, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\">The United States Supreme Court has recognized that the overbreadth doctrine should be applied sparingly. In <em>Broadrick v. Oklahoma, supra, </em>the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-5\">[F]acial overbreadth adjudication is an exception to our traditional rules of practice and ... its function, a limited one at the outset, attenuates.as the otherwise unprotected behavior that it forbids the State to sanction moves from \u201cpure speech\u201d toward conduct and that conduct \u2014 even if expressive \u2014 falls within the scope of otherwise valid criminal laws that reflect legitimate state interests in maintaining comprehensive controls over harmful, constitutionally unprotected conduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ayi\"><em>Id. </em>at 615, 93 S.Ct. at 2917, 37 L.Ed.2d at 842.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">A statute that is found to be overbroad may not be enforced at all, even against speech or conduct that could constitutionally be prohibited by a more narrowly drawn statute. <em>Id. </em>at 613, 93 S.Ct. at 2916, 37 L.Ed.2d at 840. However, a statute will not be invalidated for overbreadth merely because it is possible to imagine some unconstitutional applications. <em>Members of City Council v. Taxpayers of Vincent, </em>466 U.S. 789, 800, 104 S.Ct. 2118, 2126, 80 L.Ed.2d 772, 783 (1984). Rather, \u201cthere must be a realistic danger that the statute itself will significantly compromise recognized First Amendment protections of parties not before the Court ...\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 801-02, 104 S.Ct. at 2126, 80 L.Ed.2d at 784. Therefore, the Supreme Court has developed a requirement that the overbreadth must be \u201csubstantial\u201d before the statute will be held unconstitutional on its face. <em>Id. </em>Only if the statute \u201cintrude[s] upon a substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct\u201d may it be struck down for overbreadth. <em>State v. Newman, </em>108 Idaho at 11, 696 P.2d at 862 <em>(citing Village of Hoffman Estates v. Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc., </em>455 U.S. 489, 494, 102 S.Ct. 1186, 1191, 71 L.Ed.2d 362, 368 (1982)).</p>\n<p id=\"b772-8\">As with its vagueness analysis, the district court did not find I.C. \u00a7 18-7008(8) unconstitutional under a strictly \u201cas applied\u201d analysis, which requires an examination of the statute as it applied to Korsen\u2019s particular conduct in this case. The court did not find that Korsen\u2019s speech was wrongfully suppressed, that he was a victim of discrimination because of his viewpoints, or that he otherwise suffered a violation of a freedom protected by the First Amendment. Nor did the court use a purely facial overbreadth test, examining the statute <em>in toto. </em>Instead, the court applied a hybrid analysis, applying the analysis for facial overbreadth (determining whether the statute is unconstitutional in a substantial portion of the cases to which it applies) but only in its application to public, not private, property. The district court failed to determine, under the correct facial analysis, whether the statute, which makes no distinction between public and private property, is unconstitutional in a substantial portion of public <em>and private </em>property cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-9\">The district court ruled that I.C. \u00a7 18-7008(8) is unconstitutionally overbroad as it applies to all public property, regardless of the conduct or speech in which a particular defendant is engaging on that property. By finding the statute overbroad, not as applied to Korsen\u2019s conduct, but as to all applications on public property, the district court erroneously combined the facial and \u201cas applied\u201d standards of overbreadth. As with vagueness claims, these standards cannot be combined. To find that a statute is facially overbroad, and therefore unenforceable as to everyone, and not just the defendant, requires a determination that it is invalid <em>in toto </em>and therefore incapable of any valid application. <em>Newman, </em>108 Idaho at 11 n. 7, 696 P.2d at 862. When a criminal statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>contains a general prohibition that makes no distinction among different applications of the prohibition, a court cannot conclude that a statute is facially overbroad only in one particular application, but not overbroad in another. <em>See Schwartzmiller, </em>752 F.2d at 1346.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-4\">By not choosing either the facial or the \u201cas applied\u201d analysis, but instead improperly combining them both to reach its conclusion that I.C. \u00a7 18-7008(8) is overbroad, the district court erred as a matter of law. Having reached that conclusion, this Court will determine the issue <em>de novo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">In <em>Broadrick, </em>the Supreme Court observed that where <em>conduct </em>is involved, the over-breadth of a statute must be both real and substantial when judged in relation to its legitimate sweep, and whatever problems exist should be cured in a particular case by case analysis of the fact situation to which the statute\u2019s sanctions, assuredly, may not be applied. 413 U.S. at 614-15, 93 S.Ct. at 2917-18, 37 L.Ed.2d at 841^42. Idaho\u2019s trespass statute is not aimed at regulating speech or communication in any form. Contrary to the district court\u2019s ruling, in light of the statute\u2019s plainly legitimate sweep in regulating conduct, it is not so substantially over-broad that any overbreadth that may exist cannot be cured on a ease-by-case basis. <em>Id. </em>at 615-16, 93 S.Ct. at 2917-18, 37 L.Ed.2d at 841-42.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">As an example of the statute\u2019s reaching constitutionally protected speech, the district court pointed out the situation of people entering the Capitol to meet with legislators, asserting that, because the threat of prosecution under the trespass statute \u201cpotentially chills such clearly protected activity, the Court finds that the statute is unconstitutional in a substantial portion of the cases to which it applies.\u201d This conclusion, however, illustrates the district court\u2019s erroneous application of the facial overbreadth doctrine. A statute will not be invalidated for over-breadth merely because it is possible to come up with a hypothetical situation in which the statute is unconstitutional as applied. <em>Taxpayers for Vincent, </em>466 U.S. at 800, 104 S.Ct. at 2126, 80 L.Ed.2d at 783. Rather, \u201cthere must be a realistic danger that the statute itself will significantly compromise recognized First Amendment protections of parties not before the Court____\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 801-02, 104 S.Ct. at 2126, 80 L.Ed.2d at 784.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-13\">Not addressed by the district court is the statute\u2019s application, without constitutional implications, to private property or to cases involving purely conduct and not speech. Physical presence in a public building dedicated to public uses other than that of a public thoroughfare, even presence for the purpose of communicating ideas, is not \u201cpure speech.\u201d Not all conduct claimed to have communicative purpose is protected as speech by the First Amendment. <em>See Cox v. Louisiana, </em>379 U.S. 536, 555, 85 S.Ct. 453, 464, 13 L.Ed.2d 471, 484 (1965). The statute is also capable of constitutional application to government-owned nonpublic forums, such as government office buildings or portions of college campuses that, unlike traditional public forums such as a public street, public park or sidewalk, or the steps of the state Capitol building, are not open to the public for expressive activities.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>See Perry Educ. Ass\u2019n v. Perry Local Educators\u2019 Ass\u2019n, </em>460 U.S. 37, 45-46, 103 S.Ct. 948, 954-956, 74 L.Ed.2d 794, 804-805 (1983); <em>Bader v. State, </em>15 S.W.3d 599, 604-05 (Tex.App.2000). The facts in Korsen\u2019s case do not provide a situation where the exercise of free speech was impinged. Rather, Korsen showed up at the Health and Welfare office to conduct legitimate business, <em>i.e., </em>to discuss his child support obligation with the agency charged with overseeing collection of child support. When it appeared that his desire to obtain modification of the obligation could not be obtained at that office but, as he was informed, was a matter that properly should be addressed to the court where the obligation was established, the purpose of his visit to the Health and Welfare office came to an end.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-14\">Assuming that a criminal trespass prosecution is filed pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 18-7008(8) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>against a person on public property who is exercising his or her free speech rights, the statute could be attacked as applied to that constitutionally-protected conduct. This does not render the statute substantially overbroad. A reasonable reading of I.C. \u00a7 18-7008(8) shows that the statute does not reach a substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct. The district court therefore committed reversible error in determining that the statutory language is overbroad.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\">3. <em>Rule 29 Acquittal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">As an alternative to the dismissal based on the unconstitutionality of I.C. \u00a7 18-7008(8), the magistrate also dismissed the case against Korsen pursuant to I.C.R. 29. Specifically, the magistrate found that the State had failed to prove that Korsen gave the director any reason for asking Korsen to leave the premises. At the close of the State\u2019s ease, the magistrate then concluded as a matter of law <em>that the State </em>had not provided sufficient evidence to prove Korsen guilty of criminal trespass.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\"><em>\u201cA </em>defendant is acquitted only when \u2018the ruling of the judge, whatever its label, actually represents a resolution [in the defendant\u2019s favor], correct or not, of some or all of the factual elements of the offense charged.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Scott, </em>437 U.S. 82, 97, 98 S.Ct. 2187, 2197, 57 L.Ed.2d 65, 78 (1978), <em>quoting United States v. Martin Linen Supply Co., </em>430 U.S. 564, 571, 97 S.Ct. 1349, 1354, 51 L.Ed.2d 642, 651 (1977) (brackets in original). In Korsen\u2019s case, the magistrate, \u201cas a result of legal error, determined that the government could not prove a fact that is not necessary to support a conviction.\u201d <em>See United States v. Maker, </em>751 F.2d 614, 625 (3d Cir.1984). The Idaho courts have construed I.C. \u00a7 18-7008(8) to not require that a property owner provide a reason for asking trespassers to get off his land. <em>State v. Missamore, supra; State v. Bowman, </em>124 Idaho 936, 866 P.2d 193 (Ct.App.1993). Accordingly, the magistrate\u2019s acquittal was erroneously based on a lack of evidence that ultimately was not necessary to convict Korsen of trespass. This Court concludes that it was error for the magistrate to dismiss the ease under Rule 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-7\">4. Double Jeopardy</p>\n<p id=\"b774-8\">In response to the State\u2019s claim in the appellate proceeding before the district court that the magistrate erred in dismissing the case, Korsen asserted that if the magistrate erred then Korsen was protected from a retrial on the charge by virtue of double jeopardy principles. Although the district court ruled against the State and upheld the magistrate\u2019s dismissal, the district court also ruled that double jeopardy did not apply because the acquittal by the magistrate was based on an erroneous legal ruling. As a result of the State\u2019s appeal to this Court, Korsen has cross-appealed, challenging the district court\u2019s determination concerning the propriety of a remand for further proceedings in the event this Court upholds the constitutionality of the statute. Korsen argues that even if the Rule 29 dismissal was made in error, double jeopardy had attached, barring a retrial on the trespass charge in the event of a remand. We hold that because the magistrate\u2019s dismissal was based upon an erroneous legal, not factual, conclusion, double jeopardy does not bar a retrial on the trespass charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-9\">The Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides that no person shall be \u201csubject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.\u201d Similarly, Article 1, \u00a7 13 of the Idaho Constitution provides that \u201c[n]o person shall be twice put in jeopardy for the same offense.\u201d Jeopardy attaches in a jury trial when the jury is impaneled and sworn. <em>State v. Santana, </em>135 Idaho 58, 64, 14 P.3d 378, 384 (Ct.App.2000). The attachment of jeopardy will not always bar retrial, however. \u201c[A] defendant\u2019s valued right to have his trial completed by a particular tribunal must in some instances be subordinated to the public\u2019s interest in fair trials designed to end in just judgments.\u201d <em>Wade v. Hunter, </em>336 U.S. 684, 689, 69 S.Ct. 834, 837, 93 L.Ed. 974, 978 (1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b774-10\">If the trial court enters a judgment of acquittal based on a determination that the evidence is factually insufficient to support a charge, the prohibition against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>double jeopardy bars a retrial on that charge. <em>Smalis v. Pennsylvania, </em>476 U.S. 140, 144-46, 106 S.Ct. 1745, 1748-49, 90 L.Ed.2d 116, 121-22 (1986); <em>United States v. Scott, </em>437 U.S. 82, 97, 98 S.Ct. 2187, 2197, 57 L.Ed.2d 65, 78 (1978); <em>State v. Lewis, </em>96 Idaho 743, 750, 536 P.2d 738, 745 (1975). Thus, only if the trial court, in terminating the proceedings, actually resolved in favor of the defendant a factual element necessary for a criminal conviction, can a dismissal appropriately be deemed an acquittal. <em>United States v. Maker, </em>751 F.2d 614, 622 (3rd Cir.1984) (outlining eases holding that there is an \u201cacquittal\u201d only if the trial court\u2019s disposition actually represented a resolution of an essential factual element of the offense charged). The magistrate\u2019s characterization of its action, for example, as an I.C.R. 29 acquittal, is not dispositive on the issue of whether the dismissal was an acquittal. <em>Scott, </em>437 U.S. at 97, 98 S.Ct. at 2197, 57 L.Ed.2d at 78 (label used by the trial court in dismissing charges is not dispositive); <em>United States v. Kennings, </em>861 F.2d 381, 384 n. 5 (3rd Cir.1988) (trial court\u2019s reference to Rule 29 is not dispositive on the issue of whether the dismissal was an acquittal).</p>\n<p id=\"b775-4\">Thus, to decide whether double jeopardy bars a retrial in this case, it must be determined if the magistrate court resolved in Korsen\u2019s favor an \u201cessential element of the offense charged.\u201d <em>Maker, </em>751 F.2d at 622-23, <em>quoting Carter v. Estelle, </em>677 F.2d 427, 452-53 (5th Cir.1982). The record shows that the magistrate dismissed the trespass charge against Korsen on the ground that the trespass statute is unconstitutionally vague as applied to public property and, alternatively, on the ground that the state official who requested that Korsen leave the Health and Welfare office failed to express an adequate reason for doing so. The determination that the trespass statute requires this \u201cadequate reason\u201d element was a legal one. The determination that the reason in this case was not adequate was, at least arguably, factual. However, the finding did not actually determine in Korsen\u2019s favor any of the essential elements of the crime of trespass. Rather, by requiring proof of an adequate reason for asking someone to leave public property, the magistrate effectively created an additional statutory element to I.C. \u00a7 18-7008(8) that the law does not require. Because the magistrate\u2019s determination that there was inadequate reason for asking Korsen to leave the Health and Welfare offices did not resolve an essential element of trespassing, the dismissal of the ease on that ground does not constitute an \u201cacquittal\u201d implicating double jeopardy concerns. Retrial is therefore not barred. <em>See Maker, </em>751 F.2d at 623 (double jeopardy not implicated and retrial not barred where trial court, as a result of legal error, determined that government could not prove a fact that was not necessary to support a conviction).</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">The district court\u2019s conclusion that retrial is not barred is consistent with the policies underlying the principle of double jeopardy. As the Third Circuit noted, \u201c[t]his is not a case in which a second trial is permitted \u2018for the purpose of affording the prosecution another opportunity to supply evidence which it failed to muster in the first proceedings.\u2019 \u201d <em>Maker, </em>751 F.2d at 624, <em>quoting Burks v. United States, </em>437 U.S. 1, 11, 98 S.Ct. 2141, 2147, 57 L.Ed.2d 1, 9 (1978). \u201cInstead, this is a ease in which the [trial] court, as the result of a legal error, determined that the government could not prove a fact that is not necessary to support a conviction.\u201d <em>Maker, </em>751 F.2d at 624.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-7\">Korsen argues that the facts in <em>State v. Lewis, </em>96 Idaho 743, 536 P.2d 738 (1975), are analogous to this case, and that double jeopardy should similarly be found. In <em>Lewis, </em>this Court found that the district court had erroneously dismissed rape and kidnapping charges. The Court determined that the trial court erroneously viewed the evidence regarding the kidnapping charge. <em>Id. </em>at 748, 536 P.2d at 743. As to the rape charges, however, the Court specifically noted that it was unclear from the record whether the lower court had dismissed on the basis of an erroneous evaluation of the evidence or upon an erroneous interpretation of the legal elements necessary to prove rape. We found double jeopardy applicable only because \u201cthe dismissals <em>might </em>have been based upon a factual determination____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 748-50, 536 P.2d at 743-45 (emphasis added). Thus, the holding of <em>Lewis </em>is entirely consistent with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>cases that hold that the double jeopardy clause is not offended, and therefore retrial is not barred, by a dismissal based upon an erroneous conclusion that the evidence is inadequate to prove an element not necessary to support the charged offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\">The magistrate below, as a result of a legal error, concluded that the State failed to prove a fact that was not necessary to support a conviction for trespass. It was a misapprehension of the law \u2014 that a legitimate reason to ask the trespasser to leave the premises was one element of the trespass crime \u2014 that led to the magistrate\u2019s ruling to dismiss pursuant to Rule 29, not the resolution of a factual dispute in favor of the defendant. Accordingly, the dismissal on this basis did not constitute an \u201cacquittal\u201d necessary to trigger the double jeopardy prohibition, and retrial is not barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">The magistrate\u2019s conclusion that I.C. \u00a7 18-7008(8) is void for vagueness and the district court\u2019s conclusion that the statute is unconstitutional as overbroad are reversed. The magistrate\u2019s order dismissing the charge is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent herewith.</p>\n<judges id=\"b776-7\">Chief Justice TROUT, and Justices SCHROEDER, and EISMANN concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b768-9\">.

Therefore, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-10\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b776-11\">This Court determines whether a person\u2019s constitutional rights have been violated independently of the lower court. <em>Willie v. Bd. of Trustees, </em>138 Idaho 131, 59 P.3d 302 (2002) (citing <em>Bradbury v. Idaho Judicial Council, </em>136 Idaho 63, 67-68, 28 P.3d 1006, 1010-11 (2001)). A statute that prohibits legitimately regulated conduct, but also prohibits constitutionally protected conduct, may be subject to invalidation under the overbreadth doctrine. <em>State v. Leferink, </em>133 Idaho 780, 784, 992 P.2d 775, 779 (1999). The first step in applying the overbreadth doctrine requires a determination of whether the statute in question regulates constitutionally protected conduct. State <em>v. Bitt, </em>118 Idaho 584, 587-88, 798 P.2d 43, 46\u201447 (1990). If that question is answered affirmatively, the second step in applying the overbreadth doctrine requires one to determine whether the statute precludes significantly more protected conduct than is necessary. <em>Id. </em>In a situation where a statute is purportedly overbroad as applied, this Court need only consider whether the statute precluded a significant amount of the defendant\u2019s protected conduct. <em>See State v. Hammersley, </em>134 Idaho 816, 820-21, 10 P.3d 1285, 1288 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b776-13\">Under I.C. \u00a7 17-7008(8), a person willfully commits trespass, a crime punishable as a misdemeanor, when he/she is notified by the owner, or an authorized agent, of real property to immediately depart and refuses to do so upon notification. The statute makes no attempt to distinguish between privately or publicly owned real property. The statute, while not directly implicating protected conduct, clearly may regulate protected conduct, freedom of speech occurring on publicly owned property, in particular.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-14\">Having answered the question whether the trespass statute regulates protected conduct in the affirmative, the next question in an \u201cas applied\u201d analysis is whether the trespass statute precluded significantly more of Korsen\u2019s protected conduct than necessary. The record shows Korsen went to the office of the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare (Health and Welfare), a publicly owned building located on public property, in order to discuss a government imposed child support obligation. Korsen informed a- security guard he might get loud. As predicted, Korsen became loud while discussing his case with a Health and Welfare employee after he was informed only a court could modify his child support obligation. At some point, the security guard asked if he should call the police, to which Korsen replied it would be a good idea to call the police. Korsen refused to wait for the police outside the building. When the police arrived, the Health and Welfare Director at the building was informed he must first ask Korsen to leave the building before the police could arrest him. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>The Director discussed Korsen\u2019s support obligations with him, but advised Korsen only a court could modify his support obligation as he requested. Korsen stated he refused to leave the building until someone at Health and Welfare did something to help him. Though he raised his voice, Korsen never used profanity or offensive language, nor did he threaten anyone, physically or verbally. The Director eventually asked Korsen to leave and when he refused, the officer arrested him for trespassing.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-10\">The majority states Korsen went to the Health and Welfare building to conduct legitimate business, but when that legitimate business ended and Korsen refused to leave, he was in violation of I.C. \u00a7 18-7008(8). The majority correctly states the Health and Welfare building is not a traditional public forum. However, it is a public building located on public property and Korsen did have a clear right to be there to discuss a state imposed support obligation. Korsen, in exercising his First Amendment rights in a public building to public personnel, reacted to what is undoubtedly a very emotional issue for him. I.C. \u00a7 18-7008(8) is a criminal statute meant to penalize criminal behavior. The facts in the record simply do not support the idea that Korsen\u2019s behavior rose to the level of criminal conduct. The trespass statute, in providing a legal means for Health and Welfare to rid itself of Korsen, a citizen occupying its building, precluded significantly more of Korsen\u2019s protected speech than necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-11\">It is arguable that the decisions of the magistrate and district courts take the same position as this dissent. Both courts found I.C. \u00a7 18-7008(8) vague and/or overbroad as applied to public property. Rather than engaging in a \u201chybrid\u201d analysis that confused the \u201cas applied\u201d and \u201cfacially\u201d vague and/or overbroad analyses as the majority finds, it seems both lower courts were stating I.C. \u00a7 18-7008(8) was vague and/or overbroad as applied to Korsen\u2019s exercise of his First Amendment rights on public property.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-19\">For these reasons, I would affirm the judgment of the magistrate court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
