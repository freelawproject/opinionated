Suiter appeals his conviction on the grounds that his conviction violates his freedom of speech pursuant to the First Amendment of the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-22\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-23\">FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b72-24\">On April 3, 1998, Suiter went to the Canyon County Courthouse and spoke to a detective in the records division about a fraudulent check ease in which one of Suiter\u2019s friends was the victim. Suiter explained that he was acting at his friend\u2019s request and as his agent. The detective responded that without some sort of verification from the crime victim, Suiter was unauthorized to act on the victim\u2019s behalf, and the detective could not take a complaint or assist Suiter in an investigation of the alleged check fraud. Suiter became frustrated with the officer\u2019s responses to his inquiries. As the conversation progressed, Suiter became agitated and critical of the sheriffs office. The detective told Suiter that he was not going to listen to criticism. Subsequently, the detective asked Suiter to calm down. At that point, Suiter said \u201cHey, fuck off,\u201d (Suiter\u2019s statement or Suiter\u2019s speech) and turned to leave. Suiter was then stopped by other officers and cited for disturbing the peace.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-25\">Those who heard the profanity included another sheriffs deputy, two clerks in the records division of the sheriffs office, and two civilian bystanders. The civilians were a woman (Villireal) and her nineteen-year-old daughter. The woman testified that she was not angered by what she heard but was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>surprised to hear such language in the courthouse. She said that Suiter\u2019s language didn\u2019t really bother her. The daughter was also surprised, but not agitated, by hearing the \u201cf-word\u201d in the courthouse. Personnel of the sheriffs office who overheard the conversation said Suiter\u2019s agitated profanity disrupted their work or disrupted their peace and quiet. The witnesses described Suiter\u2019s voice as \u201cloud,\u201d \u201cnot combative,\u201d \u201cfairly loud,\u201d \u201cnot real loud,\u201d \u201cseemed to raise a little bit,\u201d or it \u201csounded like he was upset\u201d when he uttered the vulgarity; no one characterized it as shouting, or screaming.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\">Prior to trial, Suiter moved to dismiss the case. Suiter failed to appear at the hearing on his motion to dismiss and the magistrate denied the motion. The case proceeded to a jury trial. During the trial, Suiter again moved to dismiss the case. The magistrate also denied this motion. A jury found Suiter guilty of disturbing the peace.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">Suiter appealed to the district court on the grounds that his conviction violated his First Amendment right to freedom of speech. The district court affirmed the judgment of conviction. Suiter again appealed, and the Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment of conviction. Following the Court of Appeal\u2019s decision, Suiter timely filed, and this Court granted, a petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b73-8\">When reviewing a decision of a magistrate following intermediate appeals, this Court independently examines the proceedings in the magistrate division and gives \u201cdue consideration, but not deference, to the [intermediate] court\u2019s appellate decision.\u201d <em>State v. Hammersley, </em>134 Idaho 816, 818, 10 P.3d 1285, 1287 (2000) (citing <em>State v. Salsbury, </em>129 Idaho 307, 308, 924 P.2d 208, 209 (1996); <em>Ireland v. Ireland, </em>123 Idaho 955, 957-58, 855 P.2d 40, 42-43 (1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-9\">A claim contesting the constitutionality of a statute presents a question of law warranting de novo review of the trial court\u2019s ruling. <em>See State v. Cobb, </em>132 Idaho 195, 197, 969 P.2d 244, 246 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-12\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b73-13\">The conflict of constitutionally protected speech and the protection provided our citizenry by criminal statutes demands a judicial balancing act. Here the balance tips toward freedom of speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-14\">A. Suiter\u2019s Conviction Violated His First Amendment Rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-15\">Suiter argues that he was convicted solely on the grounds of the content of his statement to the detective and that his statement constituted protected speech pursuant to the First Amendment. The state contends that Suiter\u2019s statement was not the basis for his conviction. Rather, the foundation for Suiter\u2019s conviction was loud and boisterous conduct. Furthermore, even if Suiter\u2019s conviction did rest on the content of his statement, it would not be wrongful because Suiter\u2019s statement falls into the category of fighting words that do not receive First Amendment protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-16\">1. Suiter\u2019s Statement Is Protected Speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-17\">The First Amendment states in pertinent part that \u201cCongress shall make no law ... abridging the freedom of speech.\u201d U.S. Const. Amend. I. The freedoms preserved by the First Amendment apply to the states through the 14th Amendment. <em>Hammersley, </em>134 Idaho at 819, 10 P.3d at 1288. A criminal conviction cannot be based on the content of constitutionally protected speech. <em>Cohen v. California, </em>403 U.S. 15, 18-19, 91 S.Ct. 1780, 1784-85, 29 L.Ed.2d 284, 289-90 (1971). States may, however, punish the use of words within narrowly limited classes of speech such as \u201cfighting words.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 20, 91 S.Ct. at 1785, 29 L.Ed.2d at 291.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-18\">\u201cFighting words\u201d are \u201cthose personally abusive epithets which, when addressed to the ordinary citizen, are, as a matter of common knowledge, inherently likely to provoke violent reaction.\u201d <em>Id.; </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number><em>Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, </em>315 U.S. 568, 62 S.Ct. 766, 86 L.Ed. 1031 (1942). Fighting words \u201care essentially a non-speech element of communication ... subject to state regulation because they do not constitute an <em>essential </em>part of any expression of ideas.\u201d <em>Hammersley, </em>134 Idaho at 819, 10 P.3d at 1288 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">Though boorish, impolite, and offensive, Suiter\u2019s statement is protected speech not subject to the \u201cfighting words\u201d exception-to the First Amendment. While Suiter\u2019s statement was vulgar and impolite, the phrase is relatively common. Also, unlike other vulgar phrases containing the same expletive, Suiter\u2019s statement cannot be characterized as a personally abusive epithet because it does not demean or characterize a person to whom it is directed. Consequently, Suiter\u2019s statement is unlikely to provoke a violent reaction when addressed to the ordinary citizen. Therefore, Suiter\u2019s statement does not fall within the fighting words exception to First Amendment protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">2. The Record Does Not Disclose Whether Protected Speech Played A Role In Securing Suiter\u2019s Conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">To convict one for disturbing the peace pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 18-6409, the state must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that one \u201cmaliciously and wilfully [sic] disturbed] the peace or quiet of any neighborhood, family or person\u201d in one of five manners:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-7\">by [1] loud or unusual noise, or by [2] tumultuous or offensive conduct, or by [3] threatening, traducing, quarreling, challenging to fight or fighting, or [4] fir[ing] any gun or pistol, or [5] use[ing] any vulgar, profane or indecent language within the presence or hearing of children, in a loud and boisterous manner____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b74-12\"><em>Id. </em>(bracketed numbering added).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The evidence at trial could only potentially support Suiter\u2019s conviction on the ground that he disturbed the peace \u201cby loud or unusual noise, or by tumultuous or offensive conduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b74-13\">The trial court instructed the jury that \u201c \u2018[m]alice\u2019 and \u2018maliciously\u2019 mean the desire to annoy or injure another or the intent to do a wrongful act.\u201d The jury was not instructed that Suiter\u2019s statement was protected speech and that its content could not be considered in determining whether he acted maliciously, disturbed the peace, made an unusual noise, or whether his conduct was offensive.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-14\">The state was allowed to argue that the jury should convict Suiter because of \u201cthe <em>language </em>coupled with the actions of Mr. Suiter, disrupting these people, disrupting the courthouse, an official place of business .... And that\u2019s <em>evidenced by the type of language he </em>used____The <em>offensiveness of this language </em>directed at Detective Lewis, and its impact on other individuals and his conduct____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b74-17\">The state adduced evidence at trial that the <em>words </em>used by Suiter disturbed witness\u2019 peace. In fact, the evidence at trial tended to show that others in the vicinity of the detective and Suiter were oblivious to the conversation between them until Suiter made his boorish statement. One witness testified that the only thing that disturbed her was Suiter\u2019s use of the expletive in question. In addition to the evidence and argument in the record referring to the content of Suiter\u2019s statement, there is also evidence in the record that creates a jury question regarding whether Suiter disturbed the peace either \u201cby loud or unusual noise or by tumultuous or offensive conduct\u201d without regard to the content of his speech. I.C. \u00a7 18-6409.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-18\">In closing, the state argued that the evidence showed that the \u201cwitnesses ... had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>not ... heard this <em>type of language </em>being used in public in these circumstances. And when you couple that with this government office ... people trying to conduct business ... the state would submit that Suiter ... did disturb the peace ____\u201d The state also argues that \u201c[t]he bare language itself ... is not disturbing the peace. What is disturbing the peace is the offensive conduct, <em>the use of the F word </em>in that phrase directed to [the] Detective.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">It was error for the court to allow the state to argue that the content of Suiter\u2019s protected speech could, even in part, support a conviction for disturbing the peace. Additionally, even in the absence of the state\u2019s arguments regarding the content of Suiter\u2019s statement, the court erred by failing to instruct the jury that it could not consider the content of Suiter\u2019s protected speech when determining his guilt or innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">3. It Was Reversible Error For The Court To Allow The State To Argue For Suiter\u2019s Conviction Based On The Content Of His Speech And Not To Instruct The Jury That The Content Of Suiter\u2019s Statement Could Not Be Considered In Determining His Guilt Or Innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-8\">I.C.R. 52 states that \u201c[a]ny error ... which does not affect substantial rights shall be disregarded.\u201d In order to determine whether an error is harmless or reversible, we \u201cmust inquire whether it appears, beyond a reasonable doubt, that there was no reasonable possibility that the error contributed to [the] conviction.\u201d <em>State v. Trevino, </em>132 Idaho 888, 895, 980 P.2d 552, 559 (1999) (citing <em>State v. Roy, </em>127 Idaho 228, 231, 899 P.2d 441, 444 (1995)).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-9\">Based on the jury instructions and trial transcript, it is impossible to determine whether the jury actually considered the content of Suiter\u2019s statement in determining whether he was malicious, whether he disturbed the peace, or whether he did so \u201cby loud or unusual noise or by tumultuous or offensive conduct.\u201d I.C. \u00a7 18-6409. The state did invite the jury to consider the content of Suiter\u2019s statement and it is likely the jury did consider the content of Suiter\u2019s statement. Moreover, the jury instructions did nothing to prevent the jury from considering the content of Suiter\u2019s statement. In light of these errors, we cannot say, \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt, that there was no reasonable possibility that the error[s] contributed to [Suiter\u2019s] conviction.\u201d <em>Trevino, </em>132 Idaho at 895, 980 P.2d at 559. Therefore, we vacate Suiter\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-11\">There is sufficient evidence in the record to create a jury question regarding whether Suiter disturbed the peace \u201cby loud or unusual noise or by tumultuous or offensive conduct\u201d without regard for the content of his statement. I.C. \u00a7 18-6409. Therefore, this case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-12\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-13\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b75-14\">Suiter\u2019s statement is protected speech pursuant to the First Amendment. The trial court erred by allowing the state to argue that the content of Suiter\u2019s statement could be considered evidence of whether he committed the crime alleged. The trial court also erred by failing to instruct the jury that Suiter\u2019s statement was protected speech, the content of which could not be considered in determining whether Suiter committed the alleged crime. We cannot say that these errors did not contribute to Suiter\u2019s conviction, Therefore, we vacate Suiter\u2019s conviction and remand this case for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b75-15\">Chief Justice TROUT, Justices SCHROEDER, WALTERS, AND EISMANN concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b75-16\">Justice EISMANN,</judges>\n<p id=\"AlV\">SPECIALLY CONCURRING.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-17\">I concur in the majority opinion, but write separately to further address one issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-18\">Athough the language chosen by Mr. Suiter is certainly distasteful, crude, and offensive, under the First Amendment the State cannot excise this one particular scurrilous epithet from public use. <em>Cohen v. California, </em>403 U.S. 15, 91 S.Ct. 1780, 29 L.Ed.2d 284 (1971). As stated by the United States <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>Supreme Court in <em>Cohen, </em>\u201cSurely the State has no right to cleanse public debate to the point where it is grammatically palatable to the most squeamish among us____[W]e cannot indulge the facile assumption that one can forbid particular words without also running a substantial risk of suppressing ideas in the process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 25-26, 91 S.Ct. at 1788, 29 L.Ed.2d at 294.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">In this case, the trial court instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-6\">In order for the defendant, Patrick Sheldon Suiter, to be found guilty of the crime of Disturbing the Peace the State must prove each of the following elements beyond a reasonable doubt:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-7\">1. Every person who maliciously and willfully</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-8\">2. disturbs the peace or quiet of any neighborhood, family or person;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-9\">3. by loud or unusual noise or by tumultuous or offensive conduct, or by threatening, traducing, quarreling, challenging to fight or fighting, or fires any gun or pistol, or uses any vulgar, profane or indecent language within the presence or hearing of children;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-10\">4. in a loud and boisterous manner;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-11\">5. is guilty of a misdemeanor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b76-12\">Although the State argues that Suiter\u2019s conviction can be upheld because he disturbed the peace by speech that was loud and boisterous, the jury instructions required the jury to find \u201ceach of the following elements beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Thus, in order to convict Suiter the jury was required to find both that he was loud and boisterous and that he engaged in conduct described in element number three. Thus, the jury could have convicted Suiter because it found that his speech was \u201coffensive conduct.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b76-13\">When a criminal conviction is based upon speech protected by the First Amendment, the conviction cannot stand if it could have been based, in part, upon a finding that the speech was offensive, vulgar, profane, or indecent. <em>Gooding v. Wilson, </em>405 U.S. 518, 92 S.Ct. 1103, 31 L.Ed.2d 408 (1972); <em>Cohen v. California, </em>403 U.S. 15, 91 S.Ct. 1780, 29 L.Ed.2d 284 (1971). Therefore, if this case is retried upon remand, the jury instructions must be drafted so that the jury cannot consider whether the language chosen by Mr. Suiter was offensive, vulgar, profane, or indecent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b74-8\">.The trial court instructed the jury that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-9\">In order for ... Suiter [ ] to be found guilty of the crime of Disturbing the Peace the State must prove each of the following elements beyond a reasonable doubt:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-10\">1. Every person who maliciously and willfully</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-11\">2. disturbs the peace of any neighborhood, family or person;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-19\">3. by loud or unusual noise or by tumultuous or offensive conduct, or by threatening, traducing, quarreling, challenging to fight or fighting, or fires any gun or pistol, or uses any vulgar, profane or indecent language within the presence or hearing of children;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-20\">4. in a loud and boisterous manner;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-21\">5. is guilty of a misdemeanor.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b76-14\">. There was no evidence that Suiter engaged in conduct that could be described as threatening, traducing, challenging to fight or fighting, or that he fired any gun or pistol. Likewise, there were no children (persons under eighteen years of age) present. The trial court should not have included jury instructions regarding alternative elements that were not supported by evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
