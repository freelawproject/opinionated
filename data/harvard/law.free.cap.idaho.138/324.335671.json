We affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-19\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b384-20\">During the latter part of December 1996, floods and mudslides plagued Boise County due to a series of fierce winter storms. On December 25, 1996, the chairman of the Boise County Board of County Commissioners declared an emergency pursuant to Idaho Code \u00a7 46-1011.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> That declaration of emergency was reduced to writing by resolution adopted on December 30,1996.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b385-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>On December 27, 1996, the Governor issued a proclamation declaring a disaster emergency in Boundary County, Idaho, as a result of severe winter storms creating excessive snowfall and ice conditions throughout the county. The proclamation stated that the Governor declared a state of extreme emergency as described in Idaho Code \u00a7 46-601(a)(2)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and a state of disaster emergency as described in Idaho Code \u00a7 46-1008(2).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It also stated, \u201cThat the nature of the emergency is the occurrence and imminent threat of injury to people and property due to damages caused from accumulated snow and ice.\u201d On December 31, 1996, the Governor amended the proclamation to include Boise County within its provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">As a result of the storms in Boise County, heavy flooding and mudslides closed the highway between Banks and Lowman. On December 30, 1996, Boise County and the plaintiff Inama entered into an agreement to use Inama\u2019s dump truck to haul debris from the flooding and mudslides. Inama then hired David Strieker to drive the truck. Beginning on December 31, 1996, Strieker began driving the dump truck under the direction of the Boise County Road Superintendent and a state employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">On January 1, 1997, the Road Superintendent needed a loader to clear debris. Strieker told him about Inama\u2019s front-end loader, but added that he had no authority to use it. The Road Superintendent told Strieker to get the loader and use it to clear debris from several creeks. Strieker did as he was told. Inama was not present, did not know that his loader was going to be used by the County, and did not consent to that use.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">After Strieker finished using the loader to clear debris from the creeks, the Road Superintendent told him to take the loader to Highway 17 to clear mudslides so that a crew from the electric company could get through to restore power to Garden Valley. Strieker again did as he was instructed. As Strieker was working on the mudslide, the loader developed a hydraulic leak and became inoperable. Strieker parked it and left with the electric company crew to obtain repair mate<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>rials and hydraulic fluid. While they were gone, a massive mudslide swept the loader into the South Fork of the Payette River, destroying the loader.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">On March 10, 1998, Inama filed this action against Boise County seeking to recover the value of his front-end loader and other damages. Ultimately, Boise County filed a motion for summary judgment seeking to have this action dismissed on the ground that it was immune from liability under Idaho Code \u00a7 46-1017. The district court granted that motion and dismissed this action. Inama then appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">II. ISSUES ON APPEAL</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-6\">A. Did the district court err in ruling that Idaho Code \u00a7 46-1017 granted immunity to Boise County for the loss of Inama\u2019s loader?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-7\">B. Did the district court err in ruling that neither the United States Constitution nor the Idaho Constitution required Boise County to compensate Inama for the loss of his loader?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-8\">C. Did the district court correctly rule that Boise County is not required to compensate Inama for the loss of his loader under the theory of conversion?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-9\">D. Is either party entitled to attorney fees on appeal?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-10\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b386-11\">In an appeal from an order of summary judgment, this Court\u2019s standard of review is the same as the standard used by the trial court in ruling on a motion for summary judgment. <em>Infanger v. City of Salmon, </em>137 Idaho 45, 44 P.3d 1100 (2002). All disputed facts are to be construed liberally in favor of the non-moving party, and all reasonable inferences that can be drawn from the record are to be drawn in favor of the non-moving party. <em>Id. </em>Summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings, depositions, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. <em>Id. </em>If the evidence reveals no disputed issues of material fact, then only a question of law remains, over which this Court exercises free review. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b386-15\">A. Did the District Court Err in Ruling that Idaho Code \u00a7 46-1017 Granted Immunity to Boise County for the Loss of Inama\u2019s Loader?</p>\n<p id=\"b386-16\">The district court held that Boise County was immune from liability in this case pursuant to Idaho Code \u00a7 46-1017,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> which is part of the Idaho Disaster Preparedness Act of 1975. IDAHO CODE \u00a7\u00a7 46-1001 <em>et seq. </em>(1997). Section 46-1017 was intended by the legislature to codify a version of the doctrine of public necessity. <em>Marty v. State, </em>117 Idaho 133, 786 P.2d 524 (1989). Insofar as is relevant in this case, the statute provides that no political subdivision of the state, \u201cengaged in any ... disaster relief activities, acting under a declaration by proper authority ... while complying or attempting to comply with this act ..., shall be liable for ... damage to property as a result of such activity.\u201d It is undisputed that Boise County is a subdivision of the state and that while using Inama\u2019s loader the County was engaged in disaster relief activities, was acting under a declaration of disaster emergency, and was complying or attempting to comply with the Idaho Disaster Preparedness Act of 1975. Inama does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>dispute those facts. He argues, however, that the scope of immunity granted by \u00a7 46-1017 is narrowed by Idaho Code \u00a7 46-1012.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">Inama bases his argument upon subsection (3) of the statute, which provides, \u201cCompensation for property shall be only if the property was commandeered or otherwise used in coping with a disaster emergency and its use or destruction was ordered by the governor or his representative.\u201d He argues that the scope of immunity provided by Idaho Code \u00a7 46-1017 should be no broader than the scope of compensation allowed under Idaho Code \u00a7 46-1012. Thus, he asserts that because the governor or his representative<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> did not order the use or destruction of the loader, he is not entitled to compensation under \u00a7 46-1012 and therefore the County should not have immunity under \u00a7 46-1017.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">The interpretation of a statute is a question of law over which we exercise free review. <em>Gooding County v. Wybenga, </em>137 Idaho 201, 46 P.3d 18 (2002). It must begin with the literal words of the statute, <em>Thomson v. City of Lewiston, </em>137 Idaho 473, 50 P.3d 488 (2002); those words must be given their plain, usual, and ordinary meaning; and the statute must be construed as a whole. <em>State v. Hart, </em>135 Idaho 827, 25 P.3d 850 (2001). If the statute is not ambiguous, this Court does not construe it, but simply follows the law as written. <em>Hansen v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>112 Idaho 663, 735 P.2d 974 (1987). Unless the result is palpably absurd, we must assume that the legislature means what is clearly stated in the statute. <em>Miller v. State, </em>110 Idaho 298, 715 P.2d 968 (1986). If the statute as written is socially or otherwise unsound, the power to correct it is legislative, not judicial. <em>Hansen v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>112 Idaho 663, 735 P.2d 974 (1987). A statute is ambiguous where the language is capable of more than one reasonable construction. <em>Jen-Rath Co., Inc. v. Kit Mfg. Co., </em>137 Idaho 330, 48 P.3d 659 (2002). Ambiguity is not established merely because differing interpretations are presented to the Court; otherwise, all statutes would be considered ambiguous. <em>Id. </em>If the statute is ambiguous, then it must be construed to mean what the legislature intended for it to mean. <em>Miller v. State, </em>110 Idaho 298, 715 P.2d 968 (1986). To determine that intent, we examine not only the literal words of the statute, but also the reasonableness of proposed constructions, the public policy behind the statute, and its legislative history. <em>Lopez v. State, Indus. Special Indem. Fund, </em>136 Idaho 174, 30 P.3d 952 (2001); <em>Adamson v. Blanchard, </em>133 Idaho 602, 990 P.2d 1213 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-12\">Idaho Code \u00a7 46-1012(3) is clear and unambiguous. Compensation for property damaged, lost, or destroyed can be recovered under the Idaho Disaster Preparedness Act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>of 1975 only if its use or destruction was ordered by the governor or his representative. Idaho Code \u00a7 46-1017 is likewise clear and unambiguous. The statute as written does not limit the scope of immunity to damages compensable under \u00a7 46-1012. Therefore, the District Court did not err in holding that Idaho Code \u00a7 46-1017 granted Boise County immunity from damages resulting from the loss of Inama\u2019s loader.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">B. Did the District Court Err in Ruling that neither the United States Constitution nor the Idaho Constitution Required Boise County to Compensate Inama for the Loss of His Loader?</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">In his brief, Inama lists as an assignment of error: \u201cWhether the District Court properly ruled as a matter of law, that Boise County was not obligated to compensate [Inama] for the loss of his front end loader pursuant to the United States and Idaho Constitutions.\u201d He presented no argument or authority, however, regarding the United States Constitution. In the argument portion of his brief, Inama only mentioned the United States Constitution once in passing. He quoted a portion of his argument to the district court, and that argument included the statement, \u201cWe probably do need to do some additional briefing on that, but, to me, this Idaho constitution, the 5th and 14th Amendments create an exception to the immunity.\u201d We will not consider issues cited on appeal that are not supported by argument and propositions of law. <em>Farnworth v. Ratliff, </em>134 Idaho 237, 999 P.2d 892 (2000); <em>Highland Enter., Inc. v. Barker, </em>133 Idaho 330, 986 P.2d 996 (1999) (a one-sentence statement that an award of punitive damages violates due process is hardly sufficient to constitute argument); <em>Idaho State Ins. Fund v. Van Tine, </em>132 Idaho 902, 980 P.2d 566 (1999) (assertion that a particular statutory construction would violate due process will not be considered where it is not supported by argument and authority). In his briefing, Inama expressly stated that he is not contending that Idaho Code \u00a7 46-1017 is unconstitutional. He did not present any argument or authority regarding the application of the United States Constitution to the facts in this case. Therefore, we will not consider that issue on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">With respect to the Idaho Constitution, Inama argues that he is entitled to compensation for inverse condemnation pursuant to Article I, \u00a7' 14, which provides, insofar as is relevant, as follows: \u201cPrivate property may be taken for public use, but not until a just compensation, to be as ascertained in the manner prescribed by law, shall be paid therefore.\u201d In <em>Marty v. State, </em>117 Idaho 133, 786 P.2d 524 (1989), this Court held that if Idaho Code \u00a7 46-1017 grants immunity from liability regarding a particular loss, then compensation for inverse condemnation cannot be awarded under Article I, \u00a7 14.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-7\">Whether the landowners are entitled to compensation for inverse condemnation will first depend on whether their property was permanently damaged____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-9\">In the event permanent damage is shown by the landowners, the immunity provisions of I.C. \u00a7 46-1017 must be applied. This immunity exists only when the state, its political subdivisions or other agencies were \u201cacting under a declaration by proper authority.\u201d Here, the board of county commissioners did not declare an emergency until June 12, 1984. The governor declared an emergency on June 14, 1984. The emergency declared by the county commissioners was for a period of seven days. I.C. \u00a7 46-1011(1). The emergency declared by the governor was for thirty days, unless extended by further declaration. I.C. \u00a7 46-1008(2). Whether the actions of the governmental agencies were immunized by I.C. \u00a7 46-1017 will depend on whether they were taken during these periods.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b388-10\">117 Idaho at 144, 786 P.2d at 535. Therefore, because Idaho Code \u00a7 46-1017 grants the County immunity in this case, Inama is not entitled to recover compensation for inverse condemnation. The district court did not err in dismissing that claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-11\">C. Did the District Court Correctly Rule that Boise County Is Not Required to Compensate Inama for the Loss of His Loader Under the Theory of Conversion?</p>\n<p id=\"b388-12\">Inama contends that Boise County is liable for damages under the tort of conver<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>sion. The scope of immunity granted by Idaho Code \u00a7 46-1017 is not limited to particular theories of tort liability. It states broadly, \u201cNeither the state nor any political subdivision thereof ... shall be hable for ... damage to property as a result of such activity.\u201d Boise County has immunity under the statute whether Inama\u2019s claim is characterized as inverse condemnation or conversion. Therefore, the district court did not err in dismissing Inama\u2019s claim for conversion.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">D. Is Either Party Entitled to Attorney Fees on Appeal?</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">Both parties request attorney fees on appeal pursuant to Idaho Code \u00a7 12-117(1), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-6\">12-117. Attorney\u2019s fees, witness fees and expenses awarded in certain instances. \u2014 (1) Unless otherwise provided by statute, in any administrative or civil judicial proceeding involving as adverse parties a state agency, a city, a county or other taxing district and a person, the court shall award the prevailing party reasonable attorney\u2019s fees, witness fees and reasonable expenses, if the court finds that the party against whom the judgment is rendered acted without a reasonable basis in fact or law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">Inama is not entitled to attorney fees because he is not the prevailing party. <em>Thomson v. City of Lewiston, </em>137 Idaho 473, 50 P.3d 488 (2002); IDAHO CODE \u00a7 12-117(1) (2002 Supp.). We decline to award attorney fees to Boise County because we do not find that Inama appealed without a reasonable basis in fact or law.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b389-9\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed. Costs, but not attorney fees, are awarded on appeal to Boise County.</p>\n<judges id=\"b389-10\">Chief Justice TROUT, and Justices SCHROEDER, KIDWELL and Justice Pro Tem SCHWARTZMAN concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b384-9\">.
