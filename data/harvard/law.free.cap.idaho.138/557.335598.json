Simplot Company, Inc. (\u201cSimplot\u201d) leased a building to Rycair, Inc. The building was destroyed by a fire during the lease period. Simplot sued Rycair, alleging negli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>gence with respect to the cause of the fire and breach of contract for failure to maintain fire insurance on the building. Rycair filed a motion for partial summary judgment on the breach of contract claims. The district court granted Rycair\u2019s motion. The case went to trial on the negligence claim and the jury determined that Rycair was not negligent with respect to the cause of the fire. The district court awarded attorney fees to Rycair. We affirm the summary judgment, but we vacate the district court\u2019s order awarding attorney fees to Rycair.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">Simplot and Rycair entered into a commercial lease whereby Rycair leased the premises on Irving Street in Boise, known as the Kaiser building. The lease was executed on September 1, 1995. On December 6, 1996, the Kaiser building was destroyed by fire. Simplot made a demand upon Rycair for the loss of the building, which Rycair\u2019s insurer refused to pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">Simplot filed suit on September 19, 1997, to recover its losses related to the destruction of the building, alleging breach of contract and negligence. Rycair filed a motion for partial summary judgment on the breach of contract claims, requesting that the district court find that Rycair was not required to purchase and keep in force first-party fire insurance on the braiding and that it was not required to indemnify Simplot for the property damage without proof of Rycair\u2019s negligence. The district court granted Rycair\u2019s motion and dismissed Simplot\u2019s remaining breach of contract claims against Rycair.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-8\">After obtaining permission from the court, Simplot filed an amended complaint. The complaint restated the breach of contract claims as well as additional breach of contract theories. The new contract theories alleged that Rycair was required to return the building in a condition equal to or better than at the commencement of the lease, that Simplot had suffered damages because Rycair had failed to obtain an insurance policy in which Simplot was designated as the insured and that Simplot was entitled to damages for Rycair\u2019s violation of the Uniform Building Code. Rycair filed a second motion for partial summary judgment with regard to the new breach of contract theories. The district court granted Rycair\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-10\">Rycair filed a third motion for summary judgment regarding the negligence claims. The district court heard argument and denied the motion. Six days before trial, a senior judge was assigned to preside over the jury trial. Four days before trial, Simplot filed a motion to reconsider the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. On the morning of trial, the senior judge denied the motion for reconsideration on the grounds that it was untimely and that he believed that Simplot was seeking to have another judge review the same arguments previously made to the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-11\">The jury trial began on September 24, 2001. At the conclusion of trial, the jury rendered a verdict that Rycair was not negligent. The district court awarded Rycair attorney fees and costs as a matter of right. No discretionary costs were awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-12\">Simplot appeals the district court\u2019s grant of Rycair\u2019s motions for partial summary judgment and the award of attorney fees. Rycair cross-appeals the district court\u2019s denial of certain costs that were not granted by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-13\">ISSUES PRESENTED ON APPEAL</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-14\">1.

Craney, </em>135 Idaho 166, 170, 16 P.3d 263, 267 (2000). All disputed facts are to be liberally construed in favor of the non-moving party, and all reasonable in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>ferences that can be drawn from the record are to be drawn in favor of the non-moving party. <em>Eagle Water Company, Inc. v. Roundy Pole Fence Company, Inc., </em>134 Idaho 626, 628, 7 P.3d 1103, 1105 (2000). Summary judgment is appropriate only when the pleadings, depositions, affidavits and admissions on file show that there is no genuine issue of material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. I.R.C.P. 56(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">1. Did the district court err in granting partial summary judgment to Rycair?</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">A. <em>Section 10 of the Lease</em></p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">Both parties asserted to the district court that the lease was unambiguous, however, Simplot contended that section 10(c) of the lease should require Rycair to purchase insurance to cover the budding.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Simplot argues that the district court erred by allowing extrinsic evidence concerning the meaning of the term \u201cfire legal insurance\u201d to be presented, given that the lease was unambiguous. Finally, Simplot avers that it should have been named as an additional insured on Rycair\u2019s insurance policy. Simplot contends that, had Simplot been named as an insured, it would not have incurred expenses for debris removal, independent adjuster fees and damages to the Kaiser building.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-16\">1. <em>First-Party Insurance</em></p>\n<p id=\"b618-17\">The district court agreed with the parties that the lease was unambiguous. The district court concluded that the insurance provision in Section 10 did not require Rycair to provide first-party fire insurance. The district court held that the term \u201cfire legal insurance\u201d was a term of art. The district court determined that fire legal in-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>surance \u201cis commonly required in leases to cover the costs of the deductible on the lessor\u2019s own insurance and to effect a waiver of subrogation by the lessor\u2019s insurer against the lessee in event a fire is caused by the tenant.\u201d The district court then decided that \u201c[t]he requirement of this type of fire legal protection coverage is consistent with the language of paragraphs 7 and 16 of the lease, which indicated that where the loss is caused by fire or any other matter not caused by the lessee, and insured by the lessor, lessor shall be required to make all of the necessary repairs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">Section 10(c) provides that Rycair was to have bodily injury and property damage insurance insuring Simplot and itself; such insurance shall contain fire legal protection with limits of at least $100,000. Section 7 required Simplot to make structural repairs to the Kaiser building provided such repairs are not made necessary by Rycair\u2019s negligence, misuse or abuse.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Section 16 of the lease provides that if the Kaiser building was destroyed by a fire that is not the result of Rycair\u2019s negligence, use, misuse or abuse, that the lease may be terminated or if the parties elect to continue with the lease that Simplot will restore and reconstruct the damaged building.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">Given that fire legal insurance covers the liability of Rycair for fire damage caused by its own negligence and that Sections 7 and 16 cover the Kaiser building if damaged by fire, the lease does not require Rycair to have first-party fire insurance for the Kaiser building. A fair reading of Section 10 of the lease shows that this section is for liability purposes and does not make the lessee an insurer or require first-party insurance coverage for fire damage to the building as argued by Simplot. The district court correctly determined that the lease provided there would be liability on the part of Rycair only if Rycair was negligent in causing the fire. The jury found that Rycair was not negligent in causing the fire, therefore, there is no requirement of insurance for liability on the part of Rycair.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-13\">This Court affirms the district court\u2019s determination that the lease was unambiguous and did not require Rycair to purchase first-party fire insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-14\">2. <em>Extrinsic Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b619-15\">The parol evidence rule provides \u201c[i]f the written agreement is complete upon its face and unambiguous, no fraud or mistake being alleged, extrinsic evidence of prior or contemporaneous negotiations or conversations is not admissible to contradict, vary, alter, add to or detract from the terms of the contract.\u201d <em>Belk v. Martin, </em>136 Idaho 652, 657, 39 P.3d 592, 597 (2001) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-16\">The district court determined that \u201c[u]se of a term of art does not necessarily render a contract provision ambiguous, and testimony concerning what the term means, in other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>words how it is ordinarily used, does not constitute a reference to parol evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">The evidence presented by Rycair was an affidavit from Richard Chipman, a former commercial and property insurance underwriter. In his affidavit, Mr. Chipman stated that \u201c \u2018[f]ire legal protection\u2019 or \u2018fire legal liability\u2019 provides some additional protection to the insured under certain circumstances. If an insured is leasing his business facility from another person, and the insured were to negligently cause a fire which damaged the leased premises, \u2018fire legal protection\u2019 would provide coverage for the damage to the leased premises up to the insured\u2019s policy limit for \u2018fire legal coverage.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">Simplot alleges that the term \u201cfire legal insurance\u201d was not raised until Rycair\u2019s rebuttal argument at the first summary judgment hearing and therefore it did not have an adequate opportunity to dispute it. However, Mr. Chipman\u2019s affidavit was filed on the same day as Rycair\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment. It is clear that Simplot was put on notice of Rycair\u2019s theory and had the opportunity to dispute the term.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">The evidence presented by Rycair sought to define the lease term \u201cfire legal protection\u201d as used by the insurance industry. Rycair\u2019s evidence did not seek \u201cto contradict, vary, alter, add to or detract from the terms of the contract\u201d nor was the evidence \u201cprior or contemporaneous negotiations or conversations\u201d between the parties. <em>See id. </em>Simplot has not contended that the term \u201cfire legal <em>protection\u201d is </em>other than a term of art.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">The district court correctly concluded that the term \u201cfire legal protection\u201d was a term of art within the insurance industry. The court relied upon Mr. Chipman\u2019s affidavit to reach this conclusion. Further, in determining the meaning of \u201cfire legal insurance,\u201d the district court not only considered the affidavit presented by Rycair but also cited to a Practicing Law Institute Publication and a Pennsylvania case.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-11\">\u201cParol evidence, of course, may be received to interpret a term of art used within a contract.\u201d <em>In re Marriage of Shaban, </em>88 Cal.App.4th 398, 105 Cal.Rptr.2d 863, 867 (2001). Extrinsic evidence, such as expert testimony and learned treatises, may also be helpful to understand and give meaning to terms of art, but such evidence should be received at the discretion of the court and is not controlling. <em>McNulty v. Taser Int\u2019l Inc., </em>217 F.Supp.2d 1058, 1062 (C.D.Cal.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-12\">We conclude that the parol evidence rule was not a bar to the evidence being admissible before the district court. This Court holds that the district court did not err in determining the plain meaning of the lease term requiring \u201cfire legal protection.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b620-13\">3. <em>Named Party</em></p>\n<p id=\"b620-14\">According to section 10(c) of the lease, Rycair should have had property damage insurance, which insured both Simplot and itself and contained fire legal protection with limits of at least $100,000. Given this fact, Rycair should have named Simplot in its policy. However, the fire legal protection required by the lease only would have compensated Simplot for the Kaiser building had Rycair been negligent. The jury determined that Rycair was not negligent, therefore, Simplot has suffered no damages by not being named as an insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-15\">This Court holds that the district court did not err in finding that Simplot did not suffer any damages by not being named in Rycair\u2019s insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-16\">B. <em>Section 5 of the Lease</em></p>\n<p id=\"b620-17\">Simplot contends that Rycair did not submit an argument based on Section 5 and, therefore, the district court should not have entered judgment in Rycair\u2019s favor based upon this section.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Simplot alleges that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>section is not limited to indemnity but requires Rycair to protect and save Simplot and thus requires Rycair to pay for Simplot\u2019s losses relating to the Kaiser building. In response, Rycair argues that the lease does not require it to pay Simplot damages, unless Simplot proves Rycair\u2019s negligence, which Simplot failed to do at the jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">The district court found that the \u201cprotect, save and keep Lessor harmless\u201d language of Section 5 only applies to claims made against Simplot by third parties for personal injury or property damages arising out of Ryeair\u2019s use of the property. The district court further pointed out that \u201cthe parties made specific provisions concerning damage to and/or destruction of the building, including who would be responsible for such loss and under what circumstances, in paragraphs 7 and 16. These provisions make it clear that Rycair is responsible for payment of such losses only if they are due to Rycair\u2019s negligence.\u201d The district court found that Section 5\u2019s broad reference to indemnification would not govern over the more specific provisions contained in Sections 7 and 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">The lease contains specific provisions that govern in the case of destruction of the property. Section 5\u2019s language of \u201cprotect, save and keep Lessor harmless\u201d does not shift the risk of loss to Rycair. Rather, the language appears to protect Simplot from third party claims that arise from Ryeair\u2019s negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-11\">Although discussed in the context of returning property to the same condition as at the beginning of the lease, the Texas Supreme Court has stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-12\">\u2018Looking to the terms and subject matter of the contract, we do not think it reasonable or fair to conclude that the parties contemplated that the lessees were to become insurers of the property against those casualties which ordinary prudence and foresight could not have guarded against; or that it was supposed or intended that they were to become liable to repair the loss in case of accidental destruction of the property by fire without negligence of fault on their part____ It would have been a very extraordinary liability for the lessee to assume; and, if intended, it would doubtless have been clearly expressed in the lease.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b621-15\"><em>Ovr v. Vandygriff, </em>251 S.W.2d 573, 574 (1952) (quoting <em>Howeth v. Anderson, </em>25 Tex. 557 (1860)).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-16\">This Court holds that the district court correctly considered and applied Section 5 in determining whether Rycair was liable to Simplot for its damages. The decision of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-17\">C. <em>Section 6 of the Lease</em></p>\n<p id=\"b621-18\">Simplot contends that Section 6 of the lease requires Rycair to return the premises to the condition equal to or better than it was at the commencement of the lease.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> There<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>fore, Simplot asserts that Rycair should pay for the destruction of the building. Rycair replies that this request would require it to be an absolute insurer of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">The district court found that Section 6 related to issues other than loss by fire and that Section 7 specifically governs the fire scenario. The district court determined that because the more specific provision of a contract governs over the more general provision, Section 7 applies to the loss of the Kaiser building.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">The general rule appears to be that normal wear and tear lease requirements do not include fire damage to the property. \u201cThe plain meaning of maintain or repair is not synonymous with rebuild. \u2018Repair\u2019 means to amend, not to make a new thing. What controls in a lease is the intent of the parties at the time of execution, and the plain meaning of the language used. The obligation of the lessee will not be extended beyond the plain meaning of the language used, and if there is not an express stipulation requiring the lessee to rebuild the properties destroyed without fault, the loss will fall on the landlord.\u201d 49 Am.Jur.2d, <em>Landlord and Tenant, </em>\u00a7 859 (2001) (citations omitted).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-6\">The general agreement to surrender the premises, at the expiration of a term, in as good condition as they may have been at the beginning of or during the term must be construed with the other covenants in the lease prescribing the liability of the lessees in the event of damages to the premises. It follows that the agreements to keep the premises in good repair, and, at the end of the term, to surrender them in as good condition as they were at the beginning of or during the term are not, and do not include, a covenant to replace a structure totally destroyed by fire without fault of the tenant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-7\"><em>Realty &amp; Rebuilding Co. v. Rea, </em>184 Cal. 565, 194 P. 1024 (Cal.1920).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-8\">One Idaho case appears to address this situation. <em>See Porter v. Allen, 8 </em>Idaho 358, 69 P. 105 (1902). In <em>Porter, </em>the risk of loss of a rented mill that was destroyed by fire was placed upon the lessee. However, it was determined that the fire was caused by the lessee\u2019s negligence. This is not the case here, because the jury determined that Rycair was not negligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-11\">This Court affirms the district court\u2019s decision and holds that Rycair was not required to rebuild the building under Section 6 of the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-12\">2. Did the district court err in awarding attorney fees to Rycair?</p>\n<p id=\"b622-13\">Simplot contends that the district court erred in awarding the portion of attorney fees to Rycair related to the negligence claim. Rycair points out that Simplot\u2019s allegations and action in this case were based upon the lease and thus the defense presented by Rycair was based upon the lease. Therefore, Rycair asserts that it was proper for the district court to award attorney fees pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 12-120(3). Even if the award under I.C. \u00a7 12-120(3) was improper, Rycair contends that the lease provides for attorney fees in defending these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-14\">Idaho Code \u00a7 12-120(3) allows for the recovery of attorney fees by the prevailing party in a civil action to recover on any commercial transaction. The term \u201ccommercial transaction,\u201d as defined by I.C. \u00a7 12-120(3), includes all transactions except transactions for personal or household purposes. This Court has previously held that \u201c \u2018[attorney fees are not appropriate under I.C. \u00a7 12-120(3) unless the commercial transaction is integral to the claim, and constitutes the basis upon which the party is attempting to recover.\u2019 \u201d <em>C &amp; G, Inc. v. Rule, </em>135 Idaho 763, 769, 25 P.3d 76, 82 (2001) (quoting <em>Brower v. E.I. DuPont De Nemours &amp; Co., </em>117 Idaho 780, 784, 792 P.2d 345, 349 (1990)).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-15\">This Court has previously held \u201cwhere there is a valid contract between the parties which contains a provision for an award of attorney fees and costs, the terms of that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>contractual provision establish a right to an award of attorney fees and costs.\u201d <em>Lease-First v. Burns, </em>131 Idaho 158, 163, 953 P.2d 598, 603 (1998) (quoting <em>Farm Credit Bank v. Wissel, </em>122 Idaho 565, 568-69, 836 P.2d 511, 514-15 (1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">Here the lease between Simplot and Rycair provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-6\">22. Attorney Fees and Costs. In the event that either party to the Lease utilizes an attorney to enforce any of the provision hereof, the unsuccessful party agrees to pay the prevailing party all costs and expenses, including reasonable attorney\u2019s fees incurred thereon by the prevailing party, and such may be included in the judgment entered in such action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AdZf\">The district court found that the lease the parties entered into was for commercial use and therefore constituted a \u201ccommercial transaction\u201d for purposes of I.C. \u00a7 12-120(3). The district court further determined that Simplot\u2019s \u201ccontinuous references to the contract and attempts to inject contract claims or issues into the negligence claim ... shows that the commercial transaction was the basis upon which Simplot attempted to recover.\u201d The district court discussed the twelve factors listed in I.R.C.P. 54(e)(3) and awarded a majority of the requested attorney fees to Rycair.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-9\">Both I.C. \u00a7 12-120(3) and the lease agreement provide for the award to the prevailing party of attorney fees incurred. In this case, the commercial lease is integral to the contract claims and served as one of the theories upon which Simplot sought to recover. Attorney fees could be properly awarded by the district court under the lease and I.C. \u00a7 12-120(3) for claims relating to the lease. However, the lease and I.C. \u00a7 12-120(3) do not provide for fees on the claims relating to the negligence cause of action. Therefore, Rycair should not be awarded attorney fees for defending at trial the tort claim concerning negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-10\">This Court sets aside the district court\u2019s award of attorney fees and remands the case to the district court to recalculate the award of fees. The district court should allocate the attorney fees incurred by Rycair in defending against the breach of contract claims but not include fees incurred in defending the count of the complaint that went to trial before the jury on the negligence cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-13\">3. Were Rycair\u2019s costs properly calculated by the district court?</p>\n<p id=\"b623-14\">The district court denied a portion of costs requested by Rycair finding that they were \u201cdiscretionary\u201d costs under I.R.C.P. 54(d)(1)(D). The costs in question were costs relating to expert witness and expedited deposition transcripts. The district court found that Rycair failed to show that the \u201cuse of expert testimony on the cause of the fire and value of the property were exceptional costs that should be assessed against Simplot\u201d and that Rycair failed to show \u201cthe additional charges for expediting the transcripts was necessary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b623-15\">Section 22 of the lease provides \u201cthe unsuccessful party agrees to pay the prevailing party <em>all </em>costs and expenses.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The costs of the deposition were incurred in connection to the negligence cause of action and therefore are not covered under the lease provision concerning costs. The determination of whether to award costs was left solely to the discretion of the district court. There has been no showing that the district court abused this discretion in denying the award of these costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-16\">Therefore, this Court holds that the district court did not err in denying certain costs to Rycair as discretionary.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-17\">4. Are either of the parties entitled to attorney fees on appeal?</p>\n<p id=\"b623-18\">Both parties request attorney fees on appeal. This Court has interpreted I.C. \u00a7 12-120(3) to mandate an award of attorney fees on appeal as well as at trial. <em>Eagle Water Co., Inc. v. Roundy Pole Fence Co., Inc., </em>134 Idaho 626, 629, 7 P.3d 1103, 1106 (2000). Both I.C. \u00a7 12-120(3) and the lease provide for the award of attorney fees to the prevailing party on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-19\">Because both parties in this case have prevailed in part, this Court will not award <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>attorney fees on appeal and will require both parties to bear their own costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">This Court affirms the district court\u2019s grant of partial summary judgment to Rycair. The district court\u2019s award of attorney fees to Ryeair is set aside and remanded to the district court for further action consistent with this opinion.
