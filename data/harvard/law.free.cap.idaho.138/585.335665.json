We vacate the order dismissing the appeal and remand this case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-15\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b644-16\">On July 25, 2000, Vern Caven, d/b/a Ace Septic, submitted a conditional use permit application to the Bonner County Planning and Zoning Commission. He sought to store and apply septic tank sludge on eighty acres of real property owned by Lois Jennen located approximately five miles north of the city of Sandpoint. Residents living in the vicinity of Jennen\u2019s real property formed a non-profit association called County Residents Against Pollution from Septage Sludge. After public hearings, the Planning and Zoning Commission approved the conditional use permit on October 25,2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-17\">On November 9, 2000, the Plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal with the Bonner County Board of Commissioners (\u201cCounty Commissioners\u201d), and on December 7, 2000, the Commissioners summarily dismissed the appeal \u201cfor failure to state lawful grounds upon which the appeal can be based.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b644-18\">On January 3, 2001, the Plaintiffs filed a petition for judicial review. On April 18, 2001, they filed a motion for summary judgment seeking to have this case remanded to the County Commissioners on the ground that they unlawfully dismissed the appeal from the Planning and Zoning Commission. Bonner County objected on the ground that a motion for summary judgment was not appropriate in a petition for judicial review and that there was no showing that the Commissioners abused their discretion in dismissing the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-19\">The motion for summary judgment was heard on July 11, 2001. Eight days later, the district court entered its order granting the motion. The district court ordered that the case be remanded back to the County Commissioners for a public hearing as provided by county ordinance. The district court later <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>awarded the Plaintiffs costs and attorney fees totaling $4,439.50. Bonner County timely filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-4\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">A person aggrieved by a planning and zoning decision may seek judicial review of that decision under the Idaho Administrative Procedures Act (IAPA). Idaho Code \u00a7 67-6521(d) (2001). On an appeal from a decision of a district court acting in its appellate capacity under the IAPA this Court reviews the agency record independently of the district court\u2019s decision. <em>Sanders Orchard v. Gem County ex rel. Bd. of County Comm\u2019rs, </em>137 Idaho 695, 52 P.3d 840 (2002). The Board\u2019s zoning decision may be overturned only where it: (a) violates statutory or constitutional provisions; (b) exceeds the agency\u2019s statutory authority; (c) was made upon unlawful procedure; (d) is not supported by substantial evidence in the record as a whole; or (e) is arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion. <em>Id.; </em>Idaho Code \u00a7 67-5279(3) (2001). In addition, the Board\u2019s zoning decision must be upheld if substantial rights of the appellant have not been prejudiced. <em>Sanders Orchard v. Gem County ex rel. Bd. of County Comm\u2019rs, </em>137 Idaho 695, 52 P.3d 840 (2002); Idaho Code \u00a7 67-5279(4) (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">Bonner County argues that the district court erred in considering the Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment because it was not supported by affidavits or a sworn complaint and Bonner County did not have an opportunity to submit affidavits in opposition to the motion. Generally, summary judgment is not the appropriate procedure for resolving a petition for judicial review. The district court is not permitted to receive evidence on appeal except in two limited circumstances,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> neither of which applies in this case. Plaintiffs\u2019 petition for judicial review should have been heard simply as an appellate proceeding, with oral argument, as provided in Rule 84 of the Idaho Rules of Civil Procedure. The district court\u2019s action in deciding this appeal upon Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment, however, did not prejudice Bonner County. The issue upon which Plaintiffs\u2019 petition for judicial review was based was clearly presented in their motion for summary judgment, Bonner County filed a written response to the motion, and both parties presented oral argument to the district court regarding the issues raised by the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-8\">Pursuant to the authority granted by the Local Land Use Planning Act, Idaho Code \u00a7\u00a7 67-6501 <em>et seq. </em>(2001), the County Commissioners created the Bonner County Planning and Zoning Commission. The County Commissioners also adopted an ordinance providing for appeals to it from a final decision of the Planning and Zoning Commission. That ordinance gave the County Commissioners two options in considering an appeal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The first option authorized them to summarily dismiss the \u00e1ppeal \u201cfor failure to state lawful grounds upon which the appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>can be based.\u201d The second option required them to \u201c[e]onduct a public hearing on its own to gather additional information concerning the [appeal] request.\u201d If the County Commissioners did not select either option within thirty days of receipt of the request for appeal and notify the appellant in writing of its choice, then they were required to conduct the public hearing as required in the second option.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">In this case, the County Commissioners conducted a facial review of the notice of appeal and concluded that it did not state lawful grounds upon which the appeal could be based. They therefore summarily dismissed the appeal. The written notice of the dismissal stated: \u201cThe County Commissioners at the December 7, 2000, Business Meeting dismissed the referenced presentation of appeal for failure to state lawful grounds upon which the appeal can be based. This was done by a facial review of the submitted appeal. (BCRC, Section 12-451[d]).\u201d The County Commissioners did not specify what was lacking in the notice of appeal in order for it to state grounds upon which the appeal could be based. Likewise, in response to questions from this Court during oral argument, Bonner County was unable to state what was lacking in the notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">From our review of the notice of appeal, it clearly stated lawful grounds upon which an appeal could be based. The ordinance specifies the grounds for an appeal as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-6\">The grounds for appeals and the standard of review to be exercised by the Board of County Commissioners shall be that the Planning and Zoning Commission findings, conclusions and decision were:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-7\">(1) In violation of constitutional or statutory provisions;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-8\">(2) In excess of the statutory authority of the Commission;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-9\">(3) Made upon unlawful procedure;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-12\">(4) Arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-13\">(5) Not supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b646-14\">The notice of appeal filed by the Plaintiffs stated, \u201cThe following grounds of appeal are invoked and it is alleged the Planning and Zoning Commission findings, conclusions and decisions were: 1. Arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion; and 2. Not supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole.\u201d The notice of appeal then listed fifteen specific factual allegations supporting these grounds for appeal. Those factual allegations were single spaced and covered two and one-half pages. They were clearly sufficient to allege lawful grounds for an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-15\">Bonner County argues that under its ordinance, the County Commissioners can simply dismiss an appeal if they do not want to hear it. That is not what the ordinance states, however. Under the ordinance an appeal can be summarily dismissed only if the notice of appeal does not state on its face lawful grounds for an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-16\">Bonner County also argues that Plaintiffs\u2019 substantial rights have not been prejudiced by the dismissal of their appeal. It contends that the district court could simply have heard the appeal based upon the record of the proceedings before the Planning and Zoning Commission. Under the ordinance, if the notice of appeal states lawful grounds upon which an appeal can be based, the County Commissioners must conduct a public hearing to obtain additional information. The ordinance provides that at that hearing the Board of County Commissioners \u201cshall decide the matter in the same manner it would as if initial jurisdiction to hear such matters were vested in the Board.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, the summary dismissal deprived the Plaintiffs of their right, under the ordinance, to a public hearing at which additional information could be presented, after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>which the County Commissioners must decide the matter as if it were originally presented to them. The summary dismissal of their appeal clearly prejudiced the Plaintiffs\u2019 substantial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-4\">The district court awarded the Plaintiffs attorney fees, pursuant to Idaho Code \u00a7 12-117(1), in the sum of $3,812.50. That statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-5\">Unless otherwise provided by statute, in any administrative or civil judicial proceeding involving as adverse parties a state agency, a city, a county or other taxing district and a person, the court shall award the prevailing party reasonable attorney\u2019s fees, witness fees and reasonable expenses, if the court finds that the party against whom the judgment is rendered acted without a reasonable basis in fact or law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">Bonner County argues that it acted with a reasonable basis in fact or law because it simply followed its ordinance. As shown above, however, it clearly did not. It simply arbitrarily dismissed Plaintiffs\u2019 appeal with no basis under the ordinance for doing so. When it did so, Bonner County acted without a reasonable basis in fact or law. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s award of attorney fees to the Plaintiffs, and we grant their request for an additional award of attorney fees on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b647-8\">The order of the County Commissioners is vacated and this matter is remanded for further proceedings. We affirm the district court\u2019s award of attorney fees to the Plaintiffs, and we award them costs, including attorney fees, on appeal.</p>\n<judges id=\"b647-9\">Chief Justice TROUT, and Justices SCHROEDER, WALTERS and KIDWELL concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b645-9\">.
