(Pacific) and its surety, Liberty Mutual Insurance Company (Liberty), appeal from a decision of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>the Idaho Industrial Commission (the Commission).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">On October 18, 2000, Wayne Seward (Seward) fell off a ladder and injured his back in the course and scope of his employment with Pacific. At Pacific\u2019s request, Seward saw Dr. Hill.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">Dr. Hill referred Seward to Dr. Doerr, an orthopedic surgeon. Dr. Doerr ordered two MRIs for Seward. Neither MRI showed structural damage to Seward\u2019s back. Therefore, Dr. Doerr referred Seward to Dr. Cox, a physiatrist.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-8\">Dr. Cox noted that Seward had high \u201cWaddell\u2019s findings\u201d \u2014 symptoms for which no physiological basis exists. Consequently, Dr. Cox referred Seward to Dr. Calhoun, a psychologist. Dr. Calhoun found that no further medical treatment would help Seward unless he overcame his unfounded fears of pain and permanent injury. Thereafter, Seward returned to Dr. Cox. On March 13, 2001, Dr. Cox concluded that Seward had reached maximum medical improvement, needed no further care, and could return to work without limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-9\">On January 15, 2001, Seward had filed a worker\u2019s compensation claim and served the claim upon Pacific and Liberty. Pacific admitted <em>liability for, and </em>paid, Seward temporary total disability (TTD) of $456.90 and medical expenses of $1,073.00 before his claim was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-10\">In April 2001, without a referral, Seward saw Dr. Garber, an orthopedic surgeon. Dr. Garber treated Seward until July 5, 2001. The treatments included three epidural injections. On April 25, 2001, Dr. Garber began written correspondence with Liberty regarding Seward\u2019s condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-11\">At a hearing held on August 21, 2001, the parties disputed liability for the expenses Seward incurred in seeking treatment from Dr. Garber between April 9 and July 5, 2001, and whether Pacific owed Seward additional TTD benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-12\">The Commission found for Seward regarding the expenses Seward incurred seeing Dr. Garber. In doing so, the Commission cited <em>Quintero v. Pillsbury </em>for the proposition that all I.C. \u00a7 72-432(4) \u201crequires is that the employee must first give the employer the opportunity to authorize the change in physicians and if that request is denied then the employee can petition the Commission.\u201d 119 Idaho 918, 921, 811 P.2d 843, 846 (1991). The Commission held that in bringing a worker\u2019s compensation claim, Seward had appropriately \u201cpetitioned\u201d pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 72-432(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-13\">Pacific moved for reconsideration on the ground that the Commission\u2019s reliance on <em>Quintero </em>was misplaced and that the claimant failed to follow I.C. \u00a7 72-432(4) and Judicial Rule of Procedure (J.R.P.) XX(E). In its order on reconsideration, the Commission found that <em>\u201cQuintero </em>provides useful direction for the ease at hand pointing out that a claimant is not required to maintain a strict chain of referral among various treating physicians in order for the treatment to be compensible.\u201d The Commission also found Seward \u201ceffectively petitioned the Commission by taking the case to hearing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b568-14\">Pacific appealed the Commission\u2019s decision on the grounds that Seward failed to notify Pacific or Liberty of his request for a change of physician in accord with I.C. \u00a7 72-432(4) and J.R.P. XX.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-15\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-16\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b568-17\">This Court freely reviews the Commission\u2019s conclusions of law. <em>Hamilton ex rel. Hamilton v. Reeder Flying Servs., </em>135 Idaho 568, 569, 21 P.3d 890, 893 (2001) (citing <em>Taylor v. Soran Rest, Inc., </em>131 Idaho 525, 527, 960 P.2d 1254, 1256 (1998)).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-18\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-19\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b568-20\">Pacific and Liberty argue that the 1997 amendments to I.C. \u00a7 72-432 require that an employee give <em>written </em>notice <em>prior </em>to visiting a physician outside of the chain of referral. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>They contend the amendments also super-cede this Court\u2019s holdings in <em>Quintero. </em>Seward, on the other hand, asserts that Pacific and Liberty had knowledge of Seward\u2019s request for a change of physician sufficient to satisfy the requirements of I.C. \u00a7 72-432(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">We Affirm The Commission\u2019s Finding That Pacific And Liberty Are Liable For Dr. Garber\u2019s Treatment Of Seward.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">1. The Commission correctly interpreted I.C. \u00a7 72-432(4) and J.R.P. XX.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">Statutory interpretation begins with \u201cthe literal words of the statute, and this language should be given its plain, obvious, and rational meaning.\u201d <em>Jen-Rath Co. v. Kit Mfg. Co., </em>137 Idaho 330, 335, 48 P.3d 659, 664 (2002) (quoting <em>Williamson v. City of McCall (In re Williamson), </em>135 Idaho 452, 455, 19 P.3d 766, 769 (2001)).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">In 1997, the legislature amended I.C. \u00a7 72-432. Prior to the amendment, the section stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-8\">The employee upon reasonable grounds, may petition the commission for a change of physician to be provided by the employer, however, the employee must give notice to the employer or surety of his request for a change of physicians to afford the employer the opportunity to fulfill his obligations under this section. If proper notice is not given, the employer shall not be obligated to pay for the services obtained. Nothing in this section shall limit the attending physician from arranging for consultation, referral or specialized care without permission of the employer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b569-9\">I.C. \u00a7 72-432(4) (1996). In 1997, the legislature amended I.C. \u00a7 72-432(4) and added the language now found in I.C. \u00a7 72-432(5). These sections presently state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-10\">(4)(a) The employee upon reasonable grounds, may petition the commission for a change of physician to be provided by the employer; however, the employee must give written notice to the employer or surety of the employee\u2019s request for a change of physicians to afford the employer the opportunity to fulfill its obligations under this section. If proper notice is not given, the employer shall not be obligated to pay for the services obtained. Nothing in this section shall limit the' attending physician from arranging for consultation, referral or specialized care without permission of the employer. Upon receiving such written notice, the employer shall render its written decision on the claimant\u2019s request within fourteen (14) days. If any dispute arises over the issue of a request for change of physician, the industrial commission shall conduct an expedited hearing to determine whether or not the request for change of physician should be granted, and shall render a decision within fourteen (14) days after the filing of the response by the employer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-12\">(b) The industrial commission shall, no later than December 31, 1997, promulgate a rule for the expeditious handling of a petition for change of physician pursuant to this section. Nothing herein shall prevent the commission from making periodic amendments, as may become necessary, to any rule for a petition for change of physician.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b569-13\">The amendments to I.C. \u00a7 72-432(4) achieve the following: (1) require written notice to an employer or surety prior to petitioning the commission for a change of physician; (2) provide for an expedited hearing and decision; and (3) direct the Commission to promulgate rules for handling of petitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-14\">In accord with I.C. \u00a7 72-432(4)(b), the Commission promulgated J.R.P. XX. Under this rule, \u201cnotice\u201d and \u201cpetition\u201d are used synonymously. J.R.P. XX(A)(1). Rule XX(E) requires that a petition contain the names and addresses of the employee, employer, surety (if known), current physician, and prospective physician. J.R.P. XX(E)(l)(a)-(i). A petition should also state general information regarding the injury or disease, summary of medical treatment, reason for request, and available hearing dates within thirty days. The information \u201cshall be in writing and submitted in a format substantially similar to the form provided in Rule XX, Form A.\u201d While J.R.P. XX(E) provides specific requirements for petitions, J.R.P. XX(I) states: \u201cThe above procedure <em>shall not be deemed exclusive. </em>An employee may pursue a change of physician through the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>application for hearing process described in Idaho Code \u00a7 72-706.\u201d J.R.P. XX(I). The \u201cclaim for compensation\u201d required by I.C. \u00a7 72-706 may serve as the pre-petition notice required by I.C. \u00a7 72-432. The Commission acted within its power in promulgating J.R.P. XX(I) because the procedures of I.C. \u00a7 72-706 \u201cafford the employer the opportunity to fulfill its obligations under [section 72-432]\u201d prior to the Commission taking any action.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">Seward\u2019s claim for medical expenses incurred seeking care from Dr. Garber is a \u201cclaim\u201d for purposes of I.C. \u00a7 72-706(1). The record shows that Seward\u2019s claim was made in writing and that it was served on both the employer and surety. While the claim was filed prior to Seward\u2019s visits to Dr. Garber, Liberty became aware of the care rendered by Dr. Garber through written correspondence with Dr. Garber prior to the hearing on Seward\u2019s claim. The knowledge that Seward sought treatment from Dr. Garber, in combination with the claim, granted Pacific and Liberty the opportunity to meet their obligations to pay expenses Seward incurred seeking treatment from Dr. Garber. Based on these and other facts in .the record, the Commission found that Seward effectively petitioned the Commission for a change of physician. The appellants do not challenge the Commission\u2019s findings of fact on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">Because the Commission properly applied I.C. \u00a7 72-432(4) and J.R.P. XX, and its findings of facts are not challenged on appeal, we affirm the Commission\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">2. Neither I.C \u00a7 72-432(4) nor J.R.P. XX supercede the core holdings of <em>Quintero.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b570-9\">This Court assumes that the Legislature knew of existing precedent at the time it passed or amended a statute. <em>See State v. Burnight, </em>132 Idaho 654, 659, 978 P.2d 214, 219 (1999) (citing <em>City of Sandpoint v. Sandpoint Indep. Highway Dist., </em>126 Idaho 145, 150, 879 P.2d 1078, 1083 (1994)). When a statute is amended, however, \u201cit is presumed that the legislature intended the statute to have a meaning different from the meaning accorded the statute before amendment.\u201d <em>Miller v. State, </em>110 Idaho 298, 299, 715 P.2d 968, 969 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-10\">In <em>Quintero, </em>this Court applied the pre1997 version of I.C. \u00a7 72-432(4), and J.R.P. XX was not promulgated. Inasmuch as <em>Quintero </em>stands for the proposition that I.C. \u00a7 72-432(4) does not require written notice, the 1997 amendment to I.C. \u00a7 72-432(4) supercedes it. Neither the 1997 amendments to I.C. \u00a7 72-432, nor J.R.P. XX, address the key holdings of <em>Quintero: </em>(1) lack of a referral is not fatal to an employee\u2019s claim for compensation, or reimbursement for, medical services; and (2) nothing in I.C. \u00a7 72-432 prohibits a post-treatment petition for a change of physician. 119 Idaho at 921-22, 811 P.2d at 846-47. Since neither the post<em>Q\u00faintero </em>amendments to I.C. \u00a7 72-432 or J.R.P. XX address the holdings of <em>Quintero, </em>neither wholly supercede it.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-11\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-12\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b570-13\">The Commission has properly applied I.C. \u00a7 72-432 and promulgated J.R.P. XX. Neither the 1997 amendments to I.C. \u00a7 72-432, nor the promulgation of J.R.P. XX, super-cede <em>Quintero. </em>Therefore, we affirm the Commission\u2019s decision. Costs are awarded to the respondent. No attorney fees were requested on appeal.</p>\n<judges id=\"b570-14\">Chief Justice TROUT and Justices SCHROEDER, WALTERS, and EISMANN concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
