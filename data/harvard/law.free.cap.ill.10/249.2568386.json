Steelman then filed with the Clerk a special-demurrer to the declaration. At the October term, 1848,\u2022 the Hon. Norman H. Purple presiding, when the cause was called for trial, one of the defendants\u2019 counsel stated in substance, that he believed they w.ould have nothing further to do with the case. A jury was then called .to assess the plaintiffs\u2019 damages in open Court. While the jury was being called, another of the defendants\u2019 counsel came into Court and without consultation with the former, proceeded to put questions to the witness or witnesses, both counsel being in Court. The jury assessed the plaintiffs\u2019 damages at $814\"20, upon which the Court rendered a judgment in the usual form in cases of attachment.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b266-5\" pgmap=\"266\">T.

Usher, Bre. 14.</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b266-11\" pgmap=\"266(58) 267(113)\">Our statute places this case of judgment by nil dicit on the same footing as if the judgment had be.en rendered,under a verdict. If, in this case, the party had put in the general issue, or had gone to trial without any plea filed, the demurrer would have b.een waived, and he .could .not, .as we .haye seen, have assigned this for error. It is the fault of the party that the demurrer was not acted on, and his appearing at the calling the cause for trial, and saying nothing in bar of the action, was a virtual waiver of the demurrer, and was calculated to lull the other party into security, and he is thus not entitled to the interference of the Court. This Court has already treated similar cases as cured by the statute. Rev. Stat. 49, \u00a7 6; ib. 51, \u00a7 11; Brazzle v. Usher, Bre. 14; Peltier v. Britton, 4 Blackf. 502; Johnson v.
