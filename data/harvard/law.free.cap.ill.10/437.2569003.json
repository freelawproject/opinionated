The plaintiffs appealed to the Circuit Court, and the cause was heard before the Hon. Theophilus L. Dickey at the February special term, 1849, without the intervention of a jury, when a judgment was rendered in favor of the plaintiffs for $59-03, damages.</summary><summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b454-5\" pgmap=\"454\">The evidence in the cause was embodied in a bill of exceptions, and was substantially as follows:</summary><summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b454-6\" pgmap=\"454\">Jacob Metzker, called by the plaintiffs, testified that some time in the spring or summer of 1847, he was in conversation with Walrath, negotiating a settlement of some dispute between them, when Walrath stated that he paid his attorneys out of the store of Norton &amp; Blackstone, and that he, Walrath, had to pay the latter in cash. He could not recollect the precise time of this transaction, but thought it was during the latter part of June, or the first of July.</summary><summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b454-7\" pgmap=\"454\">John M. Crothers, also called by the plaintiffs, testified that some time early in the spring of 1847, Walrath, for Norton &amp; Blackstone, placed in the hands of witness and his partner certain accounts for collection, one of about $300 against the defendant, another of $27-71 against A. R. Dodge, and a third for $31-32 against S. W. Randall; that Walrath at the time told witness that he supposed he would have to pay the two last mentioned accounts, as he owed them for professional services, and requested witness not to sue them immediately; that some time afterwards, from one to three months as witness supposes, not recollecting the precise time, Walrath exhibited to witness and his partner a writing from Norton &amp; Blackstone, the same read in evidence on the trial,' which was in the words and figures following, to wit:</summary><summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b454-8\" pgmap=\"454\">\u201cMessrs Crothers &amp; Pitzer,</summary><summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b454-9\" pgmap=\"454\">Gent\u2019n.</summary><summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b454-10\" pgmap=\"454\">Mr Walrath has paid us eighty dollars on yr acc\u2019t.

R. Dodge, another of plaintiffs\u2019 witnesses, testified that he traded in the store of Norton &amp; Blackstone to the amount of about $27*71, and that Walrath told him that he was either selling goods on commission, or as clerk of Norton &amp; Blackstone ; that witness was, at the same time, doing professional business as an attorney for Walrath, and was willing to take the amount of his fees out of the store aforesaid; that Walrath said he should charge the same to himself; that witness did not contract with Norton &amp; Blackstone for said goods, and that he commenced trading with Walrath at said store about the first of December, 1846.</summary><summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b455-5\" pgmap=\"455\">S. W. Randall was also called by the plaintiffs and testified, that in 1846 and 1847 he was attorney for Walrath in some suits he had with Jacob Metzker; that he received frot\u00f3 Walrath out of the store of Norton &amp; Blackstone 531*32 towards his account against Walrath, supposing that the goods belonged to him| that some time in the spring of 1847, Mr. Pitzer, partner of the witness Crothers, called on witness and stated that he had said account, when witness told him he supposed the goods belonged to Walrath, but if Walrath did not pay for them, he supposed he should be obliged to pay for them; that he knew when the negotiation took place between Walrath and Metzker, and thought it was as early as the first part of June, and was quite confident that it was before defendant started for New York.</summary><summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b455-6\" pgmap=\"455(17) 456(35)\">The plaintiffs produced in evidence three certain papers between Metzker and Walrath, disposing of three suits between the latter, dated and filed July 26, 1847, and Randall testified that his recollection was very distinct that they were made and filed a considerable time after the .negotiation spoken of by Metzker.</summary><summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b456-5\" pgmap=\"456\">The defendant then read in evidence, after proof of its execution, the following receipt:</summary><summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b456-6\" pgmap=\"456\">\u201cRec\u2019d, Lockport, 10th July, 1847, from G.

Chapman, called by defendant, testified that he and defendant started for New York some time.in May, 1847, and in his opinion the negotiation spoken of by Metzker took place before they went, but was not consummated until after their return, some time in June.</summary><summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b456-8\" pgmap=\"456\">The foregoing was all the evidence in the case.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b456-9\" pgmap=\"456\">S.

The evidence tends to show that the accounts against Randall and Dodge were not included in the settlement.</p> <opinion data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <p id=\"b456-13\" pgmap=\"456\">The Opinion of the Court was delivered by</p> <author id=\"b456-14\" pgmap=\"456\">Treat, C. J.</author> <p id=\"AHd\" pgmap=\"456(32) 457(241)\">There can be no doubt that Walrath was originally liable to Norton &amp; Blackstone for the price of the goods sold to Dodge and Randall. The only question is, whether that liability has been discharged. The receipt was 'primafacie evidence of payment. A general receipt in full of all demands is presumed to be given on an adjustment of all transactions between the parties ; but such a receipt is subject to explanation, and may upon satisfactory proof be restrained in its operation. It may be shown thatthe settlement was in fact but a partial one, or, though intended to be general, that a particular, transaction was not taken into consideration. There are some circumstances in this case which tend strongly to show that the demand in question was not embraced in the settlement. Walrath, instead of debiting himself with the price of the goods on the books, charged them directly to Dodge and Randall. The accounts were drawn off and placed by him in the hands of attorney's for collection, and a receipt taken in the name of Norton &amp; Blackstone. The settlement was made at a distance from the town where these transactions took place, and probably when the parties had nothing but the books and the receipt of the attorneys before them. We think it very probable that, at the time of the settlement, Norton &amp; Blackstone knew nothing of the real circumstances respecting this demand, and therefore it was not taken into consideration by them. At all events, we are not prepared to say that the Circuit Court erred ih. coming to such a conclusion.</p> <p id=\"b457-5\" pgmap=\"457\">The judgment of the Circuit Court is affirmed with costs.</p> <p id=\"b457-6\" pgmap=\"457\">Judgment affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
