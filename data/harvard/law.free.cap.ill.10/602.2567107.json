W. L. a certain tract of land, upon certain specified terms, and allowed three months to decide upon the proposition. On the 26th of June, 1834, S. W. L. wrote to M., stating that his father, D. L., accepted the proposition, and signed the letter \u201cS. W. L., for his father, D. L.\u201d On the back of a copy of this letter, on the 19th of July, 1834, M. wrote and executed a covenant to convey the land to S. W. L., \u201cin consideration of the within,\u201d and \u201cwhen he shall have fulfilled on his part the conditions of the said agreement, a copy whereof is hereto annexed.\u201d This agreement was delivered to S. W. L., who made payments with money advanced by D. L., and took receipts as for money paid by D. L. S. W. L. took possession of and cultivated the land, D. L. residing with him till his death. D. L. died; S. W. L. paid the balance of the purchase money due upon the land, and the other heirs of D. L. then filed their bill against S.\" W. L. and M., alleging that the name of S. W. L. had been inserted by mistake in the contract of July 19th, 1834, instead of that of D. L., and praying for a partition of the land among the heirs of D. L., an account of rents and profits against S. W. L., &amp;c. S. W. L., in his answer, under oath, denied the mistake, and averred that the money advanced for the land had been loaned to him by D. L., to secure the payment of which D. L. was to have a lien on the land : Held, that the averment, in the answer of S. W. L., as to the loan, was new matter, and being unsupported by proof, was not evidence; that the question for the Court to determine was, whether it was the intention of the parties that the sale and purchase should be for the benefit of D. L. or S. W. L.; that the legal construction of the letter of acceptance of the 26th of June showed a purchase by D. L., and this construction could not be explained by parol, no mistake in that letter being pretended; that the written instruments above named, as well as the parol testimony, show that the name of S. W. L. was inserted, by mistake, in the agreement of the 19th of July, instead of that of D. L., and that there was no error in the decree of the Circuit Court which directed a partition of the land among the heirs of D. L., that S. W. L. should account for the rents and and profits, that he should be paid for the lasting improvements made by him , and be refunded the purchase money paid by him since the death of D. L. with interest, and that M. should convey to the heirs according to their respective interests.</headnotes><summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b618-7\" pgmap=\"618\">Bill in Chancery, filed in the Henderson Circuit Court, by the appellees, as heirs of David Lynn, deceased, against the appellant, Samuel W.

He says Munn knew the agreement between himself and father, and that the first instalment was to be advanced by his father, and that he could not get this unless his father approved of the location, and therefore he xvrote to Munn that David had \u201cconcluded to take the land;\u201d and that the words \u201cand pay you as agreed when you send to Quincy a bond for a deed,\u201d referred to the first payment, which David was to advance, as Munn knew;

denies that there was any mistake about it, and that he (Samuel) ex?er discovered any mistake as charged, but he says that for the purpose of securing a lien to David for his advances, he did request Munn\u2019s agents to procure a bond to convey the land to David on the payment of the purchase money;

Lynn, acting as the agent of his father, David Lynn, with means furnished by his father from time to time as the instalments fell due, purchased of Munn the land in controversy, taking receipts in the name of the father, (see the various writings signed by S. W. and by Munn, as also the receipts for the several payments.) After the father\u2019s death, the son paid an instalment with his own means. S. W. admits that the money was so furnished, and alleges that the receipts were so taken to give his father a lien on the property for such advances until a settlement between them, which he affirmatively asserts did take place, and in evidence thereof further says that the receipts, were delivered over to him. It did not appear, however, that the receipts taken by him on the payments ever went out of his possession, except by inference from his statement that they were delivered up to him. He further states that these several amounts coming from his father, were intended as advancements or donations; affirmative allegations, not responsive to the charges of the bill, and therefore not evidence unless supported by other proof. There is nothing in the whole case to show affirmatively that these payments were intended as advancements, nor are there circumstances from which such an intention is to be inferred. The whole case shows that S. W. had no. means \u2014 was obliged to hire money to come to the State, which his father was security for and subsequently paid. It further appears that he -did not claim -the land, but, while his father was li-ving, was willing, to say the least, that it should be considered as his father\u2019s. The only conclusion legitimately to be drawn from all the circumstances of the case, is that David Lynn, the father, was the purchaser and equitable owner of the land in question, and, had he have lived, would have paid the remaining instalment and taken the title from Munn, and the land, at his death, would have descended to the complainants.</p><p data-order=\"108\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b634-5\" pgmap=\"634\">On ihe whole, the decree of the Circuit Court is in accordance with the strict equity of the case, and ought not to be reversed, or modified in any respect.</p> <opinion data-order=\"109\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <p id=\"b634-6\" pgmap=\"634\">The Opinion of the Court was delivered by</p> <author id=\"AFqz\" pgmap=\"634\">Caton, J.</author> <p id=\"Ai3z\" pgmap=\"634(210) 635(57)\">On the l'8th of April, 1834, Stephen B. Munn made a written proposal, by the terms of which he-offered to sell to Samuel W. Lynn the, premises in question, upon certain specified terms, and allowed three months within which to accept the proposition. On the -26th of June, 1-834, S. W. Lynn wrote to Mr. Munn, stating that his father, who was David Lynn, now deceased, accepted the proposition, with perhaps some slight modifications, and signed the letter \u201cSamuel W. Lynn, for his father, David Lynn.\u201d On the back of a copy of -this letter, on the 19th of July, 1834, Munn wrote and executed a covenant to convey the premises to S. W. Lynn, upon the payments being made according to the terms as specified in the letter of acceptance, \"which agreement was delivered to Samuel, who made the first payment with the money, as is alleged, of David Lynn, and a receipt was taken specifying that the money was received of David by the hands of Samuel. Similar receipts were taken for all the balance of the purchase money, which was paid prior to the death of David. The balance, $286-10, was paid by Samuel W. to the agents of Munn. Some time after the execution of the agreement of the 19th of July, at the suggestion of Samuel W. Lynn, Munn executed in New York, and forwarded to his agents in Quincy,-a more formal indenture for the conveyance of the land to David Lynn, which was probably never seen or executed by. David, but still remains in the agents\u2019 hands.</p> <p id=\"b635-5\" pgmap=\"635\">The bill charges, that it was -the design and intention of all parties, that the sale of the land should be and was to David, and not to Samuel W.,and that the name of the latter was inserted in the original proposition, and in the agreement of the 19th of July, by mistake, and that all the payments which were made up -to the time of David\u2019s death, were \u00a1made with his money.</p> <p id=\"b635-6\" pgmap=\"635\">Samuel W. in his-answer denies the alleged mistake, and insists that the sale was intended to be made to him, and that although the money with which the payments were made came from his father, yet it was advanced to him as a loan, and that the receipts were taken in his father\u2019s name as an evidence of the amount of money paid, and for which David was entitled to a lien upon the laud. The answer admits that Samuel W., after-the agreement of the 19th of July, requested Munn\u2019s agents to get a bond for a deed running to David, as he says, in order that David might hold the land? who was to obligate himself to convey the land to Samuel W. or devise -it to him, upon settlement, and that this agreement would have been reduced to writing, but that Munn never executed the bond. It may be here remarked that if Munn never executed such a bend, he did execute and forward to his agents an agreement or indenture, the effect of which was the same, which, in all human probability, was executed in pursuance- of the suggestion made by Samuel W. to Munn\u2019s agents, that his father should have abend for a deed. Samuel went into possession, made improvements, and cultivated a farm upon the premises, and David resided there with him till the time of his death. David was old and infirm, and able to do but little manual labor at least.</p> <p id=\"b635-7\" pgmap=\"635(21) 636(65)\">Munn swears that he sold the land to David, and to no other person, and pertinaciously insists that he never made any contract for the sale of the land, except the one which which he sent on to his agents, and which appears never toll ave been executed or accepted by David. A good deal of evidence is adduced, showing the circumstances of Samuel, and his conduct and professions, as well as those of David, in relation to the purchase and ownership of the land.</p> <p id=\"b636-5\" pgmap=\"636\">It is not a question of so much real as apparent difficulty, \u2022 to determine for whose benefit this contract and purchase were really made, and to whom, in equity, this land really belongs. Upon a careful examination of the whole record we are satisfied with the decree of the Circuit Court. Were David alive, and this claim set up by him, instead of his heirs, there can be little doubt that his right should be sustained, and yet his legal representatives occupy precisely the same position.</p> <p id=\"b636-6\" pgmap=\"636(259) 637(115)\">Strictly speaking, it cannot be said that here is a resulting trust, for that is raised by implication or operation of law, from a particular state of facts evidencing the equitable rights of the parties, and does not depend upon a contract for its existence: as where land is purchased by the money of one and the title is conveyed to another, or perhaps where one trustee receives a title from another. In such a state of facts a trust is created by law, and not by .the agreement of the parties. Bottsford v. Burr, 2 Johns. Ch. R. 405. In case of a resulting trust, there should be a transfer of the legal title to one, while another is possessed of the equity. Here there has been no transfer of the legal title, but that still remains in Munn, whose liability to transfer it grows out of this contract of sale, and does not depend upon the simple fact of his having received the purchase money. The true character of this bill is for the specific performance of that contract, and not to compel the performance of a resulting trust. In cases of resulting trust it is frequently competent to inquire into the agreements of the parties, but then it is for the purpose of ascertaining with whose money the purchase was made. Samuel W. Lynn does not hold the legal title, and cannot be considered a trustee. Munn still holds the legal title, which he has agreed to transfer, and the question is, to whom he shall specifically perform the agreement. Thus the whole case is reduced to this one question; was it the intention of parties, that the sale and purchase should be for the benefit of David or Samuel? It will not do to rely upon the last formal indenture, running to David Lynn, which was executed on the part of Munn, but never executed by David on his part, as the contract of sale, for that was never executed or took effect. We must, therefore, look to the antecedent negotiations and transactions, together with the circumstances of the case as explanatory thereof, in order to determine to whom the sale was actually intended to be made.</p> <p id=\"b637-5\" pgmap=\"637\">So far as the written evidence shows, the first is a proposition for the sale of the land, in terms running to Samuel. This is answered by Samuel accepting the proposition for and in the name of his father. Upon the back of a copy of this letter of acceptance, Munn executed an undertaking: \u201cin consideration of the within, and in fulfillment of the agreement as aforesaid,\u201d he bound himself to convey to Samuel, \u201cwhen he shall have fulfilled, on his part, the conditions of the said agreement, a copy whereof is hereunto annexed.\u201d These three papers constitute the only evidence of the contract of sale upon which we can rely, except so far as it is competent for a Court of Equity to look to the other evidence to correct any mistake which was committed in drawing up the written evidence of the contract. For that purpose parol evidence is competent, but not to explain the meaning of the parties as expressed in the writings.</p> <p id=\"b637-6\" pgmap=\"637(124) 638(118)\">If we are to look alone at these papers, no doubt can exist that it was the intention of Samuel W. Lynn, only to occupy the position of an agent, and not of a purchaser. He intended to bind'his father and not himself for the payment of the purchase money. ' He proposed to purchase for his father, and not for himself. Such is undoubtedly the legal construction of that letter of acceptance, and as we have before seen, it is not competent to explain its .meaning, either by parol evidence or the defendant\u2019s answer, or in any way to alter it, except by showing a mistake, which is not pretended. Munn could have maintained no suit against Samuel for the purchase money, for he- never undertook to-pay it. Samuel\u2019s attempt, in his answer, to- explain away the effect of this letter must' be unavailing, for he does not pretend there was any mistake in its terms, and- hence the letter alone must evidence \"that intent. But if-i-t-were proper to look at the other evidence in the case,-we think it abundantly proved, even in-opposition to any thing contained-in his answer, that it was his-intention that the sale should be made to his father, and that it was his understandingthat it was so made. After he saw 'that M:unn had- agreed to convey to himself, he requested that a bond for a deed1 to his f\u00e1ther-should be given.</p> <p id=\"b638-5\" pgmap=\"638\">The purchase money was all advanced by his father, in whose name the receipts wer-e taken. His father lived with Samuel upon the land, and claimed to own it during his life time, although he sometimes manifested an intention to donate or devise it to Samuel, and once or twice even expressed himself as if it actually belonged to his son. Indee d the personal property upon the farm, when it was taken to satisfy Samuel\u2019s debts, was claimed by David, and Samuel offered to swear that it belonged to him.</p> <p id=\"b638-6\" pgmap=\"638(184) 639(388) 640(41)\">These circumstances, which tend so strongly to prove that the purchase was made by -and'fcxr David, and so understood and intended by Samuel, the latter attempts to explain awayin his answer by insisting-'that'the purchase money thus advanced by his father was really intended as a loan to him, and that the- conveyance-was to go to his father- as-a security, David agreeing to convey to Samuel upon a settlement of the advances so made, or to devise the land to him. But it must be remembered- that this allegation of a- loan is a new averment set up in the answer, and which is not proved by it, but must be sustained by affirmative evidence. Such evidence is wanting in this record; We are of opinion that this record shows, that it was the -intention and understanding of both David'and Samuel W.'Lynn, that the purchase was made by and for David, who alone was bound to pay the purchase money. Such is both the-legal and equitable construction of this contract \u00f3f purchase. Such being the ease, under the circumstances -as presented, even if Munn intended to sell, and supposed he was selling to Samuel instead of David, most probably the latter, or his heirs, would be entitled to a specific execution of the contract in their favor. But we think it equally clear that Munn intended to sell and supposed he was selling to David, and that Samuel\u2019s name was inserted in the instrument indorsed on the copy of the letter of acceptance, instead of David\u2019s, by mistake. By that letter Munn\u2019s proposition to sell the land was accepted by Samuel as the agent of David, and for him and in his name. The covenant to sell and convey was indorsed on the back of a copy of this, and referred to it as the consideration of the undertaking and professes to be in fulfillment of it, and says the land shall be conveyed \u201cwhen he shall have fulfilled, on his part, the conditions of said agreement, a copy whereof is hereunto annexed.\u201d No man can read this covenant without being convinced that it was the intention of Munn to make his covenant, which[was his part of the contract of sale, conform to the other part, which was contained in the letter referred to, which bound David Lynn to purchase and pay for the land. It took both of these papers to constitute the contract of sale and purchase of this land, and Munn could have had no other design than to make his part of the agreement conform to the other, if he intended to avail himself of the obligations contained in it. We, therefore, think that the papers themselves furnish sufficient evidence of the alleged mistake. But more than this : Munn swears that he never intended to sell and never did sell the premises to Samuel W. Lynn, but that he sold them to David alone. It is true he does not state directly, that the name of Samuel was inserted by mistake in that contract, for it seems impossible to make him recognize that agreement at all, and he insists that the subsequent indenture, which does not appear to have been executed by David, contains the only evidence of the sale. In this, however, he is evidently mistaken, for the other papers stand here undisputed, and, as we have,already seen, -show-a complete contract. At any rate his testimony seems to show that at no time did he ever intend to sell to Samuel, and conse-: quently, if, by the terms of the agreement, he proposed to sell to him, it was by mistake.-</p> <p id=\"b640-5\" pgmap=\"640\">The decree very properly provides for reimbursing Samuel for whatever permanent improvements he may have made upon the land, as well as for the purchase money which he has paid since his father\u2019s death, and with this he must be content. It may be true that it was the intention of his father to donate or devise the land to him, perhaps as a consideration, in part, for the care which he took of him in his old age, but until such intention was carried out by a conveyance or bequest, it could create no legal or equitable right which the Court can recognize. If he is entitled to any compensation for taking care of or providing for his father, we cannot award it to him in this proceeding, but he must seek his remedy elsewhere.</p> <p id=\"b640-6\" pgmap=\"640\">The decree of the Circuit Court is affirmed and &amp; procedendo awarded to the Circuit Court.</p> <p id=\"b640-7\" pgmap=\"640\">Decree affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
