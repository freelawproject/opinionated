Perry,--Weed, and Fairchild Weed procured a contract on said Rail Road, and that they proceeded with the work upon the same, said Wilson superintending the work on the Rail Road, and said Campbell that on the Canal, and that each had an equal interest therein; that subsequently to June, 1838, said Wilson sold out to said Campbell and one McFarrin, for $1100, all his interest in the Canal contract, and for which he was paid in full; at the same time, it was privately agreed that said Wilson should return one half of all the interest, being one half of the whole contract, meaning that said Wilson should have one quarter of all the profits on said contract.</summary><summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b400-8\" pgmap=\"400(150) 401(141)\">The bill then alleged, that the reason for such private agreement, was to enable said Wilson to procure from said McFarrin and Campbell, the goods and stores necessary to carry on the Rail Road contract, without exciting the jealousy of said McFarrin, and also to enable said Wilson and Campbell to obtain means to commence said work on the Rail Road, by selling to said McFarrin a portion of the Canal profits ; that in February, 1839, said Campbell sold out all of his and Wilson\u2019s interest in the Canal contract to McFarrin for 1000 dollars, and that he, Campbell, took a sub-contract on the Rail Road with the consent of, but unconnected with said Wilson, without affecting his interest in said Rail Road contract. The bill then averred that all such bargains, sales, &amp;c., were made in good faith, and with the consent of Wilson, and with the understanding that they were equal sharers and partners in the Rail Road and Canal contracts. Complainant then stated his readiness and desire to account and settle with Wilson, but that Wilson would not, and denied owing any thing to him. Complainant further averred, that at the time the Rail Road contract was given up on account of the stoppage of payment by the State, the amount of profits due to said complainant and Wilson on the same, was at least $8,000, and he believes $12,000, the whole of which was received by Wilson, and to one-half of which he was entitled ; that said Wilson refused to pay the same, or any of-it, and refused to account.

He denied that there was any agreement that the superintendence of one on the Canal should be equivalent to that of the other on the Rail Road, but admitted that he agreed with said Campbell and McFarrin, to allow them for the time that he spent, less, upon the Canal, than said Campbell and McFarrin.</summary><summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b401-5\" pgmap=\"401(75) 402(359)\">He admitted, that in June, 1838, in connection with Man-ville and others, they entered into a contract with the State for work on the Central Rail Road, and proceeded with their work on said Rail Road. He admitted the sale of his interest in the Canal contract for $1,100 to Campbell and McFarrin, but denied the private agreement alleged in said bill. He stated, that upon entering into such sale of his interest in the Canal contract, Campbell expressed some unwillingness to pay the amount, he proposed to said Campbell that if he did not make the $1,100 and wages he would pay back the deficiency provided Campbell would agree to give him one-half the profits over and above the sum of $1,100 and Campbell\u2019s-wages. He denied that his reasons for selling were truly, stated in said bill, denied that Campbell ever advanced a single dollar to carry on the work on the Rail Road contract, or that his, Campbell\u2019s, name was ever used in connection with it to raise funds for its construction. He alleged,, that soon after this sale he had a settlement with McFarrin and Campbell, and it was proved that they were indebted to him in the sum of $2,800, and'that the goods and stores furnished him by said Campbell were to go in liquidation of said indebtedness, and were not an advance made to carry on the work. He believed Campbell sold out to McFarrin his interest in said Canal contract, for $1,000 in February, 1839, and took a sub-contract on the Rail Road, hut denied that he, Wilson, had at that time any interest in the same. He admitted that the work on the Rail Road stopped when the State stopped payments of estimates, but denied that his share of the profits was $8,000. He averred, that when he and others took the Rail Road contract, it was considered too low and would prove a losing operation j that during the first six months they did not receive sufficient estimates to pay expenses, and that it was necessary to raise funds out of their own private means. He averred that Campbell never advanced anything towards said contract; that soon after the sale of his Canal interest, he, Campbell, left the country for six months; that during his absence he never wrote to him, W\u2019ilson* nor did he ever express a wish to become interested in it until one month after his return, at which time and not before, he, Wilson, and the company were receiving sufficient estimates to pay the expenses.</summary><summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b402-5\" pgmap=\"402(27) 403(32)\">He admitted, that each were to be equally interested in said Rail Road contract, with the express understanding, however, that each should contribute an equal amount to. prosecute said work.

Owens, Complainanfs witness'. \u2014 Knows the-parties : In the spring of 1838, the defendant informed the witness that Campbell, John H. McFarr-in and Norman Mc-Farrin were bidding for contracts on Central Rail Road and also that the witness with the defendant, C. H. Perry, Henry Weed, E. F. Weed, and N. W. Manville were also bidding;: that they were bidding together, and that if either or both obtained bids, each were to be equally interested. McFarrin, complainant, and the defendant were interested in the Canal contract; the defendant told witness that he had sold out his interest in the same for ten or eleven hundred dollars to complainant and McEamm. On the day of Rail Road letting, the defendant told the witness that he and Campbell were to retain equal interests in the Canal and Rail Road contracts, if either of them got any work on the Rail Road; that the defendant was to take charge of the work on the Rail Road and complainant on the Canal, and their time was to be set off each against the other. Four sections were allotted to the defendant and others of the company;-. the name first used by them was N. W. Manville &amp; Co.; after- \u2022 wards Perry, Wilson &amp; Co. The defendant told witness that he had offered complainant $100 for his interest in the Rail Road contract, but complainant would not take it. This was two or three weeks after the letting aforesaid.</summary><summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b404-5\" pgmap=\"404\">In 1839, complainant sold out his interest in the Canal, and with one W.

In the winter of 1839, witness had conversations with the complainant in regard to the complainant and said defendant\u2019s business on said road, in which he informed complainant what he had heard the defendant say, witness\u2019 interest with Campbell was got by purchasing Seward\u2019s interest in the sub-contract under Perry, Wilson &amp; Co.; witness sold his interest to Perry, Wilson &amp; Co, in August or September, 1838. Estimates had been taken every month by the Engineer ; thinks no moneys were received until after he sold out, and about three months after commencing the work; witness had one-sixth part of original contract, and received of Perry, Wilson &amp; Co. for his share, $500; the advances were made by each individual, but not in equal proportions ; debts were contracted by the company ; does not know how much each advanced ; thinks Wilson advanced 500 dollars in cash and other property; others advanced teams, wagons, &amp;c.; does not know amount of outstanding debts of Co. but thinks they were considerable; witness and Manville advanced about $.600; Manville sold his interest to Perry, Wilson &amp; Co. at same time Wilson did ; thinks that part of the articles advanced by witness and Manville were returned to them; they were paid $600 in cash, balance in paying outstanding debts against them. The original contract was not considered by him or the company, as an unprofitable one; the amount of the whole contract was $150,000 ; witness sold out his interest because he was told Manville would have to leave ; and he and Man-ville were getting behind in their advances, and Perry, Wilson &amp; Co. promised to aid them in obtaining another contract the next year. Defendant had also agreed to aid witness and Manville with funds, but had failed to do so, alleging inability; took a sub-contract under the company about a year after selling out; the complainant took his sub-contract in February, 1839; understood that complainant was part of the time on Rock river, sick, after the letting, and before taking the sub-contract. In December or January, 1841, had difficulty with the defendant about a hog, but he supposes it was then settled.</summary><summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b405-4\" pgmap=\"405\">Re-Examination in chief. \u2014 The above conversations between the defendant and witness, were caused in consequence of discovering an intimacy between the compl\u00e1inant and the defendant on the day of letting, which led him to fear something was going on prejudicial to his interest, and he was then led to make inquiries of the defendant.</summary><summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b405-5\" pgmap=\"405(204) 406(25)\">John TI. McFarrin, Complainant\u2019s witness. \u2014 Is acquainted with parties to suit; was a partner with them in the Canal contract; partnership commenced in June or July, 1838; were equal partners.

Defendant drew goods, &amp;e. out of the store of the complainant and witness, to the amount of his investment; the whole $1,100 has been paid in full; it was all paid before the section was completed, excepting eighty-five dollars. Witness purchased out Campbell\u2019s interest, 29th of Jan. 1839, paid him $1,000 dollars for it; in settlement with the complainant, he bore his proportion of said payment to Wilson. At the time witness purchased complainant\u2019s interest, about $800 was unpaid of the $1,100. Defendant was not present at the time of this sale ; he knew it about a week after, and made no objection. After the Canal contract was completed,, and after the suspension of work on the Rail Road, in the fall of 1841, the defendant told me that as Campbell was sick on Rock river,, and not being</summary><summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b406-5\" pgmap=\"406\">\u25a0 on the work, he did not consider the complainant entitled to any thing, but he had offered complainant $100, and rather \u2022than have a suit about it, he would give $800.

Weed, thus becoming owners of one half the whole contract ; that there was no evidence to show when defendant bought said interest of Weed, or how much he paid for it, nor whose funds were used in paying Weed, and no evidence was introduced on which such an account could be stated. That the day book and ledger admitted in evidence showed that the defendant was charged with $25,286-67, and credited with $16,230-88, which leaves a balance against defendant of $9,055-99, which, assuming the books to be full and correct, the Commissioner proceeded to say would be the amount of the defendant\u2019s individual profit on said contract ; that the hooks contained no memoranda of the distribution of damages to members, of which there is evidence that it amounted to $6000 in Illinois scrip; that the books showed no distinction in the charges and credits to the defendant at the different times he owned different amounts of interest; that the books furnished no sufficient data on which to rely, and that the bill and answer, depositions and parol evidence before the Commissioner, constituted the only reliable evidence. That from the best evidence the profits of the defendant were $6,500 on one fourth of the contract, and which came into his hands. Deduct for fourteen and three fourth months\u2019 absence of the complainant $737-50-100 from $6,500 left balance of $5,672-50, one half of which is charged to the defendant as due to the complainant; that the last payment on the Rail Road was received 28th March, 1840, from which time add interest at six per cent, on half the amount of $5,762-50 is $768-31, which in the aggregate amounts to $3,649 53, the amount due complainant by the defendant. He further stated that there was evidence of $6,000 in Illinois scrip having been received as damages from the State, but that there was also evidence that a considerable amount of same was paid out for indebtedness, and no evidence that any of it was received by the defendant; that there is some contrariety in the evidence as to the value of the scrip, but that this value was immaterial on account of the uncertainty of the amount of same received by the defendant on final settlement.</summary><summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b412-4\" pgmap=\"412\">At the September term, 1844, the Hon.

Hence, no further accounting or settlement is needed, except as between complainant and defendant. Whenever the object of a joint undertaking is completed, it is a dissolution of the copartnership. Story on Partn. \u00a7 280.</p><p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b416-8\" pgmap=\"416\">By an application of these principles to this case, if the parties had a joint interest in the funds used on canal and rail road, there must be a decree for complainant.

No relief is sought by virtue of this agreement, but by virtue of the partnership which resulted from the agreement. We claim a participation in the profits of the partnership, and the only effect of the agreement is to define the nature and extent of the partnership.

J.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> </author> <p id=\"Ar1\" pgmap=\"418\">One branch of this case \u2014 that relating to ' the canal contract \u2014 is easily decided. The bill states that Campbell &amp; McFarrin' purchased the share of Wilson in this contract, but alleges a secret arrangement between Campbell and Wilson, by which the latter still retained an interest in the contract. The answer admits the sale, but denies the private agreement charged in the bill. There is no proof that any such agreement was made; on the contrary, it clearly appears that the sale was bona fide, and absolute in its terms. There was then no partnership between the parties in this contract to be adjusted by a Court of Equity.</p> <p id=\"b418-6\" pgmap=\"418\">The other branch of the case relates to the rail road contract. The bill does not seek the specific performance of an agreement for a partnership, but it proceeds on theground that there has been a subsisting partnership, in the settlement of which the aid of a Court of Equity is necessary. A mere agreement to form a partnership does not of itself create a partnership. The parties must enter on the execution of the agreement before the relation of partners exists between them. While the agreement remains executory, if one of them refuses to carry it into effect, the only remedy of the other is by an action at Law for the violation of the agreement, or by a bill in Equity to enforce specifically its performance.</p> <p id=\"b418-7\" pgmap=\"418(76) 419(164)\">It was probably the understanding of these parties, that each should, under certain circumstances, become equally interested in whatever contract either might obtain on the rail road. The question is, was this understanding so carried into effect as to constitute them partners in the contract procured by Wilson. We are clearly satisfied that no partnership in fact existed between them in the execution of this contract. The acts of the parties afford the strongest evidence that they did not regard themselves as jointly interested. In the prosecution of the work under the contract, Wilson performed all the services, made all the advancements, and incurred all the responsibilities. Campbell claimed no control over the contract, nor in any manner concerned himself about its performance. Wilson did not recognize him as a partner, but on all occasions denied that he was such. The offer of Wilson to give Campbell one hundred dollars for his interest in the contract \u2014 proved by the witness, Owens \u2014 was made before the work commenced ; and his subsequent statement to McFarrinno doubt referred to the same proposition. After Campbell sold out his interest in the canal contract, he took a sub-contract from Wilson and his associates for work on this very rail road contract. If a partner of Wilson, why did he not join him in prosecuting the contract to completion instead of becoming a sub-contractor under him.</p> <p id=\"b419-5\" pgmap=\"419(207) 420(11)\">The statements of the bill respecting the objects of the partnership, and the mode of conducting it deserve consideration. These statements are, that the sale of Wilson\u2019s share in the canal contract was not real, but, as between Campbell and Wilson, an expedient only to enable them to procure means and credit at the store of Campbell &amp; Mc-Farrin to prosecute the rail road contract, and that Wilson should superintend the work on this contract and Campbell that on the canal; in other words, they were partners in both contracts, and the services of one were to be an equivalent for those of the other, while the means for carrying on both contracts were to be obtained from the firm of Campbell &amp; McFarrin. The proof shows conclusively that these allegations are untrue. The sale was absolute, and Wilson from that time ceased to be interested in the canal contract. The sale was made about the time the work on the rail road was commenced, and Campbell could not therefore perform any services on the eanal that would enure to the benefit of Wilson. By the terms of the sale, Campbell &amp; McFarrin became largely indebted to Wilson, and the moneys and goods received by him were in liquidation of this indebtedness.</p> <p id=\"b420-5\" pgmap=\"420\">The evidence fails wholly to make out a case of partnership, and if Campbell has a cause of action against Wilson, it is for a violation of the agreement to form a partnership, to be enforced by \"a suit at Law.</p> <p id=\"b420-6\" pgmap=\"420\">The Circuit Court erred in decreeing that a partnership existed, and consequently all of the subsequent proceedings in the case were erroneous.</p> <p id=\"b420-7\" pgmap=\"420\">The decree of the Circuit Court is reversed with costs, and the bill dismissed.</p> <p id=\"b420-8\" pgmap=\"420\">Bill dismissed.</p> <footnote label=\"*\"> <p id=\"b418-8\" pgmap=\"418\">Caton, J. took no part in the decision of this cause, it having been removed by change of venue from the Circuit where he was formerly the presiding Justice.</p> </footnote> </opinion> </casebody> ",
