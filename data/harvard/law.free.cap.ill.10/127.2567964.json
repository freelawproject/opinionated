The 49th section of the Practice Act provides that the Supreme Court may enter final judgment, arid the 52nd section provides that the Supreme Court, in case of partial reversal, should give such judgment as the inferior Court ought to have given, and such has been the uniform practice of this Court.

Wallace, 3 do. 496.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b143-12\" pgmap=\"143(21) 144(16)\">If the judgment is erroneous, on the authority of the foregoing cases, this Court will enter judgment here for the defendants in error for $6,321-34 and interest, to be paid in the due course of administration.</p> <opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <p id=\"b144-5\" pgmap=\"144\">The Opinion of the Court was delivered by</p> <author id=\"b144-6\" pgmap=\"144\">Treat, C.
