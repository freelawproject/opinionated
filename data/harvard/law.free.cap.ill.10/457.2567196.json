Goodhue, one of the attorneys for the plaintiff in this cause, offered a motion for a rule to the defendant to file his plea by a certain day of that term, and that this affiant, as the attorney for the said defendant, then and there proposed to the said Goodhue, in order to save costs to the parties litigant herein, to draw up a written statement of the case and submit them to the Court upon the questions of law involved in the case, and to abide the decision of the Court in the same, and to waive the filing of pleas by the defendant, and that this affiant understood the said Goodhue, at the time and afterwards, expressly to agree to said proposition, made as aforesaid by this affiant; and that this affiant reposed full confidence in the agreement of the said Goodhue, and that it would be carried out in good faith, and in consequence thereof, this affiant did not know, until the sitting of the present term of this Court, that any rule had been entered for a plea in said cause.

That such decision cannot be assigned for error has been so often decided by this Court that it is unnecessary to discuss the question again. And since the decision of Wallace v. Jerome, 1 Scam. 524, it can hardly be expected that any case of hardship will ever form an exception to the rule. This was the only exception taken in the Circuit Court and the only question presented by the record.</p> <p id=\"b475-4\" pgmap=\"475\">The judgment is affirmed with costs.</p> <p id=\"b475-5\" pgmap=\"475\">Judgment affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
