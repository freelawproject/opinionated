The second plea was payment, and the fifth was that the defendant, at the September term, 1842, of the County Commissioners\u2019 Court of Washington county, paid over to said Court all the revenue which he had up to that time- collected, or been able to collect, and that at said term, said County Commissioners\u2019 Court took from him the Collector\u2019s hooks, by which means he was prevented from collecting any more of said revenue after that time. The parties went to trial upon those issues.</summary><summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b248-9\" pgmap=\"248\">The plaintiffs offered in evidence the defendant\u2019s receipt as Collectpr of the taxes for the year 1841, showing the amount of county revenue receipted for, to be two thousand, three hundred and ninety eight dollars, and ninety seven cents.</summary><summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b248-10\" pgmap=\"248(79) 249(173)\">The defendant then offered as evidence the following order upon the records of the County Commissioners\u2019 Court at their September term, 1842, to wit: \u201cAnd now at this day came Isaac Parlier, Collector of the revenue of the county of Washington, and Court went into a settlement with Isaac Parlier, Collector of the revenue for the year A. D. 1841, from which it appears that said Collector\u2019s credits, including the amount of tax yet to he collected, amounts t@ $2551,\u00a1,30, from which deduct $2398,9j0, total amount of county tax for the year 1841, leaves a balance in favor of said collector of $152-16 cents. E. E. On re-examination, on page 391, an excess of credits appears allowed said collector in this settlement of $115 .Toand also offered to prove by one Henry Williamson, a County Commissioner of said county at the time of the entry of said order, that the Collector\u2019s books were about that time handed over to one Salem Goodner, and that it was his impression that they were handed over by the County Commissioners. The plaintiffs objected to the introduction in evidence of said order of the County Commissioners\u2019 Court, and also to the testimony of said Williamson. The objections were overruled, and the same admitted in evidence, to which the plaintiffs at the time excepted. Said Williamson also testified that it was the understanding at the time, that all errors were to be rectified. This was all the testimony on the part of the defendant;</summary><summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b249-5\" pgmap=\"249\">The plaintiffs then offered a witness to prove that there was a mistake in said settlement of the County Commissioners\u2019 Court, by which the said Parlier had received too large a credit by about three hundred dollars. This testimony the Court refused to receive, and decided said settlement to be conclusive upon the County, to which decision the plaintiffs excepted.</summary><summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b249-6\" pgmap=\"249\">This was all the testimony in the cause.

No evidence was introduced, and nothing before the Court but the mere report of the Collector, and upon it the Court acted.</p><p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b250-11\" pgmap=\"250\">Suppose that there is a mistake in the settlement, and the State should sue the Collector for its part, could the Collector set up his settlement with the County Commissioners\u2019 Const as conclusive ?</p><p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b250-12\" pgmap=\"250\">This power of the County Commissioners is likened to the power of the Probate Justice of the Peace to take the proof of wills, which is only prima facie evidence of the validity, of the will, and it may be set aside on an issue ordered out of Chancery.</p><p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b250-13\" pgmap=\"250\">If the doctrine be true, that the settlement of the County Commissioners\u2019 Court is conclusive, great injustice may be done. A mistake would not likely be ascertained during the \u201e term of Court. The County could not take an appeal, and the county and State would be entirely without a remedy to correct the error.</p> <opinion data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <p id=\"b251-4\" pgmap=\"251\">The Opinion of the Court was delivered by</p> <author id=\"b251-5\" pgmap=\"251\">Caton, J.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> </author> <p id=\"Aso\" pgmap=\"251\">This was a motion made under the statute, by the County against the Collector, to recover a balance of the revenue in his hands, which he had collected and not paid over or accounted for. The defendant gave in evidence an order from the records of the County Commissioners\u2019 Court, showing a settlement with the Collector, and a balance in his favor of one hundred and fifty two dollars and sixteen cents, and then a subsequent order showing that upon a re-examination of the accounts, it appeared that the Collector had been allowed too great a credit by one hundred and fifteen dollars and seventy six cents. These orders were objected to by the plaintiff, but admitted in evidence by the Court. The plaintiff offered to prove a mistake in the settlement, by showing that the defendant had been credited with three hundred dollars too much. This the Court refused to allow, to which the plaintiff excepted.</p> <p id=\"b251-6\" pgmap=\"251(188) 252(77)\">The case of Kinney v. The People, 3 Scam. 357, we think in point. There the Board of Public Works were vested with the same powers and jurisdiction, in relation to the subject matter of that dispute, which the County Commissioners have in relation to this. Both had authority to adjust, audit, and settle certain accounts and matters. In speaking of the powers exercised by the Board of Public Works, the Court said: \u201cIt does not possess the character and partake of judicial powers, but simply those of agency on the part of the State, to state an account and agree upon a balance. In the case before us, had the mistake been against the defendant, he would think it very hard to be concluded by the order, especially when he has proved that it was agreed at the time that all mistakes should be corrected. In making this settlement, the Commissioners act as the agents of the County, and do not adjudicate as a Court. They could enter up no judgment against the defendant for the balance found due, nor have they any means of enforcing payment of such balance, except by a resort to the ordinary Courts of Law. As the fiscal agents of the County, their mistakes may be inquired into and corrected as well as those of an individual acting in his own behalf. The record of this settlement is but a memorandum of the transaction, and is only prima facie evidence of the correctness of the result stated. The explanatory evidence offered should have been admitted.</p> <p id=\"b252-5\" pgmap=\"252\">The judgment of the Circuit Court is reversed and the cause remanded.</p> <p id=\"b252-6\" pgmap=\"252\">Judgment reversed.</p> <footnote label=\"*\"> <p id=\"b251-7\" pgmap=\"251\"> Trumbull, J., having been of counsel, took no part in the decision.</p> </footnote> </opinion> </casebody> ",
