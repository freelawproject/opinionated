The claim was in the face of rather strong conflicting evidence offered by the State, and an all-male jury convicted him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-19\">In this habeas corpus proceeding, Mc-Creight complains of the exclusion of women from the jury. In 1962, women were ineligible for jury service in South Carolina, though that no longer is the case. Exclusion of women from jury service in that state is now a relic of the past.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-20\">Under the circumstances, we find no deprivation of any constitutional right which Is cognizable in collateral proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-21\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
