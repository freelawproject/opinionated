The district court denied relief. The complainant perfected an appeal to this Court. He then filed a formal motion for a stay of proceedings pending the final disposition of Ferrell v. Dallas Independent School District [5 Cir., 1968, 392 F.2d 697 ; cert. denied 393 U.S. 856, 89 S.Ct. 98, 21 L.Ed.2d 125 (1968)]. The application for the stay alleged that the issue in this case was similar to that in <em>Ferrell, </em>supra. The stay was granted. Upon final disposition of <em>Ferrell, </em>this appeal was calendared and has been duly heard.</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-4\">We are of the opinion that there is no material difference between this case and <em>Ferrell. </em>Our decision in that case, therefore, must control the disposition of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-5\">The judgment of the district court is Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
