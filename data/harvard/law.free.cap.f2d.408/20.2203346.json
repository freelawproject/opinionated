NACA\u2019s claim in that respect was contested by appellee, Frank S. Blackford, the Trustee. The Referee disallowed NACA\u2019s claim on several grounds and the United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama, upon review, affirmed the Referee\u2019s rulings. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-12\">July 21, 1965, NACA entered into a three-year factor\u2019s lien agreement with Bankrupt, the purpose of which was to provide NACA with security for sums of money being advanced by it to Bankrupt. Under the agreement, Bankrupt gave NACA the security of a factor\u2019s lien <em>on Bankrupt\u2019s materials, goods in process, and finished goods intended for sale </em>for all loans and advances to be made to Bankrupt \u201cand for all indebtedness and liabilities of every kind of <em>Borrower </em>to <em>Lender, </em>hereinafter owing: * * (Emphasis added.) However, no mention was made of any specific indebtedness to be covered other than a $50,000 loan made simultaneously with the lien agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-16\">July 28, 1965, Bankrupt executed a separate five-year lease agreement in Alabama for <em>rental </em>of certain machinery and equipment by NACA to Bankrupt. The agreement was completed and accepted by NACA some two months later, in September, 1965, at Chicago, Illinois.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-17\">By the terms of the lease, the lessor, NACA, in the event of default, could sell the equipment and then be entitled to recover from the lessee, Bankrupt, the total unpaid rentals less proceeds from the sale. The lease contract made no mention of, or reference to, the earlier factor\u2019s lien agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-18\">When default occurred, NACA, in accordance with the terms of the <em>lease </em>agreement, sold the equipment and ultimately asserted before the Referee a claim for $11,244.12, this sum representing the unpaid rental of $17,244.12, less proceeds of $6,000.00 received from the sale. It further claimed that this balance was secured by the factor\u2019s lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-19\">The Referee found the claim deficient in three respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-20\">First, he held that NACA\u2019s owning and leasing of personal property in Alabama constituted \u201cdoing business\u201d within the meaning of Code of Alabama, Title 51, Sec. 339, thus requiring NACA to qualify to do business as required by State law; and since NACA failed to so qualify, Code of Alabama, Title 51, Sec. 342, made the lease agreement unenforceable in Alabama, making the rent claim also unenforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-21\">Second, he held that the lease agreement was a security instrument within the meaning of Code of Alabama, Title 47, Sections 110, 123, and 131, and thus had to be recorded. Failure to so record the agreement, he held, was fatal to the rent claim arising out of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>Finally, he held that the factor\u2019s agreement did not contemplate the type of indebtedness here involved; that, accordingly the claim was not secured.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">NACA contends that the Referee erred in all these findings. It also argues that the Referee\u2019s application of State rather than Federal law in deciding whether the claim was valid, even though NACA did not comply with Alabama law with regard to qualifying to do business, was both erroneous and unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">The threshold issue presented to us is whether, even assuming for present purposes that it legally existed, the claim was secured by the factor\u2019s lien agreement. If it was not, then NACA could not have enjoyed secured creditor status with respect to the claim involved, making it unnecessary for us to consider the other issues. We hold that the claim was not secured by the factor\u2019s lien agreement, and to that extent affirm, without findings as to the Alabama law regarding \u201cdoing business.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">As previously mentioned, the factor\u2019s lien agreement is couched in broad language. It states that \u201call indebtedness and liabilities <em>of every kind </em>of the <em>Borrower </em>to <em>Lender, </em>hereinafter owing\u201d (emphasis added), are secured by the factor\u2019s lien. Moreover, Alabama\u2019s statute authorizing such a factor\u2019s lien allows security of \u201call * * * loans and advances to or for the account of the person creating the lien (hereinafter called <em>the \u2018borrower\u2019), </em>together with interest thereon, <em>and also </em>for the commissions, <em>obligations, indebtedness, </em>charges, and expenses properly chargeable against or due from said <em>borrower </em>and for the amounts due or owing upon <em>any </em>notes or <em>other obligations </em>given to or received by them for or upon account of any such loans or advances, interests, commissions, <em>obligations, indebtedness, </em>charges, and expenses, * * (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">NACA argues that this language found in the factor\u2019s agreement and in the quoted statute is sufficiently broad to cover the type of indebtedness here, <em>i. e., </em>a claim for rent following default in the lease agreement, secured not only by the leased property, but generally.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-10\">Factoring, such as is involved here, is completely different from traditional common law factoring. That distinction is explained in the following passage from In re Freeman, 294 F.2d 126, 129 (3 Cir. 1961) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-11\">\u201cAt the common law a factor was an agent employed to sell goods for a principal and receive a commission thereon. The factor had a lien on the goods for any advances made by him and for his commissions. The common law factor\u2019s lien was founded on the possession of the goods of his principal and served the function of securing him for the advances owed by the principal. In re Tele-Tone Radio Corp., D.C.D.N.J.1955, 133 F.Supp. 739 ; 4 Collier, Bankruptcy \u00a7 70.77 (14 ed. 1942) ; Skilton, The Factor\u2019s Lien on Merchandise, 1955 Wis.L.Rev. 356, 367.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-12\">\u201cThe modern factor, however, is a financier who generally lends monies and takes in return an assignment of accounts receivable or some other security. He is not a selling agent. In re Tele-Tone Radio Corp., supra ; 4 Collier, op.cit. supra. It is the modern factor who is the primary beneficiary of the factors\u2019 lien statutes of the various states. They were enacted to foster his growth and function. Those statutes authorize a floating lien on inventory giving the modern factor a lien without the necessity of taking and maintaining possession of the pledged property. In re Frederick Speier Footwear Corp., D.C.D.Conn.1955, 129 F.Supp. 434 ; Ogline, The Factor\u2019s Lien Act as a Method of Inventory Financing, 4 W.Res.L.Rev. 336, 339 (1953).\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b79-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>Factors\u2019 lien statutes commonly authorize security of many kinds of indebtedness.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This can be seen in In re Frederick Speier Footwear Corp., 129 F.Supp. 434 (D.C.Conn.1955), the case on which NACA primarily relies. There, one Iselen had purchased accounts receivable of the bankrupt with the understanding that Iselen would bear any loss resulting from the financial inability of the customer of the bankrupt to pay, but that Iselen would not be responsible for any such customers\u2019 nonpayment of their accounts resulting from ony other cause, such as defective merchandise. Several years later, the parties entered into an agreement, pursuant to Connecticut\u2019s factor\u2019s lien statute, which, like Alabama\u2019s statute here, authorized security of all \u201cobligations and indebtedness\u201d due from the <em>borrower </em>to the <em>lender. </em>Credit was extended to the bankrupt, the security being a factor\u2019s lien on the bankrupt\u2019s materials, work in process, and merchandise. The agreement also provided security for \u201call obligations and indebtedness\u201d owed from time to time to Iselen, by the bankrupt, however arising, including all obligations and indebtedness of the bankrupt to Iselen <em>which arose under the provisions of the previous contract relative to Iselen\u2019s purchase of accounts receivable.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b79-4\">Thereafter substantial indebtedness arose between the parties due to Iselen\u2019s charge-back to the bankrupt of accounts receivable previously purchased by it which had proven uncollectible because the merchandise sold by the bankrupt had been rejected by buyers due to defective manufacture and similar reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-12\">In later bankruptcy proceedings, the Referee ruled that, under the factor\u2019s lien agreement, Iselen was a secured creditor for the charge-back indebtedness. The District Court affirmed the Referee\u2019s decision. However, rather than rest its holding only upon the broad \u201cobligations\u201d and \u201cindebtedness\u201d language, the Court made it clear that the following were crucially important: (1) the indebtedness in question was <em>specifically included </em>in the factor\u2019s lien agreement, and (2) the indebtedness arose from transactions that were related to the general course of the borrower\u2019s business. <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b79-13\">Neither of those elements were present here. There was no mention of any rent obligation in the factor\u2019s agreement; nor was there anything in the lease concerning security except as to ownership of the leased equipment. The lease agreement was nothing more nor less than just that.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b79-14\">Nor does it appear that the rent obligation arising out of the lease was in any other way connected with the factor\u2019s lien agreement. To the contrary, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>duration of the respective agreements\u2014 three years as concerned the factor\u2019s lien and five years as to the lease \u2014 plainly shows that the parties did not relate the two together in their minds. Moreover, the factor\u2019s agreement was couched in terms of \u201cLender\u201d and \u201cBorrower,\u201d whereas the lease was a pure lessor-lessee contract. Consequently, with respect to the factor\u2019s lien, appellant was a \u201cLender\u201d and Bankrupt was a \u201cBorrower,\u201d whereas in the lease contract NACA was a \u201clessor\u201d and Bankrupt was a \u201cLessee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">With this total absence of nexus between the lease indebtedness and the factor\u2019s lien agreement, we hold that the broad language of the factor\u2019s lien agreement was an insufficient basis upon which to conclude that such lease indebtedness was secured by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">Holding as we do, that NACA was not a secured creditor, it is unnecessary to consider the other questions it has raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b78-8\">.
