No. 140). After full consideration of all the pleadings involved we conclude that the Board\u2019s Decision and Order must be affirmed only insofar as it is consistent with the dictates of this opinion and that it must be disregarded insofar as it bases its Order upon an invalid and untenable conclusion of law. (Conclusion of Law #3, Board\u2019s Decision at 9.)</p>\n<p id=\"b227-23\">Since the dispute in this case is largely factual the facts and circumstances involved will be set out in detail. On May 17, 1966, petitioner was awarded a contract with the General Services Administration (hereinafter \u201cGSA\u201d) for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>maintenance service of the Veterans Administration Building in the District of Columbia (Vermont Avenue and H Street, N. W.). This was a one-year contract, commencing on June 1, 1966. From June 1, 1965, until May 31, 1966, this particular maintenance contract was performed by the Frugal Company (hereinafter \u201cFrugal\u201d), a sole proprietorship (Tr. 15). During this period the Government Service Employees Union, Local 536, affiliated with Building Service Employees\u2019 Union, AFL-CIO (hereinafter \u201cUnion\u201d) successfully organized Frugal\u2019s maintenance employees at this location. On March 28, 1966, Frugal and the Union signed a collective bargaining agreement which included a union-shop clause requiring union membership after thirty days of employment. As a result, on May 31, 1966, all of Frugal\u2019s employees were members of the Union (Board\u2019s Decision at 4).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">The GSA had become disenchanted with the quality of Frugal\u2019s cleaning operation. (Tr. 188, 204-5, 209, 330-31, 336.) Petitioner was told that Frugal, true to its name, was employing too small a work force and that it had let the building itself lapse into quite poor condition (Brief for Petitioner at 3; Tr. 37-38, 267, 274, 276, 285, 296-7, 331). In addition our petitioner was informed that it would probably need the use of a larger work force than Frugal had been employing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">Thus, between May 17, 1966, and June 1,1966, petitioner needed to hire approximately seventy employees. The GSA suggested that it was \u201cindustry custom and practice\u201d for the incoming contractor to hire the employees of the outgoing contractor as a group. Tri State, however, decided that it would require individual applications from each of Frugal\u2019s employees who wished to continue working at the Veterans Administration Building. Petitioner then selected one Richard Turner, the very man that GSA felt was largely responsible for the poor condition of the building (Tr. 209, 296-97, 336), to distribute applications throughout the building. There is a great deal of conflict in the testimony adduced at the administrative hearing as to the availability and access of these applications (Tr. 47, 77, 169-70, 219, 245). The Board concluded that Tri State purposely limited their availability in an attempt to hire less than a majority of Frugal\u2019s employees and thus avoid having to deal with the Union (Board\u2019s Decision at 5, 6.). The end result, after a series of correspondence between the Union and the respondent, was that on June 1, 1966, respondent had hired only twenty-three of Frugal\u2019s forty or more employees. More specifically, on the afternoon of June 1, 1966, mass confusion reigned at the Veterans Administration Building.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Frugal employees set up picket lines and several Frugal employees tried to go to work and were told to wait for interviews (Tr. 102-03, 156, 170). The Union then filed a charge with the Board and a complaint was issued on August 31, 1966, alleging violation of Section 8(a) (1) and (3) of the Act.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On November 3, 1966, the trial examiner allowed the complaint to be amended to allege that Tri State also violated Section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>8(a) (5) of the Act.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On December 19, 1966, the trial examiner issued his decision which found that respondent had violated Section 8(a) (5) but that it had not violated Section 8(a) (1) and (3). Subsequent thereto the Board adopted the examiner\u2019s findings of fact<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> but concluded that the respondent did violate Section 8(a) (1) and (3). The Board refused to reach the question of whether Section 8(a) (5) was violated since it was largely moot and unnecessary for the Board\u2019s determination (Board\u2019s Decision at 7, 8). Thus, as its remedy the Board ordered backpay from June 1, 1966, until August 17, <em>1966,</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>for all Frugal employees who occupied such status on May 31, 1966, and who were not hired by respondent on June 1, 1966 (Board\u2019s Order at 8). It is from this Decision and Order that petitioner now seeks relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">We feel that the Board bottomed its decision on two separate and distinct bases. Thus, the Board ruled that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-7\">[b]y refusing to hire employees of the Frugal Company <em>as a group, </em>Respondent (Tri State) committed an unfair labor practice within the meaning of Section 8(a) (3) and (1) of the Act. * * * (Emphasis added.)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">In the long history of labor law in this jurisdiction there simply is no authority which would require a maintenance corporation which contracts to service a building for a one year period to hire \u201cen masse\u201d the entire work force employed by the corporation or sole proprietor which or who had contracted to service the building for the previous one year period. <em>See </em>Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America v. NLRB, 112 U.S.App.D.C. 252, 302 F.2d 186 (1962) ; Piasecki Aircraft Corp. v. NLRB, 280 F.2d 575 (3rd Cir. 1960), cert. denied, 364 U.S. 933, 81 S.Ct. 380, 5 L.Ed.2d 365 (1961) ; NLRB v. New England Tank Industries, Inc., 302 F.2d 273 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 371 U.S. 875, 83 S.Ct. 147, 9 L.Ed.2d 114 (1962). Here, Tri State had no privity of contract with Frugal or Frugal\u2019s employees and it was not a \u201csuccessor employer\u201d that bought out the business of another. John Wiley &amp; Sons v. Livingston, 376 U.S. 543, 84 S.Ct. 909, 11 L.Ed.2d 898 (1964) ; Perma Vinyl Corp., 65 L.R.R.M. 1168 (NLRB, May 27, 1967). In fact, GSA expressed dissatisfaction at the work being done by the very people the Board would require petitioner to hire as a group (Tr. 272, 297). Tri State was clearly free to require individual applications which would seem almost essential for their bookkeeping process. It should be noted also that the \u201cindustry custom\u201d of hiring imposes no binding obligation on petitioner. Moreover, the Board retreats from this proposition in the last and summation paragraph in its brief before this court (Brief for Respondent at 15). To the extent that the National Labor Relations Board bases its Decision and Order on the proposition that a successor contractor must hire \u201cen masse\u201d or \u201cas a group\u201d the entire work force of its predecessor contractor, it must be disregarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b229-11\">The second ground for the Board\u2019s Decision is a finding that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>was Tri State\u2019s \u201cintent not to hire most of the Frugal employees because of their Union affiliation.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Thus, the Board ordered Tri State to cease and desist from</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-4\">[djiscouraging membership in Government Service Employees Union, Local 536 * * * by refusing to employ any applicant for employment * * * because of membership in, activities for, or sympathies with any such labor organization. * * *<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"ALD\">It is well settled that Frugal\u2019s employees were entitled to be considered for employment with Tri State on a non-discriminatory basis. Phelps Dodge Corp. v. NLRB, 313 U.S. 177, 61 S.Ct. 845, 85 L.Ed. 1271 (1941) ; K. B. &amp; J. Young\u2019s Super Markets, Inc. v. NLRB, 377 F.2d 463 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 389 U.S. 841, 88 S.Ct. 71, 19 L.Ed.2d 105 (1967). It is thus clear that petitioner did violate the Act if it, as the Board found it did, refused employment to Frugal\u2019s employees because of their union membership. It is with reference to this allegation that the record of the administrative hearing (as reproduced in the joint appendix) is not completely comprehensive. It is replete with incomplete testimony of the witnesses.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Nevertheless, our examination of this record reveals that the Board\u2019s finding, <em>id est, </em>that appellant refused employment to former Frugal employees because of their union membership, is supported by substantial evidence. Thus, we are bound by this determination even though we might have, were we permitted a de novo review, found a different result.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">Upon close and exhaustive inspection of the record below we learn that considerable testimony was adduced showing that many Frugal employees were unable to obtain applications upon request (Tr. 169-70, 245). The record shows that Tri State expressed anti-union animus several times during the contract negotiations (Tr. 315-16, 326-27). There was testimony revealing that Mr. Turner told many Frugal employees that only twenty-two would be retained and that Tri State did not want the Union there (Tr. 98, 99). There was testimony alleging that one employee was refused an application because of her union affiliation (Tr. 90). The testimony showed that Mr. Steube, a Tri State supervisor, told several Frugal employees that Tri State would pay union wages but didn\u2019t want any union there (Tr. 107, 160, 221, 223). There was testimony that all the allegedly valuable day-time employees were hired quickly but that the much more numerous and less valuable nighttime employees found that there was a dearth of both applications and information about how to apply for employment with Tri State (Tr. 47-49, 138). The record shows also that several Union officers told the Frugal employees that they would be fired or paid less by Tri State (Tr. 113-14, 346). The Board weighed all this conflicting evidence and we feel that its conclusion is supported by substantial evidence in the record. This portion of the Board\u2019s Decision will not be disturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-11\">We conclude therefore that the Frugal employees described in the Board\u2019s Order are entitled to back pay and it shall be awarded. The Board\u2019s Order as here modified is affirmed insofar as it is based upon the holding that our petitioner discriminated against the Frugal employees in its hiring process because of their union affiliation. We reject the Board\u2019s conclusion insofar as it requires <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>that Tri State hire the Frugal employees as a <em>growp. </em>The Board\u2019s Order is therefore</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">Affirmed as modified.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b228-7\">. The record reveals that Frugal\u2019s work force had dwindled to an average of between thirty-eight and forty-eight in the final few months of their contract (Tr. 331-32).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b228-8\">. The record reflects much dispute as to exactly what occurred at the Veterans Administration Building on June 1, 1966 (Tr. 101-03, 156-57, 169-71, 221-23, 247).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b228-9\">. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a) (1), (3) (1964), which reads in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-10\">(a) It shall be an unfair labor practice for an employer\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-11\">(1) to interfere with, restrain, or coerce employees in the exercise of the rights guaranteed in section 157 of this title * * * (3) by discrimination in regard to hire or tenure of employment * * * to * * * discourage membership in any labor organization * * *.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b229-12\">. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a) (5) (1964), which reads in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-13\">(a) It shall be an unfair labor practice for an employer\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-14\">(5) to refuse to bargain collectively with the representatives of his employees * * *.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b229-15\">.
