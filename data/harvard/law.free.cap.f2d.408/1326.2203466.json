We affirm the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1384-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1328\">*1328</page-number>Petitioner was indicted for first degree murder for fatally stabbing the man with whom she had been living. Four attorneys were assigned to defend her. The Supreme Court, Kings County, accepted a plea of guilty to first degree manslaughter and sentenced her to ten to twenty years imprisonment on March 18, 1963. Petitioner contends that her guilty plea was not voluntary under the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment. We must therefore review the events relating to the plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b1384-4\">On September 19, 1962, petitioner\u2019s four attorneys met in her absence with the district attorney and Judge Miles F. McDonald, who presided at all the state court proceedings. After a discussion of petitioner\u2019s extensive criminal record and the sentencing possibilities under a plea of guilty to first or second degree manslaughter, the judge stated that he would accept a guilty plea to first degree manslaughter or, if petitioner were a second felony offender, to second degree manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1384-5\">Defense counsel went to speak with petitioner and returned to inform the court that \u201c[f]or the first time, she says she is not guilty.\u201d Petitioner was sent for and the judge told her that she \u201cwould have considerable difficulty in taking the witness stand\u201d because her \u201crecord would come out.\u201d He then described the plea options discussed with her counsel and noted the range of permissible sentences, but did not promise any specific sentence. The judge told petitioner that she was not compelled to enter the guilty plea but that pleading guilty \u201cis an assurance for you to avoid serious consequences of a conviction for murder in the first degree.\u201d The judge then said: \u201cHowever, if you are not guilty, there is nothing that you can do, if you say you are not guilty.\u201d The judge went on to review the evidence against petitioner, stating that she told the district attorney that when the deceased kicked at her door, she got a knife, opened the door and stabbed him in the chest. The judge said he was making no recommendation, threat or promise except that he would reduce the plea to manslaughter in the second degree if defendant proved to be a second felony offender. He urged her to listen to the advice of her lawyers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1384-7\">After discussing the case with petitioner, her lawyers returned and one of them, Gold, said: \u201cNothing doing, Judge; she has changed her mind [and will not plead guilty].\u201d Gold suggested that petitioner be sent to a hospital for psychiatric observation. The court called her and informed her of Gold\u2019s doubts about her mental health. She responded sensibly to the court\u2019s questions about the .case and said: \u201cThere is nothing wrong with me.\u201d The court refused to commit her for observation and remanded her for trial on her plea of not guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b1384-8\">On December 12 petitioner appeared before the court with two of her lawyers, Seligman and Kooper, for the purpose of withdrawing her plea of not guilty and pleading guilty to first degree manslaughter. The court accepted the plea upon the prosecution\u2019s recommendation and told the clerk to take the plea. The clerk asked petitioner whether she had discussed the case with her lawyers and whether she understood that Seligman had stated that she would plead guilty to first degree manslaughter; she answered both questions affirmatively. However, when the clerk asked if she wished to plead guilty, petitioner at first did not respond and, when the question was repeated by Seligman, she answered \u201cNo.\u201d The following exchange then took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1384-9\">\u201cThe Court: What do you mean \u2018No?\u2019 Listen to me, Miss Bullock. I was told that you wanted to take this plea. This is all I consented to do here. You don\u2019t have to take it if you don\u2019t want it. If you don\u2019t intend to plead, say so and go back and await a trial. You are not being compelled to do it if you are not doing it wilfully. But don\u2019t mislead your lawyers and don\u2019t mislead me and then when you get here change your mind. This is your last opportunity. Either you plead or you go to trial. What do you want to do ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1385-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1329\">*1329</page-number>The Defendant: I want to take a plea.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1385-4\">Mr. Seligman: She did not understand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1385-5\">The Court: Would you explain it to her? If it turns out that she was a second felony offender and was previously convicted of a felony in New Jersey \u2014 perhaps maybe she is not\u2014 then I will further reduce the plea to Manslaughter in the second degree. But if she is a first offender, she is going to stand with Manslaughter in the first rather than in the second degree.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1385-6\">The Defendant: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1385-7\">The Court: Now, do' you desire to plead guilty to the crime of Manslaughter in the first degree, unarmed? Now, if you are not doing this willingly, don\u2019t do it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1385-8\">The Defendant: I don\u2019t understand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1385-9\">The Court: Do you plead guilty to Manslaughter in the first degree, unarmed ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1385-10\">The Defendant: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1385-11\">The Court: Has any promise been made to you or have you been threatened in any way by the Court, the District Attorney, the Clerk of the Court or anyone connected with the Court to induce you to offer this plea ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1385-12\">The Defendant: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1385-13\">The Court: Are you pleading guilty of your own free will ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1385-14\">The Defendant: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1385-15\">The Court: Do you know that by your plea of guilty you admit that you committed the crime of Manslaughter in the first degree, unarmed, to which you plead guilty ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1385-16\">The Defendant: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1385-17\">The Court: And you plead guilty because you are guilty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1385-18\">The Defendant: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1385-19\">The Court: Remanded.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1385-20\">At sentencing on March 18, 1963, the court determined that petitioner was not a second felony offender. Seligman argued for mitigation of punishment on the ground that the deceased had frequently mistreated her and that, when he became violent at her door, she had grabbed a knife to protect herself. The court imposed a ten to twenty year sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1385-23\">The following day the judge held a hearing, with Seligman present, at which petitioner was called and told that the judge had inadvertently failed to follow his usual practice of asking the defendant before imposing sentence whether she had had a fair opportunity to confer with counsel, whether she had been afforded all her rights, whether she had been coerced in any way and whether any promises made by the court had been broken. This colloquy then occurred :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1385-24\">\u201cThe Court: Now is there any reason you have to believe that you were not afforded all of your rights in connection with this matter?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1385-26\">The Defendant: I took a plea because \u2014 \u25a0</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1385-27\">The Court: I\u2019m not asking you why you took the plea, I want to know whether you were afforded every right to which you were entitled and if you have any complaints to make; not why you took the plea. That was between you and your lawyer; you discussed that with him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1385-28\">Do you want to talk to your lawyer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1385-29\">(No response.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1385-30\">Have you any complaints?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1385-31\">The Defendant: Yes, I have a complaint.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1385-32\">The Court: What is it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1385-33\">The Defendant: Well, this man was kicking my door down; I had no intention to kill him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1385-34\">The Court: Have you got any complaints about the Court?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1385-35\">The Defendant: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1385-36\">The Court: All right, that\u2019s all I wanted to know.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1385-37\">Five weeks after sentencing, petitioner wrote to the court to \u201cappeal\u201d her case. She stated that, although she had expressed a belief in her innocence to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1330\">*1330</page-number>Seligman, he had advised her to plead guilty because she would then be \u201cat the mercy of the court\u201d and would receive \u201cless time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1386-4\">The letter was treated as an application for a writ of error coram nobis and a hearing was held on June 24, 1963, before Judge McDonald. Petitioner testified that she had never told her lawyers that she was guilty, although she admitted that she had swung her hand with a knife in it when the deceased came to her door. She also testified that she had told Seligman about the facts of the case and that he advised her that she would \u201cget a light sentence\u201d if she pleaded guilty and would serve only about 2y2-3% years before being paroled. She stated that Seligman had not discussed with her the law of self-defense. Seligman had died by the time of the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1386-5\">At the end of the hearing the court denied the application upon a finding that the plea had been voluntary. It declared that Seligman\u2019s statement concerning the sentence had been an \u201cestimate\u201d and not a \u201cpromise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1386-6\">The Appellate Division affirmed the order below without opinion, 24 A.D.2d 843, 263 N.Y.S.2d 697 (1965), and leave to appeal to the Court of Appeals was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1386-7\">Petitioner then made a pro se application for a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York. She alleged that she had been \u201cfrightened into taking a guilty plea\u201d and reasserted her claim that Seligman had made a sentence promise. Without holding a hearing or assigning counsel, the district court denied the writ. Petitioner appeals from that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1386-8\">The conduct of petitioner\u2019s lawyers was not coercive. Their advice that she plead guilty to first degree manslaughter rather than go to trial on a charge of first degree murder may have been sound in view of the evidence against her. The suggestion that she be committed for mental observation constituted an attempt to establish a defense; it cannot reasonably be construed as a threat designed to compel a plea of guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b1386-10\">Petitioner\u2019s allegation that Seligman promised a \u201clight sentence\u201d and parole after 2y2-3% years was first made at the coram nobis hearing held after Seligman\u2019s death. Her letter to the court which led to the hearing asserted only that Seligman had told her that she would be \u201cat the mercy of the court\u201d and would receive \u201cless time.\u201d Moreover, at the hearing she admitted that her only complaint was that she had received a longer sentence than Seligman told her she had reason to expect. On the basis of this full and fair hearing the court found that Seligman had made an \u201cestimate\u201d and not a promise concerning the the sentence. Its finding is clearly supported by the record and should be accepted by this court. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d) (Supp. III 1965-67) ; Townsend v. Sain, 372 U.S. 293, 83 S.Ct. 745, 9 L.Ed.2d 770 (1963). An erroneous sentence estimate by defense counsel does not render a plea involuntary. See United States v. Horton, 334 F.2d 153, 155 (2d Cir. 1964) (motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (1964)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1386-11\">Nor was the conduct of the court coercive. Throughout the proceedings the judge assured petitioner that she was free to plead as she wished. His participation in the plea discussions did not, in itself, coerce petitioner. See United States ex rel. Rosa v. Follette, 395 F.2d 721, 725 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 393 U.S. 892, 89 S.Ct. 216, 21 L.Ed.2d 172 (1968). His review of her situation was intended to assist her in making an informed choice as to her plea. The fact that the information given to her by the judge may have influenced her to plead guilty, rather than to seek acquittal on the ground of self-defense, does not establish that the judge\u2019s statements were coercive. See United States ex rel. McGrath v. LaVallee, 348 F.2d 373, 376 (2d Cir. 1965), cert. denied sub nom. McGrath v. McMann, 383 U.S. 952, 86 S.Ct. 1214, 16 L.Ed.2d 214 (1966). As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1331\">*1331</page-number>petitioner had ample opportunity to consider the statements by the court and her lawyers\u2019 advice before she made her plea, the court\u2019s impatience with her at the time it was made did not render it involuntary. Petitioner\u2019s expression of confusion, when called upon to plead, should perhaps have prompted the judge to inquire into the nature of the confusion, but her answers to his questions clearly indicated that she wished to plead guilty and understood the consequences of doing so'. The court\u2019s unwillingness to hear petitioner\u2019s explanation of her reasons for pleading guilty was not prejudicial in view of its efforts to assure that the plea was made voluntarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b1387-5\">Petitioner\u2019s plea was not \u201cthe product of coercion, either mental or physical\u201d and was not \u201cunfairly obtained or given through ignorance, fear or inadvertence * * United States ex rel. McGrath v. LaVallee, supra, 348 F.2d at 376.</p>\n<p id=\"b1387-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
