Torrence\u2019s death was alleged to have been caused by the negligence of the captain, crew, or owner of the M/V Mariner,, owned and operated by the appellee. Other defendants were dismissed from the case and are not parties to this appeal. Jurisdiction of the instant claim is based on diversity of citizenship and the issues were submitted to a jury upon special interrogatories.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-4\">On February 25, 1966, at about 12:15 A.M., fourteen barges in the tow of the Mariner broke loose while the tow was maneuvering around a bend in the Mississippi River at Thomas Point, above Baton Rouge, Louisiana.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-5\">Over two hours after the breakaway and between seven and ten miles downriver, Torrence, the deceased, engaged in an attempt to capture one of the barges. Ultimately, the tug. he was piloting, together with the barge he was attempting to recover, collided with the anchor chains of another vessel. With the tug rapidly taking on water, Torrence jumped into the river and was never found.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-6\">Several written interrogatories covering the various issues in the case were submitted to the jury. However, the jury answered only one, the first, which read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b930-7\">Q. Was the captain or crew or owner or any representative or agent of the owner of M/V Mariner guilty of negligence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b930-8\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b930-9\">As grounds for reversal, appellant asserts that (1) the trial court erred in failing to give an instruction regarding the rescuer doctrine, (2) the trial court erred in failing to give an instruction regarding unseaworthiness, (8) the jury\u2019s verdict was a product of erroneous instructions regarding proximate cause, and (4) there was no evidence to support the jury\u2019s finding that Harrison, the captain of the Mariner, was not negligent.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ADP\">Because of the jury\u2019s disposition of the case, the scope of this Court\u2019s inquiry into the alleged errors raised by appellant is severely restricted. The jury, without reaching the doubtful proposition that Torrence\u2019s death was proximately caused by the fact of the breakaway, merely determined that Harrison was not negligent. We therefore need only examine appellant\u2019s contentions insofar as they relate to this issue.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AEOd\">The crux of appellant\u2019s case was that Harrison was negligent in that he knew or should have known of treacherous conditions at Thomas Point on the night in question and that these conditions would likely cause a breakaway if adequate precautionary measures were not taken. To demonstrate Harrison\u2019s alleged negligence, appellant primarily relies on Harrison\u2019s own testimony that he knew there would be some eddies at the bend; that they would extend three-fourths to seven-eighths from the center of the river; that he proceeded around the bend approximately one-quarter off the shore; and that had he <em>actually </em>known the severity of the conditions he would have waited until morning to make the trip.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b930-21\">At the outset, we must remain cognizant of the inherent dangers involved in piloting a vessel through navigable waters of the type here involved. A certain amount of risk is inevitable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>and everpresent and cannot be avoided. Countless thousands of lives have been claimed by the perils of the sea through the fault of no one. As this Circuit recently observed, a maritime accident may be \u201cunavoidably and accidently caused by a combination of prevailing wind, tide, and river currents.\u201d Standard Dredging Corp. v. Texaco, Inc., 395 F.2d 744, 745 (5 Cir. 1968). Upon this backdrop, we turn to the testimony of Harrison himself, an employee of the appellee since 1936, and a pilot since 1948.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b931-5\">Q. Could you tell us what was different about this night from all of the other times that you have been through with your tow?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b931-6\">A. I never seen the current as swift as it was that night, or the eddy working so hard as that night; it was boiling.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b931-7\">Q. What do you mean by boiling ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b931-8\">A. Well, I mean the river just kept boiling up and at the top making big \u2014 it starts out small, you see, and it keeps going and widens out, widens out until finally it hits where the current is, it is just like hitting a brick wall. I mean it just bunches together.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b931-9\">Q. Captain, during the time that you were going through Thomas Point before, and in all of your experience, have you ever had a tow break up before this time ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b931-10\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b931-11\">Q. Captain, truthfully, have you ever encountered current conditions or any conditions equal to or greater to the current conditions that you encountered at Thomas Point on the night of this accident?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b931-12\">A. No, sir, I don\u2019t believe that I have. I have hit some pretty hard currents, but I think that is the worst of the worst, I think.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b931-13\">Harrison had also testified regarding certain precautions he had taken prior to embarking on the trip.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-14\"> It is well settled that it is the jury\u2019s function to weigh the evidence and the credibility of the witnesses, Helene Curtiss Industries, Inc. v. Pruitt, 385 F.2d 841 (5 Cir. 1967), and that the jury\u2019s determination should not be disturbed if there was competent evidence in the record to support it.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In the instant case, the jury could have rationally concluded that the conditions were so extreme and unusual at the time and place in question that even an experienced captain would not and should not have foreseen the risk. This being the case, the verdict must stand. Concurrently, appellant\u2019s objections regarding other aspects of the case are without merit and fall of their own weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-15\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b930-10\">. Other possible negligence factors, such as improper securing of the barges to the Mariner, were not advanced in the lower court or on this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b930-11\">. While it is true that an erroneous refusal to give an unseaworthiness instruction would hear directly on the issue of initial fault, the record discloses that the trial court properly declined to give such an instruction. There was no evidence whatever of any causal connection between the alleged items of unseaworthiness and the breakaway. The only testimony adduced at trial on the point was to the contrary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b930-23\">. Appellant also emphasizes the fact that Harrison did not call ahead to pre-deter-mine the conditions at the bend. However, Harrison had testified that he was quite familiar with that portion of the river and, in any event, there was no competent evidence to show that such an inquiry would have been of avail.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"ayq-dedup-2\">.
