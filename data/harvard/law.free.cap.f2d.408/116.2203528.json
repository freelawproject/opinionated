Since federal jurisdiction here depends on diversity of citizenship, the applicable law must be determined by the choice of law rules of the forum state, North Carolina. Klaxon Co. v. Stentor Mfg. Co., 313 U.S. 487, 61 S.Ct. 1020, 85 L.Ed. 1477 (1941).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-22\">On September 13, 1965, William Bren-dle, a North Carolina resident, was injured in an accident in Lafayette County, Missouri, while he was driving a truck for his employer, a North Carolina corporation. He died a week later from his injuries. The accident allegedly was caused by a blowout of the truck\u2019s right front tire, which had been made in Ohio by the defendant, General Tire and Rubber Company, and had been sold to Brendle\u2019s employer in North Carolina by a North Carolina subsidiary of General Tire.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-23\">The plaintiff, as administratrix of Brendle\u2019s estate, sued General Tire to recover for the medical expenses and pain and suffering resulting from Bren-dle\u2019s injuries before death, and for his subsequent wrongful death. She stated two theories of recovery for each cause of action \u2014 negligent design and manufacture of the tire which blew out, and breach of the implied warranty of the tire\u2019s fitness for use.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-24\">General Tire moved for summary judgment on both causes of action. Its position was and is that since the accident occurred in Missouri, Missouri <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>law governs the suit. Under that state\u2019s law, there is no surviving cause of action for medical expenses or pain and suffering attributable to injuries which subsequently caused the tort victim\u2019s death.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> There is a cause of action for wrongful death, but under the Missouri statute the proper party to sue in this case would be the decedent\u2019s minor children rather than his personal representative.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Both of plaintiff\u2019s causes of action were therefore defective under Missouri law.</p>\n<p id=\"AfE\">The District Court concluded that the North Carolina Supreme Court would apply Missouri law to determine the controversy insofar as it involved questions of negligence since North Carolina adheres to the choice of law rule of <em>lex loci delicti </em>in tort actions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court therefore awarded summary judgment for General Tire on the portion of each cause of action alleging negligence. As to the remaining allegations of breach of warranty, the court denied summary judgment without prejudice to the defendant to renew its motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">From the entry of summary judgment as to negligence the plaintiff appeals.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> She concedes that summary judgment is proper if Missouri law is applicable, but she maintains that the District Court erred in concluding that a North Carolina court would apply Missouri law in the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">The appellant admits</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-8\">that in all decided cases of which we are aware, the North Carolina Court has in cases arising from motor vehicle accidents applied the law of the state where the accident occurred to determine the rights of the parties as to both liability and damages.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ad-dedup-0\">She advances the contention, however, that the present situation is distinguishable from the usual motor vehicle case. First, as she notes, any negligence of the present defendant occurred not in Missouri, where the accident took place, but in Ohio where the tire was made. Since the Missouri \u201crules of the road\u201d are therefore not relevant to the case, the appellant declares that there is no reason to apply Missouri law. Second, she points out that the case involves two different theories of recovery, negligence and breach of warranty, which are subject to inconsistent choice of law rules. In negligence cases, North Carolina courts apply the law of the place of the wrong. Petrea v. Ryder Tank Lines, Inc., 264 N.C. 230, 141 S.E.2d 278 (1965). In warranty cases, on the other hand, the applicable law is that of the state where the merchandise was sold, here North Carolina. Price v. Goodman, 226 N.C. 223, 37 S.E.2d 592 (1946). Under Missouri law \u2014 applicable to a negligence case \u2014 the plaintiff\u2019s complaint states no cause of action, while under North Carolina law \u2014 applicable to warranty questions \u2014 it states causes of action for both personal injury and wrongful death. The appellant therefore contends that a North Carolina court would resolve the inconsistency by holding that one state\u2019s law should govern the entire litigation. She argues that the appropriate governing law in this case would be that of North Carolina, which is not only the forum but also has the most significant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>contacts with the parties and transactions involved in the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">In presenting her argument, the appellant relies heavily on the opinion of this court in Lowe\u2019s North Wilkesboro Hardware, Inc. v. Fidelity Life Ins. Co., 319 F.2d 469 (4th Cir. 1963), another diversity suit in which North Carolina was the forum state. That case involved an alleged negligent delay by a Pennsylvania insurance company in acting upon an application for an insurance policy. While acknowledging our obligation to follow North Carolina\u2019s choice of law rules, we there noted that the North Carolina Supreme Court had never decided a case involving \u201cconsiderations analogous to the multi-state features presented here.\u201d 319 F.2d at 472. Accordingly, we concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-5\">[W]e find it most reasonable, in these circumstances, to avoid a rigid rule and to pursue instead a more flexible approach which would allow the court in each case to inquire which state has the most significant relationships with the events constituting the alleged tort and with the parties. <em>Id. </em>at 473.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">The plaintiff cogently argues that in the present case a similar approach would be adopted by the North Carolina court.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">Clearly, the present litigation is not an appealing one in which to apply the <em>lex loci </em>rule. Missouri has no real connection with either the alleged tortious conduct or the various parties involved in the litigation. It is the \u201cplace of the wrong\u201d only in the special sense that \u201cthe last event necessary to make an actor liable\u201d occurred in that state. The fact that the accident happened there was completely fortuitous. No Missouri traffic law was violated, and no Missouri resident was involved. The alleged negligence occurred in Ohio, and any damages awarded in the suit would be paid by an Ohio corporation. The decedent\u2019s estate is being administered in North Carolina, where his surviving dependents reside. Therefore, whether the purpose of tort law in this situation is to admonish the tortfeasor or to compensate the tort victims,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Missouri has no interest in having its law govern the case, and North Carolina has no reason to apply Missouri law rather than its own, the law of the forum.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-12\">Because Missouri law on the issues involved here differs from both North Carolina and Ohio law in a number of important respects, adherence to the <em>lex loci </em>rule would materially affect the results of the litigation. Missouri law requires a wrongful death action to be brought by the decedent\u2019s widow or minor children, limits recovery for wrongful death to $25,000 and bars recovery for the decedent\u2019s expenses and pain and suffering before death.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Under North Carolina or Ohio law, the decedent\u2019s personal representative is the proper party plaintiff in a wrongful death action, wrongful death damages are unlimited, and there is a surviving cause of action for the pre-death expenses and pain and suffering.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Missouri\u2019s more restrictive law thus clearly conflicts with the forum state\u2019s interest in assuring its residents, the decedent\u2019s dependents, adequate compensation for injury or death, and yet the result of applying Missouri law furthers no interest of that jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-13\">Faced with comparable factual situations, modern courts have shown a tendency to forego rigid adherence to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number><em>lex loci </em>rule.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The main advantage of the traditional rule, ease in determining the law to be applied, seems to afford an unconvincing reason for adhering to the rule, \u201csince it is obviously of greater importance that choice of law rules lead to desirable results.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In seeking desirable results, therefore, many courts have abandoned mechanical rules and have instead selected the appropriate law by relying on forum policy,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> analyzing governmental interests,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> or determining which state has \u201cthe most significant relationship\u201d with the litigated matter.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Whatever the difficulties attendant upon such flexible approaches to choice of law,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> courts are at least free to make a reasoned choice among potentially applicable rules of decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-11\">In Lowe\u2019s North Wilkesboro Hardware v. Fidelity Life Ins. Co., 319 F.2d 469 (1963), we addressed ourselves to a situation not clearly governed by any of North Carolina\u2019s traditional choice of law rules. We therefore concluded that the North Carolina Supreme Court, having regard for the modern trend, would likely apply the law of the state having \u201cthe most significant relationships with the events constituting the alleged tort and with the parties.\u201d 319 F.2d at 473. The test adopted in <em>Lowe\u2019s, </em>which is in essence that urged by the Restatement (Second) of Conflicts (Proposed Official Draft), requires a court to assess a state\u2019s contacts with a case in the light of the particular issues to be decided.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b176-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>In the present instance, the particular issues affected by the choice of law process are the survival of the cause of action for personal injuries, the proper party plaintiff for the wrongful death action, and the amount of damages recoverable for wrongful death. Since there is no conflict between the laws of North Carolina and Ohio on these issues, the relevant choice lies between North Carolina and Missouri law.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">As to all three issues, it seems clear that North Carolina has the most significant relationship with the parties and the events. The questions of survival and the proper party plaintiff primarily affect administration of the estate, which is proceeding in North Carolina.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The issue concerning limitation of damages most directly touches the compensation of the decedent\u2019s beneficiaries, who are North Carolina residents.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Although a limit on damages also protects defendants from excessive judgments, the defendant in this ease is an Ohio corporation which undoubtedly carries liability insurance in conformity with the Ohio statute allowing unlimited damages. By applying its own law to the ease, therefore, a North Carolina court would further the interests of its own residents without running counter to the reasonable expectations of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">Use of forum law, as the appellant urges, seems by far the more reasonable course. Unfortunately for the plaintiff\u2019s contention, however, we are not free to fashion our own choice of law rule, for we are bound by the decisions of the North Carolina Supreme Court. In <em>Lowe\u2019s, </em>we were presented with a factual situation and a legal question never faced by the North Carolina court, and we could conclude that it would have decided the case as we indicated, adopting a flexible approach in order to deal adequately with the special multi-state features of the case. Here, however, the North Carolina decisions clearly reveal the unqualified adherence of the North Carolina Supreme Court to the <em>lex loci </em>rule in cases involving personal injury or wrongful death, without regard to whether the accident involved a breach of local traffic rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-13\">In a personal injury case decided two years after our decision in <em>Lowe\u2019s, </em>the North Carolina Supreme Court specifically declined an invitation to abandon the <em>lex loci </em>rule and adopt the \u201cmost significant relationship\u201d test as set forth in <em>Lowe\u2019s.</em><footnotemark><em>17</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Similarly, in a recent wrongful death ease, the North Carolina court applied the law of the state where the fatal injury occurred although neither party to the suit was a resident of that state. Broadfoot v. Everett, 270 N.C. 429, 154 S.E.2d 522 (1967). In terms of the traditional rule, \u201cthe place of the wrong\u201d here complained of was Missouri, since the injuries were sustained there. See Farmer v. Ferris, 260 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>N.C. 619, 133 S.E.2d 492 (1963). The appellant has not persuaded us that the Supreme Court of North Carolina would be prepared to recognize a significant difference between this case and its above adjudications.</p>\n<p id=\"A5K\">It is therefore our obligation to follow the rule declared in those cases and apply Missouri law.</p>\n<p id=\"ASD\">The summary judgment must accordingly be</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b173-9\">.

The traditional <em>lex loci </em>rule is that tort actions are governed by the law of the place of the wrong, which is \u201cthe state where the last event necessary to make an actor liable for an alleged tort takes place.\u201d Restatement of Conflict of Laws \u00a7 377 (1934).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b173-15\">. Although a summary judgment affecting only part of a cause of action is not a \u201cfinal decision\u201d appealable under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, the District Court in this ease certified, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b), that a final determination of the issue by the Court of Appeals prior to trial would promote an orderly trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b174-8\">. It has been suggested that when a tort rule\u2019s primary purpose is to deter or punish misconduct, the state where the conduct took place may have the greatest interest in applying its own law, while if the purpose of a rule is primarily compensatory, the State where the plaintiff resides has the greater interest.
