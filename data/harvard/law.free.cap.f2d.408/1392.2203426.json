The issues tendered to the district court in appellant\u2019s last application under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 were encompassed in a prior petition on which a hearing was held and an order entered denying relief, which this court affirmed. Arellanes v. United States, 353 F.2d 270 (9th Cir. 1965), <em>affirming </em>238 F.Supp. 546 (N.D.Cal.1964). In these circumstances, appellant was entitled to a hearing on the present motion only upon a showing that the ends of justice would be served by a redetermi-nation of the issues. <em>See </em>Sanders v. United States, 373 U.S. 1, 17, 83 S.Ct. 1068, 10 L.Ed.2d 148 (1963). Although the opinion of the district court dismissing the motion is couched largely in other terms, it left no room to doubt that it was the district court\u2019s view that reliti-gation of the issues would not serve the ends of justice. That decision was within the district court\u2019s discretion <em>(see </em>Sanders v. United States, <em>supra, </em>at 18, 83 S.Ct. 1068), and will not be disturbed here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1448-22\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
