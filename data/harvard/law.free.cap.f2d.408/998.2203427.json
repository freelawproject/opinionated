We affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1055-19\">The appellant is a forty year old male who claims that he is unable to engage in substantial gainful activity. While in the army in 1953, the appellant was injured when he fell across some timbers which he was attempting to bind with a steel cable. In 1959 the appellant\u2019s stomach was removed due to an ulcer condition and an artificial stomach was constructed. The record is replete with evidence that the surgery was successful and that the appellant\u2019s period of recovery was normal and uneventful. Since his surgery, the appellant has frequented government hospitals with the same general complaints of arthritis, various aches and pains of the back and internal discomfort.</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-20\">As used in the Act disability means:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1055-21\">\u201c * * * inability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1000\">*1000</page-number>for a continuous period of not less than twelve months * * * \u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"ale-dedup-0\">If the record contains substantial evidence which supports the findings made by the Secretary, we must affirm. Section 205(g) of the Act, 42, U.S.C.A. \u00a7 405(g) ; Celebrezze v. O\u2019Brient, 5 Cir. 1963, 323 F.2d 989.</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-4\">The appellant presented no evidence other than his own self-serving testimony to support his contention that he was unable to engage in substantial gainful employment. Viewing the extensive medical evidence in the light most favorable to appellant, it shows no more than that he can not do heavy physical labor. There is no showing that he could not do the types of work which he had previously done, i. e., bartending, manning a cash register, or observing a rise grinding machine operate that he could stop by pushing a button. On the other hand there is substantial evidence in the record that in spite of the fact that his doctors have told appellant that he could work, the appellant has made up his mind that he will not do so. It is the appellant\u2019s attitude and not his aptitude which prevents him from engaging in gainful employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-5\">The appellant also asserts that no work of a reasonable character is available for him to do in his locality. This is of no avail. Work of a \u201creasonable character\u201d is not the proper criteria, nor is the job area confined to appellant\u2019s locality.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1056-12\">After a careful review of the record, including the administrative transcript, we agree with the District Court that the findings made by the Secretary are supported by substantial evidence and that the Secretary applied the proper legal standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-13\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"A1A\">. Under Rule 18 the Court has placed this case on the Summary Calendar for disposition without oral argument. See Floyd v. Resor, 5 Cir. 1969, 409 F.2d 714, n. 2 [February 24, 1969],</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1056-6\"><em>. </em>\u00a7 216 (i) of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 416 (i); \u00a7 223(d) (1) (A) of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 423(d) (1) (A).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1056-8\">. \u00a7 158(b) of the Act, 81 Stat. 821, provides among other things the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AVCf\">\u201c(2) For purposes of paragraph (1) (A) \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1056-10\">(A) An individual * * * shall be determined to be under a disability only if his physical or mental impairment are of such severity that he is not only unable to do his previous work but cannot, considering his age, education, and work experience, engage in any other kind of substantial gainful work which exists in the national economy, regardless of whether such work exists in the immediate area in which he lives, or whether a specific job vacancy exists for him, or whether he would be hired if he applied for work.
