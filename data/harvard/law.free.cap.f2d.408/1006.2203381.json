Avery Crary, United States District Judge, Central District of California, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"AOr\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"A8dH\">The Board has submitted a judgment for our approval, pursuant to our decision in this case (NLRB v. Harrah\u2019s Club, 9 Cir., 1968, 403 F.2d 865). Respondent objects on two grounds, first, that the judgment is premature, and second, that portions of the proffered judgment are overly broad. See Rule 19, Fed.R.App.Proc.</p>\n<p id=\"Ap9\">The argument that the judgment is premature rests upon the fact that we djd not specifically direct the enforcement of any part of the Board&gt;s order, but rather stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1063-15\">\u201cThe case is remanded for hearing of respondent\u2019s objections filed in the representation election proceedings. However, the other issues have also been decided to avoid the necessity of another appeal to this court involving these issues should the objections of respondent to the election be ultimately overruled and dismissed by the Board.\u201d (403 F.2) at 875.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1063-16\">One issue in no way depends upon the result of the further hearing, the finding that two employees had been discriminatorily discharged in violation of section 8(a) (1) and (3). A second issue does depend, in part, on the result of the hearing, the finding that discontinuance of \u201ctoking\u201d was both discriminatorily motivated (violating section 8(a) (3)) and a failure to bargain collectively about a mandatory subject (violating section 8(a) (5)). The failure to bargain charge rests upon the validity of the election. The Board\u2019s proffered judgment would reach the violations stemming from the discharges and would also require respondent both to make the employees whole for lost tokes and to reinstate the toking system. We see problems in the Board\u2019s proposal that we enter a judgment which directs reinstatement of toking before the representation issues are resolved. If the Board decides that respondent\u2019s objections to the election are valid, respondent could bar the toking practice as a matter of sincere and genuine business judgment unrelated to union activity. But in that event our immediate entry of judgment directing reinstatement would have an unknown effect on respondent\u2019s future, legitimate exercise of its busi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1008\">*1008</page-number>ness judgment. We will not now enter that part of the Board\u2019s proffered judgment. See NLRB v. Kelly &amp; Picerne, Inc., 1 Cir., 1962, 298 F.2d 895, 899.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-4\">Accordingly, only the portion of the order relating to discriminatory discharges and to an award for lost \u201ctokes\u201d is unaffected by our decision to remand. Here another consideration enters. Because this portion of the order is so small, \u201cin the interest of clarity we will deny the petition for enforcement <em>in toto, </em>and leave it to the Board, if so advised, to enter an order [on remand] consistent with our opinion[s].\u201d NLRB v. News Syndicate Co., 2 Cir., 1960, 279 F.2d 323, 334, aff\u2019d, 1961, 365 U.S. 695, 81 S.Ct. 849, 6 L.Ed.2d 29. We think that one complete order will be better than successive partial orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-5\">We do not reach respondent\u2019s second objection. We do note, however, that if the case were not remanded, NLRB v. Ochoa Fertilizer Corp., 1961, 368 U.S. 318, 82 S.Ct. 344, 7 L.Ed.2d 312, may have barred a number of respondent\u2019s claims. See also NLRB v. Seine and Line Fishermen\u2019s Union of San Pedro, 9 Cir., 1967, 374 F.2d 974, 980 ; Cascade Employers\u2019 Association v. NLRB, 9 Cir., 1968, 404 F.2d 490.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-8\">The case is remanded to the Board for proceedings in accordance with this opinion and our prior opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
