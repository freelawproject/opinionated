Since the issue is essentially legal in nature, only so much of the technology of the instant invention and of the reference as is necessary to relate the facts will be discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1450-4\">On September 15, 1961, Dewey filed an application describing and claiming a time delay \u201cProtective Device\u201d for an electric circuit. In discussing \u201cgating means 19,\u201d <em>Dewey\u2019s original application completely described the invention now claimed by Mathews, </em>a co-worker of Dewey, and concluded that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1450-5\">Those skilled in the art will understand that this same function could be accomplished by means other than the particular gating means 19 which has been illustrated by way of example, and such particulars form no part of my invention.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1450-6\">Thus, Dewey\u2019s patent, which issued on the aforementioned application, contains a <em>full </em>disclosure of the invention now claimed by Mathews together with the above-quoted statement and reference to a switch actuation technique which \u201cmay also be used in lieu of the illustrated gating means 19 to perform the gating function.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1450-7\">On March 7, 1963, before Dewey\u2019s patent was issued but almost 18 months after Dewey had filed, Mathews filed the instant application describing and claiming a \u201cLevel Detector and Switch\u201d which is used to control a switching transistor through which a load circuit may be connected to a power source. The application states that \u201c[o]ne illustration of a circuit embody the present invention is shown in a copending patent application S.N. 138, 476-Dewey\u201d and that \u201c[a] more specific embodiment of the load circuit 44 is disclosed in detail in the copending Dewey application.\u201d Mathews\u2019 application and the Dewey patent are both assigned to the General Electric Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b1450-12\">Using the Dewey patent as a reference, the examiner rejected all of Mathews\u2019 claims under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(e). In response thereto, and under the provisions of Rule 132, Mathews submitted Dewey\u2019s affidavit, the pertinent passages of which read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1450-13\">7. That he [Dewey], being the patentee of the aforementioned patent, did not conceive, make, or invent the specific circuit referred to in paragraph 6 above [Mathews\u2019 invention as described in Dewey] and did not know of it prior to the disclosure referred to in paragraph 8 below;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1450-14\">8. That the applicant Charles A. Mathews disclosed the circuit referred to in paragraph 6 above which circuit is the subject matter of the subject application, to him while a protective device embodying the invention of the aforementioned patent was being developed ;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1450-15\">9. That the circuit referred to in paragraph 6 was included in the specification of his patent to comply with the requirements of 35 U.S.C. 112, under the advice of General Electric Patent Attorneys;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1450-16\">10. That he did not, in his application which matured into Patent 3,105,-920, nor does he now claim the circuit referred to in paragraph 8 above;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1450-17\">11. That he expressly disclaimed being the inventor of that circuit (see column 3, lines 52-56 of the aforementioned patent); * * *.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1450-19\">Mathews has submitted no affidavit under Rule 131.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1451-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1395\">*1395</page-number>The statutory basis for the examiner\u2019s rejection reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1451-5\">\u00a7 102. <em>Conditions for patentability; novelty and loss of right to patent</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1451-7\">A person shall be entitled to a patent unless\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1451-8\">*****</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1451-9\">(e) the invention was described in a patent granted on an application for patent by another filed in the United States before the invention thereof by the applicant for patent, * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1451-10\">Section 102 sets forth enumerated criteria, each of which falls under one of the two specified \u201cconditions for pa-tentability,\u201d in the section title, namely, \u201cnovelty\u201d and \u201closs of right.\u201d The legislative history and prior cases show that subsection (e) is directed to a criterion relating to the requirement for <em>novelty. </em>See In re Land, 368 F.2d 866, 54 CCPA 806 (1966). It necessarily follows that Dewey may not be relied upon to defeat Mathews\u2019 application since Dewey\u2019s disclosure, <em>in view of the facts established in the record, </em>is not inconsistent with the novelty of Mathews\u2019 claimed invention. That is, <em>on the record here, </em>Dewey derived his knowledge from Mathews who is \u201cthe original, first, and sole inventor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1451-11\">The Congressional intent behind 35 U.S.C. 102(e) is clear as expressed in both the House and Senate reports<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> on the parallel bills which were enacted into the present law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1451-14\">Paragraph (e) is new and enacts the rule of [Alexander] Milburn [Co.] v. Davis-Bournonville [Co.], 270 U.S. 390 [46 S.Ct. 324, 70 L.Ed. 651], by reason of which a United States patent disclosing an invention dates from the date of filing the application for the purpose of anticipating a <em>subsequent </em>inventor. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1451-15\">That statement is in the \u201cRevision Notes\u201d forming part of the Appendix to the reports, and it follows a statement,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> under the \u201cGeneral Description of the Bill,\u201d which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1451-16\">Subsection (e) is another well-recognized condition imposed by a decision of the Supreme Court which was not expressed in the existing law [meaning \u201cstatute\u201d]; for the purpose of anticipating <em>subsequent </em>inventors, a patent disclosing the subject matter speaks from the filing date of the application disclosing the subject matter. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1451-17\">Thus, the origin of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(e) is the 1926 Supreme Court decision in Alexander Milburn Co. v. Davis-Bournonville Co., supra, an infringement suit based on a patent to Whitford granted June 4, 1912, on an application filed March 4, 1911. The validity of the Whitford patent was attacked on the basis of a patent to Clifford granted February 6, 1912, on an application filed in the United States on January 31, 1911, which described but did not claim Whit-ford\u2019s invention. <em>After </em>noting that \u201c[t]here was no evidence carrying Whitford\u2019s invention further back\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> than his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1396\">*1396</page-number>filing date, the Court held that the existence of Clifford\u2019s <em>earlier filed </em>United States application containing a disclosure of Whitford\u2019s invention <em>indicated </em>that <em>Whitford was not the first inventor. </em>That is the <em>Milburn </em>\u201crule\u201d which Congress intended to codify in enacting 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b1452-4\">Consistent with the <em>Milburn </em>\u201crule,\u201d we agree that the Dewey patent \u201cindicates\u201d or is <em>prima facie </em>evidence that Mathews was not the first inventor. But here, unlike <em>Milburn, </em>there is further evidence, uncontroverted by the Patent Office, that Mathews was not only the <em>first </em>inventor but also the <em>only </em>inventor, <em>so far as the record shows. </em>Dewey\u2019s affidavit <em>and </em>Mathews\u2019 oath accompanying his application are sufficient, we feel, to prove that the relevant disclosure in Dewey was a disclosure of <em>Mathews\u2019 </em>invention. The Dewey disclosure relied on, being a disclosure of Mathews\u2019 own invention, does not establish lack of novelty of Mathews\u2019 claimed invention. Cf. In re Blout, 333 F.2d 928, 52 CCPA 751 (1964). As this court said in In re Land, supra, at 368 F.2d 879, 54 CCPA 824-825:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1452-5\">When the 102(e) reference patentee got knowledge of the applicant\u2019s invention from him, as by being associated with him, * * * and <em>thereafter </em>describes it, he necessarily files the application <em>after </em>the applicant\u2019s invention date and the patent as a \u201creference\u201d does not evidence that the invention, when made, was already known to others. [Footnote omitted.]. Evidence of such a state of facts, whatever its form, must be considered. [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1452-7\"> The Patent Office\u2019s contention that appellant must comply with Rule 131 is not persuasive since we have already pointed out in <em>In re Land, </em>supra, that a Rule 131 affidavit is not the only way of antedating a reference. The solicitor has cited no precedent in support of his position that a reference patent may only be antedated by a Rule 131 affidavit, or even referred generally to the authorities previously cited by the examiner or board. So far as we have been advised, there is no such precedent to the effect that a Rule 131 affidavit is the <em>only </em>way to overcome a reference cited to evidence lack of novelty. We do not read Pierce v. Watson, 107 U.S.App.D.C. 226, 275 F.2d 890 (1960), relied on by the board, as requiring any other conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1452-9\">The decision of the board is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"A8qq\">Reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1452-11\">Judge Smith participated in the hearing of this case but died before a decision was reached.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"Am_q\">.
