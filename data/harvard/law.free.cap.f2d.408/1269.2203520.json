United States, 121 U.S.App.D.C. 151, 348 F.2d 763 (1965). In that case we construed the statute in this jurisdiction relating to impeachment of the credibility of witnesses in judicial proceedings by means of prior criminal conviction (14 D.C.Code \u00a7 305 (1967)) to be less than automatic in its operation, and to accord the trial court latitude to deny or limit such impeachment in a particular case if it thought the integrity of the truth seeking process would be correspondingly enhanced. An unsuccessful attempt to invoke the trial court\u2019s discretion often foreshadows an appellate claim of abuse said to require reversal. Such is the case here, for counsel presses upon us a claim that the judge below abused his <em>Luck </em>discretion. Counsel newly appointed for this appeal, however, has broadened the attack by urging that, at least as applied to the criminal defendant in this case, the statute is unconstitutional. For the reasons appearing hereinafter, we do not reach the merits of this latter contention, and appraising the trial court\u2019s action solely in terms of discretion, we find no abuse necessitating reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1326-15\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1326-16\">The Government\u2019s case was strong indeed. The robbery victim testified that, having just left a restaurant in downtown Washington, he was accosted by two men who demanded his money. Even though he said he had none, the two men closed in on him in order to take his watch, which the victim claimed one of the two had noticed. The victim started shouting, but was beaten into semi-consciousness. He testified that his watch, which was never found, was taken forcibly from him. He identified appellant as one of his assailants.</p>\n<p id=\"b1326-17\">The proprietor of the restaurant testified to hearing screams outside his place of business, and of going out the door and seeing the complainant lying on the ground with two' men near him. One of these, said to be the appellant, appeared to be in the act of removing his foot from the victim. When the witness asked the two men what they were doing, they ran. The proprietor bluffed appellant into stopping by pretending to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1271\">*1271</page-number>have a gun, but appellant, upon realizing he had been tricked, ran again, only to be caught by the proprietor when appellant lost his balance and fell. A police officer testified that, arriving upon the scene (which still included the victim lying in one of the doorways to the restaurant), he arrested appellant for robbery in light of the account given him by the restaurant proprietor of what had taken place.</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-5\">With the Government\u2019s case complete, appellant\u2019s counsel asked the court to exercise its <em>Luck </em>discretion and permit appellant to testify free of impeachment by prior conviction. The court was invited to hear appellant\u2019s story out of the presence of the jury. The court refused to do so, and counsel thereupon made a proffer on the record that appellant would have testified that \u201che was set upon and was chased and that there is either a case of mistaken identity or they have gotten the wrong man.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The prosecutor, presumably convinced that the Government\u2019s case would wither away in the blast of this story by appellant, insisted upon impeaching appellant by prior convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-6\">The court excluded a 1961 Maryland assault conviction proposed to be shown by the Government, but it concluded to permit use of a 1962 robbery conviction. After conferring with appellant, defense counsel stated that appellant would not testify if impeached, and asked the judge to reconsider. The trial judge did not relent. Appellant did not testify, nor did anyone else on his behalf. The jury\u2019s verdict of guilty was forthcoming promptly.</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-11\">The representations made to the trial court as to why it should deny impeachment by means of the prior robbery conviction included claims that (1) the five-year age of that conviction made it too remote in point of time to have significance and (2) it was inappropriate for such use because appellant was sentenced under the Youth Corrections Act. As to the former, we have remarked hitherto the relevance of the factor of remoteness to an informed discretion in this area, but we are unable to say that the \u2022 five-year span here involved placed the robbery conviction beyond the pale. The second point raises quite different considerations, but, on the facts of this record, we cannot say that the circumstance of the sentence under the Youth Corrections Act placed this robbery conviction outside the ambit of those con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1272\">*1272</page-number>templated by Congress in the impeachment statute.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1328-4\">Most of the discussion at trial centered around the defense contention that the robbery conviction should not be used because it did not bear upon veracity. The Government, conversely, argued that robbery involves stealing, that stealing bears upon veracity, and that, since appellant was denying guilt, the robbery conviction was relevant to the credibility of that denial. The court dealt with the question of the robbery conviction at length, and articulated with some care the basis for its ruling. It quite correctly took note of the special problems raised by prior convictions for the same crime as the one for which a defendant is currently on trial \u2014 problems which it thought might be ameliorated by admitting only one such prior conviction, as was. the case here. On the question of whether robbery has any implications for veracity, the court fairly and accurately identified our comments on the subject in <em>Gordon, supra </em>note 1, and expressly relied upon them. We think it was entitled to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-5\">It was, lastly, urged upon the trial court that appellant\u2019s testimony was of such a nature that the jury might reach an unjust verdict if it did not hear it. We have in the record, of course, only trial counsel\u2019s brief characterization of what that testimony would be, but we have no reason to believe that counsel summarized it inaccurately or failed to put it in its best light. Such as it was, it was all appellant had. And, so long as we subscribe to the principle and practice that, in our deep-seated horror of convicting the innocent, the Government may always be put to its proof that the accused is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, one may wonder what governmental interest was served by keeping appellant\u2019s story from the ears of the jury by insisting upon the identification of its narrator as one with a criminal past. But, on this- record, we cannot say that the shadow of possible error lay So darkly over these proceedings that this conviction must be reversed because of the court\u2019s failure to let appellant tell his story without being impeached by his prior conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-9\">We are, thus, not persuaded by that branch of appellant\u2019s challenge which is rooted in the concept of trial court discretion. An appellate claim of abuse by a trial judge in an area where his first-hand impressions are important has always \u2014 and rationally so \u2014 an uphill road to travel.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This was not unknown to this court when it decided <em>Luck, </em>but <em>Luck </em>did make available to' the trial judge an alternative which it had been assumed for fifty years he never had, namely the power to deny the weapon of impeachment to the prosecution in a case where the judge believes that the jury ought to have a chance to hear the defendant\u2019s story.</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-10\">The degree of utilization of that power will inevitably vary with the temperament and attitudes of the individual judge \u2014 a phenomenon hardly peculiar to trial judges, as distinct from their appellate brethren. Appellate restraint in this area should, however, be matched by an intent on the part of the trial judge not to approach every <em>Luck </em>determination with an implacable purpose always to permit impeachment. <em>Luck </em>has endowed the trial judge with a new resource of flexibility in conducting the search for truth. It is to be administered by reference to' that objective.</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1273\">*1273</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-5\">Appellant has, in this court, gone beyond the discretionary issue raised at trial and asked us to invalidate the statute as constitutionally deficient.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As a justification for mounting the constitutional attack nowhere expressly countenanced in <em>Luck, </em>he points to a supervening circumstance in the form of the Supreme Court\u2019s recent strictures upon the effectiveness of limiting instructions. Bruton v. United States, 391 U.S. 123, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476 (1968). That case did not involve impeachment by prior conviction but, rather, the effect upon one defendant of the introduction of a co-defendant\u2019s confession. The court reexamined and revised its earlier assumption in Delli Paoli v. United States, 352 U.S. 232, 77 S.Ct. 294, 1 L.Ed.2d 278 (1957), that it is \u201c \u2018reasonably possible for the jury to follow\u2019 sufficiently clear instructions to disregard the confessor\u2019s extrajudicial statement that his co-defendant participated with him in committing the crime,\u201d and embraced the completely contrary rationale in these words:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1329-6\">[Tjhere are some contexts in which the risk that the jury will not, or cannot, follow instructions is so great, and the consequences of failure so vital to the defendant, that the practical and human limitations cannot be ignored.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AnN\">391 U.S. at 126, 135, 88 S.Ct. at 1622, 1627 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-13\">Our statute may or may not be properly viewed in such a context.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> But the jury\u2019s capacity to discriminate between a prior conviction as impeaching veracity, on the one hand, and as indicating a criminal propensity probative of guilt of the crime immediately charged, on the other, appears to have bulked large in the Congressional election to enact \u00a7 305 in the first place. That law in terms limits the purpose of admitting prior convictions to effect upon credibility, and it is as a necessary consequence of that statutory limitation that there has been rigid judicial definition and enforcement of a duty upon the trial judge to give careful and complete instruction to the jurors that they must not consider the evidence as bearing upon guilt. If the psychological foundations for that instruction are inadequate, as the Supreme Court finds them to be in the circumstances of <em>Bru-ton, </em>then the constitutional status of the statute has perhaps been beclouded.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1330-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1274\">*1274</page-number>We do not, as said above, accept appellant\u2019s invitation to weigh the statute in the constitutional balance in this case. On this record, even if we were to regard the issue as appropriately before us for resolution and, further, even if we were to find the statute wanting, no benefit could accrue to appellant. No finding of constitutional error in the respect in question could, on this record, overcome our belief that such error would, beyond any reasonable doubt, be harmless. Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b1330-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1330-5\">APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b1330-6\">Twenty-four cases appear to have reached this court since <em>Luck </em>in which the issue of impeachment by prior conviction has been raised on appeal and discussed in an opinion. Since <em>Luck </em>there was a period in which the court was affirming in many cases by orders without opinion; these are not reflected in this summary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1330-7\">Four cases have been reversed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Akkn\">Pinkney v. United States, 124 U.S.App.D.C. 209, 363 F.2d 696 (1966), held that the trial judge abused his discretion by allowing the prosecutor to impeach a second degree murder defendant with prior convictions for the petty offenses of vagrancy, disorderly conduct and soliciting prostitution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1330-8\">Brown v. United States, 125 U.S.App.D.C. 220, 370 F.2d 242 (1966) reversed in part because the trial judge \u201cdid not base his ruling on * * * individualized considerations\u201d and thus could not be said even to have exercised his discretion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1330-9\">Barber v. United States, 129 U.S.App.D.C. 193, 392 F.2d 517 (1968), reversed because the trial judge had \u201cdenied defendant\u2019s motion to exclude his prior record without, so far as the record shows, invoking the <em>Luck </em>criteria.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AFo\">Jones v. United States, 131 U.S.App.D.C. 88, 402 F.2d 639 (opinion rendered Sept. 3, 1968), reversed because the trial court allowed the defendant to be impeached by a prior conviction for assault, a crime characterized as not going to veracity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1330-12\">Thus, of the four reversals, two <em>(Brown </em>and <em>Barber) </em>were cases where it was patent from the transcript that the trial court had in reality declined to exercise its discretion at all, and the other two were situations where the nature of the prior convictions impaired their relevance for impeachment purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1330-13\">Of the affirmances, in eight the court never went to the merits of the <em>Luck </em>contention because the defendant had not properly invoked the trial judge\u2019s discretion; in six cases the court affirmed even though it was somewhat critical of the manner in which the trial judge handled the issue; and twice the court has suggested that the case might have been reversed if the trial had occurred after <em>Gordon. </em>A summary of these affirmances follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1330-14\">Smith v.

The accused himself is, of course, the best source of information as to what he will testify to on the witenss stand. We have suggested that, by way of better informing the court\u2019s discretion prior to ruling on a <em>Luck </em>request, there is great merit in the practice of having him actually tell his story under oath out of the presence of the jury. As this court, speaking through Judge Burger, said in Gordon v. United States, 127 U.S.App.D.C. 343, 348, 383 F.2d 936, 941 (1967), cert. denied, 390 U.S. 1029, 88 S.Ct. 1421, 20 L.Ed.2d 287 (1968) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1327-8\">We recognize the undesirability of prolonging the trial unduly when the court is already confronted with requirements which work to that end, but in many cases the best way for the District Judge to evaluate the situation is to have the accused take the stand in a non-jury hearing and elicit his testimony and allow cross examination before resolving the <em>Luck </em>issue. Not only the trial judge, but both counsel, would then be in a better position to make decisions concerning the impeachment issue. * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AFg7\">The District Judge\u2019s personal evaluation of this suggestion is eloquently illuminated by the manner of his ruling on the request in this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ARyS\">THE COURT: I am not going to go through all this two trial business. You can keep him off the stand if you want to or you can put him on and take your chances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AlyE\">This comment seems to have been inspired by something other than the facts before him because, in almost the next breath, the judge said \u201c[0]f course, under the evidence, I can\u2019t understand why the District Attorney would not take attempted robbery.\u201d The whole thrust of defense counsel\u2019s request that the judge hear appellant\u2019s story directly was that, in view of the missing watch, there was a question as to whether a robbery had been committed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1328-6\">. The trial transcript shows that trial counsel made only a passing reference to the fact of appellant\u2019s earlier sentence under the Youth Corrections Act, and appellant here has done no more. There has, in short, been no claim, either to the District Court or to us, that the provisions of the Youth Corrections Act which contemplate the setting aside of the conviction in certain contingencies (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5021 (1964)) manifest a Congressional purpose that such convictions be not, at least under certain circumstances, used for impeachment. We know only that appellant was sentenced under the Youth Corrections Act for the earlier robbery and that he was on parole from that sentence at the time-of the trial in this ease.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1328-12\">. See the Appendix to this opinion for a summary of our experience with the <em>Luck </em>issue to date.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1329-7\">. This court has at least twice before been asked to rule on the constitutional validity of \u00a7 305. In Trimble v. United States, 125 U.S.App.D.C. 173, 369 F.2d 950 (1966), we declined to consider the argument, made for the first time on appeal, that impeachment by prior conviction under \u00a7 305 violated the due process clause. Similarly, in Robinson v. United States, No. 21947 (Decided Nov. 7, 1968) the court refused to reach the merits of an attack on \u00a7 305 on Sixth Amendment grounds because it was not raised in the District Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1329-9\">. Compare Spencer v. Texas, 385 U.S. 554, 87 S.Ct. 648, 17 L.Ed.2d 606 (1967). The constitutionality of the use of prior convictions in a criminal trial may be considered in a case now before the Supreme Court, Louisiana v. Cardinale, 251 La. 827, 206 So.2d 510, cert. granted 393 U.S. 959, 89 S.Ct. 388, 21 L.Ed.2d 372 (U.S. Nov. 21, 1968).

We have pointed out before that the policy problems presented do not have to be resolved by resort to the Constitution. <em>See </em>Luck v. United States, 121 U.S.App.D.C. 151, 348 F.2d 768-769 at n. 8. Both the American Law Institute and the Commissioners on Uniform State Laws concluded long ago that criminal defendants should not be impeached by prior convictions except by way of rebuttal of character evidence affirmatively adduced by the defense. Their Model Code of Evidence (Rule 106(3)) and Uniform Rules of Evidence (Rule 21), respectively, so provide.
