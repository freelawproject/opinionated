The appellee, prior to 1964, was a miner in the western part of Virginia. He developed chronic emphysema, arthritis, and stomach ulcers. He has been examined by physicians a number of times in the intervening period, and his condition, particularly emphysema, has worsened.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">Concededly, the appellee can no longer pursue his calling in the mines. In education he is quite limited, having gone \u201cto the third grade\u201d only, and is an illiterate. But the Secretary maintains that Ratliff could do other gainful work, despite his physical and educational limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">The Secretary relies on the 1967 amendment of the Social Security Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Ratliff maintains that the Act is unconstitutional if applied to him retroactively. We need not decide this issue. There is no substantial evidence in the record that, considering appellee\u2019s impairments, illiteracy, and limited work experience, he can engage in \u201csubstantial gainful work which exists in significant numbers [of jobs] either in the region where he lives or in several regions of the country.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b65-9\">.
