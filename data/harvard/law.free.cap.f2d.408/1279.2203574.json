At trial the appellant testified that he had removed the contraband from an abandoned house after he had seen unknown men place there what he thought was money. He realized that there were no stamps on the packets, believed that they contained heroin and admitted knowing that it is illegal to buy, sell or possess heroin. He denied knowing that what he had in his possession had been imported contrary to law or that he knew the source of the heroin.</p>\n<p id=\"b1335-22\">Counsel appointed by this court has contended that the second count had fatally failed to charge all of the essential elements of an offense under 21 U. S.C. \u00a7 174. The indictment, in pertinent part, set out that the heroin had been imported into the United States contrary to law \u201cwith the knowledge of Leslie A. Spriggs.\u201d Thus, to the extent that knowledge on the part of the accused is an element of the offense, it would seem to have been clearly alleged. We find no merit in the contention here proffered.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1336-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1280\">*1280</page-number>As to the instructions, we note at once that no objection had been raised at trial, and the appellant must be deemed to have waived any such point. Fed.R.Crim.P. 30. Moreover, the Supreme Court has pointed out the steps necessary \u2014 and here followed \u2014 for successful prosecution under the identical statutes here invoked.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1336-4\">Certainly the jury was not bound to accept the appellant\u2019s purported explanation, and it is our view that the instructions were neither confusing nor misleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b1336-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1335-23\">.
