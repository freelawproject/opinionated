McNichol was acting under orders issued by his Commanding Officer which authorized individual travel to New London and directed commercial transportation. Instead, Mc-Nichol chose to disregard these orders and travelled by his private automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-8\">It is statutory law that the United States is liable just as a private person for the acts of its employee acting within the scope of his office or employment. 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1346(b). We concur with the District Court\u2019s findings of fact that McNichol\u2019s use of his privately-owned vehicle was unauthorized and deny appellant Stone\u2019s contention that such findings are \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d. Mladinich v. United States, 394 F.2d 147 (5 Cir., 1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-9\">As to claimant Stone\u2019s argument that McNichol\u2019s actions were within his scope of employment, we find such to be void of merit. A review of the Florida cases reveals no law in this jurisdiction on this narrow point. Indeed, research has produced only one decision that is closely in point with the case <em>sub judice. </em>Paly v. United States, 125 F.Supp. 798 (D.Md., 1954), aff\u2019d 4th Cir., 1955, 221 F.2d 958. In light of the above case and the general principles of agency law, we hold that McNichol was not acting within the scope of his employment. The decision of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
