Petitioner was convicted of possession of the property seized in the search, and his standing is therefore established by Jones v. United States, 362 U.S. 257, 263-264, 80 S.Ct. 725, 4 L.Ed.2d 697 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-12\">The district court dismissed the petition on the further ground that petitioner would not be eligible for immediate release even if the convictions which he challenged were found to be invalid since he would still be required to serve a separate consecutive sentence which he did not attack. This ground for denying relief on habeas corpus was rejected by the Supreme Court in Peyton v. Rowe, 391 U.S. 54, 88 S.Ct. 1549, 20 L.Ed.2d 426 (1968), decided after the district court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-13\">Appellant\u2019s motion to. quash appellee\u2019s brief is denied. Appellant\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel on this appeal is also denied. The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded for further proceedings. If appellant\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel is renewed on remand, the district court may wish to consider the desirability of appointing counsel in view of the difficult issues presented by appellant\u2019s petition.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
