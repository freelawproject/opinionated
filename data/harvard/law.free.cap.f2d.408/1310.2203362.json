We are asked to determine whether, in view of the decision in Haynes v. United States, 390 U.S. 85, 88 S.Ct. 722, 19 L.Ed.2d 923 (1968), the charge against Lewis under \u00a7 5851 of the Act is meaningfully distinguishable from a charge under \u00a7 5821 of the Act for failure to pay a making tax and to file a declaration of intention to make a firearm covered by the Act. If the offenses covered by the two sections are indistinguishable, we are then asked to determine whether compliance with \u00a7 5821 of the Act would have compelled Lewis to incriminate himself, thus furnishing him with a complete defense to the prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b1367-11\">Appellant contends that the doctrine of Haynes v. United States, <em>supra, </em>should be extended to cover the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1367-12\">In <em>Haynes, </em>the Court considered the question of whether that portion of \u00a7 5851 <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> making possession of a firearm not registered pursuant to \u00a7 5841<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> was identical to and hence indistinguishable from the offense under \u00a7 5841 of failure to register possession of a firearm. It concluded that the registration clause of \u00a7 5851 incorporated the requirements of \u00a7 5841, so that a conviction under \u00a7 5851 was tantamount to a conviction under \u00a7 5841 and thus subject to any constitutional deficiencies found to be applicable to \u00a7 5841. The Court then found that the obligation to register under \u00a7 5841 was directed principally at persons who had obtained possession of a firearm without complying with the Act\u2019s other requirements and that they were therefore immediately threatened by criminal prosecutions under \u00a7 5851. The formal acknowledgment of possession and the supplementary information required to be furnished under the section and its accompanying regulation, 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 179.120, were found to substantially increase the risks of criminal prosecution. Thus, the Court held, a proper claim of the constitutional privilege against self-incrimination provided a full defense to prosecutions either for failure to register under \u00a7 5841 or for possession of an unregistered firearm under \u00a7 5851.</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1312\">*1312</page-number><em>Haynes </em>does not require a finding that the offense under \u00a7 5851 of possession of a firearm which was made without paying the tax or filing the declaration required by \u00a7 5821 is indistinguishable from the offense under \u00a7 5821 of failing to pay the tax and to file the declaration prior to making.</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-4\">In discussing \u00a7 5851 in its entirety, the Court in <em>Haynes </em>noted that violations of the making provision of \u00a7 5821, upon which the offense under \u00a7 5851 of possession of a firearm made in violation of the \u00a7 5821 provisions is premised, can have occurred, in the language of that clause of \u00a7 5851, \u201cat any time.\u201d This phrase, lacking in that portion of \u00a7 5851 dealing with possession of a firearm not registered pursuant to \u00a7 5841, was found by the Court to be a significant factor. The Court concluded that its omission from the registration portion of \u00a7 5851 was inconsistent with a construction of the registration clauses of \u00a7\u00a7 5851 and 5841 which would permit \u00a7 5851 to punish acceptance of the possession of a firearm which was never registered by any <em>prior </em>possessor and permit \u00a7 5841 to punish only a present possessor who has failed to register the fact of his possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-5\">The Court noted that, had a phrase analogous to the phrase \u201cat any time\u201d been used in the registration clause as it was in the making clause, the above construction would have clearly been the correct one.</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-6\">The offense under \u00a7 5851 of possession of a firearm which was made in violation of the making provisions of \u00a7 5821 is aimed only at present possession, and the offense consists of accepting or retaining possession of a firearm made at any time by any person without compliance with \u00a7 5821.</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-7\">The offense under \u00a7 5821 is aimed only at making the gun without complying with its requirement. The offense is complete and the maker has violated \u00a7 5821 when the gun is made without the prior declaration and tax. Since the failure to declare and pay the tax cannot be rectified after the weapon is made, there is no action required or, indeed, permitted of any possessor of a covered weapon made in violation of \u00a7 5821 which would prevent such possession from violating \u00a7 5851.</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-9\">Thus, unlike the offenses under \u00a7\u00a7 5851 and 5841 considered in <em>Haynes, </em>the elements of the offenses under \u00a7\u00a7 5851 and 5821 are not identical. See Taylor v. United States, 333 F.2d 721 (10th Cir. 1964) ; Sipes v. United States, 321 F.2d 174 (8th Cir. 1963), cert. denied 375 U.S. 913, 84 S.Ct. 208, 11 L.Ed.2d 150 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-10\">The distinction drawn by the court in <em>Haynes </em>has recently been followed in cases rejecting claims identical to those here made. DePugh v. United States, 401 F.2d 346 (8 Cir. 1968) ; United States v. Taylor, 286 F.Supp. 683 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-11\">Thus, the issue of whether the offense under \u00a7 5851 of possession of a firearm made in violation of \u00a7 5821 is properly distinguishable from the offense under \u00a7 5821 of failure to comply with the section\u2019s provisions must be resolved against the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-12\">It follows that appellant cannot claim that his timely assertion of the privilege against self-incrimination in the court below provided a full defense to the prosecution under \u00a7 5851.</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-13\">Even if it were assumed that appellant is correct in contending that the privilege against self-incrimination is available under \u00a7 5821, he would still have to bring himself within the purview of that section in order to invoke it. This he has failed to do. He stands charged and convicted under the separate offense set out in \u00a7 5851.</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-14\">Appellant\u2019s lack of standing to assert the privilege against self-incrimination he alleges to be available as a defense under \u00a7 5821 is not the. only insurmountable problem in the argument he here advances. He recognizes that in Mares v. United States, 319 F.2d 71 (10th Cir. 1963), a case involving an offense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1313\">*1313</page-number>identical to the one with which he was charged, it was held that the privilege against self-incrimination was not available under \u00a7 5821. He contends, however, that the <em>Haynes </em>doctrine compels a re-examination of <em>Mares.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1369-5\">His contention is based upon the unjustified assumption that both the requirements of \u00a7 5821 and the effect of compliance therewith are substantially analogous to those of \u00a7 5841, so that, if the privilege is available under \u00a7 5841, it is available under \u00a7 5821.</p>\n<p id=\"b1369-6\">The differences between the requirements of \u00a7\u00a7 5821 and 5841 were illuminated in Mares v. United States, <em>supra, </em>and in Russell v. United States, 306 F.2d 402 (9th Cir. 1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b1369-7\">In Russell v. United States, <em>supra, </em>the registration provision of \u00a7 5841 was found to be subject to an assertion of the privilege against self-incrimination because registration under \u00a7 5841 amounted to an admission that the registrant possessed a firearm and that he did not make or acquire it in compliance with the Act. Thus, registration disclosed a violation of other laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b1369-9\">In Mares v. United States, <em>supra, </em>the defendant relied on <em>Russell </em>in an effort to show that the privilege against self-incrimination found to apply to \u00a7 5841 also applied to a prosecution under \u00a7 5851 premised upon \u00a7 5821. In rejecting this contention, the court held that no self-incrimination inhered in the filing of the declaration of intent to make a firearm or in payment of the making tax prior to its making, i. e., no violation of other laws was thus compelled to be disclosed. On the contrary, the requirements of.\u00a7 5821 were held to establish the legality, rather than, illegality, of the possession of such a firearm. <em>Id. </em>319 F.2d at 73.</p>\n<p id=\"b1369-10\">The holding of the Court in <em>Haynes </em>is identical to and is based upon the same considerations as the holding in <em>Russell, </em>which was considered by the court in <em>Mares. </em>There is no indication in <em>Haynes </em>that the distinction drawn in <em>Mares </em>between \u00a7\u00a7 5821 and 5841 is not still viable, and <em>Mares </em>remains controlling in the present case. It should further be noted that the present case arose in Colorado which has no criminal statute covering the subject firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1369-12\">It is concluded that appellant\u2019s conviction pursuant to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5851 is. not invalid as in derogation of his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1369-13\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1366-12\">. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5851 provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1366-13\">\u201cIt shall be unlawful for any person to receive or possess any firearm which has at any 'time been transferred in violation of sections 5811, 5812(b), 5813, 5814, 5844, or 5846, or which has at any time been made in violation of section 5821, or to possess any firearm which has not been registered as required by section 5841. Whenever on trial for a violation of this section the defendant is shown to have or to have had possession of such firearm, such possession shall be deemed sufficient evidence to authorize conviction, unless the defendant explains such possession to the satisfaction of the jury.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1366-24\">. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5848(1), which is supplemented by 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 179.20, makes the Act\u2019s requirements applicable to certain weapons including shotguns having barrels of less than 18 inches in length.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1366-25\">. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5821 sets forth the making tax on such shotguns and, together with 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 179.78, delineates the procedure to insure its collection. Provided therein are the requirements which must be met prior to the making of such firearm. The maker must pay a making <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1311\">*1311</page-number>tax of $200.00 and must file with the Secretary of the Treasury a written declaration of his intention to make the firearm, affixed to which are the stamps issued upon payment of the tax. The written -declaration must include his photograph and fingerprints and must he supported by a certificate from the local police or other appropriate person, indicating satisfaction that the fingerprints and photograph are those of the de-clarant, and that the firearm is intended for lawful purposes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1367-8\">.

No person shall be required to register under this section with respect to a firearm which such person acquired by transfer or importation or which such person made, if provisions of this chapter applied to such transfer, importation, or making, as the case may be, and if the provisions which applied thereto were complied with.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
