The record also shows that appellant company had knowledge from appellee\u2019s doctor the next day that she had a herniated disc.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-10\">The District Judge who heard this case found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-11\">\u201cPlaintiff\u2019s employers knew where she worked and the character of her work. Her foreman knew that she was handling band pullers and turning over aluminum sheets. She gave him and the defendant\u2019s first aid department all of the material information she had on the subject. At that time she did not know that the incident had caused her herniated disc troubles.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-12\">\u201cIn the opinion of the Court, and the Court finds, that the circumstances in this record relieved her of the duty of giving the 30-day written notice of her claimed accident for the reason that she did not know that she had met with an accident.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b67-13\">The Tennessee Supreme Court has held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-14\">\u201cWhere the question of notice is raised by the pleadings the burden of showing notice or reason why same was not given is upon the employee. This statute makes the question of reasonableness of the excuse for failure to give written notice one peculiarly for the trial judge, but the material evidence rule applies to this issue of fact the same as to other issues of fact. Brookside Mills v. Harrison, 158 Tenn. 86, 11 S.W.2d 679 ; Marshall Const. Co. v. Russell, 163 Tenn. 410, 43 S.W.2d 208 ; York v. Federal Chemical Co., 188 Tenn. 63, 216 S.W.2d 725.\u201d Aluminum Company of America v. Rogers, 211 Tenn. 187, 193, 364 S.W.2d 358, 360 (1962).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b67-17\">We believe the facts in this record constitute material evidence which supports the finding of the District Judge on the subject of notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-18\">The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
