When he ceased his activity as a Pioneer and listed his principal occupation as automobile mechanic the Board reclassified him 1 A, and subsequently accorded him classification as a conscientious objector. Upon his refusal to report for civilian work in lieu of military service he was charged and convicted of a violation of 50 U.S.C.A. App. 456(j) and 462(a), and appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1382-19\">We agree with the district judge that there was a basis in fact for re-classification, and that the Board did not abuse its discretion in declining defendant\u2019s request to re-open and consider anew its final 1-0 classification.</p>\n<p id=\"b1382-20\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
