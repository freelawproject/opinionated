The same parties are before this Court who were litigants in the State Court action. The protract\u00e9d State litigation began in 1962.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-18\">District Judge Frank W. Wilson granted defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment and dismissed the complaint, applying the doctrine of res judicata. In his opinion the District Judge said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-19\">\u201c* -x- * there must be an end to litigation. Without it [the doctrine of res judicata], litigation would be endless.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-21\">\u201cThis litigation, too, must at some point end. It appears from the undisputed record that this is such a point.\u201d This case has been assigned to a panel</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A75\">pursuant to Rule 3(e) of the Supplementary Rules of this Court. The appeal is dismissed as frivolous and completely without merit under Rule 9 of the Supplementary Rules of this Court. Moist v.
