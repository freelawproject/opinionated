The appellant filed a suit for refund of a portion of the seized funds. The Government counterclaimed for an additional unpaid balance and moved for summary judgment on both the principal suit and the counterclaim. This is an appeal from the District Court\u2019s granting of that motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-18\">The appellant vigorously argues that there is an unresolved issue of fact as to whether or not he had been \u201cengaged in the business of accepting wagers,\u201d as the Government alleged. A close examination of the appellant\u2019s pleadings in the District Court, his answers to the Government\u2019s requests for admissions, and the relevant affidavits reveals quite clearly that the appellant was either unwilling or unable to make representations sufficient to show that the issue was genuinely disputed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This being true, the District Court\u2019s expeditious disposition must be, and it is,</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-19\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1073-11\">. It appears that appellant preferred to take, and did take, the legal position that the Government could not levy upon funds which were wrongfully seized in the beginning but which subsequently were applied to satisfy tax deficiencies. His reliance upon such proposition was mistaken. See Carlo v. United States, 286 F.2d 841, 848-849 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 366 U.S. 944, 81 S.Ct. 1672, 6 L.Ed.2d 855 (1961) ; Field v. United States, 263 F.2d 758, 762 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 360 U.S. 918, 79 S.Ct. 1436, 3 L.Ed.2d 1534 (1959).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
