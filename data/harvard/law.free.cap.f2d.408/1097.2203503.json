Willie Johnson urges, as the sole ground for reversal, that the circumstantial evidence against him was insufficient to support his conviction. We affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1154-15\">Willie Johnson contends that the district court erred in denying his motion for acquittal. The standard used in this Circuit to review the sufficiency of the evidence to support a conviction based on circumstantial evidence is the \u201creasonable hypothesis rule\u201d: A conviction based on circumstantial evidence should be affirmed only if this Court should conclude that the <em>jury </em>could reasonably find that the evidence excluded every reasonable hypothesis except that of guilt. The distinction between circumstantial and testimonial evidence has often been criticized,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> but the reasonable hypothesis rule is too firmly entrenched in the Fifth Circuit for this panel to tinker with it. See Thurmond v. United States, 5 Cir. 1967, 377 F.2d 448, 450-451 ; Strauss v. United States, 5 Cir. 1963, 311 F.2d 926 ; Clark v. United States, 5 Cir. 1961, 293 F.2d 445 ; Riggs v. United States, 5 Cir. 1960, 280 F.2d 949 ; Cuthbert v. United States, 5 Cir. 1960, 278 F.2d 220 ; Vick v. United States, 5 Cir. 1954, 216 F.2d 228 ; Orfield, Criminal Procedure Under the Federal Rules \u00a7 26:446 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b1154-18\">On the record, which we have read, we hold that the jury could reasonably conclude that the evidence was inconsistent with every reasonable hypothesis but that of the guilt of the accused. Accordingly, we find no error in the district court\u2019s denial of Willie Johnson\u2019s motion for acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1154-19\">Johnson also contends that the district court erred in denying his motion for a new trial. Viewing the evidence of the United States in the most favorable light, there is substantial evidence in the record to support the jury\u2019s verdict. O\u2019Connel v. United States, 5 Cir. 1968, 402 F.2d 760 [October 28, 1968]. The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion for a new trial. The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1154-14\">.
