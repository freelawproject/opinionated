The Board\u2019s Decision and Order, with the accompanying Trial Examiner\u2019s Decision are reported at 168 NLRB No. 22.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b850-12\">The conduct found to be violative of the Act was the company\u2019s resistance to efforts of the United Mine Workers to organize petitioners\u2019 employees, and its aid and espousal of a so-called independent union. Neither in its facts nor in the applicable law is this a case of precedential importance. The facts are adequately set out in the Trial Examiner\u2019s Decision and in the Board\u2019s Decision and Order. We are of the opinion that the factual findings of the Board are \u201csupported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole,\u201d and the law was correctly applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-15\">Now, therefore, it is ordered that the petition for review is denied and the order of the Board may be, and is, hereby enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-16\">Entered by order of the Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b850-13\">. Included in the Board\u2019s order was the direction that a specified election be set aside and a second election held. There appears to be no dispute but that such part of the order is not before us for consideration. See Morse Instrument Co. v. NLRB, 388 F.2d 1, 2 (6th Cir. 1967) ; Jervis Corporation, Bolivar Division v. NLRB, 387 F.2d 107, 108 (6th Cir. 1967).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
