He asserts that the district court improperly failed to suppress currency removed from a small overnight bag found on the front seat of the automobile which he had been operating when he was arrested. The currency was subsequently admitted in evidence against him at trial. He also claims error in the denial of his motion to dismiss the indictment and denial of his motion for a change of venue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-12\">Leaving aside the question of the correctness of the district judge\u2019s apparent conclusion that the search was incident to a lawful arrest, we are satisfied from our examination of the record that defendant consented to the search. On either basis, there was no violation of his Fourth Amendment rights. We find no error in the denial of defendant\u2019s other motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-14\">The judgment of the district court is Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
