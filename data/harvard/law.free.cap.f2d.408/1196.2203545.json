Our jurisdiction rests on 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a.</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-20\">Deportation proceedings were instituted against petitioner on the ground that he had entered the country without an immigrant visa and that he was therefore excludable at the time of entry, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a) (20), and was deporta-ble pursuant'to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(a) (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-21\">The sole issue on appeal is whether petitioner is entitled to the benefit of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(f), as that statute has been construed by the Supreme Court in Immigration and Naturalization Service v. Errico (1966) 385 U.S. 214, 87 S.Ct. 473, 17 L.Ed.2d 318.</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-22\">Petitioner is a native of India and a citizen of Iran. In late 1965, at the United States Consulate in Bombay, petitioner inquired about obtaining an immigrant visa. He was advised that the immigrant quotas for both Iran and India had been filled. Petitioner then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1198\">*1198</page-number>obtained a temporary visitor\u2019s visa to the United States, stating that he intended to remain in this country for no more than three months. In fact, petitioner intended to reside here permanently. Petitioner entered the country on January 4, 1966. His temporary visa was extended to September 3,1966.</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-4\">On September 2, 1966, petitioner was notified that deportation proceedings were to be instituted against him. Five days later petitioner married an American citizen. Petitioner had met his wife in Bombay before he left India and the two had planned to marry as soon as she divorced her then husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-5\">At the hearing to show cause why he should not be deported, petitioner\u2019s wife filed a visa petition in his behalf, and petitioner applied for permanent residence on the basis of his marriage. The visa petition attempted to establish petitioner\u2019s status as an \u201cimmediate relative\u201d within the meaning of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1151(b). That status would allow petitioner\u2019s admission to the United States as an immigrant without regard to quota restrictions imposed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1152, if petitioner \u201cotherwise qualified for admission.\u201d Petitioner\u2019s application for permanent residence was filed pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255, authorizing an adjustment in the status of an alien admitted into the United States to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence. Such adjustment can be made under regulations prescribed by the Attorney General and in his discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-6\">The special inquiry officer, relying on a prior administrative decision, granted the petitioner\u2019s application for permanent residence on the ground that petitioner\u2019s marital status was an equity in his favor warranting favorable administrative discretion. The Immigration and Naturalization Service appealed to the Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cthe Board\u201d), and the Board reversed the inquiry officer\u2019s decision on the ground that he had misinterpreted the prior decision. Petitioner was ordered deported.</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-7\">Petitioner then filed with the Board a Motion to Reconsider, urging that his deportation be suspended pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(f) which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1254-9\">\u201cThe provisions of this section relating to the deportation of aliens within the United States on the ground that they were excludable at the time of entry as aliens who have sought to procure, or have procured visas or other documentation, or entry into the United States by fraud or misrepresentation shall not apply to an alien otherwise admissible at the time of entry who is the spouse, parent, or a child of a United States citizen or of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1254-10\">The motion was denied, and petitioner seeks review of the Board\u2019s final order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-11\">The Board held that 1251(f) cannot save petitioner from deportation because he is not being deported on the ground that he was excludable at the time of entry as an alien who procured a visa by misrepresentation. <em>(See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1182(a) (19), 1251(a) (1).) Rather, petitioner is being deported on the ground that he was excludable at the time of entry as an immigrant without a valid unexpired immigrant visa <em>(see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1182(a) (20), 1251(a) (1)); therefore, the language of the statute cannot apply to petitioner\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-12\">Petitioner contends that the Board\u2019s decision is contrary to the Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of 1251(f) in Immigration and Naturalization Service v. Errico, <em>supra, </em>385 U.S. 214, 87 S.Ct. 473, 17 L.Ed.2d 318. <em>Errico </em>involved two cases in which aliens had obtained immigrant visas by misrepresentation. The misrepresentations secured for the aliens preferential status under existing quota requirements. The aliens were ordered deported on the ground that they were excludable at the time of entry because they were not nonquota immigrants as specified in their immigrant visas. (8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1181(a) (3), 1251(a) (1).) The aliens sought relief from deportation under 1251(f). Because the aliens were not being deported on the ground of fraud (8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a) (19)), they did not come within the literal language of 1251(f). But <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1199\">*1199</page-number>the Supreme Court held that the statute could not be literally applied in view of its broad humanitarian purpose to prevent the separation of family members. The Court held that 1251(f) \u201cwaives any deportation charge that results directly from the misrepresentation regardless of the section of the statute under which the charge was brought, provided that the alien was \u2018otherwise admissible at the time of entry.\u2019 \u201d (385 U.S. at 217, 87 S.Ct. at 476.) Otherwise, \u201can alien who entered by fraud could be deported for having entered with a defective visa or for other documentary irregularities even if he would have been admissible if he had not committed the fraud.\u201d The Court further held that quota restrictions could not preclude the immigrants from being considered \u201cotherwise admissible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1255-5\">The Government seeks to distinguish <em>Errico, </em>urging that it applies only to aliens who secure entry as immigrants by misrepresentations. It argues that 1251(f) cannot apply to those who gain entry under nonimmigrant visas because a contrary interpretation would cause a wholesale deterioration of the visa issuing process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1255-6\">We need not decide in general whether 1251(f) saves aliens who have fraudulently entered the country on non-immigrant visas and who have the requisite family ties from deportation on any charge. We need decide only whether petitioner is saved from deportation on the specific charge entered against him in this proceeding. (Cf. Hirsch v. Immigration and Naturalization Service (9th Cir.1962) 308 F.2d 562, 566.) We think that deportation charge \u2014 entry without an immigrant visa \u2014 resulted directly from petitioner\u2019s fraudulent concealment of his intention to remain in this country permanently. But for that misrepresentation petitioner would not have been excludable at the time of entry. The misrepresentation was germane to the deportation charge. Petitioner is therefore saved from deportation on the charge entered against him, if he were otherwise admissible for entry as an immigrant at the time of his entry according to the Immigration and Naturalization Act, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182. <em>Errico </em>establishes that quantitative limitations cannot preclude an alien from being \u201cotherwise admissible\u201d within the meaning of 1251(f), and this Court has held that failure to comply with documentary requirements cannot preclude an alien from being \u201cotherwise admissible.\u201d (Errico v. Immigration and Naturalization Service (9th Cir.1965) 349 F.2d 541, 546.) Whether or not petitioner was inadmissible because of any other of the requirements of the Immigration and Naturalization Act cannot be determined on the basis of the record before us. Under the circumstances it is appropriate to remand the cause for a determination of whether petitioner was otherwise admissible at the time of his entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b1255-8\">The Order is reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
