Kraus\u2019 action to enjoin his impending induction into the armed forces. The Act [50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 460(b) (3) (1968)] provides in part:<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"akr-dedup-1\">\u201cNo judicial review shall be made of the classification or processing of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>any registrant by local boards, appeal boards, or the President, except as a defense to a criminal prosecution instituted under section 12 of this title * * * after the registrant has responded either affirmatively or negatively to an order to report for induction * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">The district court held that the statute prohibited pre-induction judicial review of Kraus\u2019 classification and the order for him to report for induction, and it dismissed his complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief. We affirm, but in doing so we hold only that Kraus\u2019 complaint was premature. We do not pass upon the merits of his claim. These may be asserted after induction by ha-beas corpus, or if he refuses induction, by his defense to criminal prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">Kraus is thirty-one years of age. He had a III-A dependency deferment as a father living with his wife and children. To protest United States action in Vietnam he returned his registration certificate and classification card to the government. His local board declared him a delinquent on the ground that he failed to have his classification card in his possession and reclassified him I-A. When ordered to report for induction, he responded by bringing this action, alleging that his reclassification was punitive and that it violated the First and Fifth Amendments of the Constitution. He also attacked the constitutionality of \u00a7 10(b) (3) and the statutes and regulations under which the board acted.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-13\">The Supreme Court construed \u00a7 10(b) (3) in Oestereich v. Selective Service Bd. No. 11, 393 U.S. 233, 89 S.Ct. 414, 21 L.Ed.2d 402 (1968), and Clark v. Gabriel, 393 U.S. 256, 89 S.Ct. 424, 21 L.Ed.2d 418 (1968).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> These cases do not deal expressly with Kraus\u2019 situation, but they chart the course we believe must be followed. Gabriel sought to enjoin his induction and to obtain a declaration that the rejection of his claim to conscientious objector classification was improper. The Court observed that the board had statutory authority to take the action which Gabriel challenged and that the classification involved a determination of fact and exercise of the board\u2019s judgment. The Court held \u00a7 10(b) (3) to be constitutional and that it barred Gabriel\u2019s premature application for relief, saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-14\">\u201cWe find no constitutional objection to Congress\u2019 thus requiring that assertion of a conscientious objector\u2019s claims such as those advanced by ap-pellee be deferred until after induction, if that is the course he chooses, whereupon habeas corpus would be an available remedy, or until defense of the criminal prosecution which would follow should he press his objections to his classification to the point of refusing to submit to induction.\u201d 393 U.S. at 259, 89 S.Ct. at 426.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ao_\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>Oestereich, as a* gesture of protest, returned his registration certificate to the government. The board declared him delinquent for failure to have the certificate in his possession, classified him I-A, and ordered his induction. The significant factual difference that distinguishes <em>Oestereich </em>from the case before us is this: Oesterich was a ministerial student with a IV-D exemption; Kraus, as previously mentioned, had a III-A dependency deferment. In <em>Oeste-rich </em>the Court held that \u00a7 6(g) of the Act [50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 456(g) (1968)], which provides in part that \u201cstudents preparing for the ministry * * * shall be exempt from training and service * * created a statutory exemption beyond reach of the board through delinquency proceedings. The Court said at 393 U.S. 237, 89 S.Ct. 416:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-5\">\u201cOnce a person registers and qualifies for a statutory exemption, we find no legislative authority to deprive him of that exemption because of conduct or activities unrelated to the merits of granting or continuing that exemption. The Solicitor General confesses error on the use by Selective Service of delinquency proceedings for that purpose.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b680-12\">Kraus stands on a somewhat different footing than Oestereich. Previously Kraus had been granted a student deferment. Section 6(h) (1) of the Act<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> provides that upon the termination of a student deferment, the registrant shall be liable for induction regardless of his age unless he is deferred under other exceptions specified in the Act. Among the exceptions is deferment for extreme hardship to dependents. Section 6(h) (2) of the Act<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> authorizes the President \u201cunder such rules and regulations as he may prescribe\u201d to grant a deferment to a person who lives with his wife and children. It was under these provisions that Kraus was granted his III-A dependency deferment.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-13\">Among the rules and regulations to which Kraus\u2019 deferment was subject were those which required him to retain in his personal possession at all times his registration certificate<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and notice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>of classification.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In a memorandum dated October 24, 1967, the Director of Selective Service recommended that local boards declare a registrant delinquent if he fails to keep these papers in his possession <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and to reclassify him I-A.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\"> It is apparent from the Act that Kraus did not have a statutory exemption that was placed beyond the scope of delinquency proceedings. Instead, he had an administrative deferment which was subjected by statute to rules and regulations prescribed by the President. The validity of Kraus\u2019 reclassification and order to report for induction depend upon the propriety of the administrative action taken by the board. But thus far the board has taken only intermediate steps. Not until Kraus is accepted or rejected for service will the administrative process be completed. Kraus\u2019 situation provides no compelling reason for departing from the long established principle that \u201cCongress [is] not required to provide for judicial intervention before final acceptance of an individual for national service.\u201d Falbo v. United States, 320 U.S. 549, 554, 64 S.Ct. 346, 349, 88 L.Ed. 305 (1944). For similar reasons, albeit under different circumstances, the constitutionality of \u00a7 10(b) (3) was upheld in Clark v. Gabriel, 393 U.S. 256, 89 S.Ct. 424, 21 L.Ed.2d 418 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">The only exception to the deferment of judicial review recognized by the Supreme Court arises from administrative action that deprives a registrant of a statutory exemption. E. g., Oeste-reich v. Selective Service Bd. No. 11, 393 U.S. 233, 89 S.Ct. 414, 21 L.Ed.2d 402 (1968). Since Kraus does not fall within this exception, he can contest his reclassification only after completion of administrative action as prescribed by Congress in \u00a7 10(b) (3). In reaching this conclusion we find support in other recent decisions that have denied preinduction review to delinquent registrants who had classifications similar, but not identical, to Kraus\u2019 III-A dependency deferment. Kolden v. Selective Service Bd. No. 4, 406 F.2d 631 (8th Cir., 1969) (graduate student) ; Breen v. Selective Service Bd. No. 16, 406 F.2d 636 (2d Cir., 1969) (undergraduate) ; Zigmond v. Selective Service Bd. No. 16, 396 F.2d 290 (1st Cir. 1968) (former student not in the prime age group) ; Carpenter v. Hendrix, 277 F.Supp. 660 (N.D.Ga.1967) (junior college student). <em>Contra, </em>Armendariz v. Hershey, 295 F.Supp. 1351 (W.D. Texas, Feb. 5, 1969) (graduate student) ; Kimball v. Selective Service Bd. No. 15, 283 F.Supp. 606 (S.D.N.Y. 1968) (undergraduate).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-12\">Kraus\u2019 claims are substantial. In holding that he cannot assert them at this time, we do not adjudicate the merits of his complaint. Nor do we decide the government\u2019s alternative defense \u2014 -</p>\n<p id=\"b681-13\">Kraus\u2019 failure to exhaust his administrative appeals. Kraus\u2019 post-induction review will provide an appropriate forum for the consideration of this issue in the light of Kraus\u2019 constitutional and statutory challenge of his classification.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-14\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b678-13\">. The 1987 amendment, \u00a7 8(e) of the Military Service Act of 1967, 81 Stat. 104, codified prior case law. E. g., Witmer v. United States, 348 U.S. 375, 75 S.Ct. 392, 99 L.Ed. 428 (1955) ; Estep v. United States, 327 U.S. 114, 66 S.Ct. 423, 90 L.Ed. 567 (1946) ; and Falbo v. United States, 320 U.S. 549, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>64 S.Ct. 346, 88 L.Ed. 305 (1944). But see Wolff v. Local Bd. No. 16, 372 F.2d 817 (2d Cir. 1967), which allowed pre-induction review of delinquency reclassification. \u201cSection 10(b) (3) was likely precipitated by <em>\u00cdWolff].\u201d </em>Oestereich v. Selective Service Bd. No. 11, 393 U.S. 233, 245, n. 7, 89 S.Ct. 414, 420, 21 L.Ed.2d 402 (1968) (concurring opinion of Mr. Justice Harlan). The 1967 amendment was designed to reemphasize that \u201cjudicial review of classification should not occur until after the registrant\u2019s administrative remedies have been exhausted and the registrant presents himself for induction.\u201d S.Rep. No. 209, 90th Cong., 1st Sess., 10 (1967), quoted in Oestereich v. Selective Service Bd. No. 11, 393 U.S. 233, 247, 89 S.Ct. 414, 21 L.Ed.2d 402 (1968) (dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Stewart).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b679-16\">. The Supreme Court also denied applications for stays in Shiffman v. Selective Service Bd. No. 5, 391 U.S. 930, 88 S.Ct. 1831, 20 L.Ed.2d 849 (1968), and Zigmond v. Selective Service Bd. No. 16, 391 U.S. 930, 88 S.Ct. 1831, 20 L.Ed.2d 851 (1968). In both cases the registrants were declared delinquents, and lower courts applied \u00a7 10(b) (3) to deny pre-induction review. See also Boyd v. Clark, 287 F.Supp. 561 (S.D.N.Y.1968), <em>affd per curiam, </em>393 U.S. 316, 89 S.Ct. 553, 21 L.Ed.2d 511 (1969), which held that \u00a7 10(b) (3) barred a pre-induction challenge to the constitutionality of student deferments.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b680-6\">. In his memorandum submitted to the Court in April 1968, the Solicitor General stated in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-7\">\u201cIt is possible to construe [\u00a7 10(b) (3)] as applicable to the generality of situations where the local board has applied its judgment, but to exclude purported action of a board which is in fact contrary to an exemption which has been expressly granted by statute. Such a construction, is not only possible here, but it is desirable in order to avoid conflict with the congressional determination to grant exemption to ministers and ministerial students. In this situation it may be observed that there is room for an appropriate distinction between an order which is contrary to the terms of a statute and an order which is subject to challenge only on the ground that the board has misapplied or abused its authority in making its judgment.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b680-8\">.
