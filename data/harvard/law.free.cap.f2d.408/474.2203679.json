TEEN TWIST has been advertised on occasion through the media of newspapers and radios. It was stipulated that one of appellant\u2019s restaurants located in Maryland sold 669 TEEN TWIST sandwiches in the week of July 27, 1964.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-20\">The board observed that while appellant had pleaded the use of the term TEEN as a trademark for sandwiches, the record disclosed that the term had been used by it <em>only </em>as a part of the mark TEEN TWIST.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-21\">The record further discloses that ap-pellee is the owner of subsisting registrations of the marks THE BURGER FAMILY, MAMA BURGER, PAPA BURGER, and BABY BURGER, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>and that through the facilities of drive-in type restaurants, it has used those marks and the mark TEEN BURGER in connection with the sale of hamburger sandwiches.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">The board held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-7\">Since it thus appears that opposer is here the prior user, and the marks of the parties are both applied to sandwiches, this case turns solely on a comparison of the marks.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-8\">In this regard, \u201cTEEN TWIST\u201d and \u201cTEEN BURGER\u201d are both suggestive of sandwiches appealing to teenagers. Considering the nature of these marks, and the differences between them when considered in their entireties, it is our opinion that their contemporaneous use is not reasonably likely to cause confusion or mistake or to deceive.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-9\">Our review of the record and the briefs and arguments of counsel are not persuasive of error in the decision of the board. We deem it pertinent to point out more precisely than did the. board that the actual sandwich designations employed by appellant were TEEN TWIST SANDWICH and TEEN TWIST. The letters and words designating the sandwich in appellant\u2019s menu exhibit are all of standard, bold block form. The descriptive contents of the sandwich have no reference to burger or hamburger. The words TEEN TWIST SANDWICH appear conjointly in a single line comprised of letters of the same size and type. The TEEN element thereof is not distinguished by space, position, type or style from the remainder of the phrase. In the menu exhibit appellant\u2019s hamburger sandwich is designated by the registered mark MIGHTY MO. Other burger sandwiches offered thereon are identified by the description \u201cHot Shoppe\u2019s\u201d and \u201cGrilled Cheeseburger.\u201d It is of interest to note that appellant\u2019s witness, Mrs. Haney, described the Teen Twist sandwich as being wrapped with paper bearing the mark MIGHTY MO on the inside of the wrapping.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-10\">Finding it highly dubious from the record that TEEN per se wTas ever selected or promoted to identify any of appellant\u2019s sandwiches, and considering the marks in their entireties, we fail to see any likelihood of confusion. In our opinion the record fairly supports the decision of the board, which is accordingly affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"Axj\">.
