United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Company, 224 F.2d 158 (5th Cir. 1955). The motion is submitted on briefs without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-11\">We construe the order to be limited by the district court\u2019s construction that production was sought only insofar as the documents would shed light upon or produce or lead to relevant information.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-12\"> Under the teaching of <em>Overby </em>the matter is not ripe for review until the district court enters its ultimate order directing the specific portions of the documents that are to be produced as against assertion of executive privilege as to any or all of such portions (if there be an assertion at all). There must be \u201creasonable effort * * * by the parties, by the court, and by the head of the executive department to avoid a conflict of interests.\u201d Through the procedures described in <em>Overby, </em>or some similar procedure, \u201cthe competing public interests of the administration of justice and of governmental privilege may be reconciled. Every reasonable effort will have been made to avoid a conflict. If, nevertheless, a claim of privilege has to be decided by the Court, at least it will be in as narrow compass as possible.\u201d Id. at 164.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-14\">Once the claim of privilege, if it continues to be asserted to any extent, is reduced to \u201cas narrow compass as possible\u201d the matter will be ready for review by this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-15\">The motion for summary remand is granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
