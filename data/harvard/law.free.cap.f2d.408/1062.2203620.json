(Raymond, Mayer, Jenner &amp; Block, Chicago, Ill., of counsel), for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b1118-22\">Before WORLEY, Chief Judge, and RICH, ALMOND and BALDWIN, Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b1118-23\">RICH, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b1118-24\">This appeal is from the decision of the Patent Office Trademark Trial and Appeal Board, abstracted at 152 USPQ 836, dismissing appellant\u2019s opposition to ap-pellee\u2019s application to register \u201cAUTO-CHRON\u201d on the Principal Register for \u201cwatches,\u201d serial No. 182,988, filed December 13, 1963, claiming first use July \u00cd, 1963. Appellant\u2019s opposition is based on its prior use and registration<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of \u201cACCUTRON\u201d for \u201cwatches.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-25\">The issue is whether \u201cAUTOCHRON\u201d so resembles \u201cACCUTRON\u201d as to be likely, when both are applied to \u201cwatches,\u201d to cause confusion or mistake or to deceive. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1052(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-26\">Both parties have taken testimony and have submitted numerous documentary and physical exhibits. From the record it appears that appellant has, since about 1960, continuously used \u201cACCUTRON\u201d as a trademark to identify a line of unique electro-mechanical timepieces <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1063\">*1063</page-number>which differ from conventional watches in the use of an electronically-driven tuning fork as the timekeeping element. Witnesses for appellant testified that from 1960 to 1965 sales of \u201cACCU-TRON\u201d watches exceeded $24,000,000 and that over $5,000,000 was expended for \u201cACCUTRON\u201d advertising during that same period.</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-4\">Appellee has used \u201cAUTOCHRON\u201d as a trademark for a line of self-winding watches since July 1963. During the period from July 1, 1963, to June 30, 1965, appellee sold approximately nine thousand \u201cAUTOCHRON\u201d watches having an estimated value in excess of $400,000 and spent in excess of $200,000 on advertising material in which \u201cAUTO-CHRON\u201d watches were featured or appeared.</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-5\">Inasmuch as both appellant\u2019s registration and appellee\u2019s application recite \u201cwatches\u201d as the goods to which the marks of the parties are applied, the goods here involved are identical, notwithstanding the fact that at the time the subject opposition was commenced the parties were <em>using </em>their marks on distinctly different types of watches.</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-6\">In summary, the board was of the view that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1119-7\">* * * the differences between \u201cAU-TOCHRON\u201d and \u201cACCUTRON\u201d in sound, appearance, and significance are sufficient to render the mark reg-istrably different and to obviate any likelihood that purchasers would mistakenly assume that the watches sold thereunder originate from the same source.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1119-8\">Specifically, the board noted \u201can apparent discernible difference\u201d between the parties\u2019 marks and found the differences in pronunciation of \u201cACCU\u201d and \u201cAUTO\u201d to be sufficient to distinguish the marks as to sound. The board also appears to have attached substantial importance to the supposed \u201csignificance\u201d of the respective marks. In this regard, the board said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1119-14\">* * * opposer\u2019s Director of Advertising and Sales Promotion testified that \u201cACCUTRON is a happy combination that suggests accuracy through electronics\u201d. With respect to applicant\u2019s mark, Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (1961 Edition) defines \u201cauto\u201d as a combining form denoting \u201cautomatic, self-acting or self-regulating\u201d and \u201cchron\u201d as a combining form from the Greek \u201cChronos\u201d meaning \u201ctime\u201d. \u201cAUTOCHRON\u201d therefore suggests \u201cautomatic or self-regulating time\u201d and thereby creates a commercial impression completely different from that connoted by \u201cACCU-TRON\u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1119-15\">While we agree with the board that there are differences between the involved marks in sound, meaning, and appearance, we think the board has over-analyzed the marks. We do not consider the self-evident differences in sound and appearance to be so substantial, when the marks are considered in their entireties, as to assure that consumers will not be confused. We are not convinced that even the average consumer would be as conscious of the significance of \u201cACCU-TRON\u201d intended by appellant or the significance of \u201cAUTOCHRON\u201d as was the board. In short, we are essentially of the same mind as we were in the \u201cTIMEX\u201d \u2014 \u201cTELIX\u201d case,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> where, in spite of differences discoverable by close analysis, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1119-16\">We are not quite satisfied that when the competing marks are placed on identical goods and viewed in their entirety their differences are of so clear and positive a nature as to preclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1064\">*1064</page-number>the likelihood of confusion we think Congress intended * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1120-4\">We respect the reasoning and conclusions below and <em>reverse </em>only on the well-established principle of trademark law of resolving doubt in favor of the first user who, here, as shown by the record, has * * * spent considerable time and money in establishing and promoting its mark. The newcomer is free to choose another mark, but not one which comes so close to appellant\u2019s mark as we think is the case here.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1120-6\">We think the marks \u201cAUTOCHRON\u201d and \u201cACCUTRON\u201d have sufficient obvious similarities as to be likely to cause substantial confusion or mistake. The decision of the board is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"AGH\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1118-15\">.
