After a thorough consideration of the record, we have concluded that Judge Shaw correctly decided that this action is barred by the two-year limitation period prescribed in N.J.S. 2A:14-2, N.J.S.A. See Hughes v. Smith, 389 F.2d 42 (3rd Cir. 1968).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b429-22\">The July 3, 1968, order of the District Court will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b429-8\">. The affidavits attached to the motion for summary judgment show:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-9\">(a) On September 4, 1959, plaintiff received a medical exemination by Dr. Sandford (the prison doctor) which shows a negative Wasserman test.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-10\">(b) The only indication of any mental condition of plaintiff in his medical record is as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-11\">\u201c11/4/59 Came over to medical \u2014 Seen by Dr. Sandford \u2014 would not talk kept staring at wall. On order of Dr. Sandford confined to Cell and kept under observation for mental disorder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-12\">11/12/59 Returned to Wing\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-13\">(c) Plaintiff visited the prison hospital frequently from 1/14/60 to 6/25/60 but there is no indication of any mental or emotional disorder on his hospital record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AV_\">(d) The defendant Dr. Movaney (Mul-vaney) was not connected with the Essex County Penitentiary in any capacity in 1959 or 1960.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A0r\">The record indicates that plaintiff went from the above state penitentiary to the Federal Detention Center in New York City and thence to the U. S. Northeastern Penitentiary at Lewisburg, Pa. The record before the District Court contains no indication that he was sent at any time to the Federal Prison Hospital at Springfield, Missouri, or that he has ever been adjudicated insane. Under these circumstances, the District Court was justified in deciding that N.J.S. 2A: 14-21, N.J.S.A. (suspending N.J.S. 2A: 14-2, N.J.S.A. during insanity) is inapplicable.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
