This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-26\">In his petition, appellant alleged that his state convictions on charges of armed robbery and receiving stolen goods<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1188\">*1188</page-number>constitutionally defective for a number of reasons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1244-4\">(1) There was no probable cause for his arrest;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1244-5\">(2) The search of the car in which he was a passenger at the time of his arrest was invalid on the ground that it was made without a warrant and was not incident to the arrest, even if the arrest was lawful;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1244-6\">(3) The search of his home was invalid, even though a search warrant had been obtained, because the warrant did not describe the product of the search which was admitted in evidence; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1244-7\">(4) \u201cThe belated appointment of counsel rendered his services ineffective in that he was delegated to represent petitioner en route to the courtroom the day of the trial.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1244-8\">The district court concluded that the first three grounds did not violate appellant\u2019s constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-9\">With respect to the Sixth Amendment claim of ineffectiveness of counsel, the court said that this \u201ccontention * * * is without merit,\u201d citing In re Petition of Ernst, 294 F.2d 556 (3d Cir. 1961), and United States ex rel. Peterson, v. Russell, 266 F.Supp. 93 (W.D.Pa.1967).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The same contention as to ineffective counsel had been made in the habeas corpus proceeding in the state court<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and was rejected in an opinion, dated December 2, 1966,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> by Judge Graff, who had also been the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-15\">We would dispose of this appeal on the well-reasoned opinion of Judge Marsh below were it not for the fact that following the date of that opinion (March 6, 1968), we established for the first time a definite standard for determination of the issue of ineffective counsel in belated appointment cases: United States ex rel. Mathis v. Rundle, 394 F.2d 748 (May 7, 1968). In a supplemental brief filed by appellant, he relies directly on <em>Mathis </em>for the requested relief. Neither the lower state court opinion nor the decision below discussed specifically the late appointment aspect of appellant\u2019s petitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-16\">Prior to <em>Mathis </em>this court had not dealt expressly with the issue of burden of proof where the claim of ineffective counsel was bottomed on hasty appointment.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In Mathis,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> following the lead of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1189\">*1189</page-number>the Fourth Circuit, <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> we said that the belated appointment of counsel is inherently prejudicial and makes out a prima facie case of denial of effective counsel, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1190\">*1190</page-number>with the burden of proving absence of prejudice shifted to the prosecuting authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-4\">At first blush it would appear that only an evidentiary hearing, in which the state adduces the testimony of the trial counsel and other evidence to rebut the taint of prejudice, can be sufficient to overcome the prima facie presumption of ineffective counsel. A closer examination of the full scope of the, Fourth Circuit rule we have chosen to follow discloses that denial of effective representation may also be refuted where the \u201crecord\u201d contains \u201cadequate <em>affirmative </em>evidence to overcome the presumption of harm from the lack of time for preparation\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> by appointed counsel: Fields v. Peyton, 375 F.2d 624, 628 (4th Cir. 1967).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We construe this to mean that the prima facie ineffectiveness or the inherent prejudice due to late appointment of counsel may properly be overcome <em>either </em>by evidence produced by the state in an evidentiary hearing showing that there was no prejudice <em>or </em>by adequate affirmative proof <em>otherwise </em>appearing in the record demonstrating that the appellant was not prejudiced. We believe this is a logical approach which is fair to a petitioner seeking relief and at the same time comports with sound judicial administration.</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-14\">The alternative methods of negating the prima facie harm from a belated appointment are of particular importance-in the present case because the Commonwealth made no attempt in either the state or federal habeas corpus proceeding (as <em>had </em>been done in Mathis) to produce evidence showing that the appellant was not prejudiced by the late appointment of counsel.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Therefore, this court must either find from an examination of the record before us that there is adequate affirmative proof to rebut possible prejudice to the appellant or remand the petition to the district court for an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-15\">With the foregoing guidelines in mind, we now turn to a review of the various <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1191\">*1191</page-number>proceedings culminating in the instant appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-5\">Appellant alleged in his state and federal habeas corpus petitions that he first met his counsel on the way to the courtroom on the day of the trial.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> This was not denied by the District Attorney in his answer in the state court. The appointed defense counsel was Vincent A. Tamburo, Esq., of the Allegheny County Legal Aid Society, who was described by the state court as \u201can attorney of great experience in the trial of criminal cases.\u201d <footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1247-6\">This was not the first time appellant had seen a lawyer, however, as this was a new trial on the same charges, the first one having ended in a mistrial. In the first trial appellant had been represented by another member of the Legal Aid Society staff. Also, in the habeas corpus hearing in the state court, in which appellant appeared,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> the following colloquy took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1247-7\">Mr. Abromson [Assistant District Attorney]:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1247-8\">Q. So you have been in Jail for tsome five months, is that correct, before your trial?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1247-9\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1247-10\">Q. And during that time, did anybody come to see you in your own behalf?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1247-11\">A. Which way do you mean? Did an attorney come to see me?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1247-12\">Q. Did anyone come to see you in own behalf?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1247-13\">A. Yes.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1247-14\">While it would appear from the foregoing that Mr. Tamburo had access to the Legal Aid Society files in this case, and that an attorney or a representative of Legal Aid may have visited appellant in jail, the plain fact is that appellant did not have the opportunity to consult previously with <em>the </em>counsel who came to defend him on the morning of the second trial. We do not know what preparation, if any, counsel was able to accomplish prior to the date of the trial as he did not testify in the state habeas corpus proceeding and there was no evidentiary hearing in the district court. From the lower court opinion, as will appear later, we are led to believe that counsel was not wholly familiar with all aspects of the case before trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-15\">Appellant asserts as the prejudicial effect of the late appointment the failure to present pre-trial motions to suppress several items of evidence admitted at the trial. The district court concluded from an examination of the transcript of trial that Mr. Tamburo probably had no knowledge of the manner in which some of the evidence was obtained by the police.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1247-16\">Appointed counsel in the state habeas corpus proceeding, Mr. Dixon, did not pursue the belated appointment allegation as an independent ground for issuance of the writ, even though it was stressed in appellant's pro se petition. Mr. Dixon said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1247-17\">I want to make clear to the District Attorney it is not our intention to attack the effectiveness of counsel here. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1192\">*1192</page-number>The only reason I brought out this particular circumstance was in relationship, and I will develop it, to the District Attorney\u2019s contention that our issue of the suppression of the evidence not being timely, that\u2019s the only reason I brought that out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ap8\">The Court: You are not raising\u2014 Mr. Dixon: I am not raising the issue of the ineffectiveness of counsel. The Court: It is in his statement here, his petition, but you are not raising it now?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AU7K\">Mr. Dixon: No.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1248-6\">Mr. Dixon emphasized that he was referring to the belated appointment only to show why no pre-trial suppression motions had been filed. In his brief (p. 7) the District Attorney construes counsel\u2019s statement as indicating \u201cthat petitioner was abandoning the contention that his trial counsel was ineffective.\u201d In light of our disposition of this appeal - we need not decide what effect, if any, the state habeas corpus counsel\u2019s statement had on appellant\u2019s Sixth Amendment claim which he raised again in the district court.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1248-7\">It is fairly clear that Mr. Tamburo\u2019s appearance as defense counsel on the morning of the trial constitutes tardy appointment so as to raise the prima facie presumption of ineffective counsel under the <em>Mathis </em>standard. With no attempt by the state to rebut this presumption by the production of countervailing evidence, does the record otherwise contain adequate affirmative proof of lack of prejudice? We believe that it does.</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-13\">Appellant's contention that his arrest without a warrant was invalid is not involved with the question of ineffective counsel. Judge Marsh\u2019s opinion below thoroughly recites the information which the police had from eyewitnesses<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> to support the arrest of appellant without a warrant for the commission of a felony: McCray v. Illinois, 386 U.S. 300, 304, 87 S.Ct. 1056, 18 L.Ed.2d 62 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-14\">The evidence as to which appellant contends pre-trial suppression motions should have been but were not filed due to the belated appointment of counsel consisted of (1) revolvers found in the war-rantless search of the car in which appellant was a passenger when he was arrested, and (2) revolver shells found in appellant\u2019s home pursuant to a search warrant which he claims did not identify the shells. The revolvers were alleged to have been used in the armed robberies and the shells matched the revolvers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-15\">With respect to the revolvers found in the vehicle, the district court held that a warrant was not required because the search was made incident to a lawful arrest.\u2019 While admittedly the search of the vehicle was not made at the same moment as the arrest, a thorough search was not then possible because of darkness, and the automobile was searched and the revolvers found when the vehicle was taken to a police station a short time later.</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-16\">As the District Attorney points out in his brief, appellant\u2019s reliance on Preston v. United States, 376 U.S. 364, 84 S.Ct. 881, 11 L.Ed.2d 777 (1964), is misplaced. In <em>Preston, </em>an arrest was made for vagrancy and the defendant\u2019s car was towed to a garage and some time later <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1193\">*1193</page-number>searched without a warrant, producing evidence which led to conviction for conspiracy to rob a bank. The search was held invalid both because of the lag of time following the arrest and because there was no direct relationship between the vagrancy charged and the evidence secured.</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-4\">In upholding the search here, the district court properly relied on United States v. Dento, 382 F.2d 361 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>389 U.S. 944, 88 S.Ct. 307, 19 L.Ed.2d 299 (1967), in which we distinguished <em>Preston </em>in an arrest on a highway where the defendant\u2019s vehicle was driven to the State Police barracks some distance away to be searched. For reasons of safety the search was not conducted along the highway where the arrest was made. As in this case, there was a \u201creasonable nexus\u201d in <em>Dento, </em>382 F.2d at 366, between the offense for which the arrest was made and the search of the vehicle, a nexus absent in <em>Preston</em><footnotemark><em>21</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1249-5\">Thus, the failure to file a pre-trial motion to suppress the evidence as to the revolvers was not prejudicial because, on the merits, it would undoubtedly have been decided against appellant. More importantly, the lower state court and the district court <em>did </em>examine this particular issue on the merits and concluded the evidence was admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-6\">The matter of the revolver shells found in appellant\u2019s home is more difficult. A warrant had been issued to search appellant\u2019s home. The warrant was lost and could not be produced at the habeas corpus proceedings in the state and federal courts. Appellant contends that the shells should not have been admitted into evidence because they were not described in the search warrant. The likelihood that the search warrant did not specify the shells is supported by the trial testimony of the police officer making the search.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1249-8\">Complicating the picture was the fact that an objection to the admission of the bullets had been sustained in the first trial which ended in a mistrial. Defense counsel in the <em>second </em>trial did object to the admission of the shells on the grounds of irrelevancy and a defective search warrant but his objections were overruled. The district court\u2019s opinion indicates that appellant\u2019s counsel at the second trial did not know \u201cof any possible impropriety in the manner in which the bullets were seized until the time when they were offered.\u201d <footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Even if counsel had known about this earlier, the district court observed, he may still have failed to file a pre-trial suppression motion as he may have been \u201cmisled by the exclusion of the bullets at the prior trial into believing that upon objection they likewise would be excluded at the second trial.\u201d <footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1249-9\">Judge Graff, in the state habeas corpus proceeding, rejected the attack on the admission of the shells on the ground that the failure to file a pre-trial suppression motion was prejudicial to the Commonwealth and the matter could not be raised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1194\">*1194</page-number>at the trial.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> He also said it \u201c[i]s permissible to seize things other than those described in the search warrant if they have a reasonable relation to the purpose of the search.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1250-4\">The district court held that even if the search warrant is assumed to have been defective, and the revolver shells improperly admitted, this did not entitle appellant to relief because the error was harmless, relying on Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967). The court recognized the <em>Chapman </em>test that \u201cbefore a constitutional error can be held harmless, the court must be able to declare a belief that it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d and then proceeded to detail the substantial evidence, particularly the testimony of identity witnesses, including the victims of the robberies, supporting the convictions.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> We agree with the lower court in the application of the harmless error rule in this factual context.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Even apart <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1195\">*1195</page-number>from the harmless error principle, however, we believe the revolver shells were admissible in accordance with the authorities cited in note 26 in the margin.</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-5\">From a careful examination of the record and of the opinions of the lower courts which have reviewed this case, we are convinced that there is \u201cadequate affirmative proof\u201d to rebut the prima facie presumption of prejudice from the belated appointment of counsel.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1251-6\">In view of this conclusion, there is no reason to remand the petition for an evi-dentiary hearing as appellant urges us to do under Townsend v. Sain, 372 U.S. 293, 83 S.Ct. 745, 9 L.Ed.2d 770 (1963). There are no factual disputes which require resolution by a plenary hearing as in <em>Townsend.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1251-7\">The district court had before it the transcript of the state court trial and the transcript of the state habeas corpus proceeding. We have recognized that the appointment of defense counsel here was belated, and we have analyzed the elements of harm asserted by appellent in the admission of the contested evidence. Inadmissibility was claimed on constitutional grounds which have been dealt with on the merits by the district court to our satisfaction. This is not a case where belated appointment of counsel may have resulted in the failure to call witnesses whose availability the defendant did not have a chance to disclose to his counsel or where there was insufficient time to call them,<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> or in the failure to raise defenses of which counsel was unaware or which he was unprepared to pursue,<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> or in an improvident plea of guilty.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> At most, counsel failed to file <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1196\">*1196</page-number>pre-trial suppression motions with respect to certain evidence secured by police searches. Since the district court did not refuse to consider the challenge to the evidence on the merits and dealt with the constitutional infirmities that were raised,<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> the sum and substance of the case is that appellant was not prejudiced by the late appointment of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-4\">We have dwelled at some length on the principal issue in this case because this is one of the first appeals to raise directly the charge of belated appointment of counsel since <em>Mathis.</em><footnotemark><em>34</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The claim of ineffective counsel due to tardy appointment is a serious constitutional challenge which may not be lightly dismissed. We reaffirm the position taken in <em>Mathis, </em>and we reiterate the words of Judge Weiner in concluding the opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1252-5\">The hopeful practical consequence of our rule thus enunciated will be that the states and their judicial systems in the Third Circuit will become more careful in permitting appointed counsel to fulfill in a realistic manner the function which they should have been responsibly assuring all along. 394 F. 2d at 753-754.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1252-6\">The denial of the writ of habeas corpus by the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1243-15\">. The opinion of Judge Marsh in the court below is reported at 281 F.Supp. 96 (W.D.Pa.1968).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1243-16\">. While on parole from a prior conviction, appellant took part in two armed robberies of gas stations, one on* May 13, 1963, in McKeesport, Pa., and the other on May 20, 1963, in North Braddock, Pa. He was found guilty by a jury and sentenced to a term of four to eight years for the May 13 charges and to a term of two to seven years for the other charges. The first sentence was to be served concurrently with another sentence for an unrelated armed robbery offense imposed earlier [Commonwealth v. Chambers, 209 Pa.Super. 709, 224 A.2d 371 (1966), vacated by State Supreme Court and further appellate proceedings pending]; the two to seven year term of imprisonment was to be served consecutively to the other sentences. There was no direct appeal from these convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"A4Hq\">The issues raised by appellant relate to the convictions for both the McKeesport and North Braddock offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"AGV2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1188\">*1188</page-number>The answer filed in the state court habeas corpus proceeding by the Superintendent of the State Correctional Institution in Pittsburgh indicates that because these offenses constituted a parole violation requiring appellant to serve first the time remaining on a prior conviction, he may not begin serving the new sentences which he challenges until the end of January, 1969. This fact does not foreclose the present habeas corpus application, of course, Peyton v. Rowe, 391 U.S. 54, 88 S.Ct. 1549, 20 L.Ed.2d 426 (1968), having abolished the prematurity doctrine.

Commonwealth ex rel. Chambers v. Duggan, No. 1988 January Term, 1966, Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, <em>aff'd per curiam, </em>210 Pa.Super. 718, 231 A.2d 336 (1967), allocatur denied by the Supreme Court at No. 2193A Miscellaneous Docket, July 21, 1967.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1244-20\">. In United States v. Helwig, 159 F.2d 616 (3d Cir. 1947), a federal criminal proceeding, we granted relief where the record showed that the defendant\u2019s counsel was appointed one minute before trial and defendant contended he was thereby denied sufficient time to prepare for trial. There was no discussion of whether the defendant had the burden of showing prej<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1189\">*1189</page-number>udice. Judge Biggs did conclude the opinion by stating: \u201cIt is notable also that the appellee [the United States] does not contend that Helwig was awarded due process of law guaranteed to him by the Fifth Amendment.\u201d Perhaps this comment presaged the <em>Mathis </em>holding that late appointment is inherently prejudicial and absence of prejudice must be proved by the prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"AGCH\">Relying, <em>inter alia, </em>on Helwig, United States v. Vasilick, 206 F.Supp. 195 (M.D.Pa.1962), granted a new trial where counsel was appointed moments before trial even though there was no clear proof of prejudice made out by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"AP5\">In another late appointment case, United States ex rel. Tillery v. Cavell, 294 F.2d 12 (3d Cir. 1961), in remanding the case to the lower court, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9nP\">The finding of fact that \u201ccounsel had not been appointed until the day of trial, * * * \u201d was too limited and there should be explicit findings of fact that lead to the conclusion that counsel was unable to effectively represent Til-lery otherwise than only from his being appointed on the trial day. 294 F.2d at 22.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ars-dedup-0\">In several more recent district court decisions in this Circuit prior to <em>Mathis, </em>where it was charged that counsel was appointed too close to the time of trial to become familiar with the case, it was stated that the \u201ctime of appointment of counsel, in itself, does not establish ineffective assistance.\u201d United States ex rel. Spears v. Rundle, 268 F.Supp. 691, 700 (E.D.Pa.1967), <em>aff\u2019d per curiam, </em>405 F.2d 1037 (3d Cir. 1969), where we held, after <em>Mathis, </em>that in the evidentiary hearing below the state had rebutted any presumption of injury; United States ex rel. Kelley v. Rundle, 242 F.Supp. 708 (E.D.Pa.), <em>aff\u2019d per curiam, </em>353 F.2d 214 (3d Cir. 1965).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"ape-dedup-0\">. In <em>Mathis, </em>the trial counsel, a voluntary defender, was assigned to the case by his office the night before the trial. His trial preparation involved review of the notes of a colleague, who had previously interviewed the petitioner in that case, as well as a half hour meeting with witnesses prior to the trial. In Judge Weiner\u2019s opinion, he noted that counsel was hard pressed to assure a conscientious defense, but he concluded, from the facts of the case and from counsel\u2019s inability to say in his testimony in the habeas corpus proceeding in the district court that he had been insufficiently prepared to go to trial, that the prima facie presumption of denial of effective representation due to belated appointment (discussed <em>infra) </em>was effectively rebutted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1245-13\">.

Virginia, 365 F.2d 549 (4th Cir. 1966).</p>\n<p id=\"Aod\">While the United States Supreme Court does not appear to have considered the precise question of burden of proof of prejudice in belated appointment cases, the whole concept of timely and effective representation by counsel stems, as we pointed out in <em>Mathis, </em>from Powell v.

The Supreme Court said there, in another context:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AHm0\">It is true that in most cases involving claims of due process deprivations we require a showing of identifiable prejudice to the accused. Nevertheless, at times a procedure employed by the State involves such a probability that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1190\">*1190</page-number>prejudice will result that it is deemed inherently lacking in due process. * * * 381 U.S. at 542-543, 85 S.Ct. at 1632.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1246-7\">.

The fact that the Commonwealth did not attempt to produce such evidence, <em>i. e. </em>by calling as a witness the counsel who was belatedly appointed, is understandable. In the first place, at least in the state proceeding, appellant seemed to have abandoned his ineffective counsel claim. See text at note 18, <em>infra. </em>Secondly, the <em>Mathis </em>rule was not in effect at that time, and the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania as late as November 14, 1967, following Commonwealth ex rel. Dion v. Tees, 180 Pa.Super. 82, 118 A.2d 756 (1955), had expressly rejected the burden of proof formula in belated appointment cases as developed in the Fourth Circuit. In Commonwealth ex rel. Washington v. Maroney, 427 Pa. 599, 607-608, 235 A.2d 349, 354 (1967) the Court said :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1246-12\">Appellant asserts that counsel\u2019s lack of time to confer and prepare is inherently prejudicial and that, combined with three alleged trial errors, must result in a finding of ineffective assistance of counsel. The problem of the hastily appointed or insufficiently prepared attorney is one of first impression for this Court. Appellant insists, citing Fields v. Peyton, 375 F.2d 624 (4th Cir. 1967), and Twiford v. Pey-ton, 372 F.2d 670 (4th Cir. 1967), that once it is demonstrated that counsel had but a brief time to prepare, a prima facie denial of effective assistance has been shown and the burden of proof that counsel\u2019s representation was effective then should be placed on the state. We can find no justification, however, for such an allocation of the burden of proof. As with other assertions of a denial of constitutional rights in post conviction proceedings, the burden remains throughout with the prisoner to demonstrate any constitutional deprivation. (Footnotes omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"acu-dedup-1\">For subsequent disposition of a <em>federal </em>habeas corpus petition by the same relator [Washington] after <em>Mathis, </em>see note 34 <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"A-v\">The better practice now in this type of case would be to have the \u201cbelated appointee\u201d testify at the earliest possible stage of post-conviction proceedings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1247-18\">.

After the defendants were arrested in a car on a highway and placed in jail, the police searched their car which had been parked outside the jailhouse by the police. The Court did not reach the question of \u201cremoteness\u201d because of absence of probable cause for the warrantless search as incident to the arrest. Unlike <em>Dyke, </em>the search here was directly related to a quest for instrumentalities and fruits of the offense for which appellant was arrested and, as in <em>Dent\u00f3, </em>there was a valid reason for the short delay in making the search of the vehicle after the arrest.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b1249-14\">. 281 F.Supp. at 98, n. 4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b1249-15\">. <em>Id. </em>at 98.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b1249-16\">. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b1250-5\">.

A number of witnesses identified him from this distinctive feature so that the admission of the jacket itself, which was the product of an illegal search, was harmless.
