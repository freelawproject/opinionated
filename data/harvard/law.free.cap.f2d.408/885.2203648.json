Tucker was granted a judgment of acquittal; all other defendants were found guilty by the jury. Only John Fields, Jr., appeals from the judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-6\">In urging reversal, appellant contends that (1) he was denied effective assistance of counsel, (2) the indictment is duplicitous, and (3) a severance should have been ordered as to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-7\"> Admitting he never moved for a severance of his case in the court below, appellant contends that it was plain error<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for the trial court not to order a severance of his case, since it was clear from the evidence as it developed that his co-defendant Moncur would have been a valuable witness in appellant\u2019s behalf. In support of this assertion, appellant points to a written statement of Moncur, admitted into evidence, in which there is inked out the name of a man Moncur knew was engaged in the operation. Speculating that the excised name is not his, appellant claims Moncur could testify to that effect, and thus corroborate appellant\u2019s testimony that he did not even know Moncur during the period in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-18\">We recently reviewed a similar contention, and stated the law of this Circuit as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b942-19\">\u201c \u2018An intention of the movant to have his codefendant testify has never been considered ground for severance. [Citing, inter alia, Kolod v. United States, 371 F.2d 983 (10th Cir. 1967) ; Gorin v. United States, 313 F.2d 641 (1st Cir. 1963) ; Olmstead v. United States, 19 F.2d 842, 53 A.L.R. 1472 (9th Cir. 1927).] This is especially true where, as here, any prejudice resulting from the joint trial is merely speculative. Lott has neither shown nor asserted that (1) Smith\u2019s version of the facts would have any exculpatory effect [Citing United States v. Echeles, 352 F.2d 892 (7th Cir. 1965). See also Garnett v. United States, 404 F.2d 26 (5th Cir. 1968) (per curiam).] or that (2) Smith . would more likely testify were he tried separately. [Citing, inter alia, Kolod v. United States, supra.] <em>We do not conjecture abuses of discretion.\u2019 </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b942-20\">See also Sullins v. United States, 10 Cir., 1968, 389 F.2d 985, 989. See generally 8 Moore, Federal Practice \u00b6 14.04[4], pp. 14-30 (2d ed. 1968).\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b942-21\">A fortiori, we will not conjecture the type of abuse which may be noticed as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>plain error or defect affecting substantial rights.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Appellant does not complain of the admission of Moncur\u2019s statement.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> He embraces its admission, and speculates that Moncur\u2019s corroboration thereof would be even more helpful, and that, therefore, a severance should have been ordered. This assertion, without a showing as to the likelihood of the testimony being given in separate trials, and without any evidence that that testimony would tend to exculpate the appellant, is not sufficient to show the prejudice required under Rule 14, F.R.Crim.P., much less that required for reversal absent a motion for severance below.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-5\">Appellant next contends that the indictment is duplicitous, in that it charges him in one count, in the conjunctive, with stealing, unlawfully taking, carrying away, <em>and </em>concealing. This contention was overruled by the trial court when presented in a pretrial motion to quash and in the motion for judgment of acquittal made by appellant at the end of the government\u2019s case in chief. The ruling was correct. Where a statute specifies several alternative ways in which an offense can be committed, the indictment may allege the several ways in the conjunctive, and a conviction thereon will stand if proof of one or more of the means of commission is sufficient.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the United States,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> it is sufficient to support a verdict of guilty on at least some, if not all, of the acts alleged in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-9\">Appellant\u2019s final contention, that he was deprived of effective representation of counsel, centers around the fact that the same attorney represented both him and Moncur. Claiming that there was a conflict of interests to the prejudice of appellant, he argues, as he did in connection with the severance question, that it was in his best interest that Moncur testify, but that Moncur\u2019s best interests were to the contrary. Thus, he continues, the same attorney could not represent both effectively. Having held that there is no showing that Mon-cur\u2019s failure to testify had any prejudicial effect on appellant\u2019s case, this contention needs little discussion. There was neither objection, claim nor notice to the trial court of any alleged conflict between the interests of the appellant and Moncur. We are neither directed to nor can find any indication in the record of such a conflict, other than mere speculations disposed of above.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> There was no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>denial of appellant\u2019s right to effective assistance of counsel under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b944-4\">The judgment appealed from is Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b942-8\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 659 reads, in relevant part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b942-10\">\u201cWhoever embezzles, steals, or unlawfully takes, carries away, or conceals, * m. * from any * * * motor-truck, or other vehicle, or from any * * * storage facility, station, station house, platform or depot * * *, or from any aircraft, air terminal, airport, aircraft terminal or air navigation facility with intent to convert to his own use any goods or chattels moving as or which are a part of or which constitute an interstate or foreign shipment of freight, * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b942-16\">\u201cShall in each case be fined not more than $5,000 or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both; but if the amount or value of such * * * goods or chattels does not exceed $100, he shall be fined not more than $1,000 or imprisoned not more than one year, or both.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AuV\">The jury specifically found the goods involved to have a value of more than $100.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b942-25\">.
