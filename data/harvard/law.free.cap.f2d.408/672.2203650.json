Having studied the briefs and record, we have determined that the petition for enforcement is appropriate for summary disposition without oral argument. Pursuant to new Rule 18 of the Rules of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, the Clerk of this Court has been directed to place this case on the summary calendar and notify the parties in writing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b729-14\">The merits of the case can be disposed of on the basis of the briefs and the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-15\">Briefly, the Board found that the Company violated Section 8(a) (1) of the Act by coercively interrogating employees, threatening employees with discharge, creating the impression of surveillance, promising benefits to encourage employees to refrain from union activities, withholding benefits to discourage union activities, and conditioning reemployment of an employee on his withdrawal of support for the Union. There is substantial evidence on the record, as a whole, which supports the Board\u2019s findings that the Company violated Section 8(a) (1) of the Act. N. L. R. B. v. Link-Belt Co., 311 U.S. 584, 61 S.Ct. 358, 85 L.Ed. 368.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-18\">The Board further found that Garland violated Section 8(a) (3) and (1) of the Act by unlawfully discharging, laying off, and failing to reinstate or recall six employees in order to discourage union activity and membership. A perusal of the whole record shows substantial evidence to support the Board\u2019s findings that the Company violated Section 8(a) (3) and (1). Although there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>were conflicting inferences of discriminatory or non-discriminatory employer motivation, the choice between two fairly conflicting views and inferences is primarily the province of the Board. N. L. R. B. v. Plymouth Cordage Co., 381 F.2d 710, 711 (5 Cir., 1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">Order enforced.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b729-19\">. In order to establish a docket control procedure, the Fifth Circuit adopted new Rules 17-20 on December 6, 1968.
