He was sentenced to twenty-five years on each count the sentences to run concurrently. He was identified as one of the participants in the bank robbery by witnesses expressing varying degrees of confidence in their identification. Holt\u2019s spending and displaying of unwonted amounts of cash following the robbery was received as corroborating evidence. An accomplice testified in detail as to Holt\u2019s association with him in accomplishing the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-9\">The District Judge\u2019s charge to the jury was argumentative, and it is urged that his there recitals of fact were in some instances inaccurate. However, in view of the clear evidence of guilt and the fact that objections to the Court\u2019s charge were not made before the jury retired, as required by Rule 30, F.R.Crim.P., we will not find reversible error in the Court\u2019s instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-10\">We have considered other claims of error and are satisfied that none of them call for reversal in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-11\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
