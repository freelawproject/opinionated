ROBINSON, III, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b211-29\">This appeal challenges the authority of the Secretary of the Army to bar interment of the remains of Robert G. Thompson in a national cemetery.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thompson saw action during World War II in the Pacific Theater, where his \u201cextraordinary heroism\u201d won the Distinguished <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>Service Cross <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and approval for a battlefield commission as an officer. Before the commission could be effectuated, Thompson was disabled by malaria and tuberculosis contracted during service in New Guinea. This condition led to his honorable discharge and an award of wartime disability compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">After Thompson\u2019s death in 1965, appellant, his widow, had his body cremated and requested burial in Arlington National Cemetery. Appellant supplied all information required, the Army gave its official approval, and arrangements were made to convey the decedent\u2019s ashes to their final resting place. It was then \u2014eight days before the interment date \u2014that a story appeared in the press announcing the projected burial and recounting Thompson\u2019s post-war difficulties with the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">Subsequent to his discharge from the Army, Thompson was convicted under the Smith Act<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of conspiracy to advocate the violent overthrow of the government of the United States, and was jentenced to imprisonment for three yeais. After the Supreme Court affirmed h s conviction,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> he absconded, and for this he was convicted of criminal contempt.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> An additional term of four years was imposed, to run consecutively to the original sentence.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b212-14\">The post mortem publicity linking Thompson, the hero, with Thompson, the pariah, created an immediate stir. A member of Congress denounced the plan for his burial in Arlington Cemetery as \u201cmisplaced bureaucratic idealism.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> On the day following, the Army notified appellant that the matter was under review. With doubt as to whether the then existing Army regulation purported to foreclose consummation of the plan, the Army promptly amended it to clearly cover the situation.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Simultaneously, the Army announced that both the old and the new regulations operated to defeat appellant\u2019s project,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and on the next day apologized to her for \u201cany distress you may have had because of conflicting advices.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b212-15\">Appellant then brought suit in the District Court for declaratory and in-junctive relief, and there, as here, the controversy centered upon the pertinent legislative and administrative specifications.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> At the time of Thompson\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>death in 1965 and for many years previously, Congress had authorized the burial of honorably discharged soldiers in national cemeteries. \u201cUnder such regulations as the Secretary of the Army may * * * prescribe,\u201d read the statute in force in 1965, the remains of persons within described categories \u201cmay be buried in national cemeteries.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> One of these categories embraced \u201c[a]ny * * * former member of the Armed Forces who served on active duty * * and whose last such service terminated honorably.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">The Secretary of the Army, however, had promulgated a regulation, in vogue when Thompson passed away, prohibiting interment in a national cemetery of \u201c[a] person otherwise eligible * * * who is convicted * * * of a crime or crimes, the result of which is * * * a sentence to imprisonment for 5 years or more.\u201d <footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In an obvious effort to avoid a contest as to whether Thompson\u2019s three- and four-year sentences constituted \u201ca sentence * * * for 5 years or more\u201d within the meaning of that provision, the Army\u2019s newly-formulated regulation, to which we have adverted,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> stated that those convicted of Smith Act violations would be denied the burial privilege, and that \u201c[s]eparate sentences served consecutively and which aggregate 5 years or more are disqualifying.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark>*</p>\n<p id=\"b213-9\">With the facts substantially undisputed, the District Court entertained cross-motions for summary judgment and ruled in appellees\u2019 favor. Focusing upon the statutory language \u201cthe remains of the following persons <em>may </em>be buried in national cemeteries,\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> the court felt that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-10\">\u201cThe word \u2018may\u2019 is significant. The section does not provide that the remains of the following persons <em>shall </em>be entitled to be buried in national cemeteries. A different situation would be presented if such phrase had been adopted by Congress.\u201d <footnotemark>17</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AZ9b\">Thus, said the court, the statute</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-11\">\u201c* * * conferred upon the Secretary the right and the election to permit the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>burial of such persons as he deems proper, by regulation, of anyone in the various classes enumerated in the statute. It does not give a vested right to every member in each of the classes enumerated in the statute. It follows, hence, that the Secretary may adopt regulations determining as to who shall be entitled to be buried in national cemeteries provided he does not extend that privilege to anyone who is not deemed eligible by the statute.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">The court further held that the Army\u2019s conclusion that Thompson\u2019s consecutive sentences constituted \u201ca sentence to imprisonment for five years or more\u201d was \u201ca reasonable construction\u201d of the regulation existent at Thompson's death, and that retroactive application of the amended regulation was permissible.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">We do not share the District Judge\u2019s confidence that the mere contrast of \u201cmay\u201d and \u201cshall\u201d isolates congressional intent respecting the Secretary\u2019s administrative authority in this area, or resolves the question whether the choice as to Thompson\u2019s burial in a national cemetery lies with the Army as well as with his widow. \u201cMay\u201d ordinarily connotes discretion,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> but neither in lay <footnotemark>20</footnotemark> nor legal<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> understanding is the result inexorable. Rather, the conclusion to be reached \u201cdepends on the context of the statute, and on whether it is fairly to be presumed that it was the intention of the legislature to confer a discretionary power or to impose an imperative duty.\u201d <footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b214-12\">The factor looming largest upon examination of the instant problem is the obviously beneficent objective of the statute at bar. For honorable duty in the Armed Forces, Congress has bestowed upon defined classes of veterans and their families the values associated with eternal rest in a national cemetery. By this and a number of other benefits the Nation but strives to repay those whose service safeguards her very existence. Courts have traditionally read laws of this character liberally,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> with a view <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>to spreading the boon broadly unless the legislature had manifested a desire to dole it out narrowly. We are unable to detect any reason why the very same considerations should not fully obtain here.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">So it is that we find that the context of the statute summons the likely probability that Congress imposed upon the Secretary of the Army a nondiscretionary obligation respecting the burial of honorably discharged veterans. We now proceed to explore the statute\u2019s legislative and administrative history for evidence of such weight as might dispel that probability. Then, confronting plain indications of congressional purpose supporting appellant\u2019s thesis, and the conspicuous absence of those factors in the development of the regulations as would normally cause us to defer to the Secretary\u2019s construction of a statute he administers, we conclude that Congress conferred upon the decedent a right to burial in a national cemetery unconditioned by the Secretary\u2019s exercise of judgment. Because the Secretary lacked power to exclude Thompson\u2019s remains from interment in a national cemetery,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> and without reaching other issues tender<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>ed, we reverse the District Court\u2019s judgment and remand the case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">\n<em>The 1872 and 1878 Cemetery Acts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Avm\">National cemeteries were given birth in 1862 when Congress granted power to the President to purchase land \u201cto be used as a national cemetery for the soldiers who shall die in the service of the country,\u201d <footnotemark>25</footnotemark> a provision apparently limited in scope to burial of those dying on active duty in Civil War campaigns. A decade later, however, Congress twice enlarged the class of eligibles, first in 1872:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-6\">\u201c* * * au soldiers and sailors honorably discharged * * * who may die in a destitute condition, <em>shall </em>be allowed burial in the national cemeteries <em>* </em>* <em>*\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>26</em></footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"aof-dedup-0\">and then in 1873:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-9\">\u201c* * * honorably discharged [servicemen] who served during the late war * * * <em>may </em>be buried in any national cemetery * * * free of cost and their graves shall receive the same care and attention as the graves of those already buried.\u201d <footnotemark>27</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b216-11\">Appellees argue that the shift in language from \u201cshall\u201d to \u201cmay\u201d represents a concomitant shift in meaning. By their interpretation, the 1872 statute insured the burial of all active servicemen dying destitute, while the 1873 act, though broadening eligibility, made the privilege wholly discretionary. One has little difficulty, however, in discerning the circumstances that eradicate support for this position.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-19\">It seems clear from the language of the 1873 statute that Congress, in extending the cemetery benefit to those veterans who could afford burial elsewhere, hardly intended to dissipate the benefit as to those who could not. Certainly we would expect that had Congress willed that incongruous result, it would have spoken much more clearly <footnotemark>28</footnotemark> \u2014 just as it had done previously \u2014 and recently \u2014 in the formulation of other legislation designed to care for deserving ex-servicemen. In 1851, when Congress established a Soldiers\u2019 Home for retired and disable Army veterans,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> it not only defined eligibility<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> but also explicitly directed the automatic exclusion of otherwise eligible persons who had been convicted of felonies, and conferred administrative discretion to exclude others on the basis of express standards.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> To us, the contrast between the two regulatory schemes is glaring.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>Other historical facts cast further doubt on any reading of the 1873 cemetery statute as a grant of wide discretionary powers to the Secretary of the Army. The administration of the cemeteries did not become the Secretary\u2019s function until three years later.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Not until 70 years after that was there a delegation of authority to establish administrative regulations.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> There is no evidence of administrative exclusion of anyone for more than a half-century following the 1873 enactment,<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> and Congress has never set standards for administrative exclusion.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> We are unable to find that the indefeasible burial privilege Congress gave in 1872 became administratively defeasible in 1873.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">\n<em>The 19b8 Cemeteries Act</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AHlG\">Without statutory authority, the Army had long extended burial privileges to members of the immediate families of eligible veterans.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> It had also, since 1927, denied some otherwise eligible veterans the privilege because of conviction of crime. The latter course, pursued initially on an <em>ad hoc </em>basis, became the subject of an administrative regulation in 1947.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b217-14\">In 1948, the Secretary requested congressional approval of certain practices initiated by him over the years in the oversight of the national cemeteries. Particular emphasis was placed upon the Secretary\u2019s long established custom of extending burial privileges to selected classes not made eligible by st\u00e1tute.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> In a recommendation for confirmatory action in that area, Secretary of War Patterson implored Congress to enact \u201cenabling legislation for the burial in national cemeteries of all members of the armed forces who die in the service or after having been honorably discharged therefrom, together with members of their immediate families as specified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>therein, provided such burial is desired.\u201d<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">With little debate<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> on the matter, Congress passed the 1948 amendments in substantially the same form <em>requested:</em><footnotemark><em>42</em></footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"ak2-dedup-0\">\u201c[B]urial in national cemeteries of the remains of the following classes of persons is authorized under such regulations as the Secretary of the Army may prescribe:<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-5\">\u201c(a) Any member or former member of the armed forces of the United States whose last service terminated honorably, by death or otherwise;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-6\">\u201c(b) [A]ny citizen of the United States who, during any war in which the United States has been, or may hereafter be engaged, served in the armed forces of any government allied with the United States during such war, and whose last service terminated honorably, by death or otherwise; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-15\">\u201c(c) [T]he wife, husband, widow, widower, minor child, and, in the discretion of the Secretary of the Army, unmarried adult child of any of the persons enumerated in (a) and (b), herein * * <footnotemark><em>44</em></footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b218-16\">Appellees would have us believe that these modifications subjected, for the future, eligibility for burial to regulations issued by the Secretary. This contention suffers fatally from the complete lack of any evidence that Congress knew of the Army\u2019s past exclusionary practices.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> In contrast to the full explanation of the policy regarding burial of servicemen\u2019s families, the Army never told Congress that during a 20-year period it had turned down some statutory eligibles. We cannot hold that the grant to the Secretary of power to make regulations approved a policy of which Congress was not aware.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b218-17\">Nor can we accept appellees\u2019 argument that the grant of rule-making authority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>deputized the Secretary to restrict statutory eligibility at will. If, indeed, Congress had so intended, its detailed specification in the statute of the classes of persons entitled to burial served considerably less than its normal purpose. It is historically more accurate to say that in extending burial rights to servicemen\u2019s relatives, Congress put an end to administrative improvisation in eligibility to the extent that it had been informed of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">We think it clear that what Congress did in 1948 was to recognize previously ineligible groups which the Army was admitting to the cemeteries, to consent to their burial therein in the future, and to grant the Secretary power to make housekeeping regulations.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> This conclusion is reinforced by the fact that Congress expressly delegated to the Secretary discretionary authority over burials within one \u2014 but only one \u2014 of the statutorily eligible classes.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> In the face of that explication, we do not read into the statute a grant of discretion over all.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b219-12\">\n<em>The 1959 Cemetery Act</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b219-13\">The latest revision of the legislation under scrutiny occurred in 1959, and the interment privilege was then enlarged once more,<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> consistently with the \u201cmajor purpose * * * to broaden the categories of those eligible for burial in --national cemeteries * * * \u201d<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> There appears to have been little dispute over the additions; there were no hearings and both the Senate <footnotemark>52</footnotemark> and the House <footnotemark>53</footnotemark> reports reflected general agreement<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> in that objective.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-15\">There is nothing to indicate that in 1959, any more than in 1948, Congress was made aware that the Army had barred convicted felons from the cemeteries. And although it was in 1959 that the statutory reference to the Secretary of the Army, preceding the specifications <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>of eligibility, was cast in its current form,<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> the legislative history is barren of any reason for the change.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">Because, however, the felony exclusion incorporated in the Army\u2019s 1947 regulations <footnotemark>56</footnotemark> was published in the Federal Register in 1952,<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> appellees urge that the 1959 amendments reinforced the Secretary\u2019s power to perpetuate that exclusion. For this they rely on the canon of statutory construction that reenactment without change after a course of administrative interpretation is tantamount to legislative ratification of the interpretation.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> As we have indicated,<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> \u201c[t]he rationale of that canon must be, either that those in charge of the amendment are familiar with existing rulings, or that they mean to incorporate them,\u201d<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> and no evidence appears that the felony exclusion rule came to the attention of Congress. Additionally, the 1959 revisions were meant to \u201cbroaden,\u201d not narrow, \u201cthe eligibility requirements for burial in national cemeteries,\u201d<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> and in congressional understanding existing eligibility was unaffected by conviction for crime.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> Under these circumstances we see no basis for concluding that the statutory changes in 1959 amounted to an affirmation of the Arirfy\u2019s policy of rejecting felons.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-18\">\n<em>The 1968 and 1965 Hearings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b220-19\">In the course of congressional hearings in 1962 and 1965, a version of the Army\u2019s felony exclusion regulation appeared in one of the House documents. Appellees contend that this regulation was specifically brought to the attention of Congress and that no question was raised as to its validity, with the result that Congress ratified the Secretary\u2019s interpretation of the statute as a grant of power to bar felons though otherwise eligible. Thus appellees at this point rely upon inaction, rather than on action as they previously did,<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> as the source of legislative approval of the administrative technique under assault, and they do so without avail. Legislative silence cannot mean ratification unless, as a minimum, the existence of the administrative practice is brought home to the legislature.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> Appellees\u2019 argument<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> fails because a review of the 1962 and 1965 hearings shows plainly that Congress was not adequately informed that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>the Secretary was excluding from burial anyone made eligible by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">For the 1962 hearings, held by the Subcommittee on National Parks of the House Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs,<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> a background report was prepared. That report, Committee Print No. 15 \u2014 \u201cData on National Cemeteries,\u201d<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> focused, as did the hearings,<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> on the overall problem created by the fact that the number of persons eligible for burial exceeded by millions the number of available grave sites. The Subcommittee wished to examine possible solutions to this problem, such as opening more cemeteries or curtailing the categories of persons entitled to the privilege.<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> Its chairman, at the opening of the hearings, asked the witnesses to \u201cconfine their testimony to the general situation\u201d <footnotemark>70</footnotemark> and, as might be expected, the felony exclusion rule, affecting only a small number of cases, was not brought up in testimony or questioning. Correspondingly, Committee Print No. 15 barely touched on the felony exclusion. Only the then current regulation, comprising one short paragraph, appeared in the midst of 18 pages of background data on the subject at hand \u2014 the gap between supply and demand of interment facilities.<footnotemark>71</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">On the other hand, the Subcommittee was presented much more prominently with testimony indicating that burial was well-nigh automatic. As the Army\u2019s representative at the hearings stated, in response to a question by the chairman of the Subcommittee, \u201c[eligibility for burial in the Arlington National Cemetery is determined by law. We have no control over that.\u201d <footnotemark>72</footnotemark> Later, in discussing the especially acute problem of lack of space in Arlington National Cemetery, Representative Taylor asked about the requirements for burial there:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-8\">\u201cMr. Hughes [Assistant Director for Legislative Reference of the Bureau of the Budget]: * * * I think eligibility relates solely to the fact of military service and an honorable discharge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-9\">* * * * -X- *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-10\">\u201cMr. Taylor: Then any veteran, honorably discharged veteran, that desires to be buried at Arlington could, upon request, be buried there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-12\">\u201cMr. Hughes: Yes, sir.\u201d <footnotemark>73</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-13\">Thus, the 1962 hearings, as a vehicle to bring the Secretary\u2019s claim of power to the attention of Congress, stands in sharp contrast to factual situations wherein courts have found ratification by acquiescence.<footnotemark>74</footnotemark> Given the relative unhelpfulness of the felony exclusion regulation to the hearing\u2019s inquiry, its brief mention in a large report, the inconsistent testimony,<footnotemark>75</footnotemark> and the failure of anybody to note the inconsistencies or even to speak of the regulation, we cannot say that its existence was brought sufficiently to the Subcommittee\u2019s attention.<footnotemark>76</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b221-14\">Similarly, we must reject appellees\u2019 claim that the felony exclusion policy was brought to the attention of Congress in hearings held in 1965 by the House <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs.<footnotemark>77</footnotemark> These hearings, lasting seven days, concerned the activities of the Department of Interior. As that department and the Army had cooperated in the operation of some cemeteries,<footnotemark>78</footnotemark> a part of one day\u2019s hearings was devoted to a briefing on national cemetery policy by an officer of the Quartermaster Corps.<footnotemark>79</footnotemark> In response to a question, this officer referred to one section \u2014 not the felony exclusion section \u2014 of Committee Print No. 15.<footnotemark>80</footnotemark> He offered to supply a copy to the Committee, but there is no indication that this was done before adjournment.<footnotemark>81</footnotemark> The hearing proceeded to another subject, and Committee Print No. 15 was never again mentioned.<footnotemark>82</footnotemark> The adjournment took place a short while later,<footnotemark>83</footnotemark>,so that even if the document was distributed to the Committee generally, in the circumstances it is unlikely that any member would have had an opportunity to identify the brief paragraph on felony exclusion, let alone examine its possible significance.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">Finally, appellees would have us find congressional ratifications of the Secretary\u2019s felon exclusion practice in the passage since 1947 of appropriation bills for the maintenance of the national cemeteries. But ratification by appropriation, no less than ratification by acquiescence, requires affirmative evidence that Congress actually knew of the administrative policy.<footnotemark>84</footnotemark> As we said recently, \u201cratification by appropriation is not favored and will not be accepted where prior knowledge of the specific disputed action cannot be demonstrated clearly.\u201d<footnotemark>85</footnotemark> Moreover, to constitute ratification, an appropriation must plainly show a purpose to bestow the precise authority which,is claimed.\u201d<footnotemark>86</footnotemark> That Congress supports financially the operation, of the national cemeteries does not imply that it supports every aspect of their administration by the Army.<footnotemark>87</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b222-16\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b222-17\">While a \u201cright clearly created by statute cannot be taken away by regulation,\u201d<footnotemark>88</footnotemark> when the statutory meaning is in doubt \u201c[t]he interpretation placed on [it] by those charged with its administration,\u201d whether or not ratified or acquiesced in by the legislature, \u201cmust be given weight. * * * \u201d<footnotemark>89</footnotemark> Just how much weight will, however, depend upon the presence of a number of factors which \u201cgive it power to persuade, if lacking power to control.\u201d <footnotemark>90</footnotemark> Many such factors are absent here \u2014 so many as to leave us unconvinced that we should bow to the Secretary\u2019s interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>Administrative construction is less potent than it otherwise would be where it does not rest upon matters peculiarly within the administrator\u2019s field of expertise.<footnotemark>91</footnotemark> It. could hardly be suggested that the Secretary is more capable than the Congress to decide who should be buried in national cemeteries. Moreover, the Secretary\u2019s <em>ex parte </em>ruling before us is \u201cnot entitled to the weight which is accorded interpretations by administrative agencies entrusted with the responsibility of making <em>inter partes </em>decisions.\u201d<footnotemark>92</footnotemark> And an administrative interpretation of a statute carries its greatest thrust \u201cwhen it involves a contemporaneous construction of a statute by the men charged with the responsibility of setting its machinery in motion; of making the parts work efficiently and smoothly while they are yet untried and new.\u201d<footnotemark>93</footnotemark> The Army\u2019s felony exclusion policy was initiated 65 years after the national cemeteries were established, and 54 years after the passage of the act which appellees claim first gave them discretion over eligibility for burial.<footnotemark>94</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">Equally important, the reasoning behind the felony exclusion policy sounds more like administrative invention \u2014 witness the extension of burial privileges to relatives<footnotemark>95</footnotemark> \u2014 than statutory construction. \u201cAdministrative determinations must have a basis in law\u201d and their force depends heavily on the validity of the reasoning in the logical bridge between statute and regulation.<footnotemark>96</footnotemark> Here, although the Army has asserted the power to exclude otherwise eligible veterans since 1927<footnotemark>97</footnotemark> and has promulgated regulations to that effect since 1947,<footnotemark>98</footnotemark> the basis upon which it relied for this power remained at best obscure until this litigation - arose. The administrative history of the felony exclusion provides us with but four clues: two statements by the Assistant Secretary of War written in 1927 and 1928, a letter transited to the American Legion in 1944, and a study by the general counsel of the Quartermaster Corps in 1950. And we find that only one document, the letter to the American Legion, evinces a definite attempt at statutory interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-15\">Replying to an inquiry from the American Legion, the Army, on August 17, 1944, wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-16\">\u201c[Regarding the burial in a national cemetery of an honorably discharged World War I veteran who subsequently committed a felony and died in a State Penitentiary, please be advised that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>the policy of the Department is to deny burial to such veterans for the following reasons:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-4\">\u201c1. The prerequisites for burial in a national cemetery are that the deceased must be a citizen of the United States and must have served his country honorably;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-5\"><em>\u201c2. </em>A person who commits a felony is not considered as having served his country honorably and, upon his commitment to a penitentiary, loses his citizenship thereby depriving him of all privileges of a citizen, including burial in a national cemetery and the furnishing of a Government headstone to mark his grave.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">This response, badly misreading the statute, makes several critical errors of law. Congress made an \u201chonorable discharge\u201d from the Armed Forces, not subsequent service of one\u2019s country \u201chonorably,\u201d a prerequisite for burial. The words are similar, but obviously the meanings are very different. There is no statutory requirement that veterans of the Armed Forces of the United States seeking burial in national cemeteries be citizens;<footnotemark>99</footnotemark> and aside from the question whether such a condition could be read into the statute, felons do not, as a general rule, lose their citizenship.<footnotemark>100</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">The same errors are also reflected in the earlier 1928 statement by the Assistant Secretary of War. He wrote that where an otherwise eligible veteran \u201ccommitted an offense which resulted in his conviction of a felony and confinement in a penitentiary (and forfeiture of his citizenship), that fact would serve to forfeit his right to burial in a national cemetery.\u201d Thus he too apparently saw commitment to a penitentiary as necessarily depriving a veteran of citizenship and robbing him of burial rights by legal forfeiture, not by exercise of the Secretary\u2019s discretion.<footnotemark>101</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b224-13\">The Army\u2019s 1950 policy and legal study apparently continued to interpret the cemetery statute to reject noncitizens, but recognized that conviction for a felony generally does not deprive one of citizenship. The Nationality Act of 1940<footnotemark>102</footnotemark> and its successor<footnotemark>103</footnotemark> did, however, purport to revoke the citizenship of those convicted of desertion in wartime, treason, or attempt to overthrow the government. Correspondingly, from this study emanated a decision to deny burial in eases where loss of citizenship resulted from conviction of any of these crimes. We need not decide whether such a regulation would be valid, or would serve to exclude Thompson, because conviction for a crime resulting in loss of citizenship was not the basis for the Secretary\u2019s action.<footnotemark>104</footnotemark> But it is clear that the reasoning evolving in the 1950 study in no way supports a rule excluding all felons, or a rule keyed to the length of the felon\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-14\">Whether or not a result of the 1950 study, when the 1947 cemetery regula<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>tions first appeared in the Federal Register in 1951,<footnotemark>105</footnotemark> the provision excluding felons was omitted. Then in 1952, inquiry was made as to the eligibility for burial of an individual awaiting execution in a state penitentiary. According to an affidavit submitted on behalf of appellees, \u201cthe Secretary of the Army directed the preparation of a regulation for immediate adoption which would prevent such individual from being interred in a national cemetery. * * *\u201d The changed regulation,<footnotemark>106</footnotemark> in essence, barred burial of persons convicted of any crime \u201cthe result of which was loss of United States nationality or the maximum penalty for which was death or fifteen years or more imprisonment.\u201d The record indicates nothing as to the authorization, if any, the Secretary relied upon in promulgating this regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">In sum, we discover weaknesses in the proffered administrative construction that would in any event militate against its acceptance. More crucially, we find from the cited evidence a course of action for which the administrators sometimes gave fallacious justifications, and at other times no justification at all. These circumstances in combination lead us to the conclusion that, to the extent that the Army\u2019s exclusionary practice purports to construe the congressional specifications for burial in national cemeteries, it is entitled to no weight in this litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">By congressional command, \u201c[a]ny * * * former member of the Armed Forces who served on active duty * * * and whose last such service terminated honorably\u201d may be buried in a national cemetery.<footnotemark>107</footnotemark> The question we have addressed is whether a soldier honorably discharged after active duty can, for later conviction of felony, be denied that privilege \u201c[u]nder such regulations as the Secretary of the Army may * * * prescribe.\u201d<footnotemark>108</footnotemark> The statutory language, read liberally, foretells a negative answer, and the legislative history of the statute, as we have seen, strongly supports that answer<footnotemark>109</footnotemark> We conclude that Congress did not empower the Army to determine who are or are not worthy of interment in national cemeteries.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-12\">Robert G. Thompson served actively in the Army for nearly two years, and earned his honorable discharge. Though he later became a felon, he remained an honorably discharged veteran of the Pacific campaigns. We hold that the Army could not properly prevent burial of his remains in a national cemetery.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-13\">In so deciding, we do not intimate that Congress sought thereby to condone criminality. We discern only an absence of congressional purpose to superimpose upon the criminal law a forfeiture of the burial privilege as an added deterrent to antisocial activity. Within the limits of the Constitution, it is for Congress to weigh the gains and losses consequent upon a deprivation of civil privileges as a method for regulating conduct. But where Congress has willed that course, it has spoken in unmistakable terms.<footnotemark>110</footnotemark> And here, very significantly, we think, it did not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-14\">We reverse the judgment of the District Court, and remand the case for fur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>ther proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"A6k\">.

The reference of record to the Secretary\u2019s grounds is contained in the Army\u2019s letter to appellant confirming the Army\u2019s conclusion \u201cthat the ashes of your late husband * * * may not be buried in a national cemetery\u201d and stating that \u201c[t]he basis for this determination is set forth in the * * * opinion by the Attorney General.\u201d See <em>supra </em>note IS. The Attorney General viewed, as the sole bases for the Secretary\u2019s action, the provisions of the 1965 and 1966 regulations withdrawing the burial privilege from those convicted of crimes resulting in a sentence of five years or more, and to these provisions we are confined on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"AjR\">We note, however, that there arc two other proscriptions contained in the regulations which the Secretary thus discarded as predicates for his action. First, the 1966 regulations refuse burial to those convicted under the Smith Act, as was Thompson. See note 15, <em>supra. </em>Second, both the 1965 and 1966 regulations deny that privilege to those convicted of crimes \u201cthe result of which is the loss of United States citizenship or nationality.\u201d Like its successor, 66 Stat. 268 (1952), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1481(a) (9), Section 401(h) of the Nationality Act of 1940, 54 Stat. 1169 (1940), provides for loss of nationality upon conviction for \u201cattempting by force to overthrow * * * the United States,\u201d and the gravamen of Thompson\u2019s Smith Act offense was conspiracy to advocate the violent overthrow of the United States government. In the past, the Army apparently took the position that Congress itself had made veterans who lost their citizenship ineligible for burial. See text <em>infra </em>at notes 99-104. But, since the Attorney General\u2019s opinion never mentioned the loss of nationality provision, and expressly disclaimed reliance on the Smith Act provision, they are beyond the purview of this litigation. \u201c[A]n administrative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>order cannot be upheld unless the grounds upon which the agency acted in exercising its powers were those upon which its action can be sustained.\u201d SEC v.

Thus, we do not pass upon such questions as whether Congress made non-citizens ineligible for burial, or undertook to take away Thompson\u2019s citizenship, compare 68 Stat. 1146 (1954), or whether, if it did, such a forfeiture of citizenship could be constitutionally accomplished.

The chief of the Memorial Division of the Quartermaster Corps was unable to determine whether a policy of excluding felons existed prior to 1906, and his search of the records between 1906 and 1926 produced no written evidence of any policy to that effect. The earliest denial of burial on the basis of a felony conviction that he found occurred in 1927. Thus, whether or not there were exclusions before 1906, the 21-year hiatus between 1906 and 1927 indicates that the modern-day practice of excluding felons had an independent start in 1927. The national cemeteries were established in 1862, note 25, <em>supra, </em>and appellees rely heavily on the act of 1873, note 27, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"35\">\n<p id=\"b217-9\">.

We conclude similarly as to legislation enacted in 1920, upon which appellees place reliance. Congress then updated the law so that citizens who served with the armed forces of countries allied with the United States would be eligible for burial in national military cemeteries. 41 Stat. 552 (1920). This addition distinguished between veterans who had served the United States during wartime or had died destitute after peacetime service, on the one hand, and United States citizens who had previously served with the forces of a wartime ally, on the other. Those within the first class became eligible for burial simply upon production of honorable discharge papers, but the consent of the Secretary of War was made prerequisite to burial of those falling within the second class. Without legislative history available to enlighten us \u2014 and there is none\u2014 we fail to see how this legislation helps appellees\u2019 position. Rather, if it has any significance at all, it seems to add substance to appellant\u2019s argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"37\">\n<p id=\"b217-16\">. \u201cThe authority for the burial of wives and widows was granted in 1890 and for minor children and unmarried adult daughters in 1904 and 1908, respectively.

It has not been shown that either the Army\u2019s exclusionary practice or the cemetery regulations issued by its Secretary were made available to Congress at the time the 1948 changes were pending. The general cemetery regulations were not published in the Federal Register until after the passage of the 1948 revisions. See 16 Fed.Reg. 11914-18 (1951). The regulation excluding felons was not published until the following year.

The Quartermaster General recommended to the Assistant Secretary of War that the individual be refused burial in Arlington National Cemetery or any other national cemetery by reason of his felony conviction, albeit he was otherwise entitled to such burial. This recommendation was concurred in by the Assistant Secretary of War on the grounds of the peculiar atrocious nature of the crime for which he will be executed. For this reason, the remains of this veteran were excluded from burial in Arlington National Cemetery.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"102\">\n<p id=\"b224-16\">. 54 Stat. 1169.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"103\">\n<p id=\"b224-17\">. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1481(a) (9).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"104\">\n<p id=\"b224-18\">.

The Constitution places the control of these properties of the United States in the Congress:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-7\">The Congress shall have power to dispose of and to make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory or other Property belonging to the United States; * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">U.S.Const, art. IV, \u00a7 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-9\">Thus, the executive branch of the Government has only such authority over the national cemeteries as is delegated to the Executive by the Congress. It was natural for the Congress to delegate to the Secretaries authority to formulate regulations for the maintenance and administration of the cemeteries. In doing this the Congress at the same time described the persons whose remains could be buried there. The remains of Robert G. Thompson come within the persons described. The Secretaries accordingly lack authority to exclude them. The grant to the Secretaries of regulatory authority essential to the maintenance and administration of the cemeteries would seem to demonstrate that this responsibility of the Secretaries is not one to create classes which exclude the remains of some of those whose remains have been designated in the same legislation as eligible for burial.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-10\">The problem of legislative ratification is fully covered by Judge Robinson. To support the position of the Secretaries on this branch of the case would extend the theory of ratification to cover prior legislative approval of unknown, and un-ratified, classifications from time to time made by the Secretaries within the particular classifications the Congress has itself made by duly enacted legislation.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b226-11\">BURGER, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"A3o\">(concurring in part and dissenting in part):</p>\n<p id=\"b226-12\">I cannot join in the reasoning of the court that \u201cthe Secretary lacked power to exclude Thompson\u2019s remains from interment in a national cemetery * * * [because] * * * Congress conferred upon the decedent a right to burial * * * unconditioned by the Secretary\u2019s exercise of judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b226-14\">Congress, on the contrary, specifically provided that the right was conditioned by \u201csuch regulations as the Secretary of the Army may * * * prescribe * * * \u201d 24 U.S.C. \u00a7 281. I suggest that the majority is simply substituting its personal views of public policy for the policy decisions of the Legislative and Executive branches of government \u2014 and unnecessarily so because of narrow grounds to the same end. Neither the language of the statute nor its legislative history warrants the majority\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-16\">I would reach the result achieved by the majority on the narrow ground that the Secretary made an overly and unnecessarily broad interpretation of his own regulation governing those sentenced to 5 year prison terms. The rationale behind such cut-off points is traditionally to single out those offenses which are so serious that they result in long-term sentences. To cumulate sentences as the Secretary does here brings within the scope of the regulation those individuals who, although they have been sentenced for substantial terms, have no single sentence of 5 or more years. I have very grave doubts that an exclusion can be justified by adding up the total of sentences to bring a case under the five year provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-17\">I would therefore remand the case to the Secretary with directions to reconsider his action in light of our view of his application of the regulation to <em>separate </em>sentences, each of which was for less than 5 years.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
