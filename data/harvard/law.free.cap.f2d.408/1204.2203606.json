Freeman, 125 U.S.App.D.C. 207, 370 F.2d 229 (1966), which held invalid the \u201cnearby dif<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1205\">*1205</page-number>ferential\u201d provision of the New York-New Jersey federal milk order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-5\">We hold that appellant Freeman, Secretary of Agriculture, has standing to contest the award. In the interest of justice and being advised in the premises we vacate the order of the District Court and enter our own award.</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-6\">1. The District Court\u2019s order provided for payment of a $300,000 fee award out of an escrow fund of approximately $550,000. That is the fund that was established in accordance with an order of this court of December 9, 1966. That order stayed the transmission of this court\u2019s opinion for a 90-day period, available for filing a petition for cer-tiorari, and permitted Secretary Freeman, then appellee, to make payments to milk producers after deducting the sums needed to make \u201cnearby differential\u201d payments, but required that such sums be held in an interest-bearing escrow account until further order of the court. The fund grew to its $550,000 size in the two months that elapsed before February 8, 1967, when the Government decided that certiorari would not be brought, and the nearby differential provision would be terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-15\">This court\u2019s order of February 28, 1967, remanded to the District Court to consider, <em>inter alia, </em>the application for attorney\u2019s fees.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1261-16\">2. The District Court\u2019s fee order of August 16, 1967, states, <em>inter alia, </em>that the Secretary of Agriculture \u201chas no legal interest\u201d in the escrow fund \u201cor resulting standing to interpose objections to its distribution other than as a stakeholder of such funds under order of the Court of Appeals or in an advisory capacity.\u201d Appellees have moved to dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1206\">*1206</page-number>miss the Secretary\u2019s appeal for lack of standing. Their motion is denied. Where litigation involving federal programs comes to involve questions of attorney\u2019s fees the cognizant federal official has an interest in the fee award as well as the merits of the litigation even though, or assuming, the fee does not decrease funds in the Treasury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-4\">This has been indicated without discussion or debate in rulings of this court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We think it is one aspect of the interest of Government officials in the programs they administer, an interest that is not to be narrowly and technically confined so as to limit presentation to courts of issues they consider to have significance in terms of their overall responsibilities as public officials.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1262-5\">3. We have decided, for various reasons, to set the fee directly, rather than remand for an evidentiary hearing of the kind we previously contemplated.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1262-6\">Our objective is to proceed in accordance with equitable principles so as to reward the attorneys whose service in stopping an unauthorized payment has been of benefit to the class of private persons involved, and to the public interest in observance by administrative and executive officials of statutory limitations on their authority.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1262-12\">A fair fee to such counsel must take into account its necessarily contingent nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-13\">On the other hand, the underlying principles of equity that are applicable require us to take into account some limitations on the fee that might otherwise be payable- \u2014 apart from the difficulty in quantifying the benefit <em>(supra </em>note 4). While counsel\u2019s diligence and resourcefulness in evolving a general approach merit appropriate commendation, we would be less than candid if we failed to note that a significant aspect of the research required for the prior opinion had to be undertaken by this court, and that the sharpness of tone and approach in various submissions diluted the assistance available from counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-14\">The statement by counsel as to amounts of time devoted to the case, which appellant characterized as amounts that appear on their face to be questionable, were accepted in an abbreviated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1207\">*1207</page-number>procedure without providing for eviden-tiary testing by appellant. In cases like these, time is a relevant though not decisive consideration.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We do not think it necessary to have an exact finding on this point beyond the general finding of the District Court that.-substantial time was devoted to the case over a period of two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b1263-5\">Having due regard to the various factors involved and equitable considerations applicable, it is our conclusion that the fee should be set at a sum below the $300,000 figure proposed by counsel, but above the $50,000 minimum which appellant conceded would not be objectionable. We conclude that appellees should be awarded attorney\u2019s fees of $185,000, plus out-of-pocket expenses of a kind customarily reimbursed to counsel, and remand for entry of an appropriate order.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1263-6\">Remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1261-7\">. The order provided (Order and Memorandum of the U.S. Court of Appeals in Blair v. Freeman, No. 19,801, Feb. 28, 1967):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1261-8\">\u201c3. As to the funds that are now al-locable to non-nearby producers, their counsel resist distribution because of their claim as counsel to attorneys\u2019 fees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1261-9\">\u201cWe see no occasion for extensive review of the principles governing fee allowances. These principles have been recently and fully described in Schmidt v. McCarthy, 125 U.S.App.D.C. 131, 369 F.2d 176 (1966) ; Bakery Union v. Ratner, 118 U.S.App.D.C. 269, 335 F.2d 691 (1964), on appeal from remand, 122 U.S.App.D.C. 372, 354 F.2d 504 (1965). The reasonable value of services must take into account the extent (time) and nature of service (difficulty of work and persistence); complexity of issues; and distinctive contribution (if any). These are considered in the framework of benefits conferred on the class.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1261-12\">\u201c4. The matter is one that can best be resolved by the District Court rather than this Court in view of the nature and range of the dispute presented.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1261-13\">\u201cThus appellee says that the fee requested is out of all proportion to the services of appellants\u2019 counsel. Appel-lee further states that appellants\u2019 counsel, though victorious, have conducted the litigation with unnecessary and unseemly invective.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AiNA\">\u201cAppellee raises the question whether appellants\u2019 counsel have produced the fund, in any realistic sense, since it developed solely out of the need for consideration of certiorari by the Solicitor General, that there would have been no fund if appellants\u2019 counsel had been victorious to the point of instant acquiescence by the Government, and that the lesser victory may not generate a fund for fees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ANHe\">\u201cOn the issue of benefit, appellee notes that many producers who fall in the legal category of non-nearby producers were not benefited by the litigation and indeed actively opposed it as being to their detriment, taking all aspects of the financial impact into account. Our opinion noted that the nearby differential may have resulted in a benefit to non-nearby producers (slip op. p. 18).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ACf1\">\u201c5. In the circumstances we are of the view that the court\u2019s outstanding order should be amended to permit immediate distribution of the moneys that would have been payable to nearby producers, with interest earned thereon. The fund earmarked for non-nearby producers will be subject to the disposition of the District Court, for allowance of such fee as it may deem appropriate and remittance of the balance to the non-nearby producers pro rata.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1262-7\">.

Prominent among these is the consideration that this court is best situated to appraise the worth of counsel\u2019s services in providing assistance in the salient decision making.\u2019 It also appears that the inquiry which this court contemplated would be made in the District Court \u2014 an analysis of the benefit rendered the class \u2014was not made, and is apparently too complicated to warrant protracted investigation. It should be noted, however, that the benefit to the non-nearby producers cannot be found on an adding machine by adding up their increase in receipts. It appears that at least some producers whose payments would be increased by discontinuance of the nearby differential thought their overall interest lay in maintaining nearby producers in the pool, apparently to assure an increased pot even with a smaller share.</p>\n<p id=\"Ah1x\">If, on the one hand, receipt of escrow funds by a producer does not necessarily establish that he benefited from discontinuance of the differential, it is also true, as the District Court observed, that a milk producer advantaged by termination of the differential was given a benefit extending into the future, over and above the short period following this court\u2019s order, when the escrow fund was established.</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-17\">Monetary benefit is not decisive, since a fee is often payable when the benefit cannot be translated into dollar terms. The difficulty here is that the District Court assumed that the amount of the escrow fund was a minimum and indisputable benefit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1262-18\">.
