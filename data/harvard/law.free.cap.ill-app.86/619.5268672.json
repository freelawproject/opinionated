He started from Chicago between eight and nine o\u2019clock p. m. at the last date, having in his card case, which he carried in his pocketbook, $135. There were two sleepers in the train, but only one conductor for the two sleepers. Appellant took a berth in one of the sleeping cars, and after the conductor had taken up his ticket he went into the smoking room of the car, where there were other persons. Afterward, and while he was in the smoking car, the conductor came there and asked him if he could change a twenty dollar bill. Appellant looked at his money, the conductor standing in the doorway of the smoker, and told him no. When appellant was about to retire for the night, he put his money in his card case, put the card case in his pocketbook, and the pocketbook in his vest, doubled up his vest, and threw it under his pillow in the berth where he slept. He slept in the lower berth. When he awoke in the morning he threw the-pillow aside and looked for his pocketbook, but it was gone.</p><p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b628-4\" pgmap=\"628\">Appellant had traveled more or less for about twelve years on the Illinois Central Eailroad, and had, for about seven or eight years next prior to the time in question, passed one or two nights each week in a Pullman sleeper. He says the practice as to keeping watch at night on the Pullman cars was, that the conductor stayed up till three o\u2019clock in the morning, when he went to bed, and the porter of the car then got up. He also testified that the porter is allowed to black shoes for the passengers, and that when he arose in tbe morning his shoes were \u201c shined.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b628-5\" pgmap=\"628\">The case was first tried in a justice\u2019s court, and next in the County Court, on appeal from the justice. The judgment was for appellee on each trial. The case was tried in the County Court by the court, without a jury, by agreement of the parties.</p><attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b628-6\" pgmap=\"628\">Lorenzo C.

N. Y., N. H. &amp; H. R. Co., 26 S. E. R. 277.</p> <p id=\"b629-6\" pgmap=\"629\">To the same effect is Pullman Car Co. v. Smith, 73 Ill. 360. Hone of the cases cited by appellant is to the contrary.</p> <p id=\"b629-7\" pgmap=\"629\">It is true, as contended by appellant\u2019s counsel, that direct proof of negligence is not necessary; that it may be inferred from facts and circumstances in evidence; but the court, whose province it was, sitting as a jury, to exercise the functions of a jury as to the facts, has found that the facts do not justify the inference that appellant\u2019s money was lost by reason of appellee\u2019s negligence, and the sole question presented for decision is, whether this finding is manifestly against the evidence. We can not say that it is. On the contrary, we think it sustained by Pullman Pal. Car Co. v. Smith, supra. The judgment will be affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
