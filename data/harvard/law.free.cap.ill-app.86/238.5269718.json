That appellee guaranteed that such machines should be capable of turning out a certain amount of work in a given time. That the machines delivered to appellants were not such as were provided for and not capable of the work specified by the terms of the guaranty. That by reason thereof the machines were returned to and accepted by appellee. That by reason of breach of the contract by appellee appellants have sustained damages. That appellee has begun suits against appellants upon the promissory notes given on account of payment for the machines; that one of such suits was begun and is pending in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois; and that two of such suits are pending in courts of justices of the peace in said county. That other suits upon other of the promissory notes are threatened by appellee. Alleges that appellants have no adequate remedy in law. Prajs that appellee be enjoined from prosecuting the suits at law, and in effect that the court set off the damages sustained by appellants against the claims of appellee upon the notes. By amendment to the bill of complaint it is alleged that appellee is a resident of the State of Hew Jersey and not amenable to process of the courts of this jurisdiction.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b248-6\" pgmap=\"248\">Upon general demurrer by appellee to the amended bill of complaint, the court below, sustaining the demurrer, dismissed the bill for want of equity.</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b248-7\" pgmap=\"248\">From that decree this appeal is prosecuted.</p><attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b248-8\" pgmap=\"248\">F.

C. P. S. Exchange v. McClaughrey, 148 Ill. 372; Commissioners v. Green, 156 Ill. 504; Jones v. The Chester Co., 17 Ill. App. 111; Cleland v. Campbell, 78 Ill. App. 624; 1 High on Inj., Secs. 61-62.</p> <p id=\"b248-12\" pgmap=\"248(33) 249(30)\">Hor can it be maintained upon the ground of equitable set-off. The only claim of set-off presented by the allegations of the bill is such as might result from a breach of warranty of the quality of the articles sold. In a suit for the purchase price of the articles this claim, can be set off. Babcock v. Frice, 18 Ill. 420.</p> <p id=\"b249-4\" pgmap=\"249\">It is not alleged that appellee is insolvent. . There was, therefore, an adequate remedy at law, and there is no ground for the intervention of relief in equity. The non-residence of appellee is unimportant, for he had, by beginning the suit in the Circuit Court of Cook County, brought himself within the reach of appellants in this behalf.</p> <p id=\"b249-5\" pgmap=\"249\">In that suit brought by appellee against appellants to recover on the promissory notes given for purchase price, appellants may plead their claim of set-off, arising by reason of the breach of the warranty of the machines, and thereby obtain full relief in law.</p> <p id=\"b249-6\" pgmap=\"249\">The learned trial judge properly sustained the demurrer. The decree is affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
