Farlin Q. Ball, Judge, presiding. Heard in this court at the March term, 1899.</summary><disposition data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"AbA\" pgmap=\"201\">Reversed and remanded with directions.</disposition><decisiondate data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"ACy\" pgmap=\"201\">Opinion filed December 14, 1899.</decisiondate><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b201-14\" pgmap=\"201(16) 202(161)\">Statement toy the Court.\u2014About December 4,1885, Catherine Mallory purchased of Puller and others the premises in controversy in this case, and received a warranty deed therefor to her of that date, and being indebted to William Eiley in the sum of $356.10, to secure the same, delivered to said Eiley the warranty deed, and also executed a writing under seal stating in substance that she had borrowed said amount from Eiley on December 4,1885, and had delivered to him said warranty deed, to be by him held in escrow, and not to be recorded till said amount should be repaid within three years, and that she thereby agreed and bound herself, her heirs and assigns, so to do. No separate note or writing evidencing the debt to Eiley was made. Neither the warranty deed nor said writing were ever recorded, and there was indorsed on the back of said sealed writing the following: \u201cTransferred to Wm. Skakel, June 21, 1895. Wm. Eiley;\u201d also, \u201c Transferred to Mary F. Mallory, Dec. 17, 1895. Wm. Skakel.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b202-7\" pgmap=\"202\">The premises in question were a lot and cottage of the value of $1,500, and were occupied from the date of the warranty deed by Catherine Mallory as her homestead until the time of her death, which was January 9, 1898. Appellant was a nephew of said Catherine, lived with her for twenty-five years prior to her death, supported her, and paid all taxes and special assessments upon the property in question, amounting to about $325, and also paid for repairs and improvements upon it, $269.</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b202-9\" pgmap=\"202(129) 203(209)\">Catherine Mallory had two sons, Michael F. Mallory, the husband of appellee, and John Mallory, neither of whom lived with their mother nor contributed to her support, though said Michael, as he testified, had plenty of money and was a money maker. July 28, 1896, said Catherine conveyed said real estate by quit claim deed to appellant, and by quit claim deed bearing the same date appellee and her husband also conveyed to appellant the same premises. In the latter deed \u201c Michael F. Mallory and Mary F. Mallory, his wife,\u201d are named as grantors. The consideration expressed in the deed is ten dollars, but it appears that nothing was paid by appellant for the deed. Appellant testifies that the deed was made at the suggestion of Michael Mallory, because the latter said that he and his wife wanted to arrange that appellant have the property, and that they said they thought he was entitled to it. Appellee testified that she signed the deed willingly; *\u201c my dower right, that is all I signed away.\u201d Michael F. Mallory testified that when the deed was made he told appellant, \u201c here is a chance, you make out an instrument and I will sign it\u2014sign away my interest in the land there. I have plenty of money and am a money maker, and therefore I don\u2019t want anything more to do with the property.\u201d Appellant testifies that he knew of the indebtedness of Catherine Mallory to Riley, but did not know of the writing held by Riley at the time that appellee and her husband made the deed to him. Appellee testified that appellant did know of the existence of the mortgage, but her testimony shows that she only heard that he knew of it from others. She says she never presented it to appellant for payment. Michael F. Mallory testified that appellant knew of the mortgage before it was transferred to Skakel, and before his and appellant\u2019s quit claim deed to appellant, but this appellant denies.</p><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b203-4\" pgmap=\"203\">At the time appellee and her husband made the quit claim deed to appellant, as she testified, she was the owner of the mortgage to Riley.</p><p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b203-5\" pgmap=\"203\">Appellee filed her bill, setting up said written instrument executed by Catherine Mallory to Riley, and its deposit, together with the warranty deed, with him as security, the transfer to Skakel, and appellee claiming that it was a mortgage for the indebtedness to Riley, and asking that it be declared a lien on said real estate for the amount due thereon, and in default of payment that the property be sold. Appellant answered the bill and set up, among other things, the conveyances by Catherine Mallory to him of said real estate, and also of Michael F. Mallory and appellee to appellant, and that by the latter deed appellee conveyed all her right, title and interest in said premises to appellant.</p><p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b203-6\" pgmap=\"203(10) 204(110)\">After replication the cause was referred to a master to take proof and report his conclusions. The master reported the facts substantially as above stated, concluded that said instrument in writing from Catherine Mallory to Eile^y and its deposit, together with the warranty deed, with Eiley, constituted a mortgage in his favor, and that the same was owned by appellee, she having received it by assignment through the indorsements thereon as above stated, and recommended a sale of the real estate for the amount found due to January 1, 1899, being $544.48. Exceptions to the repfbrt were overruled, the report confirmed and a decree entered by the chancellor in conformity thereto. From this decree the appeal herein is taken.</p><attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b204-5\" pgmap=\"204\">Frank H.

It may be effected by a reconveyance. Eelease may be made of the whole or a part of the mortgaged premises by a quit claim deed from the mortgagee to the mortgagor. 2 Jones on Mort. (4th Ed.) 972.</p><p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b204-7\" pgmap=\"204\">And in it the estate of a mortgagee of land is a legal estate which passes by the same instruments of conveyance as other legal estates. Welsh v. Priest, 8 Allan (Mass.), 165.</p><p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b204-8\" pgmap=\"204\">Where land is conveyed in mortgage, and no separate obligation is given for payment of the money, a deed of-quit claim of the land from the mortgagee to a stranger is sufficient to assign the mortgage and all the rights and interests under it. Dorkray v. Noble, 8 Me. 278.</p><p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b204-9\" pgmap=\"204\">The same rule applies where the debt has not been assigned. Welsh v. Phillips, 54 Ala. 309.</p><p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b204-10\" pgmap=\"204\">A conveyance by the mortgagee, by quit claim deed or otherwise, operates as an equitable assignment of the debt.

Jewell, 31 Me. 306.</p><p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b204-12\" pgmap=\"204(9) 205(34)\">A conveyance by the mortgagee would convey all the right the mortgagee had in the premises, which is a conditional fee, and also operates as an equitable assignment of the mortgagee\u2019s interest in the debt. Lawrence v. Stratton, 6 Cush. 163.</p><p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b205-4\" pgmap=\"205\">A mortgage is not assignable at law by mere indorsement, as in the case of commercial paper, but on the other hand the estate and interest of the mortgagee may be conveyed to a third party by deed with apt words of conveyance, and the fact that it is in form an assignment makes no difference. Barrett v. Hinckley, 124 Ill. 45.</p><p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b205-5\" pgmap=\"205\">A conveyance by a mortgagee discharges the mortgage. Hussey v. Hill, 120 N.

Enc. of Law (2d Ed.), 123.</p><p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b205-9\" pgmap=\"205\">Where the language employed when read in the light of the surrounding circumstances clearly expresses an intention of charging the land with the payment of money, although the agreement may not operate as a mortgage at law, the intention of the parties will be effectuated by enforcing it as an equitable mortgage. Peckham v. Haddock, 36 Ill. 38.</p><p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b205-10\" pgmap=\"205\">Where the equitable owner of the land assents, in writing, that the holder of the legal title to the same may hold the title as security for the money borrowed by such owner of a third person, this will be sufficient to create an equitable lien on the land for the benefit of his creditor. Chadwick v. Clapp, 69 Ill. 119.</p><p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b206-4\" pgmap=\"206\">Where a mortgage has been made and no separate obligation given for the payment of the money secured by the mortgage, an assignment of the mortgage transfers all the rights and interests under it. 2 Am. &amp; Eng.

Peckham v. Haddock, 36 Ill. 38; Chadwick v. Clapp, 69 Ill. 119.</p> <p id=\"b206-9\" pgmap=\"206\">This mortgage is in equity assignable, and was, by the indorsements on the written instrument set out in the statement preceding this opinion, assigned to, and the title thereto in equity was thereby vested in, appellee. 2 Jones on Mort., Sec. 457; Barrett v. Hinckley, 124 Ill. 44-6.</p> <p id=\"b206-10\" pgmap=\"206(98) 207(24)\">Appellee, being the owner of the mortgage in question, as well as the debt secured by it, there being no note or other evidence of the debt aside from the mortgage, upon the 28th day of July, 1896, by her quitclaim deed of that date, voluntarily made by her, conveyed all her right and interest as mortgagee in the real estate in question to appellant. This deed was in equity a release of the mortgage interest of appellee. Dorkray v. Noble, 8 Mo. 278; Welsh v. Priest, 8 Allan (Mass.), 165; 2 Jones on Mortg. (2d Ed.) Sec. 972; Waters v. Waters, 20 Ia. 363-7; Hussey v. Hill, 120 N. C. 312; Woodbury v. Aikin, 13 Ill. 639-42; Barrett case, supra.</p> <p id=\"b207-4\" pgmap=\"207\">The contention that appellee, by her quit claim deed, only conveyed her dower, is not tenable. The owner of the fee at that time, Catherine Mallory, was living, and on the same day conveyed it to appellant. The husband of appellee had no right, title or interest in the real estate, and therefore appellee had no right of dower, inchoate or otherwise. The only right or interest which appellee had at this time was her interest as mortgagee. This interest, in the light of the evidence and the condition of the title at that time, she no doubt intended to and did effectually convey to appellant by her deed to him. A deed is always to be construed not only with reference to its words, but in the light of the circumstances existing at the time it was made and the relations of the parties to the title. Lake Erie, etc., R. R. Co. v. Whitman, 155 Ill. 514; Elgin City Bkg. Co. v. Center, 82 Ill. App. 405-12, and cases there cited.</p> <p id=\"b207-5\" pgmap=\"207\">The other contentions of counsel are not necessary to be considered. The decree of the Superior Court is reversed and the cause remanded, with directions to dismiss the bill for want of equity.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
