By reason of the operation the horse was so injured that it died. Appellee brought this suit to recover damages, alleging that the loss of the horse resulted from negligence and lack of skill upon the part of appellant. To the declaration appellant demurred. The declaration is formal and the only ground of demurrer was that the operation performed by appellant and described in the declaration,[is one which is prohibited by the statute. The demurrer ivas overruled. Upon the overruling of the demurrer an order was entered, which appears in the abstract of record as follows: \u201c Order to plead within ten days.\u201d Upon June 27, 1894, which was eleven days after the entry of the order to plead, appellant was defaulted. And on the 24th of May, 1895, a jury was impaneled to assess appellee\u2019s damages. Damages were assessed at $750, and a judgment thereon rendered. Subsequently a motion to vacate the judgment and to set aside the default was denied.</p><attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b626-9\" pgmap=\"626\">Edmund Furthmann, attorney for appellant.</attorneys><attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b626-10\" pgmap=\"626\">Sidney S.

It is sufficient to say, in disposing of this contention, that the act alleged in-the declaration as the ground of action, is laid at the date of June 3, 1891, and that the statute relied upon was approved upon June 17, 1891, and in force for the first time upon July 1, 1891.</p> <p id=\"b627-6\" pgmap=\"627\">The second contention is based upon an alleged lack of notice to appellant or his counsel of the inquest of damages. \"Without discussing the necessity of such notice, it is enough to say that the record does not disclose any such lack of notice. There is no bill of exceptions. From all that appears from the common law record we must presume that the proceedings were regular. Phillips v. Kerr, 26 Ill. 213; St. Louis &amp; S. E. Ry. Co. v. Wheelis, 72 Ill. 538; Magill v. Brown, 98 Ill. 235; Mullen v. The People, 138 Ill. 606. The judgment is affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
