The lease was signed as follows, after the signature of the lessor : \u201c The Boulevard Phoenix Club, by Milton A. Strauss, Pres.; Arthur Stein, Secretary. For rent due upon this lease, appellant brought this suit against Milton A. Strauss, Arthur Stein and fifteen others as co-defendants in an action of covenant. Each count of the declaration alleged that these defendants, \u201c pretending to be directors, officers and agents of '\u00a3 The Boulevard Club,\u2019 did assume to exercise corporate powers and to use the name of a pretended corporation without having theretofore1 complied with an act of the State of Illinois entitled, \u00a3 An Act Concerning Corporations,\u2019 being part of Chapter 32, \u00a1Revised Statutes of the State of Illinois, which prescribes and regulates the manner and means in and by which corporations may be lawfully organized and authorized to do business;\u201d each count sets out a failure to file in the office of the recorder of deeds of Cook county, in which county was located the principal place of business of said pretended corporation, a certificate from the Secretary of State of the State of Illinois, of the complete organization of such corporation; each count alleges that \u201c so assuming and pretending as aforesaid, the defendants did lease by indenture of lease from the plaintiff,\u201d etc.; and each count makes the written lease a part of the count. The defendants interposed demurrers to each count of the declaration. The trial judge sustained the demurrers as to each count, and, appellant electing to stand by her declaration, a judgment was entered against her for the costs, from which judgment this appeal is prosecuted.</p><attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b253-4\" pgmap=\"253\">Charles F.

Here the defendant has not engaged by deed to perform the covenants, and consequently covenant will not lie. Butnett v. Lynch, 5 Barn. &amp; C. 589; Moore v. House, 64 Ill. 162; R. R. I. &amp; St. L.

There was nothing to prevent a curing of the error in pleading after the demurrers had been sustained.</p> <p id=\"b254-7\" pgmap=\"254\">The judgment is affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
