The plaintiffs allege that they are \u201cshareholder-depositors\u201d in the defendant, Colonial Federal Savings and Loan Association ; that each of them was nominated for director on January 7, 1966; that a demand was made upon the association for a list of persons eligible to vote at the annual meeting on January 19; that the demand was ignored, a motion for adjournment was denied, and the directors proposed by the management were elected and certified. The Association moved to dismiss for lack of federal jurisdiction and failure to state a claim on which relief could be granted; plaintiffs then amended their complaint to add the directors elected at the meeting as defendants and in other respects not here material. Chief Judge Zavatt denied the motion to dismiss but stayed the action pending an \u00e1pplication by plaintiffs to the Federal Home Loan Bank Board for an administrative determination pursuant to 12 U. S.C. \u00a7 1464(d) (2) (A).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b659-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>On January 16, 1967, the Home Loan Bank Board adopted a resolution denying the application. A letter from its Assistant Secretary approved by the Board explained this on the highly technical \u2014 we are tempted to say hypertech-nical \u2014 ground that although plaintiffs\u2019 right to inspect the list had been judicially established in a case pending in the New York courts at the time of the election and finally determined a month thereafter, Murphy v. Colonial Federal Savings and Loan Ass\u2019n, 17 N.Y.2d 593, 268 N.Y.S.2d 348, 215 N.E.2d 525 (1966); see also Ochs v. Washington Heights Federal Savings and Loan Ass\u2019n, 17 N.Y.2d 82, 268 N.Y.S.2d 294, 215 N.E.2d 485 (1966), the gravamen of their petition to the Board was not that \u201ca right to <em>inspect </em>was sought or denied\u201d but that \u201ca demand was made <em>for a list </em>and was denied,\u201d see fn. 2 infra. Nothing daunted, plaintiffs moved for summary judgment. Judge Dooling granted the motion, holding that the complaint raised a question arising under the laws of the United States, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331; that the election was unfair because of the denial of plaintiffs\u2019 right to be informed of the electorate; and that the negative action of the Home Loan Bank Board did not bar judicial relief. Properly taking note of the problem of jurisdictional amount which apparently had not been raised by anyone, he thought that \u201cperhaps, it sufficiently appears since the matter in controversy is the right to participate ^effectively in the governance of the Association. Cf. Wahyou v. Central Valley National Bank, 9th Cir. 1966, 361 F.2d 755.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b659-4\">12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1464(a) authorizes the Federal Home Loan Bank Board to provide for the organization and operation of federal savings and loan associations \u201cunder such rules and regulations as it may prescribe.\u201d The Board\u2019s regulations, 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 544.1(4), provide that members may vote in person or by proxy. Question naturally arises whether a member desiring to enlist the aid of others in an election is entitled to find out who they are. Such an issue, which requires a fleshing out of the Board\u2019s regulations, is one of federal law. Cf. Illinois Steel Co. v. B. &amp; O. R.R., 320 U.S. 508, 510, 64 S.Ct. 322, 88 L.Ed. 259 (1944); Federal Reserve Bank etc. v. Atlanta Trust Co., 91 F.2d 283, 285, 117 A.L.R. 1160 (5 Cir. 1937); Durnin v. Allentown Federal Savings and Loan Ass\u2019n, 218 F.Supp. 716 (E.D.Pa.1963). This would become readily apparent if the common law of the state where the association operated denied members a right of inspection; Congress could hardly have intended that the rights of members of federal savings and loan associations to fair elections should vary with quirks of local law.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-8\">Appellants are mistaken in contending that federal jurisdiction is forbidden by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1349 providing that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-9\">\u201cThe district courts shall not have jurisdiction of any civil action by or against any corporation upon the ground that it was incorporated by or under an Act of Congress, unless the United States is the owner of more than one-half of its capital stock.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b659-10\">Although on a strictly literal approach, any controversy concerning the interpretation of a federal statute or regulation governing the internal affairs of a federal corporation could be said to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>grounded upon federal incorporation, such cases were not at all the \u201cmischief and defect\u201d at which the statute, \u00a7 12 of the Judges\u2019 Bill of 1925, 43 Stat. 936, 941, was aimed. The purpose rather was to stem \u201cthe flood of litigation to which the federal courts were * * * subjected\u201d as a result of the decision in Pacific Railroad Removal Cases, 115 U.S. 1, 5 S.Ct. 1113, 29 L.Ed. 319 (1885), that every action by or against a federal corporation presented a federal question, see Hart &amp; Wechsler, The Federal Courts and the Federal System, pp. 730, 752 (1953), by generalizing the earlier legislation, 38 Stat. 803 (1915), which had prohibited railway corporations from resorting to the federal courts because of a federal charter. As Mr. Justice Van Devanter explained to the Senate Judiciary Committee, the bill extended \u201cthe railroad section so as to cover any kind of Federal corporation. If there happens to be some other ground for taking the case into a federal court, it can go there. But federal incorporation alone is not enough.\u201d Frankfurter &amp; Landis, The Business of the Supreme Court, 272-273, fn. 55 (1927). It is immaterial that the state courts also may deal with the internal affairs of federal savings and loan associations, as the New York courts did in the cases cited above; when they do this, they are nonetheless applying federal law. See Local 174, Teamsters etc. V. Lucas Flour Co., 369 U.S. 95, 82 S.Ct. 571, 7 L.Ed.2d 593 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-8\">Since the district court was plainly right in holding that an election of directors in which the opposition is deprived of any reasonable opportunity to ascertain the names and addresses of electors known to the management was unfair under federal law,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> we pass to appellants\u2019 contention that the Home Loan Bank Board\u2019s resolution denying the petition precluded judicial- relief. Chief Judge Zavatt properly stayed the action pending application to the Board under 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1464(d) (2) (A), when he found that this recently enacted provision authorized the agency to issue a notice of charges both in the case of the election, compare Reich v. Webb, 336 F.2d 153 (9 Cir. 1964), and in that of the refusal to allow inspection of a membership list.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Far East Conference v. United States, 342 U.S. 570, 574-575, 72 S.Ct. 492, 96 L. Ed. 576 (1952). But this section permits the Board to use its discretion in deciding whether or not to act on an application for relief, and does not suggest that its refusal to issue a notice of charges would prevent a complainant from seeking judicial relief that would be otherwise obtainable. The argument that the plaintiffs are barred thus must rest on a eon-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>struction of two other parts of \u00a7 1464 also enacted in 1966. Section 1464(d) (7) (B), quoted in the margin,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> provides for review of the Board\u2019s cease and desist orders in the courts of appeals, but is silent as to review of the Board\u2019s refusal to institute a proceeding, and \u00a7 1464(d) (8) states that \u201cexcept as otherwise provided in this subsection no court shall have jurisdiction to affect by injunction or otherwise the issuance or enforcement of any notice or order under this subsection, or to review, modify, suspend, terminate, or set aside any such notice or order.\u201d Although both provisions regulate judicial review only when the Board has issued a cease and desist order, Colonial\u2019s argument would require us to infer from this statutory framework a congressional intention to preclude citizens from exercising their ordinary judicial remedies. The impropriety of any such construction appears <em>a fortiori </em>from decisions that provision for review of certain types of federal administrative action does not without more prevent review of other types under the general equity jurisdiction of the district courts. Stark v. Wickard, 321 U.S. 288, 307-308, 64 S.Ct. 559, 88 L.Ed. 733 (1944); Toilet Goods Ass\u2019n v. Gardner, 360 F.2d 677, 683-684 (2 Cir. 1966), aff\u2019d 387 U.S. 167,87 S.Ct. 1526,18 L.Ed.2d 704 (1967), and Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 139-141, 87 S.Ct. 1507, 18 L.Ed.2d 681 (1967); cf. Fahey v. Mallonee, 332 U.S. 245, 256, 67 S.Ct. 1552, 91 L.Ed. 2030 (1947).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Moreover, a consideration of the legislative history of the Financial Institutions Supervisory Act, of which the amendments were a part, demonstrates that the proposed interpretation would be inconsistent with the reasons for enactment of the statute. That history makes Congress\u2019 central concern clear \u2014 \u201cThe Federal supervisory agencies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>in varying degrees have been seriously handicapped in their efforts to prevent irresponsible and undesirable practices by deficiencies in the statutory remedies. Experience has often demonstrated that the remedies now available to the Federal supervisory agencies are not only too drastic for use in many cases, but are also too cumbersome to bring about prompt correction and promptness is very often vitally important.\u201d Sen.Rep. No. 1482, 89th Cong., 2d Sess. (1966), 3 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News, pp. 3532, 3537(1966). With the need for speed in view, Congress carefully limited the occasions on which judicial control of administrative action was procurable, see also 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1464(d) (3) (B). Its effort to create an effective system of sanctions would be hampered rather than forwarded by reading these provisions to paralyze the judiciary when the agency has refused to act.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">The question of jurisdictional amount is more difficult than the judge thought. For reasons indicated in the margin, if 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 were the only source of federal jurisdiction, we should be obliged to remand for further findings, as we did in Wolff v. Selective Service Local Board No. 16, 372 F.2d 817, 826 (2 Cir. 1967), whether the requisite monetary interest could be shown.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> However, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1337, which does not require a monetary minimum in \u201cany proceeding arising under any Act of Congress regulating commerce,\u201d provides an alternative source of jurisdiction. As stated in Professor Bunn\u2019s influential book on Jurisdiction and Practice of the Courts of the United States 71-72 (1949), although when \u201cthe words were used in 1911 \u2018acts regulating commerce\u2019 pretty clearly meant \u2018The Act to Regulate Commerce,\u2019 \u201d the phrase had come to mean \u201call acts whose constitutional basis is the commerce clause.\u201d See Imm v. Union Railroad Co., 289 F.2d 858 (3d Cir, 1961) (Goodrich, J.), citing many decisions of the past several decades, see 289 F.2d at 860 fn. 3.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Commentators have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>unanimously approved this liberal construction, since the amount involved is normally of little relevance to the desirability of federal jurisdiction in federal question cases. See ALI Study of the Division of Jurisdiction Between State and Federal Courts 200-203 (4th tent, draft 1966); Wright, Federal Courts 92 (1963); Friedenthal, New Limitations on Federal Jurisdiction, 11 Stan.L.Rev. 213, 217-218 (1959); Wechsler, Federal Jurisdiction and the Revision of the Judicial Code, 13 Law and Contemporary Problems 216, 225-26 (1948). The broad construction that had been given \u00a7 1337 was inferentially approved by the 1958 Congress that raised the jurisdictional amount in federal question and diversity cases to $10,000 \u2014 \u201cWhile this bill applies the $10,000 minimum limitation to cases involving Federal questions, its effect will be greater on diversity cases since many of the so-called Federal question cases will be exempt from its provisions. This is for the reason that Federal courts are expressly given original jurisdiction without limitation as to the amount claimed in a great many areas of Federal law. * * * When all of these types of cases are eliminated, the only significant categories of \u2018Federal question\u2019 cases subject to the jurisdictional amount are suits under the Jones Act and suits contesting the constitutionality of State statutes. In both of these types of cases the amount claime4 usually exceeds $10,000.\u201d S.Rep. No. 1830, 85th Cong., 2d Sess., 2 U.S.Code Cong &amp; Ad.News 3099, 3103 (1958).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b663-4\">It is true that federal regulation of finance is not grounded in the commerce power alone. As Chief Justice Hughes explained in Norman v. B. &amp; O. R. R., 294 U.S. 240, 303, 55 S.Ct. 407, 414, 79 L.Ed. 885 (1935):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-7\">The broad and comprehensive national authority over the subjects of revenue, finance and currency is derived from the aggregate of the powers granted to the Congress, embracing the powers to lay and collect taxes, to borrow money, to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the several states, to coin money, regulate the value thereof, and of foreign coin, and fix the standards of weights and measures, and the added express power \u201cto make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution\u201d the other enumerated powers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b663-8\">See also McCulloch v. State of Maryland, 17 U.S. (4 Wheat.) 316, 406, 4 L.Ed. 579 (1819). But to found jurisdiction upon \u00a7 1337, it is not requisite that the commerce clause be the exclusive source of Federal power; it suffices that it be a significant one. And whether or not a distinction between \u00a7\u00a7 1331 and 1337 is called for when the federal law invoked as a basis for jurisdiction is wholly non-statutory save in the sense that the authority for its creation lies in the Constitution, a treaty, or act of Congress \u2014 a point ventilated but not decided in T. B. Harms Co. v. Eliscu, 339 F.2d 823, 828 (2 Cir.), cert, denied, 381 U.S. 915, 85 S.Ct. 1534, 14 L.Ed.2d 435 (1965), and McFaddin Express, Inc. v. Adley Corp., 346 F.2d 424, 427 (2 Cir. 1965), cert, denied, 382 U.S. 1026, 86 S.Ct. 643, 15 L.Ed.2d 539 (1966) \u2014 here the federal law asserted as the basis for jurisdiction is a regulation adopted by a government agency under authority of an \u201cAct of Congress.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b663-10\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b658-9\">. This provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-10\">\u201cIf, in the opinion of the Board, an association is violating or has violated, or the Board has reasonable cause to believe that the association is about to violate, a law, rule, regulation, or charter or other condition imposed in writing by the Board in connection with the granting of any application or other request by the association, or written agreement entered into with the Board, or is engaging or has engaged, or the Board has reasonable cause to believe that the association is about to engage, in an unsafe or unsound practice, the Board may issue and serve upon the association a notice of charges in respect thereof. The notice shall contain a statement of the facts constituting the alleged violation or violations or the unsafe or unsound practice or practices, and shall fix a time and place at which a hearing will be held to determine whether an order to cease and desist therefrom should issue against the association. Such hearing shall be fixed for a date not earlier than thirty days nor later than sixty days after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>service of such notice unless an earlier or a later date is set by the Board at the request of the association. Unless the association shall appear at the hearing by a duly authorized representative, it shall be deemed to have consented to the issuance of the cease- and-desist order. In the event of such consent, or if upon the record made at any such hearing the Board shall find that any violation or unsafe or unsound practice specified in the notice of charges has been established, the Board may issue and serve upon the association an order to cease and desist from any such violation or practice. Such order may, by provisions which may be mandatory or otherwise, require the association and its directors, officers, employees, and agents to cease and desist from the same, and, further, to take affirmative action to correct the conditions resulting from any such violation or practice.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b660-4\">. Although appellants have made no point of it, we note that the judgment directed Colonial to furnish plaintiffs\u2019 attorney with a list of member and borrower depositors eligible to vote. While the only right generally recognized at common law was to inspect the books, Guthrie v. Harkness, 199 U.S. 148, 26 S.Ct. 4, 50 L.Ed. 130 (1905), more than twenty states have passed \u201cshareholder voting list statutes,\u201d many modeled on \u00a7 29 of the Model Business Corporation Act, see Note, Shareholder Voting List Statutes \u2014 Are They Effective?, 26 U. of Cinn.L.Rev. 288 (1957). See also Rule 14a-7 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. It seems quite appropriate to adopt as \u201cfederal common law\u201d a principle that has achieved such widespread recognition, see New York, N. H. &amp; H. R.R. v. R. F. C., 180 F.2d 241, 244 (2 Cir. 1950); United States v. Wegematic Corp., 360 F.2d 674, 676 (2 Cir. 1966), as the right of a stockholder with a legitimate purpose to inspect a list available to management or, if he prefers, to have one furnished on paying the cost of making it.

The permissive and discretionary nature of the Board\u2019s power under 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1464(d) (2) (A) argues against a view, not here urged, that the remedy for refusal to issue a notice of charges lies in an action against the Board in the District Court under the analogy of United States v. Interstate Commerce Comm\u2019n, 337 U.S. 426, 69 S.Ct. 1410, 93 L.Ed. 1451 (1949). Compare cases denying such a remedy for refusal to issue charges by the General Counsel of the NLRB \u2014 Hourihan v. NLRB, 91 U.S.App.D.C. 316, 201 F.2d 187 (1952), cert denied 345 U.S. 930, 73 S.Ct. 792, 97 L.Ed. 1359 (1953); Retail Store Employees Union Local etc. v.

It seems much more likely that Congress intended parties to be able to pursue their ordinary remedies in the courts, with the court having the Board\u2019s reason for inaction before it and giving tlrs such weight as was considered appropriate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b662-5\">. If the complaint had contained a formal allegation that the matter in controversy exceeded $10,000 exclusive of interests and costs, as apparently it did in the <em>Wahyou </em>case on which the judge relied, see 361 F.2d at 756, and defendants had not \u201ctraversed\u201d this, all would have been well since there were no allegations to \u201cqualify or detract from it in such measure that when all are considered together it cannot be fairly said that jurisdiction appears on the face of the complaint * * KVOS, Inc. v. Associated Press, 299 U.S. 269, 277, 57 S.Ct. 197, 200, 81 L.Ed. 183 (1936). But here there was no such allegation \u2014 indeed not even a statement as to the amount of plaintiffs\u2019 deposits or stock ownership\u2014 and, apart from the court\u2019s own obligation to take note of the problem, the issue was thus sufficiently raised by defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of \u201cjurisdiction of the subject matter of this action.\u201d We are unable to follow the judge\u2019s belief that the required amount \u201csufficiently appears since the matter in controversy is the right to participate effectively in the governance of the Association,\u201d since, as thus stated, the right is hardly susceptible of monetary measurement. See Whitney v. American Shipbuilding Co., 197 F. 777 (E.D.Ohio 1911) (Day, J.); 1 Moore, Federal Practice 110.92 [5]. In view of our disposition of the case, it is unnecessary to decide whether the plaintiffs would be required to show that the difference to the value of their membership between management of the association by themselves and by the defendants exceeded $10,000, as the strict theory of the \u201cplaintiff viewpoint\u201d rule would indicate, see Central Mexico Light &amp; Power Co. v. Munch, 116 F.2d 85, 87 (2 Cir. 1940), but see Wright, Federal Courts, \u00a7 34, or whether it will suffice in cases such as this if plaintiffs, alone or with other members who may associate with them, see 1 Moore, Federal Practice $0.97 [3], can show an interest in the corporation worth more than the jurisdictional amount.

Professor Wright has argued that, in spite of this legislative history, Jones Act suits fall within the scope of \u00a7 1337, Federal Courts, supra, 92; he also points out that many suits contesting the constitutionality of state statutes can be brought under provisions, notably 28 U.S.O. \u00a7 1343, having no jurisdictional amount. Wliat remains important is that Congress\u2019 belief that very few federal question cases would be left under \u00a7 1331 must have assumed a continued broad construction of other sections.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
