The facts, the issues, and the basis of decision are fully set out in Judge Larson\u2019s opinion reported at 265 F.Supp. 1018. Judge Larson, in his well-reasoned opinion, has clearly demonstrated the invalidity of the taxpayers\u2019 basic contentions to the effect (1) the decision in Tellier v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 2 Cir., 342 F.2d 690, affirmed, Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Tellier, 383 U.S. 687, 86 S.Ct. 38, 15 L.Ed.2d 63, fixes the date of overpayment from which time for filing refund claim commences as of the date of the filing of the Tellier decision, and (2) the payment was made under mistake of law and the statute of limitations for filing refund claim is tolled until discovery of the mistake which occurred on the date of the Tellier decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-12\">Such contentions, which are reasserted upon this appeal, were properly rejected by the trial court for the reasons set forth in its opinion. We affirm upon the basis of the trial court\u2019s reported opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-13\">Taxpayers\u2019 additional contention that the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss is fatally defective because 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 7422(a) is not referred to in the motion lacks merit. A federal appellate court is required to investigate and determine its own subject matter jurisdiction as well as that of the trial court, whether or not the jurisdictional issue is raised by the parties. Subject matter jurisdiction cannot be waived. United States v. Rochelle, 5 Cir., 363 F.2d 225, 231; Kern v. Standard Oil Co., 8 Cir., 228 F.2d 699.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-14\">Twenty-six U.S.C.A. \u00a7 7422(a) has uniformly been interpreted as establishing a jurisdictional requirement that cannot be waived. The filing of a timely claim for refund is a prerequisite to the bringing of a tax refund suit. United States v. Felt <em>&amp; </em>Tarrant Mfg. Co., 283 U.S. 269, 273, 51 S.Ct. 376, 75 L.Ed. 1025; United States v. Rochelle, supra; United States v. Frauenthal, 8 Cir., 138 F.2d 188, 192; 10 Mertens Law of Federal Income Taxation, \u00a7 58A.06. It is established here beyond dispute that the refund claim was not filed within the time interval required by \u00a7 6511(a). The suit was properly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-15\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
