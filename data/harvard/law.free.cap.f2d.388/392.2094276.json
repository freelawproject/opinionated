Hooper seeks reversal, relying primarily on Vick v. United States, 5 Cir. 1954, 216 F.2d 228, which held that mere presence at a still and attempted flight from a raid is insufficient evidence to sustain a conviction for these crimes. See also United States v. Romano, 1965, 382 U.S. 136, 86 S.Ct. 279, 15 L.Ed.2d 210. However, where there is additional proof, the jury\u2019s conclusions of guilt may be warranted. McFarland v. United States, 5 Cir. 1960, 273 F.2d 417. We find from the following facts sufficient evidence \u201cfrom which the jury may infer guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Id. at 419:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aja-dedup-0\">(1) Before his attempted flight Hooper was surrounded by 90 one-gallon glass jugs containing whiskey, a tub containing approximately five gal-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>Ions of whiskey, and a truck containing fifteen gallons of whiskey;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-4\">(2) All of the whiskey in the glass jugs and the tub was hot; expert testimony advises that immediately after the distilling process whiskey is hot;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-5\">(3) Hooper wore boots with a distinctive thread design identical to that imprinted in the ground in and around the still yard;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-6\">(4) Hooper was not wearing a jacket, and a jacket of his size, which was large, was discovered in the still yard;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-7\">(5) The distillery was complete in every detail, and contained three 846 gallon stills, of which two were filled with \u201clive\u201d mash and a third was boiling fermented mash.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">Our examination of the record convinces us that the other errors alleged are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
