We conclude that substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s finding that these employees were properly included in the bargaining unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\"> The Regional Director investigated the charges of election irregularities and found them to be without merit. The company\u2019s exceptions to his report show no substantial and material issues of fact that could be resolved only in a hearing. The company\u2019s request for review was denied by the Board. Under the circumstances, the Board was not required to hold an evidentiary hearing. Macomb Pottery Co. v. NLRB, 376 F.2d 450 (7th Cir. 1967). Nor was an evi-dentiary hearing required in the unfair labor practice proceeding. Cf. Pittsburgh Plate Glass Co. v. NLRB, 313 U.S. 146, 161, 61 S.Ct. 908, 85 L.Ed. 1251 (1941). Summary judgment was appropriate. Neuhoff Brothers, Packers, Inc. v. NLRB, 362 F.2d 611, 613 (5th Cir. 1966), cert, den., 386 U.S. 956, 87 S.Ct. 1027, 18 L.Ed.2d 106 (1967); NLRB v.
