Appellant premises his argument on the ground that the only government evidence presented was proof of his possession of the car in Missouri soon after its theft from a car lot in Illinois. Appellant does not dispute the settled law that such possession gives rise to permissible inferences of interstate transportation and guilty knowledge. See McIntosh v. United States, 341 F.2d 448 (8 Cir. 1965); Harding v. United States, 337 F.2d 254 (8 Cir. 1964); Travers v. United States, 118 U.S.App.D.C. 276, 335 F.2d 698 (1964); Jones v. United States, 378 F.2d 340 (9 Cir. 1967); cf. Wilson v. United States, 162 U.S. 613, 619, 16 S.Ct. 895, 40 L.Ed. 1090 (1896). He argues, however, that here no other evidence of any kind substantiated those inferences, and that therefore the proof was insufficient to warrant submission to the jury.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> See Van Gorder v. United States, 21 F.2d 939 (8 Cir. 1927); Torres v. United States, 270 F.2d 252, 258 (9 Cir. 1959); cf. Bollenbach v. United States, 326 U.S. 607, 66 S.Ct. 402, 90 L.Ed. 350 (1946). We affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-13\">Appellant\u2019s assertion that \u201cbare possession of the fruits of crime was the sum total of the government\u2019s evidence,\u201d is unwarranted. The evidence showed that the stolen vehicle, a white 1962 Thunderbird, was taken sometime between 5:00 p. m., on Saturday, August 20, 1966, and 9:00 a. m., on Monday, August 22, 1966, from a used car lot in Joliet, Illinois. The keys, locked in the car lot office, were not taken. Appellant was married in Ironton, Missouri, on Wednesday, August 24. He was seen by his new father-in-law driving a white 1962 Thunderbird, Illinois license No. HN9563, in Missouri on a Sunday in \u201clate August.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The witness said that he took down the license number since appellant and his daughter \u201cwere planning to be married and going away\u201d (on August 24) and he wrote down the license number in case he would want to contact them. There is thus a reasonable inference that this Sunday was August 21, within 24 hours of the time the car was last observed by its owner in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>Illinois. Although the evidence is somewhat ambiguous, there exists some proof that on the first day appellant was seen driving the car in Missouri he did not have any keys to the automobile.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Another circumstance substantiating the government\u2019s case took place on September 11, 1966. On that date the appellant left the car at a service station in Iron-ton, Missouri, ostensibly for repairs; he then obtained a ride to the train depot, mentioning that \u201che was going to Illinois.\u201d <em>The car was left at the station for a period of 20 days, </em>suggesting an abandonment by appellant. After that time passed, the service station operator called the Missouri State Highway Patrol, ultimately leading to the identification of the stolen vehicle and appellant\u2019s arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">Although the evidence presented is rather brief, nevertheless, in view of the favorable verdict, we must examine it in the light most favorable to the government. Thus, there was evidence of (1) appellant\u2019s possession of the stolen vehicle within 24 hours in a state other than its rightful owner\u2019s residence, cf. United States v. Kolakowski, 314 F.2d 699 (4 Cir. 1963); (2) operation of the stolen car without keys, cf. Brubaker v. United States, 183 F.2d 894 (6 Cir. 1950); (3) control of the automobile for 21 days, demonstrating at least putative ownership, and (4) abandonment in Missouri, cf. Platts v. United States, 378 F.2d 396 (9 Cir. 1967). We think it clear that the proof of possession did not stand unsupported and was sufficient to sustain the jury\u2019s finding of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b335-9\">. Appellant further urges that the failure of the trial court to sustain his motions for acquittal on this basis required him to assume the burden of proving his innocence. Cf. McAdams v. United States, 74 F.2d 37 (8 Cir. 1934). We find no merit in this claim. See Harding v. United States, supra, 337 F.2d at 257. Furthermore, we note that appellant does not question the trial court\u2019s instructions which properly charged the jury as to the burden of proof. Appellant\u2019s reliance upon the old rule governing circumstantial evidence is misplaced. This rule cited in Philyaw v. United States, 29 F.2d 225, 227 (8 Cir. 1928), that the circumstantial evidence necessary to sustain a conviction must be such to exclude every reasonable hypothesis but that of guilt of the accused, is no longer followed since Holland v. United States, 348 U.S. 121, 75 S.Ct. 127, 99 L.Ed. 150 (1954). See full discussion in McClard v. United States, 386 F.2d 495, pp. 507-509 (8 Cir. Dec. 4, 1967) nn. 5, 6, 7 (dissenting opinion).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b335-15\">.
