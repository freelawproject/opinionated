The government\u2019s evidence consisted almost entirely of the testimony of four admitted participants in the theft of a shipment of rugs which had been loaded on a truck in New York for delivery in Connecticut. Appellant asserts that the trial judge erred in instructing the jury as to the standard by which accomplice testimony should be evaluated and in refusing to charge that the crucial question in the case was not whether the theft had been committed but whether appellant was involved in the theft. It is also claimed that certain aspects of the prosecutor\u2019s conduct deprived appellant of a fair trial. We find no error and affirm the judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-19\">After instructing the jury that it might find from their testimony that any of four witnesses were accomplices, the trial judge charged as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-20\">\u201cAn accomplice does not become incompetent as a witness because of his participation in the criminal acts charged.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-21\">\u201cOn the contrary, if the only evidence on some or all of the essential elements of any count is the testimony of an accomplice, it may still be of sufficient weight, if you believe it, to sustain a verdict of guilty without corroboration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>\u201cYet bear in mind that accomplice testimony is to be received with caution and weighed with care. You should not convict on unsupported accomplice testimony unless you believe that testimony beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">Appellant contends that this instruction conveyed to the jury the impression that it need give no greater scrutiny to accomplice testimony than to any other testimony. We disagree. The trial judge\u2019s charge that accomplice testimony should be \u201creceived with caution and weighed with care\u201d was sufficient. Where charges on this subject have been stronger in their wording we have pointed out that they were more favorable to the defendant than the law required.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b418-17\">The judge\u2019s charge was entirely clear in instructing the jury that its task was to determine whether the defendants were guilty of the crimes, and not merely whether the crimes had been committed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b418-18\">Appellant argues that the prosecutor acted unfairly in calling Charles Zaher as a government witness and asking him only about his prior criminal record (which included convictions for possession of narcotics and petit larceny and a plea of guilty to a charge of bank robbery) and whether he knew the defendants and their alleged accomplices (to which Zaher replied in the affirma<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>tive). Zaher\u2019s testimony on direct examination if it stood alone would have no probative value and might have tended to prejudice the defendants by suggesting that they were associates of a criminal. However, since Zaher\u2019s name had been mentioned in earlier testimony, the defense undoubtedly would have asked the jury to draw an adverse inference if the government had not produced him. Moreover, the ground for claiming prejudice was eliminated when on redirect examination Zaher testified as to appellant\u2019s involvement in planning the crime with which appellant was charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">The prosecutor\u2019s summation is attacked as prejudicial and inflammatory. Appellant complains particularly of the prosecutor\u2019s urging the jury not to \u201cseparate\u201d defendants from the \u201cother crooks and thieves.\u201d This argument was to some extent responsive to the argument of co-defendant\u2019s counsel that defendants should not be grouped with the admitted criminals who testified against them. In light of this mitigating circumstance we hold that, although the prosecutor\u2019s remarks went to the limit of propriety, they were not sufficiently prejudicial to require reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b418-5\">.
