Leonardo Da Vinci on which he was an eastbound transatlantic passenger. Although process never issued against the ship, it was stipulated that the action should be deemed to be <em>in rem </em>as well as <em>in personam. </em>The Italian Line moved for summary judgment because of Sil-vestri\u2019s failure to comply with Article 30 of the Terms and Conditions of his ticket which we quote in the margin;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> an affidavit supporting the motion set forth Silvestri\u2019s admissions on deposition that he had the ticket in his possession for at least three days before board<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>ing the ship in New York and until he arrived in Italy, that he had looked at it prior to embarking, that he had consulted a lawyer in Italy who had made oral representations to the Italian Line without obtaining a satisfactory offer of settlement, and that he had given no written notice until the filing of the libel. Judge Metzrier granted the motion, apparently for failure to begin the action within one year, a contractual period of limitation sanctioned by 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 183b(a), and hence without having to consider whether Silvestri\u2019s failure to give written notice within six months would be ineffective as a bar because of being non-prejudicial in light of the alleged knowledge of the ship\u2019s master and the claim by the Italian attorney, 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 183b(b) (1). Sil-vestri\u2019s alternative arguments for reversal rest on the applicability of two Supreme Court decisions, The Majestic, 166 U.S. 375, 17 S.Ct. 597, 41 L.Ed. 1039 (1897), and The Monrosa v. Carbon Black Export, Inc., 359 U.S. 180, 79 S.Ct. 710, 3 L.Ed.2d 723 (1959), neither of which has been cited by counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-4\">We find no merit in Silvestri\u2019s contention that even if the conditions were incorporated as the judge held, Article 30 did not cover a suit <em>in rem. </em>In <em>The Monrosa </em>the Supreme Court held a clause in a bill of lading which we quote in the margin<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> inadequate to bar an <em>in rem </em>proceeding in the United States. The decision is fairly distinguishable on several grounds. The Court stressed, 359 U.S. at 182, 79 S.Ct. at 712, that \u201cthe initial words\u201d \u2014 presumably the reference not merely to the Shipowners but to the Captain and the Agents \u2014 \u201care particularly appropriate to a restriction of the clause to <em>in personam </em>actions, and the rest of the language is intelligible on this premise.\u201d Here the language is different, and we can discern no intelligible purpose to be served by provisions for filing claims and starting suits that would apply only to <em>in personam </em>actions and leave the claimant free to attach the ship. The Court leaned also on another clause in the bill of lading which had referred both to the carrier and the ship, 359 U.S. at 182 fn.*, 79 S.Ct. at 712; here there are no such clauses, the ticket is studded with provisions referring only to \u201cthe Company,\u201d and \u2014 perhaps decisively\u2014 Article 32 recites:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-10\">\u201cAll the regulations, limitations and exceptions relating to the responsibility. of the Company are understood to apply also to the responsibilities, if any, of its Agents, <em>its vessels, </em>its Masters and crew, its employees and, generally, all persons who act for the Company.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b61-11\">Finally, the clause <em>sub judice </em>in <em>The Monrosa </em>encountered what the Fifth Circuit had characterized as \u201cone of the most universally recognized rules of law,\u201d namely, that \u201cwhich gives the right to libelant, possessing a maritime lien against a vessel, to proceed in rem in the jurisdiction where the vessel is found,\u201d 254 F.2d 297, 300 (5 Cir. 1958), quoting Motor Distributors, Ltd. v. Olaf Pedersen\u2019s Rederi A/S, 239 F.2d 463, 467 (5 Cir. 1957), and the Supreme Court also recognized this by its reference to The Maggie Hammond, 76 U.S. (9 Wall.) 435, 449, 450, 19 L.Ed. 772 (1869), which held that liens \u201cwill generally, although not universally, be respected and enforced in all places where the property is found or where the right can be beneficially enforced by the lex fori.\u201d See also Continental Grain Co. v. FBL-585, 364 U.S. 19, 21-27, 80 S.Ct. 1470, 4 L.Ed.2d 1540 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b61-12\">Silvestri can prevail, therefore, only if the judge erred in ruling that the conditions were incorporated, decision of which requires us to go back to <em>The Majestic. </em>That case stemmed from a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>misadventure of the Misses Potter who, with their maid, had sailed from Liverpool to New York in 1892. Despite the improvements in transatlantic navigation since the memorable voyage exactly four centuries earlier, the estimable young ladies found on disembarking that the contents of their trunks had been badly damaged by sea water. When they libelled the Majestic, they were met, among other defenses, with a ticket provision limiting liability \u201cfor loss of or injury to or delay in delivery of luggage\u201d to \u00a310. The ticket contained a \u201cbox\u201d bearing the names of the passengers, alongside which was an agreement of carriage signed by the Oceanic Steam Navigation Company. Underneath this was a \u201cNotice to Cabin Passengers\u201d with provisions not relevant to the issue save for a reference \u201cSee Back\u201d; on the back, under the rubric \u201cNotice to Passengers,\u201d like that on the front in bold face type, was a statement \u201cThis contract is made subject to the following conditions,\u201d including, in fine type, the limitation of liability for luggage to which we have referred. The attention of the Misses Potter had not been called to this, nor had either of them read it. In a unanimous opinion by Chief Justice Fuller, the Court allowed them to recover free from the limitation. Relying particularly on Richardson, Spence &amp; Co. v. Rowntree, [1894] A.C. 217, and Henderson v. Stevenson, L.R. 2 Sc. &amp; Div.App. 470 (1875), the Court held that the limitations \u201cwere not included in the contract proper, in terms or by reference.\u201d 166 U.S. at 385, 17 S.Ct. at 602.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">In an effort to meet the rule in <em>The Majestic, </em>which the Supreme Court has had no further occasion to elucidate, steamship companies have used various expedients to effectuate inclusion in the contract of the all too numerous conditions they appear to consider essential. Here the \u201cbox\u201d bore in the upper right hand corner the words:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-7\">Biglietto Di Passagio Passage Contract</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b62-8\">followed by an identifying number, and in the lower right hand corner the validating stamp of the issuing travel agent. Almost all of the captions in the \u201cbox\u201d were in capital or bold face letters, the major exception being the following statements, which appeared in the upper left hand corner of the ticket in - ordinary lower-case one-eighteenth inch type:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-9\">II presente biglietto di passagio e sog-getto alie condizioni stampate sulla co-pertina e sui fogli n\" 1 e 2.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-10\">Subject to the conditions printed on the cover of this ticket which form part of this contract.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b62-11\">The inconspicuousness of these statements was increased by the fact that they were squeezed immediately below a caption in bold face and to the left of one in capital letters. The two \u201cleaves\u201d which are an integral part of the coupon retained by the passenger were headed \u201cTerms and Conditions\u201d in bold face. Then followed 35 numbered paragraphs in very small print. At the end were spaces for signature by or for the passenger, but neither Silvestri nor any representative signed.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-12\">Judicial efforts to determine what suffices to meet the rule of <em>The Majestic </em>have produced distinctions of considerable nicety. The early decisions of this court ruled against incorporation. La Bourgogne, 144 F. 781 (2 Cir. 1906); The Minnetonka, 146 F. 509 (2 Cir. 1906); Smith v. North German Lloyd S.S. Co., 151 F. 222 (2 Cir. 1907).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>contrary line of authority finds its main doctrinal source in Murray v. Cunard Steamship Co., 235 N.Y. 162, 139 N.E. 226, 26 A.L.R. 1371 (1923). The Court of Appeals there enforced a 40 day notification requirement despite the fact that the passenger had apparently been required to surrender the ticket on board the ship. Judge Cardozo\u2019s opinion stated that \u201cThe plaintiff\u2019s ticket * * * is described in large type as a \u2018cabin passage contract ticket.\u2019 It provides, again in large type, that \u2018this contract ticket is issued by the company and accepted by the passenger on the following terms and conditions.\u2019 * * * At the top of the ticket is printed a notice \u2018The attention of passengers is specially directed to the terms and conditions of this contract.\u2019 \u201d On these facts, the court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-4\">\u201cThis is not a ease of a mere notice on the back of a ticket, separate either in substance or in form from the body of the contract. The Majestic, 166 U.S. 375, 17 S.Ct. 597, 41 L.Ed. 1039. Here the condition is wrought into the tissue, the two inseparably integrated. This ticket, to the most casual observer, is as plainly a contract, burdened with all kinds of conditions, as if it were a bill of lading or a policy of insurance. \u2018No one who could read could glance at it without seeing that it undertook * * * to prescribe the particulars which should govern the conduct of the parties until the passenger reached the port of destination\u2019 Fonseca v. Cunard S.S. Co., 153 Mass. 553, 27 N.E. 665, 12 L.R.A. 340. In such circumstances, the act of acceptance gives rise to an implication of assent.\u201d Id. at 166, 139 N.E. at 228.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">Despite the eminence of its authorship the <em>Murray </em>opinion did not at first have an enthusiastic reception in this court. Baer v. North German Lloyd, 69 F.2d 88 (2 Cir. 1934), involved a ticket which apparently referred to the conditions only in a heading located below the filled-in section. Pointing out that \u201cThese conditions were not referred to at all in the ticket proper which was duly signed in behalf of the defendant and which was the transportation contract binding upon the parties,\u201d the court said that <em>Murray </em>was distinguishable since the condition was there \u201cwrought into the tissue.\u201d Maibrunn v. Hamburg-American S.S. Co., 77 F.2d 304 (2 Cir. 1935), was a case where \u201cOn the face of the ticket, but at one side of the printing and writing which formed the contract proper, so far as there was one, was a legend reading as follows: \u2018Notice. The attention of passengers is especially directed to the terms and provisions of this contract printed on the reverse side, which must be signed by the passenger and the agent.\u2019 \u201d In refusing to enforce a notification provision, Judge L. Hand said that \u201conly the contract proper charges the passenger, and the contract is taken as those words which the carrier in some way authenticates by its own signature; notices and legends alongside are not part of it.\u201d A year later he found Bellocchio v. Italia Flotte Riunite, 84 F.2d 975 (2 Cir. 1936), where there was no notice at all on the face, to be an even stronger case in favor of the passenger. However, the <em>Bellocchio </em>opinion contained the first note of dissatisfaction with the whole doctrine, \u201cThe distinction is indeed somewhat formal and is not very satisfactory in theory, * * Nevertheless in <em>The Kungsholm, </em>86 F.2d 703 (2 Cir. 1936), where the \u201cprinted matter to the right of this \u2018box\u2019 is headed \u2018Cruise Contract\u2019 and states in large type, \u2018The following stipulations are a part of this contract which must be signed by the passenger <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>on the over-page immediately upon its receipt,\u2019 \u201d a divided court followed <em>Mai-brunn </em>in not enforcing a notification requirement, saying that \u201cthere is nothing above the carrier\u2019s signature to incorporate expressly or by reference any of these stipulations,\u201d although conceding this to be \u201ca very formal doctrine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">Baron v. Compagnie Generale Trans-atlantique, 108 F.2d 21 (2 Cir., 1939), was the first turn in the tide in this court. \u201cThe ticket was headed \u2018Passage Contract. Subject to the Terms Stated on This Page and Overpage.\u2019 Then came a blocked space across the page for the name of the steamer, ports, date of sailing, names of passengers, and ocean fares. Beneath the space were the words in prominent red type, \u2018Passengers should read the terms of the contract of carriage stated below and overpage, their particular attention being called to the limitations of liability therein contained.\u2019 This sentence was followed by the heading \u2018Terms of Contract \u2014 Read Before Accepting.\u2019 \u201d <footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The court held that \u201cIn the present case the form of the ticket shows unmistakably that the numbered paragraphs under the heading \u2018Terms of Contract\u2019 were incorporated textually into the contract of passage.\u201d This was because, unlike <em>The Kungsholm, </em>\u201cIn the present case the signature or authentication appears at the foot of the \u2018Terms of Contract,\u2019 and at no other place. Everything printed on the ticket rebuts the contention that the contract of carriage was restricted to the blocked space for names, dates and fares.\u201d While <em>Baron </em>itself would not avail the respondent since here the agent\u2019s validating stamp was in the box and the passenger never signed in the space provided below the terms and conditions, Foster v. Cunard White Star, 121 F.2d 12 (2 Cir. 1941), substantially abandoned the place of signature distinction by reading the terms and conditions back into the box so that they preceded the signature. This was predicated on \u201ca direct reference in the box on the face of the ticket to the terms and conditions of the contract.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Finally, Geller v. Holland-America Line, 201 F.Supp. 508 (S.D.N.Y.), aff\u2019d, 298 F.2d 618 (2 Cir. 1961), sustained a time limitation on a ticket whose \u201cbox\u201d contained a conspicuously placed legend \u201cSubject to the Terms op Passage Contract printed on the face hereof and continued overleaf, which terms are made a part of this contract,\u201d and the terms were headed by a box saying in bold face \u201cNOTICE: The attention of passengers is especially directed to the Terms of Passage Contract, which please read carefully.\u201d We held \u201cit is the settled law in this circuit that passengers will be bound by such a provision in the contract of carriage, if the provision is incorporated, at least by reference, in the body of the contract.\u201d 298 F.2d at 619.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-9\">The willingness to give effect to words sufficiently evidencing an intention to incorporate conditions in the contract of carriage exemplified in <em>Murray, Baron, Foster </em>and <em>Geller </em>may have been influenced by the disparity in the results with respect to steamship lines produced by the doctrine of <em>The Majestic </em>as against those attained by other carriers under the rule that valid limitations in tariffs filed with regulatory agencies of the United States are binding, whether embodied in the transportation documents, as in Adams Express Co. v. Croninger, 226 U.S. 491, 33 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>148, 57 L.Ed. 314 (1913), or not, as in Boston &amp; Maine R.R. v. Hooker, 233 U.S. 97, 34 S.Ct. 526, 58 L.Ed. 868 (1914); Galveston, Harrisburg &amp; San Antonio Ry. v. Woodbury, 254 U.S. 357, 41 S.Ct. 114, 65 L.Ed. 301 (1920); and Western Union Tel. Co. v. Esteve Bros. <em>&amp; </em>Co., 256 U.S. 566, 41 S.Ct. 584, 65 L.Ed. 1094 (1921) \u2014 despite the distinction that in the latter cases \u201cThe rate became, not as before a matter of contract by which a legal liability could be modified, but a matter of law by which a uniform liability was imposed.\u201d 256 U.S. at 572, 41 S.Ct. at 586. Doubtless courts have also come to recognize that substantive provisions such as those in 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 183b with respect to time periods for filing claims and bringing suit and \u00a7 183c invalidating exculpatory clauses for loss of life or bodily injury afford more effective protection than insistence on particular forms of words or type fonts.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-4\">However, the thread that runs implicitly through the cases sustaining incorporation is that the steamship line had done all it reasonably could to warn the passenger that the terms and conditions were important matters of contract affecting his legal rights. This was made explicit in the leading English case since those cited in <em>The Majestic </em>to consider whether a steamship ticket\u2019s terms and conditions are included in the passage contract, Hood v. Anchor Line (Henderson Brothers) Ltd., [1918] A.C. 837. There, the \u201cdocument or ticket was enclosed in- an envelope containing on the outside a finger pointing to the words \u2018Please read conditions of the enclosed contract.\u2019 * * * There was in prominent type on the face of the document the word \u2018Notice\u2019 followed by the words \u2018This ticket is issued to and accepted by the passenger subject to the following conditions.\u2019 * * * There is a further note in special type at the foot of the ticket: \u2018Passengers are particularly requested to carefully read the above ticket.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 847-48. The House of Lords held this notice sufficient to incorporate a condition on the ticket limiting the steamship line\u2019s liability for personal injuries to \u00a310. Lord Chancellor Finlay, stressing the \u201cconspicuous notice\u201d on the envelope, the \u201cconspicuous type\u201d of the notice above the conditions, and the capital letters of the statement at their foot, agreed with the trial judge who \u201cwas unable to conceive what further or better means the defenders could have employed to bring to the knowledge of passengers the existence of the contract conditions.\u201d Id. at 842. Viscount Haldane thought that while \u201cNo doubt the burden of proof lies on the respondents to show that they did all that was reasonably required in order to bring this condition to the notice of [the passenger\u2019s agent who purchased the ticket,] * * * the Courts below * * * have properly decided that they have.\u201d Id. at 845. Lord Dunedin, too, thought the trial court correct in finding \u201cthat the respondent did what was reasonably sufficient to bring to the appellant\u2019s notice the existence of the condition,\u201d id. at 847, as did Lord Parmoor, id. at 848-49.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-13\">How far the legend in the Italian Line\u2019s ticket alleged to effect incorporation fell below what could reasonably have been expected is sufficiently shown by contrasting it with the forms used by other steamship companies in the cases we have discussed. Nothing whatever was done to impress the importance of the terms and conditions upon the passenger. Indeed, although no point has been made of this, the English version is probably inadequate even from a literal standpoint since it refers only to \u201cthe conditions printed on the cover\u201d whereas Article 30 seems rather to have been on one of the sheets forming part of the passenger\u2019s coupon.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> While we would not insist on any particular rubric, seventy years of experience under <em>The Majestic </em>doctrine should have enabled the draftsman of the ticket to produce <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>a warning significantly more eye-catching than this. To be sure, it can be said that all this is legalism, since Sil-vestri should have known the Italian Line had not gone to the trouble of printing the Terms and Conditions for the fun of it and would not have read them no matter what was said; and we confess some doubt how far the intensity of ticket reading by steamship passengers correlates with the strength of the invitation to indulge in it. All this, however, could have been said with equal accuracy of the Misses Potter, yet <em>The Majestic </em>decided what it did. It may be argued also that the lawyer whom Silvestri consulted in Italy after he had discarded the ticket should have been aware that steamship tickets commonly contain limitations on the time for bringing suit, could have obtained a duplicate from the Italian Line to which he complained, and perhaps even did so. If the company can establish that because of the lawyer\u2019s advice or otherwise Silvestri knew that the ticket required him to bring suit within a year, we might have a different case. We hold only it was error to grant summary judgment for the respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b60-11\">. \u201cArticle 30\u00b0 \u2014 Limitation oe Action Against the Company. \u2014 No action or proceeding against the Company for death or injury of any kind to the passenger shall be instituted, unless written notice is given to the Company or its duly authorized Agent within six months from the day when the death or injury occurred and the action or suit arising therefrom is commenced within one year from the date when the death or injury occurred. No action or suit against the Company for loss or damage to baggage or for detention of the passenger or delay in landing or any other cause shall be instituted by the passenger unless written notice of the claim with full particulars be delivered to the Company or its duly authorized Agent at the port of debarkation within ten days from the date of landing, and such action or suit is commenced within six months after the termination of the voyage.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-19\">\u201cIn no case shall such action or suit be instituted after the above expiration of time notwithstanding any provision of law of any state or country to the contrary.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b61-5\">. \u201c27. \u2014 Also, that no legal proceedings may be brought against the Captain or Shipowners or their Agents in respect of any loss of or damage to any goods herein specified except in Genoa, it being understood and agreed that every other Tribunal in the place or places where the goods were shipped or landed is incompetent, notwithstanding that the ship may be legally represented there.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b62-5\">. In <em>La Bowrgogne </em>the ticket was not in evidence but it was found that the conditions were \u201cprinted on the back and that no one representing the petitioner called the attention of the holders of the tickets to the conditions on the back and that there is no proof that the passengers read the conditions.\u201d In <em>The Minnetonka </em>\u201cThe conditions on the back of the contract ticket * * * were printed in agate type, in double columns, and so compactly as to be almost illegible to one whose sight was at all imperfect. The claimant\u2019s agent * * * did not call [the libellant\u2019s] attention to the endorsements or ask her to read them, and she did not, in fact, read them.\u201d The district court opinion, 132 F. 52, 55 (S.D.N.Y. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>1904), adds that \u201cthe above conditions were printed, with others, underneath the words \u2018Notice to Passengers\u2019 in large clear type, and that below the conditions were certain blanks to contain information desired by the United States Revenue authorities, which were filled in by the libel-lant, or her representative.\u201d The court in the <em>Smith </em>case was \u201cunable to distinguish this case from The Majestic, 166 U.S. 375, 17 S.Ct. 597, 41 L.Ed. 1039, except that the notice is printed on the front, instead of the back, of the ticket.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b64-5\">.
