It usually employs seven truck drivers who pick up and deliver loads of hay from farmers.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-17\">An information containing multiple counts charged that between December 7, 1965 and February 14, 1966 the defendant \u201cknowingly and willfully\u201d failed to require four of its truck drivers \u201cto make, keep, and submit a driver\u2019s daily log; in violation of 49 CFR 195.1, 195.8; 49 U.S.Code 322(a).\u201d After a nonjury trial, the district court found the defendant guilty on all counts and assessed a fine.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-18\">According to the testimony of two safety inspectors with the Department of Transportation, inspections were conducted at the defendant\u2019s place of business in 1961, 1964, and 1965. The inspectors discussed with either the defendant\u2019s president or vice-president a number of failures to comply with the Interstate Commerce Commission regulation requiring the defendant\u2019s drivers to keep daily logs. On each occasion these failures to comply were acknowledged by one of the defendant\u2019s officers. A fourth inspection, conducted in March, 1966, revealed the absence of logs on which the instant prosecution is based.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-19\">Only the defendant\u2019s president and vice-president testified for the defense. Their combined testimony related to the length of time necessary to train drivers to haul hay (seven to ten months), the frequent admonitions and warnings to drivers to keep logs, the posting of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>notice to that effect in the time clock area, the formation of an insurance program, participation in which was conditioned on keeping logs, and the fact that three of the four drivers who had not kept logs left the defendant\u2019s employ voluntarily rather than comply with the regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-4\">The defendant\u2019s principal contention is that in a prosecution under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 322(a), the Government must prove actual criminal intent or a deliberate and obstinate refusal to comply with the applicable regulation. The words of the statute in question provide: \u201cAny person knowingly and willfully violating any * * * regulation, * * * \u201d shall be subject to a penalty. Since the offense is a misdemeanor and <em>malum, </em>;prohibitum, proof of specific criminal intent is not required. Steere Tank Lines, Inc. v. United States, 330 F.2d 719, 722, 723 (5th Cir. 1963); United States v. Lowther Trucking Co., 229 F.Supp. 812, 816 (N.D.Ala.1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">Uncontroverted evidence shows that the defendant\u2019s officers were knowledgeable of the logging regulation as the result of the inspections in 1961, 1964, and 1965. That these officers continued to employ drivers who failed to keep logs, knowing that to do so was in violation of the regulation, supports an inference that the defendant\u2019s conduct in question here was willful as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-8\">The defendant would have us read the word \u201crequire\u201d in 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 195.8 as synonymous with the word \u201crequest.\u201d According to the defendant, if a carrier requests his drivers to keep logs, he has complied with the regulation. We believe, however, that this interpretation would frustrate a requirement of the regulation \u2014 the keeping of daily logs. \u201cRequire\u201d suggests the authority and duty to impose sanctions for noncompliance and is not satisfied by a mere request.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-9\">We find no merit in the other contention raised by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-10\">The judgment of conviction is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
