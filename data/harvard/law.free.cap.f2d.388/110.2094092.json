They conclude that they did not have adequate assistance of counsel or a fair trial and that the District Court erred in not acting sua sponte on their behalf. We fail to see how action by trial counsel in any of these instances could have resulted in a favorable ruling or otherwise altered the result in appellants\u2019 favor. The cumulation adds neither weight nor substance. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>Nor do we think the district judge should on his own motion have granted a judgment of acquittal on behalf of either appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
