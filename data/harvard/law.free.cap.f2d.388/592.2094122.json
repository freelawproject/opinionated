Barry then gave the detective several sets of negatives; one of the sets pictured Barry exposed, standing behind the girl who was in a dance costume, blindfolded and holding a cardboard sign of obscene nature; the detective later obtained a search warrant and in its execution found photographs of nudes which \u201cform the basis factually\u201d for the indictment; prior to his arraignment Barry retained counsel who filed a motion in the Somerset County <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>Court of New Jersey challenging the validity of the arrest and seeking suppression of the seized photographs; the motion was denied; an interlocutory review of the denial of the motion was sought in the Appellate Division of the Superior Court of New Jersey<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which declined to hear the appeal; Barry then filed a \u201cMotion For Leave to Appeal\u201d in the Supreme Court of New Jersey which denied the motion \u201con the merits\u201d;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> thereafter prior to commencement of his trial, Barry, on application of his counsel, was granted permission to change his prior plea of not guilty to guilty and was sentenced to the terms he is now serving.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">No appeal was taken from the judgment of sentence, nor did Barry take any other action in the New Jersey courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">It must at this juncture be noted that the District Court was of the view that since Barry\u2019s motion to suppress the evidence had been \u201cdenied on the merits respectively by the Somerset County Court, the Appellate Division of the Superior Court and the New Jersey Supreme Court\u201d he had \u201cexhausted his remedies in the New Jersey courts on the issue of the legality of the search and seizure <em>per se, </em>Fay v. Noia, 372 U.S. 391 [83 S.Ct. 822, 9 L.Ed.2d 837] (1963)\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">It must further be observed that the District Court did not consider in its opinion the availability to Barry of the remedy afforded by the New Jersey post-conviction statute and that neither Barry nor the State of New Jersey, either below or here, gave consideration to that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">Whether \u201cavailable\u201d state remedies have been \u201cexhausted\u201d is a threshold question in every case in which a state prisoner seeks federal habeas corpus relief. United States ex rel. Romano v. Fay, 360 F.2d 389, 393 (2 Cir. 1966), cert. den. 385 U.S. 1020, 87 S.Ct. 725, 17 L.Ed.2d 557 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-12\">This Court has specifically held that \u201cIt is incumbent on federal courts to ascertain whether states afford an available remedy which has not yet been exhausted to correct an abuse of due process in the administration of their criminal laws\u201d. United States ex rel. Wilkins v. Banmiller, 325 F.2d 514, 519 (1963), cert. den. 379 U.S. 847, 85 S.Ct. 87, 13 L.Ed.2d 51 (1964).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b642-13\">It is settled that where a state has a post-conviction statute providing for consideration of petitions alleging denial of federal constitutional rights the state courts should be afforded opportunity to act with respect to the alleged denial. Case v. State of Nebraska, 381 U.S. 336-337, 85 S.Ct. 1486, 14 L.Ed.2d 422 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-14\">Further, a federal court will not assume that a state court will construe a state post-conviction statute \u201cso as to make it inadequate and ineffective\u201d, Bratt v. Crouse, 346 F.2d 146 (10 Cir. 1965), cert. den. 382 U.S. 932, 86 S.Ct. 324, 15 L.Ed.2d 343.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-15\">With these principles in mind, we turn to an examination of the New Jersey \u201cpost-conviction procedure\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-16\">Effective January 2, 1964, the Supreme Court of New Jersey adopted as part of its \u201cRules Governing Criminal Practice in the Superior Court and County Courts\u201d R.R. 3:10A-1 et seq., entitled \u201cPost-Conviction Relief\u201d. These rules provide a method by which \u201c[a]ny person convicted of a criminal offense may\u201d, under their terms, \u201cfile a peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>tion for post-conviction relief captioned in the cause in which the conviction was entered with the county clerk of the county where the conviction took place.\u201d R.R. 3:10A-1. Among the grounds listed in R.R. 3:10A-2 which may be asserted in the petition is a <em>\u201c [substantial denial in the conviction proceedings of defendant\u2019s rights under the Constitution of the United States </em>* * R.R. 3:10A-2(a). Other provisions of the rules contemplate a hearing. See, R.R. 3:10A-11 &amp; 3:10A-12. (emphasis supplied)</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">It is clear that Barry\u2019s allegations in his petition for a writ of habeas corpus, earlier detailed, amount to assertions of a \u201csubstantial denial in the conviction proceedings of defendant\u2019s rights under the Constitution of the United States\u201d, within the specification of R.R. 3:10A-2.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">Barry has failed to exhaust the post conviction remedy available to him in New Jersey<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and the Order of the District Court denying his petition for a writ of habeas corpus will be affirmed for that reason, and not on the grounds assigned by the District Court.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b643-8\">Separate opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"alf-dedup-0\">FREEDMAN, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b643-9\">I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that appellant failed to exhaust a state court remedy available to him in New Jersey under its post-conviction procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-10\">New Jersey Rule 3:10A-5 explicitly declares that a prior adjudication on the merits in any proceeding, including the proceedings resulting in the conviction, is a conclusive bar to any relief on that ground in post-conviction proceedings.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b643-13\">Appellant at his trial moved to suppress the seized evidence and attacked the validity of his arrest. His motion was denied, and when he sought interlocutory review in the appellate division of the Superior Court of New Jersey the court declined to hear the appeal. He then filed a motion for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of New Jersey, but the motion was denied \u201con the merits\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-14\">Appellant\u2019s present claim, as the majority opinion describes it, is that his federal constitutional rights were invaded when the New Jersey courts allowed the admission of evidence acquired by the police in an illegal search and seizure and thereby compelled him to plead guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-15\">It therefore seems clear to me that the basis of appellant\u2019s present attack by federal habeas corpus on his conviction in New Jersey is the same as that which he presented to the New Jersey courts and which they held inadequate on the merits. Such a decision constitutes a \u201cprior adjudication upon the merits\u201d, and under New Jersey Rule 3:10A-5 is \u201cconclusive\u201d in any post-conviction proceeding. I therefore believe that appellant should not be required to make a manifestly futile journey to the courts of New Jersey.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-16\">This leads to the question whether the district judge was correct in his view that the merits of the claim of an illegal search and seizure were irrelevant because appellant\u2019s plea of guilty, which he admitted was voluntarily made, constituted a waiver of any defenses which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>otherwise might have been available to him. Since the majority\u2019s view requires that the resolution of this question should be sought first from the state court, I express no opinion at this time on the merits.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b641-17\">.
