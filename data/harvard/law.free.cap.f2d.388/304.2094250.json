The Insurer-appellants concede that such contracts would be taxable under \u00a7 1804 of the Revenue Code of 1939, but they argue here that the reeodification in 1954 was more than that and actually brought about a material change of substance. The case turns finally on two little words, \u201ctaxable\u201d or \u201cdescribe,\u201d since the problem resolves itself into a question of whether in substituting \u201ctaxable\u201d for \u201cdescribe\u201d Congress meant to make a sudden and decisive change in underlying major legislative policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-16\">The intricacies of the statutes, their changes, and the legal argument based thereon are set forth in the District Court\u2019s opinion, American Bankers Insurance Company of Florida v. United States, S.D.Fla., 1967, 265 F.Supp. 67. The Court held the contracts were subject to the tax. We agree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-17\">The only relevant legislative history shows that Congress intended no substantial change in the provisions here in question. See S.Rep.No.1622, 83d Cong., 2d Sess., pp. 482-483 (3 U.S.C. Cong. &amp; Admin.News (1954), pp. 4621, 5127).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-18\">To accept the Insurer\u2019s argument would be to hold that only reinsurance policies issued by a foreign reinsurer to reinsure contracts issued by foreign insurers with respect to hazards, risks, losses or liabilities, wholly or partly within the United States are taxable under \u00a7 4371. Since such a holding would present problems of the reach of congressional taxing power, extraordinary problems of tax administration flowing from the necessity of policing insurance contracts issued and held abroad, and the withdrawal of long-continued legislative protection to American reinsurers <em>vis a vis </em>foreign reinsurers, we decline to follow literalism so literally to ascribe such an intent to Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-19\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
