(Gaines). A number of Gaines\u2019 creditors then filed an involuntary petition in bankruptcy on August 27, 1965. The record submitted to us is sketchy, but we glean from it that the property was sold by the United States on September 8, 1965 to satisfy the lien. Shortly thereafter, an amended petition in bankruptcy was filed, alleging that Gaines, while insolvent, had permitted the government to obtain this lien through \u201cdistraint\u201d and had not vacated or discharged it within 30 days from the date it was obtained or at least 5 days before the date set for the sale. The Referee adjudged Gaines a bankrupt, and the district court, Metzner, J., affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-24\">Gaines maintains that it did not commit an act of bankruptcy because it did not suffer or permit \u201cwhile <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>insolvent, any creditor to obtain a lien upon * * * [its] property through <em>legal proceedings or distraint * </em>* 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 21(a) (3) (emphasis added). Gaines argues that the government\u2019s tax liens arose by statute on the various dates when taxes were assesed, and not by \u201cdistraint\u201d under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6331 on August 20, 1965. But the fallacy in this argument is that the government did not merely obtain a tax assessment lien or a so-called \u201cfloating\u201d lien. Here, the government actually seized specific property \u2014and sold it too \u2014 in order to enforce the lien. This surely is a distraint within the meaning of the Act.

Our disposition makes it unnecessary for us to consider whether a $10.00 O.O.D. payment by Gaines constituted a preference.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
