[ABC] seeking a declaratory judgment that a television sponsoring agreement between Kemper and ABC constituted a tie-in which violated Section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1. The complaint, <em>inter alia, </em>sought treble damages in addition to a decree that the agreement was illegal and unenforceable. On May 31, 1967 \u2014 almost 2 years after the parties had moved for summary judgment \u2014 the District Court granted ABC\u2019s motion and denied Kemper\u2019s. This appeal followed from the judgment against Kemper. We believe that summary judgment, as intended to be utilized pursuant to Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, was inappropriately and imprudently employed in this case to resolve the important and exceedingly complex factual and legal dispute presented to the trial judge. We are of the view that the antitrust questions cannot be resolved for there remain material issues of fact that are not brought into sharp focus or clarified by the record before us. We therefore reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-20\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-21\">A substantial portion of the District Court\u2019s careful and elaborate opinion (reported at 270 F.Supp. 619) is devoted to a detailed presentation of the factual background of the dispute. While we shall make an effort to avoid repetition, the complexities of the litigation will be sketched in order to clarify the reasons for our belief that summary judgment was inappropriate in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-22\">ABC is one of 3 major television networks in the United States and during 1962-1963 approximately 260 television stations were affiliated with that network.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The greater part of network in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>come is derived from selling programs to sponsors (advertisers). All the networks arrange financial terms and details with their advertisers, such as providing network programs, technical facilities and scheduling programs for clearance. The programs and \u201ccommercials\u201d are ultimately broadcast to the public over the facilities of local stations which are licensed by the Federal Communications Commission [F.C.C.].<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The networks and local stations share the sponsor's payments on a percentage basis under the terms of an affiliation agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">In April 1961, ABC announced it would produce a nightly news program \u2014 the \u201cEvening Report\u201d \u2014 which it offered to its network stations on a 5-nights-per-week basis and by August, 95 stations had \u201ccleared\u201d (accepted) the program. These cleared stations are known in industry parlance as the \u201cgoing lineup.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Aki\">Under the typical affiliation agreement then employed by ABC, when a station cleared a program it was compelled to accept the sponsor provided by the network as well as those portions of the program for which the network could not find a sponsor. The local station did not receive any payment from ABC for broadcasting the unsponsored parts, but the apparent harshness of this arrangement was mitigated by the network\u2019s practice of \u201creleasing\u201d the unsold time to its affiliates for direct sale by them.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Another facet of these complex arrangements was that the local stations were required to \u201coption\u201d certain time periods and to accept programs (and sponsors) provided by ABC for those hours. \u201cEvening Report,\u201d however, was not broadcast during an option period and the local stations were therefore free to accept or reject the program as they saw fit.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-11\">From time to time, it was the practice of ABC to issue \u201coffering sheets\u201d concerning \u201cEvening Report.\u201d In essence, these are notices advising potential advertisers of the number of clearing stations, the prospective cost of the program, the names of other advertisers, if any, already sponsoring the program, and other relevant details. The gross price mentioned in the offering sheets was in large measure dependent on the hourly station rates of the individual local stations which had cleared the program. ABC published these rates in a so-called \u201crate card\u201d which was designed to reflect such factors as the number of homes with television sets reached by the particular station, the quality of its signal and the number of competing stations. In addition to the rate card time charge, the gross price contained in the offering sheet included a program charge and a \u201cnetworking\u201d charge. The offering sheet of April 27, 1961 is typical and its essential terms are set out in the margin.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We have been told that the offer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>ing sheet gross price was only a starting point for negotiations; a variety of \u201cspecial discounts\u201d were offered potential advertisers.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> And, the ultimate price charged was the product of detailed negotiations between advertiser and network.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In fact, Kemper alleges and ABC does not deny that \u201cEvening Report\u201d was not sold by ABC to a single sponsor at full rate card.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">The Kemper-ABC contract, dated August 15, 1962 (and resulting from extended negotiations), provided <em>inter alia, </em>that Kemper would sponsor \u201cEvening Report\u201d one evening per week for 26 weeks over 130 local television stations. But Kemper insists that it did not want to advertise over 32 of these stations and that it had agreed to take them only because ABC refused to make available the 95 stations it did want \u2014 except at an unreasonable cost \u2014 unless Kemper agreed to take the entire lineup.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> According to Kemper, a detailed analysis convinced it that it did not do a sufficient amount of business in the markets served by the 32 stations to justify advertising over them. Moreover, it claims that it did not seek business from these areas because it could not adequately service customers located there. ABC admits that Kemper sought to eliminate the 32 stations but contends that the lineup question was of minor importance in Kemper\u2019s advertising policies. It also states that Kemp-er ultimately took the entire package offered by ABC because it best served Kemper\u2019s needs. On its surface, it would appear that the contract does not reflect an illegal tie-in; it merely recites an agreement to sponsor a program over 130 different stations. But, we are urged not to overlook that ABC\u2019s alleged coercion is said to have taken place during the extensive period of negotiations which culminated in the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">Since the history of the negotiations is fully set forth in Judge Tenney\u2019s opinion, we will repeat only so much of it as will aid in comprehending our ultimate conclusion. It is not disputed that at a meeting in ABC\u2019s New York offices on January 25, 1962, Edgar Sherick, then ABC\u2019s vice president in charge of network sales, offered Buckingham W. Gunn, a senior official of Kemper\u2019s advertising agency, Clinton E. Frank, Inc. [Frank], the right to sponsor \u201cEvening Report\u201d at a package price of $22,000 per one quarter-hour segment for 2 segments per week over a 26 week period. The talks were preliminary, and detailed negotiations continued between officials of Kemper and the Frank agency and members of ABC\u2019s Chicago office. These talks culminated in a meeting that was held in the Chicago offices of the Frank agency on April 27, 1962 \u2014 by which time the going lineup consisted of approximately 99 stations. The subject matter under considerable discussion was that Kemper would order 39 segments of \u201cEvening Report\u201d over a 26 week period but would have the right to reduce its order to one segment per week if within 30 days of signing the contract not all the stations in Kemper\u2019s key markets cleared the program. The price was to be $22,000 per segment for 39 segments and $24,000 if only 26 segments were ordered. In addition, Kemper expressed an interest in 28 stations which had not yet cleared the program. ABC was willing to agree to furnish 15 of these stations at a maximum charge of $3,000 (assum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>ing all cleared) and the remaining 13 at \u201cno charge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">On or about May 4, 1962 Kemper submitted its first \u201corder letter\u201d for \u201cEvening Report\u201d in which it asked for 39 segments over a 26 week period. The lineup requested consisted of 95 stations \u201467 of the 99 already cleared as well as the 28 requested at the April 27th meeting. For this package Kemper offered a total price of $24,250 which its order letter broke down into a time charge which was not to exceed $18,750, a program charge of $5,000 and a $500 networking charge. The time charges were to be reduced by the \u201cpackage rate\u201d of any of the ordered stations that did not clear the program. Kemper conditioned its order on all the stations in its 41 \u201ckey markets\u201d clearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">According to ABC, Kemper\u2019s May 4th order improperly substituted the 28 stations it had requested at-the April 27th meeting for 32 of the stations that were part of the going lineup which ABC had offered. And, Kemper attempted to get these stations at the package rates discussed at the April 27th meeting even though the time charges for the 28 stations totaled more than twice those for the 32 stations. Accordingly, ABC rejected Kemper\u2019s order and on May 10, 1967 counter-offered Kemper the full 99 station lineup (which included the 67 stations ordered on May 4th) at a time charge of $15,750 and the 28 stations at a total cost of $3,000. With the program and network charges included, the cost was $24,250 \u2014 the same as in Kemper\u2019s May 4th order. Although it was thus offered extra stations at no extra cost, Kemper maintains that it wanted and preferred the package as it ordered it on May 4th. It alleges that ABC consistently refused to sell it the lineup it sought except at full rate card \u2014 that is, without the 47% per cent discount reflected in the April 27th discussions. ABC admits that it refused to sell Kem-per its limited lineup at the April 27th package rate although Kemper was asking for fewer stations at the same price; but, it responds (and Kemper denies) that it would be expensive to black out Kemper\u2019s commercials on the unwanted stations. Also, ABC tells us that it never insisted on Kemper paying full rate card for the smaller lineup but rather offered to negotiate further. In any event, Kem-per ultimately accepted the entire lineup of 130 stations and a contract was signed.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-12\">The life of the Kemper-ABC agreement (dated August 15, 1962) proved to be less than the period consumed by the negotiations already discussed. After only 4 of the 26 ordered broadcasts, Kem-per notified ABC that it considered its obligations under the contract at an end. It declared that on November 11, 1962, ABC had broadcast a program titled \u201cThe Political Obituary of Richard M. Nixon\u201d during which Alger Hiss was permitted to evaluate Mr. Nixon\u2019s role in the Hiss perjury case. The program was promoted on broadcast time sponsored and paid for by Kemper and in substance it contended that ABC violated the contract by associating Kemper with a program that was in poor taste. Two days later Kemper advised ABC that it was cancelling its sponsorship. Efforts at reconciliation proved fruitless and on January 9, 1963 ABC filed suit in the New York Supreme Court for breach of contract. A final judgment was ultimately entered for $265,047.21. 48 Misc.2d 397, 265 N.Y.S.2d 76, aff\u2019d, 24 App.Div.2d 851, 265 N.Y.S.2d 577 (1st Dept. 1965), aff\u2019d, 17 N.Y.2d 849, 271 N.Y.S.2d 284, 218 N.E.2d 324 (1966). Kemper asserted for the first time its claim that the agreement with ABC violated the Sherman Act in its answer in the state court suit and in the complaint it filed in federal court.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b326-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>On May 31, 1963, ABC moved in the federal court to dismiss Kemper\u2019s complaint on the ground that it failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. Judge Cooper denied this motion, 221 F.Supp. 848 (S.D.N.Y.1963), noted, 39 Notre Dame Law. 719 (1964), holding that the allegation that ABC refused to make available a limited lineup of 95 stations except at a disproportionately high price stated a cause of action under the Sherman Act. The case was then assigned to Judge Tenney as a Rule 2 Judge (Rule 2, General Rules for the Southern and Eastern Districts of New York) and the motions for summary judgment were then argued 'to him. After examining voluminous affidavits, exhibits and depositions, he granted ABC\u2019s motion for summary judgment in a painstaking opinion which consumes almost 70 pages in the appendix on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">Judge Tenney advanced 4 grounds for his decision. First, he ruled that ABC sold Kemper a single \u201cproduct\u201d- \u2014 the privilege of being identified as the sponsor of \u201cEvening Report.\u201d Since only a single product had been sold, a tie-in could not have occurred. Second, assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the transaction was properly characterized as the sale of different television stations, for purposes of tie-in analysis the different stations were components of a single product because it was \u201ca reasonable and economically justified requirement of the industry\u201d to sell them all as one package. Third, assuming <em>arguendo </em>that more than one product was involved in the sale, ABC was legally justified in rejecting Kemper\u2019s May 4th order , and reverting to its higher rate card prices \u201ceven though said prices are substantially higher than the average price per unit for all the components of the package.\u201d Finally, he ruled that Kemper was not coerced by ABC because it never attempted to negotiate a lower price after ABC rejected its May 4th order. Ai-though we understand the reasons which would motivate a district judge in seeking to avoid a complex and grating trial, we believe that material questions of fact were presented with respect to each of these alternative grounds for decision and that summary judgment was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">The importance of summary judgment in the structure of modern federal practice as a procedural weapon to pierce sham claims and resolve actions where the facts are undisputed has been frequently noted by this court. See, e. g., Dressler v. MV Sandpiper, 331 F.2d 130 (2d Cir. 1964). Although some of the older decisions of this court had put in question the wisdom of granting summary judgment, we interpreted the 1963 amendments to Rule 56 as suggesting that the courts thereafter were to approach the Rule with less reticence and more resoluteness. Dressier v. MV Sandpiper, supra (discussing cases); 6 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice \u00b6 56.15 [1], 1966 supp. at 102.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-10\">The functions and purposes of summary judgment have been stated thus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-11\">\u201cIt is intended to prevent vexation and delay, improve the machinery of justice, promote the expeditious disposition of cases, and avoid unnecessary trials where no genuine issues of fact are raised. The procedure enables a party to pierce the allegations of fact in the pleadings and obtain relief by\u2018 showing that there are no issues to be tried. Its purpose is to separate the formal from the substantial issues, eliminate improper issues, determine what, if any, issues of fact are present for the jury to determine, and enable the court to give judgment on the issues of law where no disputed issues of fact are found.\u201d 3 Barron <em>&amp; </em>Holt-zoff, Federal Practice and Procedure, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>\u00a7 1231, at 97-100 (Wright ed. 1958) (footnotes omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">But it is a fundamental maxim that on a motion for summary judgment the court cannot try issues of fact; it can only determine whether there are issues to be tried. And, \u201c[o]n summary judgment the inferences to be drawn from the underlying facts contained in such materials [affidavits, exhibits and depositions] must be viewed in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion.\u201d United States v. Diebold, 369 U. S. 654, 655, 82 S.Ct. 993, 994, 8 L.Ed.2d 176 (1962) (per curiam).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Thus, the standard to be applied on a motion for summary judgment is analogous to that used on a motion for a directed verdict. Empire Electronics Co. v. United States, 311 F.2d 175, 180 (2d Cir. 1962). See 6 Moore, supra, \u00b6[ 56.02 [10]; 3 Barron &amp; Holtzoff, supra, \u00a7 1234, at 133. Of course, the law provides no magical talisman or compass that will serve as an unerring guide to determine when a material issue of fact is presented. As is so often true in the law, this is a matter of informed and properly reasoned judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">The instant litigation is somewhat atypical because both parties clam- or for summary judgment urging that the record presents no disputed material issue of fact \u2014 as if a trial is to be avoided like the plague. But, rather typical of such \u201cagreements\u201d to end the case by summary judgment, this admirable harmony does not carry over to agreement on what the \u201cundisputed\u201d facts are or the permissible inferences to be drawn from them. While a substantial part (but not all) of the evidence is documentary, the parties sharply dispute the inferences to be drawn, see United States v. Diebold, Empire Electronics v. United States, supra, and, as we shall see below, the depositions present conflicting testimony. In any event, \u201c[t]he well settled rule is that cross-motions for summary judgment do not warrant the court in granting summary judgment unless one of the moving parties is entitled to judgment as a matter of law upon facts that are not genuinely disputed.\u201d 6 Moore, supra, [\u00b6] 56.13, at 2247. See also Barron &amp; Holtzoff, supra, \u00a7 1239, at 176. Nor, have we lost sight of the fact that neither ABC nor Kemper requested a jury trial and that ultimately the unresolved questions will be decided by the District Judge. But the function of an appellate court is not to determine whether there is sufficient evidence in the record to substantiate \u201cfindings\u201d of fact that were never made. Compare Bollenbach v. United States, 326 U.S. 607, 614, 66 S.Ct. 402, 90 L.Ed. 350 (1946). On the contrary, the District Court must at a trial resolve contested factual issues and draw the appropriate inferences in the first instance with full recognition that the issues are disputed, and only after sufficient evidence has been introduced to permit an informed judgment. As we said in Empire Electronics Co. v. United States, supra, 311 F.2d at 180-181: \u201cIf reasonable inferences could be drawn * * * such that the issue would be submitted to the trier of fact, then Rule 56(c) leaves us no latitude and <em>we must return that issue to the trier of fact in this case the judge.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.) See 6 Moore, supra, [\u00b6] 56.15 [1-02], at 2291-92; Asbill &amp; Snell, \u201cSummary Judgment Under the Federal Rules \u2014 When an Issue of Fact is Presented,\u201d 51 Mich.L.Rev. 1143, 1146 n. 15 (1953). Cf. Colby v. Klune, 178 F.2d 872, 874 (2d Cir. 1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-9\">Moreover, we have been forewarned that the use of summary judgment in complex antitrust litigation must be closely scrutinized. Poller v. Colum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>bia Broadcasting System, 368 U.S. 464, 473, 82 S.Ct. 486, 7 L.Ed.2d 458 (1962). And, this admonition is apt where too little is known of the practical impact of the challenged transactions, White Motor Co. v. United States, 372 U.S. 253, 263-264, 83 S.Ct. 696, 9 L.Ed.2d 738 (1963). But, this is not to say that summary judgment never has a place in the antitrust field. See White Motor Co. v. United States, supra, 372 U.S. at 259, 83 S.Ct. 696; 6 Moore, supra, \u00b6[ 56.17 [5]; 3 Barron &amp; Holtzoff, supra, \u00a7 1232 (1967 supp.).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">The question before us is not the availability of the rule in any specific category of cases, but whether the record in this particular case adequately clarifies the complex and convoluted issues that are so common in antitrust litigation. Thus, our holding here does not weaken the force of Rule 56, but \u201csimply recognize [s] that there are instances where summary judgment is too blunt a weapon with which to win the day, particularly where so many complicated issues of fact must be resolved in order to deal adequately with difficult questions of law which remain in the case.\u201d Miller v. General Outdoor Advertising Co., 337 F.2d 944, 948 (2d Cir. 1964). Cf. Allied Mutual Insurance Co. v. Lysne, 324 F.2d 290 (8th Cir. 1963); S. J. Groves &amp; Sons Co. v. Ohio Turnpike Commission, 315 F.2d 235 (6th Cir. 1963). In the context of this case, Judge Weinfeld stated the precept well:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-5\">\u201cI am persuaded that a decision after trial will be the more desirable procedure in the matter. It will serve to bring into sharper focus certain issues of importance which have been obscured by the voluminous affidavits with their statements, counterstate-ments and alternative positions, and the conflicting conclusions which the parties contend are to be drawn from the multitude of facts and statistics presented.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-6\">Under all the circumstances the application of the summary judgment rule is questionable and the Court deems it sound judicial administration to permit a trial for such additional evidence and clarification as may be relevant.\u201d United States v. Bethlehem Steel Corp., 157 F.Supp. 877, 879 (S.D.N.Y.1958) (Bethlehem was ultimately tried to the court, 168 F.Supp. 576).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">See also Kennedy v. Silas Mason Co., 334 U.S. 249, 256-257, 68 S.Ct. 1031, 92 L.Ed. 1347 (1948); H. J. Heinz Co. v. Beech-Nut Life Savers, Inc., 181 F.Supp. 452 (S.D.N.Y.1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-9\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-10\">With these principles in mind, we turn to the grounds for decision advanced by the District Court. Judge Tenney reasoned that ABC had not tied the sale of the 95 stations Kemper wanted to the sale of 32 stations it did not want because, conceptually, only a single \u201cproduct\u201d was involved in the transaction. Indeed, it is axiomatic that a tie-in analysis begins with the question of separability \u2014 the requirement that the tying and tied products be different, or, stated simply, that the forced purchase be of a second distinct commodity. As Professor Turner (now Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Anti-Trust Division) stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-11\">\u201cThe requirement that they [the tying and tied products] be \u2018different\u2019 obviously cannot be dropped out. Every manufactured item is a combination of various materials and components. There are obvious cases in which we would say either that there is no tie-in because the object of the sale is a single product, or that if there is a tie-in, it should not be deemed illegal per se or even illegal at all.\u201d Turner, The Validity of Tying Arrangements Under the Antitrust Laws, 72 Harv.L. Rev. 50, 67-68 (1958).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b328-12\">See Times-Picayune Publishing Co. v. United States, 345 U.S. 594, 614, 73 S.Ct. 872, 97 L.Ed. 1277 (1953); Susser v. Carvel Corp., 332 F.2d 505, 512 (2d Cir. 1964), cert, dismissed, 381 U.S. 125, 85 S.Ct. 1364, 14 L.Ed.2d 284 (1965); Pearson, Tying Arrangements and Anti-trust Policy, 60 Nw.U.L.Rev. 626, 627 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number><em>Times-Picayune, </em>supra, has been cited to us as a case where the Court was presented with a question for determination not too dissimilar from the one before us. The government contended that the defendant had unlawfully tied the sale of advertisements in its morning newspaper to the sale of advertisements in an afternoon paper it also published. The Court stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-4\">\u201ctwo newspapers under single ownership at the same place, time, and terms sell indistinguishable products to advertisers; no dominant \u2018tying\u2019 product exists (in fact, since space in neither the Times-Picayune nor the States [the two papers] can be bought alone, one may be viewed as \u2018tying\u2019 as the other); no leverage in one market excludes sellers in the second, because for present purposes the products are identical and the market the same.\u201d 345 U.S. at 614, 73 S.Ct. at 883.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">But the issue of separability here is not quite the same as in <em>Times-Picayune; </em>it is manifest that whether one or more products is involved in a given transaction must be dependent upon the nature of that transaction. One factor that may distinguish this case from <em>Times-Picayune, </em>for example, is that commercials over different local television stations reach what are clearly different markets.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Moreover, as Judge Tenney recognized, the influence of the Court\u2019s analysis of the tying issue in <em>Times-Picayune </em>has been relatively restricted in later cases. See, e. g., Associated Press v. Taft-Ingalls Corp., 340 F.2d 753, 760-761 (6th Cir.), cert, denied, 382 U. S. 820, 86 S.Ct. 47, 15 L.Ed.2d 66 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-9\">The District Judge, in determining that a single product was involved in the Kemper-ABC transaction, placed major reliance on Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. v. Amana Refrigeration, Inc., 295 F.2d 375 (7th Cir. 1961) cert, denied, 369 U.S. 812, 82 S.Ct. 689, 7 L.Ed.2d 612 (1962).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In <em>Amana, </em>CBS sued to recover monies due under a television sponsorship agreement and Amana counterclaimed that CBS\u2019s rate structure violated sections of the Clayton Act, 15 U. S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 13(a), 14 and 15. The court held that \u201ca purchase by Amana of the privilege of having itself identified as sponsor of the program broadcast and making use of the permissible portion thereof for advertising its products\u201d was not the purchase of a \u201ccommodity\u201d within the meaning of the Act. Id. at 378.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Whether or not <em>Amana </em>correctly characterizes the nature of the sale in this case, a point we do not decide, we see nothing in the rationale of that opinion which compels a holding that in analyzing the tying issue \u201cthe privilege of having itself identified as sponsor of the program\u201d should not or may not be considered a different \u201cproduct\u201d for each station sold. We have already noted that each local station is licensed independently by the F.C.C. and serves different markets. To absolutely preclude applicability of the Sherman Act \u2014 a broad remedial statute \u2014 merely by characterizing a transaction by some <em>ipse dixit </em>formulation would be to frustrate the Congressional intent in a most mechanical fashion. In any event, this is merely to recognize the problem, not to solve it; there may yet be ample justification for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>treating a sale of advertising time over different stations as a single \u201cproduct\u201d for purposes of the antitrust laws. Compare Dehydrating Process Co. v. A. O. Smith Corp., 292 F.2d 653, 655 (1st Cir.), cert, denied, 368 U.S. 931, 82 S.Ct. 368, 7 L.Ed.2d 194 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">Recognizing these considerations, Judge Tenney held that it \u201cis a reasonable and economically justified requirement of the industry\u201d to sell many-station lineups as a single package.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The trial judge applied the four criteria of separability laid down in United States v. Jerrold Electronics Corp., 187 F.Supp. 545, 559 (E.D.Pa.1960), aff\u2019d per curiam, 365 U.S. 567, 81 S.Ct. 755, 5 L.Ed.2d 806 (1961), and for present purposes we accept his summary of <em>Jerrold. </em>The first test is: \u201cDid competitors of the seller offer all the components of the alleged \u2018product\u2019 separately and not exclusively as a single package?\u201d Kemper alleges, and ABC does not deny, that when it advertised over the NBC network it was allowed to select its own lineup. And, there is some indication in the record that this practice was not uncommon in the industry. The second test is: \u201cWas the number of components of the product variable \u2018so that hardly any two versions of the alleged product were the same?\u201d\u2019 It is not disputed that ABC <em>offered </em>a going lineup to all prospective purchasers. But an uncontroverted affidavit submitted by Kemper alleges that on a number of occasions ABC sold \u201cEvening Report\u201d on a selective partial lineup basis.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Moreover, ABC admits that it was willing to sell Kemper the lineup it desired; ABC merely demanded that Kemper pay more. Third, \u201cWas the purchaser charged for each component and not a lump sum for the total product?\u201d It is undisputed that ABC\u2019s offering sheets set a total price per broadcast but it is also true that ABC published a rate card time charge for each individual station. Finally, \u201cDid the seller offer similar components for sale separately?\u201d As noted above, there was evidence suggesting that ABC did this on occasion.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">Thus, applying the criteria suggested by <em>Jerrold </em>to the case before us, and drawing all inferences in favor of Kemp-er as we are required to do, United States v. Diebold, supra, we are unable to determine on the record before us whether the Kemper-ABC transaction concerned a single product for purposes of a tie-in analysis.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The evidence submitted on this motion for summary judgment was simply insufficient to make a determination that the practices just described were typical or economically necessary in the television industry. ABC urges that it is in the public interest for it to build a \u201cstrong network.\u201d But it is not at all clear from the facts what added burden would have been imposed upon ABC had Kemper sponsored the program over only some of the stations which had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>cleared it for broadcast.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> For example, would the network or local stations have incurred substantial costs by blacking out the undesired stations? Was there a ready national market where ABC could have sold the remaining stations? Would local stations refuse to clear the program if they knew that they might not be sponsored by particular advertisers ? On the record presented, we find it impossible to answer these and similar relevant questions. In order that our decision not be misconstrued, it should be emphasized that we do not now hold that more than one \u201cproduct\u201d is involved in the sale of commercial time over many stations; we merely hold that additional evidence and clarification is required.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">Finally, the District Court decided that Kemper failed to demonstrate that ABC had employed an illegal tie-in (assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that more than one \u201cproduct\u201d was involved) because \u201cthe necessary element of coercion, economic or otherwise, has not been proven.\u201d See Osborn v. Sinclair Refining Co., 286 F.2d 832, 836 (4th Cir. 1960), cert, denied, 366 U.S. 963, 81 S.Ct. 1924, 6 L.Ed.2d 1255 (1961). Two independent reasons were given: (a) ABC was legally justified in rejecting Kemper\u2019s May 4th letter order and reverting to its rate card time charges for Kemper\u2019s selected lineup; and (b) Kemper never attempted to negotiate a discount price after ABC rejected its May 4th order. This argument, we assume, is based on the premise that if Kemper never attempted to open the door, it cannot claim it was slammed in its face.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">Here too, we find it impossible on the record before us to determine whether ABC was justified in reverting to its higher rate card prices. As we view the law, where there is no quality or distinguishing desideratum between a product offered singly or in a package, the seller cannot charge substantially higher for the individual product if the price differential has the effect of conditioning the sale of the single product to the sale of the entire package and if the difference in price cannot be legitimately justified by cost considerations.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-9\">The leading case in this area is United States v. Loew\u2019s Inc., 371 U.S. 38, 83 S.Ct. 97, 9 L.Ed.2d 11 (1962), in which the government challenged the \u201cblock booking\u201d of feature motion picture films for sale to television exhibitors. The lower court decree had enjoined the defendants from:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-10\">\u201c(C) Entering into any agreement to sell or license the right to exhibit any feature film over any television station in which the differential between the price or fee for such feature film when sold or licensed alone and the price or fee for the same film when sold or licensed with one or more other film [sic] has the effect of conditioning the sale or license of such film upon the sale or license of one or more other films.\u201d Id. at 43, 83 S.Ct. at 101.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A_L\">The government contended that this provision was too vague for effective enforcement and the court responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-11\">\u201cThe final judgments as entered only prohibit a price differential between a film offered individually and as part of a package which \u2018has the effect of conditioning the sale or license of such film upon the sale or license of one or more other films.\u2019 * * * Differentials unjustified by cost savings may already be prohibited under the decree as it now appears. Nevertheless, the addition of a specific provision to prevent such differentials will prevent uncertainty in the operation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>of the decree * * * to ensure that all proper bases of quantity discount may be used, the modification [of the decree] should be worded in terms of allowing all legitimate cost justifications.\u201d Id. at 54-55, 83 S.Ct. at 107.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">We do not read this to mean, of course, that a purchaser can select the most expensive individual item from a package and demand it at the average price for all the items in the package\u2014 a price which necessarily reflects the charges for the less, costly components of the package. But Kemper was not selecting a limited number of stations and demanding them at the average package price; it insists it was willing to pay for its limited 95 station lineup what ABC was demanding for all 130 stations. The trial judge seemed more certain than we are that in its May 4th order Kemper substituted the 28 more expensive for the 32 cheaper stations.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> In any event, regardless of how Kemper arrived at the figures it used in its May 4th order, we are still faced with Kemper\u2019s claim that it was requesting fewer stations than ABC was offering at the price ABC was demanding. And, under the circumstances of this case, we do not think it is an answer to say that the rate card prices to which ABC reverted were pre-established. Apparently, full rate card prices were never charged by ABC. Moreover, to hold that a seller can avoid the impact of the <em>Loew\u2019s </em>rationale merely by setting a pre-established price for each individual item \u2014 even if that price is rarely if ever charged and is, in relation to the package price, fanciful and unjustified by cost \u2014 would mean that the antitrust laws could be flouted at will.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">On the incomplete record before us, we find it impossible to determine whether there were justified cost differentials between ABC\u2019s individual and package prices. The extent of the extra administrative burden, if any, that ABC would incur, if it had to negotiate on a less than full lineup basis is unclear. And, Kemp-er maintains steadfastly that ABC would incur no cost by having to black out the unwanted stations. While there are suggestions in the record that would seem to lend some support to this contention, it is possible that although blacking out involves no cost to the <em>network, </em>it would impose a substantial burden on the individual stations \u2014 a burden which might ultimately have to be borne by the network. In any event, additional evidence is needed before a determination can be made that ABC\u2019s pricing differentials were justified by costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-9\">As we have already noted, the District Judge found that Kemper never attempted to negotiate with ABC after it rejected its May 4th letter order. Judge Tenney seems to suggest that Kemper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>had a duty to approach the hierarchy of officialdom at ABC\u2019s New York office with respect to a discount on its selected lineup, and should not have been content to accept the rejection it received from the lower echelon in the network\u2019s Chicago sales office. But the law does not demand that Kemper joust with windmills; it would have been reasonable to require it to negotiate only if there was a chance of success. If all the inferences are resolved in favor of Kemper\u2014 as we are required to do on ABC\u2019s motion for summary judgment, United States v. Diebold, supra \u2014 we believe that on the record before us it is a disputed issue of fact whether, under all the circumstances of this case, it was reasonable to have required Kemper to attempt to negotiate further after ABC rejected its order.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">Kemper has insisted in these summary proceedings that ABC adamantly refused to sell the desired lineup at other than rate card. And, an ABC official asserted that he had been told by his superior that \u201cif they [Kemper] insist on a specific lineup, they must pay rate card.\u201d Of course, if this ABC policy was never communicated to Kemper, it could not have been a factor in the decision not to negotiate; but, this is not clear. It is also true that there was some evidence that at a meeting held on May 18th, Kemper was told that \u201cwe [ABC] would be willing to renegotiate the deal.\u201d However, the record also discloses that at another point in the meeting Kemper was told that the selected lineup would cost \u201crate card and then some.\u201d Moreover, an official of the Frank agency stated that after the May 18th meeting he was informed that \u201cABC New York\u201d wanted Kemper to take the full lineup and the price seemingly was to be rate card. Following all these meetings and conversations, Kemper alleges that it concluded that any further efforts to get ABC to modify its position would be doomed to failure. Consequently, it capitulated and agreed to ABC\u2019s terms.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> It is apparent to us that the facts underlying the negotiations are in serious conflict and thus it is impossible to resolve them on this motion or to draw inferences adverse to Kemper, as would be necessary for a holding that Kemper\u2019s refusal to negotiate was unreasonable.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-9\">In sum, we are of the opinion that this case was not ripe for summary judgment. While this matter has already been pending for an inordinate amount of time, we cannot grant or withhold summary judgment merely because it would save time or expense. Cf. 3 Barron &amp; Holtzoff, supra, \u00a7 1231 (1967 supp.). We suggest in the interest of judicial economy, however, that the District Court first determine at trial whether it was reasonable for Kemper not to have attempted to negotiate further. A negative answer based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>on adequate evidence and findings would obviate the need for further proceedings with respect to the issues discussed in part IV of this opinion.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">Summary judgment in favor of ABC is reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b322-15\">.

Evening and afternoon viewers of television, for example, constitute a substantially different market, as do viewers in New York and Dubuque.

Similarly, we voice no opinion on the rule of law that would apply if a sponsor demanded a lineup of two or three stations.

We will cross that bridge when we come to it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b332-5\">. As we understand the parties\u2019 contentions, there are two different equations submitted for arriving at the figures in Kemper\u2019s May 4th order. Kemper claims it was willing to pay for 67 of 99 stations the $15,750 ABC was asking for the full lineup of 99. It asserts that it added to this figure the $3,000 charge for the 28 additional stations it wanted, to arrive at the $18,750 station time charge found in its May 4th order. ABC claims that Kemper treated all 99 stations as fungible and deducted a proportional amount ($2,871.23) for the 32 unwanted stations from the time charge used at the April 27th meeting. It then added $5,-588.88 \u2014 the discounted rate for the 28 stations it wanted \u2014 to arrive at a figure of $18,467.65, which was rounded to $18,-750 in the May 4th letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">It is apparent that either theory would account for the figure Kemper used. While it is relatively clear that Kemper, in an intra-office memo sometime previous to the April 27th meeting, employed the method of computation suggested by ABC, an official of the Frank agency swore in an affidavit submitted on the motion that these earlier computations were not reflected in Kemper\u2019s orders. We have already indicated in part II that on a motion for summary judgment, with no opportunity to evaluate the demeanor of the witnesses, it is not the function of the court to determine whether the affiant is telling the truth or that he seems \u201cpersuasive.\u201d We note in this connection that it is not obvious to us why Kemper should have used a figure of $5,588.88 for the 28 extra stations when ABC had previously stated at the April 27th meeting that it would agree to charge only $3,000.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b333-5\">. The District Court placed great emphasis on a number of Kemper memoran-da that did not indicate the lineup problem was of importance to the company. The significance of many of these documents without further evidence must be discounted, however, since they were written after Kemper alleges it capitulated to ABC\u2019s demands.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b333-6\">. We frankly find the positions advanced by both parties in this summary proceeding somewhat puzzling and incongruous. Kemper claims it refused extra stations although they would cost nothing additional because it could not adequately service potential customers. ABC, on the other hand, apparently insisted that Kemper take something for nothing, allegedly because it would be expensive to cut out the unwanted stations. But when Kemper ordered its limited lineup, ABO did not respond \u201cyou can have your lineup at the package rate but you will, of course, have to pay any expenses we will incur by cutting out stations.\u201d Instead, it spoke of \u201crate card and then some\u201d\u2014 to an important customer \u2014 although it apparently never charged anyone rate card. The only fact of possible monetary significance that we can detect between Kemper\u2019s offer and ABC\u2019s counteroffer is that Kemper stipulated that the charge \u201cshall be reduced by the package rate of any station not clearing.\u201d But the maximum price effect appears to be relatively insignificant and it does not rationalize for us the positions of the parties.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"AY4\">. Another issue, not raised by ABC, which could well be explored before confronting the important and difficult problem of application of the \u201ctie-in\u201d principle to network broadcasting, is the possible bearing of Kelly v. Kosuga, 358 U.S. 516, 79 S.Ct. 429, 3 L.Ed.2d 475 (1959). The principal, indeed almost the sole, item of damage which plaintiffs seek to recover is the state court judgment for their breach of contract committed for a reason wholly unrelated to the antitrust laws; if, under <em>Kelly, </em>the antitrust laws did not give Kemper a valid antitrust defense to that suit, they can hardly permit it to recover three times the amount of the judgment. The case arguably differs from <em>Kelly </em>in that here the contract included the sale of something alleged to constitute an illegal tie-in; however, it is also unlike Associated Press v. Taft-Ingalls Corp., 341 F.2d 753 (6th Cir.), cert, denied, 382 U.S. 820, 86 S.Ct. 47, 15 L.Ed.2d 66 (1965) in that, although the record is not completely clear on this point, the price for the entire package of 130 stations appears to have been no greater than Kemper was willing to pay for the 95 stations they wanted. We note also that the discussion in <em>Kelly </em>assumed that there was a \u201clawful sale <em>for a fair consideration,\u201d </em>358 U.S. at 521, 79 S.Ct. at 432 (emphasis supplied), a fact upon which the District Court made no findings.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
