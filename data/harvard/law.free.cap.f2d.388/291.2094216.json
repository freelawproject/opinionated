That injury was, in the words of appellant\u2019s counsel, \u201ca psycho-physiological-musculo-skeletal reaction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b340-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>During the compensable period for workmen\u2019s compensation, the appellee company employed private detectives to obtain certain information about the appellant, allegedly for use in a further proceeding in the workmen\u2019s compensation case. An altercation occurred between appellant and one of the detectives. This action for personal injuries was instituted following the altercation. It was alleged in the complaint that the company \u201cknew of plaintiff\u2019s neurotic condition and it was expressly designed as a part of its program of harassment of the plaintiff to provoke the plaintiff to displaying his neurotic tendencies;\u201d also that \u201cas a direct and proximate result of the misconduct of the defendant, its attorneys, agents and employees the previously existing traumatic neurosis was deepened, extended, and aggravated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">Before the personal injury case came to trial, additional proceedings were had in the workmen\u2019s compensation case. In those proceedings counsel for appellant stated in writing that the issue was: \u201cIs plaintiff\u2019s present disability due to the injury of December 3, 1958?\u201d Having stated the question, appellant\u2019s counsel then said, \u201cThe answer should be yes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">Judge Talbot Smith, United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, granted summary judgment for the appellee on the ground that appellant\u2019s position in the personal injury case is so clearly inconsistent with his position before the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Commission that the principle of judicial estoppel applies, citing Scarano v. Central R. Co. of New Jersey, 203 F.2d 510 (3rd Cir. 1953), and cases of like import. We agree. Appellant having taken the unequivocal position in the workmen\u2019s compensation proceeding that his present disability is due solely to the 1958 injury, he will not be permitted to assert in this action that his disability is a result of subsequent tortious conduct by the appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">For the reasons set forth in Judge Smith\u2019s opinion, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
