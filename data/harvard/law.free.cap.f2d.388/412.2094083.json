Appellants suffered losses in excess of four million dollars in the aggregate as a result of their having placed deposits in the now defunct San Francisco National Bank. Defendants in the California lawsuits are insurance companies which, it is alleged, are liable for this loss under the terms of insurance policies issued by them to the appellants. The policies are of a standard form, conmmonly called \u201csavings and loan blanket bonds\u201d or \u201cForm 22 bonds.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b461-15\">In one of the cases to which this matter is auxiliary, Union Federal Savings and Loan Ass\u2019n of Pittsfield, Massachusetts v. Transamerica Ins. Co., Civil No. 44549, the defendant moved for summary judgment on the ground that a \u201cdeposit\u201d is a \u201cloan\u201d as the word \u201cloan\u201d is used in an exclusion clause of the Form 22 bond. In denying the motion, the District Judge indicated that the term \u201cloan\u201d may be latently ambiguous and that there was presented a genuine issue of material fact relating to the intent of the parties and the circumstances surrounding the execution of the contracts. In response to this ruling, appellants served interrogatories upon the defendants relating to the meaning of the terms and provisions of the Form 22 bond. One defendant, Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity Company, stated in answer to these interrogatories that appellee, the Surety Association of America, a trade association of insurance companies located in New York, was best qualified to answer these interrogatories. It is the Surety Association that formulates standardized insurance policies and provides interpretations of these policies. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>Subsequently, appellants noticed the deposition of John F. Fitzgerald, Secretary of the Surety Association, to be taken in New York City and Mr. Fitzgerald was served with a subpoena <em>duces tecum, </em>returnable on December 19, 1966. The subpoena called for the production of files, records, correspondence and documents relating to the adoption of thirteen different standardized bonds including Form 22, for other information relating to interpretations of those bonds, and for communications between the Surety Association and several of the defendants in the California litigation. The deposition was later rescheduled and the subpoena <em>duces tecum </em>made returnable on January 23, 1967.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">At his deposition, Fitzgerald produced only the documents marked Exhibits 1\u2014 14A of this appeal. These documents included information relating to the Form 22 bond and correspondence between the Surety Association and the United States Savings &amp; Loan League (a trade association of savings and loan associations) concerning interpretations of the Form 22 bond. Fitzgerald refused to produce the other documents requested, including communications between the Surety Association and the defendants in the California litigation and minutes of meetings at which formulation of the clauses of the Form 22 bond was discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">Because of Fitzgerald\u2019s refusal to produce the subpoenaed documents, appellants moved for an order directing the production of the documents described in the subpoena <em>duces tecum </em>and requiring the Surety Association to pay the reasonable expenses incurred in obtaining such order. Appellee cross-moved to quash or modify the subpoena on the dual grounds of privilege and lack of relevancy. Judge Ryan did not rule on the question of privilege, but held that the documents, other than those already produced, were not relevant. He, therefore, granted ap-pellee\u2019s motion to limit the subpoena to those documents already produced and denied appellant\u2019s requested order.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">The appealability of this type order was recently sustained in Republic Gear Co. v. Borg-Warner Corp., 381 F.2d 551 (2d Cir. 1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">At the outset we dismiss appellee\u2019s claim that the information requested in the subpoena is subject to an \u201cexecutive\u201d or \u201cgovernmental\u201d privilege. Appellee\u2019s self-characterization as a \u201cgovernmental agency\u201d is based on the rather tenuous assertion that the Surety Association \u201cfunctions as an arm or alter ego of the [New York] Superintendent of Insurance\u2019.\u2019 (appellee\u2019s brief, p. 21). But if every organization which is somewhat controlled or constrained by state or federal regulations were to claim to be a governmental agency, it is difficult to suggest who would not qualify for such a status. Even within the government itself, the privilege is severely limited. United States v. Reynolds, 345 U.S. 1, 7-8, 73 S.Ct. 528, 97 L.Ed. 727 (1953). There is no authority for extending the privilege as requested here.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">The only restriction placed upon the matters which may be gone into upon discovery examinations is that they be relevant. Rule 26(b), Fed.R.Civ.Pro. Relevancy, in this context, is tested by a rather liberal standard. \u201cThus it is relevancy to the subject matter which is the test and subject matter is broader than the precise issues presented by the pleadings.\u201d Kaiser-Frazer Corp. v. Otis &amp; Co., 11 F.R.D. 50, 53 (S.D.N.Y.1951). But, \u201cpractical considerations dictate that the parties should not be permitted to roam in shadow zones of relevancy and to explore matter which does not presently appear germane on the theory that it might conceivably become so.\u201d Broadway &amp; Ninety-Sixth St. Realty Co. v. Loew\u2019s Inc., 21 F.R.D. 347, 352 (S.D.N.Y. 1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-9\">On the question of relevancy, however, the trial judge has considerable discretion and his order should not be disturbed unless there has been an abuse of discretion or when the action taken \u201cwas improvident and affected the substantial rights of the parties.\u201d Carter v. Baltimore &amp; O. R. Co., 80 U.S.App. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>D.C. 257, 152 F.2d 129, 131 (1945). See also Waterman, An Appellate Judge\u2019s Approach When Reviewing District Court Sanctions Imposed for the Purpose of Insuring Compliance with Pretrial Orders, 29 F.E.D. 420 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">Appellants argue that the district court, acting as an <em>auxiliary </em>court, abused its discretion by even considering the question of relevancy when the <em>primary </em>court had ordered the production of the documents. As was noted in Dowagiac Mfg. Co. v. Lochren, 143 F. 211, 215 (8th Cir. 1906):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-6\">\u201c * * * it js not the duty of an auxiliary court or judge, within whose jurisdiction testimony is being taken in a suit pending in the court of another district, to consider or determine the competency, materiality, or relevancy of the evidence which one of the parties seeks to elicit. It is the duty of such a court or judge to compel the production of the evidence, although the judge deems it incompetent or immaterial, unless the witness or the evidence is privileged, or it clearly and affirmatively appears that the evidence cannot possibly be competent, material, or relevant, and that it would be an abuse of the process of the court to compel its production.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">See Perkins v. Endicott Johnson Corp., 128 F.2d 208, 214 (2d Cir. 1942). The difficulty with this rule is that it may subject a non-party witness outside the jurisdiction of the primary court to possibly greater hardship than if he were within the primary court\u2019s jurisdiction. In the instant case, appellants would be able to use the facilities of the district court in New York to enforce their subpoena, but would require the witness, if he has a valid objection pertaining to relevancy, to go all the way to California to seek relief. In such a case, a district court acting as an auxiliary court is not powerless to prevent an abuse of the discovery process. Judge Eyan acted properly and out of necessity to avoid a discovery of astounding breadth, extraordinary expense, and only the most collateral relevance. To hold otherwise would be to leave the district courts powerless to act against discovery tactics peripheral in the extreme, perhaps dilatory in motivation, and clearly oppressive to the non-party witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-9\">The record indicates that appellants are concerned with the interpretation of the Form 22 bond and particularly with the word \u201cloan\u201d as it is used in that policy. The subpoena <em>duces tecum, </em>however, demands papers and correspondence concerning, in addition to Form 22, twelve other forms and no valid explanation is offered for their possible relevance. Thus, it was not an abuse of discretion to limit the subpoena in that respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-10\">Judge Eyan went further, however, and also protected some documents which did relate to the Form 22 bond on the ground that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-11\">\u201cUnderlying opinions, discussions and comments between the witness trade association and its members \u2014 which may or may not have been adopted or followed \u2014 are not pertinent or relevant to the words or form which were ultimately adopted and employed in the contract executed by the parties. * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b463-13\">In contract interpretation, the history of the formation of the contract may become inportant in determining the meaning of the final product and may be particularly important in a contract similar to that involved in the California litigation where the insurance companies are responsible for the wording of the contract and present it to the insured on a take-it-or-leave-it basis. In the last analysis it will be for the district court in California to determine their admissibility, but we cannot say categorically that information contained in the minutes of meetings at which the clauses of the Form 22 were discussed and communications between the Surety Association and the defendants concerning the Form 22 bond may not be relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-14\">Moreover, if it should appear that, upon production of the material we have herein ordered produced, the additional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>material appellants requested may also be relevant, our decision does not foreclose appellants from inspecting that material upon proper application.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">Finally, appellants argue that the district court erred in denying their motion to require appellee to pay the reasonable expenses incurred by them to enforce compliance with the subpoena. Rule 45 (b), Fed.R.Civ.Pro., provides that objections to a subpoena must be made prior to its return date. Appellants allege that because the Surety Association delayed until the deposition to assert its objections, it \u201ccompletely disrupted and frustrated the deposition causing the appellants unnecessary cost and causing serious inconvenience to counsel who had come from California to.take the deposition\u201d (appellant\u2019s brief, p. 31). Under the circumstances and because the bounds of the production order were so vague, the Surety Association\u2019s delay in objecting is understandable and does not seem to be as prejudicial as the appellants would like us to believe. It appears that appellants\u2019 counsel had to be in New York for other depositions so the trip across the country was not a complete loss. Appellants are not entitled to the expenses requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">The order appealed from is modified to permit the subpoena of the minutes of meetings at which the clauses of the Form 22 bond were discussed and communications between the Surety Association and the defendants concerning the Form 22 bond and, except as modified, is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b464-6\">HAYS, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"auc-dedup-0\">(concurring and dissenting):</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">I agree with Judge Moore that the additional material with respect to the Form 22 bond should be made available to the plaintiffs. However I would not confine the discovery to Form 22 materials. Other materials sought by appellants may well be relevant to \u201cthe meaning of the disputed clauses, the intentions of the insurance companies, the knowledge of ambiguities and the subsequent interpretation of trade usage and custom concerning such clauses\u201d as the appellant\u2019s brief puts it. Moreover it does not appear that appellee would be prejudiced in any way by the production of those materials or that their production would be an undue hardship for appellee.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
