Transit System, incurred temporary total disability arising out of and in the course of his employment. Appellee employer sought review of the compensation order made under the Longshoreman\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> on the ground that the disability was less than total, but it did not cross-appeal from the District Court ruling that the disability determination was supported by the record. Upon learning that appellant White had, as a result of his injury, retired from his job and was drawing monies pursuant to a pension system to which both he and D.C. Transit System had contributed, the District Court <em>sua sponte </em>ordered that the compensation award be reduced by the amount of such payments. We reverse and remand with directions to enter judgment for appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-18\">By holding that pension payments supplant compensation benefits the District Court has permitted that retirement agreement to work a waiver of statutory rights. We think this is contrary to Section 15 of the Compensation Act, which makes invalid any agreement that requires an employee to contribute to a fund maintained \u201cfor the purpose of providing compensation\u201d or by which an employee is made to \u201cwaive his right to compensation.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b633-19\">No action was begun or could have been successfully maintained to discontinue or refund pension payments. The pension plan expressly provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-20\">Allowances are in addition to any other income which an employee may have, especially in addition to any benefits provided under the Social Security Act, and any benefits received under workmen\u2019s compensation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b633-21\">Plainly the parties contracted for retirement benefits payable over and above compensation awards under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-22\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b633-13\">. <em>33 </em>U.S.C. <em>\u00a7 901 </em>ff <em>(1964). </em>This Act is made applicable in the District of Columbia by 36 D.C.Code \u00a7 501 (1967).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b633-14\">. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 915 (1964). In addition to declaring that such agreements are invalid, the Act provides that an <em>employer </em>who deducts amounts from an employee\u2019s pay to support an agreement which abrogates statutory compensation is guilty of a misdemeanor.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
