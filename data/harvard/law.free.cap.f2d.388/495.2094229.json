The Board determined that respondent had violated Section 8(a) (1) of the Act by discharging two employees, John and William Landers, for engaging in activities which were protected under the Act; respondent was ordered to cease and desist from the unfair labor practice found and to grant the Landers reinstatement and back pay. The question presented to this court is whether there was substantial evidence to s\u00fapport the Board\u2019s findings that the Landers\u2019 presentation of complaints about respondent\u2019s alleged violations of the collective bargaining contract was concerted activity protected under Section 7 and that these complaints were the reason for the discharges. We conclude that the Board\u2019s findings are supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole and enforce the Board\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-17\">The testimony at the hearing before the trial examiner revealed the following facts. On March 23, 1965, brothers John and William Landers were hired over the telephone by respondent\u2019s president Kleinhans to work as steamfitters on a construction project at Tratman Avenue in the Bronx. According to John, Klein-hans said that it would be an \u201c8-hour job\u201d and would pay \u201cexpense money\u201d;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Kleinhans testified that he did not give any such promises.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-18\">When they arrived at the jobsite on March 25, the Landers brothers met No-vak, who was also employed by respond<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>ent as a steamfitter. John found that Novak had been working alone for several days while his partner Koster \u2014 who was respondent\u2019s only other employee on this job \u2014 had been absent because of sickness; the collective bargaining contract and the New York City Fire Regulations require that steamfitters work in pairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">A short while later Soebke, respondent\u2019s supervisor, visited the jobsite. John asked him about the \u201c8-hour job\u201d and \u201cexpense money.\u201d Soebke answered that the Landers would have to speak to Kleinhans about this.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">Soebke assigned John to do some welding and William to do some other work. The Landers refused to work separately, claiming that the contract required them to work together. John pointed out to Soebke that Novak had been working without a partner and expressed doubt that Novak was an \u201cA-man\u201d qualified to work as a steamfitter.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> John also said that he was going to get the union business agent to visit the jobsite. Soebke then assigned both Landers to work together and left the site. John afterwards called the union business agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">On the following day, Koster, who was the foreman, returned and John repeated the complaints to him. John also told Koster of his conversation with Kleinhans concerning the overtime and expense money; Koster confirmed Soebke\u2019s statement that Kleinhans rarely appeared at the jobsite. John made one phone call to Kleinhans\u2019 office in order to discuss the 8-hour day and expense money, but he was unable to reach Klein-hans.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">The same day, the union business agent arrived at the site and heard John\u2019s complaints. The agent told Koster that the men were to work in pairs and that another steamfitter would be sent to replace Novak, who was not an \u201cA-man\u201d; he also ordered Koster before the executive board of the union for a briefing on a foreman\u2019s duties. John also had claimed that a prefabricated boiler which was being delivered to the jobsite violated the contract.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Koster confirmed that a prefabricated boiler was being delivered; the agent said that he would look into the matter when the boiler arrived.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-16\">On the same day, March 26, John requested Koster to supply him with protective leather equipment and Koster agreed to do so.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> John testified that, despite his repeated requests and Koster\u2019s repeated promises, he never received the equipment. Kleinhans testified that the requested equipment was provided, but John claimed that only one set was ever provided and that was used by Collins, the steamfitter who replaced Novak.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-17\">On March 29, the union business agent called Kleinhans and told him of the investigation and the action taken. Klein-hans asked who had made the complaints; the agent answered that it was irrelevant. Kleinhans then said that it looked like he had a couple of \u201ctroublemakers\u201d on the job.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-18\">On March 30, Kleinhans came to the jobsite and John, with William in attendance, asked about the 8-hour job and expense money. Kleinhans said he could see no reason for it, but might consider the request later.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-19\">On Friday, April 2, Soebke paid the employees for the work through the previous Tuesday. The Landers and Collins complained that the contract required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>that they be paid through Wednesday.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> After a discussion and a threat by John that the three of them would notify the union and would wait at the site until they received the money, Soebke agreed to bring the extra day\u2019s pay on Monday.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">The prefabricated boiler arrived on April 7 and John called the union, after he found that Koster did not intend to do so, in order to have the boiler inspected. Eventually, a union business agent did discuss the matter with Kleinhans, but he found that no violation was involved.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">Between April 7 and April 15, the Lan-ders, Collins and Koster moved the boiler and a refrigerator unit into place. John complained to Koster that the rollers and blocks available were not the standard equipment which should be provided for such an operation; William and Collins made similar complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">On Thursday, April 15, Soebke paid the Landers in full and told them they were discharged. When asked for the reason, Soebke said he had no reason but was merely carrying out orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">On April 20, John and William filed unfair labor practice charges against respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">For three months, respondent avoided stating any concrete reasons for the discharges. Kleinhans, when questioned by a union agent shortly after the discharges, said he had fired the Landers for \u201cdifferent reasons,\u201d but declined to specify the reasons. He refused to reinstate the Landers, saying that \u201cthese guys even went to the National Labor Relations Board.\u201d Kleinhans also refused to give any reason for the discharges when subsequently questioned by a Board agent. In its answer and amended answer filed in the Board proceedings, respondent defended the discharges simply on the ground that under the contract it had the right to discharge \u201cany person whom the employer, in its sole discretion, may deem fit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b546-12\">At the hearing, Kleinhans and Soebke testified that the Landers had been taking long lunch hours and had been leaving early, and that this was the reason for the discharges.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-13\">The trial examiner accepted this testimony and found that the Landers were discharged \u201cbecause of their failure to give a day\u2019s work for a day\u2019s pay.\u201d He also found that, even if the Landers were discharged for making complaints, the discharges were not discriminatory because the complaints were not for legitimate union or concerted purposes; John was the sole protagonist and the complaints were for his \u201cown selfish benefit and aggrandizement\u201d in that they were aimed at forcing the employer either to grant overtime and expenses or to incur the back pay award which would result from a discriminatory discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-14\">The Board, with one of the three panel members dissenting, rejected the findings of the trial examiner on both points, concluding that the complaints were protected activity and that they constituted the reason for the discharges. Therefore, the Board found that respondent had engaged in an unfair labor practice in violation of Section 8(a) (1), and issued an order requiring respondent to cease and desist therefrom and to make the Landers whole for any loss of pay they may have suffered as .a result of their discharges. Further, if the Trat-man Avenue job has not yet been completed, respondent is required to offer the Landers reinstatement and to post appropriate notices at the jobsite. If that job has been completed, respondent is required to notify the Landers that notwithstanding their discharges they will be considered for employment on a nondiscriminatory basis at any of respondent\u2019s projects at which they may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>choose to apply. The order also directs respondent to include in the letters to the Landers copies of the notice which would have been posted at the Tratman Avenue jobsite had it not been concluded and to mail copies of the notice to all its employees who were employed at the Trat-man Avenue project on April 15, 1965.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">This court must accept the Board\u2019s findings of fact if they are \u201csupported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(e). The trial examiner\u2019s findings are part of the record, and the fact that those findings were rejected by the Board must be considered in determining whether the \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d test is met. Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, 340 U.S. 474, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951). While this requires that some weight be given to the examiner\u2019s findings, it does not mean that \u201can examiner\u2019s findings on veracity must not be overruled without a very substantial preponderance of the evidence as recorded,\u201d the standard formulated by Learned Hand in the <em>Universal Camera </em>ease on remand, 190 F.2d 429, 430 (2 Cir. 1951). This relatively strict standard has been rejected by the Supreme Court in FCC v. Allentown Broadcasting Co., 349 U.S. 358, 364, 75 S.Ct. 855, 859, 99 L.Ed. 1147 (1955):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-6\">We think this attitude goes too far. It seems to adopt for examiners of administrative agencies the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d rule of the Fed.Rules Civ. Proe. 52(a), applicable to courts. In Universal Camera Corp. v. Labor Board, 340 U.S. 474, 492, [71 S.Ct. 456, 467, 95 L.Ed. 456], we said * * * \u201cThe responsibility for decision thus placed on the Board [by 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(c)] is wholly inconsistent with the notion that it has power to reverse an examiner\u2019s findings only when they are \u2018clearly erroneous.\u2019 Such a limitation would make so drastic a departure from prior administrative practice that explicitness would be required.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">Thus the Board may reject the examiner\u2019s findings, even though they are not clearly erroneous, if the other evidence provides sufficient support for the Board\u2019s decision. But it seems that the Board\u2019s supporting evidence, in cases where it rejects the examiner\u2019s findings, must be stronger than would be required in cases where the findings are accepted, since in the former cases the supporting evidence must be deemed substantial when measured against the examiner\u2019s contrary findings as well as the opposing evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-9\">While the standard set forth in <em>Universal Camera </em>is imprecise, \u201cit provides as much clarity as the area affords.\u201d Bon-R Reproductions, Inc. v. NLRB, 309 F.2d 898 (2 Cir. 1962). This court must look at the facts of each case and determine whether the supporting evidence, even if not preponderating in this court\u2019s view, nevertheless provides a sufficient basis for the Board\u2019s decision. We conclude that the evidence in support of the Board\u2019s decision in the present case is. sufficient to meet the \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d test.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-10\">The Board determined that John Landers\u2019 complaints constituted legitimate concerted activity, rejecting the examiner\u2019s finding that John was the sole protagonist and that his complaints were for his own personal benefit. Even if it were true that John was acting for his personal benefit, it is doubtful that a selfish motive negates the protection that the Act normally gives to Section 7 rights. In any event, the finding that John\u2019s complaints about contract violations were motivated by a desire to harass his employer into granting him overtime and expense money involves a chain of inferences which the Board was not required to draw. The record provides adequate evidence, aside from the testimony of John himself, to support the Board\u2019s conclusion that the complaints were for legitimate concerted purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-11\">Contrary to the examiner\u2019s statements that John was acting alone despite an almost complete lack of interest by his fellow employees, the testimony of William Landers, Collins, Soebke, and Kleinhans shows that on several occasions John was speaking for William and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>Collins as well as for himself. Furthermore, while interest on the part of fellow employees would indicate a concerted purpose, activities involving attempts to enforce the provisions of a collective bargaining agreement may be deemed to be for concerted purposes even in the absence of such interest by fellow employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">The examiner\u2019s conclusion that John\u2019s complaints were lacking in merit is contradicted by evidence showing that except for the requests for overtime and expenses, John\u2019s complaints were either justified or at least founded on some reasonable basis.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The trial examiner relied heavily on the union\u2019s \u201cdearth of interest\u201d in John\u2019s complaints, but the record does not support his conclusion that the union thought these complaints to be without significance. In response to John\u2019s first call, the union business agent visited the jobsite and the complaints made at that time were resolved in favor of John\u2019s position, indicating that the union found them to be meritorious. With regard to the prefabricated boiler, a union agent did follow up the complaint, although he concluded that there was in fact no violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">In these circumstances, the examiner\u2019s conclusion that neither the union nor his fellow employees saw any merit in John\u2019s complaints seems unwarranted. While those complaints may have been minor, they do not appear to have been mere fabrications. As the Board\u2019s decision points out, the Board need not find the complaints to be meritorious in order to hold the activity protected, but the fact that the complaints were apparently reasonable does support the conclusion that they were made for legitimate union purposes and were not fabricated for personal motives.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">Furthermore, neither Kleinhans nor Soebke testified that they had seen the complaints as pressure for the 8-hour job and expense money, and the record provides no direct support for the examiner\u2019s conclusion that John made the complaints to force his employer to grant these extra benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-9\">Finally, the examiner\u2019s findings were based partly on two inferences specifically rejected by the Board: that a wrongful motive may be inferred where an employee has sought a better-paying job and that a wrongful motive may be inferred where an employee has sought legal advice from a regional office of the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-10\">In view of all these considerations, we find that despite the opposing evidence and the contrary findings of the trial examiner, the evidence in support of the Board\u2019s finding on this issue is sufficient to meet the substantial evidence test.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-11\">The Board also rejected the finding of the examiner on the motive for the discharges. The examiner accepted the testimony of Kleinhans and Soebke that the Landers were discharged because they took long lunch hours and left work early. The Board gave several reasons for reversing the examiner on this matter. First, for three months the employer evaded giving the concrete reasons allegedly responsible for the discharges; this supports the inference that the reasons subsequently advanced were not in fact the basis for the discharges. Second, the Board found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>that Kleinhans\u2019 and Soebke\u2019s testimony at the hearing in support of the reasons finally stated for the discharges was not only contradictory but was at variance with statements made by each in prior affidavits. In view of these contradictions, the Board found that the testimony of Kleinhans and Soebke was not credible. Also, as the Board noted, there was ample evidence in the record showing that Kleinhans, contrary to his claim at the hearing, was aware of the Landers\u2019 complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">Furthermore, the examiner\u2019s decision to discredit the Landers\u2019 testimony that they did not leave early or take long lunches was based on three premises which the Board rejected. First, the examiner concluded that the Landers\u2019 testimony that they could not recall ever having left work prior to 3:15 amounted to an admission that they generally left work at least 15 minutes before the 3:30 quitting time. The Board found this inference to be unjustified. Second, the examiner found that John\u2019s denials that he left work early were not credible in the light of his other complaints; the Board correctly held that the fact that John made complaints about working conditions could not be used as a basis for finding his testimony on another matter incredible. Third, the examiner stated that Collins\u2019 testimony contradicted John\u2019s story in this regard; in fact, Collins corroborated the Landers\u2019 testimony on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\"> For these reasons, the Board rejected the credibility findings of the trial examiner. The Board\u2019s opinion points out that the examiner\u2019s credibility findings were not based on demeanor, and that even if they were they would be rejected in view of the contradictions noted and the fact that the Board felt those findings to be unsupported by the record as a whole. The examiner does not state that his credibility findings were based on demeanor, and while they may well have been influenced by the demeanor of the witnesses, a reading of the examiner\u2019s opinion supports the conclusion that the credibility findings purport to rest mainly on an analysis of the testimony. In these circumstances, it seems that the Board may properly give the credibility findings less weight than would be required in a case where those findings were explicitly based on demeanor.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">Therefore, we find that the record provides evidence sufficient to support the Board\u2019s rejection of the examiner\u2019s findings on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-9\">In addition to contesting the sufficiency of the evidence, respondent attacks the Board\u2019s jurisdiction contending that the Board is attempting to enforce a collective bargaining agreement and that the sole remedy is under Section 301 of the Act. This argument is without merit. The instant proceeding is to enforce the right of an employee to present complaints to his employer or supervisor in connection with the employer\u2019s violations of the agreement, not to enforce the agreement itself. And the mere fact that an employer has submitted to collective bargaining and entered into a contract with the union does not oust the Board of jurisdiction to find unfair labor practices. NLRB v. M &amp; M Oldsmobile, Inc., 377 F.2d 712 (2 Cir. 1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-10\">Enforcement granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b544-12\">. The collective bargaining agreement requires that double-time be paid for all hours in excess of the standard 7-hour day; thus an \u201c8-hour\u201d job is one that regularly provides for one hour\u2019s work at overtime pay. \u201cExpense money\u201d is an hourly sum over tbe amount provided for in tbe collective bargaining agreement; apparently, it was not unusual for steamfitters to receive this extra pay in some circumstances.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b545-9\">. The union\u2019s membership is divided into two branches: a construction branch made up of steamfitters, commonly referred to as \u201cA-men,\u201d and a service branch made up of metal tradesmen or \u201cB-men.\u201d A-men and B-men have different union books and are covered by separate collective bargaining agreements.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b545-12\">. The collective bargaining agreement requires that, with certain exceptions, all piping up to and including four inches in diameter shall be cut, threaded and have fittings screwed on either on the job or in the shop of the direct employer. The prefabricated boiler in question had piping of under four inches in diameter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b545-21\">. The contract requires the employer to furnish all necessary tools. The union business agent testified <em>that </em>the union considers the word \u201ctools\u201d to include the protective leather equipment required by steamfitters.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b546-9\">. The collective bargaining agreement provides that steamfitters shall be paid at quitting time on Friday for the week ending the Wednesday before.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b546-10\">. According to respondent, a union agent called Kleinhans, after the Landers were discharged, and inquired into the matter of the boiler. When Kleinhans told him its place of manufacture, the agent approved the boiler because it had been made in a union shop.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b548-6\">. Three of the complaints \u2014 that steamfitters could not be required to work alone, that a \u201cB-man\u201d could not be employed as a steamfitter, and that steamfitters should be paid through Wednesday \u2014 were resolved in favor of John\u2019s position and apparently were justifiable complaints. The testimony of the union business agent indicates that if in fact the leather equipment was not provided, John\u2019s complaint on this issue may have been well founded. Testimony by William Landers and Collins lends support to John\u2019s complaint that the blocks and rollers provided for moving the boiler were not standard equipment. It appears that the boiler itself did not violate the contract, see fn. 6 supra. . However, in view of the contract provision concerning prefabricated piping and the fact that the union did inquire into the matter, it seems that John may well have acted reasonably in calling the subject to the attention of the union.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
