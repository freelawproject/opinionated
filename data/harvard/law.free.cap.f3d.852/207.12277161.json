PARKER, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">Plaintiff-Appellant Andrew Carlin, individually and on behalf of others similarly situated, alleges that Defendant-Appellee Davidson Fink LLP violated the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692 <em>et seq. </em>(the \u201cFDCPA\u201d), when it failed to provide the \u201camount of the debt\u201d within five days after an initial communication with a consumer in connection with the collection of a debt, as required by \u00a7 1692g. The complaint alleges that Davidson Fink made three attempts to collect on a debt and that each time, it failed to provide adequate notice to Carlin of the amount of the debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-9\">Carlin urges us to hold that Davidson Fink\u2019s first communication, a mortgage foreclosure complaint (the \u201cForeclosure Complaint\u201d), was an initial communication with a consumer in connection with the collection of a debt, and that Davidson Fink was therefore required to provide the \u201camount of the debt\u201d within five days of filing the Foreclosure Complaint. But we decline to so hold because the plain language of the statute excludes from \u00a7 1692g pleadings in a civil action. Instead, we conclude that Davidson Fink\u2019s followup letter, an unambiguous attempt to collect on a debt, triggered the disclosure requirements of \u00a7 1692g, and that Carlin has adequately alleged that this second communication by Davidson Fink did not satisfy those requirements. We therefore vacate the order and judgment of the district court and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-11\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b236-12\">Because this appeal comes before us on a motion to dismiss, we accept as true all plausible allegations in the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-13\">Davidson Fink is a law firm whos\u00e9 practice areas include debt collection and foreclosure. Davidson Fink provides a \u201cwide-range of debt collection services,\u201d and offers \u201cimmediate and inexpensive options to recover unpaid funds with a comprehensive collection process.\u201d App. at 3. As part of its practice, Davidson Fink regularly collects consumer debts, including residential mortgage debts. There is no dispute that Davidson Fink is a debt collector within the meaning of the FDCPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-14\">On June 24, 2013, Davidson Fink filed the Foreclosure Complaint against Carlin, seeking to collect on a 2005 mortgage allegedly defaulted on by Carlin. The summons indicated that \u201c[t]he relief sought in the within action is a final judgment directing the sale of the premises described above to satisfy the debt secured by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>Mortgage described above.\u201d App. at 12. The Foreclosure Complaint stated that \u201cthis action may be deemed to be an attempt to collect a debt.\u201d App. at 17. The Foreclosure Complaint also included a paragraph requesting:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-5\">That if the proceeds of said sale of the mortgage premises aforesaid be insufficient to pay the amount found due to the plaintiff with interest and costs, the officer making the sale be required to specify the amount of such deficiency in his report of sale so that plaintiff may thereafter be able to make application to this Court, pursuant to Section 1371 of the Real Property Actions and Proceedings Law, for a judgment against the defendant(s) referred to in paragraph FOURTH of this Complaint for any deficiency which may remain after applying all of such moneys so applicable thereto, except that this shall not apply to any defendant who has been discharged in bankruptcy from the subject debt[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">App. at 18. Section 1371 of the New York Real Property Actions and Proceedings Law provides that \u201c[simultaneously with the making of a motion for an order confirming the sale, ... the party to whom such residue shall be owing may make a motion in the action for leave to enter a deficiency judgment....\u201d N.Y. Real Prop. Acts. Law \u00a7 1371(2) (2016).</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">Davidson Fink attached to the Foreclosure Complaint a \u201cNotice Required by the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act,\u201d which stated that \u201cthe amount of the debt is stated in the complaint hereto attached,\u201d and also that \u201cthe debt ... will be assumed to be valid ... unless the debtor, within thirty (30) days after receipt of this notice, disputes the validity of the debt.\u201d App. at 21. Contrary to the assurance made in the attached notice, the Foreclosure Complaint did not state the amount of the debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-9\">Apparently prompted by the Foreclosure Complaint\u2019s warnings, Carlin sent Davidson Fink a letter on July 12, 2013 (the \u201cJuly Letter\u201d), disputing the validity of the debt and requesting a verification of the dollar amount of the purported debt. Davidson Fink obliged, and on August 9, 2013, sent a letter (the \u201cAugust Letter\u201d) to Carlin containing, among other things, a Payoff Statement. The Payoff Statement was dated July 31, 2013, and indicated that it was valid through August 14, 2013. The Payoff Statement included a \u201cTotal Amount Due\u201d of $205,261.79. Below the amount due, however, the statement added, in small print:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-10\">To provide you with the convenience of an extended \u201cStatement Void After\u201d date, the Total Amount Due may include estimated fees, costs, additional payments and/or escrow disbursements that will become due prior to the \u201cStatement Void After\u201d date, but which are not yet due as of the date this Payoff Statement is issued. You will receive a refund if you pay the Total Amount Due and those anticipated fees, expenses, or payments have not been incurred.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-11\">App. at 55. The Payoff Statement did not indicate what those estimated fees, costs, or additional payments were or how they were calculated.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-12\">Carlin brought this action alleging that Davidson Fink violated the FDCPA, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-13\">Within five days after the initial communication with a consumer in connection with the collection of any debt, a debt collector shall, unless the following information is contained in the initial communication or the consumer has paid the debt, send the consumer a written notice containing\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-14\">(1) the amount of the debt....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692g(a). Carlin alleges that the filing of the Foreclosure Complaint was an \u201cinitial communication ... in connection with the collection of any debt,\u201d and because Davidson Fink failed to specify the amount of the debt within five days of filing the complaint, it is liable for damages under the FDCPA. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 1692k. Alternatively, Carlin alleges that Davidson Fink was required to respond with the amount of the debt within five days of receiving the July Letter. Finally, Carlin alleges that if neither the Foreclosure Complaint nor the July Letter was an initial communication, then the August Letter was an initial communication made in connection with the collection of a debt and the Payoff Statement did not satisfy \u00a7 1692g(a) because the amount due included unaccrued and unspecified fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">Davidson Fink moved to dismiss for failure to state a claim. In September 2014, the district court (Seybert, /.) denied the motion, saying that Carlin had plausibly alleged that Davidson Fink was acting as a debt collector, that it engaged in an initial communication with Carlin, and that it failed to comply with \u00a7 1692g(a). Davidson Fink moved for reconsideration, and in September 2015, the district court granted the motion and dismissed the complaint, holding that because the Foreclosure Complaint was not an effort to collect on a debt within the meaning of \u00a7 1692g(a), the complaint failed to plausibly state a claim. Carlin appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of a defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss <em>de novo. Hart v. FCI Lender Servs., Inc., </em>797 F.3d 219, 223 (2d Cir. 2015). To survive a motion to dismiss, \u201ca complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to \u2018state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u2019\u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (quoting <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007)). We must \u201caccept as true all of the allegations contained in a complaint,\u201d though \u201c[t]hread-bare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Though we are confined \u201cto the allegations contained within the four corners of [the] complaint,\u201d <em>Pani v. Empire Blue Cross Blue Shield, </em>152 F.3d 67, 71 (2d Cir. 1998), we may also consider any \u201cdocuments attached to the complaint as an exhibit or incorporated in it by reference,\u201d <em>Chambers v. Time Warner, Inc., </em>282 F.3d 147, 153 (2d Cir. 2002) (quoting <em>Brass v. Am. Film Techs., Inc., </em>987 F.2d 142, 150 (2d Cir. 1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">In assessing Carlin\u2019s claim, \u00a7 1692g(a) calls upon us to make three determinations: (1) whether any of the communications between the parties were \u201cinitial communications\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 1692g, (2) whether any of the communications between the parties were \u201cin connection with the collection of any debt,\u201d and (3) whether Davidson Fink provided the amount of the debt within five days of such a communication. We agree with Davidson Fink that neither the Foreclosure Complaint nor the July Letter are initial communications giving rise to the requirements of \u00a7 1692g(a). We hold, however, that the August Letter was an initial communication in connection with the collection of a debt, and that the Payoff Statement attached to the August Letter did not adequately state the amount of the debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-9\">A. Initial Communication</p>\n<p id=\"b238-10\">The FDCPA does not offer a definition of \u201cinitial communication.\u201d In <em>Goldman v. Cohen, </em>we held that a \u201cdebt collector\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>initiation of a lawsuit in state court seeking recovery of unpaid consumer debts is an \u2018initial communication\u2019 within the meaning of the FDCPA.\u201d 445 F.3d 152, 155 (2d Cir. 2006). After <em>Goldman, </em>however, Congress amended the FDCPA in 2006 to clarify that \u201c[a] communication in the form of a formal pleading in a civil action shall not be treated as an initial communication for purposes of subsection (a) of this section.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692g(d) (added by the Financial Services Regulatory Relief Act of 2006, Pub. L. No. 109-351, \u00a7 802(a), 120 Stat. 1966, 2006-07 (2006)). We have recognized that this amendment supersedes our determination in <em>Goldman. See Ellis v. Solomon &amp; Solomon, P.C., </em>591 F.3d 130, 136 (2d Cir. 2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">Despite the plain language of the statute, Carlin insists that the Foreclosure Complaint is an initial communication. Carlin argues that our holding in <em>Hart, </em>797 F.3d at 224, makes clear that a \u00a7 1692g notice is an initial communication. Here, Davidson Fink attached such a notice to the Foreclosure Complaint, although it was not required to do so, and Carlin argues that because the notice was not part of the \u201cformal pleading,\u201d it does not fall within the exception for formal civil pleadings provided in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">Carlin\u2019s argument finds no refuge in the text of the statute. Section 1692g(d) states that a \u201ccommunication in the form of a formal pleading in a civil action\u201d is not an initial communication. We have recognized that \u201ccourts should avoid statutory interpretations that render provisions superfluous.\u201d <em>State St. Bank &amp; Tr. Co. v. Salovaara, </em>326 F.3d 130, 139 (2d Cir. 2003). Were we to adopt Carlin\u2019s reading that the exclusion applies only to the formal documents that make up a standard pleading, we would be ignoring the plain language instructing that all communications in the <em>form </em>of a civil pleading are excluded from the definition of initial communication. Congress could have drawn the exclusion more narrowly, but it did not. Instead, it adopted a broad exclusion that, on its face, applies to any communication forming any part of a pleading. Such an exclusion naturally extends to exhibits attached to a complaint, and accordingly includes the \u00a7 1692g notice attached to the Foreclosure Complaint. Thus, we hold that even documents that are superfluously attached to a formal pleading are not initial communications within the meaning of the FDCPA.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b239-9\">Carlin protests that the \u00a7 1692g notice is misleading because it erroneously instructed him that he had 30 days to dispute the debt, which, according to the position now taken by Davidson Fink, was false. But Carlin has not alleged in his complaint that the notice was misleading, only that it failed to state the amount of the debt. Should Carlin wish to amend his complaint to state such a claim, that issue must be decided by the district court in the first instance, and we express no view on the merits of such a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-10\">Carlin next alleges that the July Letter, sent from him to Davidson Fink in response to the Foreclosure Complaint, is an initial communication. Numerous district courts have rejected the notion that a communication initiated by a debtor to a debt collector may qualify as an initial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>communication. <em>See, e.g., Derisme v. Hunt Leibert Jacobson P.C., </em>880 F.Supp.2d 339, 367-68 (D. Conn. 2012); <em>Lane v. Fein, Such &amp; Crane, LLP, </em>767 F.Supp.2d 382, 387 (E.D.N.Y. 2011); <em>Gorham-Dimaggio v. Countrywide Home Loans, Inc., </em>No. 1:05-cv-0583, 2005 WL 2098068, at *2 (N.D.N.Y. Aug. 30, 2005). Like those courts, we conclude that, read in the context of the entire statute, initial communications do not include communications initiated by the debtor.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">\u201cWhen construing a statute, we begin with its language and proceed under the assumption that the statutory language, unless otherwise defined, carries its plain meaning.... \u201d <em>Chen v. Major League Baseball Props., Inc., </em>798 F.3d 72, 76 (2d Cir. 2015). The statute specifies that the communication must be \u201cwith\u201d a consumer. We cannot discern from this alone whether the statute should be read to exclude communications initiated by the consumer. Where statutory language is ambiguous, we may consider legislative history, but in doing so, we must \u201cconstruct an interpretation that comports with [the statute\u2019s] primary purpose and does not lead to anomalous or unreasonable results.\u201d <em>Puello v. Bureau of Citizenship &amp; Immigration Servs., </em>511 F.3d 324, 327 (2d Cir. 2007) (alteration in original) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting <em>Connecticut ex rel. Blumenthal v. United States Dep\u2019t of the Interior, </em>228 F.3d 82, 89 (2d Cir. 2000)); <em>see also Romea v. Heiberger &amp; Assocs., </em>163 F.3d 111, 118 (2d Cir. 1998) (noting that the court should avoid interpreting the FDCPA to \u201ccontravene[ ] the purpose of the statute\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">The FDCPA states that its purpose is to \u201celiminate abusive debt collection practices <em>by debt collectors.\u201d </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692(e) (emphasis added). We have similarly recognized that the \u201cFDCPA was passed to protect consumers from deceptive or harassing actions taken <em>by debt collectors.\u201d Kropelnicki v. Siegel, </em>290 F.3d 118, 127 (2d Cir. 2002) (emphasis added). And the legislative history makes clear that the debt collector\u2019s obligation to provide the amount of the debt arises only \u201c[a]fter initially contacting a consumer.\u201d S. Rep. No. 95-382, at 4 (1977), <em>reprinted in </em>1977 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1695, 1699. The legislative history and stated purpose of the statute thus indicate that the statute\u2019s primary purpose, particularly where \u00a7 1692g is implicated, is to regulate communications from the debt collector to the debtor. Thus, imposing liability under \u00a7 1692g when a debtor initiates the communication would run counter to the statute\u2019s primary purpose and would impose liability in circumstances not contemplated by either the statute or the legislature. Accordingly, the July Letter is not an initial communication under the FDCPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">We have little difficulty concluding, however, that the August Letter was an initial communication. Davidson Fink argues that the protections of the FDCPA are not implicated where the debtor is protected by the procedures of the court system. Davidson Fink\u2019s argument fails because the August Letter was not sent in the context of a litigation, nor was it even sent to Carlin\u2019s attorney. The cases cited by Davidson Fink are inapposite \u2014 those cases, which concern only misrepresentations under \u00a7 1692e, all involve representations made to an attorney representing the debtor, usually in the context of a formal proceeding. <em>See, e.g., Gabriele v. Am. Home Mortg. Servicing, Inc., </em>503 Fed.Appx. 89, 92 (2d Cir. 2012) (alleged misstatements made in state foreclosure action); <em>Simmons v. Roundup Funding, LLC, </em>622 F.3d 93, 95 (2d Cir. 2010) (alleged misstatements made in bankruptcy filing); <em>Kropelnicki, </em>290 F.3d at 123 (alleged misstatement made over the phone <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>to attorney during settlement discussions). Here, by contrast, the August Letter was not sent in connection with the foreclosure proceeding, and in fact makes no mention of the proceeding. Furthermore, the letter was not sent to Carlin\u2019s attorney, who had already appeared on behalf of Carlin in the foreclosure proceeding, but to Carlin himself. Davidson Fink is thus incorrect that Carlin was amply protected by the procedures of the court system.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">Nor can we say that the August Letter was merely a response to an unsolicited request for information. The August Letter was sent in response to the July Letter, which was only sent in the first place because Carlin was under the mistaken impression that he was required to dispute the debt within thirty days. In light of such circumstances, there is little dispute that the August Letter was an initial communication within the meaning of the FDCPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">B. In Connection With the Collection of Any Debt</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">Having determined that only the August Letter is an initial communication, we must assess whether the letter was sent \u201cin connection with the collection of any debt.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692g(a). In addressing this question at the motion to dismiss stage, our role is to determine merely whether, when viewed objectively, the plaintiff \u201chas plausibly alleged that a consumer receiving the communication could reasonably interpret it as being sent \u2018in connection with the collection of [a] debt,\u2019 rather than inquiring into the sender\u2019s subjective purpose.\u201d <em>Hart, </em>797 F.3d at 225 (alteration in original). In <em>Hart, </em>we determined that the letter in question was unambiguously sent in connection with the collection of a debt because: (1) the letter directed the recipient to mail payments to a specified address, (2) the letter referred to the FDCPA by name, (3) the letter informed the recipient that he had to dispute the debt\u2019s validity within thirty days, and (4) most importantly, the letter \u201cemphatically announcefd] itself as an attempt at debt collection: \u2018THIS IS AN ATTEMPT TO COLLECT UPON A DEBT, AND ANY INFORMATION OBTAINED WILL BE USED FOR THAT PURPOSE.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 226. We had \u201cno difficulty in concluding\u201d that the communication in question was an attempt to collect on a debt within the meaning of the FDCPA. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b241-9\">Here, too, the August Letter is unambiguous. The Payoff Statement provides addresses to which Carlin was instructed to mail or wire his payments, the cover letter mentions the FDCPA by name, and, most notably, the letter states: \u201cPLEASE BE ADVISED THAT DAVIDSON FINK LLP IS A LAW FIRM ACTING AS A DEBT COLLECTOR. THIS IS AN ATTEMPT TO COLLECT A DEBT. ANY INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM YOU WILL BE USED FOR THAT PURPOSE.\u201d App. at 54. These factors, disposi-tive in <em>Hart, </em>are similarly instructive here and demonstrate that Carlin has adequately pleaded that the August Letter was sent in connection with the collection of a debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-10\">C. Amount of the Debt</p>\n<p id=\"b241-11\">The remaining inquiry is whether Davidson Fink adequately stated the amount of the debt in the August Letter, as required by \u00a7 1692g. We conclude that it did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-12\">The Payoff Statement included a \u201cTotal Amount Due,\u201d but that amount may have included unspecified \u201cfees, costs, additional payments, and/or escrow disbursements\u201d that were not yet due at the time the statement was issued. The Payoff Statement indicated that any such fees would accrue by August 14, 2013 (the date on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>which the Payoff Statement became void), and that if payment of the \u201cTotal Amount Due\u201d was made prior to August 14, Carlin would receive a refund in the amount of the unaccrued fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">When determining whether a debt collector has violated \u00a7 1692g\u2019s notice requirements, we consider how the \u201cleast sophisticated consumer\u201d would interpret the notice. <em>See Russell v. Equifax A.R.S., </em>74 F.3d 30, 34 (2d Cir. 1996) (citing <em>Clomon v. Jackson, </em>988 F.2d 1314, 1318 (2d Cir. 1993)). We ask whether \u201cthe notice fails to convey the required information \u2018clearly and effectively and thereby makes the least sophisticated consumer uncertain\u2019 as to the meaning of the message.\u201d <em>DeSantis v. Computer Credit, Inc., </em>269 F.3d 159, 161 (2d Cir. 2001) (quoting <em>Savino v. Computer Credit, Inc., </em>164 F.3d 81, 85 (2d Cir. 1998)). Thus, even if a debt collector accurately conveys the required information, a consumer may state a claim if she successfully alleges that the least sophisticated consumer would inaccurately interpret the message.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">It is unclear whether Davidson Fink\u2019s notice accurately conveys the required information. The FDCPA defines \u201cdebt\u201d as \u201cany obligation or alleged obligation of a consumer to pay money arising out of a transaction ..., whether or not such obligation has been reduced to judgment.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692a(5). The Seventh Circuit has expressed doubt that \u201cdebt\u201d includes unac-crued court costs or attorney fees. <em>See Veach v. Sheeks, </em>316 F.3d 690, 693 (7th Cir. 2003). But the Payoff Statement does not specify what the \u201cestimated fees, costs, [and] additional payments\u201d are, and thus we cannot say whether those amounts are properly part of the amount of the debt.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> If Davidson Fink improperly included fees and costs that it was not entitled to under the note (absent a judgment), the Payoff Statement would plainly be insufficient under \u00a7 1692g.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-11\">The least sophisticated consumer standard we use to interpret the legal effect of FDCPA notices supports this conclusion. Absent fuller disclosure, an unsophisticated consumer may not understand how these fees are calculated, whether they may be disputed, or what provision of the note gives rise to them. Because the statement gives no indication as to what the unaccrued fees are or how they are calculated, she cannot deduce that information from the statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-12\">We do not hold that a debt collector may never satisfy its obligations under \u00a7 1692g by providing a payoff statement that provides an amount due, including expected fees and costs. But a statement is incomplete where, as here, it omits information allowing the least sophisticated consumer to determine the minimum amount she owes at the time of the notice, what she will need to pay to resolve the debt at any given moment in the future, and an explanation of any fees and interest that will cause the balance to increase.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-13\">We are not ignorant of the safe-harbor statement we formulated in <em>Avila v. Riexinger &amp; Assocs., LLC, </em>817 F.3d 72 (2d Cir. 2016). There, we held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-14\">[A] debt collector will not be subject to liability under Section 1692e for failing to disclose that the consumer\u2019s balance may increase due to interest and fees if the collection notice either accurately informs the consumer that the amount of the debt stated in the letter will increase <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>over time, or clearly states that the holder of the debt will accept payment of the amount set forth in full satisfaction of the debt if payment is made by a specified date.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">817 F.3d at 77. However, the Payoff Statement only expresses that the Total Amount Due <em>may </em>include <em>estimated </em>fees and costs. There is no clarity as to whether new fees and costs are accruing or as to the basis for those fees and costs.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">Notices such as the Payoff Statement here may very well be commonplace in the debt collection industry. But the FDCPA does not insulate a debt collector from liability merely because others in the industry engage in the same practice. It is no great chore for Davidson Fink and other debt collectors to revise their standard payoff statements to clarify the actual amount due, the basis of the fees, or simply some information that would allow the least sophisticated consumer to deduce the amount she actually owes.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">Because Carlin has adequately alleged that the August Letter is an initial communication sent by a debt collector in connection with the collection of a debt and that it does not clearly state the amount of the debt, we vacate the order and judgment of the district court and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b239-7\">. Because we conclude that the erroneously attached notice was not an initial communication, we need not confront the parties' extensive arguments regarding whether the initiation of a foreclosure action is done \"in connection with the collection of any debt.\u201d Nor do we need to consider the district court\u2019s interpretation of the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s ruling in <em>Reese v. Ellis, Painter, Ratterree &amp; Adams, LLP, </em>678 F.3d 1211 (11th Cir. 2012), as that case offers little guidance on the issues we confront here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b242-6\">. The only additional fee beyond principal and interest referenced in the underlying note is a <em>2% </em>\"Late Charge for Overdue Payments.\u201d [JA155] The Payoff Statement does not indicate whether the late charge is part of the \"fees, costs, [and] additional payments\u201d included in the Total Amount Due.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b243-10\">. As we explained in <em>Avila, </em>though not required by the text of the statute, a notice would also satisfy \u00a7 1692g if it used language such as : \u201cAs of today, [date], you owe $_ This amount consists of a principal of $_, accrued interest of $_, and fees of $.__ This balance will continue to accrue interest after [date] at a rate of $_per [date/week/ month/year].\u201d 817 F.3d at 77 n. 2 (citing <em>Jones v. Midland Funding, LLC., </em>755 F.Supp.2d 393, 397 n. 7).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
