The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Failla, <em>J.) </em>dismissed Christiansen\u2019s federal claims pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim and declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over his state and local claims. <em>See Christiansen v. Omnicom Grp., Inc., </em>167 F.Supp.3d 598, 612, 616-18, 622 (S.D.N.Y. 2016). In its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>decision, the district court concluded that <em>Simonton v. Runyon, </em>232 F.3d 33 (2d Cir. 2000), and <em>Dawson v. Bumble &amp; Bumble, </em>398 F.3d 211 (2d Cir. 2005), holding that Title VII does not prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, precluded Christiansen\u2019s Title VII claim. <em>Christiansen, </em>167 F.Supp.3d at 618, 622. Christiansen primarily appeals this aspect of the district court\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">Christiansen, an openly gay man who is HIV-positive, worked as an associate creative director and later creative director at DDB Worldwide Communications Group, Inc., an international advertising agency and subsidiary of Omnicom Group, Inc. Christiansen\u2019s complaint alleged that his direct supervisor engaged in a pattern of humiliating harassment targeting his effeminacy and sexual orientation. According to Christiansen, in the spring and summer of 2011, his supervisor drew multiple sexually suggestive and explicit drawings of Christiansen on an office whiteboard. The most graphic of the images depicted a naked, muscular Christiansen with an erect penis, holding a manual air pump and accompanied by a text bubble reading, \u201cI\u2019m so pumped for marriage equality.\u201d J.A. at 16 \u00b6 34.C; J.A. at 42. Another depicted Christiansen in tights and a low-cut shirt \u201cprancing around.\u201d J.A. at 16 \u00b6 34.A; J.A. at 40. A third depicted Chris-tiansen's torso on the body of \u201ca four legged animal with a tail and penis, urinating and defecating.\u201d J.A. at 16 \u00b6 34.B; J.A. at 41. Later in 2011, Christiansen\u2019s supervisor circulated at work and posted to Facebook a \u201cMuscle Beach Party\u201d poster that depicted various employees\u2019 heads on the bodies of people in beach attire. J.A. at 13 \u00b6 30. Christiansen\u2019s head was attached to a female body clad in a bikini, lying on the ground with her legs upright in the air in a manner that one coworker thought depicted Christiansen as \u201ca submissive sissy.\u201d J.A. at 13 \u00b6 30; J.A. at 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">Christiansen\u2019s supervisor also made remarks about the connection between effeminacy, sexual orientation, and HIV status. The supervisor allegedly told other employees that Christiansen \u201cwas effeminate and gay so he must have AID[S].\u201d J.A. at 15 \u00b6 30. Additionally, in May 2013, in a meeting of about 20 people, the supervisor allegedly told everyone in the room that he felt sick and then said to Christian-sen, \u201cIt feels like I have AIDS. Sorry, you know what that\u2019s like.\u201d J.A. at 17 \u00b6 38. At that time, Christiansen kept private the fact that he was HIV-positive.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-9\">On October 19, 2014, Christiansen submitted a complaint to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\u201cEEOC\u201d) detailing the harassment described above. After receiving a \u201cNotice of Right to Sue\u201d from the EEOC, Christiansen filed this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on May 4, 2015. Shortly thereafter, defendants moved to dismiss the complaint. In their motion to dismiss, defendants argued, <em>inter alia, </em>that Christiansen\u2019s claim under Title VII was a sexual orientation discrimination claim rather than a gender stereotyping claim and was thus not cognizable under <em>Simonton v. Runyon, </em>232 F.3d 33 (2d Cir. 2000), and <em>Dawson v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number><em>Bumble &amp; Bumble, </em>398 F.3d 211 (2d Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">The district court agreed. In its decision, the district court described at length difficulties in distinguishing sexual orientation discrimination claims from gender stereotyping claims, specifically noting that negative views people hold of those with certain sexual orientations may be based on stereotypes about appropriate romantic associations between men and women. <em>See Christiansen, </em>167 F.Supp.3d at 619-20. Having reviewed the decisions of other district courts addressing this issue in the wake of <em>Simonton </em>and <em>Dawson, </em>the district court concluded that \u201cno coherent line can be drawn between these two sorts of claims.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 620. Nevertheless, the district court recognized that \u201cthe prevailing law in this Circuit \u2014 and, indeed, every Circuit to consider the question \u2014 is that such a line must be drawn.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Although the district court considered several references to effeminacy in the complaint, it concluded that, as a whole, Christiansen\u2019s complaint did not allege that he was discriminated against because he did not conform to gender stereotypes, but because he was gay. <em>Id. </em>at 620-22. As a result, the district court held that Christiansen\u2019s claim was a sexual orientation discrimination claim that was not cognizable under Title VII pursuant to <em>Simonton </em>and <em>Dawson </em>and dismissed the claim under Rule 12(b)(6). <em>Id. </em>at 622.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">\u201cWe review a District Court\u2019s grant of a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim <em>de novo, </em>accepting the complaint\u2019s factual allegations as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in the plaintiffs favor.\u201d <em>Carpenters Pension Tr. Fund of St. Louis v. Barclays PLC, </em>750 F.3d 227, 232 (2d Cir. 2014) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cTo survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to \u2018state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (quoting <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955,167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007)). To meet this standard, a plaintiff must \u201cplead[] factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b225-9\">Title VII makes it \u201can unlawful employment practice for an employer ... to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his [or her] compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual\u2019s ... sex.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(l). On appeal, Christiansen argues, supported by various <em>amici, </em>that we should reconsider our decisions in <em>Simonton </em>and <em>Dawson </em>in light of a changed legal landscape and hold that Title VU\u2019s prohibition of discrimination \u201cbecause of ... sex\u201d encompasses discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. Because we are \u201cbound by the decisions of prior panels until such time as they are overruled either by an en banc panel of our Court or by the Supreme Court,\u201d <em>United States v. Wilkerson, </em>361 F.3d 717, 732 (2d Cir. 2004), \u201cit [is] ordinarily ... neither appropriate nor possible for [a panel] to reverse an existing Circuit precedent,\u201d <em>Shipping Corp. of India Ltd. v. Jaldhi Overseas Pte Ltd., </em>585 F.3d 58, 67 (2d Cir. 2009). We thus lack the power to reconsider <em>Simonton </em>and <em>Dawson.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b225-11\">However, we disagree with the district court\u2019s conclusion that Christiansen failed to plausibly allege a Title VII claim based on the gender stereotyping theory of sex discrimination articulated in <em>Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, </em>490 U.S. 228, 109 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>S.Ct. 1775, 104 L.Ed.2d 268 (1989), which is also binding on this panel. In Price <em>Waterhouse, </em>the female plaintiff, a senior manager at an accounting firm, was described as \u201cmacho\u201d and \u201cmasculine\u201d and informed that \u201cto improve her chances for partnership, ... [she] should walk more femininely, talk more femininely, dress more femininely, wear make-up, have her hair styled, and wear jewelry.\u201d 490 U.S. at 231-32, 235, 109 S.Ct. 1775 (internal quotation marks omitted). After her office declined to nominate her for partnership, she sued under Title VII alleging sex discrimination. <em>Id. </em>at 231-33, 109 S.Ct. 1775. Six members of the Supreme Court held that adverse employment action rooted in \u201csex stereotyping\u201d or \u201cgender stereotyping\u201d was actionable sex discrimination. <em>Id. </em>at 250-52, 109 S.Ct. 1775 (plurality); <em>see also id. </em>at 258, 109 S.Ct. 1775 (White, J., concurring); <em>id. </em>at 272-73, 109 S.Ct. 1775 (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">Here, as noted above, Christiansen\u2019s complaint identifies multiple instances of gender stereotyping discrimination. His complaint alleges that his supervisor described him as \u201ceffeminate\u201d to others in the office, J.A. at 15 \u00b6 30, and depicted him in tights and a low-cut shirt \u201cprancing around,\u201d J.A. at 16 \u00b6 34.A; J.A. at 40. The complaint further alleges that the \u201cMuscle Beach Party\u201d party poster, depicting Christiansen\u2019s head attached to a bikini-clad female body lying on the ground with her legs in the air, was seen by at least one coworker as portraying Christiansen \u201cas a submissive sissy.\u201d J.A. 13 \u00b6 30. The district court acknowledged these facts but concluded that because Christiansen\u2019s complaint contained fewer allegations about his effeminacy than about his sexual orientation, the allegations about his effeminacy did not \u201ctransform a claim for discrimination that Plaintiff plainly interpreted \u2014 and the facts support \u2014 as stemming from sexual orientation animus into one for sexual stereotyping.\u201d <em>Christiansen, </em>167 F.Supp.3d at 621. The district court also opined that permitting Christiansen\u2019s Title VII claim to proceed \u201cwould obliterate the line the Second Circuit has drawn, rightly or wrongly, between sexual orientation and sex-based claims.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 622.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">The district court\u2019s decision draws attention to some confusion in our Circuit about the relationship between' gender stereotyping and sexual orientation discrimination claims. Some district courts in this Circuit have viewed <em>Simonton </em>and <em>Dawson </em>as making it \u201cespecially difficult for gay plaintiffs to bring\u201d gender stereotyping claims. <em>Maroney v. Waterbury Hosp., </em>No. 3:10-CV-1415 (JCH), 2011 WL 1085633, at *2 n.2 (D. Conn. Mar. 18, 2011); <em>see also Estate of D.B. v. Thousand Islands Cent. Sch. Dist., </em>169 F.Supp.3d 320, 332-33 (N.D.N.Y. 2016) (\u201cThe critical fact under the circumstances is the actual sexual orientation of the harassed person.\u201d). Such cases misapprehend the nature of our rulings in <em>Simonton </em>and <em>Dawson. </em>While <em>Simonton </em>observed that the gender stereotyping theory articulated in <em>Price Waterhouse </em>\u201cwould not bootstrap protection for sexual orientation into Title VII because not all homosexual men are stereotypically feminine,\u201d 232 F.3d at 38, it acknowledged that, at a minimum, \u201cstereotypically feminine\u201d gay men <em>could </em>pursue a gender stereotyping claim under Title VII (and the same principle would apply to \u201cstereotypically masculine\u201d lesbian women). <em>Simonton </em>and <em>Dawson </em>do not suggest that a \u201cmasculine\u201d woman like the plaintiff in <em>Price Waterhouse, </em>490 U.S. at 235, 109 S.Ct. 1775, has an actionable Title VII claim unless she is a lesbian; to the contrary, the sexual orientation of the plaintiff in <em>Price Waterhouse </em>was of no consequence. In sum, gay, lesbian, and bisexual individuals do not have <em>less </em>protection under <em>Price Waterhouse </em>against traditional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>gender stereotype discrimination than do heterosexual individuals. <em>Simonton </em>and <em>Dawson </em>merely hold that being gay, lesbian, or bisexual, standing alone, does not constitute nonconformity with a gender stereotype that can give rise to a cognizable gender stereotyping claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">The gender stereotyping allegations in Christiansen\u2019s complaint are cognizable under <em>Price Waterhouse </em>and our precedents. Christiansen alleges that he was perceived by his supervisor as effeminate and submissive and that he was harassed for these reasons. Furthermore, the harassment to which he was subjected, particularly the \u201cMuscle Beach Party\u201d poster, is alleged to have specifically invoked these \u201cstereotypically feminine\u201d traits. <em>Simonton, </em>232 F.3d at 38. The district court commented that much more of the complaint was devoted to sexual orientation discrimination allegations than gender stereotyping discrimination allegations <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and that it thus might be difficult for Christiansen to withstand summary judgment or prove at trial that he was harassed because of his perceived effeminacy and flouting of gender stereotypes rather than because of his sexual orientation. Even if that were Christiansen\u2019s burden at summary judgment or at trial \u2014 and we do not hold here that it is \u2014 it is not our task at the motion to dismiss stage to weigh the evidence and evaluate the likelihood that Christiansen would prevail on his Title VII gender stereotyping claim. Instead, we assess whether he has \u201cstate[d] a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. at 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937 (quoting <em>Twombly, </em>550 U.S. at 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955). We hold that he has.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b227-9\">For the foregoing reasons, we REVERSE the district court\u2019s dismissal of Christiansen\u2019s Title VII claim and REMAND for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. We AFFIRM the judgment of the district court in all other respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-10\">KATZMANN, Chief Judge, concurs in a separate opinion, in which BRODIE, District Judge, joins.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b224-6\">. Christiansen also purports to challenge the district court\u2019s dismissal of his ADA claim for failure to comply with the statute of limitations. The district court, however, did not dismiss the ADA claim on this basis and instead concluded that Christiansen did not allege facts constituting discrimination under the ADA. <em>Christiansen, </em>167 F.Supp.3d at 613-17. We thus need not consider Christiansen's statute of limitations argument, and we affirm the district court's dismissal of Christiansen\u2019s ADA claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b227-6\">. This highlights an issue that may arise when a plaintiff alleges discrimination under Title VII as well as under state and local laws that <em>do </em>prohibit sexual orientation discrimination. <em>See, e.g., </em>N.Y. Exec. Law \u00a7 296(l)(a); N.Y.C. Admin. Code \u00a7 8-107(l)(a). In such a case, one would expect a plaintiff to detail alleged instances of sexual orientation discrimination in violation of state and local law alongside alleged instances of gender stereotyping discrimination in violation of federal law. When evaluating such a complaint, courts should not rely on the mere fact that a complaint alleges sexual orientation discrimination to find that a plaintiff fails to state a separate claim for gender stereotyping discrimination, but should instead independently evaluate the allegations of gender stereotyping.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b227-15\">. Defendants argue on appeal that Christian-sen\u2019s Title VII claim is time-barred. Chris-tiansen responds that the continuing violation doctrine and equitable estoppel apply to his claims. Because the district court did not reach the time-bar issue below, we will not decide it here in the first instance. Instead, we leave it to the district court to determine, on remand, whether Christiansen's claims are time-barred.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b227-11\">KATZMANN, Chief Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AVuF\">with whom BRODIE, District Judge, joins, concurring:</p>\n<p id=\"b227-12\">To ascertain whether Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits sexual orientation discrimination, we begin with the text:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-13\">It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer ... to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge ... or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his [or her] compensation, terms, conditions, or priv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>ileges of employment, because of such individual's ... sex ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(l). Christiansen and <em>amici </em>advance three arguments, none previously addressed by this Court, that sexual orientation discrimination is, almost by definition, discrimination \u201cbecause of ... sex.\u201d They argue first that sexual orientation discrimination is discrimination \u201cbecause of ... sex\u201d because gay, lesbian, and bisexual individuals are treated in a way that would be different \u201cbut for\u201d their sex. Second, they argue that sexual orientation discrimination is discrimination \u201cbecause of ... sex\u201d because gay, lesbian, and bisexual individuals are treated less favorably based on the sex of their associates. Finally, they argue that sexual orientation discrimination is discrimination \u201cbecause of ... sex\u201d because gay, lesbian, and bisexual individuals are treated less favorably because they do not conform to gender stereotypes, particularly stereotypes about the proper roles of men and women in romantic relationships. I find persuasive these arguments, which reflect the evolving legal landscape since our Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Simonton v. Runyon, </em>232 F.3d 33 (2d Cir. 2000), and <em>Dawson v. Bumble &amp; Bumble, </em>398 F.3d 211 (2d Cir. 2005), holding that sexual orientation discrimination claims are not cognizable under Title VII. Concluding that it was constrained by the law as it then was, the <em>Simonton </em>Court expressly decried the \u201cappalling persecution,\u201d 232 F.3d at 35, that Simonton endured because of his sexual orientation, stating that such persecution was \u201cmorally reprehensible whenever and in whatever context it occurs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>For the reasons that follow, I write separately to express my view that when the appropriate occasion presents itself, it would make sense for the Court to revisit the central legal issue confronted in <em>Simonton </em>and <em>Dawson, </em>especially in light of the changing legal landscape that has taken shape in the nearly two decades since <em>Simonton </em>issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">I. Sexual Orientation Discrimination As Traditional Sex Discrimination</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">First, sexual orientation discrimination is sex discrimination for the simple reason that such discrimination treats otherwise similarly-situated people differently solely because of their sex. A person is discriminated against \u201cbecause of ... sex\u201d if that person is \u201cexposed to disadvantageous terms or conditions of employment to which members of the other sex are not exposed.\u201d <em>Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Servs., Inc., </em>523 U.S. 75, 80, 118 S.Ct. 998, 140 L.Ed.2d 201 (1998) (quoting <em>Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc., </em>510 U.S. 17, 25, 114 S.Ct. 367, 126 L.Ed.2d 295 (1993) (Ginsburg, J., concurring)). As the Supreme Court has alternatively explained, an action constitutes sex discrimination under Title VII if \u201cthe evidence shows treatment of a person in a manner which <em>but for that person\u2019s sex </em>would be different.\u201d <em>City of Los Angeles, Dep\u2019t of Water &amp; Power v. Manhart, </em>435 U.S. 702, 711, 98 S.Ct. 1370, 55 L.Ed.2d 657 (1978) (emphasis added) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cWhatever evidentiary route the plaintiff chooses to follow, he or she must always prove that the conduct at issue was not merely tinged with offensive sexual connotations, but actually constituted \u2019discrimina[tion] ... because of ... sex,\u2019 \u201d <em>Oncale, </em>523 U.S. at 81, 118 S.Ct. 998 (emphasis omitted), and Title VII\u2019s prohibition \u201cmust extend to [discrimination] <em>of any kind </em>that meets the statutory requirements,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 80,118 S.Ct. 998 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">Sexual orientation discrimination meets this test. As the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\u201cEEOC\u201d) has observed, sexual orientation \u201ccannot be defined or understood without reference to sex,\u201d <em>Baldwin v. Foxx, </em>E.E.O.C. Decision No. 0120133080, 2015 WL 4397641, at *5 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>(July 16, 2015), because sexual orientation is defined by whether a person is attracted to people of the same sex or opposite sex (or both, or neither). For this reason, the EEOC has concluded that \u201c[s'Jexual orientation discrimination is sex discrimination because it necessarily entails treating an employee less favorably because of the employee\u2019s sex.\u201d <em>Id. </em>To illustrate, the EEOC gives an example:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-5\">[AJssume that an employer suspends a lesbian employee for displaying a photo of her female spouse on her desk, but does not suspend a male employee for displaying a photo of his female spouse on his desk. The lesbian employee in that example can allege that her employer took an adverse action against her that the employer would not have taken had she been male. That is a legitimate claim under Title VII that sex was unlawfully taken into account in the adverse employment action. The same result holds true if the person discriminated against is straight. Assume a woman is suspended because she has placed a picture of her husband on her desk but her gay colleague is not suspended after he places a picture of his husband on his desk. The straight female employee could bring a cognizable Title VII claim of disparate treatment because of sex.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-6\"><em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). Under this framework, \u201cbut for [the employee\u2019s] sex,\u201d the employee\u2019s treatment would have been different. <em>Manhart, </em>435 U.S. at 711, 98 S.Ct. 1370. Because this situation \u201cmeets the statutory requirements\u201d of Title VII, the statute \u201cmust extend\u201d to prohibit it. <em>Oncale, </em>523 U.S. at 80, 118 S.Ct. 998.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">One could argue in response that a man married to a man is not similarly situated to a man married to a woman, but is instead similarly situated to a woman married to a woman. In other words, one might contend that, for comparative purposes, a gay man is not married to a man; he is married to someone of the same sex, and it is other people married (or otherwise attracted) to the same sex who are similarly situated for the purpose of Title VII. In my view, this counterargument, which attempts to define \u201csimilarly situated\u201d at a different level of generality, fails to demonstrate that sexual orientation discrimination is not \u201cbut for\u201d sex discrimination. The Supreme Court rejected an analogous argument on interracial marriage\u2014 \u201cthat members of each race [were] punished to the same degree\u201d \u2014 in <em>Loving v. Virginia </em>and held that treating all members of interracial relationships the same, but less favorably than members of intrar-acial relationships, was a race-based classification violating the Equal Protection Clause. <em>See </em>388 U.S. 1, 7-8, 87 S.Ct. 1817, 18 L.Ed.2d 1010 (1967). The same logic suggests that it is sex discrimination to treat all individuals in same-sex relationships the same, but less favorably than individuals in opposite-sex relationships. Similarly, <em>Manhart </em>tells us that sex discrimination is treating someone \u201cin a manner which <em>but for </em>that person\u2019s sex would be different,\u201d 435 U.S. at 711, 98 S.Ct. 1370 (emphasis added) (internal quotation marks omitted), suggesting that when evaluating a comparator for a gay, lesbian, or bisexual plaintiff, we must hold every fact except the sex of the plaintiff constant \u2014 changing the sex of <em>both </em>the plaintiff and his or her partner would no longer be a \u201cbut-for-the-sex-of-the-plaintiff\u201d test.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-9\">Thus in my view, if gay, lesbian, or bisexual plaintiffs can show that \u201cbut for\u201d their sex, <em>Manhart, </em>435 U.S. at 711, 98 S.Ct. 1370, they would not have been discriminated against for being attracted to men (or being attracted to women), they have made out a cognizable sex discrimination claim. In such a case, then, traditional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>sex discrimination would encompass discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. Neither <em>Simonton </em>nor <em>Dawson </em>addressed this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">II. Sexual Orientation Discrimination As Associational Sex Discrimination</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">Next, sexual orientation discrimination is discrimination \u201cbecause of ... sex\u201d because it treats people differently due to the sex of their associates. The associational discrimination theory, which we articulated with respect to racial discrimination eight years after our decision in <em>Simonton, </em>provides that \u201can employer may violate Title YII if it takes action against an employee because'of the employee\u2019s association with a person of another race.\u201d <em>Holcomb v. Iona Coll., </em>521 F.3d 130, 138 (2d Cir. 2008). As we explained, \u201c[t]he reason [for this holding] is simple: where an employee is subjected to adverse action because an employer disapproves of interracial association, the employee suffers discrimination because of the employee\u2019s <em>own </em>race\u201d in relation to the race of his or her associate. <em>Id. </em>at 139 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">As the Supreme Court has observed, Title VII \u201con its face treats each of the enumerated categories exactly the same,\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and for that reason \u201cthe principles ... announee[d]\u201d with respect to sex discrimination \u201capply with equal force to discrimination based on race, religion, or national origin,\u201d and vice versa. <em>Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, </em>490 U.S. 228, 243 n.9, 109 S.Ct. 1775, 104 L.Ed.2d 268 (1989). Thus, the associational theory of race discrimination applies also to sex discrimination. Putting aside romantic associations, this principle is not controversial. If a white employee fired or subjected to a hostile work environment after friendly association with black coworkers has a claim under Title VII, <em>see Drake v. Minnesota Min. &amp; Mfg. Co., </em>134 F.3d 878, 881, 883-84 (7th Cir. 1998) (finding no categorical bar to the application of the associational theory of race discrimination to interracial friendships), then a female employee fired or subjected to a hostile work environment after friendly association with male coworkers should have a claim under Title VII. Once we accept this premise, it makes little sense to carve out same-sex relationships as an association to which these protections do not apply, particularly where, in the constitutional context, the Supreme Court has held that same-sex couples cannot be \u201clock[ed] ... out of a central institution of the Nation\u2019s society.\u201d <em>Obergefell v. Hodges, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 135 S.Ct. 2584, 2602, 192 L.Ed.2d 609 (2015); <em>see also United States v. Windsor</em>, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 133 S.Ct. 2675, 2693-94, 186 L.Ed.2d 808 (2013) (explaining that differentiation between opposite-sex and same-sex couples in the Defense of Marriage Act \u201cdemeans the couple, whose moral and sexual choices the Constitution protects, and whose relationship the State has sought to dignify\u201d (citation omitted)). In sum, if it is race discrimination to discriminate against interracial couples, it is sex discrimination to discriminate against same-sex couples.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-13\">Therefore, I conclude that if gay, lesbian, or bisexual plaintiffs can show that they would not have been discriminated against but for the sex of their associates, they have made out a cognizable sex discrimination claim. In such a case, the associational theory of sex discrimination would encompass discrimination on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>basis of sexual orientation. Because <em>Si-monton </em>and <em>Dawson </em>were decided before <em>Holcomb, </em>we have had no opportunity to address the associational theory of sex discrimination as applied to sexual orientation discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">III. Sexual Orientation Discrimination As Gender Stereotyping</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">Finally, sexual orientation discrimination is discrimination \u201cbecause of ... sex\u201d because such discrimination is inherently rooted in gender stereotypes. In <em>Back v. Hastings On Hudson Union Free Sch. Dist., </em>365 F.3d 107 (2d Cir. 2004), we considered \u201ca crucial question: What constitutes a gender-based stereotype?\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 119-20. While we did not definitively answer that question, we invoked the Seventh Circuit\u2019s observation that whether there has been improper \u201creliance upon stereotypical notions about how men and women should appear and behave\u201d can sometimes be resolved by \u201cconsidering] ... whether [the plaintiffs] gender would have been questioned for [engaging in the relevant activity] if he were a woman rather than a man.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 120 n.10 (quoting <em>Doe ex rel. Doe v. City of Belleville, Ill., </em>119 F.3d 563, 581-82 (7th Cir. 1997), <em>vacated on other grounds by </em>523 U.S. 1001, 118 S.Ct. 1183, 140 L.Ed.2d 313 (1998) (remanding the case in light of <em>Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Servs., Inc., </em>523 U.S. 75, 118 S.Ct. 998, 140 L.Ed.2d 201 (1998))).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">Relying on common sense and intuition rather than any \u201cspecial training,\u201d <em>see Back, </em>365 F.3d at 120 (quoting <em>Price Waterhouse, </em>490 U.S. at 256, 109 S.Ct. 1775), courts have explained that sexual orientation discrimination \u201cis often, if not always, motivated by a desire to enforce heterosexually defined gender norms. In fact, stereotypes about homosexuality are directly related to our stereotypes about the proper roles of men and women. ... The gender stereotype at work here is that \u2018real\u2019 men should date women, and not other men,\u201d <em>Centola v. Potter, </em>183 F.Supp.2d 403, 410 (D. Mass. 2002); <em>see also Boutillier v. Hartford Pub. Sch., </em>No. 3:13-CV-01303-WWE, 2016 WL 6818348 (D. Conn. Nov. 17, 2016) (\u201c[H]omosexuality is the ultimate gender non-conformity, the prototypical sex stereotyping animus.\u201d). Indeed, we recognized as much in <em>Dawson </em>when we observed that \u201c[stereotypical notions about how men and women should behave will often necessarily blur into ideas about heterosexuality and homosexuality.\u201d398 F.3d at 218 (alteration in original) (internal quotation marks omitted). Having conceded this, it is logically untenable for us to insist that this particular gender stereotype is outside of the gender stereotype discrimination prohibition articulated in <em>Price Waterhouse.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b231-9\">Numerous district courts throughout the country have also found this approach to gender stereotype claims unworkable. <em>See, e.g., Videckis v. Pepperdine Univ., </em>150 F.Supp.3d 1151, 1159 (C.D. Cal. 2015) (collecting cases) (\u201cSimply put, the line between sex discrimination and sexual orientation discrimination is \u2018difficult to draw' because that line does not exist, save as a fingering and faulty judicial construct.\u201d). The binary distinction that <em>Simonton </em>and <em>Dawson </em>establish between permissible gender stereotype discrimination claims and impermissible sexual orientation discrimination claims requires the factfinder, when evaluating adverse employment action taken against an effeminate gay man, to decide whether his perceived effeminacy or his sexual orientation was the true cause of his disparate treatment. <em>See Fabian v. Hosp. of Cent. Connecticut, </em>172 F.Supp.3d 509, 524 n.8 (D. Conn. 2016). This is likely to be an exceptionally difficult task in fight of the degree to which sexual orientation is commingled in the minds of many with particular traits asso-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>dated with gender. More fundamentally, carving out gender stereotypes related to sexual orientation ignores the fact that negative views of sexual orientation are often, if not always, rooted in the idea that men should be exclusively attracted to women and women should be exclusively attracted to men \u2014 as clear a gender stereotype as any.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">Thus, in my view, if gay, lesbian, or bisexual plaintiffs can show that they were discriminated against for failing to comply with some gender stereotype, including the stereotype that men should be exclusively attracted to women and women should be exclusively attracted to men, they have made out a cognizable sex discrimination claim. In such a case, the gender stereotype theory of discrimination would encompass discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. In neither <em>Simonton </em>nor <em>Dawson </em>did we consider this articulation of the gender stereotype at play in sexual orientation discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">IV. Congressional Inaction</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">Our decision in <em>Simonton </em>was understandably influenced by \u201cCongress\u2019s refusal to expand the reach of Title VII\u201d in the wake of \u201cconsistent judicial decisions refusing to interpret \u2018sex\u2019 to include sexual orientation,\u201d which we viewed as \u201cstrong evidence of congressional intent.\u201d 232 F.3d at 35. The Supreme Court has indicated, however, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-7\">[Subsequent legislative history is a hazardous basis for inferring the intent of an earlier Congress. It is a particularly dangerous ground on which to rest an interpretation of a prior statute when it concerns ... a proposal that does not become law. Congressional inaction lacks persuasive significance because several equally tenable inferences may be drawn from such inaction, including the inference that the existing legislation already incorporated the offered change.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"At1\"><em>Pension Ben. Guar. Corp. v. LTV Corp., </em>496 U.S. 633, 650, 110 S.Ct. 2668, 110 L.Ed.2d 579 (1990) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-9\">As several <em>amici </em>point out, there are idiosyncratic reasons that many bills do not become law, and those reasons may be wholly unrelated to the particular provision of a bill that a court is assessing. In light of the force of the arguments as to why discrimination \u201cbecause of ... sex\u201d encompasses sexual orientation discrimination and <em>Oncale\u2019 </em>s admonition that \u201cit is ultimately the provisions of our laws ... by which we are governed,\u201d 523 U.S. at 79, 118 S.Ct. 998, we should not rely on the \u201chazardous basis\u201d of subsequent congressional inaction, <em>LTV Corp., </em>496 U.S. at 650, 110 S.Ct. 2668, to exclude sexual orientation discrimination from Title VII\u2019s coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-10\">V. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b232-11\">When <em>Simonton </em>was decided, this Court reached the same conclusion as every other circuit court that had considered the issue: that discrimination \u201cbecause of ... sex\u201d did not encompass discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, a view then shared by the EEOC. But in the years since, the legal landscape has substantially changed, with the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Lawrence v. Texas, </em>539 U.S. 558, 123 S.Ct. 2472, 156 L.Ed.2d 508 (2003), and <em>Obergefell v. Hodges, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 135 S.Ct. 2584, 192 L.Ed.2d 609 (2015), affording greater legal protection to gay, lesbian, and bisexual individuals. During the same period, societal understanding of same-sex relationships has evolved considerably.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-14\">There is no doubt that sexual orientation discrimination \u201cwas assuredly not the principal evil Congress was concerned with when it enacted Title VII.\u201d <em>Oncale, </em>523 U.S. at 79, 118 S.Ct. 998. However, \u201cstatutory prohibitions often go beyond the prin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>cipal evil to cover reasonably comparable evils, and it is ultimately the provisions of our laws ... by which we are governed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Title VII prohibits all \u201cdiscrimination] ... because of ... sex\u201d and its protections \u201cmust extend to [discrimination] <em>of any kind </em>that meets the statutory requirements.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 80, 118 S.Ct. 998 (emphasis added). Despite recent congressional inaction in the face of judicial decisions excluding sexual orientation discrimination from Title VII\u2019s coverage, there is \u201cno justification in the statutory language ... for a categorical rule excluding\u201d such claims so long as a plaintiff can demonstrate that he or she was discriminated against \u201cbecause of ... sex.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">Taking a fresh look at existing cases, the EEOC and other advocates have articulated three ways that gay, lesbian, or bisexual plaintiffs could make this showing. First, plaintiffs could demonstrate that if they had engaged in identical conduct but been of the opposite sex] they would not have been discriminated against. Second, plaintiffs could demonstrate that they were discriminated against due to the sex of their associates. Finally, plaintiffs could demonstrate that they were discriminated against because they do not conform to some gender stereotype, including the stereotype that men should be exclusively attracted to women and women should be exclusively attracted to men. Neither <em>Simonton </em>nor <em>Dawson </em>had occasion to consider these worthy approaches. I respectfully think that in the context of an appropriate case our Court should consider reexamining the holding that sexual orientation discrimination claims are not cognizable under Title VII. Other federal courts are also grappling with this question, and it well may be that the Supreme Court will ultimately address it.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b230-7\">.
