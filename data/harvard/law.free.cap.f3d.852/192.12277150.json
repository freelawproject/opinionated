The issue before us is whether either the Fifth Amendment\u2019s due process clause or the Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment requires consideration and weighing of the \u2022 proportionality of removal against the grounds for removability. Because removal is not punitive and no fair notice considerations are present here, we hold that no such consideration is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-19\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b219-20\">In 2013, Marin-Marin, a native and citizen of Ecuador, entered the United States without inspection. At the time, he was an unaccompanied juvenile of 17 who had entered the country to live with his mother in Connecticut. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security charged that Marin-Marin was subject to removal based on his unlawful presence in the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-21\">Before an IJ, Marin-Marin, through counsel, conceded that he was removable as charged and declined to apply for relief from removal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Instead, Marin-Marin moved to terminate his removal proceedings, arguing that his removal would be disproportionate to the ground for his re-movability, and thus would constitute either excessive punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment or a grossly excessive penalty in violation of the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause. The IJ concluded that he did not have jurisdiction to consider Marin-Marin\u2019s constitutional arguments or conduct a proportionality analysis. The BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision without opinion. Marin-Marin has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>filed a timely petition for review of that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">Marin-Marin argues that the agency was required to conduct a proportionality analysis to determine whether his removal is excessive when compared to the noncriminal ground for his removal. We disagree and hold that there is no merit to Marin-Marin\u2019s claim that the agency is constitutionally required to consider whether removal is proportionate to the grounds for removability.</p>\n<p id=\"A2y6\">\u201cIt is settled that deportation, being a civil procedure, is not punishment and the cruel and unusual punishment clause of the Eighth Amendment accordingly is not applicable.\u201d <em>Santelises v. Immigration and Naturalization Serv., </em>491 F.2d 1254, 1255-56 (2d Cir. 1974); <em>see also Harisiades v. Shaughnessy, </em>342 U.S. 580, 594, 72 S.Ct. 512, 96 L.Ed. 586 (1952); <em>Sunday v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>832 F.3d 211, 218-19 (3d Cir. 2016); <em>Hinds v. Lynch, </em>790 F.3d 259, 264-68 (1st Cir. 2015). The Government here did not seek to remove Marin-Marin as a result of criminal conduct but rather based solely on his unauthorized presence in the United States. And, in general, when removal is predicated on a criminal act, \u201cthe alien is not being punished for that act (criminal charges may be available for that separate purpose) but is merely being held to the terms under which he was admitted.\u201d <em>Reno v. Am.-Arab Anti-Discrimination Comm., </em>525 U.S. 471, 491, 119 S.Ct. 936, 142 L.Ed.2d 940 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">Marin-Marin notes that in <em>Padilla v. Kentucky, </em>the Supreme Court stated that \u201cdeportation is a particularly severe penalty.\u201d 559 U.S. 356, 365, 130 S.Ct. 1473, 176 L.Ed.2d 284 (2010). However, \u201cthe Court\u2019s mere description of deportation as a \u2018penalty\u2019 ... does not call into question the continuing vitality of the Court\u2019s precedent holding that the Eighth Amendment is not implicated by a noncitizen\u2019s removal.\u201d <em>Hinds, </em>790 F.3d at 265. Indeed, in <em>Padilla, </em>the Court reiterated that deportation \u201cis not, in a strict sense, a criminal sanction,\u201d and held only that counsel must inform noncitizen criminal defendants of potential immigration consequences of a guilty plea. 559 U.S. at 365-66, 130 S.Ct. 1473; <em>cf. Chaidez v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 133 S.Ct. 1103, 1110-11, 185 L.Ed.2d 149 (2013) (characterizing <em>Padilla </em>as \u201cholding that the failure to advise about a <em>noncriminal </em>consequence could violate the Sixth Amendment\u201d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-11\">Relying on decisions like <em>State Farm Mutual Auto Ins. Co. v. Campbell, </em>538 U.S. 408, 123 S.Ct. 1513, 155 L.Ed.2d 585 (2003), Marin-Marin argues that proportionality review is required by the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause. But <em>State Farm, </em>and the decisions which preceded it, were predicated on problems of fair notice not present in this case, where removal following unauthorized entry is neither novel nor unexpected. <em>See id. </em>at 417, 123 S.Ct. 1513 (explaining that the reason procedural and substantive restrictions on punitive damage awards exist is because \u201celementary notions of fairness enshrined in our constitutional jurisprudence dictate that a person receive fair notice not only of the conduct that will subject him to punishment, but also of the severity of the penalty that a State may impose\u201d). As we have explained, \u201c[i]n immigration cases, the Due Process clause requires only that an alien receive notice and a fair hearing where the [Government] must prove by clear, unequivocal, and convincing evidence that an alien is subject to deportation.\u201d <em>Cervantes-Ascencio v. U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Serv., </em>326 F.3d 83, 86 (2d Cir. 2003). Given the clear statutory consequences of entry without inspection, the due process concerns that motivated the <em>State Farm </em>court are simply inapplicable in this case, and thus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>cannot mandate proportionality review. <em>See Herrerar-Molina v. Holder, </em>597 F.3d 128, 133-34 (2d Cir. 2010) (explaining, in the context of retroactivity analysis, that the application of clear immigration statutes does not implicate fair notice concerns).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">For the reasons stated, Marin-Marin\u2019s constitutional arguments fail. We need not further consider his argument that the IJ deprived him an opportunity to apply for relief from removal. Not only is this argument plainly belied by the record, but Marin-Marin failed to exhaust that argument before the BIA. <em>See Steevenez v. Gonzales, </em>476 F.3d 114, 117 (2d Cir. 2007); <em>see also Theodoropoulos v. Immigration and Naturalization Serv., </em>358 F.3d 162, 172 (2d Cir. 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b219-22\">.
