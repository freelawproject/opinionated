Because educators should strive to establish relationships of mutual trust and respect with then students, encouraging them to \u201cremain free to inquire, to study and to evaluate, to gain new maturity and understanding,\u201d Sweezy v. New Hampshire, 354 U.S. 284, 250, 77 S.Ct. 1203, 1 L.Ed.2d 1311 (1957) (plurality opinion), we abhor actions that \u201ccast a pall of orthodoxy over the classroom,\u201d Keyishian v. Bd. of Regents, 385 U.S. 589, 603, 87 S.Ct. 675, 17 L.Ed.2d 629 (1967). Nevertheless, our jurisprudence has long recognized that the \u201cfreedom to advocate unpopular and controversial views in schools and classrooms must be balanced against the society\u2019s countervailing interest in teaching students the boundaries of socially appropriate behavior.\u201d Bethel Sch. Dist. No. 403 v. Fraser, 478 U.S. 675, 681, 106 S.Ct. 3159, 92 L.Ed.2d 549 (1986). Federal courts \u201cdo not and cannot intervene in the resolution of conflicts which arise in the daily operation of school systems and which do not directly and sharply implicate basic constitutional values.\u201d Epperson v. Arkansas, 393 U.S. 97, 104, 89 S.Ct. 266, 21 L.Ed.2d 228 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b985-10\">Monica Pompeo, a student in a graduate-level course at the University of New Mexico (\u201cUNM\u201d), asks us to intercede in precisely such a dispute. She claims that UNM officials retaliated against her in violation of her free speech rights because they disagreed with viewpoints she expressed in an assigned class paper. We held in Axson-Flynn v. Johnson, 356 F.3d 1277 (10th Cir. 2004), that courts may not override an educator\u2019s decision in the school-sponsored speech context \u201cunless it is such a substantial departure from accepted academic norms as to demonstrate that the person or committee responsible did not actually exercise professional judgment\u201d and instead used \u201cthe proffered goal or methodology [as] a sham pretext for an impermissible ulterior motive.\u201d Id. at 1293 (quotation omitted). In that case, we held that a compelled speech requirement may have been imposed as \u201ca pretext for religious discrimination.\u201d Id. We are asked by Pompeo to draw an analogy between the religious discrimination at issue in Axson-Flynn and the viewpoint discrimination she brings to us. Yet our court has specifically held that precedent \u201callows educators to make viewpoint-based decisions about school-sponsored speech\u201d and may restrict speech they believe contains \u201cinflammatory and divisive statements.\u201d Fleming v. Jefferson Cty. Sch. Dist. R-1, 298 F.3d 918, 926, 934 (10th Cir. 2002). Exercising jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, for the reasons we elaborate herein, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"978\">*978</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b986-4\">In the Spring 2012 term, Pompeo enrolled in an upper-division course at UNM taught by Professor Caroline Hinkley titled \u201cImages of (Wo)men: From Icons to Iconoclasts.\u201d The course syllabus states that the class would cover a wide range of themes and that, because students will view sexually explicit material, the course is restricted. Students are advised that there is \u201ccontroversy built right into the syllabus\u201d and they should expect \u201cperhaps even incendiary class discussions.\u201d However, the syllabus further states that students will be expected to act \u201cwith respect and care for everybody\u2019s marvelously complex subjectivities,\u201d and that students who remain in the course agree \u201cto participate with such respect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b986-5\">As part of the course, students were required to complete response papers discussing the assigned material. The syllabus explains that \u201c[wjell-developed responses usually 1) refer to the reading, point to several passages, identify a page number; 2) offer a context or summary of what the author is saying; and then 3) pose a question.\u201d Hinkley\u2019s pedagogical goals for the course were to teach students how \u201cto write a critical and analytic paper,\u201d \u201cthink critically,\u201d and \u201cdiscern a critical argument from opinions and polemics.\u201d Hinkley emphasized to her students that she would \u201cask them to re-write their papers if they did not satisfy the requirements.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b986-6\">During her enrollment in the course, Pompeo submitted four response papers. She received an A- on her first paper and an A for her second and fourth papers. None of these papers included citations from the required readings.. Hinkley stated that she was \u201cvery lenient on many of the requirements\u201d in grading papers early in the semester in an effort to encourage students, but would \u201cbecome more emphatic about citations and [ ] critical authority\u201d as the term progressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-8\">Pompeo\u2019s third response paper, submitted on February 21, 2012, discussed the 1985 film Desert Hearts, which depicts a lesbian romance. In the paper, Pompeo states: \u201cFor those uninterested in lesbian romance, the film is likely intolerable to watch in its entirety because there is virtually no other theme in the film; providing no reason for anyone other than lesbians who are unable to discern bad film from good film to endure Desert Hearts.\u201d In response to an assigned article describing the women in the film as \u201cgorgeous,\u201d Pom-peo writes that \u201ctheir general appearance conjures the clich\u00e9, \u2018you can put lipstick on a pig, but it\u2019s still a pig.\u2019 \u201d She describes one of the characters as \u201cstill sexually vibrant, in spite of her perverse attraction to the same sex\u201d and states that \u201clesbianism is a very death-like state as far as its inability to reproduce naturally.\u201d Describing a scene in which two female characters share a bath, Pompeo writes that the \u201conly signs of potency in the form of the male cock exist in the emasculated body\u201d of one character\u2019s fianc\u00e9, and portrays the bath water as \u201cessentially drowning out any chance of life considering their fatal attraction to one another.\u201d Pompeo states that the film \u201ccan be viewed as entirely perverse in its desire and attempt to reverse the natural roles of man and woman in addition to championing the barren wombs of these women.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b986-9\">On March 6, 2012, Hinkley asked Pom-peo to meet with her to discuss the paper. Prior to their meeting, Hinkley returned the paper to Pompeo without a grade, but with several handwritten comments. For example, Hinkley wrote: \u201cOops, Monica \u2014 I can assure you that lesbians can discern a good film from a bad one just as any informed straight viewer,\u201d and \u201cWhy is attraction to the same sex perverse? This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"979\">*979</page-number>is a strong statement that needs critical backup. Otherwise it\u2019s just inflammatory.\u201d With respect to Pompeo\u2019s discussion of two female characters\u2019 \u201cfatal attraction to one another,\u201d Hinkley explained that one of the characters was straight. Hinkley also corrected several minor grammatical errors.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-5\">Pompeo met with Hinkley on March 20, 2012. Hinkley scheduled the meeting to discuss the ways in which she believed portions of the paper fell short of the standards applicable to critical analysis, specifically, Pompeo\u2019s \u201cunsupported generalizations about lesbians.\u201d She explained that \u201cinflammatory\u201d or \u201cpolemical\u201d statements in particular must be \u201cbacked up with critical, authoritative citations and sources.\u201d Hinkley felt that the paper merely stated opinions rather than critically stating and developing an argument, and that Pompeo was \u201ccritiquing lesbians,\u201d not the film. Rather than grade the paper poorly, Hinkley gave Pompeo an opportunity to rewrite it. After Pompeo stated that Desert Hearts was unendurable, Hinkley responded that the class would view other similar films that Pompeo would likely find unendurable as well. Toward the end of their meeting, Hinkley became \u201calarmed\u201d when Pompeo veered away from the subject at hand and shared details of her personal sexual history and preferences. She described the meeting as ending in a standstill. Hinkley was not sure whether Pompeo wanted to rewrite the paper.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-6\">Pompeo states that Hinkley was emotional during the meeting, accused Pompeo of using \u201chate speech,\u201d and said \u201cthat it was in [Pompeo\u2019s] best interest not to return to her class.\u201d However, Pompeo also avers that Hinkley suggested she write a paper on another film and indicated that she would probably receive a good grade. Pompeo characterized her \u201cstatus\u201d in the class following the meeting as \u201cunresolved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b987-8\">It is undisputed that Pompeo attended the next class, which occurred just after the meeting. Hinkley states that Pompeo was particularly disruptive in that class but had been disruptive throughout the semester. She states that Pompeo was generally domineering during classroom discussions, spoke out of turn, and interrupted other students. In the class after their meeting, Pompeo strayed from the course materials, engaging in a lengthy rant about Elizabeth Edwards and discussing Tony Curtis\u2019 sexuality. Concerned with the \u201cdisruptive situation,\u201d Hinkley asked Cinematic Arts Department Chair Susan Dever to visit the class, which she did. Pompeo asserts that she was made uncomfortable by Dever\u2019s presence and felt like she was being monitored because of the statements made in her paper.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-9\">The day after the March 20 meeting, Pompeo tried unsuccessfully to meet with Hinkley again. On March 22, Pompeo met with UNM Provost Jane Slaughter. The same day, Associate Dean Holly Barnet-Sanchez directed Pompeo to address her concerns to Dever. Pompeo met with Dever and Assistant Professor James Stone on March 23. At that meeting, Dever and Stone told Pompeo that her use of the words \u201cbarren\u201d and \u201ccock\u201d were not appropriate. Dever also conveyed to Pompeo that she had offended Hinkley. According to Dever, during this meeting Pompeo decided to complete the course as an independent study with Dever and was enthusiastic about her decision. But Pompeo states that through this series of meetings \u201cit was clear that I was banned from the Images class because of the perceived views and the language used in my paper.\u201d According to Pompeo, she wished to remain in the class, but \u201cunderstood that [she] would ... not be allowed back in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"980\">*980</page-number>Images classroom\u201d and had no choice but to complete the independent study.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-4\">In an email from Dever to Pompeo dated March 26, Dever wrote that she looked forward to completing an independent study program with Pompeo in lieu of the Images class. She stated: \u201cAs we agreed, given our thorough review of the ungraded paper, we\u2019ll chalk that up to a learning experience that will not feature in your final portfolio.\u201d Dever offered several pieces of writing advice, including that \u201c[plositing a thesis, rather than stating an opinion\u201d would strengthen Pompeo\u2019s work. She also thanked Pompeo for her \u201cwillingness to enter into these and other conversations with great openness on Friday.\u201d Finally, Dever stated in closing that Pom-peo had the right to speak with Barnet-Sanchez if she wished to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-5\">On March 29, Pompeo responded by email that she. would like to meet again and may want to speak with Barnet-San-chez. She wrote that she felt like she had \u201cdone something wrong\u201d and had \u201cbeen quietly removed from the classroom.\u201d Dever responded that she would be happy to talk and that Pompeo could visit with Bar-net-Sanchez if she preferred. Pompeo wrote back indicating that she would like to talk with Dever by phone and had decided what she wanted to do. Apparently after a phone conversation, Pompeo wrote to Dever, \u201cYou\u2019re too good at what you do. Thank you some more!\u201d The two scheduled another independent study meeting for April 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-6\">On April 6, Dever wrote to Pompeo to recap their meeting. As reflected in the email, Dever agreed during the meeting that Pompeo would revise and resubmit her Desert Hearts paper, rather than write on another topic. Dever believed that, in doing so, Pompeo had \u201cchosen the hardest road,\u201d but stated she would support Pompeo either way. She asked Pom-peo to submit a new draft by April 10 and advised her to keep in mind that she was writing for an academic audience. She suggested that Pompeo reconsider some word choices, including \u201cperverse,\u201d which \u201cis opinion and just muddies another point the essay seems to be making,\u201d and \u201cbarren,\u201d which \u201chas been used historically to punish and degrade women.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b988-8\">Pompeo responded that she would \u201cprobably use the word \u2018BARREN\u2019 \u201d and does not \u201clike to be told what words [she] may and may not use, ever.\u201d Dever replied that Pompeo could use whatever words she chose, \u201cbut after so much conversation about the word [barren], we know that ... choices have consequences.\u201d As to Pom-peo\u2019s statement that she did not like being told what words to use, Dever explained that she was \u201cin the business of trying to help students learn to write unassailable essays ... that speak to a general, academic audience with respect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b988-9\">Pompeo met with Barnet-Sanchez on April 9. Barnet-Sanchez told Pompeo that Hinkley and Dever thought she had been disruptive and disrespectful in class. Pom-peo denied that was true. She states that was the first time she was made aware of such a problem. Barnet-Sanchez proposed mediation, but that apparently did not occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-10\">Despite receiving several extensions, Pompeo never submitted a revised draft of her paper. Dever states that Pompeo eventually abandoned the independent study by failing to submit any essays or otherwise participate. Pompeo avers that she did not abandon the independent study. However, she also states that she \u201cfelt like [she] had no choice but to abandon the paper\u201d after meeting with Dever on March 23. Pompeo further indicates that she was unwilling to omit specific words from her paper, and that she understood the \u201cconsequences\u201d Dever threatened to be a poor grade or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"981\">*981</page-number>other academic or non-academic penalties. Pompeo admits that she ultimately withdrew from the course in part because she was unwilling to revise her paper. She also identifies the lack of a grade for her paper and dishonesty from Hinkley and Dever as reasons for her decision to withdraw.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-4\">Pompeo later filed a grievance with UNM. The school agreed to refund her tuition for the course. Pompeo then filed suit in state court against Hinkley, Dever, and the UNM Board of Regents. Defendants removed the case to federal court. In her amended complaint, Pompeo asserts a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claim against the defendants for violation of her First Amendment rights. She seeks a declaratory judgment and damages. The district court denied defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss, but later granted their motion for summary judgment. The district court concluded that Hinkley and Dever were entitled to qualified immunity and that the UNM Board of Regents was immune from suit under the Eleventh Amendment. Pom-peo timely appealed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b989-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b989-6\">We review the grant of summary judgment de novo. Hobbs ex rel. Hobbs v. Zenderman, 579 F.3d 1171, 1179 (10th Cir. 2009). A party is entitled to summary judgment only if, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b989-8\">To determine whether defendants are entitled to qualified immunity, a court must determine: (1) whether defendants\u2019 conduct violated plaintiffs constitutional rights; and (2) whether the right at issue was clearly established. Gomes v. Wood, 451 F.3d 1122, 1134 (10th Cir. 2006). We have discretion to consider either prong first. Panagoulakos v. Yazzie, 741 F.3d 1126, 1129 (10th Cir. 2013). We exercise that discretion to proceed directly to the clearly established prong.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-11\">For the law to be \u201cclearly established,\u201d there ordinarily must be a Supreme Court or Tenth Circuit opinion on point, or the clearly established weight of authority from other circuits must point in one direction. Medina v. City &amp; Cty. of Denver, 960 F.2d 1493, 1498 (10th Cir. 1992). \u201cThis is not to say that an official action is protected by qualified immunity unless the very action in question has previously been held unlawful, but it is to say that in the light of pre-existing law the unlawfulness must be apparent.\u201d Mimics, Inc. v. Vill. of Angel Fire, 394 F.3d 836, 842 (10th Cir. 2005) (quotation omitted). \u201cThe relevant, dispositive inquiry in determining whether a right is clearly established is whether it would be clear to a reasonable officer that his conduct was unlawful in the situation.\u201d Cortez v. McCauley, 478 F.3d 1108, 1114 (10th Cir. 2007) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b989-12\">In conducting our analysis, we must \u201cdefine the clearly established right at issue on the basis of the specific context of the case.\u201d Tolan v. Cotton, \u2014 U.S. \u2014 , 134 S.Ct. 1861, 1866, 188 L.Ed.2d 895 (2014) (per curiam) (quotations omitted). In other words, we are \u201cnot to define clearly established law at a high level of generality.\u201d Mullenix v. Luna, \u2014 U.S. -, 136 S.Ct. 305, 308, 193 L.Ed.2d 255 (2015) (per curiam). Instead, we must ask <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"982\">*982</page-number>\u201cwhether the violative nature of particular conduct is clearly established.\u201d Id. (quotation omitted). With the right at issue so formulated, \u201cexisting precedent must have placed the statutory or constitutional question beyond debate.\u201d Id. (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b990-4\">The Supreme Court has \u201cstressed that a court must judge the reasonableness of [an action] from the perspective and with the knowledge of the defendant.\u201d Kingsley v. Hendrickson, \u2014 U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 2466, 2474, 192 L.Ed.2d 416 (2015). However, the inquiry is an objective one: \u201ca court must assess whether the right was clearly established against a backdrop of the objective legal reasonableness of the actor\u2019s conduct.\u201d Gonzales v. Duran, 590 F.3d 855, 860 (10th Cir. 2009). \u201c[Subjective good faith or bad faith of government actors is ordinarily irrelevant to the objective inquiry whether a reasonable officer would have realized that his conduct was unlawful.\u201d Meyer v. Bd. of Cty. Comm\u2019rs, 482 F.3d 1232, 1242 (10th Cir. 2007). And \u201cdefendants\u2019 entitlement to qualified immunity[ ] turn[s] on an individual assessment of each defendant\u2019s conduct and culpability.\u201d Pahls v. Thomas, 718 F.3d 1210, 1233 (10th Cir. 2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b990-7\">It is well established that students do not \u201cshed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate.\u201d Tinker v. Des Moines Indep. Cmty. Sch. Dist., 393 U.S. 503, 506, 89 S.Ct. 733, 21 L.Ed.2d 731 (1969). However, students\u2019 free speech rights are not \u201ccoextensive with the rights of adults in other settings, and must be applied in light of the special characteristics of the school environment.\u201d Hazelwood Sch. Dist. v. Kuhlmeier, 484 U.S. 260, 266, 108 S.Ct. 562, 98 L.Ed.2d 592 (1988) (quotations and citation omitted). The parties agree that this case involves \u201cschool-sponsored speech,\u201d which is \u201cspeech that a school affirmatively promotes, as opposed to speech that it tolerates.\u201d Fleming 298 F.3d at 923 (quotations and alterations omitted). School-sponsored speech includes \u201cactivities [that] may fairly be characterized as part of the school curriculum.\u201d Hazelwood, 484 U.S. at 271, 108 S.Ct. 562.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-9\">\u201c[E]ducators do not offend the First Amendment by exercising editorial control over the style and content of student speech in school-sponsored expressive activities so long as their actions are reasonably related to legitimate pedagogical concerns.\u201d Id. at 273, 108 S.Ct. 562. We permit \u201cgreater control over\u201d school-sponsored speech \u201cto assure that participants learn whatever lessons the activity is designed to teach.\u201d Id. at 271, 108 S.Ct. 562. Educators may also limit speech that is \u201cungrammatical, poorly written, inadequately researched, biased or prejudiced, vulgar or profane, or unsuitable for immature audiences.\u201d Id. It is only when the decision to limit school-sponsored speech \u201chas no valid educational purpose that the First Amendment is so directly and sharply implicated as to require judicial intervention to protect students\u2019 constitutional rights.\u201d Id. at 273, 108 S.Ct. 562 (quotation, citation, and alteration omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b990-10\">Our court has held that \u201cHazelwood allows educators to make viewpoint-based decisions about school-sponsored speech.\u201d Fleming, 298 F.3d at 926. We reasoned that if school officials \u201cwere required to be viewpoint neutral,\u201d they \u201cwould be required to [publish speech] with inflammatory and divisive statements.\u201d Id. at 934; see also Fraser, 478 U.S. at 683, 106 S.Ct. 3159 (\u201cThe determination of what manner of speech in the classroom or in school assembly is inappropriate properly rests with the school board.\u201d). In the context of school-sponsored speech, we held that \u201cviewpoint neutrality is neither necessary nor appropriate, as the school is there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"983\">*983</page-number>responsible for determining the content of the education it provides.\u201d Fleming, 298 F.3d at 927 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b991-4\">We have also equated the question of whether speech is constitutionally protected with the question of whether a school official restricted that speech based on legitimate pedagogical concerns. See Vanderhurst v. Colo. Mountain Coll. Dist., 208 F.3d 908, 914 (10th Cir. 2000). That is, whether an action restricting a plaintiffs school-sponsored speech is \u201creasonably related to the [school\u2019s] legitimate pedagogical interests is the test for determining whether his speech fell within the ambit of First Amendment protection.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-6\">Pompeo relies heavily on Axson-Flynn as providing the clearly established law violated by defendants. In that case, an acting student at the University of Utah refused to use swear words in scene assignments. Axson-Flynn, 356 F.3d at 1282. Her professor told her she would have to \u201cget over\u201d her language concerns, and stated that she could \u201cstill be a good Mormon and say these words.\u201d Id. The professor initially threatened Axson-Flynn with a grade of zero if she refused to swear, but ultimately allowed her to omit language she found offensive from class exercises. Id. At an end of semester review, three college officials told her that her request for a language accommodation was unacceptable and that she should \u201ctalk to some other Mormon girls who are good Mormons, who don\u2019t have a problem with this.\u201d Id. The officials gave Axson-Flynn an ultimatum: \u201cYou can choose to continue in the program if you modify your values. If you don\u2019t, you can leave.\u201d M. The following semester, after the officials confirmed they would not change their minds, she left the program. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-7\">Our Axson-Flynn opinion discusses the standards governing school-sponsored speech claims at some length. We explained that \u201cschools must be empowered at times to restrict the speech of their students for pedagogical purposes,\u201d including \u201ca teacher\u2019s ability to penalize a student for disruptive classroom behavior.\u201d Id. at 1290. And \u201cschools also routinely require students to express a viewpoint that is not them own in order to teach the students to think critically.\u201d Id. Further:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Al17\">The school\u2019s methodology may not be necessary to the achievement of its goals and it may not even be the most effective means of teaching, but it can still be \u201creasonably related\u201d to pedagogical concerns. A more stringent standard would effectively give each student veto power over curricular requirements, subjecting the curricular decisions of teachers to the whims of what a particular student does or does not feel like learning on a given day.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b991-10\">Id. at 1292 (emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b991-11\">The Axson-Flynn opinion extensively quotes a Sixth Circuit decision, Settle v. Dickson County School Board, 53 F.3d 152 (6th Cir. 1995), in which a student sued after her teacher refused her permission to write a paper on the life of Jesus. The court explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b991-12\">teachers, like judges, must daily decide which arguments are relevant, which computations are correct, which analogies are good or bad, and when it is time to stop writing or talking. Grades must be given by teachers in the classroom, just as cases are decided in the courtroom; and to this end teachers, like judges, must direct the content of speech. Teachers may frequently make mistakes in grading and otherwise, just as we do sometimes in deciding cases, but it is the essence of the teacher\u2019s responsibility in the classroom to draw lines and make distinctions \u2014 in a word to encourage speech germane to the topic at hand and discourage speech unlike<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"984\">*984</page-number>ly to shed light on the subject. Teachers therefore must be given broad discretion to give grades and conduct class discussion based on the content of speech.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"azc-dedup-0\">Axson-Flynn, 356 F.3d at 1287 (quoting Settle, 53 F.3d at 155-56) (emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b992-4\">We also relied on a Ninth Circuit case, Brown v. Li, 308 F.3d 939 (9th Cir. 2002), in which a master\u2019s thesis committee refused to approve a thesis that contained a \u201cdisacknowledgements\u201d section offering \u201cspecial Fuck You\u2019s\u201d to a number of school officials. Id. at 943 (italics omitted). The student sued when officials withheld his degree until he submitted a thesis omitting the section. Id. at 945. We quoted the Ninth Circuit\u2019s holding that \u201cthe First Amendment does not require an educator to ... approve the work of a student that, in his or her judgment, fails to meet a legitimate academic standard.\u201d Axson-Flynn, 356 F.3d at 1288 (quoting Brown, 308 F.3d at 949) (emphasis omitted). The Ninth Circuit further held that the Hazel-wood standard applied with equal force at the secondary and college levels, noting that the \u201c[t]he Supreme Court\u2019s jurisprudence does not hold that an institution\u2019s interest in ... limiting a student\u2019s speech to that which is germane to a particular academic assignment diminishes as students age. Indeed, arguably the need for academic discipline and editorial rigor increases as a student\u2019s learning progresses.\u201d Brown, 308 F.3d at 951 (emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b992-5\">After citing these cases with approval, we held that \u201cthe Hazelwood framework is applicable in a university setting for speech that occurs in a classroom as part of a class curriculum.\u201d Axson-Flynn, 356 F.3d at 1289. We formulated the inquiry as whether the school\u2019s \u201cdecision was reasonably related to legitimate pedagogical concerns,\u201d giving \u201csubstantial deference to educators\u2019 stated pedagogical concerns.\u201d Id. at 1290 (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b992-7\">Although the pedagogical concern standard is highly deferential, we also held that \u201cwe would be abdicating our judicial duty if we failed to investigate whether the educational goal or pedagogical concern was pretextual.\u201d Id. at 1292-93 (emphasis omitted). Courts \u201cmay override an educator\u2019s judgment where the proffered goal or methodology was a sham pretext for an impermissible ulterior motive.\u201d Id. at 1293. \u201cSo long as the teacher limits speech or grades speech in the classroom in the name of learning and not as a pretext for punishing the student for her race, gender, economic class, religion or political persuasion, the federal courts should not interfere.\u201d Id. at 1293 (quoting Settle, 53 F.3d at 155-56). However, \u201cthe Supreme Court directed courts not to override a faculty member\u2019s professional judgment \u2018unless it is such a substantial departure from accepted academic norms as to demonstrate that the person or committee responsible did not actually exercise professional judgment.\u2019 \u201d Id. (quoting Regents of the Univ. of Mich. v. Ewing, 474 U.S. 214, 225, 106 S.Ct. 507, 88 L.Ed.2d 523 (1985)). The Axson-Flynn panel concluded that this stringent standard was met, and thus summary judgment was inappropriate because there was \u201ca genuine issue of material fact as to whether Defendants\u2019 justification for the script adherence requirement was truly pedagogical or whether it was a pretext for religious discrimination.\u201d Id. at 1293.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-8\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b992-9\">Pompeo contends that Axson-Flynn is directly on point. She argues that our case law is settled that \u201can instructor cannot restrict a student\u2019s speech based on the instructor\u2019s hostility to the viewpoint expressed in the speech\u201d and \u201cpretextual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"985\">*985</page-number>explanations for the \u2018legitimate\u2019 reason for the restriction of speech will not pass constitutional muster.\u201d We disagree that our prior opinion placed the \u201cconstitutional question beyond debate\u201d such that any reasonable official would have understood the conduct at issue in this case was impermissible. Luna, 136 S.Ct. at 308 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b993-4\">Pompeo\u2019s assertion that a college instructor may not restrict school-sponsored speech based on opposition to the viewpoint expressed in that speech is plainly incorrect. We have squarely held \u201cthat Ha-zelwood allows educators to make viewpoint-based decisions about school-sponsored speech.\u201d Fleming, 298 F.3d at 926. The Axson-Flynn opinion expressly notes this rule, 356 F.3d at 1291 (quoting Fleming, 298 F.3d at 926), along with Justice Souter\u2019s statement that university \u201cstudents are inevitably required to support the expression of personally offensive viewpoints in ways that cannot be thought constitutionally objectionable unless one is prepared to deny the University its choice over what to teach,\u201d id. (quoting Bd. of Regents v. Southworth, 529 U.S. 217, 242-43, 120 S.Ct. 1346, 146 L.Ed.2d 193 (2000) (Souter, J., concurring in the judgment)). Our circuit jurisprudence \u201centrusts to educators these decisions that require judgments based on viewpoint.\u201d Fleming, 298 F.3d at 928.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-10\">We held in Axson-Flynn that a court can overrule an educator\u2019s judgment only if \u201cthe proffered goal or methodology was a sham pretext for an impermissible ulterior motive,\u201d and that religious discrimination is one such impermissible motive. 356 F.3d at 1293. The only analysis offered in our opinion as to what else may constitute an \u201cimpermissible ulterior motive\u201d is a quote from a Sixth Circuit case listing \u201crace, gender, economic class, religion or political persuasion.\u201d Id. (quoting Settle, 53 F.3d at 155). Notably absent from that list is viewpoint discrimination, necessarily so in light of our holding in Fleming, 298 F.3d at 926.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, contrary to Pompeo\u2019s assertion, Axson-Flynn did not clearly establish that restrictions imposed on school-sponsored speech which are motivated by opposition to a student\u2019s viewpoint are necessarily impermissible. Accordingly, even if we were to accept Pompeo\u2019s claim that some of the explanations offered by Hinkley and Dever were intended as cover for then-belief that Pompeo\u2019s viewpoint was offen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"986\">*986</page-number>sive, clearly established law would not put defendants on notice that such conduct is unconstitutional.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b994-4\">This is not to say that viewpoint discrimination in educational settings is always desirable, or even fair. As the Supreme Court has noted, our \u201cNation\u2019s future depends upon leaders trained through wide exposure to that robust exchange of ideas which discovers truth out of a multitude of tongues, rather than through any kind of authoritative selection.\u201d Keyishian, 385 U.S. at 603, 87 S.Ct. 675 (quotation and alteration omitted). As a matter of policy, certain forms of viewpoint discrimination are undoubtedly contrary to this ideal. But in the context of school-sponsored speech, we have recognized that courts must \u201centrust[] to educators these decisions that require judgments based on viewpoint.\u201d Fleming, 298 F.3d at 928; see also Epperson, 393 U.S. at 104, 89 S.Ct. 266 (\u201cCourts do not and cannot intervene in the resolution of conflicts which arise in the daily operation of school systems and which do not directly and sharply implicate basic constitutional values.\u201d). Regardless of the competing policy goals that might be considered in assessing whether school-sponsored speech should be restricted, Axson-Flynn does not clearly prohibit educators from restricting school-sponsored speech based on viewpoints that they believe are offensive or inflammatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-7\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b994-8\">Pompeo also contends that defendants\u2019 actions were not reasonably related to legitimate pedagogical concerns. Her argument appears to be that because there is evidence that Hinkley and Dever were personally offended by Pompeo\u2019s position, the court necessarily cannot conclude that any proffered pedagogical motive for their actions is legitimate. This position requires us to consider whether the pedagogical concern inquiry is objective or subjective. As we explain, infra, our case law is unclear as to the correct approach. However, we need not decide the issue because Hinkley and Dever are entitled to qualified immunity under either standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-9\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b994-10\">As a general matter, the qualified immunity analysis looks to whether an official\u2019s conduct was objectively reasonable. Gonzales, 590 F.3d at 860. However, we may consider \u201cthe defendant\u2019s intent when his state of mind is an essential element of the plaintiffs substantive claim.\u201d Bruning v. Pixler, 949 F.2d 352, 356 (10th Cir. 1991). In some contexts, a defendant\u2019s subjective state of mind may be relevant to a First Amendment claim. See Howards v. McLaughlin, 634 F.3d 1131, 1143 (10th Cir. 2011) (\u201cEven if an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"987\">*987</page-number>official\u2019s action would be unexceptionable if taken on other grounds, when retaliation against Constitutionally-protected speech is the but-for cause of that action, this retaliation is actionable and subject to recovery.\u201d (quotations omitted)), rev\u2019d Reichle v. Howards, 566 U.S. 658, 132 S.Ct. 2088, 182 L.Ed.2d 985 (2012). But the rule stated in Howards, to the extent it remains viable, merely begs the question in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-4\">To state a First Amendment retaliation claim, a plaintiff must show that the defendant reacted to protected speech. Id. And in Vanderhurst, we held that the legitimate pedagogical interest inquiry determines whether speech is constitutionally protected. 208 F.3d at 914. We concluded that a college was \u201cincorrect to bifurcate as separate arguments (1) that Vanderhurst\u2019s speech was not constitutionally protected, and (2) that his termination was reasonably related to the College\u2019s legitimate pedagogical concerns.\u201d Id. Instead, we ruled that \u201cwhether Vander-hurst\u2019s termination reasonably related to the College\u2019s legitimate pedagogical interests is the test for determining whether his speech fell within the ambit of First Amendment protection.\u201d Id. We further stated that in assessing the asserted pedagogical interests, the question is not whether an action taken by school officials \u201cwas a reasonable one\u201d because \u201ca federal court should play no role in judging the reasonableness of the sanctions which a school levies.\u201d Id at 916 n.5. Instead, courts must ask whether the \u201cconduct prompting the sanction, as perceived in good faith by the school, in some way violated or vitiated ... legitimate pedagogical concerns.\u201d Id. Thus, under Van-derhurst, it appears a court must first conclude that a plaintiffs speech was constitutionally protected (in that actions restricting the speech were not related to pedagogical concerns) before considering whether a school official acted with subjective animus.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b995-7\">In light of this precedent, we agree with the district court that it is unclear if courts should ask whether a defendant\u2019s actions were subjectively retaliatory or whether the retaliatory actions were objectively unrelated to a pedagogical goal. Nevertheless, under either standard, we conclude that the actions taken by HinHey and Dever were sufficiently related to pedagogical goals that the claimed unconstitutional nature of their particular conduct was not clearly established. See Luna, 136 S.Ct. at 308.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-8\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b995-9\">\u201c[T]he \u2018pedagogical\u2019 concept set forth in Hazelwood merely means that the activity is related to learning\u201d and \u201cis by no means confined to the academic for it includes discipline, courtesy, and respect for authority.\u201d Corder v. Lewis Palmer Sch. Dist. No. 38, 566 F.3d 1219, 1228 (10th Cir. 2009) (quotations omitted). Several courts \u201chave established that the pedagogical test may be satisfied simply by the school district\u2019s desire to avoid controversy within a school environment.\u201d Id. at 1228-29 (quotation omitted); see also id. at 1232 (quoting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"988\">*988</page-number>out-of-circuit authority for the proposition that \u201c[i]t is well within the parameters of school officials\u2019 authority ... to teach civility and sensitivity in the expression of opinions\u201d (alterations in original)). And in Fleming, we held that a school may restrict school-sponsored speech \u201cwith inflammatory and divisive statements.\u201d 298 F.3d at 934. Similarly, the Supreme Court has held that \u201cschools, as instruments of the state, may determine that the essential lessons of civil, mature conduct cannot be conveyed in a school that tolerates lewd, indecent, or offensive speech.\u201d Fraser, 478 U.S. at 683, 106 S.Ct. 3159.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-4\">In considering defendants\u2019 entitlement to qualified immunity, we must look to their individual actions. See Pahls, 718 F.3d at 1233. Pompeo\u2019s complaints about Hinkley focus on their March 20, 2012, meeting. During that meeting, Hinkley chastised Pompeo for using inflammatory language, suggesting it could be considered hate speech, and asked Pompeo to rewrite her paper. Hinkley stated that it was in Pompeo\u2019s best interest not to return to class. But Pompeo does not claim to have been expelled from the class by Hinkley. Instead, she describes her status in the class as \u201cunresolved.\u201d It is undisputed that Pompeo attended class after the meeting and that Hinkley lacked the power to expel a student from class.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> After the meeting, Hinkley asked her superior, Dever, to attend class because she was concerned about Pompeo being disruptive and was unclear about how Pompeo wished to proceed with her Desert Hearts paper. Although Pompeo repeatedly refers to Hinkley\u2019s \u201crefusal\u201d to grade the paper, Pompeo does not claim that she actually requested a grade from Hinkley following their March 20 meeting. Hinkley states that she would have graded the paper if Pompeo requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-7\">From an objective standpoint, Hinkley\u2019s actions are related to legitimate pedagogical goals. Criticizing a student\u2019s paper, even in harsh terms, and asking her to rewrite it relate to the pedagogical goals of encouraging critical analysis, avoiding unsupported generalizations, and maintaining focus on assigned material rather than a student\u2019s general opinions. And requesting a superior attend class to assist with a potentially disruptive student cannot be deemed unreasonable.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> See Axson-Flynn, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"989\">*989</page-number>356 F.3d at 1290 (holding that teachers may restrict speech to \u201cpenalize a student for disruptive classroom behavior\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b997-4\">Even if the proper test considers a defendant\u2019s subjective state of mind, we conclude that Hinkley must be granted qualified immunity. Pompeo argues that the foregoing pedagogical goals were mere pretext, and that Hinkley actually engaged in these actions because she subjectively took offense to statements in Pompeo\u2019s paper. But as discussed supra, clearly established law does not prohibit a school official from restricting statements the educator finds \u201cinflammatory and divisive\u201d in school-sponsored speech. Fleming, 298 F.3d at 934. At the very least, Hinkley\u2019s actions are reasonably related to her subjective conclusion that Pompeo\u2019s statements were inflammatory. See id. at 933 (declining to consider one proffered pedagogical interest because second interest was valid). Teaching students to avoid inflammatory language when writing for an academic audience qualifies as a legitimate pedagogical goal. Corder, 566 F.3d at 1228 (pedagogical concerns include \u201cdiscipline, courtesy, and respect for authority\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b997-5\">We reach the same conclusion as to Dever. Pompeo claims that Dever scolded her at the March 23 meeting, telling her that use of the word \u201cbarren\u201d was offensive, and that Dever conveyed to Pompeo that she was \u201ca disgrace.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Pom-peo further contends that Dever threatened her with consequences, which she took to mean a poor grade, if she persisted in using the word \u201cbarren\u201d in a revised paper. The email exchange in which Dever makes this comment is included in the record. Following Pompeo\u2019s statement that she will likely use the term \u201cbarren,\u201d Dever states that the term \u201chas been used historically to punish and degrade women.\u201d And in response to Pompeo\u2019s statement that she did not \u201clike to be told what words I may and may not use, ever,\u201d Dever explains that her role is to teach students to write essays \u201cthat speak to a general, academic audience with respect.\u201d She states that word choice is ultimately up to Pompeo, but that her \u201cchoices have consequences.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b997-10\">As with Hinkley, even if we conduct a subjective inquiry, we conclude that Dever is entitled to qualified immunity. Dever\u2019s challenged actions are reasonably related to the legitimate pedagogical goal of deterring students from using words in a class assignment that the teacher subjectively finds inappropriate. See Axson-Flynn, 356 F.3d at 1292 (\u201cThe school\u2019s methodology may not be necessary to the achievement of its goals and it may not even be the most effective means of teaching, but it can still be \u2018reasonably related\u2019 to pedagogical concerns.\u201d (emphasis omitted)). Our case law does not suggest that federal courts are in the business of determining whether a term is actually inappropriate for an academic audience, to the extent appropriateness can be objectively defined. Short of turning every classroom into a courtroom, we must \u201centrust[] to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"990\">*990</page-number>educators these decisions that require judgments based on viewpoint.\u201d See Fleming, 298 F.3d at 928.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b998-5\">In assessing defendants\u2019 claims of qualified immunity, we are mindful of the Supreme Court\u2019s admonition to \u201cdefine the clearly established right at issue on the basis of the specific context of the case.\u201d Tolan, 134 S.Ct. at 1866 (quotations omitted). Pompeo claims a right to use language in a course assignment that her professors found to be inflammatory without being criticized or pressured to make revisions. Because we conclude that such a right is not clearly established, the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of defendants is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b989-9\">. Pompeo does not address the district court's dismissal of her claim against the UNM Board of Regents in her briefing and has thus waived that claim. See Adler v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 144 F.3d 664, 679 (10th Cir. 1998) (\u201cArguments inadequately briefed in the opening brief are waived.... \u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b993-6\">. Although Pompeo does not argue that defendants were motivated by any of the potentially impermissible factors explicitly identified in this list, we recognize that Pompeo's viewpoint concerns a politically charged topic. However, we do not read Settle's reference to \"political persuasion,\u201d 53 F.3d at 155, as prohibiting viewpoint discrimination with respect to opinions that cross some threshold of political salience. Instead, it seems that the Sixth Circuit was referring to discrimination based on partisan affiliation. See generally Keyishian, 385 U.S. at 596, 603-10, 87 S.Ct. 675 (holding unconstitutional a requirement that college professors sign a pledge indicating they are not members of the Communist Party).</p>\n<p id=\"b993-7\">We highly doubt that a test based on the degree of a viewpoint\u2019s political prominence could be practicable. And in Fleming, we specifically stated that schools retain discretion to bar \"inflammatory and divisive statements\u201d in school-sponsored speech. 298 F.3d at 934. Courts are in poor position to second guess every teacher\u2019s conclusion that speech used in an assignment was inflammatory rather than merely controversial, or that a student was disruptive rather than simply passionate. Even when a school official errs in making these determinations, our case law does not clearly indicate that a First Amendment violation has occurred. See Axson-Flynn, 356 F.3d at 1287 (\"Teachers may frequently make mistakes in grading and otherwise, just as we do sometimes in deciding cases, but it is the essence of the teacher\u2019s responsibility in the classroom to draw lines and make distinctions .... \u201d (quoting Settle, 53 F.3d at 155-56) (emphasis omitted)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b994-5\">. Pompeo suggests that the district court erred by distinguishing Axson-Flynn on the ground that the case concerned religious discrimination. We explained there that \"[t]he religious nature of Axson-Flynn's refusal to say the offensive words is not determinative of our disposition of her free speech claim\u201d because the \"Supreme Court has never held that religious speech is entitled to more protection than nonreligious speech.\u201d Axson-Flynn, 356 F.3d at 1292 n.13 (emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b994-6\">But the religious element of Axson-Flynn is nevertheless important. The plaintiff in that case prevailed on appeal because we concluded a material dispute existed as to whether the defendants' attempt to compel her to speak objectionable phrases \"was truly pedagogical or whether it was a pretext for religious discrimination.\u201d Id. at 1293. Thus, even though the plaintiff's religious motivation for objecting to the compelled speech was irrelevant, the defendants' potential hostility to the plaintiff's religion was key. Pompeo attempts to analogize hostility to her viewpoint to the religious discrimination claimed in Axson-Flynn, but that analogy fails because educators are not prohibited from engaging in viewpoint discrimination under Fleming.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b995-5\">. Pompeo concedes that Vanderhurst appeared to apply an objective standard but argues its analysis should be limited to the context of school employment decisions. Although that case did consider an action taken by a college in response to a professor's speech, nothing in our case law suggests Van-derhurst is so limited. At the very least, a reasonable official could not be certain that the test stated in Vanderhurst applied only in the employment context. See generally Reichle, 132 S.Ct. at 2096 (granting qualified immunity because \u201cit was at least arguable that [a rule governing retaliatory prosecution] extended to retaliatory arrests\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b996-5\">. Pompeo states that ''[cQuring the meetings ... on March 20th, 22nd and 23rd, it was clear that I was banned from the Images class because of the perceived views and the language used in my paper.\u201d But she does not identify who made clear to her that she was \u201cbanned\u201d or what was said to give her this impression. We have previously explained that \u00a7 1983 plaintiffs must \u201cmake clear exactly who is alleged to have done what to whom, to provide each individual with fair notice as to the basis of the claims against him or her, as distinguished from collective allegations against the state.\u201d Robbins v.

Pom-peo states that she understood the class syllabus to \u201callow passionate debate\u201d and \"controversy.\u201d Whether she viewed her passionate class commentary as disruptive does not tell us whether Hinkley did so.
