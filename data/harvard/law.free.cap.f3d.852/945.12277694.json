The district court denied his application without prejudice. Bundy filed an emergency petition with us for a writ of mandamus to force the district court to admit Klayman. We declined to do so in October 2016. <em>See In re Bundy, </em>840 F.3d 1034 (9th Cir. 2016). We wrote then:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b955-17\">Under our decisions, the district court had more than ample cause to turn down Klayman\u2019s application: he is involved in an ethics proceeding before the District of Columbia Bar, and he was not candid with the court about the status of those proceedings; he disclosed that he was twice barred <em>in perpetuity </em>from appearing <em>pro hac vice </em>before judges in the Central District of California and the Southern District of New York, but he failed to list numerous cases \u2014 all available on We'stlaw or LEXIS \u2014 in which he has been reprimanded, denied <em>pro hac vice </em>status, or otherwise sanctioned for violating various local rules; and he has a record of going after judges personally, and shortly after Chief Judge Gloria Navarro denied his application, Bundy filed a frivolous <em>Bivens </em>action against her in her own court. This litany of reasons for denying Klayman <em>pro hac vice </em>status demonstrates that the district court did not abuse its discretion, much less commit clear error.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b955-18\"><em>Id. </em>at 1036. Bundy petitioned for <em>en banc </em>review, but his petition was denied on December 13, 2016. Bundy then petitioned the Supreme Court for a writ of mandamus, but that petition, too, was denied on February 27, 2017. <em>In re Bundy, </em>No. 16-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"948\">*948</page-number>908, \u2014 U.S. -, 137 S.Ct. 1213, 197 L.Ed.2d 259, 2017 WL 237570 (2017) (mem.).</p>\n<p id=\"AL-e\">Barely a' week later, Bundy, through Klayman, filed the instant emergency petition for a writ of mandamus. Bundy cites to \u201cfundamentally changed circumstances that underscore [his] compelling need to have a full legal defense team, including Klayman, ready and able to represent him at trial.\u201d Emergency Pet. for Writ of Mandamus at 6-7, Mar. 9, 2017, ECF No. 1 [hereinafter Petition]. The petition is procedurally irregular in a number of respects. First, Klayman purports to be representing Bundy in his request for a writ of mandamus. Bundy has counsel of record, Nevada attorney Bret 0. Whipple. Whipple, however, did not sign the motion, file an affidavit, or otherwise join in any way Bundy\u2019s latest motion. Indeed, Bundy, in his reply filed on March 23, explains that his current attorney refused to file a new <em>pro hac vice </em>application on behalf of Klayman because Whipple did not want to \u201ctarnish his reputation.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. in Reply to Hon. Gloria Navarro\u2019s Answer and Real Party in Interest\u2019s Answer at 11, Mar. 23, 2017, ECF No. 8 [hereinafter Reply]. We have no affidavit or other evidence that Bundy authorized Klayman to file this motion or still wants Klayman to join his defense team. Nevertheless, Klay-man, purporting to represent Bundy, represents that \u201cMr. Klayman had no other recourse but to file [the] instant Emergency Petition for Writ of Mandamus.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Mr. Klayman\u2019s \u201crecourse\u201d is his own affair; it is not clear that he represents Bundy in anything he has presented to us. Why Bundy (or Klayman) thinks that Whipple had to file a <em>pro hac vice </em>application on behalf of Klayman, but that Klayman could file a petition for a writ of mandamus on behalf of Bundy, we do not understand.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-6\">The motion is irregular for a second reason. It is not clear what Bundy wants us to do, so it is not clear what standards we must apply to the request. If Bundy is asking us to reconsider our prior decision, the request is late. We have already denied Bundy\u2019s petition for rehearing <em>en banc, </em>and the Supreme Court has denied certiorari. If, as Bundy claims, there are \u201cfundamentally changed circumstances,\u201d then Klayman\u2019s renewed request for admission <em>pro hac vice </em>should have been addressed to the district court in the first instance. It was not, which means \u2014 we think \u2014 that Bundy or' Klayman is asking this court to issue a writ of mandamus to the district court for its failure <em>sua sponte </em>to admit Klayman <em>pro hac vice. </em>So construing Bundy\u2019s motion, and because the district court and government filed answers to the petition, we will proceed to the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b956-8\">There are no merits. The standards by which we approach a petition for a writ of mandamus to direct a district court to admit an out-of-state attorney <em>pro hac vice </em>have not changed since October:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A4WM\">Mandamus \u201cis a \u2018drastic and extraordinary\u2019 remedy \u2018reserved for really extraordinary causes.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cheney v.

Sec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"949\">*949</page-number>ond, the petitioner must show that \u201c[his] right to issuance of the writ is \u2018clear and indisputable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 381, 124 S.Ct. 2576 (alteration in original) (quoting <em>Kerr, </em>426 U.S. at 403, 96 S.Ct. 2119). \u201cThird, even if the first two prerequisites have been met, the issuing court, in the exercise of its discretion, must be satisfied that the writ is appropriate under the circumstances.\u201d <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b957-5\"><em>In re Bundy, </em>840 F.3d at 1040 (alterations in original). We further explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b957-6\">Because, on direct appeal, we \u201cnormally review a denial of a motion to appear <em>pro hac vice </em>for abuse of discretion,\u201d <em>United States v. Walters, </em>309 F.3d 589, 591 (9th Cir. 2002), our review in mandamus proceedings is \u201cespecially deferential,\u201d <em>In re United States, </em>[791 F.3d 945, 955 (9th Cir. 2016)]. On petition for a writ of mandamus, we look to see if the district court abused its discretion in a manner so obvious that the error is \u201cclear\u201d to all.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b957-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 1041.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b957-9\">We hold that the district court\u2019s failure <em>sua sponte </em>to grant Klayman <em>pro hac vice </em>status as of March 2017 was neither an abuse of discretion nor clear error. Bundy raises three claims of \u201cchanged circumstances\u201d: (1) the district court\u2019s refusal to dismiss all charges against Bundy in light of the issuance of a report that may cast doubt on the credibility of one of the government\u2019s potential witnesses; (2) a hearing at which defense counsel agreed to strike the district court\u2019s husband, Brian Rutledge, who is a deputy district attorney in Clark County, from its potential witness list; and (3) the lack of federal criminal experience of Bundy\u2019s current counsel of choice, Bret Whipple. The circumstances cited by Bundy have nothing but the most attenuated connections with the denial of Klayman\u2019s <em>pro hac vice </em>application. And none of them come close to demonstrating that the \u201cdistrict court abused its discretion in a manner so obvious that the error is \u2018clear\u2019 to all.\u201d <em>In re Bundy, </em>840 F.3d at 1041. This is particularly so when Bundy failed to present his case for \u201cchanged circumstances\u201d to the district court in the first place. We will address each \u201ccircumstance\u201d in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-11\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b957-12\">First, Bundy complains that alleged prosecutorial misconduct occurred when the government did not promptly turn over a report on ethical misconduct by a Bureau of Land Management (BLM) official who may or may not testify for the government. The misconduct was related to an event at the Burning Man Festival in Northern Nevada, and does not involve Bundy. <em>See </em>Office of Inspector Gen., U.S. Dep\u2019t of the Interior, <em>Investigative Report of Ethical Violations and Misconduct of Bureau of Land Management Officials </em>(2017) https://www.doioig.gov/sites/doioig. gov/files/EthcialViolationsAndMisconduct ByBLMOffieials_Public.pdf. Bundy argues that the district court should have dismissed the charges against Bundy, and further alleges that earlier disclosure of the report would at least have allowed Bundy and his co-defendants \u201cto conduct a meaningful investigation, move for discovery, and effectively impeach the credibility of [the official].\u201d Reply at 4. At first blush, it is unclear how this possibly constitutes a changed circumstance related to Klay-man\u2019s <em>pro hac vice </em>admission and the district court\u2019s determination (as well as our own) that Klayman\u2019s admission would be a substantial impediment to the \u201cethical and orderly administration of justice.\u201d <em>In re Bundy, </em>840 F.3d at 1042 (quoting <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"950\">*950</page-number><em>States v. Ries, </em>100 F.3d 1469, 1471 (9th Cir. 1996)).</p>\n<p id=\"b958-4\">Bundy, likely recognizing this logical gap, claims that only if Klayman is immediately recognized as counsel will Bundy\u2019s ability to respond properly to this late-disclosed report be constitutionally adequate. Bundy further argues that, by not dismissing the action entirely as a result of the allegedly-late-disclosed report, the district court erred. <em>See </em>Petition at 8. In fact, he claims this is but one in a seemingly never-ending series of \u201cseverely prejudicial ruling[s]\u201d by the district court. <em>Id. </em>at 9; Reply at 4. Bundy asserts that only Klayman will be able to properly fight these prejudicial rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-5\">Bundy\u2019s claim of district court error in refusing to dismiss the charges on the basis of the report is not, absent clear error, remediable at this stage of the proceedings through mandamus. <em>See DeGeorge v. U.S. Dist. Court, </em>219 F.3d 930, 935 (9th Cir. 2000) (\u201c[Djirect appeal after trial, as opposed to immediate review, is the typically adequate means of review.\u201d). There will be ample opportunity for Bundy to renew his claim before the district court in advance of trial. He may preserve his argument by raising his claim again at trial, which is not scheduled until April, at the earliest. And, failing that, Bundy may appeal to this court. Similarly, Bundy is free to argue that the report may be used to impeach the BLM official at trial, if he testifies. It is premature for us to grant mandamus at this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b958-7\">Bundy further complains about the manner by which the district court struck the district court judge\u2019s husband (Rutledge) from Bundy\u2019s proposed witness list. Upon seeing Rutledge on Bundy\u2019s witness list, the district court held an <em>ex parte </em>hearing in which Bundy and three of his co-defendants were ordered to \u201cproduce an offer of proof that complies with Federal Rule of Evidence 602 regarding their listing of the husband of the presiding judge as a witness\u201d on their witness lists. Minute Order in Chambers, <em>United States v. Bundy, </em>No. 2:16-cr-00046-GMN-PAL-1 (D. Nev. Mar. 8, 2017), ECF No. 1691; <em>see </em>Fed. R. Evid. 602 (requiring a witness to have personal knowledge). Bundy characterizes the district court\u2019s issuance of this show-cause order as \u201cthreatening to hold Whipple in contempt\u201d and as an \u201cattempt to neutralize anyone who even attempts to represent [Bundy].\u201d Petition at 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-9\">As evidence, Bundy states that Ms. Bundy said that Whipple told her that the district court, at the <em>ex parte </em>hearing, told Whipple that he would'be sanctioned unless he agreed to withdraw Rutledge. The district court informs us that it never threatened Whipple with contempt. District Ct. Judge Navarro\u2019s Answer at 2, Mar. 21, 2017, ECF No. 7 [hereinafter Dist. Ct. Answer]. (And the sealed brief filed by Whipple in response to the district court\u2019s show-cause order where Whipple effectively concedes removing the name calls into question the veracity of Bundy\u2019s double-hearsay evidence and supports the district court\u2019s recollection of events.) Bun-dy had wanted to call Rutledge because he worked in the district attorney\u2019s office and the Bundys had asked the district attorney\u2019s office to investigate what they claimed were abuses by federal agents. Petition at 17. When Whipple admitted that he could not satisfy Rule 602 for Rutledge and had no good faith basis for leaving the name on the list, the district court struck Rutledge\u2019s name from the witness list. Dist. Ct. Answer at 3-4. Complaints about properly enforcing the rules of evidence are not the proper subjects of petitions for writs of mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-10\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b958-11\">Bundy\u2019s real complaint \u2014 or, at least, Klayman\u2019s complaint \u2014 is that these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"951\">*951</page-number>adverse rulings, combined with other factors, demonstrate that Whipple is not able to defend Bundy adequately. Bundy claims that Whipple is not fully prepared to defend Bundy because \u201cWhipple has no federal criminal defense experience.\u201d Petition at 9. He adds, \u201cKlayman has extensive experience in complex, contentious federal criminal defense, and Petitioner\u2019s local counsel, [Whipple], has none.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 10; <em>see also id. </em>at 14 (\u201cKlayman ... has federal criminal defense experience.... \u201d); <em>id. </em>at 17 (\u201cKlayman [is] the only defense counsel with federal criminal experience that [Bun-dy] has been able to find.... \u201d); <em>id. </em>Ex. I \u00b6 9 (Bundy Aff.) (\u201c[Whipple] does not have comparable experience to Larry Klayman who is a former federal prosecutor in any event.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b959-5\">The assertions made by Bundy about his counsel are demonstrably false. Either Klayman has failed to ascertain the facts by, for example, talking with Whipple or looking at Whipple\u2019s website, or he has deliberately misled this court. Neither option paints Klayman in a good light. At best, Klayman has shown such a casual acquaintance with the facts that he is guilty of at least gross negligence in his representations to this court. As both the government and the district court point out to this court in their responses to Bundy\u2019s petition, Whipple is well qualified to serve as Bundy\u2019s counsel. Dist. Ct. Answer at 4; Answer from the United States at 13, Mar. 20, 2017, ECF No. 6. Whipple has been a member of the Nevada Bar for more than twenty years. For six years, he was a public defender in Clark County, including three years in the Special Public Defender\u2019s Office, which has responsibility for capital cases in Nevada state courts. The district court verified that Whipple, now in private practice, has extensive experience in federal criminal cases. For some thirteen years, Whipple has accepted federal appointment under the Criminal Justice Act, where he has defended some 99 criminal cases, including complex, multi-defendant cases. At least\" one of his recent cases was the subject of a high-profile, multi-defendant, fourteen-day trial. Dist. Ct. Answer at 4.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b959-8\">Confronted with these facts, Bundy shifted his argument in his reply. First, Klayman now candidly admits in an affidavit that he \u201cdid not check Mr. Whipple\u2019s PACER history prior to preparing the Emergency Petition for Writ of Mandamus.\u201d Reply at 7. (PACER is our public, electronic database, which would have informed Klayman of Whipple\u2019s substantial federal criminal experience.) Klayman offered no explanation for missing Whipple\u2019s six years as a public defender. According to Klayman\u2019s affidavit, he now \u201cbelieves that Mr. Whipple is a highly competent attorney,\u201d but that \u201cMr. Whipple, <em>on his own, </em>does not have the necessary federal criminal defense experience or the resources to mount a zealous and effect [sic] defense.\u201d <em>Id.; id. </em>Ex. C \u00b6\u00b6 11-12, 16 (Klay-man Aff.).</p>\n<p id=\"b959-9\">By contrast, although Klayman repeatedly assures us that he has \u201cextensive experience in complex, contentious criminal defense,\u201d he has provided us no evidence in support. Not a single example. As we noted in our prior opinion, we are well <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>aware of Klayman\u2019s substantial experience in federal and state courts, but from what we can tell, it is almost entirely civil in nature. <em>See, e.g., In re Bundy, </em>840 F.3d at 1045-46. Klayman claims that he is a \u201cformer prosecutor with the U.S. Department of Justice.\u201d Klayman Aff. \u00b6 3. But the only example he identifies by name is <em>United States v. AT&amp;T, </em>where he was \u201can instrumental part of the team that helped break up AT&amp;T.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The AT&amp;T litigation was, of course, an enormously complex case brought by the Antitrust Division, but it was a civil, not a criminal, case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See, e.g., United States v. AT&amp;T, 552 </em>F.Supp. 131 (D.D.C. 1982). It may well be that Klay-man has extensive criminal trial experience, and perhaps even federal criminal trial experience, but we cannot verify this from anything Klayman has provided us.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-4\">Even if the record would support Klay-man\u2019s claim to have extensive criminal defense experience, that would not be sufficient to warrant the issuance of a writ of mandamus. As we explained in our prior decision, Bundy has not offered any explanation for why, if he needs additional counsel, he cannot secure the services of attorneys in Nevada or out-of-state attorneys who can satisfy Nevada\u2019s <em>pro hac vice </em>rules. <em>See In re Bundy, </em>840 F.3d at 1048 (\u201c[W]e do not\" have an affidavit from anyone \u2014 Bundy, Klayman, [Bundy\u2019s former attorney], or anyone else \u2014 telling us of unsuccessful efforts to find counsel.\u201d). Bundy offers no case for why Klayman is the only attorney who can help him or why Nevada must bend its <em>pro hac vice </em>rules to accommodate him in the courtroom.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b960-9\">Even if the district court\u2019s sole obligation while considering whether to grant <em>pro hac vice </em>admission to an attorney was to maximize the defendant\u2019s chances of receiving the best trial outcome, the district court would not have abused its discretion or clearly erred in finding that Whipple could handle Bundy\u2019s case. But that is not the district court\u2019s sole obligation. Instead, as we discussed in <em>In re Bundy, </em>district courts have other legitimate policy considerations that bear on a <em>pro hac vice </em>admission decision, such as the ethical practice of the law and the orderly administration of justice. <em>See id. </em>at 1041-42.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> And evaluating the decision to deny Klayman <em>pro hac vice </em>status against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"953\">*953</page-number>the backdrop of these competing interests, the documents filed with this court in support of the petition for a writ of mandamus \u2014 by themselves and without looking to our earlier decision\u2019s consideration of Klayman\u2019s record \u2014 entirely support the district court\u2019s decision. The petition and reply contain patently false assertions and lack the most basic of due diligence in fact checking.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-4\">The district court did not err, much less \u201cclearly err\u201d when it failed <em>sua sponte </em>to admit Klayman <em>pro hac vice. </em>Future motions from Bundy must be filed by counsel of record. Future filings from Klayman personally should be accompanied by either an affidavit from counsel of record or Bundy in support of the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-5\">The petition for a writ of mandamus is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b959-6\">. This court had little difficulty confirming most of these facts from Whipple\u2019s website, his Linkedln account, and PACER. <em>See Bret Whipple, </em>Linkedln, https://www.linkedin.com/ in/bret-whipple-67441117 (last visited Mar. 30, 2017); <em>Las Vegas Nevada Attorney Bret Whipple, </em>Just. L. Ctr., http://mylasvegas lawyer.com/las-vegas-nevada-attomey-bret-whipple (last visited Mar. 30, 2017). That Klayman, evidently, failed to use the most primitive modern tools to verify his serious accusations that counsel of record was not qualified is inexcusable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b960-5\">. We have also consulted Klayman\u2019s own website.

We do not understand the dissent to support Klayman's reckless claims against Whipple. We understand our dissenting colleague to maintain the position he took in the initial action \u2014 that Bundy has a Sixth Amendment right to counsel of his own choosing.

Lest there be any doubt, we agree with the dissent that a defendant's Sixth Amendment right to counsel \"is not exhausted once [the defendant] has one competent criminal defense lawyer.\u201d Dissent at 954; <em>see United States </em>v. <em>Lillie, </em>989 F.2d 1054, 1056 (9th Cir. 1993) (\u201c[T]he defendant can\u2019t be denied his choice of retained counsel just because ... the court thinks current counsel is doing an adequate job.\u201d), <em>overruled on other grounds by United States v. Garrett, 179 </em>F.3d 1143 (9th Cir. 1999) (en banc). But the adequacy of a defendant\u2019s alternatives is a relevant consideration in making a <em>pro hac vice </em>decision that necessarily weighs a criminal defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to counsel against competing policy considerations. <em>Cf. United States v.

We do not evaluate constitutional rights in a vacuum. Bundy may add whatever counsel he wishes so long as they satisfy Nevada's minimal <em>pro hac vice </em>rules.

The reasons for my dissent are essentially the same as for my earlier dissent to the majority\u2019s published decision denying the first mandamus petition.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See In re Bundy, </em>840 F.3d 1034, 1049 (9th Cir. 2016) (Gould, J., dissenting). So far as I can discern, Defendant Cliven Bundy\u2019s high-profile political status and prospects for retaining a skilled and aggressive defense team have not substantially changed since my prior dissent. I do not doubt that attorney Bret Whipple is a fine lawyer who has some federal criminal case experience. But the long course of American justice shows that sometimes representation by multiple attorneys is key to a robust defense.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> And I continue to believe that Bundy\u2019s needs for experienced defense counsel of his choosing are more important than the articulated concerns about Larry Klayman\u2019s ethics, where he has not been disbarred or suspended by another bar association or proven to have engaged in unethical conduct that could justify disbarment. <em>See In re Evans, </em>524 F.2d 1004, 1007 (5th Cir. 1975); <em>Schlum-berger Techs., Inc. v. Wiley, </em>113 F.3d 1553, 1561 (11th Cir. 1997). Attorney Klayman has told the district court and our appellate panel that he will in this case abide by all orders of the district court. I take him at his word on this.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-13\">This is a complex, multi-defendant proceeding, and the stakes could not be higher for Defendant Cliven Bundy. Bundy could spend the rest of his life in prison if convicted. To be sure, Klayman\u2019s aggressive tactics are likely to irritate the district court judge. But in a tough case with experienced prosecutors, forceful advocacy can be necessary to a full defense. And concerns over Klayman\u2019s aggressive style must yield to a superordinate concern: that Bundy have the counsel of his choice to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"954\">*954</page-number>receive a fair shake at this most critical trial. The government has chosen to marshal its massive resources towards convicting Bundy. We ought to let Bundy marshal the defense team he chooses. I rest my decision on the fundamental premise that Bundy has a Sixth Amendment right to counsel of his choice and that that right is not exhausted once he has one competent criminal defense lawyer. So long as he is footing the bill, the Sixth Amendment protects Bundy\u2019s right to convene a defense team of his choosing. <em>See United States v. Walters, </em>309 F.3d 589, 592 (9th Cir. 2002) (Sixth Amendment violation for <em>pro hac vice </em>denial where defendant was represented by other competent counsel). A system of extreme deference to a district court\u2019s decisions on <em>pro hac vice </em>admission of an experienced lawyer long-admitted to other bars is not a valid reason to deny Bundy his counsel of choice in the circumstances of this case. I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b961-9\">. I might have instead written a concurring opinion, accepting as circuit law the prior decision of this panel from which I previously dissented, but I think it makes my views clearer to understand when my views are framed as a dissent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b961-10\">. It is not uncommon for a high-profile criminal defendant to have a team of skilled defense lawyers. Well-known examples include O.J. Simpson's defense to the charged 1994 murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman, and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's defense to charges related to the 2013 bombing at the site of the Boston Marathon. Another famous case involving a defense team, this one without charges of violent crimes, was the so-called Scopes \u201cMonkey\u201d trial in 1925. There, Clarence Darrow and a team of several other distinguished lawyers defended a school teacher in Tennessee who had been charged with a crime for teaching evolution. <em>See Scopes Trial, </em>HistoryNet, http://www. historynet.com/scopes-trial.htm (last visited Mar. 28, 2017).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
