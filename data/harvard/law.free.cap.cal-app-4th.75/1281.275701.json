J.</author>\n<p id=\"pA1k\">Plaintiff Gayle Bauer appeals a judgment denying petition administrative mandate against defendants City of San Diego, San Diego City Council, San Diego Board of Zoning Appeals, and San Diego Developmental Services Department (together, City),  Bauer contends the court should have found that the City\u2019s procedure in deeming the 60-day suspension of Bauer\u2019s California Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC) license to terminate automatically Bauer\u2019s \u201cgrandfathered\u201d existing legal nonconforming use<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of her property as a liquor store under Business and Professions Code<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> section 23790<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> violated Bauer\u2019s due process rights to notice and the opportunity to be heard. Concluding Bauer was entitled to the opportunity to be heard on the issue of the termination of her grandfathered rights, we reverse the judgment and direct the superior court to grant a writ mandating the City to hold a new administrative hearing including adjudication of such termination issue before applying its zoning ordinance to require Bauer to obtain a conditional use permit (CUP) to resume selling alcoholic beverages at her business.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1286\">*1286</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b902-4\">Introduction</p>\n<p id=\"b902-5\">For more than 40 years, Bauer and her family have operated Hilltop Liquor, an ABC-licensed retail liquor outlet. In 1995 the City enacted a zoning ordinance requiring CUP\u2019s for operation of liquor stores. However, under the zoning ordinance\u2019s \u201cgrandfather clause,\u201d Bauer was permitted to continue operating her existing liquor store as a legal nonconforming use.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-6\">In 1997 the ABC suspended Bauer\u2019s liquor license for 60 days for selling alcohol to a minor. Without affording Bauer the opportunity to be heard on the issue whether Bauer\u2019s license suspension constituted a substantial change in the mode or character of the operation of Hilltop Liquor amounting to a break in the premises\u2019 continuous operation, the City deemed such license suspension to terminate automatically Bauer\u2019s grandfathered rights to continue operating Hilltop Liquor as an existing legal nonconforming use. Based upon its theory that Bauer\u2019s grandfathered rights had automatically terminated, the City told Bauer she must obtain a CUP before resuming sales of alcoholic beverages upon reinstatement of her ABC license. Hence, consistent with the City\u2019s directives, Bauer requested a CUP from the City. However, after an administrative hearing limited to the issue of Bauer\u2019s entitlement to a CUP, the City denied Bauer\u2019s CUP request. Ultimately, the superior court entered judgment denying Bauer\u2019s petition for administrative mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-7\">Concluding Bauer was entitled to an evidentiary administrative hearing, including adjudication of the issue whether the 60-day suspension of her ABC liquor license constituted a substantial change in the mode or character of Hilltop Liquor\u2019s operation amounting to a break in the continuous operation of the business so as to terminate Bauer\u2019s grandfathered rights to continue operating Hilltop Liquor as an existing legal nonconforming use, we reverse the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b902-9\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b902-10\">Bauer operates Hilltop Liquor on property she owns at 2499 Market Street in San Diego. Sales of alcoholic beverages comprise 60 to 65 percent of Bauer\u2019s income.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-11\">Effective November 20, 1995, section 101.0515 of the San Diego Municipal Code (the 1995 Zoning Ordinance) made it unlawful for an \u201cAlcoholic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1287\">*1287</page-number>Beverage Outlet\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to sell alcoholic beverages without first obtaining a CUP from the City. <em>(Id. </em>at subd. D.) However, the 1995 Zoning Ordinance permits an Alcoholic Beverage Outlet in existence on November 20, 1995, to continue to operate if the outlet \u201cretains the same type of retail liquor license within a license classification\u201d and \u201cis operated continuously without substantial change in the mode or character of operation.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at subd. P.1-2.) The 1995 Zoning Ordinance defines \u201csubstantial change in mode or character of operation\u201d to include revocation or suspension of the outlet\u2019s ABC license \u201cfor a period of more than thirty (30) days for any reason . . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at subd. P.2.c.)</p>\n<p id=\"b903-5\">Hilltop Liquor is located in an area with an over-concentration of alcoholic beverage licenses and/or a higher than average crime rate, as defined under section 23958.4. Five liquor licenses exist in Hilltop Liquor\u2019s census tract, although section 23958.4 allows only four. Further, Hilltop Liquor is situated within 100 feet of a residential zone boundary. However, since Hilltop Liquor was in operation as an ABC-licensed outlet on November 20, 1995, Bauer continued to operate the business without a CUP as a grandfathered existing legal nonconforming use under section 23790 and subdivision P of the 1995 Zoning Ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-6\">In October 1996 a Hilltop Liquor employee sold beer to a 19-year-old police decoy. On February 4, 1997, since such October 1996 incident was not Bauer\u2019s first license violation, the ABC suspended Bauer\u2019s liquor license for 60 days until April 5, 1997. During the suspension period, Hilltop Liquor remained open and sold items other than alcoholic beverages. However, on March 26, 1997, the City notified Bauer that because the ABC had suspended her liquor license for 60 days, she was required to obtain a CUP before resuming alcohol sales.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Hence, on May 7, 1997, Bauer applied to the City for a CUP to resume alcohol sales at Hilltop Liquor. On May 9, 1997, noting \u201c[t]his is a new enforcement process, and because of that, there was some delay in informing you of the requirement,\u201d the City permitted Bauer to \u201csell alcoholic beverages during the processing of your Conditional Use Permit application provided ABC reinstates the license.\u201d Hence, after the ABC reinstated Bauer\u2019s liquor license following the end of the suspension period, Hilltop Liquor resumed selling alcoholic beverages with the City\u2019s consent pending administrative determination of Bauer\u2019s request for a CUP.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1288\">*1288</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b904-4\">Administrative Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b904-5\">On July 16, 1997, the City\u2019s development services department held a hearing to consider Bauer\u2019s request for a CUP to resume liquor sales at Hilltop Liquor. Since the City had already deemed the 60-day suspension of Bauer\u2019s ABC license to constitute a substantial change in the mode or character of Hilltop Liquor\u2019s operation amounting to a break in the business\u2019s continuous operation so as to terminate automatically Bauer\u2019s grandfathered rights to continue operating Hilltop Liquor as an existing legal nonconforming use, the issue whether Bauer\u2019s grandfathered rights should be terminated was not presented to the hearing officer for determination. After hearing, the hearing officer denied Bauer\u2019s request for a CUP.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-6\">On August 27, 1997, the City\u2019s board of zoning appeals (BZA) held a hearing to consider Bauer\u2019s appeal of the hearing officer\u2019s denial of her request for a CUP. The City\u2019s administrative process did not present the BZA with the option of determining whether Hilltop Liquor had operated continuously without substantial change in the mode or character of its operation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> After hearing, the BZA denied Bauer\u2019s appeal of the hearing officer\u2019s denial of her request for a CUP.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-7\">In September 1997 Bauer appealed to the city council the BZA\u2019s decision denying her request for a CUP. Bauer\u2019s written appeal to the city council included an argument that section 23790 prohibited the City from applying the 1995 Zoning Ordinance retroactively to affect her assertedly vested property rights in her existing business. However, on December 2, 1997, the city council declined to hear Bauer\u2019s appeal of the BZA\u2019s decision denying her request for a CUP. The City notified Bauer that the city council\u2019s action denying her request for an appeal hearing meant that the BZA\u2019s decision was \u201cthe final discretionary action\u201d taken by the City on Bauer\u2019s request for a CUP and that Bauer had \u201cexhausted\u201d her \u201cappeal opportunities with the City.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b905-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1289\">*1289</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b905-4\">Superior Court Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b905-5\">On December 2, 1997, Bauer filed this lawsuit for administrative mandate, declaratory relief and, alternatively, inverse condemnation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b905-6\">On December 22, 1997, in accord with the parties\u2019 stipulation, the superior court preliminarily enjoined the City from taking any action to prevent Bauer from using her business premises as a nonconforming existing alcoholic beverage outlet.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-7\">On June 26, 1998, Bauer\u2019s petition for writ of administrative mandate came on for hearing in the superior court. After hearing, the court denied Bauer\u2019s petition. The court found: The suspension of Bauer\u2019s liquor license for 60 days constituted a substantial change in the mode or operation of the business; the City\u2019s requirement of a CUP from Bauer was consistent with subdivision P.2.c. of the 1995 Zoning Ordinance and authorized under section 23790; there was no preemption or improper retroactive application of zoning laws when the City required a CUP; and substantial evidence supported the City\u2019s denial of Bauer\u2019s CUP application.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-8\">Bauer appeals the judgment denying her petition for a writ of administrative mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-9\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b905-10\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b905-11\">This case presents the question whether the City was required to afford Bauer the opportunity to be heard before deeming her 60-day ABC liquor license suspension to constitute a substantial change in the mode or character of Hilltop Liquor\u2019s operation, amounting to a break in the premises\u2019 continuous operation so as to terminate automatically Bauer\u2019s grandfathered rights to resume operating her liquor sales business as an existing legal nonconforming use under section 23790 upon reinstatement of her liquor license after the suspension period.  As acknowledged by the City, pure questions of law are reviewed de novo by the appellate court. <em>(Rosenblit </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 1434, 1443 [282 Cal.Rptr. 819].)</p>\n<p id=\"b906-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1290\">*1290</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b906-4\">\n<em>Parties\u2019 Contentions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b906-5\">Bauer contends the City acted improperly in effectively applying its 1995 Zoning Ordinance retroactively to terminate the existing legal nonconforming use of her property as a licensed liquor store. Specifically, Bauer contends the City\u2019s procedure in deeming the 60-day suspension of her ABC license as automatically terminating her grandfathered vested property rights to continue operating Hilltop Liquor as a licensed liquor store violated her due process rights to notice, hearing and opportunity to be heard. According to Bauer, the proper threshold issue for determination by the hearing officer and implicitly by the BZA should have been whether the City had grounds to terminate her assertedly vested property rights under its police powers to regulate nuisances or to revoke existing rights not conforming to zoning. <em>(Korean American Legal Advocacy Foundation </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 376, 391-393, fn. 5 [28 Cal.Rptr.2d 530]; cf. <em>Malibu Mountains Recreation, Inc. </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles </em>(1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 359, 368 [79 Cal.Rptr.2d 25]; <em>Goat Hill Tavern </em>v. <em>City of Costa Mesa </em>(1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 1519, 1526-1529 [8 Cal.Rptr.2d 385].)</p>\n<p id=\"b906-6\">The City contends that upon the 60-day suspension of Bauer\u2019s ABC license, Hilltop Liquor\u2019s status as a legal nonconforming use ceased to exist, the business automatically came under the 1995 Zoning Ordinance\u2019s CUP requirement, and the business could not resume alcoholic beverage sales without obtaining a CUP from the City. The City also contends that even if the issue whether Bauer\u2019s license suspension terminated her grandfathered rights should have been adjudicated during its administrative hearing process, the judgment should nevertheless be affirmed because the administrative record assertedly contained sufficient evidence to support a determination that Bauer lost her grandfathered rights. However, because of the City\u2019s flawed process of deeming Bauer\u2019s grandfathered rights automatically terminated without first affording Bauer the opportunity to be heard on such issue, we conclude the judgment should be reversed with directions to the superior court to grant a writ mandating the City to hold a new administrative hearing including adjudication of the grandfathered rights termination issue before applying its 1995 Zoning Ordinance to require Bauer to obtain a CUP to resume selling alcoholic beverages at her business.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b906-8\">\n<em>Bauer Has Not Waived Appeal of the Issue Whether Her Grandfathered Rights Were Properly Deemed Terminated</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b906-9\">Preliminarily, the City contends Bauer has waived any right to challenge by this appeal the City\u2019s theory that she lost her grandfathered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1291\">*1291</page-number>rights upon suffering the 60-day suspension of her ABC license. Specifically, the City contends Bauer implicitly waived any right to raise such issue on appeal because she assertedly never raised that issue before the BZA. However, as noted, the City expressly acknowledges that its administrative procedures did not permit the BZA to determine whether Bauer\u2019s grandfathered rights had been lost. As also noted, the City asserts the BZA lacked authority to waive the 1995 Zoning Ordinance\u2019s CUP requirement once Hilltop Liquor automatically lost its status as a legal nonconforming use upon the 60-day suspension of its ABC license. Hence, in light of the City\u2019s administrative process, it would have been futile for Bauer to raise before the BZA the issue whether her grandfathered rights had been terminated. Further, the record indicates that in seeking relief at the highest administrative level, to wit, the city council, Bauer specifically argued that section 23790 prohibited the City from applying its 1995 Zoning Ordinance retroactively to affect her assertedly vested property rights in her existing business but the city council declined to hear Bauer\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">The City also contends that in the superior court Bauer waived both explicitly and implicitly any challenge to the loss of Hilltop Liquor\u2019s status as an existing legal nonconforming use. Specifically, the City notes that in replying to its opposition to her mandate petition in the superior court, Bauer submitted a memorandum stating that in seeking the writ she was \u201cnot asserting that the City lacks authority to require that she obtain a conditional use permit, or that it lacks authority to impose reasonable conditions upon the operation of her business.\u201d However, although the City characterizes such statement as an admission by Bauer that Hilltop Liquor\u2019s status as an existing legal nonconforming use had properly been deemed lost because of the 60-day ABC license suspension, the record indicates Bauer made such statement only in reply to a statute of limitations argument not addressed by the City in responding to this appeal. Further, when read in context, such statement simply reflects Bauer\u2019s recognition that the City may have the authority to regulate reasonably, but not terminate, an existing land use, and did not amount to a waiver of the issue whether Hilltop Liquor\u2019s status as an existing legal nonconforming use was terminated improperly by the City\u2019s retroactive application of the 1995 Zoning Ordinance. Moreover, at the superior court hearing, the City\u2019s counsel stated, \u201cthe threshold issue in this entire case, from the City\u2019s perspective, is whether or not petitioners had a legal nonconforming right after the 60-day suspension.\u201d Finally, as the City acknowledges, Bauer\u2019s brief in support of her petition for writ of mandate in the superior court expressly raised the issue whether the City retroactively applied the 1995 Zoning Ordinance\u2019s CUP requirement in violation of section 23790.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1292\">*1292</page-number>In sum, on this record Bauer has not waived her right to challenge by this appeal the City\u2019s theory that Bauer automatically lost her grandfathered rights upon suffering the 60-day suspension of her ABC license.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b908-4\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b908-5\">\n<em>Bauer Was Entitled to the Opportunity to Be Heard Before the City Determined Her Grandfathered Rights Were Terminated</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b908-6\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b908-7\">\n<em>The Law</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b908-8\">(a)</p>\n<p id=\"b908-9\">\n<em>Grandfathered Rights of Existing Liquor Licensees</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b908-10\">Generally, governmental entities do not apply newly enacted zoning ordinances to close businesses lawfully operating at the time those ordinances became effective. <em>(Hansen Brothers Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors, supra, </em>12 Cal.4th at p. 552;<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> see also <em>Livingston Rock etc. Co. </em>v. <em>County of L.A. </em>(1954) 43 Cal.2d 121, 127 [272 P.2d 4]; <em>Wilkins </em>v. <em>City of San Bernardino </em>(1946) 29 Cal.2d 332, 340 [175 P.2d 542].<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>)  Consistent with that general rule, section 23790 recognizes the grandfathered rights of liquor licensees operating legally on the effective date of a new zoning ordinance. <em>(City of Oakland </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>45 Cal.App.4th at p. 752; <em>Suzuki </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 263, 275, fn. 4 [51 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1293\">*1293</page-number>Cal.Rptr.2d 880].)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The Legislature intended that section 23790 \u201cprotect the vested rights of the proprietors of premises engaged in the lawful, licensed sale of alcoholic beverages. Such a business has acquired by the passage of time a vested right to continue in operation to lawfully dispense alcoholic beverages.\u201d <em>(City of Oakland </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>at p. 756.) Further, \u201creview of the legislative history of the 1982 and 1989 amendments to section 23790 indicates a legislative intent to protect vested interests of licensees otherwise lawfully engaged in a business subsequently made a nonconforming use by a commercial zoning ordinance.\u201d <em>(Suzuki </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles, supra, </em>at pp. 277-278.)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b909-4\">In essence, section 23790 prohibits the ABC from issuing any liquor licenses whose exercise would be contrary to a local zoning ordinance, except in cases of existing legal nonconforming uses with grandfathered rights. <em>(City of Oakland </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>45 Cal.App.4th at p. 752.) The statute also \u201cspecifies the conditions under which a licensee may retain his or her \u2018grandfathered\u2019 status as a \u2018deemed approved,\u2019 but nonconforming use for the particular geographic area.\u201d <em>(Korean American Legal Advocacy Foundation </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles, supra, </em>23 Cal.App.4th at p. 397.) The \u201cplain language\u201d of section 23790 \u201cexempts existing nonconforming uses from compliance with later enacted zoning ordinances . . . when the business has continuously operated without substantial change in either mode or character of operation.\u201d <em>(Suzuki </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles, supra, </em>44 Cal.App.4th at p. 277.)</p>\n<p id=\"b909-5\">Generally, the determination whether an existing legal nonconforming use should continue to be allowed under grandfathered provisions involves mixed questions of law and fact. (Cf. <em>Hansen Brothers Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors, supra, </em>12 Cal.4th at p. 552.) \u201cWhen continuance of an existing use is permitted by a zoning ordinance, the continued nonconforming use must be similar to the use existing at the time the zoning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1294\">*1294</page-number>ordinance became effective.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>\u201c [I]n determining whether the nonconforming use was the same before and after the passage of the zoning ordinance, each case must stand on its own facts.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em><footnotemark><em>13</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b910-4\">(b)</p>\n<p id=\"b910-5\">\n<em>Procedural Rights of Grandfathered Liquor Licensees</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b910-6\">\u201cOnce a licensee has acquired a conditional use permit, or has \u2018deemed approved\u2019 [(i.e., grandfathered)] status, a municipality\u2019s power to revoke the conditional use is limited. [Citation.] If the permittee has incurred substantial expense and acted in reliance on the permit, the permittee has acquired a vested property right in the permit and is entitled to the protections of due process before the permit may be revoked. [Citation.] \u2018In determining that a permit, validly issued, should be revoked, the governing body of a municipality acts in a quasi-judicial capacity. In revoking a permit lawfully granted, due process requires that it act only upon notice to the permittee, upon a hearing, and upon evidence substantially supporting a finding of revocation.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Korean American Legal Advocacy Foundation </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles, supra, </em>23 Cal.App.4th at pp. 391-392, fn. 5.) Further, \u201c \u2018[w]hen a permittee has acquired such a vested right it may be revoked if the permittee fails to comply with reasonable terms or conditions expressed in the permit granted [citations] or if there is a compelling public necessity. [Citations.]\u2019 [Citation.] A compelling public necessity warranting the revocation of a use permit for a lawful business may exist if the conduct of a business as a matter of fact constitutes a nuisance and the permittee refuses to comply with reasonable conditions to abate the nuisance. In these circumstances a municipality has the authority to remove such a business under its police power to prohibit and enjoin nuisances. [Citation.] However, in order to justify the interference with the constitutional right to carry on a lawful business it must be clear the public interests require such interference and that the means employed are reasonably necessary to accomplish the purpose and are not unduly oppressive on individuals.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 392, fn. 5.) Moreover, \u201c. . . it is clear revocation of a use permit could have the effect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1295\">*1295</page-number>of putting the licensee completely out of business. It is consequently a very harsh remedy which requires the strictest adherence to principles of due process. Whenever alternate remedies can achieve the same goal, such as the imposition of additional conditions or controls, these avenues ought to be pursued if feasible.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 392-393, fn. 5.)</p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\">In <em>Goat Hill Tavern </em>v. <em>City of Costa Mesa, supra, </em>6 Cal.App.4th 1519, the appellate court concluded the rights affected by Costa Mesa\u2019s refusal to renew Goat Hill Tavern\u2019s CUP were \u201csufficiently vested and important to preclude their extinction by a nonjudicial body.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1527.) The appellate court observed: \u201c \u2018When an administrative decision affects a right which has been <em>legitimately acquired </em>or is otherwise vested, and when that right is of a fundamental nature from the standpoint of its economic aspect or its effect... in human terms and the importance ... to the individual in the life situation, then a full and independent <em>judicial </em>review of that decision is indicated because [t]he abrogation of the right is too important to the individual to relegate it to exclusive administrative extinction.\u2019 [Citation.] [\u00b6] \u2018Whether an administrative decision substantially affects a fundamental vested right must be decided on a case-by-case basis. ... In deciding whether a right is \u201cfundamental\u201d and \u201cvested,\u201d the issue in each case is whether the \u201c \u2018affected right is deemed to be of sufficient significance to preclude its extinction or abridgment by a body lacking <em>judicial </em>power.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1526, italics in original.) The appellate court also observed: \u201cInterference with the right to continue an established business is far more serious than the interference a property owner experiences when denied a conditional use permit in the first instance. Certainly, this right is sufficiently personal, vested and important to preclude its extinction by a nonjudicial body.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1529.)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Similarly, in <em>Malibu Mountains Recreation, Inc. </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles, supra, 61 </em>Cal.App.4th 359, the appellate court concluded that \u201c. . . the grant of a CUP with subsequent reliance by the permittee creates a fundamental vested right that subjects a revocation to judicial review under the independent judgment test.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 368.)</p>\n<p id=\"b912-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1296\">*1296</page-number>2</p>\n<p id=\"b912-4\">\n<em>Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b912-5\">Although contemplating that the ABC may properly decline to issue a liquor license upon determining that the licensee\u2019s grandfathered rights have been lost, section 23790 does not define its terms \u201coperated continuously without substantial change in mode or character of operation\u201d or \u201cbreak in continuous operation.\u201d Further, the statute does not establish any procedure for determining that grandfathered rights have been terminated. As noted by the appellate court in <em>Korean American Legal Advocacy Foundation </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles, supra, </em>23 Cal.App.4th 376, \u201c. . . section 23790 does not address the issue of the retention of a liquor license once issued.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 397.)</p>\n<p id=\"b912-6\">Here, Bauer\u2019s ABC license was reinstated after completion of the 60-day suspension period. However, relying on its 1995 Zoning Ordinance and without affording Bauer the opportunity to be heard, the City simply deemed that \u201ca substantial change in mode or character of operation\u201d of Hilltop Liquor occurred automatically upon suspension of Bauer\u2019s ABC license for more than 30 days so that Bauer lost all grandfathered rights to continue operating her existing business as a legal nonconforming use under section 23790.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> As discussed, the City could not properly deem Bauer\u2019s grandfathered rights automatically terminated without providing Bauer with an opportunity to be heard. <em>(Korean American Legal Advocacy Foundation </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles, supra, </em>23 Cal.App.4th at pp. 391-393, fn. 5; cf. <em>Malibu Mountains Recreation, Inc. </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles, supra, 61 </em>Cal.App.4th at p. 368; <em>Goat Hill Tavern </em>v. <em>City of Costa Mesa, supra, 6 </em>Cal.App.4th at pp. 1526-1529.) Hence, before applying its 1995 Zoning Ordinance to require Bauer to obtain a CUP to resume selling alcoholic beverages at Hilltop Liquor, Bauer was entitled to an administrative hearing including an adjudication of the issue of the termination of her grandfathered rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-7\">As noted, the City has acknowledged that its administrative procedures did not require its administrative hearing bodies to make findings on the issue whether Hilltop Liquor had operated continuously without substantial change in the mode or character of its operation. The City has also maintained that its administrative bodies lacked authority to waive the 1995 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1297\">*1297</page-number>Zoning Ordinance\u2019s CUP requirement once Hilltop Liquor assertedly lost its status as an existing legal nonconforming use automatically upon suspension of Bauer\u2019s business\u2019s ABC license for more than 30 days. Nevertheless, the City contends that even if the issue whether Bauer had lost her grandfathered rights should have been adjudicated during its administrative hearing process, the judgment should nonetheless be affirmed because the administrative record assertedly contained sufficient evidence to support a finding that the 60-day suspension of Bauer\u2019s liquor license constituted a break in continuous operations terminating her grandfathered rights. However, on this record the City\u2019s contention must be rejected. Although the superior court effectively found that suspension of Bauer\u2019s ABC license terminated Bauer\u2019s grandfathered rights under section 23790 and the 1995 Zoning Ordinance, such finding was based solely on the evidentiary record of administrative proceedings that were limited to the issue whether Bauer\u2019s business should receive a CUP and in which termination of her grandfathered rights was not at issue or otherwise adjudicated but instead taken as a given by the administrative hearing bodies. Thus, since Bauer did not receive a full evidentiary hearing on the issue of termination of her grandfathered rights either at the administrative level or in the superior court\u2019s later review of the limited administrative record, the judgment must be reversed.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b913-5\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b913-6\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b913-7\"><em>A </em>writ of administrative mandate may properly issue where a municipality has prejudicially abused its discretion by not proceeding in the manner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1298\">*1298</page-number>required by law.

In light of the City\u2019s failure to proceed in the manner required by law, the superior court should have granted mandate directing the City to hold a new administrative hearing including adjudication of the issue of the termination of Bauer\u2019s grandfathered rights before applying its 1995 Zoning Ordinance to require Bauer to obtain a CUP to resume selling alcoholic beverages at her business.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b914-4\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b914-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b914-6\">The judgment is reversed.
