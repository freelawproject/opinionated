Eleanor Fain and her surety, Highlands Insurance Company (Highlands; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"977\">*977</page-number>collectively, the appellants), seek reversal of a \u201cJudgment After Trial\u201d entered after a 12-day bench trial conducted by an agreed-upon retired judge. The primary issues raised are whether the trial judge was properly appointed and empowered to render a binding judgment and, if so, whether substantial evidence was presented to support it. The respondents, Zjamahl Fain, successor administrator of the estate of Theodore Fain, and Traci Fain, an heir of that estate, urge the affirmance of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">As our review of the record persuades us that this matter was properly referred to the retired judge by a <em>\u201ctantamount stipulation\u201d </em>of the parties, substantial evidence supports the judgment and no prejudicial procedural errors occurred, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">Factual and Procedural Background<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">On October 12, 1990,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the decedent, Theodore Fain, died intestate. He left three heirs: his children, Preston, Zjamahl and Traci. At the request of the decedent\u2019s two sons (who were then in military service), the decedent\u2019s sister, Eleanor Fain,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> agreed to serve as administrator of the estate. She was appointed to that position by the trial court on November 29, 1990.  On the same date, a bond in the sum of $1.5 million was filed with Highlands as surety. Eleanor was represented in her capacity as administrator by the law firm of Kahn, Stern &amp; Blaney.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> However, that firm was replaced about four months later by the firm of Rotenberg &amp; Rotenberg. About nine months after that, Eleanor substituted herself in as counsel in propria persona.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"978\">*978</page-number>At the time of his death, the decedent owned both real and personal property. These assets, which included three multiple residential income properties and a single residential property, were appraised at a value in excess of $3 million. Complaining about difficulties in maintaining and managing these real properties, particularly the apartment buildings (as to which she claimed to have had difficulty in collecting rents, making repairs and meeting mortgage and other obligations), Eleanor resigned as the administrator of the estate effective March 1, 1992.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On April 10, 1992, the trial court, acting on the petition of Zjamahl, formally removed Eleanor as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"979\">*979</page-number>administrator and appointed Zjamahl as special administrator in her place with special powers \u201cto deal with all estate property, both real and personal . . .\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> At the same time, the court ordered Eleanor to file a final account of the estate <em>by no later than June 27, 1992, </em>\u201cand on settlement of the account, [to] surrender the assets of the estate to Zjamahl Fain, the duly appointed and qualified special administrator of this estate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">Despite such order, Eleanor did not file any accounting by the designated date. In addition, she failed to turn over or account for assets which had been in her possession or under her control. On August 12, 1992, the court issued, at the request of Zjamahl, the special administrator, an order directed to Eleanor and requiring her to show cause why she should not be held in contempt for her failure to comply with the court\u2019s order of April 10, 1992.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This order was returnable on September 9, 1992, but Eleanor retained new counsel and obtained an extension.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">On October 30, 1992, Eleanor filed a petition for settlement and final account of former administration, set for hearing on November 30, 1992. On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"980\">*980</page-number>November 2, Zjamahl, as the special administrator and Traci, in her capacity as an heir, filed objections to the petition. The November 30 hearing date was continued to January 25, 1993,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> at which time a mandatory settlement conference (MSC) was set for May 5, 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">At the May 5 MSC, the matter was recalendared for a voluntary settlement conference on September 15, 1993, which was later continued three separate times to August 25, 1994. On this latter date, the matter was then reset for a further MSC on November 29, 1994, but this conference was also continued two more times to July 27, 1995.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> On this date, the probate commissioner to whom this matter had been assigned informed all counsel that the court did not have \u201cthe facilities to try this case\u201d;<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and if counsel could not reach a mutual agreement as to a referee to try the issues relating to Eleanor\u2019s alleged (1) unbalanced account, (2) missing assets and (3) breach of fiduciary duty, then he would appoint a referee of his own choosing to try such issues. The commissioner then set a status conference for September 27, 1995 at which time the parties were to advise the court as to the name of the agreed upon private judge. <em>Neither Eleanor nor Highlands expressed any objection to this procedure.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">On September 26, 1995, a status conference statement was filed which stated, in part: \u201cCounsel for the parties have conferred and agreed to use the Honorable Raymond Choate to <em>try </em>the accounting matter. January 15, 16, 17, 18 and 19 have been reserved <em>for the trial on the accounting issue and for determination of any appropriate surcharge against Eleanor Fain.\u201d </em>(Italics added.)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Neither Eleanor nor Highlands made any objection or took any exception to this statement.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">On November 15, 1995, after this matter had been set for trial before Judge Choate, Highlands, in a related case entitled Highlands Ins. Co. v. Fain (Super. Ct. L.A. County, No. BC 058540) moved for an order extending <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"981\">*981</page-number>attachment lien which Highlands had previously obtained against Eleanor on December 1, 1992. Highlands\u2019s counsel expressly states in an accompanying declaration: \u201cNo judgment has yet been obtained herein and the related matter [referring to this case] is presently <em>set for trial </em>on January 15, 1996.\u201d All parties agreed to reschedule the trial to August 26, 1996, in order to accommodate Judge Choate\u2019s schedule. All counsel, including counsel for Highlands, confirmed, in writing, new discovery cutoff dates for trial. On August 1, 1996, all counsel stipulated in writing to transfer of the court files from the probate court to JAMS<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> for trial before Judge Choate on August 26, 1996. Attorney Bruce Schwartz, Eleanor\u2019s counsel, signed for her and Attorney Michael Guglielmino, Highlands\u2019s counsel, signed on its behalf. On August 21, 1996, Attorney Betty Barrington (counsel for Traci), on behalf of all counsel, obtained an ex parte order to transport the file to JAMS for trial. On January 2, 1996, JAMS sent a letter to all counsel confirming that all parties had agreed to schedule a four-day \u201cpro <em>tem trial.\u201d </em>(Italics added.) <em>Neither Eleanor nor Highlands expressed any objection to this notice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">Between the date of Eleanor\u2019s removal as administrator, April 10, 1992, and the commencement of trial on August 26, 1996, the trial court had scheduled over 20 hearings to require her to file a balanced court accounting. When she finally did produce what she alleged was a proper and balanced final accounting, the newly appointed special administrator of the estate filed objections alleging that such accounting showed a shortage of more than $1 million and that estate assets were missing from her inventory.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">On May 28, 1996, Sharon Miller of Mr. Blaney\u2019s office (then counsel for both objecting parties, Zjamahl and Traci) sent a letter to all counsel confirming trial cutoff dates. Highlands\u2019s counsel, Mr. Guglielmino countersigned the letter on June 3, 1996. On August 26, 1996, immediately prior to the commencement of trial, all counsel waived a court reporter or audio recorder.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> At no time prior to or during the trial did appellants state or contend that the proceeding was anything other than a trial. Indeed, all parties treated the proceeding as a trial. By way of further example, documents filed by Eleanor, joined into by Highlands, included: (1) \u201cDocuments to be Introduced at Time of Trial\u201d; (2) \u201cList of Witnesses to be Called at Time of Trial\u201d; (3) \u201cTrial Brief\u2019; and (4) \u201cStipulation to Transfer Files to JAMS for Trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b690-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"982\">*982</page-number>The trial commenced on August 26, 1996, and was conducted over 12 trial days, although not consecutively. It concluded on November 19, 1996. Twenty-two witnesses were called, over 90 exhibits introduced and more than $50,000 was incurred as trial expenses and costs by the estate. On the last day of trial, all parties waived the procedural deadline for Judge Choate to render his decision due to his schedule, the upcoming holiday season and counsel\u2019s schedules.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">On February 14, 1997, Judge Choate signed and caused to be mailed to counsel a document entitled \u201cRulings of Judge Pro Tem.\u201d In that document, he announced his decision in favor of the estate and against Eleanor. That ruling stated, in pertinent part: \u201cRaymond Choate, Retired Judge of the said Superior court, having heard the trial of this matter of the Estate of Theodore Fain, now rules as follows: <em>submitted to binding arbitration as follows </em>:[<footnotemark>14</footnotemark>] [\u00b6]1. The Ruling is made in favor of the Estate of Theodore F. Fain, Decedent, and against Eleanor J. Fain, for the sum of $715,000.00 plus a surcharge of $7,150.00; [\u00b6] 2. Attorney\u2019s fees are awarded to the law firm of Kahn, Stem and Blaney Attorneys at Law, in the amount of $150,000.00 plus costs expended in the lawsuit, per cost bill, of $50,000.00 for their representation of the Estate of Theodore F. Fain, against Eleanor J. Fain.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">Some confusion has been caused by the above italicized matter as well as by the caption of the document in which the ruling appears. That caption reads: \u201cIn the Matter of the Binding Arbitration Between.\u201d Then, where the contesting parties\u2019 names would normally be set out, the caption continues: \u201cIn the Matter of the Estate of Theodore F. Fain, a.k.a. Ted Fain.\u201d Eleanor and Highlands make much of this contradictory and confusing wording. Given the clear record before us, however, we can only conclude that a simple word processing error has occurred. The italicized matter is contradictory to what precedes it and is inconsistent with all of the acts and statements of counsel prior to issuance of this notice of ruling. As we discuss below, that the proceedings before Judge Choate were intended by the parties as a trial is really beyond argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">This confusing reference to \u201cbinding arbitration\u201d was brought to Judge Choate\u2019s attention at a reported hearing on March 10, 1997. Counsel for Eleanor had this to say about <em>his </em>understanding of the nature and character of the proceedings which commenced on August 26, 1996: \u201c[Mr. Schwartz]: <em>So it\u2019s my understanding that we were here for trial. That\u2019s the long and short of it. </em>Now, how that figures into all of this, I\u2019m not quite sure. But that\u2019s my <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"983\">*983</page-number>recollection as to what occurred. [\u00b6] Insofar as binding arbitration, I was never advised by anyone that this was a binding arbitration. <em>It was always my understanding that we are here for trial on the merits. </em>[\u00b6] The Court: I thought we were here for trial and we used the term \u2018trial.\u2019 But sometimes it\u2019s used loosely by people who are really arbitrating. But I thought it was probably a trial.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">The discussion then turned to the need for a statement of decision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-6\">\u201cThe Court: Have you offered a Statement of Decision?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-7\">\u201cMr. Guglielmino [counsel for Highlands]: I\u2019ve demanded one, but I haven\u2019t offered a proposal yet because of the confusion over whether this was an arbitration or a trial or whether that was a ruling on an arbitration or a judgment\u2014a tentative ruling on a judgment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-8\">\u201cAnd I requested, in light of those facts, time to'prepare a Statement of Decision should The Court rule that this was indeed a trial on the merits by a pro tern rather than an arbitration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-9\">\u201cOf course, if your ruling is that you believe that it was an arbitration, then the rules change and our procedure changes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-10\">\u201cThe Court: Well, I think that the former is what we did. It was a trial by a judge pro tern, and a Statement of Decision would still be required.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-11\">\u201cMr. Guglielmino: So Statement of Decision by The Court by the 14th of April, and you will submit one back to us by the 24th?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-12\">\u201cThe Court: Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b691-13\">Thereafter, the respondents (the estate and Traci as objecting parties) submitted a proposed statement of decision on April 13, 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-14\"><em>However, neither Eleanor nor Highlands ever submitted one. </em>On March 11, 1997, Highlands sought a 30-day extension for the submission of a statement of decision, which was granted. In counsel\u2019s application for such extension, he stated: <em>\u201cIt is our understanding that the matter was submitted to you, as Judge Pro Tem of the Los Angeles Superior Court, for trial on the merits, </em>[\u00b6] Given the extraordinary length of the trial of this matter and the voluminous amount of documentation and testimony comprising the evidence that was submitted to the court in connection with this case, Highlands intends to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"984\">*984</page-number>assist the court by submitting proposals as to the content of the statement of decision.\u201d (Italics added.) However, counsel for Highlands never did provide that assistance and, as noted, no proposed statement of decision was ever submitted on behalf of Eleanor or Highlands.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\">On June 9, 1997, Judge Choate signed the statement of decision which had been submitted by counsel for the estate. In that statement, Judge Choate articulated in some detail the basis for his conclusion that Eleanor should be surcharged.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> He concluded: \u201cAfter a two week trial, the Court finds that Eleanor Fain\u2019s acts were in bad faith and that she breached the fiduciary duty owing to the estate and finds in favor of the Estate of Theodore F. Fain and against Eleanor J. Fain for the sum of $715,000, plus interest at 10%. In addition, evidence supports that the law firm of Kahn, Stern &amp; Blaney, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"985\">*985</page-number>attorneys at law, are entitled to $150,000 of attorney fees for extraordinary services performed which services were a direct consequence of Ms. Fain\u2019s actions, plus costs of $50,000, which were expended in this lawsuit against Ms. Fain.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">On July 24, 1997, Highlands filed with the trial court a document entitled \u201cPetition To Vacate Binding Arbitration Award\u201d and a week later, on August 1, it filed objections to the statement of decision which had been signed by Judge Choate nearly two months earlier, on June 9, 1997. After opposition to these pleadings were filed by respondents, Highlands\u2019 pleadings (along with the entire court file in this matter) was submitted to the presiding probate court judge. The issues raised by Highlands were argued by counsel on September 25 and, on November 3, 1997, the court denied Highlands\u2019 motion. In its minute order the trial court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-6\">\u201cAfter reviewing the court file, the Court finds that even a cursory review shows that this matter was submitted to Judge Raymond Choate for trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-7\">\u201cIn the Declaration of November 15, 1995, the attorney for Highlands Insurance stated, \u2018. . . related matter is presently set for trial on January 15, 1996.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-8\">\u201cOn August 1, 1996, the attorney for Highlands Insurance stipulated that the court file, \u2018. . .be transferred from the Court to the Honorable Raymond Choate for trial on October 26, 1996.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-9\">\u201cOn June 9, 1997 in a letter from Judge Choate, he said that the Statement of Decision and Judgment After Trial had been signed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-10\">\u201cThe Court finds that based on numerous examples, three of which are stated above, this matter was submitted for trial to Judge Raymond Choate. Additionally, the Court finds that the words, \u2018binding arbitration\u2019 do not control over the substance of the proceedings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-11\">\u201cPetition to Vacate Binding Arbitration is denied.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b693-12\">Thereafter, on November 13, 1997, Judge Choate signed a judgment in accordance with his statement of decision. It was entitled \u201cJudgment After Trial\u201d and was filed on December 5, 1997.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Eleanor and Highlands have prosecuted this timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"986\">*986</page-number>Contention of the Parties</p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\">While presented in multiple articulations, the principal objection raised by appellants is that Judge Choate did not have the authority to render a binding judgment. Appellants contend that they never agreed or consented to an arbitration or Judge Choate as an arbitrator; thus, the \u201cjudgment\u201d cannot be sustained as an arbitration award. It is appellants\u2019 view that Judge Choate was, at most, a referee appointed by the trial court, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 639, subdivision (a), or under Probate Code section 11002, subdivision (b),<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> to conduct the examination and resolution of a long account; thus, Judge Choate\u2019s authority was limited to a report back to the trial judge upon such account. Appellants also contend that they did not consent to a general reference under Code of Civil Procedure section 638<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and thus Judge Choate\u2019s action cannot be justified on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">Finally, appellants argue that there was no substantial evidence to support a surcharge against Eleanor nor any factual or legal basis for the award to respondents of $200,000 in attorney\u2019s fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">Respondents, on the other hand, argue that appellants entered into an implied, if not an express, <em>stipulation </em>to have Judge Choate hear the case as a temporary judge which stipulation was approved by the trial court; as a result, the judgment, which was entered following the 12-day trial before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"987\">*987</page-number>Judge Choate, was procedurally proper.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Respondents further contend that the evidence fully supports the judgment imposing a surcharge and an attorney\u2019s fee award on Eleanor and Highlands.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">The principal issue raised by the lengthy briefs filed by the parties is really rather simple. It involves the question of whether the parties to this dispute, in effect, stipulated that Judge Choate, a retired Los Angeles Superior Court judge, could try the issues raised in the contested probate proceedings as a temporary judge. As the relevant facts are not in dispute, we resolve this question as a matter of law. (See generally, <em>Pennsylvania Health &amp; Life Ins. Guaranty Assn. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1994) 22 Cal.App.4th 477, 480 [27 Cal.Rptr.2d 507]; <em>Robbins </em>v. <em>Foothill Nissan </em>(1994) 22 Cal.App.4th 1769, 1774 [28 Cal.Rptr.2d 190].) The same is true for appellants\u2019 contentions that a surcharge and attorney\u2019s fee award could not be legally imposed. However, with respect to appellants\u2019 arguments regarding the sufficiency of the evidence, we apply a substantial evidence standard of review. Under that standard, we inquire only whether, in light of the record as a whole, there is substantial evidence to support the judgment. (See generally, <em>Bowers </em>v. <em>Bernards </em>(1984) 150 Cal.App.3d 870, 872-874 [197 Cal.Rptr. 925].) As we point out below, where the appellant fails to produce a complete record of oral trial proceedings, a challenge based on the claim of evidence insufficiency will not be heard. <em>(Construction Financial </em>v. <em>Perlite Plastering Co. </em>(1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 170, 179 [61 Cal.Rptr.2d 574].)</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">1. <em>The Parties Stipulated to a Trial on the Merits by a Temporary Judge</em></p>\n<p id=\"b695-8\">This record clearly demonstrates that the parties were simply unable, after over a two-year period of continuing and repeated delays, to get their contested probate proceeding tried in the superior court. The commissioner assigned to hear the matter finally urged the parties to agree on a private judge who could hear and decide the case. From a long list of private judges, the parties agreed on Judge Choate. As we have recited in some detail, the parties clearly acted and behaved as though the matter had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"988\">*988</page-number>transferred to Judge Choate <em>for a trial.</em><footnotemark><em>20</em></footnotemark><em> </em>It was not an arbitration nor a reference proceeding under the Code of Civil Procedure or the Probate Code. It was, in legal effect, a trial on the merits by a temporary judge pursuant to article VI, section 21, of the California Constitution. It is worth noting that neither Eleanor nor Highlands ever contended otherwise until <em>after </em>Judge Choate issued his statement of decision on June 9, 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">Article VI, section 21 of the California Constitution provides: \u201c \u2018On stipulation of the parties litigant the court may order a cause to be tried by a temporary judge who is a member of the State Bar, sworn and empowered to act until final determination of the cause.\u2019 [\u00b6] Rule 244 of the California Rules of Court (hereafter rule 244) amplifies these requirements, particularly by providing for written stipulations. It provides in pertinent part: \u2018The stipulation of the parties litigant that a case may be tried by a temporary judge shall be in writing .... It shall be submitted for approval to the presiding judge or to the supervising judge of a branch court. The order designating the temporary judge shall be endorsed upon the stipulation, which shall then be filed. The temporary judge shall take and subscribe the oath of office, which shall be attached to the stipulation and order of designation, and the case shall then be assigned to the temporary judge for trial. After the oath is filed, the temporary judge may proceed with the hearing, trial and determination of the case.\u2019 \u201d <em>(In re Richard S. </em>(1991) 54 Cal.3d 857, 861 [2 Cal.Rptr.2d 2, 819 P.2d 843].) Admittedly, these technical requirements imposed by California Rules of Court rule 244 were not met in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">However, it is now clear that such stipulation to a temporary judge need neither be in writing nor expressly stated. It may be <em>implied </em>from the conduct of the parties. <em>(In re Horton </em>(1991) 54 Cal.3d 82 [284 Cal.Rptr. 305, 813 P.2d 1335].) \u201c[W]e have ratified a line of cases recognizing that a valid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"989\">*989</page-number>stipulation for purposes of the constitutional provision may arise as a result of the <em>conduct </em>of the parties. These cases hold that conduct short of an express oral or written stipulation may be tantamount to a stipulation that a court commissioner may sit as a temporary judge. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 91 italics in original.) This principle has also been applied to a juvenile court referee <em>(In re Richard S., supra, </em>54 Cal.3d at pp. 865-866; <em>In re Lamonica H. </em>(1990) 220 Cal.App.3d 634, 644 [270 Cal.Rptr. 60]) and to a retired juvenile court referee <em>(In re Robert S. </em>(1988) 197 Cal.App.3d 1260, 1265 [243 Cal.Rptr. 459]). It is also clear that the procedural requirements set out in rule 244 are <em>directory, </em>not mandatory <em>(In re Lamonica H., supra, </em>220 Cal.App.3d at pp. 642-645 [\u201c. . . the requirements of rule 244, while obligatory, may be given only directory effect\u201d]); thus, a written stipulation is not required by the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">As one court put it, where the acts of a referee were attacked, \u201cWhere a party to a proceeding heard by a referee has in fact expressly <em>or impliedly </em>agreed that the referee may sit as temporary judge pursuant to article VI, section 21 of the Constitution, it is difficult for us to fathom what legitimate interest the party has in the method by which his agreement is memorialized. <em>Whether consent is oral, written, express or implied, if in fact a party agrees to proceed before a referee and thereafter receives a ruling on the merits from the referee, his reasonable expectations have been fulfilled. </em>Thus the detailed procedure set forth in rule 244 appears to us designed to serve collateral interests of the judicial system. By requiring a written instrument, the rule prevents disputes as to whether parties have in fact consented and the scope of their consent. [Citation.] By further requiring the written approval of a supervising judge and an oath, the rule insures that the activities of temporary judges are monitored and do not impair the administration of the trial courts. These interests are entirely unrelated to [the litigant\u2019s] interest in having his dispute heard in a competent and unbiased tribunal.\u201d <em>(In re Lamonica H., supra, </em>220 Cal.App.3d at p. 644, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">This commonsense approach is based on the simple proposition, as articulated by'the court in <em>Estate of Lacy </em>(1975) 54 Cal.App.3d 172 [126 Cal.Rptr. 432], that \u201c[a]n attorney may not sit back, fully participate in a trial and then claim that the court was without jurisdiction on receiving a result unfavorable to him.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 182.) We see no reason why the foregoing authorities, which recognize and apply the so-called \u201ctantamount stipulation\u201d doctrine (for the appointment of a judge pro tem) to a commissioner, a referee and a retired referee would not also apply it to a retired superior court judge. To paraphrase the decision in <em>In re Lamonica H., supra, 220 </em>Cal.App.3d 634 (quoted above), which was relied upon by the Supreme Court in <em>In re </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"990\">*990</page-number><em>Richard </em>S.,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> the services of a retired superior court judge, to which the parties have at least tacitly agreed and which are fully utilized by them through the announcement of a judgment certainly serves the interests of those parties in having their dispute heard in a competent and unbiased tribunal and their reasonable expectations have been fulfilled. \u201c[W]hen the requirements of article VI, section 21 are otherwise met, the parties by their stipulation to trial by a referee sitting as a temporary judge, waive any claim of error on the basis of failure to strictly comply with that rule.\u201d <em>(In re Richard S. supra, </em>54 Cal.3d at p. 866.)</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">It is clear as well that the doctrine of tantamount stipulation can be based entirely on the conduct of a party\u2019s attorney. <em>(In re Horton, supra, </em>54 Cal.3d at pp. 92-93.) The facts in this case amply demonstrate that counsel for both Eleanor and Highlands repeatedly recognized and consented to the trial of the contested probate matter by Judge Choate and counsel for <em>all </em>of the parties deliberated at length before agreeing on Judge Choate to try the case. Throughout the lengthy trial there was no objection to the proceedings. Moreover, counsel filed a wide array of documents (e.g., <em>trial </em>briefs and lists of documents and witnesses to be introduced and called at <em>trial). </em>At the conclusion of the trial, counsel for <em>both </em>Eleanor and Highlands expressed the view on the record or in written court documents that they at all times understood that the matter had been submitted to Judge Choate, as a temporary judge, to try it on the merits.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Thereafter, the supervising probate judge, after reviewing the entire probate file, concluded that this matter had been submitted to Judge Choate for trial. In our view, the trial court\u2019s minute order of November 2, 1997, was the effective equivalent of the posthearing order authorizing a referee to sit as a temporary judge which was recognized by the Supreme Court as sufficient to satisfy the requirements of California Constitution, article VI, section 21. <em>(In re Richard S., supra, </em>54 Cal.3d at pp. 865-867.)</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">We thus conclude that the parties entered into a stipulation that Judge Choate would try the contested probate matter as a temporary judge, that stipulation was approved by the probate commissioner and, after the fact, the supervising probate judge. Judge Choate, as a retired superior court judge, clearly met the requirement of a sworn judicial officer and was empowered to act. Thus, all of the requirements of California Constitution article VI, section 21 were met. Judge Choate was authorized\u2014indeed required\u2014to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"991\">*991</page-number>sign and file a statement of decision and a judgment. He did so and no procedural error occurred.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">2. <em>Substantial Evidence Supports the Surcharge and Award of Attorney\u2019s Fees</em></p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">Judge Choate was tasked to try the contested probate proceedings which arose from respondents\u2019 objections to Eleanor\u2019s proposed final account. Those objections included the alleged claims that Eleanor (1) had not submitted a balanced account, (2) could not account for missing assets and (3) had breached her fiduciary duties as administrator of the estate. These are all matters which may be the subject of a contest. (Prob. Code, \u00a7 11001.)<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> It is the court\u2019s duty to scrutinize accounts and determine all issues raised by a petition to approve any account. (See generally Ross, Cal. Practice Guide: Probate (The Rutter Group 1998) \u00b6\u00b6 16:164-16:164.1.)  \u201cObjections to accountings commonly raise <em>surcharge </em>claims- against their representative for purported acts of misconduct, neglect, waste, mismanagement or other breach of fiduciary duty. These grounds fall under the general category of \u2018all matters relating to an account\u2019 which may be contested \u2018for cause shown\u2019 (Prob. C. \u00a7 11001).\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at \u00b6 16:177.)</p>\n<p id=\"b699-8\">Illustrations of acts subject to surcharge are: (1) damages suffered by reason of the representative\u2019s neglect or misconduct in sale proceedings (Prob. Code, \u00a7 10380); (2) negligent failure to collect assets, causing loss to estate <em>(Estate of Massaglia </em>(1974) 38 Cal.App.3d 767, 773-775 [113 Cal.Rptr. 751]); (3) failing to diligently attempt selling depreciating estate residence <em>(Layton </em>v. <em>State Bar </em>(1990) 50 Cal.3d 889, 900-902 [268 Cal.Rptr. 845, 789 P.2d 1026]); (4) failure to liquidate assets when required to satisfy taxes, debts and administration cost <em>(Estate of Gerber </em>(1977) 73 Cal.App.3d 96, 108-110 [140 Cal.Rptr. 577]); and (5) negligent or deliberate failure to defend unjustified claims and litigation against the estate <em>(Estate of McSweeney </em>(1954) 123 Cal.App.2d 787, 794 [268 P.2d 107]).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"992\">*992</page-number>Probate Code section 8800, subdivision (a), provides that the personal representative shall file with the court clerk an inventory of property to be administered in the decedent\u2019s estate. Section 8804 further provides that if the personal representative refuses or negligently fails to file an inventory and appraisal within the statutory time, the court may impose personal liability upon the representative personal representative for injury to the estate. Such liability may include attorney fees. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Damages thus awarded are a liability on the bond of the personal representative. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">In the instant case, Judge Choate concluded that Eleanor had failed to marshall all of the estate\u2019s assets and had failed to file a full and complete inventory, thereby necessitating the estate to undertake extensive discovery in order to identify estate assets. Extraordinary services performed by the administrator and its counsel in the segregation of assets, reconstruction of inventories from documents and other evidence and other problems of processing an estate which are the direct consequence of the administrator\u2019s negligence are an element of surcharge. <em>(Estate of Gerber, supra, </em>73 Cal.App.3d at pp. 118-119.) \u201cThe elements of surcharge representing extraordinary attorney\u2019s fees and executor\u2019s commissions <em>not </em>directly related to the litigation constitute administration expenses which are ordinarily awarded upon a showing that the charges are reasonable and that the services were necessarily incurred in administration.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 118, italics in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">With these basic principles in mind we turn to appellants\u2019 contention that there is not sufficient evidence to support the judgment imposing the surcharge and award of attorney\u2019s fees. It is at this point that the parties\u2019 failure to have the 12-day trial reported becomes critical.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">Where no reporter\u2019s transcript has been provided and no error is apparent on the face of the existing appellate record, the judgment must be <em>conclusively presumed correct </em>as to <em>all evidentiary matters. </em>To put it another way, it is presumed that the unreported trial testimony would demonstrate the absence of error. <em>(Ehrler </em>v. <em>Ehrler </em>(1981) 126 Cal.App.3d 147, 153-154 [178 Cal.Rptr. 642].) The effect of this rule is that an appellant who attacks a judgment but supplies no reporter\u2019s transcript will be precluded from raising an argument as to the sufficiency of the evidence. <em>(Sui </em>v. <em>Landi </em>(1985) 163 Cal.App.3d 383, 385-386 [209 Cal.Rptr. 449]; <em>National Secretarial Service, Inc. </em>v. <em>Froehlick </em>(1989) 210 Cal.App.3d 510, 521-522 [258 Cal.Rptr. 506].)</p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">Here Judge Choate\u2019s statement of decision reflects his findings that Eleanor (1) mismanaged estate assets, (2) allowed the assets to become <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"993\">*993</page-number>dilapidated, (3) failed to collect rents and (4) permitted the estate\u2019s income properties to be vandalized and inhabited by vagrants. Judge Choate, just by way of specific example, found from the evidence such things as: (1) \u201cMs. Fain\u2019s failure to inspect, repair and keep the income property located at 4808-4816 August Street, Los Angeles in a condition fit for tenant occupation resulted in a property value decrease of not less than $150,000 in a six month period.\u201d (2) \u201cThe monthly rent collection on the 4808-4816 property decreased from an average of $8,499 a month immediately prior to the decedent\u2019s death, down to $0 within three months of his death. Ms. Fain testified she made no attempt to personally collect the rent on this property nor did she hire a property manager to collect the rent. [\u00b6] The accounting and amendments thereto filed by Eleanor Fain confirmed a loss of rental income of several hundred thousand dollars not only from the 4808-4816 August Street property, but also from all the estate income units. Testimony from Eleanor Fain further confirmed she failed to maintain adequate financial records and control of rental income collected from the estate income properties located at 4808-4816 August Street, 4709 August Street, and 4040 Coco Avenue, all in Los Angeles, California; and she failed to identify all tenants, to verify their rental agreements or rental payments or set-up any mechanism to do so.\u201d (3) \u201cMs. Fain failed to promptly list all estate real property for sale. When she did list property, she failed to timely communicate and cooperate with the listing brokers, failed to provide access to the property and failed to timely respond to purchase offers. . . . As a result of these acts, the estate incurred unnecessary financial loss.\u201d (4) \u201cAt the time of Ms. Fain\u2019s abandonment of the estate, [in March of 1992], the property at 4709 August Street in Los Angeles, had, according to evidence presented and testimony by Victor Pelacios, incurred between 40-42 health and safety code violations; sewers had backed up with sewage seeping under one of the apartment buildings, vagrants had overrun and destroyed many of the units making them uninhabitable and vacancies had substantially increased. [\u00b6] The evidence presented and testimony established that as a direct result of Ms. Fain\u2019s failure to use estate monies appropriately, the estate incurred late mortgage payments penalties, foreclosure costs and forced co-insurance payments on both the 4709 August Street, 4040 Coco Avenue and the residential property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">Judge Choate concluded that, \u201cBut for Ms. Fain\u2019s gross negligence as outlined above, the estate would not have suffered the loss of several hundred thousand dollars of rental income from the estate properties and would have realized a minimum of not less than $150,000 of additional monies in the sale of the 4808-4816 August Street property. These amounts are appropriate surcharges against Ms. Fain under Probate Code section 9601(3).\u201d He found based on all of the evidence that such surcharge should be in the sum of $715,000, plus interest at 10 percent.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"994\">*994</page-number>In addition, Judge Choate held that, \u201cAny extraordinary services performed by counsel which were a direct consequence of the former executor\u2019s negligence are allowed as a surcharge against the executor. . . . Here, the extraordinary services performed by the Kahn, Stern &amp; Blaney law firm were detailed with extensive time records showing the extent of the services they had to render due to Ms. Fain\u2019s actions and inactions. Based on this evidence, and the trial costs submitted by the Kahn, Stem &amp; Blaney firm, an award of $150,000 of attorney fees and $50,000 of trial costs are appropriate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">We find no error appearing on the face of the statement of decision or the judgment. Indeed, appellants argue only that there is \u201cno comprehensive calculation\u201d to demonstrate just how Judge Choate arrived at the figure of $715,000. They emphasize that this amount was more than originally sought in the respondents\u2019 pleadings. However, these objections are not fatal to the award. After 12 days of trial testimony from 22 witnesses and over 90 written exhibits, Judge Choate may well have received evidence to support the higher figure. At least, we must conclusively presume that he did so.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">Appellants also attack the award of attorney\u2019s fees in the sum of $150,000 as not being justified in law or fact. As to the latter, Judge Choate stated that he received evidence that demonstrated the reasonableness and necessity of the fees charged for extraordinary services provided to the estate. Again, we must conclusively presume that such evidence was presented. Appellants\u2019 legal objection appears to rest on their assumption that the fee award was based on a finding that Eleanor had opposed respondents\u2019 objections to her final accounting in bad faith. (See Prob. Code, \u00a7 11003, subd. (b).) We do not so read Judge Choate\u2019s decision. The award was for fees incurred as the result of work on behalf of the estate which was required because of Eleanor\u2019s failure to properly discharge her fiduciary duties to the estate. Such an award is entirely justified. <em>(Estate of Gerber, supra, </em>73 Cal.App.3d at pp. 118-119.)</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">Thus, given the state of the appellate record, we cannot credit appellants\u2019 extensive attacks on the factual findings and conclusions of Judge Choate\u2019s statement of decision (to which appellants did not object and to which they failed to contribute despite the grant of a requested time extension in which to do so). We must and do conclude that the statement of decision was supported by the evidence presented. That statement fully supports the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"995\">*995</page-number>Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">The judgment is affirmed.

However, counsel for all parties, including specifically counsel for both Eleanor and Highlands, executed a written stipulation waiving any potential conflict on or about February 10, 1995. Nonetheless, Eleanor asserted at oral argument that she never consented to the execution of such waiver by her attorney. The record does reflect that Eleanor had expressed an objection to the representation of the respondent special administrator by Kahn, Stern &amp; Blaney in a declaration which was prepared and filed on or about September 4, 1992, by her then counsel, Bruce E. Schwartz. Thus, Mr. Schwartz is presumed to have had actual knowledge at that time of Eleanor\u2019s objection. Therefore, his subsequent execution of the stipulation in February 1995, waiving the potential conflict, was presumably done with Eleanor\u2019s approval. Certainly, knowing of such earlier objection Mr. Schwartz could not have properly executed such waiver on Eleanor\u2019s behalf without her consent. Given this state of the record, Judge Choate and the other parties and their counsel could reasonably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"978\">*978</page-number>rely on the representation by Mr. Schwartz, which is necessarily implied by his signature on the waiver, that he had obtained such consent. In any event, we view an attorney\u2019s approval of his client\u2019s waiver of a potential conflict with the client\u2019s prior attorney as falling within the substantive rule that the lawyer must be authorized by the client to execute the waiver but, if such authority in fact was not given, the nature of this waiver is <em>not </em>so substantial that the remedy for the failure to obtain <em>actual </em>client authority should be the setting aside of the agreement. (See <em>In re Marriage of Helsel </em>(1988) 198 Cal.App.3d 332, 337-338 [243 Cal.Rptr. 657]; see also <em>Blanton </em>v. <em>Womancare, Inc. </em>(1985) 38 Cal.3d 396, 406-407 [212 Cal.Rptr. 151, 696 P.2d 645, 48 A.L.R.4th 109].) In such circumstances, \u201cthe opposing party may continue to enforce the agreement [i.e., the waiver] against the client but the client then has recourse against the lawyer for acting in excess of his [or her] authority.\u201d <em>[In re Marriage of Helsel, supra, </em>198 Cal.App.3d at p. 338.) Finally, no argument is made by any party herein that such written waiver, executed by counsel for all parties, is not a valid and binding waiver, at least as between the parties. For all of these reasons, we do not believe that Eleanor\u2019s current objections are an impediment to enforcement of the judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b686-8\">In a letter to the mother of the heirs dated January 28, 1992, Eleanor announced her intention to resign as administrator, effective March 1, 1992. She explained her reasons for this decision in'terms which reflect some of the family acrimony which has developed in this matter: \u201cDuring the past fifteen months that I have served as administratrix for the Estate of my late brother, Theodore, I have done what I could to maintain the Estate intact without allowing properties to go into foreclosure and other assets to be seized by the banks, [\u00b6] To say the least, it has taken an heroic effort on my part and a lot of forbearance to endure the constant demands for money by creditors, repairs by city agencies and irate tenants, insults, and threats against my safety and person, not to mention the extensive hours of my time, and expenditures of my own personal resources to keep the Estate afloat. [\u00b6] I have endured a great deal of personal, emotional and financial sacrifice in carrying out these duties. For the latter, I have received some appreciation from you and your son, Preston. From [Zjamahl], the second heir, I have received nothing more than curses, idiotic demands, ungrounded accusations, threats, and absolutely no cooperation. [\u00b6] The last threat of a law suit against me, assumedly because I asked him to take over the management of the property, a job which I have carried out without any compensation to this point, and a responsibility I have assumed in spite of the fact that both he and Preston refused to sign an agreement granting me both the authorization to do so and promise of remuneration, is the last straw.\u201d She closed out this letter with a specific warning which apparently referred to litigation threats which she had received: \u201cPlease be forewarned: Any attempts to hold me personally liable for any matters regarding the Estate of my brother, Theodore, which have been beyond my control will be countered to the fullest extent of the law at my access. Both the Estate and all individual litigants will be named as defendants for a rather substantial sum which may very well exceed any settlement either of the heirs receives at the end of the probate of the Estate.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b687-7\">As of April 10, 1992, the real and personal property was described in the court\u2019s order as: \u201c[1] 1990 Lexus automobile; [\u00b6] [2] Real property commonly known as 4040 Coco Street, City of Los Angeles, California; [3] 20 unit apartment house located at 4709 August Street, Los Angeles, California; [4] 8 unit apartment house located at 4808 and 4816 August Street, City of Los Angeles, California; and [\u00b6] [5] Improved real property commonly known as 582 Garth Avenue, Los Angeles, California.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b687-9\">Zjamahl\u2019s petition for the issuance of the order to show cause alleged that Eleanor not only had failed to comply with the April 10 order requiring her to file a balanced account, but also that she had purposefully and wilfully evaded service of citation documents and had wilfully disobeyed subpena duces tecum to appear and produce essential estate documents.

She failed to do so. \u201cAs a direct result of Ms. Fain\u2019s uncooperative behavior, mismanagement and waste of estate assets, failure to turn over estate records in a timely manner, failure to properly account, failure to marshall all estate assets, failure to sell and/or liquidate estate assets in a timely manner, the administration of the estate was unduly prolonged to the detriment of the estate and resulted in unnecessary administrative costs and fees. \u201cWhen Ms. Fain failed to comply with the court order requiring her to account, Zjamahl Fain, petitioned the court to compel Ms. Fain to account and sought surcharges through their petition and also orally under [Probate Code] 1043(b) against Ms. Fain. The surcharge request was based on Ms. Fain\u2019s breach of fiduciary duties in her capacity as estate administrator to use ordinary care and diligence in managing and controlling the estate, for misfeasance, malfeasance, negligence, negligent failure to act, mismanagement of estate assets, failure to inspect estate property, failure to liquidate assets to pay estate debts, waste, mismanagement, wrongfully neglecting the estate, failure to collect estate debts, compromising claims without court approval, lost profits and bad faith failure to account to the court for over four years from the date of the court order requiring her to do so. <em>\u201cSeveral voluntary settlement conferences failed to yield results and the case was ordered out to a trial by a judge sitting pro tempore as confirmed by probate notes with all parties stipulating that the matter was to be heard by The Honorable Raymond. Choate. </em>\u201cIt was four years from the time that Ms. Fain was ordered by the court to file an accounting that she filed a balanced accounting. Even this was not done until the first day of trial. However, even this accounting failed to make a complete and full report of administration. \u201cThe only evidence presented by Eleanor Fain in support of her position was testimony from her mother, her aunt, her brother, a prior boyfriend who said he made repairs to the property and one of the property managers. The court finds that this evidence was insufficient to establish that there had been no breach of fiduciary duty.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b693-13\">The judgment provided, in relevant part: \u201cIt Is Ordered, Adjudged and Decreed That: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"986\">*986</page-number>\u201c1. $715,000 plus interest at 10% is awarded to the Estate of Theodore Fain, decedent, against Eleanor J.
