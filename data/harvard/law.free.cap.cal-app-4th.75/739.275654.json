J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aut\">On March 21, 1996, fire destroyed a New Orleans warehouse causing millions of dollars of damage. The sums involved are large but the issue here is simple\u2014whether that loss is to be borne by one insurer or allocated between two insurers whose policies have competing \u201cother insurance\u201d provisions. We hold that the amount of loss must be prorated between the insurers.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-11\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b490-12\">New Orleans municipal authorities leased a plot of unimproved land to West Coast Liquidators, Inc. (West Coast). Sometime after West Coast built the warehouse and went into possession, it sold and assigned all of its \u201cright, title and interest\u201d under the master lease with the municipal authorities to TriNet Corporate Realty Trust, Inc. (TriNet). Simultaneously TriNet leased the premises back to West Coast. At the time of the fire West Coast was covered by a policy of insurance issued by Commerce &amp; Industry Insurance Company (Commerce), while TriNet had a policy from Chubb Custom Insurance Company (Chubb). On behalf of West Coast, Commerce paid $57.5 million to the municipal authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-13\">The Commerce policy included a liability limit of $60 million and was effective for the year commencing October 1, 1995. The policy included this provision: \u201cOther Insurance\u2014The Company shall not be liable for loss, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>if, at the time of loss there is any other insurance which would attach if this insurance had not been effected, except that this insurance shall apply only as excess and in no event as contributing insurance, and then only after all other insurance has been exhausted in the payment of. . . [a covered] loss.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">The Chubb policy had a maximum liability limit of $41,215,000 for the warehouse property for the calendar year 1996. It included a similar provision: \u201cOther Insurance\u2014If you have other insurance against a loss covered by this policy, we shall not be liable for a greater proportion of the loss than the applicable Limit of Insurance under this policy bears to the total applicable Limit of Insurance of all insurance against the loss.\u201d The policy also had this provision: \u201cContingent Coverage\u2014This insurance covers only in the absence of any other collectible insurance. At the time of loss, if there is any other insurance covering the property insured hereunder which in the absence of this insurance would cover the loss or damage hereunder covered, then the company shall not be liable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">The master lease with the New Orleans municipal authorities obligated West Coast to maintain a policy of property insurance. It also provided that the leasehold interest could be assigned, but the municipal authorities would have to approve in writing and the assignee would have to \u201ccomply with all terms and conditions of this Lease\u201d and the lessee would still \u201cremain primarily liable for all of the obligations contained in this Lease.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">Taking the position that these provisions made both West Coast and TriNet responsible for securing insurance for the warehouse and that therefore Chubb was in effect a joint insurer, Commerce initiated this action for equitable contribution, equitable indemnity, and declaratory relief. The gist of the complaint was that Chubb had paid nothing when in fact it was equitably obligated by reason of the respective policies\u2019 liability limits to shoulder 40.7 percent of the total loss, or approximately $23.4 million. Both parties moved for summary judgment. The trial court granted Chubb\u2019s motion and denied that of Commerce. Commerce perfected this timely appeal from the judgment entered in due course.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-9\">Review</p>\n<p id=\"b491-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b491-11\">The policy provisions quoted above straddle three categories.  Insurance policies commonly include \u201cother insurance\u201d provisions which \u201cattempt to limit the insurer\u2019s liability to the extent that other insurance covers the same risk.\u201d (Croskey et al., Cal. Practice Guide: Insurance Litigation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>(The Rutter Group 1997) \u00b6 8:10, p. 8-2 rev. #1 1998.) One subcategory is known as \u201cpro rata\u201d provisions, which look to limit the insurer\u2019s liability to \u201cthe total proportion that its policy limits bear to the total coverage available to the insured.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>\u00b6\u00b6 8:15 to 8:16, p. 8-4.) There is another subcategory known as \u201cexcess only\u201d clauses, which require the exhaustion of other insurance; in effect, this insurer does not provide primary coverage but only acts as an excess insurer. <em>(Id., </em>\u00b6 8:19, p. 8-5.) A final subcategory of \u201cescape\u201d clauses extinguishes the insurer\u2019s liability if the loss is covered by other insurance. <em>(Id., </em>\u00b6 8:20, p. 8-5; see generally, <em>Olympic Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Employers Surplus Lines Ins. Co. </em>(1981) 126 Cal.App.3d 593, 598 [178 Cal.Rptr. 908].)</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">The provisions of both policies have an element of the pure escape clause. Beyond this generality, Commerce\u2019s \u201cother insurance\u201d provision starts off sounding like an escape clause but then declares itself to be an excess only clause; its \u201cin no event as contributing insurance\u201d language appears to exclude characterization as a pro rata clause. Chubb\u2019s provisions are very different. Its \u201cother insurance\u201d provision is clearly a pro rata clause.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">\u201cEscape\u201d clauses came to be so named because they permit an insurer to make a seemingly ironclad guarantee of coverage, only to withdraw that coverage (and thus escape liability) in the presence of other insurance. (See, e.g., <em>CSE Ins. Group </em>v. <em>Northbrook Property &amp; Casualty Co. </em>(1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 1839, 1845 [29 Cal.Rptr.2d 120] and decisions cited.) When \u201cexcess only\u201d clauses are found in primary liability policies, they are treated the same way as escape clauses. (E.g., <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Maryland Casualty Co. </em>(1998) 65 Cal.App.4th 1279, 1305 [77 Cal.Rptr.2d 296]; <em>Olympic Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Employers Surplus Lines Ins. Co., supra, </em>126 Cal.App.3d 593, 599.) Because these types of provisions are disfavored, courts have developed a method of overriding them\u2014\u201cWhen two or more applicable policies contain such clauses, both liability and the costs of defense should ordinarily be prorated according to the amount of coverage afforded.\u201d <em>(Argonaut Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Transport Indem. Co. </em>(1972) 6 Cal.3d 496, 507-508 [99 Cal.Rptr. 617, 492 P.2d 673] [escape clauses]; see <em>Fire Ins. Exchange </em>v. <em>American States Ins. Co. </em>(1995) 39 Cal.App.4th 653, 659 [46 Cal.Rptr.2d 135] [excess only clauses].) The reason for this rule is that the conflicting provisions are deemed essentially irreconcilable; if given effect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>competing clauses would strand an insured between insurers disclaiming coverage in a manner reminiscent of Alphonse and Gaston. (See <em>Employers Reinsurance Corp. </em>v. <em>Phoenix Ins. Co. </em>(1986) 186 Cal.App.3d 545, 557 [230 Cal.Rptr. 792] [\u201cIf we were to give effect to all. . . clauses in this instance, they would cancel each other out and afford the insured no coverage whatsoever. We would travel full circle with no place to say \u2018the buck stops here.\u2019 \u201d]; <em>Continental Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>Pacific Indemnity Co., supra, </em>134 Cal.App.3d 389, 397.) Courts have found for the pro rata solution when confronted by a variety of conflicts between differing types of \u201cother insurance\u201d provisions. (See Croskey et al., Cal. Practice Guide: Insurance Litigation, <em>supra, \u00b6\u00b6 </em>8:26 to 8:38, pp. 8-6 to 8-9; see generally, 8A Appleman on Insurance (rev. ed. 1981) \u00a7\u00a7 4906-4910; 16 Couch on Insurance (2d ed. 1983) \u00a7\u00a7 62:30, 62:71-62:83, pp. 460-461, 528-560.)</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">A predicate for prorating policies with conflicting \u201cother insurance\u201d provisions is that the policies operate on the same level of coverage, that is to say, two or more policies apply to the same damage or loss suffered by the same party. (See, e.g., <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Maryland Casualty Co., supra, </em>65 Cal.App.4th 1279, 1304; <em>Pines of La Jolla Homeowners Assn. </em>v. <em>Industrial Indemnity </em>(1992) 5 Cal.App.4th 714, 723 [7 Cal.Rptr.2d 53].) Put another way, \u201c[a]n \u2018other insurance\u2019 dispute can only arise between carriers on the same level, it cannot arise between excess and primary insurers.\u201d <em>(North River Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>American Home Assurance Co. </em>(1989) 210 Cal.App.3d 108, 114 [257 Cal.Rptr. 129].)</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">This was the approach taken by Chubb to avoid any responsibility for the loss. It sought summary judgment on the ground that its policy provided \u201ccontingent coverage and was not intended to be primary insurance on the property.\u201d The \u201ccontingent coverage\u201d provision of its policy was not a true \u201cother insurance\u201d clause but merely a modification of \u201cthe extent of coverage\u201d of the policy. To support this construction Chubb submitted declarations by two of its underwriters and TriNet\u2019s insurance manager. The gist of these declarations was that Chubb and TriNet intended that the Chubb policy was not intended to provide primary coverage but only \u201ccontingent\u201d (i.e., excess) coverage. These materials persuaded the trial court: \u201cThe facts demonstrate that Commerce . . . and Chubb are not co-insurers of the same loss. The Court finds that the . . . [policies] . . . have different insureds, different risks, different premiums and are different types of insurance policies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>We are not persuaded. Such extrinsic evidence as was produced by Chubb may be relevant to insurer-insured disputes about ambiguous policy language, but it cannot be used to substantiate unexpressed intention and thereby vary clear and explicit contract provisions. (E.g., <em>Bank of the West </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 1254, 1264-1265 [10 Cal.Rptr.2d 538, 833 P.2d 545]; <em>Shaw </em>v. <em>Regents of University of California </em>(1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 44, 55 [67 Cal.Rptr.2d 850]; <em>Berman </em>v. <em>Bromberg </em>(1997) 56 Cal.App.4th 936, 948 [65 Cal.Rptr.2d 777]; <em>Pieper </em>v. <em>Commercial Underwriters Ins. Co. </em>(1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 1008, 1016 [69 Cal.Rptr.2d 551]; see also <em>Signal Companies, Inc. </em>v. <em>Harbor Ins. Co. </em>(1980) 27 Cal.3d 359, 369 [165 Cal.Rptr. 799, 612 P.2d 889, 19 A.L.R.4th 75], quoted <em>post.) </em>The policy language here is very clear and inhospitable to the construction Chubb wishes to engraft upon it.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">Chubb\u2019s policy was for \u201cCommercial Property Insurance.\u201d It expressly listed the warehouse as covered property. The named insured was TriNet, which was insured against \u201cphysical loss or damage\u201d caused by specified causes, including fire. The policy thus meets the definition of primary coverage\u2014the insurer\u2019s liability arises immediately upon occurrence of a covered loss (e.g., <em>North River Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>American Home Assurance Co., supra, </em>210 Cal.App.3d 108, 112; <em>Olympic Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Employers Surplus Lines Ins. Co., supra, </em>126 Cal.App.3d 593, 599)\u2014and fails to display the indicia of a true excess or umbrella policy, such as much briefer length or specific identification of the primary coverage policy or other policy language. (See Croskey et al., Cal. Practice Guide: Insurance Litigation, <em>supra, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 8:75 to 8:83.1, pp. 8-29 to 8-32; <em>Coca Cola Bottling Co. </em>v. <em>Columbia Casualty Ins. Co. </em>(1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 1176, 1182-1183 [14 Cal.Rptr.2d 643].) The few scattered references to \u201ccontingent property\u201d and the \u201ccontingent coverage\u201d provision quoted above, will not suffice to transmute what is obviously a policy for primary coverage.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">Chubb\u2019s attempt to prove that its policy is merely \u201ccontingent\u201d or excess to the Commerce policy is unavailing. The fact that the policies have different insureds proves nothing.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Neither policy lists as named insureds the New Orleans municipal authorities, yet there can be no dispute that those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>authorities, as the owner of the warehouse, would be the ultimate beneficiary of the insurance the master lease requires to be maintained. (See <em>Alexander </em>v. <em>Security-First Nat. Bank </em>(1936) 7 Cal.2d 718, 723-724 [62 P.2d 735] [owner would have equitable lien on insurance proceeds if contractually required insurance payable to other persons]; 6 Miller &amp; Starr, Current Law of Cal. Real Estate (2d ed. 1989) Landlord and Tenant, \u00a7 18:81, pp. 194, 197.) If TriNet breached the obligation to obtain insurance it assumed with the assignment of the lease, or if West Coast breached the same obligation in its lease with TriNet, the municipal authorities would have had a cause of action. (E.g., <em>Hartman Ranch Co. </em>v. <em>Associated Oil Co. </em>(1937) 10 Cal.2d 232, 244-245 [73 P.2d 1163].) The policies would not insure the municipal authorities\u2019 property, but the distinct interests of West Coast and TriNet that were independently insurable. (E.g., <em>Russell </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1962) 58 Cal.2d 487, 490 [24 Cal.Rptr. 859, 374 P.2d 827]; <em>Alexander </em>v. <em>Security-First Nat. Bank, supra, </em>at pp. 722-723.) As has already been shown, the two policies do cover the same risk\u2014loss by fire. And the fact that both provide general insurance points to their overlapping coverage. (See Croskey et al., <em>supra, </em>\u00b6 8:14, p. 8-4.) Nor is the matter of different premiums important, given that setting premiums is a notoriously imprecise and individualized proposition.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (See 19 Appleman on Insurance, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 10501, 10503; 5 Couch on Insurance (3d ed. 1997) \u00a7\u00a7 69:1-69:3, pp. 69-5 to 69-12.) Accordingly, we cannot sustain the trial court\u2019s conclusions that these \u201care different types of insurance policies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">Nor are we impressed by Chubb\u2019s argument (made in support of its summary judgment motion but unmentioned in the order granting that motion) that it is not a primary insurer by virtue of a provision in the West Coast-TriNet lease requiring West Coast \u201cat its sole cost and expense\u201d to \u201cobtain and continuously maintain in full force and effect . . . \u2018All-Risk\u2019 policies of property insurance. . . .\u201d Our rejection has two grounds. First, we are construing the policies issued by Commerce and Chubb and, as previously established, extrinsic evidence such as the West Coast-TriNet lease agreement cannot constitute proof of intent unexpressed in the policies. Second, the argument is unpersuasive on its merits. There is nothing in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>record which demonstrates either that TriNet did not assume all of the obligations of West Coast\u2019s master lease with the municipal authorities\u2014 including the obligation to maintain insurance\u2014or that the municipal authorities released TriNet from that obligation in their written consent to the assignment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (E.g., <em>Hartman Ranch Co. </em>v. <em>Associated Oil Co., supra, </em>10 Cal.2d 232, 244-245; <em>German-American Sav. Bank </em>v. <em>Gollmer </em>(1909) 155 Cal. 683, 688 [102 P. 932]; 6 Miller &amp; Starr, Current Law of Cal. Real Estate, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 18:54, p. 113 and decisions cited.)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">Having established that Commerce and Chubb must both be regarded as primary insurers, we come then to the dispositive issue\u2014how are the conflicting \u201cother insurance\u201d provisions in the policies to be handled? We start with the actual provisions in the policies. (See <em>Employers Reinsurance Corp. </em>v. <em>Phoenix Ins. Co., supra, </em>186 Cal.App.3d 545, 556.)</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">As previously shown, Commerce\u2019s provision is in plain effect an excess only clause, while the Chubb provisions are a hybrid pro rata/escape clause. If the Commerce provision is given literal effect, the positions of the parties would be reversed\u2014Chubb would be the primary insurer up to its policy limit of $41,215,000, and Commerce would provide excess coverage for the remaining loss of $16,285,000.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Chubb\u2019s \u201ccontingent coverage\u201d clause, if given a literal reading, would allow Chubb to escape from any liability because there was other coverage in the form of the Commerce policy, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>that coverage was sufficient to pay for the entire loss. On the other hand, that and the \u201cother insurance\u201d provision hold out the prospect of Chubb acting as excess insurer, but only for a pro rata amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">If the policies\u2019 language is of little assistance, it is helpful to understand the broader context. \u201c \u2018The reciprocal rights and duties of several insurers who have covered the same event do not arise out of contract, for their agreements are not with each other .... Their respective obligations flow from equitable principles designed to accomplish ultimate justice in the bearing of a specific burden. As these principles do not stem from agreement between the insurers their application is not controlled by the language of their contracts with the respective policy holders.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Signal Companies, Inc. </em>v. <em>Harbor Ins. Co., supra, </em>27 Cal.3d 359, 369.) The original source of this quote noted that equity \u201coverrides the terms of the insurance policies.\u201d <em>(Amer. Auto. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Seaboard Surety Co. </em>(1957) 155 Cal.App.2d 192, 197 [318 P.2d 84].)</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">The precedents in this area, as this court recently observed in <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Maryland Casualty Co., supra, </em>65 Cal.App.4th 1279, 1305, are numerous and not easily harmonized. The task of harmonization is aided by the spadework already performed by the author of a leading treatise. This commentator demonstrates that there is authority that an excess only clause will prevail over either a pro rata clause or an escape clause\u2014in either case the excess only policy will not be viewed as providing primary coverage\u2014but the recent trend is to prorate the loss between the carriers. (Croskey et al., Cal. Practice Guide: Insurance Litigation, <em>supra, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 8:27-8:29, pp. 8-6 - 8-7; see the decisions compiled in <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Maryland Casualty Co., supra, </em>at pp. 1305-1306; <em>CSE Ins. Group </em>v. <em>Northbrook Property &amp; Casualty Co., supra, </em>23 Cal.App.4th 1839, 1843-1844; and <em>Employers Reinsurance Corp. </em>v. <em>Mission Equities Corp. </em>(1977) 74 Cal.App.3d 826, 831 [141 Cal.Rptr. 727]; see also fn. 7, <em>ante.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">Commerce is entitled to the pro rata allocation it requested. Not only is that the approach endorsed by this court just last year in <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund,</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark><em> </em>it also strikes us as the result that will most accurately reflect the equities. It was Commerce who stood by the insured from the start. It never tried to disclaim responsibility. Only after its duty to its insured was satisfied did Commerce try to recover from Chubb, and even then the amount of contribution it sought was not excessive. (See fn. 7, <em>ante.) </em>Finally, we detect a note <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>of legislative preference for prorating this loss. (See Ins. Code, \u00a7 591 [\u201cIn case of double insurance . . . . [\u00b6] (a) In fire insurance, each insurer shall contribute ratably . . . .\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">The summary judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded to the trial court with directions to enter judgment for Commerce in the amount of $23,404,500.

(See <em>Continental Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>Pacific Indemnity Co. </em>(1982) 134 Cal.App.3d 389 [184 Cal.Rptr. 583] [characterizing equivalent provisions as \u201ccomposite\u201d clauses]; <em>Peerless Cas.

It too is a \u201cCommercial Property Contract\u201d that covers loss from \u201call risks\u201d including fire. It also covers the New Orleans property, although not nearly so explicitly as the Chubb policy. Both the Commerce and the Chubb policies cover all property of a specific (and different) named insured.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b494-8\">Interestingly enough, the West Coast-TriNet purchase agreement obligated to maintain TriNet as \u201can additional insured\u201d on the policies West Coast would obtain and maintain and the West Coast-TriNet lease had a similar provision specifying that the insurance \u201cshall be for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>the benefit of [the] Landlord [TriNet] (as an additional insured and loss payee) . . . .\u201d Obviously, had TriNet corrected West Coast\u2019s noncompliance with these requirements, the argument Chubb now makes would have considerably less force.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b495-10\">To cite just some of the possible variables in this case, Commerce is a New York insurer, Chubb is incorporated in Delaware, and the two states may have very different methods of calculating or approving premium rates. In addition, the Commerce policy may be wider in scope\u2014i.e., with a greater number of named insureds and insured locations\u2014than is the Chubb policy, which could certainly be pertinent in explaining a premium differential. The course of dealings between the insurers and their respective insureds may have some bearing on the premiums charged, but this remains a matter of speculation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b496-8\">All the record does include is an unexecuted \u201cEstoppel Certificate and Agreement\u201d from the municipal authorities that is attached as an exhibit to the West Coast-TriNet purchase agreement. This form includes a recital that the municipal authorities \u201chereby grant their consent and approval for, and no other consent or approval ... for (1) the Company [i.e., West Coast] to transfer its interest in the Master Lease to TriNet, (2) TriNet to lease its interests to the Company . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b496-9\">The purchase agreement and the lease executed by West Coast and TriNet each includes a provision specifying that it would be governed by the law of Louisiana. Neither Commerce nor Chubb has ever invoked these provisions, meaning any choice of law problem has been waived. (E.g., <em>Hurtado </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 574, 581 [114 Cal.Rptr. 106, 522 P.2d 666].) Insofar as the purchase agreement and lease are relevant to this litigation, they shall be judged by California law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b496-10\">There is a line of authority which holds that in a situation with multiple primary coverages where one policy has an \u201cexcess only\u201d clause and another policy with a \u201cpro rata\u201d clause, the former will be given effect and the latter will be treated as providing primary coverage. (See <em>Donahue Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>Transport Indem. Co. </em>(1970) 7 Cal.App.3d 291, 302-303 [86 Cal.Rptr. 632] and decisions cited.) Actual application of this principle is, as we recently noted, subject to the proviso that \u201cthe rights of the policyholder are not adversely affected.\u201d <em>(Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Maryland Casualty Co., supra, </em>65 Cal.App.4th 1279, 1294, fn. 4.) Although the proviso is clearly satisfied here, Commerce has not chosen to invoke the principle. We are awarding Commerce exactly what it asked for in its complaint\u2014\u201cjudgment against defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>Chubb Custom Insurance Company for the amount of $23,404,500.00 pursuant to the doctrine[] of equitable contribution . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b497-10\">And followed by the recent decision in <em>American Continental Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>American Casualty Co. </em>(1999) 73 Cal.App.4th 508 [86 Cal.Rptr.2d 560], which dealt with a similar \u201cexcess only\u201d versus \u201cpro rata\u201d clash of policy provisions.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
