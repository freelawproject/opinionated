J.</author>\n<p id=\"ArQ\">Russell Masaji Kodani appeals from a judgment denying his petition for writ of mandate, which sought to overturn the suspension of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>his driver\u2019s license by the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV). Appellant\u2019s license was suspended because he was driving with an excessive blood-alcohol content. Contrary to appellant\u2019s contention, there was reasonable cause to stop his vehicle based on the arresting officer\u2019s observation that appellant was not wearing his seat belt.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">On January 22, 1998, at approximately 2:00 a.m., California Highway Patrol (CHP) Officer T. A. Snyder observed appellant driving while not wearing his seat belt and thus in violation of the law mandating seat belt use.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As indicated in the officer\u2019s written report submitted to the DMV, the officer was driving his CHP patrol vehicle north on Topanga Canyon Boulevard and preparing to make a right turn onto Victory Boulevard when he observed appellant\u2019s 1989 blue Honda CRX stopped at the traffic light and headed west on Victory Boulevard. Officer Snyder noticed appellant was \u201cnot wearing his seat belt.\u201d The officer drove behind appellant\u2019s vehicle. As appellant entered the intersection, the officer activated his patrol car\u2019s lights, and appellant pulled over to the side of the road.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">Appellant had bloodshot eyes, an odor of alcoholic beverage, an unsteady gait and slurred speech. He failed several field sobriety coordination tests. Appellant also twice blew into a preliminary alcohol screening device, and registered 0.14 percent and 0.12 percent blood-alcohol content on the two preliminary tests.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The officer arrested appellant for driving under the influence of alcohol (Veh. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 23152, 23153), and took him to the Van Nuys jail where he submitted to breath tests to determine his actual blood-alcohol content. Two tests each revealed a blood-alcohol content of 0.12 percent, well in excess of the legal limit of 0.08 percent. Officer Snyder then processed an administrative suspension of appellant\u2019s driver\u2019s license and issued him a temporary driver\u2019s license. (See Veh. Code, \u00a7 13353.2.)</p>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">Appellant requested and received a hearing before the DMV and contested the basis for the suspension of his driver\u2019s license. He was represented by counsel, who submitted a letter brief asserting various evidentiary objections and legal arguments. A telephonic hearing was held. The DMV received into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>evidence, over appellant\u2019s objections, Officer Snyder\u2019s sworn statement, the officer\u2019s arrest report and the breath test results revealing appellant\u2019s blood-alcohol content. Appellant presented no testimony or any other evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">The DMV hearing officer\u2019s findings and decision upheld the suspension of appellant\u2019s driver\u2019s license. The hearing officer found that there was sufficient evidence Officer Snyder had reasonable cause to believe appellant was driving a motor vehicle in violation of Vehicle Code section 23152 or 23153, appellant was placed under lawful arrest, and appellant was driving the vehicle while he had a blood-alcohol content in excess of the legal limit of 0.08 percent.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">Thereafter, appellant filed a petition for a writ of mandate challenging the administrative order. (See Veh. Code, \u00a7 13559; Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1094.5.) The superior court found that the arresting officer\u2019s uncontradicted statement that he observed appellant not wearing a seat belt constituted reasonable cause to detain appellant, that the weight of the evidence supported the DMV\u2019s findings, and that the DMV\u2019s decision to suspend appellant\u2019s driver\u2019s license was proper. The court denied the petition for writ of mandate and issued judgment in favor of respondent DMV.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">Appellant contends that the superior court erred in finding lawful his initial detention for a seat belt violation in concluding his ensuing arrest for driving while under the influence of alcohol was proper. Specifically, appellant reasons that the basis for the traffic stop was his violation of the law requiring that the operator of a motor vehicle be \u201crestrained by a safety belt\u201d (Veh. Code, \u00a7 27315, subd. (d)); that the Legislature has used, as purportedly synonymous, the terms \u201cseat belt,\u201d \u201csafety belt,\u201d and \u201clap belt,\u201d and distinguished them from the term \u201cshoulder harness\u201d; that the law requires a driver to use a shoulder harness, as distinguished from a lap-style safety belt, only if the vehicle is equipped with such a shoulder harness as standard equipment; that the arresting officer should have included information that the vehicle was equipped with a shoulder harness observed by him not to be in use; and that the arresting officer\u2019s statement appellant was not wearing a \u201cseat belt\u201d meant only he was not wearing a lap-style safety belt, which the officer could not have observed from his vantage point in the patrol car. Appellant thus concludes there was no basis for the initial stop because the arresting officer could not have seen a lap belt, and there was no evidence the officer observed a shoulder harness installed on the vehicle but not being used by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">Appellant\u2019s reasoning is flawed in several regards. Appellant\u2019s major premise is that when the officer stopped him because he was not wearing a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>\u201cseat belt,\u201d the officer must have meant appellant was not wearing a lap-style belt. To the contrary, common sense, as well as our interpretation of relevant statutes, leads to the conclusion that the terms \u201cseat belt\u201d and \u201csafety belt\u201d have similar broad meanings, which include the configuration of both a \u201clap belt\u201d and \u201cshoulder harness\u201d combination, or just a \u201clap belt.\u201d Absent any evidence to the contrary, the most reasonable interpretation of the arresting officer\u2019s reference to a \u201cseat belt\u201d is to the current and most prevalent configuration\u2014a \u201clap belt\u201d and \u201cshoulder harness\u201d combination, with the latter component often easily observed from an adjacent oncoming vehicle.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">The Legislature has not specifically defined any of the seat belt terminology at issue. However, \u201cWords and phrases are construed according to the context and the approved usage of the language; but technical words and phrases, and such others as may have acquired a peculiar and appropriate meaning in law ... are to be construed according to such peculiar and appropriate meaning or definition.\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7 13.) The seat belt terminology here does not involve technical words with meanings peculiar to the law. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Kimbrel </em>(1981) 120 Cal.App.3d 869, 872 [174 Cal.Rptr. 816], citing examples of \u201c \u2018commonly understood\u2019 \u201d words with no \u201c \u2018technical meaning peculiar to the law.\u2019 \u201d) We thus look to the context and approved usage of the language.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">In the legislative context, the Motor Vehicle Safety Act (Veh. Code, \u00a7 27315), which mandates the use of seat belts, uses the terms \u201cseatbelt\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and \u201csafety belt\u201d interchangeably and without distinction.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Such fungible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>treatment of the two terms in the statute acknowledges the parallel meaning of the terms in common <footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">Other related legislation is also instructive. Car dealers are required to post warnings on used passenger vehicles (model years 1972 to 1990) admonishing buyers that despite the benefits of the \u201cuse of all seat belts,\u201d there are potential dangers in using \u201clap-only belts,\u201d and \u201cshoulder harnesses\u201d may be available which can be retrofitted in the vehicle. (Veh. Code, \u00a7 27314.5, subds. (a)(1), (b)(1).) The statute thus uses the term \u201clap belt\u201d as a type of \u201cseat belt,\u201d and refers to more than one type of seat belt (i.e., <em>\u201call </em>seat belts\u201d). Accordingly, the statute implies that a \u201cshoulder harness\u201d used with a \u201clap belt\u201d is another type of \u201cseat belt,\u201d and such a configuration is therefore within the broader and more inclusive category of \u201cseat belt\u201d or \u201csafety belt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\"> In the present case, when the officer saw appellant \u201cnot wearing his seat belt,\u201d he had reasonable cause to stop him; i.e., a reasonable suspicion that appellant had been or was about to be involved in some criminal activity.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Place </em>(1983) 462 U.S. 696, 702 [103 S.Ct. 2637, 2641-2642, 77 L.Ed.2d 110].)  \u201cIt is settled that circumstances short of probable cause to make an arrest may justify a police officer stopping and briefly detaining a person for questioning or other limited investigation. [Citations.] . . . The guiding principle ... is \u2018the reasonableness in all the circumstances of the particular governmental invasion of a citizen\u2019s personal security.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(In re Tony C. </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 888, 892 [148 Cal.Rptr. 366, 582 P.2d 957], fn. omitted.) Even if the circumstances are as consistent with lawful activity as with criminal activity, the officer may still rightfully \u201cinquire into such circumstances \u2018in the proper discharge of the officer\u2019s duties.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 894.) \u201cThe possibility of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>innocent explanation does not deprive the officer of the capacity to entertain a reasonable suspicion of criminal conduct.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">Contrary to appellant\u2019s assertion, the arresting officer was not required to have an intimate knowledge of the make, model and year of appellant\u2019s vehicle and the safety restraint system in that particular vehicle before concluding that a shoulder harness was installed in the vehicle but not in use by appellant. It may well be that some cars are of such antique vintage that an officer would not reasonably expect to find a shoulder harness in them. In such an uncommon situation, the absence from sight of a shoulder harness would not reasonably imply a violation of the mandatory seat belt law and could not support a lawful stop of the vehicle. But such was not the case with appellant\u2019s 1989 Honda CRX. Even, in cases where the nature of the vehicle renders it reasonably uncertain whether a shoulder harness would be installed, the officer is entitled, pursuant to <em>In re Tony C., supra, 21 </em>Cal.3d 888, to stop the vehicle and resolve the uncertainty to determine if the mandatory seat belt law has been violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">Accordingly, \u201cresolv[ing] all evidentiary conflicts and draw[ing] all legitimate and reasonable inferences in favor of the trial court\u2019s decision\u201d <em>(Yordamlis </em>v. <em>Zolin </em>(1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 655, 659 [14 Cal.Rptr.2d 225]), substantial evidence supports the trial court\u2019s judgment and its conclusion that there was reasonable cause to detain and then to arrest appellant and that the weight of the evidence supports the DMV\u2019s suspension order. <em>(Bell </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles </em>(1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 304, 309 [13 Cal.Rptr.2d 830]; <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles </em>(1980) 107 Cal.App.3d 354, 358 [165 Cal.Rptr. 626].)</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-9\">Nott, J., and Mallano, J.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b365-9\">Vehicle Code section 27315, subdivision (d)(1), provides that but for several limited statutory exceptions, inapplicable here, \u201cNo person shall operate a motor vehicle on a highway unless that person and all passengers 16 years of age or over are properly restrained by a safety belt.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b365-10\">The preliminary alcohol screening test is not determinative of blood-alcohol content, but is a field sobriety test which may be used as a further investigative tool in order to establish reasonable cause to believe a person was driving a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol.

(10th ed. 1995) p. 1054; Oxford English Dict. (2d ed. CD-ROM 1994); Webster\u2019s Third New Internat. Dict. (1981) p. 2049). Vehicle Code section 27315 uses \u201cseatbelt\u201d (one word), but another relevant statute (\u00a7 27314.5) refers to \u201cseat belt\u201d (two words). Also, the Code of Federal Regulations refers variously to both usages. Given the inconsistency in the statutes and regulations, we will follow the dictionary preference in all instances in this opinion except when quoting directly from a statute or regulation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b367-9\">Vehicle Code section 27315, subdivision (a), provides as follows: \u201cThe Legislature finds that a mandatory <em>seatbelt </em>law will contribute to reducing highway deaths and injuries by encouraging greater usage of existing manual <em>seatbelts, </em>that automatic crash protection systems which require no action by vehicle occupants offer the best hope of reducing deaths and injuries, and that encouraging the use of manual <em>safety belts </em>is only a partial remedy for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>addressing this major cause of death and injury. The Legislature declares that the enactment of this section is intended to be compatible with support for federal safety standards requiring automatic crash protection systems and should not be used in any manner to rescind federal requirements for installation of automatic restraints in new cars.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b368-10\">Both general terms simply refer to an arrangement of straps or belts which can secure an occupant to the seat of a vehicle as a safety precaution in the event of an accident. (See Webster\u2019s Collegiate Diet,, <em>supra, </em>at pp. 1030, 1054.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b368-11\">The failure to wear a seat belt while operating a motor vehicle is an infraction (Veh. Code, \u00a7 27315, subd. (h)), and thus a criminal offense (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 17, 19.8). We note that in 1995 the Legislature amended the Motor Vehicle Safety Act to delete a provision which had prohibited a peace officer from, inter alia, stopping or arresting a person for not wearing a seat belt when the officer had no other cause to stop or seize the person other than for that violation. (Stats. 1995, ch. 365, \u00a7 1, operative Jan. 1, 1996.) \u201cWhen the Legislature deletes an express provision of a statute, it is presumed that it intended to effect a substantial change in the law.\u201d <em>(Royal Co. Auctioneers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Coast Printing Equipment Co. </em>(1987) 193 Cal.App.3d 868, 873 [238 Cal.Rptr. 538].) There thus was no statutory prohibition against the officer detaining appellant for the seat belt violation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b369-10\">Judge of the Los Angeles Superior Court, assigned by the Chief Justice pursuant to article VI, section 6 of the California Constitution.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
