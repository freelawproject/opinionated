He contends the trial court erred in denying his motion because the police improperly relied on the consent of his 16-year-old daughter when they entered his home. He claims their subsequent search of his bedroom, though performed with his permission, was tainted fruit of the unlawful entry. We find to the contrary: After knocking, officers entered the residence legally, in response to his daughter\u2019s invitation. Their actions were not only reasonable but legal, given the circumstances. We therefore uphold the ruling on the motion to suppress and affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>After Hoxter failed to appear in court to answer charges in an unrelated case, a warrant issued for his arrest. Around eight o\u2019clock on the evening of September 24, 1996, two Laguna Beach police officers in plain clothes stopped by his home to execute it. As they approached the front door, they met a man about 30 years old and asked if his name was \u201cDon.\u201d The man replied \u201cNo\u201d but added \u201cDon is inside.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">One of the officers knocked at the entrance, and Hoxter\u2019s 16-year-old daughter, Amy, told her younger sister to open the door. As the younger girl complied, Amy beckoned the men to \u201cCome on in.\u201d When one yelled back, \u201cWhat?\u201d Amy repeated her invitation. Thinking Amy looked 14 to 16, they entered the residence and walked into the living room where Amy was. They made no mention of their purpose; they simply told her they were looking for \u201cDon.\u201d Amy pointed to an adjoining bedroom, the door to the bedroom opened, and Hoxter stepped out to see who the visitors were.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">After confirming he was Hoxter, they identified themselves as police officers, displayed their badges, and announced they had a warrant for his arrest. As they took him into custody, they observed a portable propane tank and torch, a pipe, and a plastic baggie containing white powder\u2014all in plain view. They explained to Hoxter the difference between an arrest warrant and a search warrant and requested his consent to search the entire bedroom. When he agreed, they searched and found methamphetamine, a gram scale, and additional drug paraphernalia.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">After hearing this evidence, the trial judge denied Hoxter\u2019s motion to suppress, explaining, \u201cThe motion to suppress is denied based on the fact that it\u2019s the [c]ourt\u2019s understanding that Penal Code section 844[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>] does not apply when the officers have a valid warrant in their possession. And . . . based on the evidence received in this hearing ... the officer\u2019s rendition ... is accepted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b317-9\">Hoxter claims the consent he provided officers to search his bedroom and the evidence they discovered as a result were both tainted by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>officers\u2019 improper reliance on his 16-year-old daughter\u2019s consent to enter the residence. Specifically, he insists Amy was not old enough to provide permission to enter as a matter of law, and the officers had no reason to believe she had authority to admit them. We do not see it that way. While it appears the trial court\u2019s understanding of section 844 was at least partially inaccurate, its explicit adoption of the officers\u2019 version of the facts leads us to conclude, as a matter of law, that the officers\u2019 entry into the house was reasonable within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">We first consider the issue the court based its ruling upon: the applicability of section 844.  Contrary to the trial court\u2019s understanding, the mere fact a police officer has an arrest warrant in hand does not automatically entitle that officer to enter a suspect\u2019s home without providing the knock-notice required by the section. Where its terms are implicated, section 844 applies whether an officer has a warrant or not. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Wader </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 610, 632 [20 Cal.Rptr.2d 788, 854 P.2d 80]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Jacobs </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 472, 478 [233 Cal.Rptr. 323, 729 P.2d 757]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Schmel </em>(1975) 54 Cal.App.3d 46, 50 [126 Cal.Rptr. 317].)</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">According to the statute, if entry into a residence requires a breaking, the officer must knock and announce his or her purpose first. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Bittaker </em>(1989) 48 Cal.3d 1046, 1072 [259 Cal.Rptr. 630, 774 P.2d 659].) Without such a breaking, the knock-notice rule does not apply. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Peterson </em>(1970) 9 Cal.App.3d 627, 631 [88 Cal.Rptr. 597]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Satz </em>(1998) 61 Cal.App.4th 322, 327 [71 Cal.Rptr.2d 433] [consent obviates the need for compliance with the rule].) However, in the context of section 844, \u201cbreaking\u201d is a term of art, and neither physical violence nor actual damage is necessarily required. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1970) 5 Cal.App.3d 109, 113 [84 Cal.Rptr. 778].) \u201cEven a peaceable entry may be deemed a \u2018breaking\u2019 if the entry undermines the statutory purposes of safeguarding the privacy of citizens in their homes and preventing unnecessary violent confrontations between startled householders and arresting officers. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Jacobs, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d at p. 480; see also <em>Duke </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1969) 1 Cal.3d 314, 321 [82 Cal.Rptr. 348, 461 P.2d 628].)</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">The term covers, \u201c[a]t the very least, . . . unannounced entries that would be considered breaking as that term is used in defining common law burglary. [Citations.] As so defined, no more is needed \u2018than the opening of a door or window, even if not locked . . . or . . . latched.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rosales </em>(1968) 68 Cal.2d 299, 303 [66 Cal.Rptr. 1, 437 P.2d 489]; accord, <em>Sabbath </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1968) 391 U.S. 585, 590 [88 S.Ct. 1755, 1758-1759, 20 L.Ed.2d 828].) It also \u201cencompasses the opening of an unlocked screen door [citations], and entry through an open door \u2018at nighttime when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>the occupant apparently is asleep.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>5 Cal.App.3d at p. 113.) And unless an occupant of the residence opens the door, knock-notice must be given even if the door has been left ajar. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Bradley </em>(1969) 1 Cal.3d 80, 87-88 [81 Cal.Rptr. 457, 460 P.2d 129]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Miller </em>(1999) 69 Cal.App.4th 190, 201 [81 Cal.Rptr.2d 410]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Zabelle </em>(1996) 50 Cal.App.4th 1282, 1286 [58 Cal.Rptr.2d 105].)</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">Where a breaking occurs and, as a consequence, knock-notice requirements apply, an officer\u2019s failure to comply with the statute in whole or in part can be excused under certain circumstances (e.g., where knock-notice would place lives at serious risk, where police have articulable reasons for believing evidence is about to be destroyed, or where officers have otherwise substantially complied with its provisions). <em>(Richards </em>v. <em>Wisconsin </em>(1997) 520 U.S. 385, 394-395 [117 S.Ct. 1416, 1421-1422, 137 L.Ed.2d 615] [requiring police have a reasonable suspicion that knock-notice would inhibit an effective investigation, be dangerous or futile]; <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Arkansas </em>(1995) 514 U.S. 927, 936 [115 S.Ct. 1914, 1919, 131 L.Ed.2d 976]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Bradley, supra, </em>1 Cal.3d at p. 88; <em>People </em>v. <em>Boone </em>(1969) 2 Cal.App.3d 503, 505-506 [82 Cal.Rptr. 566].) But it is now settled that whether knock-notice is provided is part of the reasonableness inquiry required by the Fourth Amendment. <em>(Richards </em>v. <em>Wisconsin, supra, </em>520 U.S. at p. 387 [117 S.Ct. at p. 1418]; <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Arkansas, supra, </em>514 U.S. at pp. 934-936 [115 S.Ct. at pp. 1918-1919]; accord, <em>People </em>v. <em>Mays </em>(1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 969, 973 [79 Cal.Rptr.2d 519]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Zabelle, supra, </em>50 Cal.App.4th at p. 1286.)</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">In entering Hoxter\u2019s home, of course, the officers were not required so much as to touch the door after knocking on it. It was opened for them, and they were invited in. Ordinarily, that would have been enough to demonstrate no \u201cbreaking,\u201d as contemplated by the statute, occurred. But it is not quite that simple here. The door was opened at the direction of a minor. And unless she had actual or apparent authority to authorize the officers\u2019 entry, her consent was not valid, and the officers\u2019 entry was accomplished by a breaking within the meaning of section 844. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Jacobs, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d at pp. 480-481.)</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">In <em>Jacobs, </em>a slim majority of our Supreme Court held that an 11-year-old babysitter was insufficiently mature to grant consent for uniformed officers to enter the home despite the fact she had been left in charge and lived at the residence. However, even the <em>Jacobs </em>majority recognized that \u201c[a]s a child advances in age she acquires greater discretion to admit visitors on her own authority.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Jacobs, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d at p. 483.)</p>\n<p id=\"b320-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>As we see it, sufficient discretion certainly exists by the time a child reaches the age of Hoxter\u2019s daughter.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> There is a significant difference between a child of 11 and a young woman who, at 16, is less than 2 short years away from voting, marrying without parental consent (see Fam. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 301, 302) and under California case law, already able to obtain an abortion. <em>(Academy of Pediatrics </em>v. <em>Lungren </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th 307, 356-359 [66 Cal.Rptr.2d 210, 940 P.2d 797].)</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">We are convinced that one of the characteristics of the end of the 20th century is that many California 16-year-olds are mature enough to be left in charge of their homes.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Certainly police officers confronted by a young woman of that age who appears to have such authority may reasonably forego knock-notice in reliance upon the likelihood her parents have made that decision. But we hasten to express our recognition that not <em>all </em>16-year-olds will either have or appear to have such authority, and that the reasonableness of reliance upon their consent is initially a matter of fact for the trial court to resolve. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Wilkins </em>(1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 761, 772 [17 Cal.Rptr.2d 743].)</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">Here, the trial court made no explicit ruling concerning Amy\u2019s consent. It did, however, expressly find that the \u201cofficer\u2019s rendition\u201d of the facts was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>\u201caccepted.\u201d According to that rendition, Amy appeared to be in her mid-teens (i.e., 14 to 16 years of age), and she engaged in conduct consistent with what would be expected from a person who has authority to exercise some degree of control over the premises (i.e., supervising the conduct of her younger sister and twice inviting the officers to \u201cCome on in\u201d). Moreover, when confronted with the fact his daughter had admitted two police officers into his home, Hoxter made no inquiry into how they came to be there and no effort to revoke the consent. Instead, he consented fully and gave permission for a search of his bedroom. A finding that Amy provided valid consent to enter the residence is thus not only implicit in the court\u2019s ruling but also well supported by the facts.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">Under <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Rodriguez </em>(1990) 497 U.S. 177, 188-189 [110 S.Ct. 2793, 111 L.Ed.2d 148], an officer\u2019s decision to rely upon any third party consent is \u201c \u2018judged against an objective standard: would the facts available to the officer <em>at the moment. </em>. . \u201cwarrant a [person] of reasonable caution in the belief\u2019 that the consenting party had authority over the premises? [Citation.] If not, then the warrantless entry without further inquiry is unlawful unless actual authority existed. But if so, the search is valid.\u2019 \u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">It seems to us that when a 16-year-old directs her younger sister to open the door to strangers, such conduct demonstrates that at least she believes she has authority to grant consent for entry. That being so, it is hard to fault an officer who is of the same opinion \u201cat the moment\u201d he or she has to make the call. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Ingram </em>(1981) 122 Cal.App.3d 673, 679 [176 Cal.Rptr. 199] [an officer\u2019s objectively reasonable, good faith belief in the apparent authority of the person giving consent is sufficient, even if factually mistaken]; accord, <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hamilton </em>(9th Cir. 1986) 792 F.2d 837, 842; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lopez-Diaz </em>(9th Cir. 1980) 630 F.2d 661, <em>666-661.)</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">Therefore, on the facts of this case, we find the officers\u2019 belief that Amy had apparent authority to provide them consent to enter her home was made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>in good faith and was eminently reasonable under the circumstances. And since the entry was made with valid consent, we conclude the officers did not commit a breaking within the meaning of section 844 and were under no obligation to announce their purpose before entering. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Lara </em>(1974) 12 Cal.3d 903, 909 [117 Cal.Rptr. 549, 528 P.2d 365] [where defendant\u2019s sister \u201c \u2018let the officer into the living room,\u2019 \u201d officers not required to comply with section 844]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>5 Cal.App.3d 109, 112, 114 [officers lawfully entered after door was opened for them and they were told to \u201cCome on in\u201d]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Ramirez </em>(1970) 4 Cal.App.3d 154, 156-157 [84 Cal.Rptr. 104] [same].)</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">In conclusion, it must be noted that, ultimately, Amy\u2019s consent was not necessary for entry into the house. Her invitation to enter excused knock-notice but was not essential to justify the officers\u2019 decision to cross the threshold. Having been informed Hoxter was present inside the house, the officers were entitled to enter because they had a facially valid arrest warrant in their possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">As the United States Supreme Court explained in <em>Payton </em>v. <em>New York </em>(1980) 445 U.S. 573, 603 [100 S.Ct. 1371, 1388, 63 L.Ed.2d 639], \u201can arrest warrant founded on probable cause implicitly carries with it the limited authority to enter a dwelling in which the suspect lives <em>when there is reason to believe the suspect is </em>within\u201d\u2014as there was here.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (Italics added.) Neither an exigency <em>nor consent </em>to enter is necessary. (See <em>Steagald </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1981) 451 U.S. 204, 214-215, fn. 7 [101 S.Ct. 1642, 1648-1649, 68 L.Ed.2d 38]; <em>People </em>v. <em>LeBlanc </em>(1997) 60 Cal.App.4th 157, 164 [70 Cal.Rptr.2d 195]; cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Jacobs, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d at p. 484 (dis. opn. of Mosk, J.) [finding it unnecessary to reach the consent issue after concluding the officers substantially complied with the requirements of section 844 and lawfully entered the house].)</p>\n<p id=\"b322-9\">Since the officers here had a valid warrant for Hoxter\u2019s arrest, not to mention Amy\u2019s efficacious consent, their entry into his home to execute the warrant did not offend the Fourth Amendment And since their entry required no forcible breaking of the threshold, an announcement pursuant to section 844 prior to entry was not required. Consequently, we conclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>Hoxter\u2019s consent to search his bedroom was not tainted by any prior illegality, and all the evidence seized from that room was properly admitted against him.

Thus, parents risk that police officers who come to their residence to enforce the law will reason in good faith that the person who has been left in charge of the premises has the concomitant right to grant consent for entry. If that risk seems onerous, the parents need not assume it or can instruct whomever is left in charge of the premises not to admit the police or others they deem undesirable.

In contrast, here, the officers had been informed by an adult outside the front door that \u201cDon is inside.\u201d Clearly, had Hoxter come to the door, he could not have prevented the officers from entering his home by refusing to grant them permission to do so.
