Code, \u00a7 6600 et seq.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> against real party, Joseph Louis Perez, a legal immigrant. Perez claims that because he will be deported before he can receive the benefit of conditional release and outpatient treatment provided for in the SVP Act, any commitment under the SVP Act would violate the equal protection provisions of the state and federal constitutions. We hold that neither the action of the People in filing the SVP Act petition nor the decision of the federal government to defer action on Perez\u2019s deportation pending the outcome of the SVP Act petition has resulted in invidiously discriminatory disparate treatment under the otherwise neutral SVP Act. We conclude, therefore, that the superior court erred in dismissing the SVP Act petition filed against Perez.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-10\">Summary of Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b305-11\">The People filed a SVP Act petition against Perez, a legal immigrant, alleging that he is a sexually violent offender. Attached to the petition were exhibits showing that Perez had been convicted of numerous counts of sexual abuse of a child, and had, as a result, been sentenced to a lengthy prison term. Later, an amended petition was filed adding an out-of-state conviction for lewd assault suffered by Perez in 1977.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-12\">Perez moved to dismiss the petition claiming that because he will be deported before he can receive the benefit of conditional release and outpatient treatment provided for in the SVP Act, any commitment under the SVP Act would violate the equal protection provisions of the state and federal Constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>At the hearing held on the motion to dismiss, an Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) special agent, Craig Porter, testified as to the removal (deportation) procedures employed by the INS where, as here, an alien has committed a crime. He testified that Perez would not be allowed to be released to the community. Porter was not asked, and thus expressed no opinion, as to whether Perez would be allowed to be released to the community should an outpatient treatment program be made available to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">The trial court adopted Perez\u2019s equal protection argument, and granted his motion to dismiss the SVP Act petition. This petition for writ of mandate followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">The People contend that the order dismissing the SVP Act petition was premature because it is speculative as to whether Perez will be deported should he be released to the community. The People also contend that the SVP Act does not violate the equal protection provisions of the federal and state constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">A. <em>The SVP Act.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b306-9\">The SVP Act mandates psychological and psychiatric evaluation of specified convicted sex offenders before release at the end of their penal terms. If a sex offender is diagnosed with a current mental disorder that predisposes him to commit further violent sex crimes, a civil petition may be filed seeking to have him institutionalized for treatment. If proven beyond a reasonable doubt to a jury that the sex offender is a danger to others because he has a continuing mental disorder which makes it likely that he will commit future violent sex crimes if released without treatment, the sex offender may be committed for treatment in a mental health facility. Treatment may last as long as the mental disorder continues, but in no event longer than two years unless a further commitment petition is successfully pursued. (\u00a7 6600 et seq.)</p>\n<p id=\"b306-10\">The treatment provided to a person committed under the SVP Act must be \u201cconsistent with current institutional standards for the treatment of sex offenders, and shall be based on a structured treatment protocol developed by the State Department of Mental Health.\u201d (\u00a7 6606, subd. (c).) Initially, the SVP Act contemplates treatment in a secure facility located on the grounds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>of an institution under the jurisdiction of the Department of Corrections. (\u00a7 6604.) Thereafter, the SVP Act provides at least three methods whereby a person may be conditionally released into community outpatient programs as part of his or her ongoing treatment. At least once every year, a committee shall have his or her mental condition examined by the State Department of Mental Health and, should the committee so request, by an expert or professional person. (\u00a7 6605, subd. (a).) An annual petition for conditional release pursuant to section 6608 must be calendared unless the committee affirmatively waives his or her right to such petition. (\u00a7 6605, subd. (b).) Additionally, a committee may petition the court for a conditional release. (\u00a7 6608, subd. (a).) After a hearing pursuant to section 6608, the court may release a committee to be placed in an \u201cappropriate forensic conditional release program\u201d which includes \u201coutpatient supervision and treatment.\u201d (\u00a7 6608, subd. (d).) A petition for conditional release may also be made by the State Department of Mental Health. (\u00a7 6607, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">B. <em>The Attorney General of the United States may defer deportation proceedings in favor of a SVP Act petition.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">The People contend that the order dismissing the SVP Act petition was premature because it is speculative as to whether Perez will be deported should he be released to the community for outpatient treatment since the Attorney General of the United States (Attorney General) has the discretion to defer deportation proceedings in favor of allowing such treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">Special agent Porter\u2019s testimony, fairly read, supports a finding that \u201ccriminal aliens\u201d such as Perez ordinarily would be deported if released to the community. However, Porter was not asked, and thus expressed no opinion, as to whether deportation proceedings could, or would, be deferred if an outpatient treatment program was made available to Perez at the time of his release to the community. We conclude, therefore, that Porter\u2019s testimony provides little, if any, support for the contention that Perez\u2019s deportation is mandatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">Perez does not rely solely on Porter\u2019s testimony. Perez points out that he has been convicted of numerous counts of sexual abuse of a minor, and of lewd assault. Under the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1101 et seq.), such offenses constitute \u201caggravated\u201d felonies. (8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(A), (F).) The legal significance of an alien\u2019s conviction for an aggravated felony is that he or she is conclusively presumed to be deport-able. (8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1228(c).) The Attorney General is required to initiate proceedings against an alien convicted of an offense which renders him or her deportable as \u201cexpeditiously as possible after the date of the conviction.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>(8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1229(d)(1).) In addition, the alien is unable to apply for cancellation of removal proceedings (8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1229b(a)), is subject to \u201cexpedited\u201d removal (8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1228(a)(3)(A)), and is permanently barred from returning to the United States (8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1182(a)).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">The foregoing regulations strongly suggest that Perez would be deported if ever released to the community. However, <em>Reno </em>v. <em>American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Comm. </em>(1999) 525 U.S. 471 [119 S.Ct. 936, 142 L.Ed.2d 940] <em>(Reno) </em>makes clear that the Attorney General has the discretion to defer Perez\u2019s deportation in order to provide him an opportunity for outpatient treatment pursuant to the SVP Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">In <em>Reno, </em>resident aliens filed suit claiming that they had been targeted for deportation because of their affiliation with a politically unpopular group, in violation of their First and Fifth Amendment rights. <em>(Reno, supra, </em>525 U.S. at pp. 472-474 [119 S.Ct. at pp. 938-939].) While their suit was pending, Congress passed the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA), which contains section 1252(g) (Section 1252(g)). (525 U.S. at pp. 472-473 [119 S.Ct. at p. 938].) Section 1252(g) provides as follows: \u201cExclusive Jurisdiction. [\u00b6] Except as provided in this section and notwithstanding any other provision of law, no court shall have jurisdiction to hear any cause or claim by or on behalf of any alien arising from the decision or action by the Attorney General to commence proceedings, adjudicate cases, or execute removal orders against any alien under this chapter.\u201d (8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1252(g).) The <em>Reno </em>court concluded that in those instances where an alien files an action challenging a decision or action by the Attorney General which falls within the three discrete actions listed in Section 1252(g), Section 1252(g) strips the federal district court of jurisdiction over the alien\u2019s action. <em>(Reno, supra, </em>525 U.S. at p. 482 [119 S.Ct. at p. 943].)</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">The Supreme Court\u2019s description of Section 1252(g)\u2019s purpose and why Congress would focus on the three discrete actions listed in Section 1252(g) is instructive. The Supreme Court explained that \u201c[t]here was good reason for Congress to focus special attention upon, and make special provision for, judicial review of the Attorney General\u2019s discrete acts of \u2018commenc[ing] proceedings, adjudicating] cases, [and] executing] removal orders\u2019\u2014which represent the initiation or prosecution of various stages in the deportation process. At each stage the Executive has discretion to abandon the endeavor, and at the time IIRIRA was enacted the INS had been engaging in a regular <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>practice (which had come to be known as \u2018deferred action\u2019) of exercising that discretion for humanitarian reasons or simply for its own convenience. As one treatise describes it: [\u00b6] \u2018To ameliorate a harsh and unjust outcome, the INS may decline to institute proceedings, terminate proceedings, or decline to execute a final order of deportation. This commendable exercise in administrative discretion, developed without express statutory authorization, originally was known as nonpriority and is now designated as deferred action. A case may be selected for deferred action treatment at any stage of the administrative process. Approval of deferred action status means that, for the humanitarian reasons described below, no action will thereafter be taken to proceed against an apparently deportable alien, even on grounds normally regarded as aggravated.\u2019 [Citations.] Since no generous act goes unpunished, however, the INS\u2019s exercise of this discretion opened the door to litigation in instances where the INS chose <em>not </em>to exercise it. [\u00b6] \u2018[I]n each such instance, the determination to withhold or terminate deportation is confined to administrative discretion. . . . Efforts to challenge the refusal to exercise such discretion on behalf of specific aliens sometimes have been favorably considered by the courts, upon contentions that there was selective prosecution in violation of equal protection or due process, such as improper reliance on political considerations, on racial, religious, or nationality discriminations, on arbitrary or unconstitutional criteria, or on other grounds constituting abuse of discretion.\u2019 [Citation.] Such litigation was possible because courts read [section] 1105a\u2019s prescription that the Hobbs Act shall be \u2018the sole and exclusive procedure for the judicial review of all final orders of deportation\u2019 to be inapplicable to various decisions and actions leading up to or consequent upon final orders of deportation, and relied on other jurisdictional statutes to permit review. [Citations.] Section 1252(g) seems clearly designed to give some measure of protection to \u2018no deferred action\u2019 decisions and similar discretionary determinations, providing that if they are reviewable at all, they at least will not be made the bases for separate rounds of judicial intervention outside the streamlined process that Congress has designed.\u201d <em>(Reno, supra, </em>525 U. S. at pp. 483-485 [119 S.Ct. at pp. 943-944], fns. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">Perez argues that <em>Reno </em>is inapplicable because the aliens in that case were not \u201ccriminal aliens,\u201d and their deportation was \u201cdiscretionary\u201d rather than \u201cmandatory.\u201d <em>Reno </em>cannot be read so narrowly. It holds that the Attorney General has the nonreviewable discretion to defer any action on any deportation proceeding for humanitarian reasons or for its own convenience. This is true even though Perez is conclusively presumed to be deportable (8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1228(c)), and the Attorney General has an obligation to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>begin deportation proceedings as expeditiously as possible. (8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1229(d)(1).)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">Here, the Attorney General has legally deferred action of Perez\u2019s deportation in favor of proceeding under the SVP Act even though Perez is no longer confined in state prison as a criminal. Should Perez ever meet the criteria for conditional release (a subject of mere speculation at this time), it is an open question whether the Attorney General, at that time, would consider deferring action on deportation pending the completion of treatment under a conditional release program. It is possible\u2014given the nature of Perez\u2019s crimes\u2014that the Attorney General would consider such a deferment. The alternative would be to deport Perez, untreated, to Mexico. Left untreated, his mental condition could cause him to resume his attacks on young children in Mexico, or return illegally to this country and attack children here. INS special agent Porter testified, essentially, that the Attorney General would defer action on Perez\u2019s deportation proceedings in favor of the SVP Act petition. In other words, the INS would allow Perez the benefit of psychiatric help rather than deport a sexually violent predator to Mexico. Porter also testified that should Perez be released to the community the detainer would be reinstated and removal proceedings would commence. While Porter\u2019s testimony provides some evidence that Perez may not be allowed to participate in a conditional release program at some time in the future, it is not the last word on the subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">We conclude that because the Attorney General has the nonreviewable discretion to defer deportation proceedings in favor of a SVP petition, the order dismissing the petition filed against Perez was premature\u2014because it is speculative whether Perez will be deported should he be released to the community to be treated on an outpatient basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">C. <em>The SVP Act is fair and nondiscriminatory on its </em>face, <em>and no evidence of intentional or purposeful discrimination against Perez individually has been presented.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">The People contend that the Attorney General acted legally in deferring deportation proceedings against Perez pending the outcome of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>SVP Act petition, and that this action did not purposefully and intentionally single out Perez for disparate treatment under the SVP laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides that no state shall \u201cdeny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\u201d (See also Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 7, subd. (a).) \u201cEqual protection\u201d requires that persons similarly situated receive equal treatment. (8 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (9th ed. 1998) Constitutional Law, \u00a7 593, p. 44.) Three methods exist for establishing and testing classifications of a statute under the equal protection clause, \u201con its face,\u201d in its \u201capplication,\u201d and in \u201cpurpose and effect.\u201d (3 Rotunda &amp; Nowak, Treatise on Constitutional Law: Substance and Procedure (2d ed. 1992) \u00a7 18.4, p. 41.) A statute which establishes a classification \u201con its face\u201d means that the law by its own terms classifies persons for different treatment. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 42.) A statute is tested in its \u201capplication\u201d when it \u201ceither shows no classification on its face or else indicates a classification which seems to be legitimate, but those persons challenging the legislation claim that the governmental officials who administer the law are applying it with different degrees of severity to different groups of persons who are described by some suspect trait.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Thirdly, the \u201claw may contain no classification, or a neutral classification, and be applied evenhandedly. Nevertheless the law may be challenged as in reality constituting a device designed to impose different burdens on different classes of persons.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">State discrimination against legal immigrants is a classification subject to heightened scrutiny. <em>(Graham </em>v. <em>Richardson </em>(1971) 403 U.S. 365, 372 [91 S.Ct. 1848, 1852, 29 L.Ed.2d 534].)</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">Perez concedes that the SVP Act vis-\u00e0-vis an individual\u2019s immigration status does not \u201con its face\u201d create a suspect classification. He claims, however, that in its \u201capplication\u201d and \u201cpurpose and effect\u201d the SVP Act in his case denies him equal protection of the laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">Since the SVP Act is fair and nondiscriminatory on its face concerning alienage, state action against Perez can result in a violation of equal protection only if the action results in purposeful or intentional discrimination.  \u201c \u2018Unequal treatment which results simply from laxity of enforcement or which reflects a nonarbitrary basis for selective enforcement of a statute does not deny equal protection and is not constitutionally prohibited discriminatory enforcement.\u2019 [Citation.] Unequal application of a statute or rule to persons entitled to be treated alike is not a denial of equal protection \u2018unless there is shown to be present in it an element of intentional or purposeful discrimination.\u2019 [Citation.] What the equal protection guarantee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>prohibits is state officials \u2018purposefully and intentionally singling out individuals for disparate treatment on an invidiously discriminatory basis.\u2019 [Citation].\u201d <em>(Cilderman </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 1466, 1470 [80 Cal.Rptr.2d 20] [in which the respondent complained of uneven application against him of a Los Angeles County Civil Service Commission rule].)</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">Perez, citing <em>People </em>v. <em>Hernandez </em>(1970) 10 Cal.App.3d 646 [89 Cal.Rptr. 192], claims that the SVP Act, as it is applied to him, violates equal protection because the state action involved is the result of purposeful or intentional discrimination. In <em>Hernandez, </em>the defendants complained that they were precluded from participating in drug rehabilitation programs because the courts illegally considered their status as aliens. The Court of Appeal agreed. \u201c[P]ending deportation would clearly relate to the party\u2019s \u2018fitness for \u201cconfinement or treatment in a rehabilitation facility,\u201d \u2019 . . . since the program depends on continued availability for treatment. Also pending deportation would [a]ffect the party\u2019s ability \u2018to participate either in the educational or therapeutic programs at the rehabilitation center,\u2019 . . . since obviously defendant would not be able to participate in programs at the rehabilitation center when he is deported. The rehabilitation program contemplates an extended period of institutional and outpatient treatment. The law contemplates a seven-year commitment, and a minimum of six months spent as an inpatient, with the addict then being placed on outpatient status . . . and pending deportation makes this program impossible.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 649.)</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">Unlike the defendants in <em>Hernandez, </em>Perez complains that the People seek to place him in a rehabilitation program without considering his status as an alien. As previously discussed, it is an open question whether the Attorney General would defer initiating deportation proceedings against Perez should Perez become eligible\u2014at some future date\u2014for outpatient treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">Perez next claims that the \u201cpurpose and effect\u201d of the SVP Act constitutes a device designed to impose different burdens on different classes of persons. In support of his contention, Perez again asserts that because it is \u201clegally impossible for deportable aliens to complete\u201d outpatient treatment, he, unlike United States citizens, will never be afforded an opportunity to become fully rehabilitated. He once again concludes that he has been singled out for disparate treatment under the SVP Act. As previously discussed, since the Attorney General has the unreviewable discretion to defer any deportation proceedings which may\u2014at some future date\u2014be initiated against Perez, it is an open question whether he will be allowed to be released to the community to participate in an outpatient program.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>We hold that neither the action of the People in filing the SVP Act petition nor the decision of the federal government to defer action on Perez\u2019s deportation pending the outcome of the petition have resulted in invidiously discriminatory disparate treatment under the otherwise neutral SVP Act. We conclude, therefore, that the superior court erred in dismissing the SVP Act petition filed against Perez.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">Let a writ of mandate issue directing the superior court to set aside its order granting real party\u2019s motion to dismiss, and to issue a new and different order denying the motion. The order to show cause is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">Nott, J., and Zebrowski, J, concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b305-13\">All further statutory references are to the Welfare and Institutions Code unless otherwise indicated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b308-7\">Perez notes that he is also subject to deportation because he has been convicted of a crime of moral turpitude (8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I)), and because he has been convicted of two or more offenses. (8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(B).)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b310-8\">Title 8 United States Code Annotated section 1229(d)(1) was formerly numbered as section 1252(i).
