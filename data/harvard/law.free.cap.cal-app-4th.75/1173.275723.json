J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ab-\">Victor Vincent Andrews was found guilty of threatening a public official, attempting to extort money and five counts of making annoying telephone calls. On appeal he maintains the evidence was insufficient to support some of his convictions, the prosecutor committed prejudicial misconduct and the trial court made two instructional errors. We are unpersuaded by his arguments and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-12\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b798-13\">Andrews filed a workers\u2019 compensation action against his employer and its insurance company, CIGNA. In 1995, he represented himself during the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1175\">*1175</page-number>three-day trial. Judge Christine Nelson ruled in favor of Andrews\u2019s employer and CIGNA.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">While Andrews\u2019s appeal was pending, he repeatedly attempted to contact his employer\u2019s attorney, Steve McNamara. His recorded voice mail messages, letters and statements to a private investigator are the basis of the charged offenses. They are as follows.:</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">August 16, 1996\u2014Andrews left a voice mail message stating he was considering filing a lawsuit against those involved in the workers\u2019 compensation lawsuit. He said his civil rights had been violated and a \u201chate crime\u201d had been committed against him. Andrews wanted McNamara to, \u201cadvise your people\u201d he would file the lawsuit in a few weeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-7\">March 4, 1997\u2014Andrews left a voice mail message saying if a civil lawsuit \u201cdoesn\u2019t work maybe a criminal trial will work. Whatever is necessary I will never give up. I will never give up Steve, never.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b799-8\">March 17, 1997\u2014In another voice mail message, Andrews said he had proof McNamara, Judge Nelson and others had conspired against him. Once again, he warned McNamara he would file a lawsuit unless they agreed to settle his case. He told McNamara he would expose the conspiracy in the Los Angeles Times and on the television news show <em>Sixty Minutes. </em>Andrews threatened to \u201cdestroy the lives of everybody . . . involved in this conspiracy, everybody.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b799-9\">March 19, 1997\u2014Andrews left four voice mail messages. First, Andrews accused Judge Nelson of taking bribes from attorneys and insurance companies. He claimed, \u201cIf I am involved in a criminal trial[,] I [will be] able to prove [the bribes occurred] and destroy all you guys.\u201d In the second message, Andrews asserted, \u201cIf I have a jury trial, . . . I will never be convicted because you are . . . all. . . mother-fuckers, the top of the mother-fuckers,\u201d and \u201cyou are asking for fucking problems.\u201d Finally, Andrews in his last two recordings said he would sacrifice his life if necessary for his cause and reiterated he may be forced to participate in a criminal trial and \u201cbring in all the dirt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b799-10\">The following month, McNamara received a letter, dated April 2, from Andrews. Although Andrews\u2019s appeal of Judge Nelson\u2019s ruling had been denied, he told McNamara, \u201cI am willing to settle the case for the symbolic sum of $50,000. In addition, you must pay all the liens on my workers\u2019 compensation case. This will buy peace for everyone who is involved in the violation of civil rights, human rights, conspiracy and possibly hate crime[s]. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1176\">*1176</page-number>If you do not respond to my letter in 14 days, I will understand this is my green light to initiate the process to punish with my blood on their hands.\u201d McNamara gave the letter to the police and Judge Nelson. CIGNA hired an investigator, Kevin Barsumian, to follow and watch Andrews.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">April 16, 1997\u2014Andrews noticed Barsumian was watching him and learned who he was. Andrews then told Barsumian he knew Judge Nelson had accepted bribes during his workers\u2019 compensation case and said he was \u201cgoing to kill the mother-fucker.\u201d He claimed he could \u201cget the judge\u201d without being caught and bragged he could \u201cblow[] out the doors and windows\u201d of the workers\u2019 compensation building. He explained this plan would require the help of someone else and that he did not want to do it on a weekend. Andrews told Barsumian, \u201cat the very least he would throw a bucket of red paint on [Judge Nelson] while she was in her chambers.\u201d Andrews also asserted he was going to tell the FBI and the Attorney General about Judge Nelson\u2019s misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">On the same day, Andrews left several messages for McNamara. In the first one, he said he had met three investigators who were following him and had almost killed one of them. He claimed he \u201ccould kill \u2019em with a car, you know, I don\u2019t have to kill \u2019em with a gun you know,\u201d Next, Andrews spoke with McNamara\u2019s clerk, saying they should not worry about the investigators\u2019 safety because he was \u201cnot out to hurt them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">Andrews called McNamara three more times that day. In two voice mail messages he predicted, \u201cso many lives will be destroyed\u201d and \u201cwhen the shit hit[s] the fan ... I will not be able to stop it.\u201d In his final voice mail message, Andrews said he would not harm McNamara \u201cbut the fucking prostitute fucking bitch [Judge] Nelson, oh yeah. I have plenty of shit against the mother-fucking prostitute. I wouldn\u2019t do any harm to you. Don\u2019t worry about it. I love your face, this is enough to spare you, but this fucking prostitute, [Judge] Nelson, I don\u2019t know, you know. I will go through the process but if I fail, if I don\u2019t find any understanding, I will eliminate and we\u2019ll probably meet in fucking heaven.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b800-7\">Believing Judge Nelson was in danger, McNamara notified her about the voice mail messages and the investigator\u2019s conversation with Andrews. The police subsequently arrested Andrews.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1177\">*1177</page-number>At trial, Andrews testified his statements had been misunderstood. He explained he is a Polish immigrant and sometimes has trouble communicating in English. He says he often has problems finding the right English words to say, especially when he is excited.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">Andrews claims the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction for threatening a public official in violation of Penal Code section 76 because the prosecution failed to prove his threats caused Judge Nelson to fear for her safety.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Attorney General maintains section 76 should not be interpreted to require such a mental state on the part of the victim. Neither we nor the parties have found any authority directly addressing this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-7\">\u201cWe apply the following established principles in construing the subject statute. The \u2018 \u201cfundamental purpose of statutory construction is to ascertain the intent of the lawmakers so as to effectuate the purpose of the law. In determining this intent, courts look first to the words contained in the statute, giving them their usual and ordinary meaning.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Carron </em>(1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1230, 1236 [44 Cal.Rptr.2d 328], citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b801-9\">Section 76, subdivision (a) states, \u201cEvery person who knowingly and willingly threatens the life of, or threatens serious bodily harm to, any . . . judge, . . . with the specific intent that the statement is to be taken as a threat, and the apparent ability to carry out that threat by any means, is guilty of a public offense . . . .\u201d Subdivision (c)(5) defines \u201cthreat\u201d as \u201ca verbal or written threat or a threat implied by a pattern of conduct or a combination of verbal or written statements and conduct made with the intent and the apparent ability to carry out the threat <em>so as to cause the person who is the target of the threat to reasonably fear for his or her safety </em>or the safety of his or her immediate family.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b801-10\">The Attorney General asserts the only \u201clogical interpretation of this language is that the person making the threat does so with the intent to cause the target to reasonably fear for his safety, not that the target actually be in such fear.\u201d To agree with this conclusion, however, \"we would have to ignore the above italicized portion of the definition. It clearly states the threat must be made in a manner <em>\u201cso as to cause\u201d </em>the victim to be afraid. (\u00a7 76, subd. (c)(5), italics added.) We must presume \u201cthe Legislature meant what it said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1178\">*1178</page-number>and the plain meaning of the statute governs. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Snook </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th 1210, 1215 [69 Cal.Rptr.2d 615, 947 P.2d 808].)</p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\">Moreover, we have reviewed the pertinent legislative history and discovered the legislators modeled the language found in section 76, subdivision (c)(5) after \u201cthe definition of \u2018threat\u2019 currently in Penal Code section 646.9 regarding stalking.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (Sen. Com. on Judiciary, Analysis of Sen. Bill No. 1463 (1993-1994 Reg. Sess.) as amended Apr. 7, 1994; Off. of Sen. Floor Analyses, 3d reading analysis of Sen. Bill No. 1463 (1993-1994 Reg. Sess.).) The stalking statute requires that \u201cquite apart from the perpetrator\u2019s <em>intent </em>to induce fear, the <em>victim must actually fear </em>death or great bodily injury and that fear must be reasonable.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Carron, supra, </em>37 Cal.App.4th at p. 1238, second italics added; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Falck </em>(1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 287, 299 [60 Cal.Rptr.2d 624].) Accordingly, we find the prosecution was required to prove the victim \u201creasonably feared for his or her safety.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">However, our ruling is a hollow victory for Andrews because our review of the record shows there was sufficient evidence establishing Judge Nelson reasonably feared for her safety. Andrews maintains there was only one statement \u201cthat could conceivably be considered threatening,\u201d but it is too unclear and ambiguous \u201cto instill the type of reasonable fear contemplated under\u201d the statute. We find the record shows Andrews made several unequivocal specific threats to injure and Mil Judge Nelson.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">We first note there is no dispute Judge Nelson knew about Andrews\u2019s threats. Because McNamara feared for their safety, he provided the judge with transcripts of all the voice mail messages and told her about the investigator\u2019s distressing conversation with Andrews. Thus, the judge heard that Andrews wished to \u201cdestroy the lives of everybody\u201d involved in his case. She knew he had made a disturbing promise to \u201cinitiate the process to punish with my blood on their hands.\u201d Although it is unclear what exactly Andrews intended to do, his message certainly conveyed violence and injury was involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-7\">Against this backdrop, the judge next learned Andrews had boasted to a private investigator he had a specific plan to \u201cget the judge\u201d by blowing up her workplace. Andrews threatened he was \u201cgoing to Mil the mother fucker.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1179\">*1179</page-number>There was no reason for the judge not to believe such a serious life-threatening statement was real. Andrews also promised McNamara that he would not be harmed, but warned Judge Nelson would not be so lucky. As to her, he threatened \u201c[I]f I don\u2019t find any understanding, I will eliminate and we\u2019ll probably meet in fucking heaven.\u201d The meaning of this threat was clear and unambiguous. Obviously Andrews and Judge Nelson could not meet in heaven unless they were both dead. Because it was plainly evident Andrews despised the judge and desired to harm her, the jury could rationally infer Judge Nelson reasonably feared for her safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">III-VIII<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-7\">Crosby, J., and Bedsworth, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-8\">On October 27, 1999, the opinion was modified to read as printed above.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b800-8\">With reluctance we repeat word for word Andrews\u2019s offensive statements. His repeated use of the same vulgar epithet makes this opinion read like a sleazy bad movie script. We are reminded of a great quotation, authored by Justice Gardner in <em>People </em>v. <em>Benton </em>(1978) 77 Cal.App.3d 322 [142 Cal.Rptr. 545]. There the defendant, before a robbery, told his victim \u201cDon\u2019t say a word, don\u2019t say a mother-fucking word.\u201d Justice Gardner noted, \u201cIt is a sad commentary on contemporary culture to compare, \u2018Don\u2019t say a word, don\u2019t say a mother-fucking word\u2019 with \u2018Stand and deliver,\u2019 the famous salutation of Dick Turpin and other early English highwaymen. It is true that both salutations lead to robbery. However, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1177\">*1177</page-number>there is a certain rich style to \u2018Stand and deliver.\u2019 On the other hand, \u2018Don\u2019t say a word, don\u2019t say a mother-fucking word\u2019 conveys only dismal vulgarity.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 324, fn. 1.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b801-12\">All further statutory references are to the Penal Code unless otherwise indicated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b802-8\">At the time, the stalking statute read in pertinent part, as follows, \u201cFor the purposes of this section, \u2018credible threat\u2019 means a verbal or written threat or a threat implied by a pattern of conduct or a combination of verbal or written statements and conduct made with the intent and the apparent ability to carry out the threat so as to cause the person who is the target of the threat to reasonably fear for his or her safety or the safety of his or her immediate family.\u201d (Former \u00a7 646.9, subd.
