The trial court granted summary judgment for the defendant employer. The plaintiff employee appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-11\">The evidence suggests a strong possibility, perhaps a strong likelihood, that a trier of fact would resolve the issues in favor of the defendant employer on the \u201cgood cause\u201d termination issue. It is not so clear from the evidence presented, however, that a reasonable trier of fact <em>would necessarily have to </em>resolve the issues in favor of the defendant employer. To assist in further development of the issues, we authorized further briefing. Both sides presented skillfully prepared and helpful letter briefs. Although the issue is close, we conclude that the evidence did not conclusively establish that there were no triable issues of material fact regarding the meaning of the parties\u2019 implied agreement and whether what the plaintiff employee did amounted to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>\u201cgood cause\u201d to terminate within that meaning. In the published portion of this opinion, we will therefore reverse the summary judgment on plaintiff\u2019s claim of breach of implied contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">In the unpublished portion of this opinion, we will conclude that the defendant employer\u2019s summary judgment motion did not negate plaintiff\u2019s prima facie case of age discrimination. Hence we will also reverse the summary judgment on that claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">I. <em>Summary judgment standards.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">a. <em>How the evidence must be viewed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">Since this appeal follows the granting of summary judgment, the evidence must be examined according to summary judgment standards.  Examining evidence in light of summary judgment standards is far different from applying the substantial evidence test that often governs on appeal. In the judgment after trial context the evidence need only be sufficient to support the judgment for the winning party, even though the evidence might, in another reasonable mind, also have supported a judgment for the losing party. In the summary judgment context, by contrast, the evidence must be incapable of supporting a judgment for the losing party in order to validate the summary judgment. Thus even though it may appear that a trial court took a \u201creasonable\u201d view of the evidence, a summary judgment cannot properly be affirmed unless a contrary view would be unreasonable as a matter of law in the circumstances presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">In part II, we summarize the evidence in light of the applicable summary judgment standards. In this section, we describe the principles of summary judgment law which dictate how we must view the evidence at this procedural juncture.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-9\">Although summary judgment might no longer be considered a \u201cdisfavored\u201d procedure, (see, e.g., Henley, Action Guide, Making and Opposing a Summary Judgment Motion (Cont.Ed.Bar 1998) p. 15; Weil &amp; Brown, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group 1999) \u00b6 10:278, p. 10-108), the rule continues that the moving party\u2019s evidence must be strictly construed, while the opposing party\u2019s evidence must be liberally construed. \u201cBecause of the drastic nature of the summary judgment procedure, and the importance of safeguarding the adverse party\u2019s right to a trial, the moving party must make a strong showing. His affidavits are <em>strictly construed. </em>. . . [\u00b6] On the other hand, the affidavits of the party opposing the motion are <em>liberally </em>construed.\u201d (6 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (4th ed. 1997) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>Proceedings Without Trial, \u00a7 218, p. 630.) \u201cReflecting the \u2018cautious\u2019 judicial attitude about granting summary judgment . . . the declarations and evidence offered in opposition to the motion <em>must </em>be <em>liberally </em>construed, while the moving party\u2019s evidence must be construed <em>strictly, </em>in determining a \u2018triable issue\u2019 of fact.\u201d (Weil &amp; Brown, <em>supra, </em>\u00b6 10:309, p. 10-114.)</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">On a summary judgment motion, the court must therefore consider what inferences favoring the opposing party a fact finder could reasonably draw from the evidence. While viewing the evidence in this manner, the court must bear in mind that its primary function is to identify issues rather than to determine issues. (Cf., e.g., Weil &amp; Brown, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial, <em>supra, </em>\u00b6 10:270, p. 10-105 [citing cases].) Only when the inferences are indisputable may the court decide the issues as a matter of law. If the evidence is in conflict, the factual issues must be resolved by trial. \u201cAny doubts about the propriety of summary judgment ... are generally resolved <em>against </em>granting the motion, because that allows the future development of the case and avoids errors.\u201d (Henley, Action Guide, Making and Opposing a Summary Judgment Motion, <em>supra, </em>at p. 15.)</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">A defendant can qualify for summary judgment by showing that an element of plaintiff\u2019s cause of action cannot be established. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, subd. (o)(2); see also, e.g., Weil &amp; Brown Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial, <em>supra, </em>\u00b6 10:240, p. 10-85.) In the instant case, plaintiff is suing for breach of contract. The elements of plaintiff\u2019s cause of action therefore include contract formation and breach. (See, e.g., <em>Roddenberry </em>v. <em>Roddenberry </em>(1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 634, 654-655 [51 Cal.Rptr.2d 907] [plaintiff seeking contract recovery must plead and prove contract formation and breach].) Defendant here could therefore qualify for summary judgment by demonstrating, on the basis of undisputed facts, either a lack of contract formation or a lack of breach.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">In the context of a \u201cgood cause\u201d contract which is only implied by conduct over a period of time, formation and breach cannot always be temporally and otherwise neatly distinguished. Issues of contract formation and contract breach consequently tend to meld together. If an employee is fired for a particular cause, the employer might argue that the parties never formed a contract agreeing not to terminate for that particular cause (thus attacking the contract formation element). Or the employer might argue that the parties\u2019 contract classifies the particular cause in question as \u201cgood cause\u201d (thus attacking the breach element). Either argument, if factually supported, defeats the plaintiff\u2019s breach of contract claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">Even though plaintiff bears the burden of proof at trial, a moving defendant bears the initial burden of showing the lack of any triable factual issue. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>(See, e.g., <em>Pieper </em>v. <em>Commercial Underwriters Ins. Co. </em>(1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 1008, 1015 [69 Cal.Rptr.2d 551] [\u201cThe moving defendant bears the burden of proving the absence of any triable issue of material fact, even though the burden of proof as to a particular issue may be on the plaintiff at trial.\u201d].) A responding plaintiff has no evidentiary burden unless the moving defendant has first met its initial burden. (See, e.g., Weil &amp; Brown, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial, <em>supra, </em>\u00b6 10:249, 10:261, pp. 10-93, 10-99) Only after the moving defendant meets its initial burden does the burden shift to the plaintiff to demonstrate the existence of a triable issue. (See, e.g., <em>Pieper, supra, </em>at p. 1015.) Hence, in a motion such as the one involved here, the court must initially determine whether the moving party has presented evidence establishing that the contractual terms claimed by plaintiff never came into existence, or in the alternative has presented evidence establishing that the contractual terms that did come into existence were never breached.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">The trial court may not weigh the evidence in the manner of a fact finder to determine whose version is more likely true. (See, e.g., Weil &amp; Brown, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial, <em>supra, </em>\u00b6 10:272, pp. 10-105 to 10-106.) Nor may the trial court grant summary judgment based on the court\u2019s evaluation of credibility. (See, e.g., Weil &amp; Brown, <em>supra, \u00b6 </em>10:272.10 et seq, p. 10-107 et seq. [citing cases].) Nor may the trial court grant summary judgment for a defendant based simply on its opinion that plaintiff\u2019s claims are \u201cimplausible,\u201d if a reasonable factfinder could find for plaintiff on the evidence presented. (But see, e.g., Weil &amp; Brown, <em>supra, </em>\u00b6 10:260.10 et seq., p. 10-97 et seq. [discussing and distinguishing substantive \u201cimplausibility\u201d limitations on permissible inferences from circumstantial evidence in federal antitrust law].)</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">The court must consider not only the bare evidence, but also the reasonable inferences deducible from the evidence (see, e.g., Weil &amp; Brown, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial, <em>supra, </em>\u00b6 10:302, p. 10-112), and determine whether the evidence is sufficient to support a potential judgment in favor of the opposing party. (See, e.g., Weil &amp; Brown, <em>supra, </em>\u00b6 10:260, p. 10-97; <em>Rio Linda Unified School Dist. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 732, 739 [60 Cal.Rptr.2d 710] [\u201cUnder the new method for establishing a prima facie entitlement to summary judgment, the moving party must demonstrate a negative, i.e., that there <em>is no </em>evidence to support an element of the opponent\u2019s case. This is akin to the burden of an appellant in proving there is no substantial evidence in support of a judgment.\u201d]; cf. <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Liberty Lobby, Inc. </em>(1986) <em>All </em>U.S. 242, 247-248 [106 S.Ct. 2505, 2510, 91 L.Ed.2d 202] [applying federal law; \u201c. . . summary judgment will not lie if . . . the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>In view of these principles, we state the facts in part II below in the manner in which the evidence would permit the facts to be decided most favorably to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">b. <em>Whether \u201cgood cause\u201d can be determined on a summary judgment motion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">Plaintiff contends that the existence or absence of good cause to terminate is inherently an issue of fact which cannot be decided on summary judgment. The cases, however, hold otherwise. As a general matter, \u201c[l]ike other civil causes of action, wrongful discharge claims arising in contract or in tort may be susceptible of pretrial disposition on motions for summary judgment.\u201d <em>(Turner </em>v. <em>Anheuser-Busch, Inc. </em>(1994) 7 Cal.4th 1238, 1252 [32 Cal.Rptr.2d 223, 876 P.2d 1022].) Plaintiff in <em>Fowler </em>v. <em>Varian Associates, Inc. </em>(1987) 196 Cal.App.3d 34, 42 [241 Cal.Rptr. 539] also argued \u201cthat the existence of \u2018good cause\u2019 cannot be determined on a motion for summary judgment.\u201d The <em>Fowler </em>court ruled that the plaintiff\u2019s \u201cargument is not correct. (See, e.g., <em>Clutterham </em>v. <em>Coachmen Industries, Inc. </em>(1985) 169 Cal.App.3d 1223, 1227 [215 Cal.Rptr. 795]; <em>Crosier </em>v. <em>United Parcel Service, Inc. </em>(1983) 150 Cal.App.3d 1132, 1140 [198 Cal.Rptr. 361].)\u201d <em>(Fowler, supra, </em>196 Cal.App.3d at p. 42-43.) The court in <em>Fowler </em>ultimately held that \u201c[u]ndisputed facts establish that [the employer] had good cause to discharge Fowler.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 40.) Similarly, in <em>Knights </em>v. <em>Hewlett Packard </em>(1991) 230 Cal.App.3d 775, 780 [281 Cal.Rptr. 295], the court ruled that \u201c[w]hether Knights\u2019 performance was unacceptable and whether good cause for discharge existed are issues that may be determined on a summary judgment motion. <em>(Fowler </em>v. <em>Varian Associates, Inc., supra, </em>196 Cal.App.3d 34, 42-43.)\u201d (See also <em>Moore </em>v. <em>May Dept. Stores Co. </em>(1990) 222 Cal.App.3d 836 [271 Cal.Rptr. 841] [trial court correctly concluded that on facts presented there was good cause, as a matter of law, to terminate appellant]; cf. <em>Gonzales </em>v. <em>MetPath, Inc. </em>(1989) 214 Cal.App.3d 422 [262 Cal.Rptr. 654] [summary judgment upheld in discrimination case].)</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">Hence summary judgment can properly be granted for a defendant employer on a \u201cgood cause\u201d issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-9\">II. <em>Factual and procedural background.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b575-10\">Plaintiff and appellant Ian C. Binder was employed by Aetna for 30 years. At the time of his termination, plaintiff managed Aetna\u2019s Life Insurance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>Career Agent Unit in Encino, where he supervised about 10 life insurance sales agents. He had been employed in similar management positions with Aetna for about 15 years. He had an unblemished service record, and Aetna admitted that plaintiff was performing his job satisfactorily at the time of his termination. Prior to the Rancho Bernardo \u201cinvoice\u201d incident (described below), Aetna had no reason to doubt plaintiff\u2019s honesty and integrity.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">In November 1993, Aetna\u2019s national sales manager announced a \u201cVice President\u2019s December Challenge Award.\u201d Pursuant to this award program, sales managers who met a specified sales goal for the month of December would \u201cwin\u201d an excursion to a resort of their choice with a spouse or significant other, in the form of reimbursement of up to $300 for such purpose. Plaintiff was one of four out of eleven managers who qualified, and hence became entitled to a $300 \u201cbonus.\u201d The $300 bonus was earned compensation. This was proven by several factors. For example, these bonuses were to be $300 net, with the employee\u2019s taxes paid separately by the company so that the \u201cchecks will net $300,\u201d and the amount of the bonus was to be included in total income for proposes of pension calculations.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">In January 1994, Aetna reorganized its field offices and reduced its \u201cGeneral Manager\u201d positions from 11 to 7. Three individuals competed for the one position available in California: plaintiff, age 55, and two 42-year-olds. Despite what plaintiff claims to be his superior qualifications, one of the 42-year-old candidates was selected. Plaintiff was offered two alternatives: a severance package worth about $170,000 over nineteen months, or a new, potentially more lucrative, employment arrangement with compensation based largely on performance bonuses. Plaintiff preliminarily opted for the new arrangement, subject to a completed agreement on the details of the performance bonus program.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">Prior to the time of the reorganization, plaintiff understood that his immediate supervisor was a senior Aetna executive named Westley Thompson. It was Mr. Thompson with whom plaintiff was negotiating the new performance bonus program, and who had offered him the alternative severance package. In March, 1994, however, Mr. Thompson left Aetna, with the details of the performance bonus program still unresolved and with the severance package offer still open.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">In early 1994, plaintiff was contacted by a Connecticut-based Aetna executive named John Jones. Mr. Jones advised plaintiff that he, Mr. Jones, had really been plaintiff\u2019s supervisor for the preceding period, and ordered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>plaintiff to commence Aetna\u2019s periodic performance review process. According to Mr. Jones, this involved plaintiff\u2019s initially writing his own performance review, to be reviewed and adjusted as appropriate by Mr. Jones. Plaintiff took issue with this process, contending among other things that plaintiff had understood that Mr. Thompson, not Mr. Jones, was his supervisor. In particular plaintiff contended that Mr. Jones, remotely officed, did not have sufficient familiarity with plaintiff\u2019s work performance to enable Mr. Jones to fairly evaluate plaintiff. A confrontation between plaintiff and Mr. Jones escalated to a heated exchange, and to subsequent disagreements over the content of plaintiff\u2019s performance review.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">In March 1994, Mr. Jones traveled to Encino and, \u201cman to man,\u201d asked plaintiff why they did \u201cnot get along.\u201d Plaintiff opined that the reason was that Mr. Jones saw everything in black and white, while plaintiff saw \u201ca lot of gray.\u201d Plaintiff further opined that this situation was the product of Mr. Jones\u2019s military training. Mr. Jones thereupon \u201cwent ballistic and started yelling and screaming\u201d and said \u201c[e]verybody says that. It\u2019s not correct, and I resent that.\u201d The discussion became so heated that plaintiff chose to leave his own office. The relationship between plaintiff and Mr. Jones deteriorated from there. These events caused Mr. Jones to want to terminate plaintiff, but he had no legitimate reason to do so. When the Rancho Bernardo \u201cinvoice\u201d incident (described below) occurred, Mr. Jones seized upon it as a justification for terminating plaintiff, although his true reasons were simply his personal dislike for plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">In January 1994, plaintiff\u2019s home was badly damaged or destroyed in the Northridge earthquake. For the next several months, as some of the events described above unfolded, plaintiff and his wife lived with relatives and friends. After two months of such living arrangements, plaintiff decided to use his $300 bonus for a private weekend away with his wife. He rented a condominium in Redondo Beach for $500 in cash. However, the owner of the condominium did not provide a receipt because he did not want to report rental income for tax purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">Plaintiff then committed the error which now forms the asserted \u201cgood cause\u201d for termination of his 30-year employment. Having spent more than the $300 bonus he had already earned, but having no receipt, plaintiff prepared a Rancho Bernardo Inn letterhead in the form of an invoice, complete with entries for room charges, food charges, tax charges, a notation of payment by check, etc. He then submitted this document in order to trigger payment of his previously earned bonus. It is undisputed that this Rancho Bernardo \u201cinvoice\u201d was a fabrication, and that plaintiff and his wife had not stayed at the Rancho Bernardo Inn. The flagrancy of the fabrication is perhaps heightened by the detail which the \u201cinvoice\u201d contains.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>Later, in mitigation of his conduct, plaintiff pointed out that he was in fact entitled to a $300 bonus, and that he had never claimed from Aetna any sum to which he was not entitled. Despite Aetna\u2019s attempt to so characterize it, plaintiff had not submitted a falsified expense account claim. He was instead attempting to collect an earned bonus. Plaintiff contended that he had taken the weekend of relaxation as the bonus program contemplated by renting the condominium in Redondo Beach for $500, and hence was fully entitled to the money. Aetna identified no instance in which an award winner had not collected his prize, raising the inference that Aetna fully expected to pay the award in any event. Moreover, Aetna acknowledged that Aetna was indifferent as to where plaintiff and his wife took their weekend. Aetna identified no damage to it from the inaccurate reporting of where plaintiff had taken his weekend.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">Even before plaintiff learned that Aetna had instituted an investigation into the bona fides of the Rancho Bernardo \u201cinvoice,\u201d plaintiff realized he had made a mistake. He decided to withdraw the \u201cinvoice.\u201d He asked for its return, and was told it would be returned. Plaintiff planned instead to take extra time after an Aetna sales meeting at Hilton Head, and then to submit the invoices from the extended Hilton Head stay to collect his\" previously earned bonus.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">Mr. Jones, however, determined that he now had a plausible reason to terminate plaintiff. Mr. Jones contended that the Rancho Bernardo \u201cinvoice\u201d constituted \u201cthe fraudulent submission of an expense account,\u201d that it was \u201cfabricated\u201d and an attempt \u201cto deceive management,\u201d and that it \u201cconstituted unethical conduct.\u201d He purported to order an investigation into the bona fides of the \u201cinvoice.\u201d In his memo to an Aetna internal security auditor initiating the investigation, however, Mr. Jones advised the auditor that plaintiff was \u201ca difficult manager who routinely questions management practices and decisions.\u201d Mr. Jones also told the internal security auditor that plaintiff was a \u201cdifficult employee to manage, challenges raises, bonus awards, merit increases, etc.\u201d The disconnection between Mr. Jones\u2019s comments and the purportedly limited subject at hand\u2014the bona fides of the Rancho Bernardo \u201cinvoice\u201d\u2014suggests an inference that it was a foregone conclusion to Mr. Jones that plaintiff would be terminated due to Mr. Jones\u2019s dislike of plaintiff, and that the investigation was not intended to be an objective effort to evaluate the facts and seriousness of the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">Aetna\u2019s \u201cCode of Conduct\u201d is cited by Aetna itself as defining at least some of the terms of plaintiff\u2019s implied contract of employment. Plaintiff points out that this code provides that \u201c[e]mployees are responsible for . . . questioning what they don\u2019t understand or don\u2019t agree with,\u201d and for \u201cproviding feedback to the manager on the manager\u2019s performance in planning, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>coaching, reviewing and developing the employee . . . .\u201d The conduct of plaintiff criticized by Mr. Jones, therefore, is arguably conduct authorized or even required by Aetna\u2019s own code. Moreover, despite his initial comments to Aetna\u2019s internal auditor, Mr. Jones later testified at deposition that \u201cmy view of [plaintiff\u2019s] performance didn\u2019t change. His performance was immaterial to all this. His performance was fine.\u201d Jones also later stated that plaintiff\u2019s alleged assertiveness had \u201cnothing, zero, nada\u201d to do with the issue of the Rancho Bernardo \u201cinvoice.\u201d Mr. Jones nevertheless featured his opinion of plaintiff as \u201cdifficult,\u201d etc., prominently in his communications with the Aetna internal investigator.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">Mr. Jones also ordered an audit of plaintiff\u2019s actual expense account reports, as contrasted with the Rancho Bernardo \u201cinvoice\u201d submitted to obtain payment of an earned bonus. The audit showed no irregularities.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">On May 11, 1994, plaintiff received a termination letter from Aetna stating that he was being terminated for \u201cunethical conduct.\u201d Aetna\u2019s Code of Conduct, generally alleged by Aetna itself to make up part of the implied contract between Aetna and plaintiff, defines \u201cunethical conduct\u201d by stating that either a one-time warning or immediate termination is justified for \u201cunethical conduct: e.g., conduct which has caused a supervisor to question the employee\u2019s honesty and lose confidence in his/her ability to do the job . . . .\u201d (Underlining in original.) Although Mr. Jones testified that he questioned plaintiff\u2019s honesty after the Rancho Bernardo \u201cinvoice\u201d incident, there was no evidence that any supervisor had lost confidence in plaintiff\u2019s ability to do his job. To the contrary, this entire lawsuit exists only because plaintiff had done his job so well that he was one of four out of eleven eligible employees who had qualified for a bonus based on good performance. Had plaintiff performed more poorly, he would never have qualified for the bonus, would not have had the opportunity to engage in the misguided conduct which lead to his termination, and perhaps would still be employed. Moreover, Aetna admitted that plaintiff was performing satisfactorily at the time of his termination. Hence Aetna\u2019s stated reason for the termination\u2014\u201cunethical conduct\u201d\u2014did not coincide with the definition of \u201cunethical conduct\u201d in the manual which Aetna itself contends constituted part of the parties\u2019 implied contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">The termination letter further stated: \u201cMore specifically, your employment termination is based on your admission that you provided a fraudulent hotel bill to management for reimbursement.\u201d To the extent that this language was meant to suggest \u201creimbursement\u201d of a business expense, rather than \u201cpayment\u201d of an earned bonus, it is inaccurate. To the extent that this language was meant to suggest that the submission was \u201cfraudulent\u201d in the sense that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>plaintiff was attempting to obtain money to which he was not entitled, rather than to obtain payment of a bonus to which he was entitled, it is also inaccurate. Although the language of the termination letter may be consistent with Mr. Jones\u2019s initial characterization of the Rancho Bernardo \u201cinvoice\u201d incident as \u201cthe fraudulent submission of an expense account,\u201d the facts are indisputable that plaintiff\u2019s actions\u2014no matter how misguided\u2014were not an attempt to obtain reimbursement of a business expense, but rather an attempt to obtain payment of an earned bonus.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">No one other than Mr. Jones was asked about his opinion of plaintiff\u2019s honesty during Aetna\u2019s investigation, even though Mr. Jones\u2019s familiarity with plaintiff was limited. Plaintiff had never been accused of anything similar in the past, and Aetna\u2019s investigation showed that the Rancho Bernardo \u201cinvoice\u201d incident was an isolated event. Aetna gave no consideration to plaintiff\u2019s interest in continued employment, notwithstanding that plaintiff had worked for Aetna for 30 years and was 55 years of age.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">Other evidence bearing on the questions of what contract had impliedly been formed and whether Aetna had breached it suggested that no one previously had been terminated for any similar conduct, and that some had been more leniently treated for conduct which was arguably equally serious or, by some standards, even more serious. Aetna contended that it had consulted Aetna\u2019s legal department before terminating plaintiff, asking whether a termination would be consistent with Aetna\u2019s handling of past disciplinary cases. Aetna contended that it received legal advice that terminating plaintiff would be consistent with past practice, but refused to disclose the precise content of that legal advice or to identify the past instances of allegedly consistent discipline. Plaintiff points out that Aetna\u2019s Code of Conduct provides that plaintiff is entitled to equal treatment, and argues that no evidence shows such a drastic penalty applied in any comparable situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">Aetna also presented evidence that its Code of Conduct provides that \u201cfraud, dishonesty or criminal conduct involving Company operations is prohibited,\u201d that \u201cEmployees who fail to comply with the policies, procedures and standards in this Code of Conduct... are subject to disciplinary action, including possible dismissal or termination of their relationship with Aetna,\u201d that \u201cthere are situations where employees may be subject to termination without Progressive Discipline,\u201d etc. Aetna also presented evidence that its \u201chandbook\u201d entitled Working With You - Employee Handbook of Personnel Policies and Programs, which impliedly comprised part of the parties\u2019 implied contract, stated that \u201c[e]mployees whose actions violate company/department policy or are illegal can be immediately terminated.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>Plaintiff, however, countered that the handbook also states that \u201c[d]epending on the circumstances, department management may issue a one time warning.\u201d Neither party presented any more specific manual provisions or other evidence regarding whether an incident such as that involved here would qualify as good cause notwithstanding factors such as longevity of service, long-standing good performance, continuing good performance at the time of termination, plaintiff\u2019s entitlement to the $300 in any event, plaintiff\u2019s withdrawal of the \u201cinvoice\u201d before processing, etc., or whether these are the type of \u201ccircumstances\u201d which would require \u201ca one time warning.\u201d Plaintiff did present evidence that Aetna\u2019s stated policies concerning reimbursement of business expenses did not apply to the payment of earned bonuses.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">Plaintiff also presented evidence that the application for payment by another winner of the vice-president\u2019s December Challenge Award had been sent into processing without any invoices submitted, instead subject only to the submission of invoices later.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">Plaintiff also presented evidence of Aetna\u2019s handling of the Zoe Baird incident, arguing that Aetna\u2019s treatment of this incident evidenced a practice of not hewing strictly to the highly moralistic standard applied to plaintiff. For example, after Zoe Baird was reinstated as general counsel for Aetna after her nomination as Attorney General failed amid allegations of tax irregularities, Aetna\u2019s chairman stated \u201cI would say to the American public: Let he who is without sin cast the first stone . . . .\u201d Later, an internal memo circulated to Aetna management stating that \u201cAetna is not prepared to turn its back on an outstanding employee because a few of our customers hold us to a perfection standard that 99% of the population does not meet.\u201d Although the Zoe Baird incident is significantly distinguishable from the present incident in that the tax issues involved in the Baird incident involved events occurring outside the workplace, plaintiff implicitly argues that statements such as these contribute to the parties\u2019 implied understanding of what would constitute good cause to terminate, and suggest that Aetna would not apply strict moral standards to employee missteps. Plaintiff also contends that the Baird incident undercuts Aetna\u2019s claim that it had to terminate plaintiff because it was concerned about how the Rancho Bernardo \u201cinvoice\u201d incident would look if it were published in the Los Angeles Times. Plaintiff also emphasizes that his record was, but for the Rancho Bernardo \u201cinvoice\u201d incident, unblemished during his entire 30-year career.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">Early in the trial court proceedings, the judge remarked: \u201cIt\u2019s all about fairness. You fire a guy on an absolutely moral standard. . . . Mr. Binder gets fired on a pretty rigid moral standard. I think that this is fair evidence of pretext, fair evidence of good cause, fair evidence of a lot of stuff . . . I do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>think it\u2019s pertinent evidence and fair evidence about . . . whether Aetna means what it says and says what it means . . .You fired the guy. He was with you for 30 years, and you fired him on a very rigid, very rigid application of a . . . what I think 12 people are going to find a pretty minor point.\u201d Nevertheless, despite these initial observations, the trial court later granted summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">Plaintiff also presented evidence that after his termination, Aetna failed to repay to him $200 Aetna owed him for an airplane ticket and failed to pay him for accrued vacation time, thus suggesting continuing animus toward plaintiff. Despite the previous negotiations between plaintiff and Mr. Thompson, plaintiff received no severance payments.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">III. <em>Applicable contract law.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">The common law of contract controls here. (Cf. <em>Cotran </em>v. <em>Rollins Hudig Hall Internat., Inc. </em>(1998) 17 Cal.4th 93, 108 [69 Cal.Rptr.2d 900, 948 P.2d 412] [\u201cThe law of wrongful discharge is largely a creature of the common law.\u201d].) In the absence of an implied contract otherwise, Labor Code section 2922 would apply, plaintiff\u2019s employment would be \u201cat will,\u201d and Aetna could terminate him for any reason or for no reason. For purposes of its summary judgment motion, Aetna conceded that a contract not to terminate except for good cause had been formed. Although each side cited standard statements of the \u201cgood cause\u201d concept, each side also cited evidence which assertedly gave particularized content to the particular understanding of these parties. Determining what that particular understanding was requires the application of contract law.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">Some cases in the wrongful termination area have been chided on the view that they deviate from contract law.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Other cases contain summary passages <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>not expressly linked to contract law.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Nevertheless, all the cases are consistent with long-settled principles of contract law.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Some cases discuss the applicable principles of contract law in greater detail,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> while other cases discuss the contract principles in lesser detail, perhaps because these principles are so well settled.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Even in isolation, these principles suggest significant possibility of triable issues regarding the meaning of a contract, especially an implied contract, because of the varying reasonable inferences that can be drawn from conduct and ambiguous phrasing in policy manuals. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>Below we summarize the applicable rules, since they illustrate the existence of differing reasonable inferences that could be drawn in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">To form a contract, a manifestation of mutual assent is necessary. (Rest.2d Contracts, \u00a7 17 (hereafter Restatement).)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Mutual assent may be manifested by written or spoken words, or by conduct. (Rest., <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 19.) \u201cContracts are often spoken of as express or implied. The distinction involves, however, no difference in legal effect, but lies merely in the mode of manifesting assent. . . . assent may be manifested by words or other conduct . . . intention to make a promise may be manifested in language or by implication from other circumstances, including course of dealing or usage of trade or course of performance.\u201d (Rest., <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 4, com. a, p. 14; see also Civ. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1619 [contracts are either express or implied], and 1621 [\u201c \u2018An implied contract is one, the existence and terms of which are manifested by conduct.\u2019 . . . [\u00b6] The distinction between <em>express </em>and <em>implied in fact </em>contracts relates only to the <em>manifestation of assent, </em>both types are based on the expressed or apparent intention of the parties.\u201d (1 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (9th ed. 1987) Contracts, \u00a7 11, p. 46 (hereafter Witkin).) All contracts must be interpreted by the same rules. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1635.)</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">\u201cLike words, non-verbal conduct often has different meanings to different people. Indeed, the meaning of conduct not used as a conventional symbol[<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>] is more uncertain and more dependent on its setting than are words. A wide variety of elements of the total situation may be relevant to the interpretation of such conduct.\u201d (Rest., <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 19, com. a, p. 55.) \u201cThe meaning given to words or other conduct depends to a varying extent on the context and on the prior experience of the parties. Almost never are all the connotations of a bargain exactly identical for both parties; it is enough that there is a core of common meaning sufficient to determine their performances with reasonable certainty or to give a reasonably certain basis for an appropriate legal remedy. . . . But material differences of meaning are a standard cause of contract disputes, and the decision of such disputes necessarily requires interpretation of the language and other conduct of the parties in the light of the circumstances.\u201d (Rest., <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 20, com. b, p. 59.) Hence \u201c[a] contract may be explained by reference to the circumstances under which it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>made, and the matter to which it relates.\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1647; see also 1 Witkin, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 688, p. 621.)</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">\u201c. . . the actions of the parties may show conclusively that they have intended to conclude a binding agreement, even though one or more terms are missing or are left to be agreed upon. In such cases courts endeavor, if possible, to attach a sufficiently definite meaning to the bargain. [\u00b6] An offer which appears to be indefinite may be given precision by usage of trade or by course of dealing between the parties. Terms may be supplied by factual implication, and in recurring situations the law often supplies a term in the absence of agreement to the contrary.\u201d (Rest., <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 33, com. a, p. 92.)</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">\u201cMuch contract law consists of rules which may be varied by agreement of the parties. Such rules are sometimes stated in terms of presumed intention, and they may be thought of as implied terms of agreement. They often rest, however, on considerations of public policy rather than on manifestation of the intention of the parties.\u201d (Rest., <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 5, com. b, p. 16.) However, \u201cthe primary search is for a common meaning of the parties, not a meaning imposed on them by the law.\u201d (Rest., <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 201, com. c, p. 84.) \u201cA contract <em>must </em>be so interpreted as to give effect to the mutual intention of the parties as it existed at the time of contracting . . . .\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1636, italics added.) \u201c[T]he outward <em>manifestation </em>or <em>expression </em>of assent is controlling.\u201d (1 Witkin, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 119, p. 144.) A manifestation of assent may be found even though the moment of contract formation cannot be identified. (Rest., <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 22.)</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">Numerous principles of interpretation guide the search for the manifested intention of the parties. (See, e.g., Rest., <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 201 et seq.) Some that can have particular pertinence to an implied contract not to terminate except for good cause context are these: \u201cEnglish words [such as those which appear in an employment manual] are read as having the meaning given them by general usage, if there is one. This rule is a rule of interpretation in the absence of contrary evidence, not a rule excluding contrary evidence.\u201d (Rest., <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 202, com. e, p. 89.) \u201c. . . words and conduct are interpreted in the light of the circumstances .... A meaning consistent with all the circumstances is preferred to a meaning which requires that part of the context be disregarded. But the parties may have agreed to displace normal meanings . . . .\u201d (Rest., <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 202, com. h, p. 91.) Although the various rules of interpretation apply to all manifestations of intent, \u201c[t]hey apply only in choosing among reasonable interpretations. They do not override evidence of the meaning of the parties, but aid in determining meaning or prescribe legal effect when meaning is in doubt.\u201d (Rest., <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 203, com. a, p. 93.) \u201cA contract must receive such an interpretation as will make it. . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>reasonable ... if it can be done without violating the intention of the parties.\u201d (Civ. Code \u00a7 1643; see also 1 Witkin, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 690, p. 623.) \u201cIn the absence of contrary indication, it is assumed that each term of an agreement has a reasonable rather than an unreasonable meaning .... But parties are free to make agreements which seem unreasonable to others .... The search is for the manifested intention of the parties. . . .\u201d (Rest., <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 203, com. c, p. 94.)</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">\u201cStipulations which are necessary to make a contract reasonable . . . are implied, in respect to matters concerning which the contract manifests no contrary intention.\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1655; see also Rest., <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 204 [\u201cWhen the parties to a bargain sufficiently defined to be a contract have not agreed with respect to a term which is essential to a determination of their rights and duties, a term which is reasonable in the circumstances is supplied by the court.\u201d].)  Hence, if an employer and employee have manifested agreement to a contract not to terminate except for good cause, but the evidence does not establish any particularized agreement regarding whether the specific cause cited does or does not qualify, the court must supply a meaning which is reasonable under the circumstances. (See, e.g., <em>Cotran </em>v. <em>Rolling Hudig Hall Internat., Inc., supra, </em>17 Cal.4th 93 [no specific evidence of intended agreement otherwise, reasonable meaning supplied]; cf. <em>Moore </em>v. <em>May Dept. Stores Co., supra, </em>222 Cal.App.3d 836 [finding and applying agreed meaning for good cause].)</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">\u201cThe supplying of an omitted term is not technically interpretation, but the two are closely related; courts often speak of an \u2018implied\u2019 term. . . . [\u00b6] . . . The parties to an agreement may entirely fail to foresee the situation which later arises and gives rise to a dispute; they then have no expectations with respect to that situation, and a search for their meaning with respect to it is fruitless. Or they may have expectations but fail to manifest them, either because the expectation rests on an assumption which is unconscious or only partly conscious, or because the situation seems unimportant or unlikely, or because discussion of it might be unpleasant or might produce delay or impasse. [\u00b6] . . . [\u00b6] . . . Sometimes it is said that the search [for an omitted term or omitted meaning] is for the term the parties would have agreed to if the question had been brought to their attention. Both the meaning of the words used and the probability that a particular term would have been used if the question had been raised may be factors in determining what term is reasonable in the circumstances. But where there is in fact no agreement, the court should supply a term which comports with community standards of fairness and policy rather than analyze a hypothetical model of the bargaining process.\u201d (Rest., <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 204, coms. a, b and d, pp. 97-98.)</p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>\u201cA contract is to be interpreted according to the law and usage of the place where it is to be performed . . . .\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1646; see also Rest., <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 220.) \u201cUsage is a habitual or customary practice.\u201d (Rest., <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 219; see also 1 Witkin, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 696, p. 629.) \u201cStipulations which are necessary to make a contract. . . conformable to usage, are implied, in respect to matters concerning which the contract manifests no contrary intention.\u201d (Civ. Code \u00a7 1655.)  \u201cAn agreement or term thereof need not be stated in words if the parties manifest assent to it by other conduct, and such assent is often manifested by conduct in accordance with usage. . . . Whether a usage is reasonable may bear on the issue whether the parties contracted with reference to it, but if they did they are not in general forbidden to make agreements which seem unreasonable to others.\u201d (Rest., <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 220, com. c, p. 148.) \u201cLanguage and conduct are in general given meaning by usage rather than by the law, and ambiguity and contradiction likewise depend upon usage.\u201d (Rest., <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 220, com. d, p. 149.) \u201c. . . if there is a reasonable usage which supplies an omitted term and the parties know or have reason to know of the usage, it is a surer guide than the court\u2019s own judgment of what is reasonable.\u201d (Rest., <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 221, com. a, p. 151.) \u201cThe more general and well-established a usage is, the stronger is the inference that a party knew of or had reason to know of it. Similarly, the fact that a usage is reasonable may tend to show that the parties contracted with reference to it or that a particular party knew or had reason to know of it. Where the parties in fact agree to a usage, there is no general requirement that their usage seem reasonable to others; but where there is no agreement only a reasonable usage supplies an omitted term. What is reasonable for this purpose depends on the circumstances . . . .\u201d (Rest., <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 221, com. b, p. 152.)</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">General usages of trade and course of dealing may also supplement or explain an agreement. (Rest., <em>supra, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 222, 223; see also Civ. Code, \u00a7 1655; <em>Varni Bros. Corp. </em>v. <em>Wine World, Inc. </em>(1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 880 [41 Cal.Rptr.2d 740] [custom and usage supplying term of implied contract].)</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">IV. <em>The law applied to plaintiff\u2019s wrongful termination claim.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">Aetna stated that it assumed, for purposes of its summary judgment motion, that the parties had impliedly concluded a contract that plaintiff would not be terminated except for good cause.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Aetna\u2019s primary thrust was then to demonstrate that its reason for terminating plaintiff did amount to good cause. Aetna\u2019s motion contended that \u201c[t]here can be no question that Aetna had good cause to terminate Plaintiff\u2019s employment,\u201d based solely on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>the Rancho Bernardo \u201cinvoice\u201d incident. Aetna\u2019s beginning assumption did not include, however, any assumption about any particular content or meaning for \u201cgood cause\u201d to which these particular parties had impliedly agreed. A motion which begins on such an assumption is based on an unstable footing. As noted in the review of contract law above, different parties can agree to a different content for contractual terms in different situations. Only when there is insufficient evidence of a meaning placed on the term by the parties can the court supply a reasonable meaning pursuant to contract law. This principle is so bedrock that it has been solidified in statute. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1655; see also discussion above.)</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">The parties here, despite Aetna\u2019s initial assumption that a contract not to terminate except for \u201cgood cause\u201d existed, wisely did not rely wholly on abstract case law to supply a meaning for \u201cgood cause.\u201d Instead, they presented evidence of Aetna\u2019s Code of Conduct, Aetna\u2019s employee handbook, plaintiff\u2019s longevity and unblemished service record, Aetna\u2019s handling of other employee disciplinary issues, etc., to suggest content for the \u201cgood cause\u201d term impliedly agreed to by these parties. Implied contracts not to terminate except for good cause normally develop by accretion over extended periods. This is reflected in the types of conduct approved by case law as evidence of an implied agreement: longevity of service, promotions, awards, lack of criticism over time, and the like. It often may be the case that an employer and employee have not, gradually over an extended period, manifested assent to any specialized meaning of \u201cgood cause\u201d different from the general standards supplied by case law in the absence of manifestation of \u201ccontrary intention.\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1635.) Hence application of a \u201cdefault\u201d reasonable standard set by case law may be a proper application of contract law in most instances. Here we must consider, however, the evidence of meaning supplied by the parties and the inferences that might be drawn from that evidence. Moreover, since we review here a summary judgment, we must construe plaintiff\u2019s evidence liberally and accept all reasonable inferences which could be drawn by a trier of fact in favor of plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">Plaintiff relies heavily on <em>Cotran </em>v. <em>Rollins Hudig Hall Internat., Inc., supra, </em>17 Cal.4th 93. <em>Cotran </em>primarily considered the proper role of a jury in a wrongful termination case. <em>Cotran </em>decided that the jury\u2019s role did not extend to deciding whether the acts for which the employee was terminated actually occurred, but was instead limited to determining whether the employer had made a reasonable investigation and reasonably believed that the acts justifying termination had occurred. In the instant case, the acts for which plaintiff was terminated (the Rancho Bernardo Inn \u201cinvoice\u201d incident) are undisputed. Hence the primary thrust of <em>Cotran </em>is not involved in this case. <em>Cotran, </em>however, also discussed the meaning of \u201cgood cause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b589-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>What constitutes good cause in a particular setting can be a function of the parties\u2019 mutual agreement. (Civ. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1635, 1636,1655.) Since an agreement between the parties in this context is only implied from the surrounding circumstances and conduct, it follows that what constitutes good cause in a particular setting is similarly only implied from the surrounding circumstances and conduct. In order to determine what the parties have implicitly agreed will constitute good cause, it is therefore generally necessary to examine the circumstances in which the implied agreement arose, and the conduct which gave rise to that implied agreement. (See, e.g., <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Blue Cross of California </em>(1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 985 [6 Cal.Rptr.2d 184], [\u201cgood cause\u201d is relative; whether good cause exists depends upon the particular circumstances of each case], cited with approval in <em>Cotran </em>v. <em>Rollins Hudig Hall Internat., Inc., supra, </em>17 Cal.4th at p. 100.) Both sides in this case have recognized this proposition by presenting evidence of the circumstances involved here.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">The Supreme Court elaborated in <em>Cotran </em>that \u201cgood or just cause ... is <em>not. </em>reasons that are \u2018 \u201ctrivial, capricious, unrelated to business needs or goals, or pretextual.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Cotran </em>v. <em>Rollins Hudig Internat., Inc., supra, </em>17 Cal.4th at p. 96.)

Civ. Code \u00a7 1655), <em>Cotran </em>emphasized the need for latitude for managerial discretion, as noted above. In ultimate summary, the Supreme Court stated in <em>Cotran-. </em>\u201cWe give operative meaning to the term \u2018good cause\u2019 in the context of implied employment contracts by defining it, under the combined <em>Scott-Pugh </em>standard <em>(ante, </em>at p. 96), as fair and honest reasons, regulated by good faith on the part of the employer, that are not trivial, arbitrary or capricious, unrelated to business needs or goals, or pretextual.\u201d <em>(Cotran </em>v. <em>Rollins Hudig Hall Internat., Inc., supra, </em>17 Cal.4th at pp. 107-108.)</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">Our question, therefore, is whether the evidence in this summary judgment case eliminates all possibility of reasonable inference that, in this case, Aetna did not act for \u201cfair and honest reasons, regulated by good faith,\u201d and in accordance with the parties\u2019 manifested intentions. Put in the reciprocal, the question is whether the evidence presents the possibility that the Rancho Bernardo \u201cinvoice\u201d incident as a reason for termination was, viewed in light of all the circumstances as recited above, \u201ctrivial, arbitrary or capricious, unrelated to business needs or goals, or pretextual,\u201d and in breach of the parties\u2019 implied agreement. A jury could well draw inferences in favor of Aetna on these questions, and perhaps is most likely to do so. However, a reasonable jury could also draw inferences in favor of plaintiff on these questions. (See, e.g., <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Blue Cross of California, supra, </em>4 Cal.App.4th 985 [\u201cgood cause\u201d is relative; whether good cause exists depends upon the particular circumstances of each case]; cited with approval in <em>Cotran </em>v. <em>Rollins Hudig Hall Internat., Inc., supra, </em>17 Cal.4th at p. 100.)</p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>Aetna presented evidence of Aetna\u2019s internal operating policies and manuals, which had been provided to plaintiff. These generally prohibit \u201cdishonest\u201d conduct. Aetna offered this evidence to show that the Rancho Bernardo \u201cinvoice\u201d incident was within the meaning of \u201cgood cause\u201d applicable to this implied agreement. This evidence had considerable persuasive force in the sense that it could well sway a finder of fact. However, the terms of Aetna\u2019s general policies were not specific enough to conclusively establish, in the unique and apparently unanticipated circumstances presented, that the parties implicitly agreed that an incident such as the Rancho Bernardo \u201cinvoice\u201d incident would constitute good cause for termination notwithstanding all other considerations. Plaintiff presented evidence that he was a long term employee with an unblemished history of good performance. At-age 55, after 30 years of service, and in possession of a severance offer worth $170,000 and an alternative offer of continued employment potentially worth even more, he obviously had a strong interest in maintaining his employment. The Rancho Bernardo \u201cinvoice\u201d incident was an isolated event. Aetna did not present a \u201ccumulative\u201d case in support of termination, showing an aggregation of improper conduct eventually amounting to indisputable good cause. The \u201ccircumstances\u201d referenced in Aetna\u2019s manuals which would result in a warning rather than termination were not so clearly defined as to conclusively establish an implied agreement that termination would be warranted by these specific circumstances. Although all of plaintiff\u2019s business expense reimbursement requests were reviewed after the Rancho Bernardo \u201cinvoice\u201d incident, no irregularities were found. Aetna had no evidence that plaintiff presented any significant danger of dishonest conduct, or that plaintiff was in any way unfit to perform his duties. To the contrary, Aetna agreed that plaintiff was performing his duties satisfactorily. The money involved in the Rancho Bernardo \u201cinvoice\u201d incident was earned compensation. Plaintiff had claimed nothing from Aetna to which he was not entitled. Plaintiff had been assigned to a new supervisor shortly before the Rancho Bernardo \u201cinvoice\u201d incident, and had experienced conflicts with his supervisor over plaintiff\u2019s disagreement with his supervisor\u2019s managerial actions. Plaintiff\u2019s supervisor stated that he considered plaintiff to be \u201cdifficult\u201d to work with, allegedly as a consequence of these differences of opinion, notwithstanding that this had nothing to do with the Rancho Bernardo \u201cinvoice\u201d incident. There therefore was evidence that plaintiff\u2019s supervisor wanted to terminate him for reasons independent of the Rancho Bernardo \u201cinvoice\u201d incident. The evidence suggested that Aetna had handled other incidents quite differently, even though they were at least arguably comparable in important respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">Putting aside the claims of age discrimination, which are dealt with in the unpublished portion of this opinion, the evidence could reasonably support an inference that a termination for the Rancho Bernardo \u201cinvoice\u201d incident <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>was \u201ctrivial, arbitrary or capricious, unrelated to business needs or goals, or pretextual,\u201d that Aetna had not acted for \u201ca fair and honest cause or reason, regulated by good faith,\u201d and that a termination for the reason cited did not amount to good cause within the meaning of the parties\u2019 contract. Instead, an inference could be drawn that Aetna merely seized upon the Rancho Bernardo \u201cinvoice\u201d incident as a justification for terminating plaintiff, which Aetna wanted to do for other reasons, even though the parties\u2019 implied agreement would not classify this incident as serious enough to warrant termination in the face of other mitigating factors. In view of the possibility of such an inference, summary judgment should have been denied, even though this record suggests a significant possibility of a meritorious defense, and bearing in mind the trial court\u2019s duty to ensure that a jury does not simply usurp the managerial role.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b593-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>V., VI.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">VII. <em>Disposition.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">The summary judgment is reversed.

In my view, however, the issue is one of contract interpretation that should be resolved, if possible, by determining what the parties understood their agreement to be when they entered into it. To determine the parties\u2019 intent, a court or jury must examine all evidence relating to the formation of the implied agreement.\u201d <em>(Cotran </em>v. <em>Rollins Hudig Hall Internal, Inc., supra, </em>17 Cal.4th at p. 111 (cone. &amp; dis. opn. of Kennard, J.).)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b583-5\">See, e.g., <em>Malmstrom </em>v. <em>Kaiser Aluminum &amp; Chemical Corp. </em>(1986) 187 Cal.App.3d 299 [231 Cal.Rptr. 820]: \u201c \u2018[E]ven when the implied promise of continued employment is found, it is only a promise not to terminate the employment without \u201c . . some good reason.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Malmstrom, supra, </em>187 Cal.App.3d at p. 321, quoting from <em>Clutterham </em>v. <em>Coachman Industries, Inc. </em>(1985) 169 Cal.App.3d 1223 [215 Cal.Rptr. 795].) The proposition literally appears worded as if it were an immutable rule of law rather than a matter of potentially changeable contractual intent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b583-7\">The principles governing interpretation of statutes, as opposed to interpretation of contracts, illustrate the controlling nature of contract principles herd. Although it is a proper function of the courts to determine the meaning of a statute, and a proper function of the courts to evaluate the constitutionality of a statute, the courts may not properly simply abrogate a statute by declaring \u201ccommon law\u201d rules contrary to a statute, since this would violate the separation of powers clause of the California Constitution. (Cal. Const, art. III, \u00a7 3; 7 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (9th ed. 1988) Constitutional Law, \u00a7 107 et seq., p. 159 et seq.) Pertinent to the present inquiry is Labor Code section 2922, which provides that \u201c[a]n employment, having no specified term, may be terminated at the will of either party on notice to the other.\u201d This section establishes that an employment is at will unless <em>the parties </em>have agreed otherwise. (See, e.g., <em>Foley </em>v. <em>Interactive Data Corp. </em>(1988) 47 Cal.3d 654, 677 [254 Cal.Rptr. 211, 765 P.2d 373].) Although <em>the parties </em>may alter or eliminate the effect of this statute by their agreement, the Constitution, Supreme Court precedents and statutorily mandated rules of construction make clear that a court may not alter or eliminate it by judicial deletion or insertion. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1858 [office of judge is simply to ascertain and declare what is contained in statute, not to insert what has been omitted or to omit what has been inserted]; <em>Manufacturers Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1995) 10 Cal.4th 257 [41 Cal.Rptr.2d 220, 895 P.2d 56] [\u00a7 1858 a \u201cmandate\u201d of statutory construction; \u201cfundamental principle\u201d is that statute is \u201cto be applied according to its terms\u201d]; <em>California Fed.

Co. </em>v. <em>Scottsdale Ins. Co. </em>(1997) 54 Cal.App.4th 121 [62 Cal.Rptr.2d 620] [summarizing authorities].) These cases make clear that a court may not simply alter or qualify the \u201cat will\u201d employment statute as a matter of supposed law, and no case has been found in which a court has purported to do so. Instead, the cases are all consistent with the application of well-settled principles of contract interpretation, although not all cases repeat the applicable rules of contract interpretation in detail before applying them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b583-9\">(See, e.g., <em>Foley </em>v. <em>Interactive Data Corp., supra, </em>47 Cal.3d 654.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b583-10\">(Cf. <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1989) 215 Cal.App.3d 1103, 1109 [263 Cal.Rptr. 787] [Arabian, 1, applying \u201cwell-established principles of contract law\u201d in wrongful termination case].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b584-6\">California courts often take guidance on contract issues from the Restatement.

He argues that even if the incident constituted good cause, Aetna might subjectively and secretly have harbored some other motivation for his termination, a motivation that\u2014standing alone\u2014did not constitute good cause. He argues that the Rancho Bernardo \u201cinvoice\u201d incident, even if accepted as good cause, might have been a pretext for allowing Aetna to terminate him for some secret non-good-cause reason. Hence he argues that a jury should be allowed to determine whether Aetna actually terminated him for a hidden non-good-cause reason, even if Aetna did have good cause to terminate. Plaintiff draws this argument largely from the definition and treatment of the \u201cgood cause\u201d concept in case law. (See, e.g., <em>Pugh </em>v. <em>See\u2019s Candies, Inc., supra, </em>116 Cal.App. 311, 329 <em>(Pugh I) </em>[\u201cAppellant may attack the employer\u2019s offered explanation ... on the ground that it is pretextual . . . and that the real reason is one prohibited by contract. . . .\u201d]; <em>Cotran </em>v. <em>Rollins Hudig Hall Internat., Inc., supra, </em>17 Cal.4th 93, 96 [good or just cause is <em>not </em>\u201creasons that are \u2018 \u201ctrivial, capricious, unrelated to business needs or goals, or pretextual\u201d \u2019].) Plaintiff\u2019s argument seizes on the \u201cpretextual\u201d terminology, and summarizes it as this: even if an employer had indisputable good cause to terminate, a jury nevertheless must decide whether the good cause reason was the \u201creal\u201d reason. The jury may decide that the good cause reason was not the \u201creal\u201d motivation for the termination. If the good cause reason was not the \u201creal\u201d reason for the termination, then the good cause reason was pretextual, and the employer is liable even though it did have good cause to terminate. This argument finds support in the semantics of the case law defining and expounding upon the \u201cgood cause\u201d concept as noted above. However, this argument also has problematic implications if accepted. The cases uniformly emphasize that care must be taken not to interfere with the legitimate exercise of managerial discretion. (See, e.g., <em>Cotran, </em>v. <em>Rollins Hudig Hall Internat., Inc., supra, </em>17 Cal.4th at p. 101 [\u201c <em>\u2018Although the jury must assess the legitimacy of the employer\u2019s decision to discharge, it should not be thrust into a managerial role.\u2019 </em>\u201d]; <em>Pugh I, supra, </em>116 Cal.App.3d at p. 330.) Plaintiff\u2019s argument appears to conflict with these directives by requiring jury redetermination of most, if not virtually all, reasons for termination, no matter how clearly good cause might exist. For example, a hypothetical terminated employee who punched a coworker, causing her significant facial injuries, could nevertheless go to the jury on his evidence of friction with his supervisor and his theory that the supervisor simply wanted to eliminate possible eventual competition from a highly competent subordinate. Being highly competent, would go the argument, is not good cause for termination. Hence if that was the \u201creal\u201d reason for the termination, rather than punching the coworker, the jury could find the employer liable even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>though the employee did punch the coworker. On this type of reasoning (many other hypothetical could be constructed), many if not most terminations could be driven to trial by resourceful counsel, regardless of the indisputable existence of good cause. (Cf., e.g., BAJI No. 2.01 [\u201cThe testimony of one witness worthy of belief is sufficient to prove any fact.\u201d].) Yet the Supreme Court stated in a related context in <em>Cotran </em>that \u201c. . . a standard permitting juries to reexamine the factual basis for the decision to terminate for misconduct\u2014typically gathered under the exigencies of the workaday world and without benefit of the slow-moving machinery of a contested trial\u2014dampens an employer\u2019s willingness to act, intruding on the \u2018wide latitude\u2019 the court in <em>Pugh II </em>[, <em>supra, </em>203 Cal.App.3d 743] recognized as a reasonable condition for the efficient conduct of business.\u201d <em>(Cotran </em>v. <em>Rollins Hudig Hall Internat., Inc., supra </em>17 Cal.4th at pp. 105-106.) Hence it seems unlikely that the term argued for by plaintiff would be supplied by a court as a \u201creasonable\u201d implied term of a contract. (Cf. Civ. Code, \u00a7 1654.) We do not answer here the question of whether an employee may recover for a termination, notwithstanding the indisputable existence of good cause to terminate, on the theory that the indisputable good cause was a \u201cpretext\u201d for a non-good-cause reason. This case presents the preliminary question of whether the cause for termination cited by the employer (the Rancho Bernardo \u201cinvoice\u201d incident) was or was not good cause within the meaning of the parties\u2019 implied contract. If it was not, the employee will prevail. If it was, the issue of whether the employee can nevertheless prevail on the \u201cpretext\u201d theory can be more fully developed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b593-11\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 832.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"b593-12\">Judge of the Los Angeles Superior Court, assigned by the Chief Justice pursuant to article VI, section 6 of the California Constitution.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
