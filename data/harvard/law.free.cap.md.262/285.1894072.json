Orrison [the appellant] , proprietor, hat stored in his yard large numbers of refrigerators, washing machines and other appliances. In no case, so far as I have been able to determine, have these appliances been rendered safe by removal of doors or of door latches, or in other ways prevention of the doors closing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-9\">\u201cThis is a very dangerous situation. The Fort Foote Elementary School and Kindergarten is less than 200 yards away, where many hundreds of little children attend school. This situation has been brought to attention of County officials repeatedly over a long period of time, but no adequate corrections have taken place. I wonder if our officials are waiting for one or more children to be suffocated before this matter is remedied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-10\">\u201cPrince George\u2019s County Ordinance Section 12-8 <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> may apply, according to your attorney Mr. Albert Lochte. I spoke also to State\u2019s Attorney assistant, Mr. Kenkel, who advised me that he thought a prosecution under this section under the circumstances could succeed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>\u201cAt my request, Officer Sellman of the Oxon Hill Station visited the premises last Tuesday or Wednesday, as I recall. He reported to me that he did not believe the situation violated the ordinance because: (a) Most of the refrigerators and other appliances stored outside were behind a four-foot high cattle fence; (b) Those outside the fence did not have mechanical latches, but the refrigerator doors were held shut by magnetic catches; and (c) after his first visit these refrigerators \u2014 some 6 to 8 of them \u2014were faced toward each other making it difficult for a child to get into them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-5\">\u201cDuring the past few days, Mr. Orrison has constructed an 8 foot board fence with a gate between Oxon Hill Road and his open storage area for these refrigerators. Officer Sellman told me that he had a colored man watchman on the premises when he arrived there between 6:00 p.m. and 7:00 p.m. I am advised that the watchman sleeps at his home some 200 yards distant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-6\">(The 4-foot cattle fence enclosure of a score or more refrigerators was built about two years ago as a palliative after complaint was made to Md-Nat\u2019l P&amp;PC.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-7\">\u201cOrdinance Section 12-8 may need clarification with respect to magnetic latches as well as mechanical latches. (Please see enclosed materials which make it clear that such refrigerators are a definite menace to little children.) If this section needs clarification as to what is meant by \u2018immediate supervision\u2019 by a responsible adult, I request that such revision also be made.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-8\">I do not think that the language of the ordinance should remain so unclear that an officer such as Mr. Sellman cannot interpret it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-9\">\u201cAs a matter of fact, Officer Sellman told me that he was aware of another business property on Central Avenue where conditions were at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>least as bad as those at 8400 Oxon Hill Road. I am not critical of Officer Sellman, who I believe was doing the best he could under the circumstances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-5\">\u201cThere is no question in my mind that the Ordinance Section 12-8 makes no distinction between refrigerators and other appliances behind cattle fences or board fences, and I don\u2019t think such a distinction should be made. Yet it appears that such jerry-made substitutes for compliance with the law are being substituted by Md-P&amp;PC. While it may serve as a minor deterrent to danger, I apprehend that it is in the long run a very unsatisfactory substitute for safety.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-6\">\u201cMr. Orrison\u2019s newly built 8-foot board fence is likewise an attempt to circumvent the law. Access to his junkyard storage of refrigerators \u2014 40 or more \u2014 may also be had by children from the sides and rear of the 8400 Oxon Hill Road property where nothing more than a decrepit 4-foot cattle fence is found. This is no safeguard that we should be satisfied with.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-7\">\u201cIf the County Commissioners are satisfied that such fencing of refrigerators, and other such appliances is safe, contrary to the findings of the federal government and the National Safety Council, this should be spelled out in the Ordinance, and the law should apply equally to everyone. If this is not safe, then Mr. Orrison should be required to comply with the law to protect the lives of little children in the neighborhood, since he apparently will not do so otherwise.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-8\">\u201cI might also mention that the very conscientious Justice of the Peace at the Oxon Hill Police Station where I went to swear out a warrant also found difficulty with Ordinance Section 12-8.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-9\">\u201cTherefore, the buck stops with you, our Board of County Commissioners, to make appropriate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>investigation of this situation and to take remedial action of (a) amendment of the Ordinance of (b) enforcement of the Ordinance, or both. Perhaps all that is necessary is to use the Zoning Ordinance. The premises is a non-conforming use, with nothing in the non-conforming use apparently permitting outdoor storage of refrigerators and electric appliances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-5\">Yours truly,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-6\">/s/ James F. Vance</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A9T\"><em>\u201cA </em>collection of authoritative references is enclosed.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">On 10 December 1969 Orrison sued Vance \u201cfor slander, libel and defamation of character.\u201d Thereafter Vance took Orrison\u2019s deposition and Orrison took Vance\u2019s depor sition. In April 1970, on Orrison\u2019s suggestion and affidavit, the case was removed to the Circuit Court for Calvert County. On 23 September the case came on for a hearing before the trial judge, Bowen, J., on Vance\u2019s motion for summary judgment. From the granting of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>motion and the ensuing judgment for costs, Orrison has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">Vance, a member of the bar, is employed by the federal government. He devotes a part of his spare time to a law practice which is confined to his neighborhood. He is active in civic affairs and he has been president of a local citizens\u2019 association. As he put it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-6\">\u201cIf I were to go back for the years I lived in Prince George\u2019s County and tell you how many instances we have requested the County officials to investigate problems and to take remedial action, it would take a half-hour\u2014things about roads, things about garbage collection, things about school bus service. That\u2019s the normal interest * * * of persons who are concerned about improving the quality of their community.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">Prior to his letter to the county Vance asked an Associate County Attorney if there was a law relating to the storage of refrigerators. He was told there was such a law.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He made it his business to get in touch with the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s office and with the county police whom he informed of possible violations of the law by Orrison. Both agencies inspected Orrison\u2019s premises and, we were told, neither of them found any violations of the law as it then existed. After he wrote the letter to the Commissioners he discussed the matter with neighbors who shared his concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>Inquiry must be directed first to the question whether there exists a genuine dispute of a material fact, and then to the question whether Vance was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Maryland Rule 610. In our consideration of these questions we have looked upon the evidence which was before Judge Bowen in a light most favorable to Orrison and we have resolved all logical and reasonable inferences deducible therefrom against Vance. <em>Brown v. Suburban Cadillac, </em>260 Md. 251, 255 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">Our review of the record has not persuaded us that there is a genuine dispute as to a material fact. Orrison has set forth in his brief a list of \u201cdisputed facts.\u201d No useful purpose will be served by a discussion of them. Some are mere semantic quibbles; others concern only conclusions of law; of the few that might be considered \u201cgenuine\u201d disputes none, in our judgment, is material.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">Firmly established is the notion that some communications, otherwise libelous, may be privileged, either absolutely or qualifiedly. <em>Stevenson v. Baltimore Baseball Club, Inc., </em>250 Md. 482 (1968). Since we think the words spoken and written by Vance enjoyed, in these circumstances, a qualified privilege it will not be necessary for us to consider or discuss the question whether his words were libelous.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">That some words need saying is a notion which has ancient validity but the qualified privilege which usually attends their saying must be exercised in a reasonable manner and for a proper purpose for if the speaker abuses the occasion of their utterance he will forfeit his immunity. The controlling principles of this phase of'the law have been stated with clarity and precision in two recent cases, <em>Stevenson v. Baltimore Baseball Club, Inc., supra, </em>and <em>Wetherby v. Retail Credit Co., </em>235 Md. 237 (1964), so we shall not repeat them here.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">Our inquiry begins with the subsidiary question whether the information itself and those who received it are of a kind and character which will allow Vance to claim privilege. In this regard we look to the relationship between Vance and the recipients, the legal, moral or so<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>cial duty impelling him to transmit the information, and whether he did so in good faith. <em>Simon v. Robinson, </em>221 Md. 200 (1959); <em>Fresh v. Cutter, 73 </em>Md. 87 (1890). Undoubtedly there are many varieties of situations in any of which the conditional or qualified privilege might arise, W. Prosser, <em>Law of Torts </em>\u00a7\u00a7 593-612 (1964), and were we obliged to fit the instant case into a convenient and recognizable slot we think it will be found in Restatement, <em>Torts </em>\u00a7 598:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-5\">\u201cAn occasion is conditionally privileged when the circumstances induce a correct or reasonable belief that</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-6\">(a) facts exist which affect a sufficiently important public interest, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-7\">(b) the public requires the communication of the defamatory matter to a public officer or private citizen and that such person is authorized or privileged to act if the defamatory matter is true.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">Vance saw what to him was a \u201cvery dangerous situation.\u201d Orrison insists Vance put it much too high, perhaps even bending the truth to some extent. Whether Vance\u2019s observation of the condition of Orrison\u2019s property was sufficiently comprehensive or whether he related what he did see with reasonable accuracy is somewhat beside the point. The question is not whether Orrison obeyed the law but whether Vance was justified in saying what he did say. The letter clearly reveals that Vance thought there was still some danger in the situation, since Orrison\u2019s efforts in this regard were inadequate and at best amounted only to pro forma compliance with the law. Even more significant, however, is Vance\u2019s insistence that, despite Orrison\u2019s pro forma compliance, the law ought to be changed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He was trying to eliminate what he thought was a very real danger and we are quite unwilling to say that he was not justified in thinking that the danger still existed. Moreover, the State\u2019s At<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>torney, the police, the commissioners and their attorney were certainly reasonable recipients of the communications and the citizens to whom he spoke shared his interest in obviating the danger. <em>Simon v. Robinson, </em>supra; <em>Fresh v. Cutter, supra. </em>We think his efforts in this regard were conditionally privileged.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">Orrison, of course, argues that because Vance\u2019s statements were made with \u201cactual malice\u201d he has forfeited his immunity. <em>Henthorn v. Western Md. Ry. Co., </em>226 Md. 499 (1961); <em>Stevenson, supra; Fresh, supra. </em>But Orrison has the burden of proving not only actual malice but also that the statements are false. <em>Wetherby, supra. </em>And he argues also that ordinarily actual malice is a jury question, and we agree, <em>Stevenson, supra; </em>50 Am.Jur.2d, <em>Libel and Slander </em>\u00a7 198, but we see nothing in this record which suggests the presence of actual malice sufficient to defeat Vance\u2019s privilege or even to justify the submission of the issue to a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">It has been said that no word in the law is used more loosely than the word \u201cmalice,\u201d 1 Harper and James, <em>The Law of Torts </em>\u00a7 5.27, 450 (1956), and quite likely this is true. Perhaps, in this context, a more precise expression would be \u201cabuse of privilege.\u201d Significant in rebutting privilege is the speaker\u2019s motive which</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-7\">\u201c* * * must be some motive inconsistent with the social policy which gives rise to privilege and which affords prima facie immunity to the defendant. If it appears that the defendant has attempted to use the circumstances and the occasion for a purpose not within that for which the immunity is extended, the privilege is abused and he is liable. And this is as it should be. If the communication is made, not at all for the purpose of protecting interests legally recognized, nor in the performance of a duty which the law encourages, \u2018the pretense under which it is made, instead of furnishing a defense, will aggravate the case.\u2019 <em>[Fairman v. Ives, </em>5 B. &amp; Ald. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>642, 106 Eng. Rep. 1325, 1328 (1822).] It is thus seen that \u2018actual malice\u2019 really does not exclusively mean ill-will. It is better described as an improper purpose, i.e., a purpose inconsistent with the social policy which it is the purpose of the law to secure by the technical device of privilege.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 452.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">We have said that, in this context, malice means \u201ca reckless disregard of truth, the use of unnecessarily abusive language, or other circumstances which would support a conclusion that the defendant acted in an ill-tempered manner or was motivated by ill-will.\u201d <em>Stevenson, supra </em>at 487. In determining an abuse of privilege all relevant circumstances are admissible, <em>Foley v. Hoffman, </em>188 Md. 273 (1947), including the defendant\u2019s reasonable belief in the truth of his statements, <em>Simon, supra, </em>the excessive nature of the language used, <em>Stevenson, supra, Fresh, supra, </em>whether the disclosures were unsolicited, <em>id., </em>and whether the communication was made in a proper manner and only to proper parties, <em>Kennedy v. Cannon, </em>229 Md. 92 (1962). Of course, any relevant specific facts in support of the factors just mentioned and any other evidence of abuse or the absence of abuse are admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">All that Orrison has come up with is the fact that Vance does not like him, pointing to other litigation, <em>Price v. Orrison, </em>261 Md. 8 (1971), and Vance\u2019s statement to that effect.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Clearly Orrison is not a hero to Vance and there is little doubt Orrison considers Vance a low fellow. But, in these circumstances, this is not evidence of ill-will. Had this been an isolated case of \u201ccivic concern,\u201d completely without foundation and following a re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>cent acrimonious confrontation, we might find it difficult to put aside the possibility of ill-will. But Vance\u2019s record over the years of bringing to light all kinds of community problems puts the matter in a somewhat different context. It is common knowledge that unused refrigerators accessible to children are dangerous and that this is an area of legitimate public concern. Much is made of the fact that Orrison did improve the fencing but it is clear, we think, that this is not the complete answer.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Children have been known to get over, under, through and around fences. As we see it there is little or no significance in the fact that there was no love lost between Orrison and Vance.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">We see no reason for disturbing the judgment entered by Judge Bowen.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">\n<em>Costs to be paid by the appellant.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b307-11\">.
