Vol.) Art. 27, \u00a7 534H (c) (3) (a portion of what is sometimes known as the Prince George\u2019s County \u201cBlue Law\u201d). Rebe and Arlan\u2019s have appealed, assigning as error the trial court\u2019s exclusion of evidence proffered in support of their contention that the Blue Law\u2019s scheme of classification is irrational and arbitrary and contending that because the classification is arbitrary, the law is violative of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b371-11\">Art. 27, \u00a7 492 to \u00a7 534M is a mosaic of Sunday clos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>ing laws, accumulated under the subtitle \u201cSABBATH BREAKING.\u201d Although the General Assembly had enacted similar restrictions as early as 1649, 1 Archives of Maryland 244 (1883), Art. 27, \u00a7 492, which prohibits \u201cbodily labor\u201d throughout the State on Sunday, seems to have stemmed from Chapter XVI, \u00a7 10 of an Act passed by the General Assembly on 26 October 1723, Bacon, <em>Laws of Maryland </em>(1765) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-5\">\u201cAnd be it Enacted, That no Person whatsoever, shall Work, or do any bodily Labour on the Lord\u2019s Day, commonly called Sunday, and that no Person, having Children, Servants or Slaves, shall command, or wittingly or willingly suffer any of them to do any Manner of Work or Labour on the Lord\u2019s Day, (Works of Necessity and Charity always excepted) nor shall suffer or permit any Children, Servants or Slaves, to profane the Lord\u2019s Day, by Gaming, Fishing, Fowling, Hunting, or unlawful Pastimes or Recreations: And that every Person transgressing this Act, and being thereof convict, by the Oath of one sufficient Witness, or Confession of the Party before a single Magistrate, shall forfeit Two Hundred Pounds of Tobacco to be levied and applied as aforesaid.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">Onto \u00a7 492 has been engrafted the myriad of exceptions and variations which now applies to the several counties, cities and towns of Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">The section at issue here, Art. 27, \u00a7 534H provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-8\">\u201c(a) In Prince George\u2019s County, except as specifically in this section otherwise provided, it is unlawful on Sunday for any wholesale or retail establishment to conduct business for labor or profit in the usual manner and location or to operate its establishment in any manner for the general public. It shall not cause, direct, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>permit, or authorize any employee or agent to engage in or conduct business on its behalf on Sunday.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-5\">(b) Notwithstanding any provision of this section, the operation of any of the following types of retail establishments is allowed on Sunday.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-6\">1. Drugstores whose principal business is the sale of drugs and related items.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-7\">2. Delicatessens whose principal business is the sale of delicatessens and related food items.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-8\">3. Bakeries and bakeshops.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-9\">4. Gasoline stations whose principal business is the sale of gasoline, oil, and other automobile maintenance items.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-10\">(c) Nothing in this section applies to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-11\">1. Farmers</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-12\">2. Nurserymen</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-13\">3. <em>Small business with not more than six (6) persons on any one shift with the exception of persons or retailers engaged in the sale of motor vehicles. </em>(Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-14\">It is not surprising that a subject as complicated and as controversial as the regulation of Sunday observance, as we noted in <em>Patton v. Graves, </em>244 Md. 528, 532, 224 A. 2d 411 (1966), should \u201chave generated much work for the courts and unceasing turmoil in the General Assembly.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Anne Arundel County Sunday Observance Law, Art. 27, \u00a7 521, survived a constitutional challenge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>in this Court, <em>McGowan v. State, </em>220 Md. 117, 151 A. 2d 156 (1959) and in the Supreme Court of the United States, <em>McGowan v. Maryland, </em>366 U. S. 420, 81 S. Ct. 1101, 6 L.Ed.2d 393 (1961). <em>Richards Furniture Corp. v. Board of County Comm\u2019rs of Anne Arundel County, </em>233 Md. 249, 196 A. 2d 621 (1963) mounted an unsuccessful attack on the constitutionality of Art. 27, \u00a7 521 (b) which permitted Sunday operation of retail establishments in Anne Arundel, Kent, Queen Anne\u2019s and Talbot Counties where not more than one person, other than the proprietor, was employed. One might suppose that <em>McGowan, </em>in which an attack on the Anne Arundel County Blue Law was unsuccessful, and <em>Richards, </em>involving the validity of a provision similar to the one here involved, would be dispositive of the issue in this case. Chief Justice Warren, speaking for the majority in <em>McGowan, </em>described Maryland\u2019s statutory scheme:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-5\">\u201cThe remaining statutory sections concern a myriad of exceptions for various counties, districts of counties, cities and towns throughout the State. Among the activities allowed in certain areas on Sunday are such sports as football, baseball, golf, tennis, bowling, croquet, basketball, lacrosse, soccer, hockey, swimming, softball, boating, fishing, skating, horseback riding, stock car racing and pool or billiards. Other immunized activities permitted in some regions of the State include group singing or playing of musical instruments; the exhibition of motion pictures; dancing; the operation of recreation centers, picnic grounds, swimming pools, skating rinks and miniature golf courses. The taking of oysters and the hunting or killing of game is generally forbidden, but shooting conducted by organized rod and gun clubs is permitted in one county. In some of the subdivisions within the State, the exempted Sunday activities are sanctioned throughout the day; in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>others, they may not commence until early afternoon or evening; in many, the activities may only be conducted during the afternoon and late in the evening. Certain localities do not permit the allowed Sunday activity to be carried on within one hundred yards of any church where religious services are being held.\u201d 366 U. S. at 424</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">The Court concluded that despite the complicated exceptions, there was no infringement of equal protection, because there was nothing in the record to indicate that the General Assembly acted unreasonably in setting up the classifications. On this point, the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-6\">\u201cThe standards under which this proposition is to be evaluated have been set forth many times by this Court. Although no precise formula has been developed, the Court has held that the Fourteenth Amendment permits the States a wide scope of discretion in enacting laws which affect some groups of citizens differently than others. The constitutional safeguard is offended only if the classification rests on grounds wholly irrelevant to the achievement of the State\u2019s objective. State legislatures are presumed to have acted within their constitutional power despite the fact that, in practice, their laws result in some inequality. A statutory discrimination will not be set aside if any state of facts reasonably may be conceived to justify it. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-7\">\u201cIt would seem that a legislature could reasonably find that the Sunday sale of the exempted commodities was necessary either for the health of the populace or for the enhancement of the recreational atmosphere of the day \u2014that a family which takes a Sunday ride into the country will need gasoline for the automobile and may find pleasant a soft drink or fresh fruit; that those who go to the beach may wish <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>ice cream or some other item normally sold there; that some people will prefer alcoholic beverages or games of chance to add to their relaxation; that newspapers and drug products should always be available to the public.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-5\">\u201cThe record is barren of any indication that this apparently reasonable basis does not exist, that the statutory distinctions are invidious, that local tradition and custom might not rationally call for this legislative treatment.\u201d 366 U. S. at 425-26 <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">It was the phrase \u201clocal tradition and custom,\u201d in the last paragraph of the quotation, which caught the appellants\u2019 eyes. What they attempted to do was to show that other stores in the Bowie area, employing no more than six persons, operated on Sunday and sold the same lines of merchandise as those sold by Arlan\u2019s and that \u201cthe customs and habits of the people of Prince George\u2019s County are such as favor the Sunday operation.\u201d From this they would project an argument that local tradition and custom do not offer rational support for the classification which the legislature made.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>Assuming, for the purposes of this opinion, that the proffered testimony should have been admitted, it still would not have won the day. Although <em>Richards, supra, </em>dealt with Art. 27, \u00a7 521 (b), which allowed an establishment with not more than one employee other than the proprietor to remain open on Sunday, while Art. 27, \u00a7 534H allows a \u201c[s]mall business with not more than six (6) persons on any one shift\u201d to remain open, what we said in <em>Richards </em>is apposite here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-5\">\u201c* * * In the recent case of <em>McGowan v. Maryland, </em>366 U. S. 420, wherein the Supreme Court affirmed a decision of this Court <em>(McGowan v. State, </em>220 Md. 117, 151 A. 2d 156) that Court pointed out that the stipulation in Section 521 that permits shops with only one employee to remain open on Sunday and the other provisions of Maryland law which permit various sports and entertainment on Sunday were clearly fashioned for \u2018the purpose of providing a Sunday atmosphere of recreation, cheerfulness, repose and enjoyment,\u2019 and then stated: \u2018* * * the constitutional safeguard is offended only if the classification rests on grounds wholly irrelevant to the achievement of the State\u2019s objective. State Legislatures are presumed to have acted within their constitutional power despite the fact that, in practice, their laws result in some inequality. A statutory discrimination will not be set aside if any state of facts reasonably may be conceived to justify it.\u2019 \u201d 233 Md. at 263</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">and then concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-8\">\u201cWe think, and therefore hold, the Act conforms with the Maryland scheme as delineated by the Supreme Court in the passage quoted above. The operation of large commercial markets or department stores on Sunday would materially interfere with the recreational atmos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>phere of the day, while small retail operations will not. And we think the classifications prescribed by the Act are reasonable and proper and are not of an invidious nature, <em>McGowan v. Maryland, supra, </em>being designed to prohibit on Sundays large commercial operations such as that here attempted by the Market.\u201d 233 Md. at 263-64</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">Since it appears to us that there was ample justification for the legislative determination that tranquillity and repose would be more likely assured if small business establishments operated on Sundays, while large ones did not, we find nothing arbitrary or discriminatory in the classification, nor do we think the classification rests, in the language of <em>McGowan, </em>\u201con grounds wholly irrelevant to the achievment of the State\u2019s objective.\u201d In fact, it is but a part of a thread which runs through the Sabbath Breaking provisions of Art. 27. In Montgomery County, retail establishments employing not more than six persons are excepted by \u00a7 534J; in Allegany and Baltimore Counties, establishments employing not more than three persons are excepted by \u00a7\u00a7 521 (f) and 534L, respectively, and in Harford and Wicomico Counties, establishments employing not more than two persons are excepted by \u00a7 534M.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">On the other hand, <em>West v. Town of Winnsboro, </em>252 La. 605, 211 So. 2d 665 (1967) relied on by the appellants, is clearly distinguishable on its facts. There, the Louisiana court struck down a town ordinance which permitted Sunday sales in grocery stores occupying no more than 1,600 square feet of enclosed space, provided they were owner-operated and had no more than one employee, because the effect of the ordinance, as drawn, permitted the operation of only three well established stores and excluded all others. An attempt had been made to justify the adoption of the ordinance on the theory that it minimized traffic congestion, but as the court observed, the effect was the reverse: traffic became concentrated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>at the three stores which were permitted to remain open. In short, this was an exemption of particular stores rather than a reasonable classification.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">In the case before us, the legislative purpose is clear, and the classification is reasonably structured to achieve that purpose. The shopping habits of the residents of the Bowie area are hardly relevant to the issue, for even if we assume that they are what the appellants allege them to be, it scarcely can be contended that they are frustrated by the legislative purpose to restrict business activity on Sundays to small stores.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">\n<em>Order affirmed; costs to be paid by appellants.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b371-12\">. It should be noted that there is no contention that any First Amendment right has been violated. Compare, as a matter of historical interest, <em>Judefind v.

The concurring opinion of Mr. Justice Frankfurter in <em>McGowan </em>struck a similar note:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-8\">\u201c* * * The restricted scope of this Court\u2019s review of state regulatory legislation under the Equal Protection Clause is of long standing. <em>Lindsley v. Natural Carbonic Gas Co., 220 U. S. 61, 78-79. </em>The applicable principles are that a state statute may not be struck down as offensive of equal protection in its schemes of classification unless it is obviously arbitrary, and that, except in the case of a statute whose discriminations are so patently without reason that no conceivable situation of fact could be found to justify them, the claimant who challenges the statute bears the burden of affirmative demonstration that in the actual state of facts which surround its operation, its classifications lack rationality.\u201d 366 U. S. 534-35 \u00ab* * * There is presented in this record not a trace of evidence as to the habits and customs of the population of Maryland or of Anne Arundel_ County, nothing that suggests that the pattern of legislation which their representatives have devised is not reasonably related to local circumstances determining their ways of life.
