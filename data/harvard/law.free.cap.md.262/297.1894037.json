A brief summary of the facts will demonstrate why we cannot do so under the applicable law.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">In May, 1966, the Baltimore County Zoning Commissioner reclassified as R. A. (Residence, apartment) a 38.94 acre tract in the County\u2019s eighth election district theretofore zoned R.10 and R.20 (Residence, one family, minimum lot size 10,000 and 20,000 square feet, respectively) . A timely appeal from the Zoning Commissioner\u2019s order to the County Board of Appeals was taken by Mr. and Mrs. Erroll B. Hay, III and Mr. and Mrs. Donald F. Nesbitt, Jr., none of whom is a party to the present controversy. It would appear that the appeal never came on for hearing because of an uncertainty as regards that portion of the property needed for the widening of the Baltimore Beltway. In September, 1970, a notice of dismissal of the Hay-Nesbitt appeal was filed by taeir counsel of record, and the Board entered an order of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">In October, 1970, Dr. Hitzrot and his neighbors sought to reinstate the proceeding by taking an appeal to the Circuit Court from the Board of Appeals\u2019 order of dismissal. They at once encountered an insurmountable obstacle: the procedural framework of Baltimore County\u2019s zoning law.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">Baltimore County Code (1968) \u00a7 22-27 authorizes any person aggrieved by a decision of the Zoning Commissioner to appeal to the County Board of Appeals within 30 days. The County\u2019s Charter \u00a7 604 and Code \u00a7 22-28, when read together, permit an appeal to the Circuit Court within 30 days of a decision of the Board of Appeals by \u201cany party to the proceeding who is aggrieved thereby * * *.\u201d Rule 3 b of the Rules of Practice and Procedure of County Board of Appeals, approved by the County Council by Bill No. 8 enacted in 1965, provides that \u201cAn appeal may be withdrawn or dismissed at <em>anytime </em>prior to the conclusion of the hearing on said appeal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">Since Dr. Hitzrot and his neighbors did not appeal from the order of the Zoning Commissioner, they were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>not parties to the proceeding before the Board of Appeals, and had no standing to appeal from whatever order the Board might have entered, <em>Bryniarski v. Montgomery County Board of Appeals, </em>247 Md. 137, 143, 230 A. 2d 289 (1967). When counsel of record for the persons who were the only parties gave notice of dismissal before the conclusion of the hearing and the Board of Appeals entered an order of dismissal, that ended the matter. There is simply no statutory support for the appellants\u2019 contention that the order of dismissal could not be entered without a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">\n<em>Order affirmed; costs to be paid by appellants.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
