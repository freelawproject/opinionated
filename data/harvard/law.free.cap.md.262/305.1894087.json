When the accident occurred, the insured, Phillip D. Sacratini (Sacratini or the insured), was an employee of the Tilo Company, a home improvement corporation which was a subsidiary of Reynolds Metals Company. Liberty Mutual had issued, for a number of years, a liability policy in which it insured Reynolds Metals and certain of its subsidiaries, including the Tilo Company. Tilo had, in turn, issued certificates of coverage to certain of its key employees, making each, by express endorsement, a named insured. Sacratini was such a named insured under the Liberty Mutual policy in regard to his ownership, maintenance, operation and use of a 1963 Cadillac automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">The Liberty Mutual policy had limits of $100,000 for each occurrence in regard to injury and $5,000 in regard to property damage. The policy was in effect from January 1,1966, through January 1,1967.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">Sacratini was also a named insured under the terms of a policy of automobile liability insurance issued by State Farm the morning of the accident\u2014December 30, 1966 \u2014which covered a 1966 Chevrolet automobile which had been acquired by Sacratini some two months earlier by trading his 1963 Cadillac. The record does not disclose that Liberty Mutual was advised of the newly acquired 1966 Chevrolet prior to the happening of the accident. Sacratini reported the accident to both Liberty Mutual and State Farm.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">Sacratini had been employed by the Tilo Company as the Branch Manager of the Baltimore office located in Timonium. Prior to the accident, the Tilo Company closed its office in Virginia, transferred its Virginia Branch Manager to the Baltimore office as a consequence of which Sacratini was demoted to Assistant Branch Manager with a reduction in compensation. Sacratini was dissatis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>fled with his new position and planned to leave his employment with the Tilo Company. He testified that he knew that as a Branch Manager of the Tilo Company, he was provided with the protection of a policy of automobile insurance but that no such protection was afforded for Assistant Branch Managers. He also had traded his 1963 Cadillac, scheduled in the Liberty Mutual policy, for a 1966 Chevrolet in October 1966 and testified that the financial institution through which he financed the purchase of the 1966 Chevrolet, required\u2014and he also desired\u2014collision insurance (the Liberty Mutual policy had neither collision nor comprehensive coverage), so that he applied for and received a binder for a new automobile insurance policy from State Farm containing both collision and comprehensive coverage covering his newly acquired 1966 Chevrolet. This new policy provided the insured with limits of $15,000 for each person and $30,000 for each occurrence as to injury and $5,000 as to property damage. As already indicated, there is no dispute that the new policy was in effect at the time of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">After the accident, the claims personnel of both Liberty Mutual and State Farm began an investigation of the accident. Sacratini was sued by claimants named Pit-kin and Fisher for damages resulting from Sacratini\u2019s alleged negligence. For approximately two years after the accident, the two insurance companies negotiated in regard to which company should respond to the risk. State Farm admitted it had a valid and operative insurance policy, but that Liberty Mutual was a co-insurer, and, as such, should participate in the defense and payment of the claims arising out of the accident. Liberty Mutual, on the other hand, contended that its policy would not respond in that there was an escape clause abrogating coverage if there was other valid and collectible insurance. No attempt was made during the discussions to implead or involve the Tilo Company. State Farm undertook the defense of the claims, without prejudice to its position in regard to Liberty Mutual, kept Liberty Mu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>tual fully advised concerning the progress of the cases, sending copies of all relevant pleadings and particulars, and continuously invited Liberty Mutual to participate. The Pitkin and Fisher claims had been fully developed and evaluated by State Farm and its counsel by September 1969. Settlement figures of $7,500 for personal injury and $525 for property damage were agreed upon in the Pitkin case and of $10,000 in the Fisher personal injury case. These settlement figures were submitted to Liberty Mutual for its approval and that company, with the benefit of all background material, agreed that the amounts of the proposed settlements were fair and reasonable, but adhered to its position that there was no coverage under its policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">On August 12, 1969, State Farm filed a petition for declaratory relief (later amended on March 30, 1970) in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County seeking a declaration that Liberty Mutual should reimburse State Farm for that proportion of the total sum paid by State Farm in the settlements which should be equal to the proportion to which the limits of the Liberty Mutual policy bear to the total limit of liability of the policies of both State Farm and Liberty Mutual and that Liberty Mutual should reimburse State Farm for a proportionate share of the costs incurred by State Farm in the defense of the Pitkin and Fisher lawsuits. Liberty Mutual in its answer maintained its position that there was no coverage under its policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">At the conclusion of the testimony before Judge Proctor, an oral opinion was rendered indicating that Liberty Mutual was liable on a pro rata basis for the amounts paid in settlement of the Pitkin and Fisher lawsuits and for 50% of the costs in defending those cases. By an order, filed October 7, 1970, this opinion was effectuated by the entry of judgment of $13,724.03 in favor of State Farm against Liberty Mutual as the latter\u2019s pro rata liability in the settlement of the cases and for $2,165.50 representing 50% of the fees and costs incurred by State Farm in defense of the cases and the prosecu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>tion of the declaratory judgment proceedings. Liberty Mutual took a timely appeal to this Court from the judgments entered. State Farm also took a timely cross-appeal from the judgments in order to challenge before us the alleged error of the trial court in its method of appor-. tioning the legal fees and costs. Inasmuch as we have concluded that there was no liability under the Liberty Mutual policy, we shall reverse the judgments below without considering the question raised by the cross-appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">The specific provisions of the Liberty Mutual policy will now be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">The Liberty Mutual policy contains a \u201cFamily Automobile Coverage\u201d endorsement, Form 1450 A, which contains the controlling provisions of the policy so far as the present case is concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">Paragraph 6 of the endorsements provides in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-7\">\u201c6. In Insuring Agreement IV of the policy, division (a), \u2018Automobile,\u2019 and division (b), \u2018Private Passenger Automobile,\u2019 are replaced by the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-8\">\u201cAutomobile. The word \u2018automobile\u2019 means: \u201cOwned Automobile</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-9\">\u201c(a) a private passenger, farm or utility automobile described in this policy for which a specific premium charge indicates that coverage is afforded,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-10\">\u201c(b) a trailer owned by the named insured,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-11\">\u201c(c) a private passenger, farm or utility automobile ownership of which is acquired by the named insured during the policy period, provided</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ANC\">\u201c(1) it replaces an owned automobile as defined in (a) above, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A1U\">\u201c (2) the company insures all private passenger, farm and utility automobiles owned by the named insured on the date of such ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>quisition and the named insured notifies the company during the policy period or within 30 days after the date of such acquisition of his election to make this and no other policy issued by the company applicable to such automobile, or * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">Then follow other definitions of \u201cPrivate Passenger Automobile,\u201d of \u201cFarm Automobile,\u201d of \u201cUtility Automobile,\u201d of \u201cTrailer\u201d and of \u201cAutomobile Business.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">Paragraph 7 provides for reimbursement of the insured for transportation expenses incurred during the period commencing 48 hours after the theft of an entire automobile covered by the policy has been reported to the police, with a limit of $10.00 a day and a total of $300.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">Then comes paragraph 8 which <em>replaces the Exclusions </em>in the policy (except exclusions (d), (j), (1) and (q)), not involved in the present case. It then provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-7\">\u201c(i) under coverages A and B, to the ownership, maintenance, operation, use, loading or unloading of an automobile ownership of which is acquired by the named insured during the policy period or any temporary substitute automobile therefor, if the named insured has purchased other automobile liability insurance applicable to such automobile for which a specific premium charge has been made; * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">It is apparent that the 1966 Chevrolet was <em>acquired </em>by the named insured (Sacratini) in October 1966\u2014during the Liberty Mutual policy period\u2014and that the named insured had purchased other automobile liability insurance from State Farm for the 1966 Chevrolet for which a specific premium charge had been made. In short, the factual situation in the present case fits precisely with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>in the language of the paragraph 8 exclusion from liability, unless some other provisions of the policy modify or change the meaning and effect of the paragraph 8 exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">The lower court was of the opinion that the definitions in paragraph 6, already set forth, did modify or make ambiguous the provisions of the paragraph 8 exclusion on the theory that in the paragraph 6 definition it is provided that a private passenger automobile is one the ownership of which is \u201cacquired\u201d by the named insured during the policy period, <em>provided </em>it <em>\u201creplaces\u201d </em>an owned automobile as defined in (a) above, so that the definition includes both acquisition and replacement whereas the paragraph 8 exclusion only uses the word \u201cacquired\u201d but not the word \u201creplacement\u201d or \u201creplaces.\u201d The trial court quoted from the Psalms that \u201cThe Lord giveth and the Lord hath taken away\u201d and expressed the opinion (in which we concur) that this did not apply to automobile liability insurance policies. The lower court, however, concluded that Liberty Mutual could not confer coverage in one part of the policy and take it away at another part of the policy. We do not concur in this conclusion, however, inasmuch (1) almost all liability policies do just that by conferring broad coverage in the first part of the policy only to narrow that broad coverage by exclusions, conditions, etc., later in the policy and (2) we find no conflict between the provisions of paragraphs 6 and 8, as properly construed.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">The provision in paragraph 6 (c) (1) in requiring that the automobile <em>acquired </em>by the named insured during the policy period \u201creplace\u201d the owned automobile defined in (a) is a limitation in the definition to prevent the coverage of vehicles acquired by the insured in <em>addition to the </em>vehicle covered by the policy for which Liberty Mutual would not have been paid a premium or perhaps not be aware of their existence as a possible source of liability. Paragraph 8 excludes liability for a vehicle acquired by the named insured <em>if </em>the insured <em>has purchased other automobile liability insurance </em>applicable to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>such automobile for which a specific permium has been charged. This exclusion is to prevent an overinsurance of an insured vehicle by the named insured and excludes coverage when the named insured purchases and looks to another policy for protection. The two provisions can reasonably be construed together to mean that if a named insured acquires another automobile during the policy period which does not replace the covered automobile, there is no liability because of the definition in paragraph 6 regardless of whether other liability insurance has been purchased; and if he acquires another vehicle during the policy period and obtains other insurance covering that vehicle, liability is excluded by the provisions of paragraph 8, even if the acquired vehicle does replace a covered automobile. In summary, the provisions of paragraph 6, as properly construed, do not modify or make ambiguous the provisions of paragraph 8, which provisions are clear and unambiguous and clearly apply to facts in the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">The Liberty Mutual policy is a contract and the intention of the parties is to be discovered primarily by the language used in the policy itself. <em>Shillman v. Hobstetter, </em>249 Md. 678, 688, 241 A. 2d 570 (1968). If that language is clear and unambiguous, there is no need to invoke the secondary rules of construction used by the Courts when the language is ambiguous. <em>Schapiro v. Jefferson, </em>203 Md. 372, 378, 100 A. 2d 794 (1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">Our construction of the provisions of paragraph 8 is in accord with our decision in <em>Consolidated Insurance Co. v. Bankers Insurance Co., </em>244 Md. 392, 223 A. 2d 594 (1966), where we pointed out that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-6\">\u201c \u2018Other insurance\u2019 clauses were originated in the property insurance field in order to protect the insurer from the \u2018moral hazard\u2019 resulting from the over-insurance of property. These clauses sought to discourage intentionally and fraudulently inflicted self-injury to the insured\u2019s property, and received ready enforcement by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>the courts. Although the \u2018moral hazard\u2019 of over-insurance is not present in the liability field, \u2018other insurance\u2019 clauses in this area of the law are neither invalid nor unconscionable and also have met with uniform judicial recognition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-4\">\u201cThree general types of \u2018other insurance\u2019 clauses commonly appear in modern automobile liability policies: (1) the <em>escape </em>clause, whereby the policy is declared not to cover the insured in a double coverage situation; (2) the <em>excess </em>clause, whereby the insurer declares itself liable up to the limits of its policy only for the excess amount, if any, necessary to indemnify the insured after the other insurer has paid to the full limit of its coverage; (3) the <em>pro-rata </em>clause, whereby the insurer obligates itself for a ratable share of the loss in the same proportion which the limit of its own policy coverage bears to the aggregate total coverage protecting the insured.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-5\">(244 Md. at 395-96)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">The provisions of paragraph 8 constitute an \u201cescape\u201d clause and, as such, were intended by the parties to exclude coverage in a double coverage situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">See <em>Couch on Insurance </em>2d, Section 45:182 at p. 233:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-8\">\u201c[T]he so-called \u2018automatic insurance\u2019 clauses generally read as follows: \u2018Automatic Insurance For Newly Acquired Automobiles.\u2019 If the. named Insured who is the owner of the automobile acquires ownership of another automobile, such insurance as is afforded by this policy applies also to such other automobile as of the date of its delivery to him, subject to the following additional conditions: (1) if the Company insures all automobiles owned by the named Insured at the date of such delivery, insurance applies to such other automobile, if it is used for pleasure purposes or in the business of the named In<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>sured as expressed in the declarations, but only to the extent applicable to all such previously owned automobiles; (2) if the Company does not insure all automobiles owned by the named insured at the date of such delivery, insurance applies to such other automobile, if it replaces an automobile described in this policy and may be classified for the purpose of use stated in the policy, but only to the extent applicable to the replaced automobile; (3) the insurance afforded by this policy automatically terminates upon the replaced automobile at the date of such delivery; and (4) this agreement does not apply (a) <em>to any loss against which the named Insured has other valid and collectible insurance, </em>nor (b) unless the named insured notifies the Company within ten days following the date of delivery of such other automobile, nor (c) except during the policy period, but if the date of delivery of such other automobile is prior to the effective date of this policy the insurance applies as of the effective date of this policy, nor (d) unless the named insured pays any additional premium required because of the application of this insurance to the said automobile.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-4\">(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">In <em>Continental Casualty Co. v. Weekes, </em>74 So. 2d 367 (Fla. 1954), one Parnell was operating an automobile owned by Acme when the vehicle was involved in an accident. Acme was insured by the Continental Casualty Company, the policy providing under Section 3, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-6\">\u201c (b) The insurance does not apply:\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-7\">\u2666 * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-8\">\u201c(4) to any liability for such loss as is covered on a primary, contributory, excess, or any other basis by insurance in another insurance company.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>Parnell was insured personally by Aetna Casualty and Surety Company and, although he was covered by the policy while driving other automobiles, the policy also provided that the coverage should be \u201cexcess insurance over any other valid and collectible insurance available\u201d to him. The trial court, in considering whether the Continental policy constituted \u201cother valid and collectible insurance\u201d within the meaning of Aetna\u2019s policy, held that Continental was liable to the extent of its policy limits for all amounts the plaintiffs in the negligence actions might recover and gave no effect to clause 3 (b) (4) of Continental\u2019s policy. The Supreme Court of Florida reversed this decision and, in sustaining Section 3 (b) (4), the escape clause of Continental\u2019s policy, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-4\">\u201cOur search of the authorities has convinced us that only two cases which are sufficiently close in their policy provisions to render them highly persuasive have been decided on the point before us. The cases are <em>Penn. v. National Union Indemnity Co., 5 </em>Cir., 68 F. 2d 567, and <em>McFarland v. Chicago Express, Inc., </em>7 Cir., 200 F. 2d 5. In each case the liability of the insurer or insurers, if any, arose out of a single set of circumstances, as here, and in each case one of the policies, but not the other, contained language importing that no coverage would exist thereunder if other coverage were provided. The respective courts in both cases gave full effect to this language.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">The Florida Supreme Court then stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-7\">\u201cIt will be noted that the language of the Employer\u2019s policy provided that it should be \u2018null and void\u2019, while here the Continental policy states that \u2018this insurance does not apply\u2019, but the effect of the two clauses under these facts was the same, and we consider this distinction to be insignificant here. Moreover, the Employ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>er\u2019s policy provided contingent liability for excess insurance, while Continental\u2019s policy does not; therefore, if the Employer\u2019s policy was not \u2018valid and collectible insurance\u2019 within the meaning of the policy of the lessee\u2019s insurer, a fortiori, Continental\u2019s policy is not. As a matter of construction, clause 3(b) (4) of Continental\u2019s policy should have been enforced by the trial Court, and we so hold.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">The Florida Supreme Court continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-5\">\u201cIt remains to consider whether or not this clause is contrary to public policy or to law, <em>Penn. v. National Union Indemnity Co., supra, </em>68 F. 2d 567. There is no basis in the record before us for the conclusion that public policy will be violated by the enforcement of clause 3(b) (4), although we cannot and do not hold that this will be true in every case. For aught that appears here, sufficient financial responsibility is provided for the protection of the public, and this is nothing more than a contest between insurance companies.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">When the Florida Supreme Court considered the public interest and the Florida financial responsibility laws, the Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-8\">\u201cThe ordinance plainly intends to protect the public from financial irresponsibility. As we observed at the beginning of this opinion, there is no doubt that Continental\u2019s policy would have covered Parnell had it not been for the insurance provided by Aetna, and it is not contended that the Aetna coverage is insufficient in amount to comply with the ordinance. It appears that the coverage contemplated by the ordinance is satisfied and the public protected within its terms.\u201d (74 So. 2d 368-69)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>See also <em>Continental Casualty Co. v. Suttenfield, </em>236 F. 2d 433 (5th Cir. 1956); <em>Allstate Insurance Co. v. Shelby Mutual Insurance Co., </em>269 N. C. 341, 152 S.E.2d 436 (1967); <em>Government Employees Insurance Co. v. Globe Indemnity Co., </em>415 S.W.2d 581 (Ky. 1967); <em>American Employer\u2019s Insurance Co. v. Liberty Mutual Insurance Co., </em>93 N.

B 1937).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">It may be added that the suggestion that Condition 18, \u201cOther Insurance\u201d of the Liberty Mutual policy, presents an ambiguity when read in the light of the exclusion in paragraph 8 (i) of the endorsement is unsound. When the exclusion operated to eliminate coverage under the policy, Condition 18 which only applies to a \u201closs covered by the policy\u201d could not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">Nor is the inclusion of the exclusion in paragraph 8 (i) in the Liberty Mutual policy contrary to any statutory provision. No prohibition of such an escape clause is contained in Maryland Code (1970 Repl. Vol.), Art. 66%, \u00a7 7-324 and such clauses are in regular use in the insurance field as we observed in <em>Consolidated Mutual Insurance Co. v. Bankers Insurance Co., </em>244 Md. 392, 223 A. 2d 594 (1966), <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">Finally, it should be observed that the present case is a controversy between two liability insurance companies in regard to the liability <em>between </em>themselves-for the damages resulting to the injured members of the public and does not involve any rights of such injured persons under either policy. The purposes set forth in Art. 66%, \u00a7 7-324 et seq., of the Maryland Code (the Act of 1943, Ch. 1007, as amended) are in no way involved in the controversy between the two liability insurance companies.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">Liberty Mutual, for the reasons stated, is not liable to State Farm for any part of the damages arising from the accident of December 30, 1966, and was under no obligation to defend or contribute to the cost of the defense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>or settlement of the resulting actions by those injured and damaged. Liberty Mutual\u2019s motion to dismiss should have been granted by the lower court and the judgments entered on October 7, 1970, against Liberty Mutual in favor of State Farm must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-3\">In view of our decision that the judgments should be reversed, it is not necessary to consider the alleged error of the trial court in assessing the damages raised by State Farm in its cross-appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">\n<em>Judgments reversed, the appellee State Farm Automobile Insurance Company to pay the costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
