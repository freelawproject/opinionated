Because there was no statutory basis to impose negligence liability on the defendants, we affirm summary judgments in their favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-4\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b924-5\">On February 15, 1998, police officers took 13-year-old Michael William Wilson (Michael) to Polinsky<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> after he telephoned 911 and reported that his grandfather, with whom he was living, was drunk and had struck him on the head with the telephone when he was trying to talk to his mother, who was incarcerated.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-6\">The following afternoon, Michael telephoned his father in Northern California and asked to be picked up from Polinsky. His father said, \u201cI can\u2019t come and get you right now.\u201d According to the father, he was \u201cin a relationship with a pretty special woman,\u201d was \u201cbeing pulled . . . between him and her,\u201d and \u201ccouldn\u2019t have Michael all the time.\u201d Michael \u201cgot mad and said he was going to take off or that he was going to kill himself, and hung up the phone on [his father].\u201d The father did not notify Polinsky staff about Michael\u2019s threat. That evening Michael ran away from Polinsky, unbeknownst to its staff. He was struck by a car and seriously injured when he darted onto Clairemont Mesa Boulevard.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-7\">Michael, through his father as guardian ad litem, sued County for negligence and negligent infliction of emotional distress.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Michael alleged that children taken into protective custody are \u201cin extreme emotional states, frightened, paranoid, insecure, and subject to running away,\u201d and thus it was foreseeable he was at such risk and County had a duty to prevent him from running away from Polinsky. County moved for summary judgment, arguing there is no statutory basis for its liability. The court granted the motion, finding that County sustained its burden of showing that Michael \u201ccannot establish the essential element that [it] breached a mandatory duty owed to [him].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b924-8\">Michael amended his complaint to substitute parties in place of Doe defendants: Geraldine Flaven, a program administrator at Polinsky and a County employee; Professional Resource Enterprises, Inc., doing business as STAT Nurses Registry (STAT), an employment agency that provided residential care workers to Polinsky; and, Michael Polite and Christine Johnson, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"979\">*979</page-number>STAT employees who were on duty at Polinsky the evening Michael ran away.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-4\">Flaven moved for summary judgment on the grounds that her duty, as a public employee, was commensurate with County\u2019s and, in any event, she was not on duty when Michael was at Polinsky. The court granted the motion on the same ground that it granted County\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-5\">STAT, Polite and Johnson subsequently obtained summary judgment on the grounds that Polite and Johnson were \u201cspecial employees of. . . County by virtue of the degree of control exerted over the performance of [their] duties while employed at Polinsky.\u201d As employees of County, Polite and Johnson had no duty to prevent Michael from running away from Polinsky, and STAT could have no vicarious liability for their conduct. Judgments were entered for all defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b925-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b925-8\">\n<em>Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b925-9\">\u201cTo prevail on [an] action [for] negligence, plaintiff must show that [the] defendants owed [him or] her a legal duty, that they breached the duty, and that the breach was a proximate or legal cause of [his or] her injuries. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Sharon P. v. Arman, Ltd. </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 1181, 1188 [91 Cal.Rptr.2d 35, 989 P.2d 121].) Because \u201cduty is an issue of law to be decided by the court, the applicability of that defense [lack of duty] is amenable to resolution by summary judgment.\u201d <em>(Freeman v. Hale </em>(1994) 30 Cal.App.4th 1388, 1395 [36 Cal.Rptr.2d 418].) A de novo standard of review applies, and we must \u201cstrictly construe the moving party\u2019s papers and liberally construe those of the opposing party to determine if they raise a triable issue of material fact.\u201d <em>(Stimson </em>v. <em>Carlson </em>(1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 1201, 1205 [14 Cal.Rptr.2d 670].)</p>\n<p id=\"b925-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b925-11\">\n<em>Liability of Public Agencies and Their Employees</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b925-12\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b925-13\">The California Tort Claims Act (Gov. Code, \u00a7 810 et seq.) bars liability against public agencies and their employees except as specifically provided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"980\">*980</page-number>by statute. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 815.) Government Code section 815.6 provides: \u201cWhere a public entity is under a <em>mandatory duty imposed by an enactment </em>that is designed to protect against the risk of a particular kind of injury, the public entity is liable for an injury of that kind proximately caused by its failure to discharge the duty unless the public entity establishes that it exercised reasonable diligence to discharge the duty.\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7 815.6, (Italics added.)  \u201cBefore the [public agency] will be required to confront a rebuttable presumption of negligence [citation], plaintiff must demonstrate that: (1) the statute which was violated imposes a mandatory duty, (2) the statute was intended to protect against the type of harm suffered, and (3) breach of the statute\u2019s mandatory duty was a proximate cause of the injury suffered. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Braman </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1994) 28 Cal.App.4th 344, 349 [33 Cal.Rptr.2d 608].)</p>\n<p id=\"b926-6\">Michael asserts that Welfare and Institutions Code<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> section 300.2 imposed a mandatory duty on County and its employees to \u201cstop [him] as he was running away,\u201d and to \u201ckeep him safe and protected by not giving him any chance to attempt to run away.\u201d Section 300.2 states the purpose of juvenile dependency law (\u00a7 300 et seq.) \u201cis to provide maximum safety and protection for children who are currently being physically, sexually, or emotionally abused, being neglected, or being exploited, and to ensure the safety, protection, and physical and emotional well-being of children who are at risk of that harm. This safety, protection, and physical and emotional well-being may include provision of a full array of social and health services to help the child and family and to prevent reabuse of children. The focus shall be on the preservation of the family as well as the safety, protection, and physical and emotional well-being of the child. . . .\u201d (\u00a7 300.2.)</p>\n<p id=\"b926-7\">As our Supreme Court has explained, \u201capplication of [Government Code] section 815.6 requires that the enactment at issue be <em>obligatory, </em>rather than merely discretionary or permissive, in its directions to the public entity; it must <em>require, </em>rather than merely authorize or permit, <em>that a particular action be taken or not taken. </em>[Citation.]\u201d <em>(Haggis v. City of Los Angeles </em>(2000) 22 Cal.4th 490, 498 [93 Cal.Rptr.2d 327, 993 P.2d 983], last italics added.)  Section 300.2 does not require a public agency to take any <em>particular action. </em>Rather, it recites legislative goals and policies that must be implemented through a public agency\u2019s exercise of judgment. (See <em>Ibarra </em>v. <em>California Coastal Com. </em>(1986) 182 Cal.App.3d 687, 694 [227 Cal.Rptr. 371].) Section 300.2 cannot reasonably be interpreted to impose a mandatory duty on public agencies to guarantee the safety of dependent children in all circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"981\">*981</page-number>Moreover, Michael\u2019s duty argument is belied by the statutory requirement that public agencies place dependent minors alleged or adjudged to come within section 300 in \u201cnonsecure\u201d facilities, and to segregate them from minors who are detained for delinquency. (\u00a7 206.) \u201cThe term \u2018nonsecure facility\u2019 means a facility that is not characterized by the use of physically restricting construction, hardware, and procedures and which provides its residents access to the surrounding community with minimal supervision.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b927-4\">To comply with section 206, Polinsky adopted a written AWOL (absent without leave) policy that prohibits the physical restraint of a child over 12 years of age who is not developmentally delayed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In a 1998 \u201cSecurity Inspection Report,\u201d County\u2019s juvenile justice commission wrote: \u201cIt is the intent that [Polinsky] not be a secure lock-up facility, and it is not considered one. It is the type of setting where children must feel safe but not incarcerated as if they committed a crime. This philosophy presents issues that inhibit normal techniques of securing facilities that would resist intrusion or AWOL activity.\u201d (Original underscoring.)</p>\n<p id=\"b927-5\">Under section 206, the public agency\u2019s control over the \u201cingress and egress\u201d of juvenile dependents in a nonsecure facility is characterized as being \u201cno greater than that exercised by a prudent parent.\u201d (\u00a7 206.) Caretakers of dependent children are said to act in loco parentis. <em>(In re Nicole B. </em>(1979) 93 Cal.App.3d 874, 880 [155 Cal.Rptr. 916].) In <em>Gibson </em>v. <em>Gibson </em>(1971) 3 Cal.3d 914, 922 [92 Cal.Rptr. 288, 479 P.2d 648], the court abolished parental tort immunity. However, a parent\u2019s negligence liability is typically based on a direct nexus between his or her affirmative conduct, such as the operation of a car, and the child\u2019s injury. (See <em>id. </em>at p. 921.) The <em>Gibson </em>court explained that although a parent does not have \u201ccarte blanche to act negligently toward his [or her] child,\u201d \u201cthe parent-child relationship is unique in some aspects, and . . . traditional concepts of negligence cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"982\">*982</page-number>be blindly applied to it.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Michael cites no authority to support a contention that a parent owes a duty to an adolescent to prevent him or her from running away from home.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-4\">Michael also relies on Polinsky\u2019s \u201cChild Care Worker Manual,\u201d which provided that \u201c[s]taff must be alert, knowing where each child is at all times; staff is expected to supervise and maintain appropriate play activities. Children are to be within view at all times.\u201d The manual also stated that \u201c[c]hildren must always be supervised by an authorized adult while at [Polinsky]. Under no circumstances is a child to be out of the sight of . . . staff or another designated adult unless the child is sleeping.\u201d Further, it was Polinsky\u2019s policy to assign a worker to an individual child in a variety of circumstances, including \u201c[c]hronic AWOL behaviors.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b928-5\">The term \u201cenactment\u201d as used in Government Code section 815.6 means \u201ca constitutional provision, statute, charter provision, ordinance or regulation.\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7 810.6.) \u201cThis definition is intended to refer to all measures of a formal legislative or quasi-legislative nature.\u201d (Cal. Law Revision Com. com., 32 West\u2019s Ann. Gov. Code (1995 ed.) foil. \u00a7 810.6, p. 155.) The term \u201cregulation,\u201d as used in Government Code section 810.6 means \u201ca rule, regulation, order or standard, having the force of law, adopted . . . as a regulation by an agency of the state pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act [Act].\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7 811.6.)</p>\n<p id=\"b928-6\">\u201cThe . . . Act rulemaking provisions apply to <em>most state agencies </em>and their regulations. [Citations.] There are significant exceptions, however, both as to the agencies and types of regulations ocovered. [Citation.]\u201d (9 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (4th ed. 1997) Administrative Proceedings, \u00a7 32, p. 1085, original italics; Gov. Code, \u00a7 11340 et seq.) For instance, the Act does not apply to \u201c[a] regulation that relates only to the internal management of the state agency\u201d or \u201c[a] regulation that is directed to a specifically named person or to a group of persons and does not apply generally throughout the state.\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7 11340.9, subds. (d) &amp; (i).)  Michael does not contend, and has not demonstrated, that Polinsky\u2019s employee manual constitutes an administrative regulation within the meaning of the Act. Accordingly, the manual imposed no mandatory duties on County or its employees. (See <em>Hucko v. City of San Diego </em>(1986) 179 Cal.App.3d 520, 522, fn. 1 [224 Cal.Rptr. 552].)</p>\n<p id=\"b928-7\">Michael\u2019s reliance on <em>Hoyem v. Manhattan Beach City Sch. Dist. </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 508 [150 Cal.Rptr. 1, 585 P.2d 851] is misplaced. In <em>Hoyem, </em>a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"983\">*983</page-number>10-year-old boy was injured after leaving the school campus without permission. The court held the school district was not exonerated from liability as a matter of law for claims that it negligently supervised the child on school grounds. The court relied on former title 5 of the California Administrative Code, section 303, which provided: \u201c \u2018A pupil may not leave the school premises at recess, or at any other time before the regular hour for closing school, except in case of emergency, or with the approval of the principal of the school.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Hoyem, supra, </em>at p. 514; Cal. Code Regs., tit. 5, \u00a7 303.) The court explained it \u201cha[d] no doubt that this rule is at least in part for the pupils\u2019 protection, and that the school authorities therefore bore the duty to exercise ordinary care to enforce the rule.\u201d <em>(Hoyem, supra, </em>at p. 514.) Here, County and its employees had no statutory duty to ensure that Michael not leave Polinsky. <em>Taylor v. Oakland. Scavenger Co. </em>(1941) 17 Cal.2d 594 [110 P.2d 1044] and <em>Dailey </em>v. <em>Los Angeles Unified Sch. Dist. </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 741 [87 Cal.Rptr. 376, 470 P.2d 360] are similarly unhelpful.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-4\">We are sympathetic to Michael\u2019s plight. We are, however, constrained to hold that County and Flaven were entitled to summary judgment on the grounds they had no mandatory duty to prevent him from running away from Polinsky. While perhaps one-on-one care should have been provided Michael, the decision was discretionary, not mandatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b929-6\">Michael contends he raised triable issues regarding whether Polite and Johnson were independent contractors as opposed to \u201cspecial employees\u201d of County, and thus the summary judgment for them and STAT was improper.  \u201cWhether a person is an employee or an independent contractor is ordinarily a question of fact but if from all the facts only one inference may be drawn it is a question of law.\u201d <em>(Brose v. Union-Tribune Publishing Co. </em>(1986) 183 Cal.App.3d 1079, 1081 [228 Cal.Rptr. 620].)</p>\n<p id=\"b929-7\">\u201c \u2018An \u201cindependent contractor\u201d is generally defined as a person who is employed by another to perform work; who pursues an \u201cindependent employment or occupation\u201d in performing it; and who follows the employer\u2019s \u201cdesires only as to the results of the work, and not as to the means whereby it is to be accomplished.\u201d [Citations.] The most significant factor in determining the existence of an employer-independent contractor relationship is the right to control the manner and means by which the work is to be performed. [Citations.] \u201cIf control may be exercised only as to the result of the work and not the means by which it is accomplished, an independent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"984\">*984</page-number>contractor relationship is established.\u201d [Citations.]\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Millsap </em>v. <em>Federal Express Corp. </em>(1991) 227 Cal.App.3d 425, 431 [277 Cal.Rptr. 807].)</p>\n<p id=\"b930-4\">\u201cA \u2018special employment\u2019 relationship arises when an employer lends an employee to another employer and relinquishes to the borrowing employer all right of control over the employee\u2019s activities. [Citation.] The borrowed employee is \u2018 \u201cheld to have two employers\u2014his original or \u2018general\u2019 employer and a second, the \u2018special\u2019 employer.\u201d \u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Riley v. Southwest Marine, Inc. </em>(1988) 203 Cal.App.3d 1242, 1247-1248 [250 Cal.Rptr. 718].) During periods of \u201ctransferred control, the special employer becomes solely liable under the doctrine of respondeat superior for the employee\u2019s job-related torts.\u201d <em>(Marsh v. Tilley Steel Co. </em>(1980) 26 Cal.3d 486, 492 [162 Cal.Rptr. 320, 606 P.2d 355].) \u201cThe special employment relationship and its consequent imposition of liability upon the special employer flows from the borrower\u2019s power to supervise the details of the employee\u2019s work.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b930-5\">The trial court determined that \u201cdefendants have established, and plaintiff has failed to controvert, that Polinsky controlled and directed the essential duties of defendant\u2019s work. . . .\u201d (Original capitalization omitted.) We agree with this assessment. In declarations, Polite and Johnson stated they (1) received their work schedules and daily work assignments from Polinsky, (2) \u201creceived training in the performance of [their] duties as . . . residential care worker[s] from County employees,\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (3) were \u201cexpected to follow and implement . . . County . . . policies and procedures for Polinsky,\u201d (4) were \u201cunder the supervision and received direction in performance of [their] duties from a Residential Care Supervisor and other County employees in supervisory positions,\u201d and (5) were not supervised by STAT in the performance of their work at Polinsky. An employee supervisor at Polinsky testified in deposition that workers provided by STAT \u201cwere supervised in the same manner as any County employee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b930-6\">Michael offered no evidence suggesting County did not control the manner and means by which Polite and Johnson performed their work. Evidence that STAT contracted to provide County a \u201ccertain number of man hours of work per year\u201d and assigned Polite and Johnson to Polinsky does not create a triable issue of material fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-7\">The court correctly determined that Polite and Johnson were \u201cspecial employees\u201d of County. Accordingly, as with the County and Flaven, no duty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"985\">*985</page-number>to prevent Michael from running away from Polinsky can be attributed to Polite, Johnson or STAT.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-4\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b931-5\">The judgments are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-6\">Benke, Acting P.

While it is recognized that for some older children running away has become an adaptive response to situational pressure, such behavior is considered high risk. For this reason it is difficult to prevent a child from running away from an unlocked facility like [Polinsky]. [^] Staff can help minimize runaway behavior .... Diligent supervision, active programming, and concerned sensitive staff can and do make a difference with the majority of children. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b927-7\">The policy advocated AWOL prevention by having staff do such things as \u201cbuild rapport with each new child who enters [Polinsky],\u201d \u201cbe available when a child wants to talk,\u201d \u201cbe alert to AWOL plans and use active supervision techniques,\u201d \u201cbe aware of the location and change of location of each child at all times,\u201d \u201c[o]pposing the minor by . . . creating] a barrier to the child\u2019s movement,\u201d and \u201c[fjollowing the minor.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b928-8\"> Michael had apparently run away from Polinsky on a previous occasion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b930-8\"> Michael asserts that \u201c[t]here was no job training at [Polinsky], only staff and resident interaction.\u201d However, in his responsive separate statement, Michael conceded it was undisputed that \u201cJohnson and Polite received training to perform their job duties from . . .
